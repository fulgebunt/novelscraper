Beyond the prison cell, contemptuous eyes flashed.\u201cHow dare you poison the Madam. Know this\u2014you will never walk out of this prison alive. How despicable. You don\u2019t even know any grace.\u201dAlbert, the guard who brought me here, gritted his teeth and pretended to spit. Fortunately, he turned around without actually spitting, but what he said was clear enough.If the findings would really turn out as me being the one responsible for the poisoning, I wouldn\u2019t ever be able to get out of this prison alive. As an orphan from a faraway land and an ordinary servant, it wouldn\u2019t be strange if I disappeared.\u201cAlbert! Albert! Please allow me one thing. Please let me see the Count!\u201dI shouted with all my might as I held the prison bars tightly.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me! I wasn\u2019t the one who mixed poison in the Madam\u2019s tea! I know who the real culprit is\u2014please let me see the Count!\u201d\u201cWhat you\u2019re saying doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s you who brought the poisoned tea leaves. Who else is the culprit? Who are you going to blame for your crime?\u201dHe spat and pointed a finger at me, seething in something like genuine rage.\u201cI didn\u2019t do it! The real culprit is\u2026!\u201d\u201cThe real culprit?\u201dAs soon as I was about to say the name of the real sinner, a quiet voice rang through the air. My tongue hardened reflexively, and his cold presence permeated into my skin.\u00a0Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump. The pounding of my heart was so loud that my eardrums were about to burst. The even sound of his footsteps over the stone floor sent shivers down my spine.He\u2019s coming.\u201cGoodness, Young Master. You shouldn\u2019t be in a place like this!\u201dInstead of towards me, as I was so frozen to the point that even my fingertips couldn\u2019t move, the guard made a fuss over that man. The guard\u2019s voice became smaller, and now only\u00a0his\u00a0approaching footsteps echoed into my ears. The moment he finally stopped in front of me, I couldn\u2019t face him.\u201cYoung Master, if you do this, I\u2019ll be in big trouble with the Count.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Albert. I\u2019ll explain it to my father properly.\u201d\u201cGoodness, Young Master\u2026 What if I really get into big trouble.\u201dAlbert just shifted his weight on one foot to the other without knowing what to do, but Adrian answered his worries leisurely. Perhaps because it was only me and Albert here with him, but the angel-like appearance he reserved for the public had long since disappeared. All I could feel from him was the pressure and fear that weighed heavily over my head\u2026\u201cTell me. The real culprit that you know, who is it, hm?\u201dHe asked with a beautiful, lilting voice that everyone praised. And in turn, I was just shaking without moving from where I was standing. It was faint, but the sound of my teeth chattering could be heard.\u00a0Hmm.\u00a0As though contemplating, he hummed and stared at me intently.\u201cI knew it. You\u2019re different.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou know, hm? Who I am, what I did.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHow did you know? I\u2019m good enough at it that no one should have known.\u201dRather than anger, all that was in his gaze towards me was interest. My body flinched reflexively as though I\u2019d been stabbed by a blade. The more I appeared to be frightened, the darker his smile became. I didn\u2019t dare to look up to face him, but I could still feel his change in demeanor.Adrian Caesar von der Paltzgraff.The successor to the Paltzgraff family.The world praised him as an angel\u2014but only I knew. The public was set abuzz by the news of the recent serial murders and attempted murders, and that all of them had been committed by a handsome young man.No, it was only me who knew.That the world I\u2019m living in right now is a crazily ridiculous horror game.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Koreans do a lot of grinding in games, too. (1)Translated by YonneeEdited by \u2014Until a few months ago, I was just a run-of-the-mill gamer who liked playing games. I would buy a game that looks fun, play it, but only until a point where I wouldn\u2019t need to spend a lot of money. After I got a job, I had to focus on my work, so I had to give up many games, but I still tried out a few new games once in a while.But that day was different. That day was so painstaking that I bought some alcohol, even though I couldn\u2019t hold my liquor, on my way home from work. Because I was already drunk, not even a few drinks in, I clicked on some \u2018horror game\u2019 reviews by mistake. I usually don\u2019t play games of this genre because I\u2019m too much of a scaredy cat.\u201cThere\u2019s so many new horror games.\u201dI scrolled down and looked through the game titles that filled the main page. In general, what could be seen were black and red monsters and ghosts that had an ominous atmosphere to them. If I had been sober, I would have closed the window immediately because I\u2019d be scared, but this time, I wasn\u2019t all that frightened. Maybe because I was drunk.Why do people play horror games anyway?Unless it was really a hobby, I couldn\u2019t understand the appeal to such things. Even so, I did still have some curiosity about it.While clicking on a review or looking down at some posts with a lack of sincerity, I eventually stopped scrolling because I noticed a title that\u2019s been repeated for a while now.\u2018The House of Paltzgraff\u2019s Murderer.\u2019\u201cHmm, isn\u2019t this the game I saw earlier? The new A-Comms game\u2026\u201dCrushing a can of beer that I just downed and throwing it away somewhere, I began to read the review again more attentively. A-Comms made games that had minor sensitive themes, but the company was famous for their elaborate OSTs, plus their historical backgrounds and stories, so there was always a lot of hype from their fans every time a new game was released.They released much better work than most mass-produced games that saturated the market, so expectations were always high. Perhaps that\u2019s also why they were hit with a ton of criticism, too.People anticipated the release for this game and bought it as soon as it came out, but apparently it wasn\u2019t good, it\u2019s buggy, it\u2019s disappointing\u2026 The more bad reviews I read, the more curious I became.How bad of a flop was this game that all the reviews were saying it\u2019s indeed a flop?No way, it might not really be a total failure. What most game communities on the internet called flops were actually masterpieces. The more cynical bashers there were, the better the game might be and the higher the sales ranking would be.It\u2019s a strange correlation, but this was reality. Even more so for A-Comms games.\u201cI\u2019m curious. Should I give it a go\u2026\u201dEven while saying this, my hand already brought me to the A-Comms website and I\u2019ve already finalized my check-out. It wasn\u2019t too long until the game was fully downloaded and booted up.As soon as I clicked open, my entire screen became stained with dark red blood. Along with the sound of the classic thunder and lightning through the rain, a magnificent mansion appeared.It was just like A-Comms, since they were especially particular with artistic details, that the mansion was elegantly designed with a European architectural style that could be seen in any movie. Just this alone made me doubt if I bought this in Korean Won or another currency.I casually chewed on my leftover snacks as the menu appeared on the right side of the screen.\u2605 New Game\u2605 ExitAs I clicked on my selection on the simple menu, the screen turned black once again, and the magnificent yet gloomy orchestral score of the OST began to play, the deep tones of a cello taking precedence of the melody.And then\u2014\u201cAh! What the hell!\u201dWith a terrible scream, a man\u2019s face filled the monitor. I was so surprised that I almost fell out of my seat, but as the face got smaller. I managed to calm down and sit properly again.The man was so pale that even his veins were visible on his skin. No, wait, he seemed to be a little younger than an older man\u2026 The young man looked exactly into my eyes and lifted something. It didn\u2019t take long for me to realize that it was a woman\u2019s head, lopped right off from her body.She had bloody and tangled hair, and she had the frozen expression of fear she had right before she died, her eyes not yet closed\u2026 Because the frame was drawn so realistically, I even thought that it looked like a picture.Eventually, when he began to chew on the woman\u2019s head, my brows became furrowed.\u201cWhat the, what kind of minor sensitive themes\u2026 This is just gross.\u201dAt one point, the young man\u2019s actions began to slow down, and words began to appear on the monitor.There was a brief explanation of the game\u2019s worldbuilding, and the plot roughly went like this\u2014The devils\u2019 underworld had been reigned over by monarchs for the longest time, and the monarch\u2019s daughter, Lilith, had been dominating the country. It\u2019s said that there were two factions, splitting the devildom in half.The strongest being in hell, Satan, was the representative of the monarch\u2019s faction and decided to stand against Lilith. The devildom then became divided between those who stood behind Satan and those who stood behind Lilith. And so, the two factions lead a boring war of attrition\u2026On the day when Lilith was on the verge of becoming completely destroyed with an overwhelming power, she decided to sacrifice her life in order to cast terrible curses upon Satan.Satan, who lost all his strength, opened his eyes and found that he now had a human body. He was left with no choice but to live like a vampire, killing humans and absorbing their life force.He\u2019d kill, and he\u2019d kill again.Until he could regain all his power and become a complete being once more, or perhaps, until he was executed as a murderer.The game\u2019s player was set to play as the Count household\u2019s young master, Adrian Caesar von der Paltzgraff. If he were to be executed or if he were to violate the rules of the game before gaining his full power, it would be game over.\u201cThis worldbuilding is kinda depressing.\u201dThere was an illustration there of a body being ripped open and eaten\u2026 It\u2019s just\u00a0too\u00a0grotesque.I shouldn\u2019t have bought this. I wonder if I should get a refund now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Koreans do a lot of grinding in games, too. (2)Translated by YonneeEdited by \u2014After a short consideration, I clicked on the screen and the monitor became bright.The magnificent mansion I saw in the home page of the game showed off an even more opulent splendor in the light of the sun. It had pristine white walls that had no faded parts, exquisitely sculpted marble statues in the likeness of gods, and pillars that had harmoniously blended curved lines and straight edges. There was also a large, well-landscaped garden that would make you wonder if you can see the end of it even if you walk across it the entire day.In Korea, where people couldn\u2019t live in their own houses even if they saved up their salaries and overtime pays for their entire lives, the scale of this mansion was unimaginable to any new recruit who just got a job in a small-to-medium sized company.\u201cHa, I don\u2019t want to live in a place like this\u2026\u201dWhile looking around my own studio apartment and feeling depressed, character introductions and expository lines began to appear on the screen one after another.\u2605 Leticia: Hey, Hilda! Hilda! Hurry and wake up!Leticia. She immigrated from another country and she\u2019s a faithful servant of the Paltzgraff household. No such word as \u2018betrayal\u2019 existed in her dictionary when it came to the Paltzgraffs.\u2605 Leticia: Hilda! You\u2019re going back to sleep again! Wake up and bring Young Master Adrian his medicine!\u2605 Hilda: I\u2019m already awake.Hilda. Abandoned on the streets and naturally becoming an orphan, she was saved by a priest and sent to the Paltzgraff family as a servant.\u2605 Leticia: Hilda, medicine!\u2605 Hilda: Yes, yes. Older sis Catarina already went.\u2605 Leticia: Don\u2019t even think about passing off your duties to Catarina and just go right now! Goodness, our Young Master Adrian\u2026 I feel so sorry for him. His disease won\u2019t even allow him to go outside that much and he\u2019d have to take medicine for the rest of his life. No matter how chaotic the outside world is nowadays, it\u2019s still such a pity that he can\u2019t be free like his peers.\u2605 Hilda: What do you mean, chaotic?\u2605 Leticia: Didn\u2019t you hear what happened? There\u2019s someone walking around with a knife so blatantly. There\u2019s even rumors that someone was actually stabbed. But why haven\u2019t you gone to Young Master Adrian? Hurry and get up! Can\u2019t you just get up and go?!\u2605 Hilda: Owww. I\u2019ll take it to him already. I\u2019m going, I\u2019m going!As Hilda grumbled, the screen showed a hallway\u2014at the end of it was a large door. It was bright, yet somewhat eerie. With two raps on the door, Hilda\u2019s dialogue came up again.\u2605 Hilda: Young Master, I\u2019ve brought your medicine.\u2605 ???: Come in.Creeeak.\u00a0With a sound that did not match the elegant and expensive mansion, Adrian finally made his appearance. As the count\u2019s successor, he was the main character of the game with the role of a weak young master and the hidden identity of Satan. He was about twenty years old.Compared to his bloody appearance in the introduction, he smiled softly now, his impression completely different.\u2605 Hilda: How are you today, Young Master?\u2605 Adrian: The sun is a bit too bright on my eyes.\u2605 Hilda: I shall close the curtains for you.\u2605 Adrian: You don\u2019t have to. Leave the medicine on the table. Thank you.\u2605 Hilda: No need for thanks, Young Master. Please get well soon. Miss Leticia is very worried about you. Of course, I as well.Adrian currently suffered from numerous chronic diseases apart from his asthma. It wasn\u2019t possible to relieve his pain, let alone heal him with the undeveloped medical practices of this era.Even though she knew that his illness was something that could not be healed, Hilda sincerely wished for his recovery. At this, Adrian smiled softly.He was a character inside a game, but he looked so beautiful that you could practically see the glow of a halo over his head. He looked so pure and innocent that one would never imagine he was a murderer.\u2605 Adrian: Thank you. You may leave now.\u2605 Hilda: Yes, Young Master. Please rest comfortably.Creeeak.\u00a0The moment Hilda left, his angel-like smile vanished. As he walked in front of the table with an expressionless face, he held the medicine pouch and glanced out the window.\u2605 Adrian: Huu\u2026 It\u2019s not easy to move when there\u2019s a lot of eyes around.\u2605 Adrian: But it\u2019s alright. This way, I won\u2019t be suspected of being able to kill someone with this body.He looked dissatisfied with his frail body, but he still seemed to like the benefits that it came with. Considering that the count\u2019s estate was enormous, there were many eyes watching him. It was impossible for Adrian to kill anyone when there were so many who were focused on nursing him.\u201cThis game\u2019s difficulty is called \u2018hell\u2019 for a reason. That\u2019s why it was a flop.\u201dSeveral people needed to be killed, but it took a long time to kill even one.Perhaps at this rate, Satan would grow old and die of age in the body of Adrian that he possessed\u2026 With that thought, I sat back on my chair and controlled Adrian\u2019s actions in the game.After clicking around insincerely, I pulled up the scenario outline on the game\u2019s wiki page on my other screen to read the strategy guide. Then, I looked back at the game with drowsy eyes.Returning after a failed murder attempt, Adrian stood still, deep in thought. I turned the perspective screen around and zoomed in to see his face.\u201cWell\u2026 Aren\u2019t you handsome.\u201dI didn\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019m just plain drunk or if it\u2019s because of the character design, but I couldn\u2019t help but admire his face while looking at it. And I had to admit what was obvious. He had dark, angular eyebrows, neat features, moderately reddish lips, and slanted eyes. He even looked gentle as he smiled.\u201cI should sleep now. I have to go to work tomorrow\u2026\u201dI willed myself to rise to my feet so I could wash up and go to bed, but my body inadvertently felt like heavily soaked cotton, unwilling to move and stuck on the chair. And somehow, even if Adrian was drawn to look as though he was looking back straightforwardly through the screen, it felt like I was having eye contact with a real, living being.I guess\u2026 I drank too much\u2026All of a sudden, I became dizzy as the world around me spun. Regardless of my will, my eyes drew shut like heavy iron and I fell asleep right then.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Koreans do a lot of grinding in games, too. (3)Translated by YonneeI woke up to a massive headache. Ah, shi\u2026 I already know. I should have controlled the number of drinks I had and just went to bed early. This is why people shouldn\u2019t do things they don\u2019t normally do. After stretching out, I rubbed my stiff eyes.What time is it now? I have to go to work.\u201cPhone, my phone\u2026\u201dI habitually reached while stuttering, but when I couldn\u2019t find my phone anywhere, I turned over once and stretched my hands out again. But I\u2019m sure I left my phone here on my bed, and my bed isn\u2019t that big, so I should have normally found it by now.But my phone wasn\u2019t anywhere here. No, it wasn\u2019t that my phone wasn\u2019t here. It\u2019s just that this wasn\u2019t my room.\u201cWhere\u2026 am I?\u201dWhat did I do last night? Where did I fall asleep? Did I stay out overnight? No, I definitely bought some liquor last night and went straight home. Then I played some games.With my mind still groggy, I fumbled through my memories. But then, a white letters popped up in the air.\u300c Level 1. No skills available. \u300d\u300c When Level 5 is reached, the skill of \u2018Perception\u2019 can be used. \u300d\u201cWhat the, have I gone crazy. I\u2019m seeing things, still\u2026\u201dI might still be half asleep. When I shook my head and opened my eyes again, the letters had disappeared, but the room remained unfamiliar. I looked around with bleary eyes.What? Where is this? Did I sleep while playing a VR game or something last night? I need to go to work.But, at that moment\u2014\u00a0Bang, bang, bang.\u00a0Someone was knocking violently at the door.\u201cHey, Hilda! Hilda! Aren\u2019t you getting up yet?!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cHilda! You slept in again! Come out and bring Young Master Adrian\u2019s medicine!\u201dI swear I\u2019ve heard those words somewhere before.But I don\u2019t remember where exactly I heard it\u2026\u201cHilda, you\u2019re just hopeless. Until when will I have to wake you up like this myself?\u201dThe door slammed open and an angry face was revealed. I looked around several times already.It\u2019s not me she\u2019s looking for, someone else\u2026 But there\u2019s no one else here.\u201cHilda? \u2026Me?\u201dBut she\u2019s the maid I saw in the game I played last night. I pointed at myself perplexedly and muttered. Now that I thought about it, the woman who had opened the door and was looking at me pitifully seemed familiar. She wasn\u2019t someone I\u2019ve met before, but someone I\u2019ve seen in a game.\u201cWho else would it be if it\u2019s not you? Stop spewing nonsense and just get up already!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cGosh, take out one functioning person and everyone\u2019s slow like this, hmph! I can\u2019t trust anyone! No one at all!\u201dLeticia? She\u2019s really Leticia. With a uniquely sharp voice, she nagged like that and left through the door once more, slamming it closed.What\u2019s going on? I need to go to work and submit a report today. If I don\u2019t, my section chief\u2019s going to hound me again.Staring at the closed door, I thought blankly.\u201cHilda, did you sleep in again? Miss Leticia\u2019s fuming.\u201dThe door opened once more, and someone else who had a familiar face like Leticia came in. Surprisingly, she also reminded me of the character I saw in the game I played last night. Blankly, my lips moved.\u201cEmi\u2026 Emily?\u201d\u201cWhy are you calling me so awkwardly? Are you sick?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell is this\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re probably not awake from your dreams yet, Hilda. Hurry up and get dressed. If Miss Leticia comes back, you might get in trouble if she sees that you still look like that.\u201dFor a moment she looked at me with a hand on her waist, then she took something out of the closet and threw it on the bed. It was a gray skirt made of moderately thick cotton. There was also an old apron meant to be worn around the waist so that the skirt wouldn\u2019t get dirty. In the game, all the maids wore the same thing.I was gobsmacked. My mouth opened and closed several times as I set the clothes down.\u201cWow, this dream feels so real. It\u2019s very realistic. You said I\u2019m Hilda?\u201d\u201cHilda, just hurry up and get changed\u2026 No, this won\u2019t do. I\u2019ll be the one who\u2019ll bring Young Master Adrian\u2019s medicine.\u201d\u201cI\u2026?\u201dEmily sighed.\u201cYou better not stand out in Miss Leticia\u2019s eyes today. She\u2019s really strict \u2018cause she thinks the servants\u2019 discipline has become lax these days.\u201dShe looked sincerely at me with a worried expression as she said this. Then, she added, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t anger Miss Leticia any more than this,\u201d then closed the door behind her as she left.\u201cWhat? What\u2019s this?\u201dThough I hadn\u2019t gotten past halfway through the game, I can clearly remember that this was the first time in the game that the character \u2018Hilda\u2019 brought Adrian his medicine.\u201cDid I go inside the game?\u201dThat, or I\u2019d gone bonkers\u2026While staring blankly into the air for a moment, I slapped myself.I hit the side of my face to the point that my ear rang, but I still didn\u2019t wake up. And apart from the intense pain and the vivid touch\u2026 There was the sound of the wind whistling through the window accompanied by the chirping of birds perched on a tree.If this was really a dream, that shouldn\u2019t be possible.\u201cReal\u2026? Did\u2026 Did I really go crazy?!\u201dI went into a game\u2014no, not just a game, but a horror game rampant with murders!Why wasn\u2019t it an otome game that\u2019s swarming with handsome guys!Of all things, why did I have to go into a horror game\u2026\u201cAH, log out! Log out!\u201dIf this was really a game, wouldn\u2019t I be able to get out if I log out? Please, just don\u2019t log me out of life.With a trembling hand, I pressed the small menu that I saw in the upper righthand corner of my field of view. Then, the \u2018New Game\u2019 and \u2018Exit\u2019 options emerged in the air.There was no choice to log out.Then, what if I press Exit?Nervous, I pressed the Exit button. But what appeared in front of my eyes next\u2026\u300c You cannot exit the game. \u300dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Koreans do a lot of grinding in games, too. (4)Translated by Yonnee\u201cWow, isn\u2019t this game a prison then?\u201dI sank down on the bed with a plummeting pulse. When I went on my computer, I didn\u2019t know that it\u2019d be like this. Anyway, it didn\u2019t seem like I could choose anything on the officially provided menu.Would I need to choose \u2018New Game\u2019? What if I wouldn\u2019t be allowed to choose that either?I slowly raised a hand to press it, but before I could\u2014\u201cHilda! Why didn\u2019t I hear you come out?! How long do I have to tolerate you?!\u201dThe door slammed open, and once again, I saw an angry Leticia. She looked like she was about to rush in and hit me dozens of times on the back right away. Nervous, I reflexively closed the menu, but it didn\u2019t seem like the menu was visible to the other characters.\u201cYou\u2019re wasting time here and you\u2019re even forgetting to bring the Young Master\u2019s medicine. And you haven\u2019t even changed yet? So you\u2019re going to be like that all day long?

You all haven\u2019t pulled yourselves together!\u201dLeticia disappeared while shouting, and in the meantime, Emily returned from Adrian\u2019s room. She urged me to come with her quickly, so I picked up my clothes and followed her. This reminded me of a time when I was still in either middle school or high school, when the entire class was called to attention. We were spun round and round to death\u2014was that going to happen here, too?With Emily in the lead, we ran out, but I couldn\u2019t help but be filled with awe. A huge and colorful garden reminiscent of the Palace of Versailles was right there. Wow. It\u2019s so much more vivid compared to just seeing it in a cutscene in the game.\u201cWhy are you standing so far away?! Hurry up and come here!\u201d\u201cHilda, Hilda.\u201dEmily poked me on the side with her elbow, and I belatedly noticed the glances coming my way from all sides. I took a small step forward and stood in the back.\u201cThere\u2019s no one to blame! I called you all out here not just because of one person, but it\u2019s because everyone seems\u00a0so\u00a0relaxed these days! Today, I expect everyone to work together and straighten up the garden!\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dAs though it was rehearsed, sighs broke out in unison. Garden cleaning seemed to be like spring cleaning. I mean, with such a humongous garden like this, it seemed like it would take all day to straighten it out even if there were so many people here for the job.\u201cQuiet! You won\u2019t settle down?!\u201dAt Leticia\u2019s scolding, everyone quieted down. She looked ten times more livid than before. Ha, we\u2019re screwed. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d receive disciplinary punishment even once.We\u2019d have to do well from the start the moment it\u2019s ordered so that it\u2019ll be easy\u2026 The more people whined about not wanting to do it, the heavier the amount of work would be.\u201cAre you not going to pull yourselves together?! Take this opportunity to clean up the rear garden together!\u201dLook, see. I\u2019m right.Nevertheless, some\u00a0couldn\u2019t\u00a0pull themselves together and grumbled while picking up their choice of gardening tools, but fortunately by then, Leticia had left after saying that the count had come.If she\u2019s talking about the count, then it\u2019s Adrian\u2019s father. Until the part of the game that I played, the father didn\u2019t make an appearance, so I didn\u2019t know anything about him in detail. I think I read the detailed character introductions in the game\u2019s wiki, but because I was so wasted, I couldn\u2019t remember anything.\u201cHaa, and I had a bad feeling about today.\u201dEven Emily, who figured that this would happen, let out a sigh after being scolded first thing in the morning. I made a furtive glance at her\u2014why does she look so much like a typical NPC?\u2014and picked up a weeding blade used for removing weeds. I went to a place where weeds were abundant, grabbed a bunch, then cut them with the knife.As the weeds were cut off with a distinct sound, it was at that moment\u2014\u300c Gained 1 EXP from removing weeds. \u300dAs the notification flashed, I saw \u2018+1\u2019 flickering in a white, shiny font at the corner of my field of view. Oh? What\u2019s this?\u300c Gained 1 EXP from removing weeds. \u300dAgain, the moment I cut up some weeds, \u2018+1\u2019 flickered in and out. So, by removing two handfuls of weeds, I got two experience points. When I looked closely at the bottom left, I saw an experience bar right there, like the ones in an actual online game. With only those two points, the bar was a little fuller just now.Wow\u2026 It\u2019s no different than an MMORPG. I couldn\u2019t believe that such a realistic game existed. If this game was actually released, it would be a smash hit.What do I get from gaining experience points? Do I get any skills? I looked around and found \u2018Skills\u2019 at the upper righthand corner and pressed it.\u300c Level 1. No available skills \u300d\u300c Level 5. \u2018Perception\u2019 \u300d\u300c Level 10. (Locked) \u300d\u300c Level 15. (Locked) \u300d\u2026\u2026Oh my god, is this real? I can\u2019t believe I can really use skills. If it\u2019s \u2018Perception\u2019, is it like a sensing skill? Should I gun for level 5 first? But can I really use a skill?\u201cGosh, Hilda! You can\u2019t just cut weeds like that! You have to take out the roots, too!\u201d\u201cHuh? Ohh, you\u2019re right.\u201d\u201cThese are weeds so they\u2019ll grow even if you twist them around, and just cutting them wouldn\u2019t make them go away\u2026 But you\u2019re really weird today, you know?\u201dEmily snatched the weeding blade that was just vaguely in my hand, and she stuck it to the ground. Then, effortlessly, she uprooted the weeds that I had cut up poorly.So that\u2019s how you do it\u2026 I took the weeding blade from her, feeling a little embarrassed and awkward. As I was born and raised in the city and have since only been living in apartments or studio buildings, I never had to pull out weeds with my own hands. And in the game, a character would just need to click on them to take them out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Koreans do a lot of grinding in games, too. (5)Translated by Yonnee\u201cSorry, I guess I\u2019m still half-asleep. Here, there and ooover there, I\u2019ll clean everything on my own, so you can just scoot over theeere.\u201d\u201cReally? All of this? It\u2019s too much for just one person to clean up. Aren\u2019t you overdoing it?\u201dEmily asked in surprise as she looked at all the places I pointed at. But rather than a tedious work area, what I saw in my eyes was a bountiful field of EXP.All that EXP\u2019s mine!I shooed away the worried Emily while appeasing her. Then, I gripped the weeding blade.Let\u2019s go ahead and level up first. I\u2019m basically a level up hustler in games anyway. If I reach the highest level in this game, I might even be able to get out of here.\u201cHow did Emily do it a while ago. Kind of like this\u2026\u201dPull on the weeds, chuck the weeding blade near the roots, then heave it up. My technique looked shabby compared to how Emily easily did it. Apart from the roots getting pulled out, a chunk of soil got scooped out as well, but hey, I got rid of the weeds.I was proud to see the bar filling up again. The beauty of an RPG lies within the fruits of labor, and those fruits of labor being leveling up.Alright, let\u2019s just do it.Rolling up my sleeves in earnest, I started pulling out those weeds that were waiting for me. My hands were slow at first, but I gradually picked up the pace\u2014and piles upon piles of weeds stacked up next to me.With how enthusiastic I was, Emily was worried and approached my side. The other servants who happened to pass by saw me and whispered amongst themselves.\u300c Gained 1 EXP from removing weeds. \u300d\u300c Gained 1 EXP from removing weeds. \u300d\u300c Gained 1 EXP from removing weeds. \u300d\u300c Gained 1 EXP from removing weeds. \u300d\u300c Promoted to Level 2. (Title: Insignificant Worker) \u300d\u300c Gained 1 EXP from removing weeds. \u300d\u300c Gained 1 EXP from removing weeds. \u300dAs I pulled out more weeds like crazy, the notification window for EXP updates popped off. At the same time, my EXP bar rose faithfully as well. Good, if I continue doing this, it wouldn\u2019t be long until I get a skill at level 5.I curled down to the ground for more than half a day and tirelessly pulled out weeds, but I was surprisingly fine throughout it all. My mind was my own, but was it because the owner of this body was Hilda, who\u2019s a servant and a manual laborer by nature?My own physical and muscle strength in reality were nothing compared to hers. If I personally worked this hard, everything would hurt instantly.While admiring this body of a natural hard worker, tears brimmed my eyes. I\u2019m not going to just work like a horse here and go back, right? No, I mean, I\u00a0am\u00a0going back, right?While thinking about this and that, I reached level 3. As with any game, the higher the level, the more EXP would be needed to reach the next level. If the EXP needed to reach level 2 was just 100, then the experience needed to get to level 3 was 200.From the player\u2019s perspective, an increase of 100 points wasn\u2019t much, but with me being a mere servant right now, that very difference meant 100 more weeds to be pulled.What about level 4? And level 5?To get one skill, maybe even one week of weed whacking would be enough. I continued to pull out weeds mechanically, but the road ahead became bleak.Was there any other way to get EXP other than with weeds? A daily, weekly, monthly quest or something, or some other type of achievement\u2026\u201cOh my goodness, Hilda! What did you pull out just now!\u201dHearing the shocked voice beside me startled me back to my senses. What I\u2019m pulling out, well it\u2019s an ordinary bundle of weeds.\u300c Gained 5 EXP from pulling out Count Pfalzgraf\u2019s prized kalanchoe. \u300dThe very kind and detailed notification window made me gape at it.Count Pfalzgraf\u2019s\u2026 prized\u2026 kalanchoe\u2026? No, but why was I given only 5 EXP for it? Wasn\u2019t there a problem with the efficiency of this game\u2019s quest system?\u201cSorry, Miss Leticia! Hilda\u2019s feeling very sick today, so\u2026!\u201dShe had already been frantically covering for me since this morning, but poor Emily rushed in and defended me again.\u201cWhat the hell kind of sickness is it. Is something wrong with your head? The Count looks at that kalanchoe every morning, how could you even touch that!\u201d Leticia screeched.\u201cFortunately Hilda pulled it from the roots, so it hasn\u2019t wilted. We can just plant it again! Sp neatly that even the Count won\u2019t notice!\u201dEmily tapped my hand in a hurry as she said that it could be planted again. I pretended to be very scared, placed the kalanchoe back on the ground and gathered the surrounding soil to plant it back in.Nevertheless, the expensive-looking bright pink flower withered and drooped because its roots had been lifted to the fresh outside air.Emily immediately made an excuse again, saying that water would definitely revive it. I was just nervously looking into the air, staring at nothing in particular for another reason.It was planted back in, but that doesn\u2019t mean my 5 EXP\u2019s going to be taken back, right?\u201cIt\u2019s not just the kalanchoe! You pulled out so many other plants that aren\u2019t weeds here!\u201dWhile searching through the mountains of weeds next to mee, Leticia shrieked once more. This time, Emily could only sigh deeply. It\u2019s a lost cause now.Well, there was no notification about retracting the EXP I gained.The gamedev at least has a conscience.

Just this once\u2026 please forgive her!\u201d\u201cHilda\u2019s the one who wasn\u2019t in her right mind all day and wouldn\u2019t even apologize, so why are you the one asking for forgiveness?\u201dLeticia turned to me as she said this, a terrifying glare directed at me. Oh, then if I ask for forgiveness, will you let it slide?\u201cI\u2019m s\u2014\u201d\u201cForget it! I won\u2019t forgive you even if you prostrate on the ground! Just get rid of this mess! The rest as well!\u201dI was about to say sorry already, but the moment I started, she quickly shut me down. Emily also glanced towards me with a sigh, but I continued to stand there without a clear sense of reality.No matter how much \u2018they\u2019 talked to me with human faces, I knew that they weren\u2019t actually human. They were just pixels drawn by someone, and they moved according to data computed with zeroes and ones.The wind brushing against my cheeks and the warm sunlight shining down on me were all so realistic that it\u2019s creepy. But in the end, these were just pixels.That\u2019s why there\u2019s no way she could exert any emotions for them. It was like not feeling sorry for an NPC even if they die.\u2026But I did feel a little apologetic towards Emily.With the gazes of the other servants gradually fading and with Emily\u2019s comforting words, I cleared up the piles of ruined weeds.* * *As a result of running around all day and getting some EXP, I managed to get to level 4. Meanwhile, one thing I learned was that every action I did in this world was ranked according to the level of difficulty, and the appropriate EXP would be given.I got my EXP from manual labor today, but if I\u2019d think about it more broadly, talking and accompanying someone were tasks that could also be converted to EXP.As if I was opening a gacha prize, I got pumped up. If this was a real game, then it\u2019s all the more reason to be excited!\u201cHilda, go back and get some rest.\u201dThe kind-hearted Emily must\u2019ve been greatly disappointed in me, but she took me back to my room nevertheless. Her compassion must be a programmed trait in this character, right? The way she looked at me, too, and even the goodwill she extended to me. Everything.\u201cEmily.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201dEmily turned around and looked back at me. My emotions overtook me, so I belatedly thought up what to say.\u201cI\u2019m sorry about today.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt seems like I just caused you a lot of trouble.\u201dApologizing to an NPC? I scratched my forehead, feeling complicated. As Emily was still looking at me, she smiled tenderly.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. What\u2019s something like this between us. Sleep tight now, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201dAfter saying this, she turned around once more and walked along the corridor. She was an NPC, but she\u2019s really nice.I watched the back of her head until she disappeared. Soon, I opened the door and went in, and I was back in the room I found myself in the moment I opened my eyes. Its size was a bit more than twenty square meters, and it was densely occupied by a small cabinet, a dresser, a bed wide enough for one person, and a desk.When I entered the room, a notification window popped up as though it was waiting.\u300c The daily rewards have arrived. \u300d\u300c Gold +30G \u300dOh, there\u2019s a daily reward, too? When I glanced up, I saw \u2018330G\u2019 floating above next to a gold coin icon. I guess this means I originally already had 300 gold\u2026But at that moment\u2014white letters twinkled in the air along with the sound of a beep.\u300c Losses have been incurred due to the garden being ruined. \u300d\u300c Gold -250G \u300dAnd that very instant, the floating white \u2018330G\u2019 was reduced to \u201880G\u2019.I gaped blankly at the status window. This was the dreadful reality. I got paid chopped liver, and it was exactly the same as my bank account\u2014everything inside would just be eaten up by credit card dues.I can\u2019t believe it. My entire fortune vanished just because I dug up that kalanchoe and a few others. This meant that those few flowers were more expensive than the cost of my labor for an entire day.Will I need to live like this from now on? Trapped in this unfamiliar world, not getting paid properly, and without a smartphone!I don\u2019t know how high the difficulty of the game is, and I can\u2019t level up easily. I have no skills. Earlier, I wondered if I\u2019ll be able to get out of here if I level up fully, but at the rate I leveled up today, I just might be able to get the max level when I\u2019m fifty. No, maybe I can get out of here at like level 10, right?\u201cSeriously, just please let me go home!\u201dI tried pressing here and there on the menu with my eyes on the lookout for a way back. I saw only one \u2018Exit\u2019 button that looked kind of like a logout option.\u201cPlease! I want to go back!\u201dEvery time I pressed the button, a warning window would pop up, saying that it was an action that could not be executed. But without any care for this, I continued to press \u2018Exit\u2019 like crazy.There were some games that had a bug that would get triggered when a deactivated feature got clicked on dozens or even hundreds of times. Every game was bound to have a bug, and it had always been up to the player to discover and use these bugs.\u201cCome one, please work,\u00a0please.\u201dAs though on the verge of crying, I pressed the \u2018Exit\u2019 button, but only a warning window continued to appear. What the, it really won\u2019t work? Then how am I gonna go back home?I still continued to press on \u2018Exit\u2019 with disappointment, but at that moment, my hand slipped.I pressed \u2018New Game\u2019 instead, and unlike before, I didn\u2019t realize until the button shone brightly.Light was emitted from the letters, and its brilliance devoured the dark room.I opened my eyes widely. N-No way.\u201cN\u2026 no\u2026 no\u2026\u201dMy small murmurs diminished in volume. When the bright light shining over my eyes disappeared, the first thing I heard was the sound of bird singing first thing in the morning.Chirp, chirp, chirp.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Koreans do a lot of grinding in games, too. (7)Translated by YonneeWith my mouth gaping wide open, I looked around me. The previously dark room was now filled with the sunny morning light. It\u2019s exactly what I saw when I first woke up inside the game. And when I glanced down, the clothes that had gotten ruined from all the weed pulling were now clean and as good as new.No, it can\u2019t be. No way, no way\u2026As if I was anticipating the number of a lottery draw, I squinted at the EXP bar. It\u2019s all gone.\u201cNo,\u00a0no.\u00a0My\u2026 My EXP\u2014\u201dAll of the EXP I gained from all that hard work to get me to level 4 disappeared\u2026 I was back to level 1, without even the irrelevant title of \u2018Insignificant Worker\u2019.Frustrated and filled with indignation, the moment I heard Leticia\u2019s voice, I collapsed.\u201cHey, Hilda! Hilda! Aren\u2019t you getting up yet?!\u201dThe same words during the morning I arrived at this place, I\u2019m hearing it, hearing it again\u2026\u201cHilda! You slept in again! Come out and bring Young Master Adrian\u2019s medicine!\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m awake.\u201dI answered reflexively at the loud yelling. The angry steps went down the stairs. Unlike the first morning that was no different than a mirage, Leticia opened my room\u2019s door and wasn\u2019t angry this time. Does this mean I won\u2019t have to pull out weeds?I looked at the status window with somewhat exhausted eyes. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I returned to the first morning, but not only the objects were restored, but even my body was in tip-top shape without any tiredness. Though my mental fatigue still remained.I can\u2019t believe I have to spend another day without even being able to sleep\u2026 But the good thing was that all the money I had blown off from that kalanchoe was returned.My entire fortune of 300 gold\u2026 It\u2019s a pitiful amount, but it\u2019s still better than nothing.\u201cHilda!\u201dThinking that Leticia would come up again if I dithered any longer, I rushed down to the kitchen. I knew my way around the mansion a little now because it wasn\u2019t all that long ago that I was playing the game. In the spacious and clean kitchen, the count\u2019s exclusive chefs were preparing breakfast. And Leticia was\u2026\u201cHilda!\u201dShe was nagging at me like a habit. I don\u2019t know if she practiced her vocalization or anything. As I pretended to be apologetic and to reflect on my actions, Leticia only sighed and had a look in her eyes as though I was a lost cause.Clatter.\u00a0She pushed forward a tray with various bowls on it, including a medicine bowl.\u201cHere. Bring this to the Young Master.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cWhy are you so surprised? This is something you always do.\u201dWhy must I be Hilda? Why must I be this Hilda who brings medicine every day to the murderer with a devil within him\u2026 It was mentioned in the game that Adrian occasionally had seizures and had a weak physical strength, to the extent that it was difficult for him to move.But I can\u2019t let my guard down. There\u2019s still a devil inside him. Was there anyone else here who was easier to kill than the servant who was tasked to bring him medicine every day?\u201cGoodness, our Young Master Adrian\u2026 I feel so sorry for him. His disease won\u2019t even allow him to go outside that much and he\u2019d have to take medicine for the rest of his life. No matter how chaotic the outside world is nowadays, it\u2019s still such a pity that he can\u2019t be free like his peers.\u201dLeticia clicked her tongue and shook her head briskly. I asked reflexively.\u201cWhat do you mean, chaotic?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what happened? There\u2019s someone walking around with a knife so blatantly. There\u2019s even rumors that someone was actually stabbed. But why haven\u2019t you gone to Young Master Adrian? Hurry and go!\u201d\u201cAhh, ow ow ow. I got it already. I\u2019m going, I\u2019m going!\u201dIf I wouldn\u2019t go this time and just idle away, I just know she\u2019d grab my ear. I quickly left the kitchen with the tray as though I was making a quick escape. There\u2019s no one I could pass this onto, so I\u2019d have to bring it anyway. If I throw the medicine away somewhere, Leticia\u00a0just\u00a0might strangle me to death.Feeling the tension rising within me, I headed towards the infinitely long corridor that had a spectacular hall at the end of it. Adrian\u2019s room on the fourth floor was a large room, which had the best sunlight coming in and a great view of the south garden.Taking in a stifled breath, I took one step at a time, still thinking of how I could get out of bringing Adrian his medicine.\u201cHu\u2026\u201dMy strides were short and slow, but nevertheless, I reached the fourth in an instant.Adrian\u2019s room.I stopped in front of the large door and gulped dryly. I didn\u2019t dare knock because I knew who it was inside.It was a room where a devil was residing, so even if this side was where the sun shone the best, it was still gloomy and chilly. The walls were white everywhere, but dark energy seemed to creep through the gaps of the door.I-I\u2019m scared.My hands were shaking, and as the tray quivered, so did the bowls. I was just drunk that night and fell asleep like that, but I really never usually played horror games. A-Comms was known for cruel and minor sensitive themes, and at the same time they were also known for making games with great cinematic artistry. Because of this, I avoided their games even more.Some horror game enthusiasts actually pee their pants if they ever played a real escape room with horror elements, but me? Someone who couldn\u2019t even watch horror movies?\u00a0I\u2019m\u00a0in a horror game?I can\u2019t do it. Never ever.If I see a single cutscene in the game happening right before my eyes, I just know that my heart would stop right then.\u201cYoung Master.\u201dI called him with a very small voice. There\u2019s no way that the person inside would answer because I spoke so quietly that even a person next to me wouldn\u2019t be able to hear.\u201cYoung Master, are you there?\u201dThere\u2019s no way that a voice, which was so close to the whisper of a breath, could be heard twice.\u201cIt seems like Young Master had gone out for a walk? Hmm, then there\u2019s no choice\u2026 I\u2019ll just leave the medicine here.\u201dGood. No one answered, right? I asked if you\u2019re inside. Since a servant wasn\u2019t allowed to enter an empty room without the owner\u2019s permission, even if Leticia were to interrogate me later, I have a good enough excuse.Checking around me again if there was anyone watching, I gently placed the tray down in front of the door and ran away.I even got a bonus\u20141 EXP gained from bringing Adrian\u2019s medicine from the kitchen to his door.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Koreans do a lot of grinding in games, too. (8)Translated by YonneeJust like that, three and then four days passed. The punishment of pulling weeds never happened because I made sure to wake up on time everyday, and I only left the medicine tray in front of Adrian\u2019s tray, too. It was nice not having to meet him in person.Every morning after breakfast, us servants had to gather in the hall for a simple assembly (read: Leticia\u2019s sermon), and Adrian\u2019s schedule was also regular and had no deviations, so I was able to avoid him well enough.It didn\u2019t seem to bother him that I was only leaving the tray in front of his door, so it was peaceful. If I had offended the young master, then Leticia would have already keeled me over long before. Nothing terrible happened so far either, nothing like someone dying and nothing like Adrian regaining his demonic power.Since I had tried playing the game myself, the difficulty really was \u2018hell\u2019, so it\u2019s hard to kill someone without being noticed. But on the other hand, this was very good for me. While carrying out the character Hilda\u2019s missions, I could quietly look for a way to return to the real world.Though\u2026 I\u2019ve yet to find a clue in these past few days\u2026I paused for a moment and sighed.

I looked at my pitiful EXP bar with a rather gloomy expression.Back then, I rose to level 4 in just one day from pulling weeds, but after resetting the game, my progress was at a snail\u2019s pace now, perhaps because I lost my motivation. I couldn\u2019t collect a lot of experience points from the repetitive tasks in the dull daily life of a servant, and I quickly got tired of doing things on purpose for accolades.Getting more EXP was easier when taking on the main quest, but this game wasn\u2019t showing me a quest window or anything.I should at least gain a skill. That way, I\u2019d know what kind of skills they were and how they could help me return to the real world. Right now, I\u2019m so low level that even if I look at the skill window, I wouldn\u2019t be able to see what kind of skills were available.Since this was now my reality, I was feeling anxious even when seemingly nothing was happening in my daily life.As I bit my nails, I furtively looked to the side. Aside from voluntarily peeling onions here at the kitchen, there was another reason why I woke up early today.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s Catarina, Emily\u2019s sister.I heard that she was having a hard time peeling onions in the morning. She tried to talk to the other servants to swap tasks last time, but in the end, she had to come back here because she couldn\u2019t find another person willing to take the job.\u201cSister, peeling onions is hard, isn\u2019t it? Give it to me,\u201d I told her.\u201cUh, mmh. Thanks\u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it hard to peel onions like this everyday? I\u2019m asking because I\u2019m worried.\u201dThere was pity in my eyes as I looked at her runny nose.\u201cYeah. It\u2019s really hard to wake up so early in the morning, too\u2026\u201d\u201cI know. I feel sorry for you, Sister, and you even have to cry like this every morning. Mm, it would be nice if there\u2019s someone who could replace you, right?\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019d be great. But the problem is, no one wants to do it.\u201dAnswering lifelessly, she picked up yet another onion, sniffling with her red nose all the while.\u201cUm, then, Sister. Can I do it?\u201d\u201cHuh? You? You said you didn\u2019t want to do it before though.\u201d\u201cThaa\u2026 aat\u2019s because\u2026 I just thought it over, and I think it suits me now. I think the only good time to peel onions is in the morning, isn\u2019t it? See, just like today. I came earlier than you to peel onions. So why don\u2019t we exchange our tasks starting tomorrow?\u201d\u201cWhich task?\u201d\u201cBringing medicine to Young Master Adrian. Why don\u2019t we swap with that?\u201d\u201cReally? Is that okay with you?\u201dHer eyes widened into saucers as she asked back. Certainly, anyone would think this was weird. It\u2019s\u00a0much\u00a0easier to bring Adrian\u2019s medicine than to peel dozens of onions every morning. At least, that would be the case for someone who didn\u2019t know who Adrian really was.\u201cYeah. I really can\u2019t go on knowing that you\u2019re having such a hard time, Sister. I couldn\u2019t sleep at night while thinking that I\u2019m the only one who has it easy. I wake up early anyway and I can peel onions effortlessly, so don\u2019t worry and leave it all to me!\u201dThere! I don\u2019t have to be so nervous every morning! Resisting the urge to jump up in excitement, I waited for Catarina\u2019s answer with eyes sparkling with hope.Catarina opened her lips with a bright expression as though she was about to accept it, but then she looked away and sighed.\u201cNo, we can\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cWhy!\u201dI jumped up, throwing the onion in my hand without realizing it. Catarina looked up in surprise, but I had no time to notice this.\u201cWhy not! Why can\u2019t we do that! Isn\u2019t it hard peeling onions like this? I already said I\u2019ll do this difficult job for you, so why\u2026!\u201d\u201cHilda. Young Master Adrian personally ordered you to do that, so how can we trade our tasks?\u201d\u201cH-Huh?\u201d\u201cI knew it, this won\u2019t work. Young Master Adrian will be very disappointed.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Koreans do a lot of grinding in games, too. (9)Translated by YonneeCatarina sniffled, threw away the onion in her hand and then picked up another one.Meanwhile, I was just confused and flustered by this new information. Adrian personally ordered Hilda for that task? Why? Were the two of them close? I didn\u2019t see any explanation of that in the game.\u201cIt\u2019s time for you to bring him the medicine. Hurry up and go. If you get there late again, they\u2019ll come looking for you.\u201dWhile wiping her nose, she looked towards the exit as a signal. I stood there motionless and out of sorts, and as I always did, I left the kitchen somewhat depressed while holding a tray with a light breakfast and some medicine.I messed up. If Adrian asked for me himself, there\u2019s going to be no way out of this for me unless he dismisses me from the job. I can\u2019t even personally say that I won\u2019t do it anymore.\u201cIf I run into him like this, will I die?\u201dI trudged up the stairs with a gloomy cloud over my head. And when I reached the fourth floor and saw that the door was still tightly shut, I felt a little relieved again. If I just left the tray there and went back, I wouldn\u2019t encounter Adrian.Nothing happened after I\u2019d been doing this for about three or four days, so there shouldn\u2019t be any trouble in the future.There\u2019s no law that a person would\u00a0really, absolutely\u00a0die, right?\u201cYoung Master, are you there?\u201dAs I did for the past few days, I whispered with a small voice, far away from the door.\u201cYou\u2019re not here today, too, right? Or are you still sleeping? I\u2019ll just leave your medicine and breakfast here by the door and leave.\u201dIt was quiet inside, not one peep of an answer. The sound of the wind blowing from this side of the door was louder than my voice, so of course it couldn\u2019t be heard.Yeah, let\u2019s not think about this negatively. I just have to live quietly like this every day. Leaning down, I barely suppressed my heart from pounding out of my chest from all this tension.Tak.\u00a0A very small sound came out when I set the tray down on the floor.But right then, a clear voice suddenly called out to me from the front.\u201cHilda.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDid you call me?\u201dIt was such a soft, gentle voice, as though it would melt into my ears. As I looked up reflexively, my gaze met Adrian\u2019s eyes. My body reacted belatedly with my mouth hanging open and my heart plummeting to the ground.Atop Adrian\u2019s appearance, the devil I had seen in the game\u2019s intro, overlapped.\u201cAhh\u2026 AACK!\u201dClatter! CRASH!I was so taken aback that I plopped on my but and threw the tray, which was now upside down. The glass bowl that was on the tray now lay scattered in pieces on the marble floor, and the liquid inside had oozed out along with six pills that scattered on the floor and rolled away. It was a mess.\u201cI-I apologize, Young Master. I-I was just so surprised.\u201d\u201cHilda, are you alright?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m really sorry.\u201dI hurried over and began to pick up the scattered pieces of glass and put them back on the tray.Adrian\u2026 It\u2019s really Adrian. Oh my god, oh my goodness, how in the world did you know I was here\u2026My jaw was trembling so hard that my teeth started to chatter. I was so shocked that my vision started to spin. What kind of gaze, what kind of expression did he have while looking down from above? To him, I could only look like prey, right?Unfortunately, there was no one else in the hallway right now. What he needed to regain his powers as a devil was to murder people. There was a condition to the murders he needed to commit, and that was to\u00a0not\u00a0be caught.In other words, right here, where there was no other witness, it was the perfect chance to kill this servant who could disappear easily without any consequences.Am I really going to die here? Seriously? Without even finding a clue about how to return to the real world?With such overwhelming fear and trepidation, I wanted to cling onto his leg and beg. I don\u2019t care about anything else, just please don\u2019t kill me! I\u2019ll disappear quietly. I\u2019m not a game character, I\u2019m just a poor player who\u2019s trapped here after buying an A-Comms game!\u201cHilda, calm down.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sor\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m\u2026\u201dPlease.\u00a0Please\u00a0spare me.* * *\u201cHilda, it\u2019s fine. Were you surprised to see me all of a sudden? I\u2019m sorry.\u201dIt was such an uncannily soft, calm voice. He even went down on his knees and gave me a light pat on the back. And as we were like this, I\u2019m sure that he could see the tremors passing through my body and hear how short of breath I was.But at that moment\u2014 familiar white letters popped up in front of me.\u300c Gained 1000 EXP for the first conversation with Adrian. \u300dMy dismal EXP bar suddenly shot up before I could read all the notification windows. 3, 4, 5\u2026 As the bar filled up rapidly, it stopped just a little over level 5.\u300c Skill unlocked! You can now use the skill \u2018Perception\u2019. \u2013 Passive \u300dWhat the, what is this?Even amidst the chaos of meeting Adrian, who just appeared so suddenly, the fact that I shot up to level 5 just made me so terribly depressed. A simple exchange of a few words with Adrian was equivalent to 1,000 EXP, in other words, 1,000 weeds.It\u2019s been a while since the smoke had disappeared, but the moment I recalled my hard-earned imaginary furnace that took me to level 4, I cried.All the weeds I pulled\u2026\u201cHilda?\u201d\u201cI-It\u2019s nothing. Please\u2026 give me a moment.\u201dAt the stinging memory of hard labor that suddenly came to mind, I pressed the inside of my eyes hard.\u201cYou\u2019re crying?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m nwot. It\u2019s just, I peeled some onions before\u2026\u201d\u201cRight. The pills smell like onions.\u201d\u201cI had to pick them up with my hands, I\u2019m s-sorry.\u201dI got so frustrated at rising 3 levels at once that I forgot, but right now, the one in front of me was an outstanding murderer. I quickly went back to picking up the pieces of glass to appear busy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wait, sweet\u2026? As if I was chewing on the grains of sand, there was a sense of incompatibility here.Other than being sweet, was there anything else out there that\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0suit him? He acted harmless like this in front of others, but while he was alone, he showed his true self as a devil. Even while slashing necks\u2014whether it would be horizontally or vertically\u2014he would make such calculations with an angel-like face.Oh my god. Please don\u2019t cut me up vertically. That would be so terrible. Please at least leave my face intact\u2026\u201cO-Of course not. It\u2019s nothing like that. I am a mere servant, so how could the master do something wrong. That\u2019s not possible, sir.\u201d\u201cThen why did you act like that?\u201dGlass-like eyes stared at me. They were so brilliantly clear and transparent, as if those orbs contained sunlight. But once our eyes met, they looked so dangerous as if they would never let go of anything. I felt like a hyena in front of a huge, majestic lion.\u201cHilda?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHis saccharine voice was so soft that it seemed to melt, but to me especially, his voice sounded so sharp as if it could cut my ears. The eyes that looked into mine also seemed to have a distorted look.No, if I do this, I\u2019ll look more suspicious. If he thinks I\u2019m interfering in his business, I\u2019m done for.I finished taking all the glass pieces, my hand a little calmer now. It wasn\u2019t because of Adrian, but I was surprised for a moment because of the broken glass. It\u2019s as if I finally calmed down.\u201cActually, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s for your sake, Young Master.\u201dI said this in a surprisingly clear voice.\u201d\u201cFor me?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just, you know. As people get one year older, doesn\u2019t that mean we lose our time in the morning that could be used for sleeping? We wake up at a fixed time every day, but suddenly, it will be one hour short, and then suddenly again, it\u2019ll be two hours short. Little by little, you\u2019ll find yourself opening your eyes earlier, and next thing you know, you\u2019ll wake up even in the\u00a0middle\u00a0of the night!\u201d\u201c\u2026So?\u201d\u201cI thought about it every morning. Wouldn\u2019t people be able to sleep early at night if they just complete their work much faster in the day\u00a0when\u00a0they get up earlier in the morning? If I live like that, wouldn\u2019t I no longer be a mere servant, but a person who just strives to do a better job? Even so, isn\u2019t the most important and most prominent task of my day to bring medicine to you, Young Master? But I couldn\u2019t move up the schedule because of my poor sleeping habits, sir. Young Master, you\u2019re at the prime of your youth and you\u2019re growing up a lot. So, I started leaving the tray in front of the door so that you don\u2019t have to wake up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026It was a pity that I couldn\u2019t see you, Young Master.\u201dA strong desire to live was directly proportional to how pathetic a person could look.I added that one thing in the end, but fortunately, it didn\u2019t sound like I said that against my will. This was also a test to see how close Hilda and Adrian really were.Huuu. There was no setup like this when I was playing the game. Why are there so many more details in the worldbuilding now? Anyone could see how incomplete it all is here!Currently in a different world, I imagined grabbing the gamedev by the collar and shaking him.\u201cYoung Master, oh, how can I say this. Seeing you every morning is like hearing the sound of birds chirping in the morning. A great beginning to the day, like that!\u201dSo, please spare me.\u201cI\u2019ve felt so bad about it several times whenever I just left the tray behind. The conversations I had with the Young Master were like, um, how can I say this, like the brilliant light during daybreak that brightens the sky\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Hilda. You\u2019re one of the few people who listens to me so well, that\u2019s why I was sad that you just left every time. The one I was talking to just disappeared.\u201dI just spat those words out because I thought that no matter how impersonal their relationship was, Hilda would still have at least talked to him about taking the meds.But it seems like the relationship between these two was much better than I expected? Seeing how much more disappointed Adrian was than I could have predicted, he looked strangely human.Was this really the Adrian who I thought he was?For a moment, I grew suspicious of his normal appearance as a person. But I soon shook my head and came back to my senses.Don\u2019t fall for that look. You know the true face of that devil.\u201cI\u2019m a little relieved that you were as disappointed as I was, Hilda. Now, come in.\u201dPardon? Go in, you say?\u201cYoung master, your medicine fell on the floor. Your meal also got turned upside down. I can\u2019t allow this to go on because I\u2019m the one who\u2019s in charge of your medicine. I\u2019ll go to the kitchen and get some more and hurry back.\u201dAdrian looked at me as I actively expressed my willingness to go this far.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cFine? Oh no, it absolutely isn\u2019t, Young Master. You have to take your medicine on time. I\u2019ll be back soon. I\u2019ll go to the kitchen and\u2026\u201dAnd I don\u2019t have any plans of coming back again.\u201cHilda. You\u2019re strange these days.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIs there something you\u2019re hiding?\u201dThe corners of Adrian\u2019s lips went up. Those eyes glinted with an unknown light, like hell\u2019s inferno.I froze as I was. No matter how big it pretended to be, a hyena was just a hyena in the end. A hyena that would have its chest be pierced through as soon as the lion reveals its teeth\u2026Step by step, he approached.W-Why are you coming closer. What, why.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Koreans do a lot of grinding in games, too.Translated by YonneeI reflexively took a step back. Every time he drew closer, it was like thunder was raging in my heart. And when my back hit the wall, I stopped breathing.\u201cDone, right?\u201dContrary to how I thought he\u2019d surely kill me, he picked up a pill from amongst the scattered shards of glass on the tray, then he popped it into his mouth. He looked down at me calmly as he gulped it down without one sip of water. I couldn\u2019t say anything.\u201cCome in.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI just want to talk like we did before. Are you going to keep standing there like this?\u201dHe stirred my conscience in such a devilish way. The more pitiful and pathetic he pretended to be, the higher my fear soared.\u201cO-Of course not. The Young Master has ordered me after all.\u201dIf I keep being like this, he might kill me just because I\u2019m annoying\u2026Since I couldn\u2019t take another step back anymore, I had no choice but to close my eyes and go in. Adrian watched me walk into his room like a mole crawling into a tiger\u2019s den.As I had seen in the game, the room was quiet and impersonal. I could appreciate how neat and tidy it was, but it gave off a more lonely and empty feeling.The warm sunlight, the refreshing wind, and the sound of the friendly birds\u2019 chirping all died down the moment they seeped through the windows of his room. It was a place where nothing but a few withered pots of plants by the window had the warmth of life.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOur Young Count, who was tough enough to swallow glass shards and dirtied pills at once, had begged me to come into his room, yet now that I was here, he wasn\u2019t saying anything.Are you trying to figure out how to kill me?\u201cUm, what did I used to talk to you about, Young Master?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking that?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I was wondering what kind of conversations you found to be the most fun.\u201dEven I thought it was ridiculous to have \u2018forgotten\u2019 entire conversations with him, so I changed the wording of the question slightly. Adrian sat on the other side, on the bed.\u201cI\u2019m not sure, I\u2019ve never thought of that before.\u201dAs expected, it\u2019s clear that his mind was occupied right now with contemplating how to kill me.Even if he wasn\u2019t thinking of that now, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll kill me someday. If I\u2019m going to be in the same room with him like this, I should at least have a weapon to protect myself.Oh, right. I leveled up earlier and got a skill.Please. God of this game world, o great gamedev. Please, give me a skill that I can fight back with when he rushes in for the kill.I prayed earnestly to myself then pressed the skill window, pretending to shake off some dust.For the first time, a sparkling skill name could be seen in a status window that\u2019s been inactive and full of lock icons until now.\u2018Perception\u2019.Hm, perception\u2026 All my hopes and expectations that swelled up like a balloon quickly popped and turned to dust. It was obvious to anyone that this was a skill that wouldn\u2019t help me in dire situations.But it\u2019s better than nothing. When I sighed out a little bit, I pressed the skill and familiar white letters came up.\u300c The skill of \u2018Perception\u2019 has been activated. It shall remain activated until manually turned off. \u300dI was perplexed at what this was supposed to perceive, but I quickly found the answer.The pounding of my heart suddenly began ringing behind my ears, and red emergency sirens, like a police car\u2019s, suddenly began to light up. The skill seemed to be like a warning in advance for me to avoid something urgently.No way.\u201cHilda, please close the curtains. The light is blinding.\u201d\u201cY-Yes. I\u2019ll do that.\u201dAnd at that exact moment, Adrian lay back down in bed and asked me to do something. To check this, I looked at the emergency sirens and moved away from Adrian\u2014it felt like the vivid red lights were fading. The sound of my heartbeats, too, which was so loud that it felt like my eardrums would burst, also became a little softer.Sure enough, it was also a skill to sense Adrian\u2019s presence. It seemed like it would warn me whenever I got closer to Adrian, but this was going to be a useful skill in the future too if I want to avoid him in advance. But next time I meet him, this function would only be annoying.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cNo need to be thankful, Young Master. Please get well soon. Miss Leticia is very worried about you. Oh, um, of course, me too.\u201d\u201cMm. You may leave now.\u201dI tried to recite the lines I saw in the game from what I can remember of them, but it didn\u2019t sound too bad. Adrian allowed me to leave right away. I, will I really live?I guess he really called me here without any meaning to it. Right, he\u2019d need to kill someone more prominent so that he could level up. What\u2019s the point in killing a maid? It would be the same as pulling out weeds for 1 EXP.Bowing politely, I tried to control the smile that was threatening to lift the corners of my mouth.\u201cYes, Young Master. Please rest comfortably.\u201d\u201cYou have to bring me my medicine tomorrow, Hilda.\u201d\u300c Adrian\u2019s favorability has risen by 1 point. \u300d\u300c Gifts given \u2013 5/5\u2014You can increase a character\u2019s favorability faster by giving gifts. \u300dAnd then at that moment, I paused as I read this unfamiliar content which appeared right before my eyes in the same white letters. I had no choice but to doubt my own eyes.Favorability\u2026? Isn\u2019t this something that could only be seen in otome games?\u201cHilda?\u201d\u201cAck. Yes. Of course. Tomorrow for sure\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d\u300c Adrian\u2019s favorability \u2013 Lv.1 (2/400) \u300dI stared at the words in front of me then glanced alternately between the white letters and Adrian. Then, as I met Adrian\u2019s gaze, his eyes curved into crescent moons.It was a smile of the eyes that could captivate anyone who\u2019d see it, but I closed the door quickly. Chills ran down my spine.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even after working hard for three to four days, my money stayed the same.When I looked to the right, I saw the red emergency siren icon that\u2019s for the passive skill of \u2018perception\u2019. Of course, it was turned off for now.Then, another thing on the right side was a heart shape that I had never seen before meeting Adrian.The status window that appeared near Adrian earlier clearly said \u2018favorability\u2019. And it seemed like the number of gifts that could be given was also limited.When I carefully pressed the heart icon, the same list window\u2014like with the skills\u2014popped up.\u300c Adrian Lv.1??? \u300dHaving more question marks in this list meant that there were more characters I could raise the favorability with for a good relationship. A favorability system in a horror game? The genre doesn\u2019t match!Then, at the bottom was the experience bar that I was more familiar with.The interface looked simple now, but the higher my level and the favorability of other characters, the more new systems could be introduced.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dMaybe I can still wake up from this dream. Would I still be able to wake up from this survival-thriller game and go back to being a normal gamer?However, it felt like this flop game wouldn\u2019t let me go until I\u2019ve achieved a certain goal. Unfortunately, I had a hunch like that.If a player chooses the wrong class in an RPG, they\u2019re going to suffer all throughout the game. If the player chooses to be a warrior, they\u2019ll need to strengthen their weapons and raise their level. If it\u2019s an archer, another archer of a similar level could hit them with an arrow, too, and that\u2019ll be the end. If it\u2019s a mage, they could make ice walls all they want, but if they faint due to mana depletion, it\u2019s also the end.That\u2019s why players try to look through the occupation or class choices before starting a game.In that sense, even from the very beginning of this game, I\u2019ve already failed. Regardless of how high I can level up this character, if I can\u2019t do a class change, it would be better to throw away the character and start over.Due to the nature of this game\u2019s genre, regardless of whether I could raise his favorability later, Adrian might still kill me because, of all things, I\u2019m a maid whose purpose is to serve him. Though I\u2019m a small fry, if a hungry person\u2019s faced with just any kind of food, wouldn\u2019t it still look appetizing to them?Still, there\u2019s hope. I didn\u2019t reach the end of the game, and I was drunk throughout my gameplay so my memory\u2019s a bit woozy in the middle, but I can still remember the people he\u2019s going to kill and what tools he\u2019d use to do the deed.Needless to say, all the characters of this mansion were candidates for murder victims, but the tools that could be used were limited.Besides that, Adrian could hardly use his demonic power at the start of the game, so maybe I could sneakily hide the dangerous tools from the weak young master.There\u2019s nothing to be afraid of if the evil devil can\u2019t gain any strength, right? Rather than running away from everything recklessly, maybe it\u2019s safer to be close to him while preventing him from getting stronger.Aight. Unexpectedly, maybe it\u2019s not going to be that difficult to survive.While looking at the pitch-black ceiling, I took a deep breath.When I first opened my eyes in this game, I was so flustered that I ran away and just screamed all the time. But now, as I organized my thoughts one by one, I could remain calm now.\u300c The daily rewards have arrived. \u300d\u300c Gold +30G \u300dYeah, I don\u2019t have to think so pessimistically. I\u2019ll be able to do anything once I collect my salary every day.After all this, I can even hire a bodyguard! Or, if I save enough, I can even get out of this mansion completely!\u300c Losses have been incurred from breaking the Countess\u2019 plate. \u300d\u300c Gold -300G \u300dAs though laughing at my hopeful thoughts, those white letters quickly popped up and disappeared. I recalled how Adrian suddenly opened the door and made me break the plate. That small thing is 300 gold?The moment my shabby 300 gold had dwindled down to 30 gold, my own inner devil woke up.\u201cThis stupid flop game! This is why no one\u2019s playing this!\u201dI poured all my wrath at the pillow I punched dozens of times while shouting \u2018flop game\u2019.\u300c Damages have been incurred from lowering the pillow\u2019s durability. \u300d\u300c Gold -5G \u300d\u201cAAAAARGH!\u201dWhen my salary\u2019s already at 30 gold per day, I first wondered why I had only 300 gold in total. But after experiencing this for a few days, I realized the reason with such despair.This balance of wealth is sh*t! This place was plastered with only disgustingly pricey things all over, so there\u2019s more chances to lose rather than gain money.At this rate, rather than Adrian killing me, I might just starve to death first.Ha. Should I just try to find out more about class changing?t/n:Class change \u2013 a character can change jobs or raise their job position (kinda like evolving in pokemon). in hilda\u2019s case, she could do a class change by raising her maid status to a \u2018lady-in-waiting\u2019 maybe, or if it\u2019s a complete class change to another occupation like a seamstress or some other job, that might be possible too. (i\u2019m basing this logic from my limited knowledge of rpgs mostly via fire emblem XD i\u2019m not actually sure if the game system here is the same)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if he didn\u2019t act scary, his backstory and role in this game frightened me. And even if he wouldn\u2019t kill me directly, just feeling the threat to my life would eventually shorten my lifespan.Though Adrian was, in many ways, of no help to my life at all in this game, I was jealous of the other servants who think that it\u2019s nice bringing the medicine to him.It\u2019s already so difficult to raise Adrian\u2019s favorability, and even aiming for being his lover would just be like going around in circles rather than solving the problem.Adrian has had a weak body ever since he was young\u2014he still couldn\u2019t regain his power of the devil back then\u2014so, let alone doing his work as the only successor of the family, he had yet to enter high society.I\u2019ve already caught his eye. Since I started my life here as a servant, if I can\u2019t be even the tail of a dragon, I\u2019ll be the head of a snake. I\u2019m just trying to think about it that way.But I\u2019m really not underestimating my opponent. All I want is to survive, I don\u2019t even dream of success or anything like it! This is all really unfair. I couldn\u2019t help but feel so taken aback by this.\u201cYou\u2019ve been bringing medicine for the Young Master these days, so it\u2019s like you can\u2019t see anything else, huh?\u201d\u201cYou\u00a0do\u00a0know it\u2019s\u00a0isn\u2019t\u00a0true that you\u2019re talented enough to be the Young Master\u2019s attendant, hm?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re being so arrogant when you\u2019re not even qualified.\u201dSimilar to a bullying scene in a teen drama, I was dragged to the backyard as soon as I went to the kitchen for my other task, and here I was forced to listen to harsh but not really harsh words.There were about ten people surrounding me, plus their leaders. I pretended to widen my eyes as I turned to look around at them.There were three main leaders\u2014Serena, Louise, and Delores. Their names were written in pixels beside them.\u201cYou\u2019re not worthy!\u201d\u201cHow dare you seduce the Young Master!\u201d\u201cYou need to know your place!\u201d\u201cIf you think you have any weight in the County, you should just go ahead and quit and leave this place! You don\u2019t have any shame, you\u2019re just sticking like a pesky tick!\u201dJust for doing my work as the young master\u2019s attendant who brings his medicine, they\u2019re telling me to leave the mansion. Please, I want that for myself.They gathered the day before and became united as one to fight together. I dunno with you, but I don\u2019t want this either! My body\u2019s all twisted up because of the frustration I\u2019m feeling. I\u2019m the one who wants more than anyone here to get out of this place!\u201cWe\u2019ve heard all these, but you\u2019re still keeping your mouth shut?\u201d\u201cGet out of my way.\u201dFinally, one of the leaders stepped forward. Delores\u2026 She has golden blond hair that seems a bit faded. She\u2019s definitely one of Adrian\u2019s sacrificial victims.Not just her. Everyone here would eventually be Adrian\u2019s victims one day.I suddenly became sad. Everyone\u2019s so full of vigor right now, but unfortunately\u2026\u201cDo you know what people are whispering about behind you?\u201d\u201cHow can I know when they\u2019re all whispering behind me?\u201dSuddenly, Delores\u2019 lips became distorted as if she didn\u2019t know what to answer.\u201cIf you want to serve the Young Master\u2019s medicine so badly, just tell me. Yesterday, I broke all the plates and bowls and dropped the medicine on the floor. Since I made such a mistake, maybe he\u2019ll let you do it. You\u2019re qualified enough, right? I don\u2019t really have any skills either. You all have seen how many times I\u2019ve been scolded by Leticia just from washing dishes.\u201d\u201cW-What?\u201dI expressed my wishes sincerely, but Delores\u2019 face just turned red, perhaps thinking that I was making fun of her. As giggles broke out around us, she yelled.\u201cWhat did you just say! Are you mocking me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not. You know I grew up in a temple when I was young, right? I prayed so hard that I\u2019ve been imbued with the holy spirit. That\u2019s why, sometimes, I see people\u2019s futures.\u201dI said this while recalling Hilda\u2019s character backstory. She had been abandoned by her parents and was left on the streets, until a priest had found her. So, before becoming a maid of the Pfalzgraf family, she had lived in a temple for some time.As I mentioned this, everyone flinched, whether or not they knew this backstory.\u201cGod has spoken to me. In the year 473\u2014so that\u2019s this year\u2014the mansion shall be besieged by demons.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, demons?\u201d\u201cRight. You still can\u2019t understand, but this is not the time for us to fight amongst ourselves. You don\u2019t know it, but we all have one enemy. If you don\u2019t want to die, never go around alone. Yes, especially\u00a0you.\u201dI pointed at Delores, who was standing right in front of me. Who else?\u201cAnd you, and you\u2026 Even you. No\u2014you, too. You should be careful as well.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of nonsense are you spouting right now? Just who do you think you\u2019re fooling here?\u201d\u201cRemember what I\u2019ve said. Even if it\u2019s not a demon, maybe a pot could still fall over your head, right?\u201dPointing towards the pot that was barely hanging on at the railing in a third-floor balcony, Serena quickly moved away from the wall she had been leaning against.The eyes that previously disregarded and looked down on me now suddenly regarded me as though I was a shaman. They didn\u2019t want to believe my words, but they couldn\u2019t just ignore me either.\u201cThen, I need to go and bring the Young Master\u2019s medicine soon, so if you excuse me\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you guys are late, too, you\u2019ll be scolded by Leticia.\u201dAs I turned around after saying this, they all looked at me in disbelief. Their murmurs followed.\u201cWhat the, this girl. Besieged?\u201d\u201cWhat a cowardly excuse just to keep bringing the Young Master\u2019s medicine.\u201d\u201cBut wasn\u2019t Hilda originally a timid kid?\u201dAt a time when I was being called several times a day by a promising serial killer, such a thing like bullying didn\u2019t even faze me.Right there waiting for me was someone who\u2019d make me want to cry even more\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Koreans do a lot of grinding in games, too.Translated by YonneeWith a dark expression, I arranged Adrian\u2019s medicine and meal on the tray. I got used to it, so it took me less than five minutes now. I should go inside Adrian\u2019s room today, right? If I leave the tray in front of his door again, he\u2019d just come out and surprise me again, right? Maybe he\u2019d even say that I went against his order and claim damages for being disrespectful.In reality and in this game as well, a worker\u2019s salary would pass through a bank account, of which the balance would hit the ground, and then the worker would have to open up if the boss told them to. It\u2019s a tearful, vicious cycle.\u201cHilda! Ah, you\u2019re bringing the medicine to the Young Master. Good work. While you\u2019re there, go clean up the Young Master\u2019s room with me.\u201d\u201cHuh? C-Clean? But it\u2019s already spotless.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t even try to make excuses. It\u2019s a mess right now.\u201dLeticia suddenly made a face as she clicked her tongue. What happened?\u201cIt\u2019ll be difficult if it\u2019s just the two of us. Catarina, follow me.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand.\u201dCatarina, who was peeling onions meticulously in one corner of the kitchen, quickly stood up and followed behind Leticia.\u201cWhat are you doing right now? Hurry up and follow.\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201dIt felt like I was grabbed by the collar and lifted up in the air. A companion! It\u2019s a rule that he couldn\u2019t get caught killing someone, so I don\u2019t have to fear for my life today with Adrian.\u201cDid something good happen to you in the morning? Why are you so happy?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s nice to walk together with you, Miss Leticia.\u201dWhen I said this with all my heart, Leticia looked at me as though I was speaking nonsense. But really, I mean it. Thank you for saving me.\u201cGood morning, Alvan.\u201d\u201cGood morning, Leticia. Are you heading towards the Young Master\u2019s bedroom?\u201dLeticia and Alvan, the butler I had encountered in the hallway, greeted each other. Then suddenly, Leticia glanced around and lowered her voice.\u201cThe Madam?\u201d\u201cThe physician came and prescribed a stabilizer. She must have been extremely agitated.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the cause this time?\u201d\u201cIt must have been a dream. About\u00a0that\u00a0day\u2026\u201d\u201cGracious.\u201d\u201cWhen you go up, pretend you don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a mess.\u201dSeeing Leticia be intimidated, Alvan looked away and shook his head slightly. He typically had the image of a benevolent, competent but strict grandpa butler. He soon turned and spoke to me and Catarina.\u201cYou both are going to have a hard time today. You especially, Hilda. I heard that you\u2019ve been diligently in charge of the Young Master\u2019s medicine. Take good care of doing that task. Don\u2019t disappoint.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ye\u2026s.\u201d\u201cYes. You have to lend your strength. I\u2019m so proud to see a child, who used to be so troubled, grow up to be such a gentle young woman. Oh, I\u2019ve been holding you here for too long. Miss Leticia, please go upstairs. It\u2019s time for the Young Master to take his medicine.\u201d\u201cYes, then.\u201dAs Alvan politely stepped out of the way, Leticia politely bowed her head and took the lead. I looked alternately between Leticia and Catarina with a curious gaze. A dream about \u2018that day\u2019? What\u2019s it about? What happened between the countess and her son? You\u2019re supposed to gossip behind the scenes at times like this, right?After passing the hall, we climbed the stairs. Catarina was the first to open her lips.\u201cSo it\u2019s that.\u201d\u201cYes, it seems to be that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cRight?\u201dAs if testing the waters, I drew their attention.\u2026What\u00a0is\u00a0it?\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 that, right?\u201d\u201cSeeing that you reacted like this, Hilda, it really seems to be that.\u201dEven though there were clear question marks behind my eyes, the two just nodded to themselves and said, \u201cAs expected, right?\u201d and \u201cYes, it is.\u201d I\u2019m sad. Why is the world so against me.\u201cThat\u2019s why, our Hilda, you should take care of the Young Master very well.\u201dAm I the only servant in this entire mansion? Why do you all keep telling me to take care of everything? I saw dozens of other servants just this morning clamoring to be next to Adrian.I choked up the moment I recalled my days as a newbie at the office and everyone left their tasks to me.\u201cEven so, I guess you\u2019re praiseworthy this time. Back then, you were such a lost cause. There was nothing you could do\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen you were told to sew something, you\u2019d mess up the fabric. When I told you before to organize the cupboards, you just destroyed all the ceramics.\u201d\u201cIt used to be like that, but you\u2019re amazing now, right? To be honest, Miss Leticia cherishes you a lot, too,\u201d Catarina added.\u201cCherish, what are you saying,\u201d Leticia replied.No matter how much more I hear, this Hilda character seemed to have gotten herself in so much trouble. She caused a lot of ridiculous accidents and became a beggar just to compensate for the damages she caused.I didn\u2019t miss this opportunity. With a slightly discouraged, gloomy face, I spoke.\u201cThen Miss Leticia, wouldn\u2019t it be better to have another servant with you? If I make another mistake in front of the Young Master, I won\u2019t be able to show my face.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s impossible.\u201dI was speaking in such an excited tone, but I was immediately cut off.\u201cTo be honest, the other servants don\u2019t want to work well, they just want to look good in front of the young master. But you\u2019re not like that. I think it\u2019s because you\u2019re older than them, that\u2019s why you\u2019re not scared.\u201dNo. I\u2019m\u00a0really\u00a0scared. The person in the mansion who\u2019s the most afraid of Adrian\u2014if you ask me who it is, I\u2019ll tell you. It\u2019s me.\u201cMy hands are no good, so\u2026\u201dBut we arrived in front of Adrian\u2019s door, so I stopped speaking. Even if I knew that I wouldn\u2019t die here since I was with two other people, it\u2019s still scary. It really was still so frightening that, as soon as I stood in front of the door, the emergency siren began to shine faintly, but it was the crescendo of my pounding heart that made me cower even more.\u201cYoung Master, it\u2019s me, Leticia. I\u2019ll be going in.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dThe moment permission was granted, Leticia held the doorknob and turned it around. I entered the room last after Catarina, and without any time to look at Adrian\u2019s condition, I was left shocked.The silent room was a chaotic mess. Ripped curtains, smashed vases and cups, soaked carpet and ink splattered everywhere\u2026 Nothing in this place was intact. Even if you tell me that a storm had passed through, it was still so unbelievable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yes, I\u2019m not hurt.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. You must have been very shocked.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. As you can see, it\u2019s a lot, so you can go ahead and clean them.\u201dHe ordered us in a gentle, yet dignified tone. It could be said that he was characteristically aristocratic. It was ingrained in him to act in this way.\u201cYes, of course. We\u2019ll clean up quickly.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAt the formal exchange of words, Adrian smiled brilliantly\u2014ominously. At the same time, the emergency sirens rang so loudly that my vision turned red as my heart pounded rapidly. Ah, it\u2019s so distracting.\u201cThe medicine is here, no\u2014here, no, here\u2026 I\u2019ll leave it here, Young Master.\u201dWith the sirens ringing so loudly, I looked for a place to set down the tray. I usually placed it on the table, but since it was turned upside down at the moment, I tried to put it on the bedside table. But that was a wreck, too. Eventually, the only place left was the bed, so I set it down at the bottom edge.Who was it? Who\u2019s responsible for this? I\u2019ll have to call that person here and make them clean this with their own hands.\u201cMy mother, she did this.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dMy heart plummeted to the ground. It wasn\u2019t because of the perception skill\u2014it was really my heart. When he saw my surprised face, Adrian\u2019s eyebrows shot up. The emergency sirens were ringing like crazy, telling me to get away from him right this second.\u201cIt\u2019s because you looked so curious. Were you very surprised?\u201d\u201cN\u2026o. Not one bit.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t leave the tray at the door today.\u201d\u201cYes, yes\u2026 Of course.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great. I thought you\u2019d continue to avoid me.\u201dIt hurts. It hurts because you keep hitting the nail right on its head\u2026Adrian smiled brightly, then he looked back at the book he\u2019d been reading since we came here. Perhaps listening to our conversation, Leticia sneaked up to my side and threatened me with a hushed voice. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about leaving the tray at the door. We\u2019ll talk about this later.\u201dI stood there, on the verge of a nervous breakdown, but suddenly, it felt like I heard a low voice laughing behind me. Doubting my own ears, I turned around, but I could only see Adrian reading with such concentration. This jerk, are you trying to screw with me?\u201cHuu, look at the state of this curtain\u2026 Huuu. My goodness, the chair also got trampled and scratched. This one, gosh, this one has been carefully shipped from across the sea\u2026\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s to this extent, did the Madam get hurt?\u201d Catarina asked.\u201cI heard that the doctor stopped by, so if she was hurt, he would have already treated her. Let\u2019s clean this room up quickly. I have to stop the others from speaking of it.\u201dI think he could still hear everything even when they were whispering quietly, but Adrian pretended not to hear anything and relaxed alone. He didn\u2019t seem to even care a little bit, and he might have looked the same when the room had gotten wrecked like this right in front of him.Come to think of it, it looked natural for him to read books quietly like that. He looked so much like a beautiful, precious young master that no one would ever think he was a devil. Even his long eyelashes exuded elegance. And it was so strange to see the favorability numbers floating above his head and disappearing.I\u2019m wondering. Did he perhaps\u00a0not\u00a0dislike people who acted a bit distant?Originally, there was no such feature of \u2018favorability\u2019 in this game, but I could see it plain and clear in front of my eyes right now. If it all wasn\u2019t exactly the same as the game I knew, wouldn\u2019t Adrian\u2019s character setting be different, too? Maybe he\u2019s not the devil, or maybe he doesn\u2019t get his demonic power through killing people.It was a plausible enough hypothesis.But as I was in deep thought\u2026WEE-OONG WEE-OONG!The constant ringing of the sirens was so irritating. That\u2019s it. I\u2019m going to mute it.\u201cTake the carpet and go downstairs.\u00a0Ha-yah.\u201dWhen I rolled up the stained carpet that looked like a drink was spilled on it, Leticia beckoned me to go out. While I was in the kitchen with the carpet, I found the setting button in the skill window and lowered the volume of the sirens appropriately. Good. This much wouldn\u2019t be loud.\u201cHilda, place the carpet over there. Let\u2019s wash it together later.\u201dCatarina said this as she followed. Seeing that there was a crackling sound as the carpet was moved, some shards of glass seemed to have gotten stuck in it. Ah, now\u2019s a good time to talk.After setting down the carpet on the floor, dragging it up and hanging it on the wall, I hurriedly approached Catarina. She was carefully checking whether the plates and teacups she brought with her were cracked anywhere, separately filtering out some fragments of glass.\u201cUm, Older Sis. You know, in Young Master Adrian\u2019s room. What happened?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? We talked about it before already.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t. Apart from that\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, that. What happened fourteen years ago.\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m asking about that. How is it related to what happened to the Young Master\u2019s room?\u201dThere wasn\u2019t a backstory like this in the game. Or maybe I just don\u2019t know about it because I didn\u2019t get to reach the part where the countess comes out? I shouldn\u2019t have slept while thinking about going to work the next day. I should have just played the game until the end.\u201cWhat the, Hilda, you don\u2019t remember? The mansion was turned upside down for quite a while, but you really don\u2019t remember?\u201d\u201cMmh. Actually, it\u2019s like that. You heard what Miss Leticia said earlier, my head\u2019s no good. I guess I forgot about it.\u201d\u201cWow, I can\u2019t believe it\u2026\u201d\u201cSo what happened?\u201dI eagerly asked Catarina, who was still at a loss for words. Biting her lower lip with a frustrated expression on her face, Catarina soon gave up and sighed. Then, she soon opened her lips with a gloomy look.\u201cYoung Master Adrian is the household\u2019s precious son. The Madam was already weak because she had a miscarriage once, so she was so happy to be pregnant once more after such a hard time\u2026 Miss Leticia often says that she couldn\u2019t forget the Madam\u2019s happy expression at that time. Since Milord was so busy, the Madam was almost entirely in charge of raising the Young Master, but even so, she was so happy. That is, until she tried to hold a baptism for the Young Master.\u201d\u201cBap\u2026 tism?\u201dI hiccupped in surprise.\u201cYeah. It happened during the Young Master\u2019s sixth birthday. The Madam invited a priest to baptize him as a surprise gift.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Madam took it and splashed some on the Young Master, and that\u2019s where this whole mess started. The Madam said that the Young Master\u2019s skin burned where the holy water touched, and she kept saying that it was clear that the devil was within him. But if that\u2019s the case, there should have been someone else who also saw it.\u201d\u201cH-Huuuh\u2026 A devil?\u201d\u201cI know right? Devils don\u2019t exist in this world. If the Young Master really was one, why are all the people in this mansion still fine? Something should have already happened. I was scared at first because the Madam shouted so loudly that the Young Master was the devil, but now everything just thinks she\u2019s gone off her rocker. Back then only a few people stayed to work.\u201d\u201cWhat about the rest? Did they quit?\u201d\u201cThey quit and suddenly disappeared. Well, you know. There\u2019s a lot of workers out there who run away when things get tough. There\u2019s no reason for us to look for such people either.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSince then, the Madam has mostly stayed in her room because of her anxiety. She keeps muttering to herself, but you know, when I listen to some of it, chills go up my spine. That\u2019s why if there comes a time that you need to attend to the Madam, just pretend you can\u2019t hear her and come out after you\u2019re done with work. If you happen to mention the Young Master even a little, she\u2019ll get agitated again.\u201d\u201cThen today, in the Young Master\u2019s room\u2026\u201d\u201cWhile no one was around her, the Madam went to the Young Master\u2019s room. I\u2019m sure she made a fuss there and shouted at him that he was the devil. When this happens, everyone\u2019s shushed. There\u2019s nothing good about leaking out the fact that the Madam isn\u2019t in her right mind.\u201d\u201cWait, so only a few people know about it now? You, Miss Leticia, me, Emily\u2026 Who else?\u201d\u201cUm, the Count, the Madam herself, the butler Alvan, Delores\u2026 only those people I think?\u201dFor a moment, I tried to place myself in Adrian\u2019s shoes. Adrian\u2014a literal devil\u2014would have been put on the spot during that baptism, and it was common sense that his constitution wouldn\u2019t agree with holy water. What would Adrian do if these things would be used as evidence to reveal his true identity?Wouldn\u2019t the first people he\u2019d kill\u2026 the ones who knew the truth?\u201cWait, Older Sis. Did you come out of the room alone?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s left in that room right now?\u201dWhen I asked her urgently, Catarina\u2019s eyes grew bigger.\u201cOh, it must be just the Young Master and Miss Leticia. No one else is going to visit the Young Master\u2019s room.\u201d\u201cOh my god!\u201d\u201cWhy are you so shocked? Are you afraid that the Madam\u2019s there? Even if you worry about that\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t have time to explain. I shook off Catarina\u2019s hand and ran straight out of the kitchen. I was relieved that Catarina left with me when I left the room earlier, but as I was busy trying to figure out the story she told me, I forgot who was left with Adrian.\u2018You can\u2019t be dead. Oh my god. Oh Jesus Christ.\u2019As I climbed the stairs two or three steps at a time, I could barely catch my breath. I ran all the way up to the fourth floor without taking a breather. The emergency siren icon, which had stayed silent as I went down to the kitchen, now began to glow with a red light once more.Bang!\u00a0As soon as I arrived at the door, I grabbed the knob without hesitating and threw the door open. Leticia was sitting with her back facing me now as she was folding the ripped curtains. And\u2026Adrian was looming right behind her.\u201cMiss Leticia!\u201dThe moment I yelled, Adrian paused for a moment. When Leticia turned around, Adrian already hid his hand behind his back. Trying not to look at him, who slowly straightened his posture, I tried to slow down my breathing.\u201cE-Excuse, me. Miss Leticia, please, with me, come\u2026 Please come with me to the kitchen.\u201d\u201cWhy? Did something happen in the kitchen? I need to clean up a little more here.\u201dLeticia turned back to the thick curtains in front of her and started folding them again. Feeling restless, I bit my lips.\u201cUrgent! It\u2019s really urgent. We have to go. Now.\u201d\u201cRight now?\u201d\u201cRight now! Hurry!\u201dWhen I stomped my feet and shouted again, Leticia sighed heavily. At this rate, trouble would befall this mansion if I let this slip even once\u2026 Leticia continued to mutter like that, but as she was about to get up, she found a shadow over her.\u201cOh my, Young Master. When did you get up from the bed?\u201d\u201cA little while ago. I was going to help you because it looks hard folding the curtains.\u201dAdrian took a step back. While I was staring at him, my nerves shooting through the sky, Leticia seemed to be so moved to tears at what he said.\u201cHow is it possible for the Young Master to have such a lovely heart? Please don\u2019t worry. The Madam will soon be herself again as she\u2019s being treated by a marvelous doctor. Do you remember? The Madam cared very much about you, Young Master. It would be wonderful if there\u2019s a chance for you to take a walk in the garden again\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, yeees. That\u2019s right. Ahaha, I remember that, too, Miss Leticia.\u201dAs I tried to hurry along Leticia\u2019s words, Adrian\u2019s gaze turned to me right then. Slowly, every time he looked at me slowly like this, it felt like a fire was gradually rising. In front of a predator, I shrank back as if I was his prey being backed into a corner. All that\u2019s on my mind at this moment was\u00a0I want to get out of this room right this second.\u201cHaha, ha. Those were the good old days, but\u2026 Miss Leticia, hurry!\u201d\u201cAlright, alright. Really, what\u2019s going on that it\u2019s gotten you so worked up?\u201d\u201cCome on, I\u2019ll carry the curtains!\u201d\u201cGoodness, fine. You\u2019re strong anyway. Young Master, I apologize. As you heard, there\u2019s a commotion in the kitchen, so\u2026 I\u2019ll take a look for a moment and I\u2019ll come back up to continue cleaning.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay, go ahead.\u201d\u201cQuickly, quickly!\u201dI picked up a bunch of curtains and pushed Leticia on her back. At this, she clicked her tongue, but she soon began to walk. Quite literally pushing her out the room, I glanced behind me.Two eyes gleamed in the darkness. Those dangerous orbs seemed to be taking everything in.As soon as our eyes met, I averted my gaze towards my front quickly, as though I\u2019d been burned.My heart was pounding wildly. Even though there was a rule that he couldn\u2019t kill anyone in the presence of multiple people, it felt like this tenacious, sharp killing intent could urge him to pounce at any given moment.I tried to calm myself down as I recalled what I saw when I entered the room a while ago.Leticia, sitting down. Adrian, approaching stealthily.Those two pale hands reaching out were so white that it seemed like he had no blood, and they had been slowly heading towards the woman.I gulped. My throat was exceedingly dry.He was definitely about to reach towards her neck\u2026 You were going to strangle her, weren\u2019t you?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Koreans do a lot of grinding in games, too.Translated by YonneeI was in a hurry to save her, so I made a huge fuss and dragged Leticia away with me. But, the problem was what to do next.Naturally, the kitchen was quiet and peaceful, so no matter how much one would wipe their eyes, the problem I bugged her about so urgently couldn\u2019t be found anywhere.In the kitchen, Catarina was relaxedly looking at the condition of the plates, then she looked up and asked, \u201cOh my, you\u2019re back already?\u201d before she turned back to her task again.\u201cHilda. What did you say was wrong in the kitchen.\u201d\u201cI-It\u2019s, you know.\u201d\u201cHm? Tell me. There must have been a reason why you dragged me out of the Young Master\u2019s room and committed such discourtesy to him. Did a\u00a0mouse\u00a0scuttle by in the kitchen? Is that it?\u201dLeticia\u2019s voice gradually got deeper and deeper. I could almost see a dark energy rising from her entire body\u2014it made me wonder if she was actually the real main character of this horror game.I took several steps back, but I was soon caught by the other maids. I was then sentenced to three days of weed pulling penalty. Actually, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m fully being penalized because when I went down to pull those weeds, she seemed to have ordered a few other people, saying that more hands were needed for the task.It was such a relief.No, wait. What do I mean, relief? Why am I glad?I was entirely beside myself in agony. Really, if I thought about this simply, these people were all just dots and pixels, even if they died. They held no warmth within them, and they acted only according to their programming.They\u2019re not actually alive, so even if they \u2018die\u2019, they\u2019ll come back alive if only I press \u2018New Game\u2019. There was no need for me to be empathetic and save them. I think\u00a0I\u2019m\u00a0the only one who won\u2019t come back to life if I die in this game.Seriously, I can\u2019t believe I saved Leticia so obviously and blatantly like that. Adrian\u2019s eyes towards me\u2026 When I think about it now, it\u2019s amazing that I didn\u2019t faint in front of him.I knew it. I\u2019m sure I got caught. What I did was practically getting a shovel, digging on the ground and tucking myself in my own grave, right?Was getting out of this game too lofty a goal? It was hard enough just to\u00a0survive.\u201cHaa, let\u2019s stop thinking and call it a day.\u201dThe sun shall rise once again. Tomorrow\u2019s me, I\u2019ll leave it to you to deal with Adrian.I comforted myself as I returned to my room. Then, just as I was about to lie down and rest, the white letters I\u2019d come to love and hate popped up before my severely tired bloodshot eyes.What, why. What now.\u300c The daily rewards have arrived. \u300d\u300c Gold +30G \u300d\u300c The pillow was left unrepaired, and so its durability has been reduced. \u300d\u300c Would you like to visit Anna to have it repaired? \u300dCome to think of it, I remember one message about the pillow I punched last night, about its durability or something. No way, I\u2019m not going. I just know this is going to cost me money. Don\u2019t you dare threaten my life\u2019s savings comprised of a staggering 55 gold.I just stared at the letters, thinking that this game system might have been created after extensively researching how to get me angry and effectively squeeze me dry of my property.If this pillow would get repaired, I just know that the system\u2019s going to charge me like 100 or 200 gold. Ridiculous, right? I already know. I\u2019ve figured you out, game system.Without hesitation, I pressed \u2018No\u2019 and turned the pillow upside down.I don\u2019t know if this pillow had once been beige or white, but right now, it looked yellowish and filthy\u2026 It\u2019s uncomfortable and shabby that you couldn\u2019t really call it a pillow anymore.But then, if this pillow\u2019s durability would also run out, will I have to compensate for the damages again? I doubt this thing could even cost 5 gold.I can pay this much. I\u2019m a working woman who gets paid her wages.But then, the moment I shook the pillow off with a smile on my lips\u2014\u300c Damages have been incurred from lowering the pillow\u2019s durability. \u300d\u300c Gold -5G \u300d\u300c Damages have been incurred from lowering the pillow\u2019s durability. \u300d\u300c Gold -5G \u300d\u300c Damages have been incurred from lowering the pillow\u2019s durability. \u300d\u300c Gold -5G \u300d\u300c Damages have been incurred from lowering the pillow\u2019s durability. \u300d\u300c Gold -5G \u300d\u300c The pillow\u2019s durability has reached zero. Items with zero durability are considered irreparable and thus destroyed. \u300d\u300c Damages have been incurred from the pillow\u2019s destruction. \u300d\u300c Gold -50G \u300d\u300c Your gold is insufficient. The payment has not been processed. \u300dHuh\u2026 This\u2026 What is this\u2026Even before I finished reading each sentence, I got hit with the message that popped up at the bottom, leaving me dazed. Uh, I just tapped it super lightly, but the durability reached zero like that. Then it got destroyed, and the compensation for damages got taken from me again, and all my money vanished and reached zero\u2026 What?Perhaps to make a show out of reaching zero for its durability, the pillow was now torn here and there with cotton sticking out of it.\u201cWhat? Does this even make sense?\u201dThe moment I saw my assets showing a plain and clear \u20180G\u2019, I shrieked. The white letters disappeared like smoke, but the shock that was left with me only increased over time.That shock turned to despair.That despair turned to rage and frustration.\u201cWhy the hell are you doing this to me?! It\u2019s already such a bullshit situation that I got sucked into the game, but\u00a0nothing\u2019s\u00a0going right for me the entire time I\u2019m here!

What did I ever do to deserve going through something like this? I just\u2014!\u201cI just played a horror game while I was drunk\u2026!\u201dIt was so ridiculous just saying it out loud, so it was both funny and sad. My emotions had been bottled up lately, and the destroyed pillow became the trigger.Tears trickled down my cheeks, but dejected laughter slipped out my lips at the same time. And as I was smiling and crying because I couldn\u2019t handle my emotions any longer, those detestable white letters appeared once again.\u300c Damages have been incurred from lowering the pillow\u2019s durability. \u300d\u300c Your gold is insufficient. The payment has not been processed. \u300dMy fist stopped in its tracks, merely one millimeter away from the bed. If even the wind that would blow towards the bed would count as touching, I slowly loosened my fist.That decrepit yellow pillow cost me 50 gold. I couldn\u2019t imagine just how much I\u2019d be charged for the bed.I was angry at the game system, but I was more overcome with the sorrow of losing my gold.Okay. Let\u2019s sleep. Let\u2019s just think about it tomorrow after waking up. If I just get angry at the system, I wouldn\u2019t be able to hold back and let out my screams at the wall. Let\u2019s calm down and just lie down\u2026\u300c You cannot lie down because there is no pillow. \u300d\u201cUUUUGH! THIS CRAZY LITTLE\u2014!\u201dI was about to lie down on the bed, but I suddenly got pushed away by an invisible hand. After stumbling a few steps away from the bed, I tried to come closer again.\u300c You cannot lie down because there is no pillow. \u300d\u201cThis is crazy!\u00a0Crazy!\u00a0Are you really crazy?!\u201d\u300c Damages have been incurred from lowering the bed\u2019s durability. \u300d\u300c Your gold is insufficient.

I can\u2019t lie down because there\u2019s no pillow? There\u2019s so many people in the world who live without pillows!I tried to calm myself down and stop the leg that was kicking the bed recklessly. If the durability of the bed would get any lower, I might really have to pay more. All my thoughts were now dedicated to officially protesting against this shitty rule.I don\u2019t know who I\u2019m protesting against, but in any case, I approached the bed again and opened my lips.\u201cI can sleep without a pillow. Let me lie down.\u201d\u300c You cannot lie down because there is no pillow. \u300d\u201cIf you let me lie down on the bed, I\u2019ll figure out the rest! Just let me\u00a0lie down!\u201dI kept trying to lie down, but after being pushed back about five times, I collapsed to the floor. A mistake. The system wasn\u2019t something that could be persuaded. This is why nobody plays this game\u2014it has absurd settings that only stress out the players\u2026Slumping down against the cabinet, I stared blankly at the torn pillow and dilapidated bed.I should have just had it repaired when I was asked if I wanted to repair it. I had two choices: let myself get robbed, or let myself get robbed\u00a0while\u00a0being able to rest. I\u2019d rather be a well-rested beggar rather than an exhausted beggar\u2026As the night deepened to the tune of regrets and all curse words in the world being muttered under my breath, I couldn\u2019t overcome the drowsiness that gradually rushed in.I didn\u2019t have it in me anymore to stay annoyed, so I pulled my knees close and rested my forehead there, dozing off. When I fell into a deeper slumber, my head would hit the cabinet so I woke up. I fell asleep once more, stumbled, woke up again.I really just wanted to sleep, so I tried to use my arm as a pillow, or I rolled up a few of my clothes and tried to use them as a replacement for my pillow, but I kept being stubbornly disturbed by the system, telling me that it was, in fact, not a pillow. Whenever I would get startled awake a few times, the system notification was right there in front of my nose, shamelessly making itself known.\u300c Your fatigue is rapidly increasing. \u300d\u300c Your stamina is decreasing. \u300d\u300c Caution! If you fail to sleep at the right time, you will not be able to work the next day. The daily salary will not be given. \u300dThe system nagged at me and kept telling me to sleep, all kinds of notification messages popping up one after another. As though I had gained an anger management disorder, I teared up again. Do you think I\u2019m not sleeping because I enjoy staying awake?\u201cYou said I can\u2019t lie down because there\u2019s no pillow!\u201dTears of resentment came out. Do you want me to sleep on the floor without a blanket?!Still, the messages about me not being able to get my salary urged me to move, so I tried to get up and force my way to the bed again.But as if laughing at my efforts, that invisible hand continued to push me away\u00a0 and the notification window popped up once again, telling me that I can\u2019t lie down because I don\u2019t have a pillow.Freaking pillow, pillow,\u00a0pillow!\u00a0Goddamn, goddamn it\u2026I cried tears of sorrow and frustration at the same time, going back to crouch against the cabinet and trying to sleep. My butt soon became sore because of the cold, hard wooden floor.As I grumbled for a very long time, \u2018It hurts, what kind of damn game is this,\u2019 I soon fell asleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And I lost even that.\u201cYoung Master Adrian suddenly vomited blood at dawn. The doctor came and asked if he hadn\u2019t been taking his medicine regularly these days. But that\u2019s not the case, right? You\u2019ve been delivering his medicine every morning at the same hour, right?\u201d\u201cO-Of course.\u201dAs I nodded my head, I felt my conscience being stabbed at. It\u2019s true that I did give the medicine to him at the same hour. But since I only left the tray in front of his room and ran away, I wouldn\u2019t know if he really drank it or just threw it out\u2026\u201cRight? I knew it. I told the doctor that that couldn\u2019t be the case because Miss Leticia was about to come and scold you again. Hilda, are you feeling sick? Why were you sleeping on the floor?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t have a pillow\u2026\u201dAs I answered her, I got choked up again. I couldn\u2019t believe I was forced to be\u00a0this\u00a0exhausted just because of a stupid reason. Apart from that, no matter how much of a game character I was right now, I just couldn\u2019t get in line with not being able to sleep just because there\u2019s no pillow.\u201cGoodness. So you can\u2019t sleep without a pillow. I was like that too before.\u201dWhether a game, whether a character in it, Emily nodded. You understand? What do you mean, you can\u2019t sleep without a pillow either? If you have a body and if you have a place to lay that body down in, you can just go ahead and lie down and fall asleep! Why is it impossible to sleep without a pillow?!\u2026was what I wanted to say, but I was so tired that I couldn\u2019t even move my tongue.\u201cSince the medicine has already been given to the Young Master, can I have an off day? Emily, let me borrow your pillow. I\u2019ll use it for just a little while, then I\u2019ll give it back to you.\u201d\u201cPoor Hilda. I know you\u2019re tired because you couldn\u2019t sleep last night, but you can\u2019t. Miss Leticia will really blow up this time.\u201d\u201cPlease, just for an hour\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t, Hilda.\u201dEmily was nice, but she seemed to resemble Leticia in her strictness. Haa. Well. It\u2019s not the time to idle away in my room. With my bountiful wealth of 0 gold, I didn\u2019t deserve to rest more than I did two days ago when I still had 300 gold, or a day ago when I still had 25 gold. Then, I\u2019d deserve to rest tomorrow more than today.Seeing my hollow cheeks as I woke up, Emily felt a little sorry for me, but she was like a sharp blade when it came to work. While handing me the weeding blade, she kindly introduced me to the workplace I\u2019ll be in for the next few days.\u201cIt\u2019s here. From this side to that side, I was told that you have to remove the weeds and clean up over here.\u201dLuckily, I knew this place like the back of my hand, more than I do with my own room. The first day I entered the game, I worked my butt off right here.That is, I knew just what kind of traps there were.While clutching the weeding blade tightly, I stared intently at the hot pink flowers that were hiding like trap cards between the weeds. Just thinking about how much gold I lost because of that kalanchoe made me want to shed tears of blood.It would have been better if I could get some kind of warning message before I\u2019d do something wrong, but because the daily rewards came after the day had ended, I wouldn\u2019t know what I had done wrong and just continued to work hard.However, now that I have the wisdom of playing through this game system as much as I had\u2014since I had bitten more than I could chew\u2014I wouldn\u2019t get caught anymore in such an obvious trap. I\u2019m going to get all the EXP and gold that I can today!With a strong determination, I vowed not to lose anything to the game system.Like a soldier going to war to save her country, I gripped the weeding blade resolutely.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Right, let\u2019s keep up the good work!\u201dEmily ran back after saying such a line with such vigor, that line being something that you\u2019d only hear in some sports anime. I looked at her for a moment before I focused right back to my weed-whacking.My goal for today was to reach a decent enough level from the EXP I\u2019ll get! For these few days while I\u2019m safe from Adrian, I should level up and gain some skills.But maybe because I spent last night\u00a0not\u00a0sleeping, I had to shut my eyes a lot whenever I found myself staring blankly into the air. I woke myself up in a hurry and shook my head.If I get caught sleeping in a place like this, I might get kicked out of this mansion and\u00a0really\u00a0become a beggar. Then I\u2019ll be homeless and I\u2019ll die in a ditch somewhere without ever knowing how I could go back to the real world\u2026 That can never happen!\u201cBut I\u2019m so tired\u2026\u201dThe grip I had on the weeding blade loosened slightly. If I could lie down and sleep right now, I might even sell my soul to the devil.As I yawned and hit my stiff neck and shoulders, those white letters popped out as though they\u2019d been waiting for the chance.\u300c Work is not going smoothly because your fatigue is too high. \u300d\u201cHuh? No. No way. Think this over again. I\u2019m not tired though? I\u2019m doing a good job?\u201dI quickly pulled out more weeds, my eyes as wide as saucers. Wow, I barely slept a wink last night, but I\u2019m not tired at all? Hilda\u2019s a natural at manual labor, I guess. While working, my mind becomes so clear, like\u00a0this\u00a0much!As if shouting into the air, I quickly handled the weeding blade. Don\u2019t ever show any openings.

I thought about quitting, but I pushed that notion aside. I couldn\u2019t give up hope that if I just kept trying, my success rate would go up and I\u2019d get more EXP again.\u300c The success rate for weed pulling has reached rock bottom. \u300d\u300c Your daily wage has decreased by 20%. \u300dI worked hard on pulling weeds until the late afternoon, and yet the only thing I got in return was\u2026 nothing. I couldn\u2019t get any EXP and my fatigue had reached the limits.This was all caused by a single pillow. I couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing in despair.\u201cHilda! How could you make the garden like this?!\u201dWhat the system kept spitting out about the success rate failure turned out to be true. Leticia came by after she was done with her work for the day and started nagging me, asking why the garden looked like this. Since I\u2019d been causing one ruckus after another, she seemed to be thinking that I was rebelling.Out of all the crimes out there, the scariest one was the crime of disgrace.\u201cHilda, what\u2019s wrong with you these days? Did you catch a disease that you\u2019ll die from? Or is there something you\u2019re upset about with me?\u201dIn the end, Leticia took my hand and asked me imploringly.Now that I thought about it, it didn\u2019t seem like this game should be categorized as horror.A tragedy. The trashiest tragedy out of all trashy torture-fest tragedies.Nothing big or amazing was happening, but it wasn\u2019t like I gained the talent to deal with something like stopping blood from flowing. I was just going through the motions of bothersome and cumbersome things to do, as if I needed to scratch an itch that I couldn\u2019t reach.If there was some sort of determination not to make this game into a tragedy, how was it that everything somehow got wrecked anyway?\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not doing it on purpose.\u201dI answered honestly. I meant it. I suddenly found myself inside this game and I\u2019m just trying to survive. I never tried to make a mess out of things. That\u2019s why it\u2019s all the more unfair.\u201cHuu. Okay. I know you\u2019re not like that. You\u2019re not an ill-tempered kid, and\u2026 things just didn\u2019t work out for you, I guess.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay. I\u2019ll finish cleaning up here, so go up and rest. Oh, but I have a favor to ask you before you go back to your room.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Koreans do a lot of grinding in games, too.Translated by YonneeI nodded, feeling apologetic about leaving the clean-up to her. I was a little tired, but it wasn\u2019t to the point that I couldn\u2019t do a simple task she\u2019d ask me to do.\u201cYou already know about the mess that happened at dawn, right? The Young Master\u2019s duvet got dirty and I had it washed. It must be dry by now, so go and put it back on the Young Master\u2019s bed.\u201d\u201cAt this late hour? He must be resting. Maybe he\u2019s already asleep.\u201d\u201cThe Young Master said he\u2019d be at his study until late tonight. His room has been empty all day, and it should be like that until now.\u201d\u201cAlright then, I\u2019ll do as you say.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t so difficult as long as Adrian\u2019s not in the room. I rolled up the dried sheets that were laid out under the sun the whole afternoon, then went up to the fourth floor with the duvet in my arms.As dinnertime approached, this was the busiest time of the day for the servants. The count, the countess and Adrian always ate separately, so the amount of food and the dishes prepared for each meal was a lot more compared to a single table setting where three people would eat together. That\u2019s why now was the time when each servant had things to do and had no interest in each other\u2019s business.I climbed the steps quietly as I heard the serving carts rattling and moving hastily. Adrian should be eating now, too, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll bump into him in his room. Oh, thank god. If he noticed how I wrenched away Leticia earlier in the day, I don\u2019t want to imagine what he\u2019d do to me while we\u2019re alone.\u201cYoung Master?\u201dI glanced around the room, sticking my head through the slightly opened door. Fortunately, there were three candelabras lit, and none of them moved to indicate any movement.I\u2019ve entered this room a lot of times now, but I couldn\u2019t get used to how dreary and gloomy it is. It\u2019s strange how this room is supposedly the one that\u2019s in the best spot for sunlight to come in.Before Adrian returns, I gotta finish this quickly and make my escape.Feeling a bit spooked, I glanced left and right at the corridor and turned back to look into the room. Finally, I tiptoed in. I changed the bedspread at the speed of light, pulled over the duvet I had set aside for a moment, then arranged the pieces one by one.Just as I saw in a hotel before, I layered the pillows daintily against the headboard and spread out the duvet. Will I be paid for this too during the daily rewards?\u201cAh, stop thinking about idle things. Just run away before Adrian comes.\u201dIf I get caught, I might really die. With this thought in mind, I carried the bedspread that I had removed earlier in my arms. As I was about to turn around, something white and fluffy caught my eye. An invisible hand grabbed my chin and made me \u2018look\u2019.\u201c\u2026Pillow\u2026\u2026\u201dThe word slipped out of my lips as though I was possessed. Of all the pillows I\u2019d ever seen, this large, fluffy pillow looked so mesmerizing that I was salivating even though it\u2019s not something meant to be eaten.Dropping the bedspread to the floor, I approached the bed. And, slowly,\u00a0 I reached out one trembling hand towards the pillow\u2014but then I recoiled in fear.Can I touch it just once? Because it looks really soft.It\u2019s just one touch. What\u2019s wrong with that? Adrian must still be in the middle of his meal.The hand that was recoiled earlier finally reached out fully and touched the pillow. My expression was instantly tinged with amazement.\u201cIt\u2019s out of this world\u2026\u201dIt was so vastly different from my poor yellow pillow. Under my touch, it felt as gentle as an angel\u2019s feather, soft yet durable at the same time. With this kind of durability, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll ever break even after a few punches. I caressed it gently, as though it was a kitten. It was so soft that it felt like my palm would melt.I gave into temptation and leaned my head against the pillow. Then, unable to resist the heavenly sense of satisfaction, I eventually lay down on the bed and covered myself with the duvet.Oh, how comfortable, how warm. It felt like all the fatigue I had accumulated since last night vanished without a trace. If I die now, I will have no regrets\u2026As I let out a deeply satisfied sigh, the white letters that I hadn\u2019t seen for a while blinked in front of me.\u300c Your fa\u2026 tigue\u2026 has\u2026 mode\u2026 \u300dWhat the. What\u2019re you saying?Grumbling inwardly, I squinted at the white letters that were no better than a bully. Why can\u2019t I read the letters? I wasn\u2019t even crying, but my vision was wavering as if there were tears over my eyes. Just to read those blurred letters, I had to really squint and make an effort to understand.Fatigue\u2026 and then what. The rest was like a watercolor painting, but with water spilled over it. What on earth was it trying to say?\u201cFatigue\u2026 stamina\u2026 uh\u2026\u00a0haaaahm, slee\u2026eep, mode\u2026\u201dI literally read it just now, but I couldn\u2019t understand what it meant\u2014as if my consciousness had been completely separated from reality and had gone to a faraway place.I\u2019m sleepy. I\u2019m comfortable. With how sleepy I was, I yawned even in my thoughts. Like the shadow creeping across the wall as illuminated by the candles, my consciousness grew dim.Soon, I closed my eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Koreans do a lot of grinding in games, too.Translated by YonneeAdrian was bored.He\u2019s been bored ever since he opened his eyes in this world.Perhaps it\u2019s even something he\u2019s been feeling since he had been in hell, where he lived countless years before.Adrian Caesar von der Pfalzgraf.Before being reborn into this body, which seemed like it would die with just one measly touch, his name was Satan.The most faithful vassal of the netherworld\u2019s monarch, the sharpest sword, the demonic army\u2019s commander-in-chief.He was the epitome of what a devil should be as he lived in honor. There was no devil out there who would not bow at the mere mention of Satan\u2019s name. Tens upon thousands of demons looked up to him as they bowed at his feet.The monarch he served had a daughter. Born with the blood of royalty, Lilith was born to be a devil. She was the very picture of pure evil, and Satan was quite pleased with her.He loved her as he would his child, cared for her as a disciple, and served her loyally as his future liege.Known as the night itself, as a curse\u2014Lilith, the devil of lust.Perhaps due to her lineage, but everything for her was natural. Her growth was fast, more so her ability to learn and her adeptness with gaining her subordinates\u2019 trust. As she grew up as a devil day by day, her desire to take the throne, too, came early for her.\u201cDaughter, you do not have to start a way. When the time comes, you will take this place naturally instead of being branded as a traitor.\u201d\u201cI shall take the throne that I deserve, old king.\u201dSince then, the netherworld had been thrown into a war that would last for hundreds of years.Those who had something and someone to protect, against those who wanted to win. It was a war between a firm hold over the throne and those who wanted change.Lilith wanted Satan to be on her side, but Satan instead raised his sword in the name of the monarch and swore to punish all those who dared to revolt. Every time they faced each other on the battlefield, Lilith would cry out with resentment against his betrayal.The war did not end easily. Each and every battle that was waged, whether small or large, left a great wound on both sides.As time went by, Lilith grew more resentful of Satan, and every time she faced him, she would spin a curse on him. And finally, when Lilith\u2019s blood had been spilt, the curse came to its completion.\u3010 My teacher and my friend, traitor and the one who leads the enemy. Just as I had lost everything because of you, so too will you lose everything because of me. \u3011Already on death\u2019s door, her lips uttered out a terrible voice. The blood that trickled down to the floor transformed into the devil\u2019s language and spread out.\u3010 You shall be born into a human\u2019s body, considered to be the most inferior, and you will not be able survive lest you eat away their vitality. \u3011\u3010 Endure eternity with those parasites and suck the blood of those pigs. The moment the herd\u2019s watchman finds you, they shall tear you to pieces. \u3011\u3010 At last, you shall meet a natural enemy that you will not be able to kill with your own two hands. \u3011\u3010 And if you are killed, so too will your world come to its end. \u3011The curse crawled over his skin, seeping in like poison, and soon became engraved into his blood.It was a curse made by a devil that had inherited the blood of monarchs, completed with the last of her vitality. Even Satan, who was considered to be one of the strongest of all devils, could not completely nullify the curse. And so, as his body received this curse, he became exiled from the netherworld.Exactly as Lilith had pronounced, Satan lost all his strength and opened his eyes to the body of a human.As he had lived with the strength and body that was incomparable to any devil out there, the frailty of man came to him as a shock.Devils could walk around as soon as they opened their eyes and could also already naturally use their powers, but humans needed to lie down for such a long time even after their birth.He couldn\u2019t speak, he couldn\u2019t stand up, he couldn\u2019t even eat without the help of another human being. When he could finally get up on his own, each step he took was slow and complicated to do. And even if he barely endured that time, it still wasn\u2019t enough.But he persevered. He figured that just as devils would grow up perfectly after six, so too would humans.However no matter how long he waited, this human body never grew stronger. This human skin was so fragile that it was so easy to penetrate, this body was so vulnerable to numerous diseases, and he was prone to falling sick.Rather than getting stronger over the years, rather, he grew even weaker.There was also the matter of a weak mentality. The woman who gave birth to him was so weak that she had gone mad the moment she realized that her son could not be baptized.\u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re more interesting, right? Isn\u2019t it fun that they have weak bodies yet such arrogant souls.\u201dLilith used to be interested in humans. She said that they were interesting and that they were worth observing.As her teacher, Satan took the curiosity of his young student for granted and thought that her interest would soon fade. It was something along the lines of living in the moment. This was because she tended not to be interested in the same thing for a long time.However, Lilith\u2019s curiosity lasted for much longer, to his surprise. Besides that, she spent more time observing the humans rather than the devils. That\u2019s probably why she had cursed him to the body of a human body. Just to make him feel how weak and insignificant he was now.Moreover, Adrian\u2019s body was much weaker than that of a normal human being. If he didn\u2019t take his medicine on time every day, he would vomit blood. If he walked for a long time, he would often lose consciousness.So to speak, if he was a devil and this was his condition, the other devils would have already eaten him as food. But human society wasn\u2019t like that, and thanks to the high peerage of his birth parents, he could even control other humans at will.The humans of this mansion were so deferential that he could recognize the tops of their heads more than their faces.Then, at seven years old.He inadvertently killed one human.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 24": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Surviving as a Maid in a Horror GameCH 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAn unlucky servant tripped and fell down the stairs below. He came across the servant belatedly because no one usually passed by this place, but that servant\u2019s neck had already been twisted. He killed the servant with the book in his hand because the servant was dying too slowly.If there was no hope of living after this anyway, it was another form of mercy to kill someone right away.Then after this, he felt that some of his power from being Satan returned slightly. In particular, it was the power of hypnosis, which he often used against other devils. As this returned, he was able to project his will and commands into the minds of other humans.He finally understood Lilith\u2019s curse to some extent. She meant that he should kill humans to regain his strength, but not to be caught. As a noble who was constantly surrounded by servants, there would not be any other more demanding condition to curse him with.When the corpse was discovered, the house quickly fell into chaos and unease. They were certain that the servant had fallen down the stairs, but they whispered amongst themselves about the suspicious marks on the corpse\u2019s neck.Because the household had a high peerage with the status of a count, rumors soon subsided as though water had been poured over the embers. But still, there were still signs of vigilance. No one wanted to be left alone, and they would always move in groups.Adrian decided to take his time with regard to regaining his strength for the time being. It was necessary for him to lay low so that he wouldn\u2019t be caught by the countess\u2019 occasional accusations. And if anyone would come forward to spray him with holy water, it would be troublesome for him.He then proceeded with his work in a leisurely manner. As a devil, he would have already committed genocide, but he just restrained himself when there were many people around him, and then he would search for prey when their vigilance would come loose.The most appropriate targets were the servants who had come into the mansion not too long ago, so the others wouldn\u2019t find them even if they disappeared, dismissing their behavior as poor work ethic.His strategy was centered on waiting for easy prey, but he would bite down without any hesitation the moment they appeared.Slowly but steadily, he regained his strength. Thus far, five people had \u2018disappeared\u2019 from the mansion, but no one else but he knew that they had died.The reason he could defeat Lilith before was not because of his overwhelming power or resourcefulness\u2014it\u2019s because of the temperance and patience that he had accumulated over the years he had lived. This was his weapon that ordinary devils did not have.Apart from this, his identity as a count household\u2019s young master and his body being this frail was quite advantageous to him. Rather than suspecting him as a cruel murderer, everyone who met him would only feel sorry for him due to his health.The more strength he regained, the more convenient his life became. It was still necessary for him to search for prey and create traps in order to avoid the prying eyes of other humans. If he would ever come into an unavoidable situation, he could at least cover it up through his power of hypnosis.Still, when persuading humans, their sense of survival was beyond his reach. Survival was a human instinct, and his hypnosis could not permeate through this.\u2018What if I just kill these people inside the mansion all at once?\u2019He thought about it many times, but he still needed to interpret Lilith\u2019s curse, and he couldn\u2019t move hastily. He had yet to find any clues leading to who the watchman and the natural enemy were.\u201cThe end of my world, she said.\u201dIt was an interesting notion to consider one more time. He and Lilith used to exchange riddles and ask the other to give the right answer, and Lilith\u2019s final curse was also a similar mystery. It was the dead Lilith\u2019s final gamble. He should at least enjoy it enough.\u201cHm? You must be done, Young Master. Are you not feeling well?\u201dLeticia was the most loyal and the most boisterous human in this mansion. Alvan usually was a man of few words, but he paid close attention to Adrian.Instead of answering, he picked up a piece of meat with his fork and brought it to his mouth.As a matter of fact, as Satan, he had been a great connoisseur. He would mercilessly slay the enemies in front of him, but it was also true that he\u2019d delay entire wars when there was food on the table made by excellent chefs.The only food he ate were the ones that tasted good, but with his condition now, he had to eat to survive. This human body was still, as ever, useless and inadequate.\u201cYoung Master, is something the matter? You don\u2019t look so well. Shall I ask them to cook it again?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOr are you perchance feeling uncomfortable? Would you like me to get you some medicine?\u201dLeticia was quite easy to use, but there were times when she just wouldn\u2019t keep her mouth shut and had to be reprimanded. This was his favorite meal. She was getting in the way.Adrian slowly chewed the meat in his mouth, lowered his fork and knife, then glanced at Leticia.\u2018Get out. Quietly.\u2019Then as though she had lost her will, Leticia stopped all her ministrations, turned around and left the room.Now he\u2019s resorted to hypnotizing someone for such a trivial matter. Having a servant at his beck and call made his life more convenient, but some troublesome things still sprouted here and there.Leticia left the room in a bit of an unnatural manner, but Alvan still filled the wine glass as though nothing had happened.This butler was a very useful human. He wouldn\u2019t open his lips until his master spoke first, and he wouldn\u2019t dare question his master\u2019s actions. There wasn\u2019t yet a time when Alvan needed to be hypnotized.With this in mind, and if he had to consider the future, it might not be a good plan to kill everyone in this mansion.If he\u2019d kill them all, who would cook delicious food for him?When Leticia disappeared, he could enjoy his quiet evening again. Adrian sliced another piece of meat and brought it to his lips. As he did so, he recalled what happened with Leticia a few days ago.Now that he thought about it, there was one maid who was acting strangely.A woman with pale brown hair who came running back to his room just to find Leticia.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s as if she had belatedly realized that she left Leticia alone with him.\u201cE-Excuse, me. Miss Leticia, please, with me, come\u2026 Please come with me to the kitchen.\u201d\u201cWhy? Did something happen in the kitchen? I need to clean up a little more here.\u201d\u201cUrgent! It\u2019s really urgent. We have to go. Now.\u201d\u201cRight now?\u201d\u201cRight now! Hurry!\u201dFrantic, Hilda had stomped her feet as though she was standing over fire. Whenever she felt Adrian\u2019s gaze on her, she would only sneak back a glance at him and tried not to make any eye contact.He could still hypnotize someone without having to look into their eyes anyway. So, Adrian stared at her wordlessly and used his power of hypnosis, just as he usually did.\u2018Look at me.\u2019\u201cMiss Leticia, hurry!\u201dHe hypnotized her just as he did with other humans, but there was no change. If the hypnosis worked properly, then she should have paused and stared back at him with an empty look as if she\u2019s entranced.\u2018Say that you\u2019ll stay in the room.\u2019\u201cCome on, I\u2019ll carry the curtains!\u201dEven when he tried to hypnotize her again, it didn\u2019t work. It\u2019s like all of his suggestions were being warded off by an invisible wall. The maid\u2019s frantic steps grew faster and faster, so it was getting noisy.\u2026Look here.\u201cGoodness, fine. You\u2019re strong anyway. Young Master, I apologize. As you heard, there\u2019s a commotion in the kitchen, so\u2026 I\u2019ll take a look for a moment and I\u2019ll come back up to continue cleaning.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay, go ahead.\u201d\u201cQuickly, quickly!\u201dAs if she was being chased by death, she dragged Leticia out the room, and until the very end, she never made any eye contact with Adrian at all. He tried to hypnotize her one more time before she left, but she didn\u2019t even take one glance behind her.\u201c\u2026Now isn\u2019t this unusual.\u201dAdrian stared at the closed door. What\u2019s unusual wasn\u2019t limited to just his hypnosis not working on her.It was the way she was treating him. Her attitude towards him had become extremely different, so it was inevitable that he\u2019d notice it.If this maid was someone who had just started working at the mansion, he would have taken this in stride and just brushed it off. In a way, he\u2019s someone who could control his own life, and it was warranted that humans would be scared of him.But Hilda was different. This had never happened before for as long as she had been working in the mansion, and it was easy enough for her to do her task of bringing his medicine.Yet right now, she was avoiding him, and any chance that she failed to avoid him, she would flinch and jump frantically as though a devil had appeared from the netherworld.This right here, didn\u2019t it seem like she\u2019d become a completely different person?Did she notice that some of the people who had disappeared from the mansion had died in his hands? No, that couldn\u2019t be the case. He hid his actions very well so that no one could know, but suddenly he\u2019s been caught?That\u2019s ridiculous.On top of that, why wasn\u2019t his hypnosis working on her?She was easy enough to handle in the past, so he never found the need to hypnotize her before this\u2014that\u2019s why it\u2019s also difficult for him to compare since there\u2019s no point of reference.As he thought back to this unsolved puzzle, his appetite gradually declined. Today, the steak that had been so tenderly cooked felt quite tough. Adrian set down his fork, but at this, Alvan was at his side right away.\u201cHave you finished your meal, Young Master?\u201d\u201cMmh.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t eat much.\u201d\u201cClean this up.\u201dAdrian rose from his seat and went straight to his room.He wondered if his hypnotic powers had weakened, but when he used it on a servant who was passing by, it worked without a hitch. Like a puppet hanging from strings, he made the servant walk at will, make a face, and even stand on the windowsill. He couldn\u2019t make the servant jump out the window however.That wouldn\u2019t be fun.He ordered the wobbly servant to go down from the windowsill and made him go on his way again. On a normal day, he would walk along the mansion\u2019s tranquil darkness, head back to his room and listen to an opera record. But because his thoughts were all tangled up, he couldn\u2019t unfurrow his brows either.Did she notice his past murders? Or was she the \u2018natural enemy\u2019 that Lilith referred to in the curse? It was only a guess, but there\u2019s a good chance that this really was the case. The line \u2018will not be able to kill\u2019 could be interpreted as him not being able to use his powers on her.What to do. If she\u2019s his natural enemy, then rather than killing her, he should let her stay by his side. The wisest move here was to end his \u2018world\u2019.But then all Hilda did was to run away from him and flinch at any given time. She didn\u2019t even try to talk to him or stay longer in his room.How could he make such a woman stay still and talk to him?As he reached his door, he was still lost in thought, but it was at this moment that he paused because he suddenly felt someone else\u2019s presence inside. The servants would usually clean the room or change his bedding while he was away, but they always left before it was time for him to return.This had never happened before, but he could clearly feel someone else inside the room that he had previously left empty. It could be surmised that the one staying inside had a different purpose.Had Lilith\u2019s remnants come to him?Heightening his senses, he grabbed the doorknob and twisted it. This situation was something he was displeased with, but if this was a slim chance of regaining his original strength again, it would be possible to drag it out. His hypnosis would also be a great help.Creeeaaak.At last, as soon as the door opened, a loud, unimaginable sound broke out.Zzzzzz.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sure, you have skills now, but nobody ever said you can use them as you please.Translated by YonneeHow comfy. Is this what it feels like when they say your body melts into your bed? I was fast asleep, and I never wanted to wake up. It\u2019s like all the fatigue that had accumulated was gone in an instant because I had a good night\u2019s sleep, without even any dreams.Just how long had it been since I last slept so soundly? Dunno, but it\u2019s clear I never had such a restful slumber ever since I got dragged into this game.\u201cHaaa\u2026\u201dI snuggled into the silky soft duvet around me. There was a crisp scent to it, reminding me of how well it had dried under the sun.I was so happy at this moment that I even let out a languid sigh.Oh how I wish I could sleep in this bed every night. But I can\u2019t, no I can\u2019t.Whose bed was this again? I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve been here, but I really should never because\u2026Mmh? Whose bed?As I was talking to myself, I opened my eyes to this strange train of thought.Whose bed was this?Though I was still in a daze and unable to come up with the right answer, one thing\u2019s clear\u2014that antique ceiling wasn\u2019t the one I was meant to see every morning.What the, where the heck am\u2026\u201cHuk!\u201dI almost had a heart attack right then and there. The moment I turned to the side, my eyes grew wide open.None other than Adrian was sitting\u00a0right there.His armchair was near the bed, and with his chin propped up on the back of his hand, staring quietly at me. I quickly wiped the drool trickling out of my lips and asked calmly.\u201cW-What brings you here, Young Master\u2026\u201dSir, are you filming some horror movie or something?The devil, whose face was only dimly visible in the darkness of the room, made reality feel like a horror movie.\u201cHilda, what brings\u00a0you\u00a0here?\u201dAt first, his voice sounded so gentle, but his cold, emotionless tone made me freeze up. I\u2019m in Adrian\u2019s room right now. I went ahead and fell asleep in his bed\u2026Crazy,\u00a0crazy. All this time, I was in Adrian\u2019s bed?\u201cI\u2019m truly, utterly sorry for this. I\u2019m so ashamed of what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019m\u2026 I don\u2019t know if this would explain the transgression I\u2019ve committed, but I couldn\u2019t sleep last night because I didn\u2019t have a pillow. Working in the garden while I didn\u2019t have a wink of sleep made my fatigue accumulate, so\u2026 I only came to change the sheets, but I fell asleep.\u201dCome to think of it, I wrestled with weeds and desperately struggled against the game system throughout the day. I couldn\u2019t see it now, but I\u2019m definitely filthy with mud. If I slept in this bed while covered in dirt, then, don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u201cHuk\u2026\u201dBecause it\u2019s dark, I couldn\u2019t see clearly. But the spotless sheets and blankets I had prepared earlier were now definitely covered in mud just as I thought.My already bleak future completely turned as dark as the abyss. No. Wrong. There\u2019s not even a chance of recovery here. I\u2019ll die, but even if the medics come in with defibrillators\u2014chief, there\u2019s no hope left for this girl. I wouldn\u2019t even be able to say anything if Adrian decides to kick me out of the mansion on the spot.If he was an ordinary aristocrat, he would have already hit me with the lines of, \u2018A commoner like you,\u2019 \u2018How dare you,\u2019 and \u2018Do you know who I am?\u2019 But rather than that, Adrian just continued staring at me with a penetrating gaze.Some people might think that he\u2019s hypnotizing me with his superpowers or something, but I guess he\u2019s just so angry that he was at a loss for words. Yes. Totally understandable. His pillow was now soaking wet with drool that there was even a mark left\u2026 Oh my gosh. This is humiliating. I\u2019ll turn it upside down while he\u2019s not looking.\u201cI\u2019ve, um, unintentionally made the sheets dirty again, shall I wash the sheets and the pillowcases for you? When do you think you\u2019ll sleep, sir\u2026\u201d\u201cStay still right there, Hilda.\u201d\u201cI-If you don\u2019t want that, w-would you like to switch beds with me? I don\u2019t have a pillow, though\u2026 But it\u2019s at least cleaner than this bed. If the Young Master rests for just a little while, I\u2019ll hurry and clean up here and then fetch you again.\u201d\u201c\u2026It really isn\u2019t working?\u201d\u201cOkay, so you also don\u2019t want that. U-Ummm. What should I do? Should I hit my head?\u201dI could hit my own head for as many times as you want as long as you spare my life. My pride\u2019s a little hurt, but pride won\u2019t keep me alive.I was ready for my punishment any time, but for some reason, Adrian just kept staring at me without saying a word. It seemed like he\u2019ll just continue looking at me like that until there\u2019s a hole in the middle of my forehead.Rather than violently bashing my head against the headboard or something, this reaction was much more burdensome and terrifying. It\u2019s like he\u2019s thinking about how to cook me after killing me!\u201c\u2026Really, it doesn\u2019t work.\u201dHalf disappointed, he turned his head to the side and finally averted his gaze. Was he really trying to drive a hole into my forehead?\u201cNever mind. Leave.\u201d\u201cUh, but the bed\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it myself, so just leave.\u201dIt was a voice rather filled with exhaustion. Even when the heavens had crumbled, there was still a light at the end of the road. Was he really sparing my life here?Instead of jumping for joy, I blinked in surprise. Being a mere maid that I was, I tucked myself into the bed of the young master of a high-ranking noble house, and even slept there, but you\u2019re letting me go?I was going to ask him \u2018Why?\u2019 but you know what, let\u2019s not do that. If he finds the reason for it, he might change his mind and really kill me.I\u2019ll be good and leave when you tell me to leave.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It already plummeted my fatigue, and now it was cutting down my daily wage, too.How much would the young master\u2019s bedspread, duvet and pillow cost me? I have no idea, but I think it\u2019s going to be higher than the 300 gold I had in the beginning.Still, even if the system was going to subtract the compensation for the damages to the expensive bedding, my total balance wouldn\u2019t be able to cover it. I wouldn\u2019t even be able to file for bankruptcy in this place.I had three choices here: to go homeless, starve to death, or become the devil\u2019s meal\u2026My hand rushed to reach for the doorknob just now, but I soon felt miserable.This was how you\u2019d be able to change the mind of a person who\u2019s constantly broke.\u201cI can\u2019t leave just like this, Young Master. Please give me my punishment for making your bed like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026Punishment?\u201dWith a puzzled look, Adrian asked.\u201cBut not any kind of punishment, please. Especially money. I can\u2019t pay a fine. Please also not a cut from my daily wage. Anything but that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou must be wondering why I\u2019m asking for a punishment like this and why I\u2019m talking so much here, Young Master. That I forgot my place, I know that very well. Even as I\u2019m saying this, I couldn\u2019t believe how preposterous I am being. But, Young Master, if you ever witness someone being driven to the edge of a cliff, they might be similar to how I am now. I sincerely hope that you will punish me for making your bed dirty.\u201d\u201cHilda, who is driving you to the edge of a cliff?\u201d\u201cThere is a bully. I am only striving to work hard every single day, sir, but there\u2019s this bully who keeps taking my money for the smallest of reasons.\u201dA damn bully that\u2019s next to me 24/7.\u201cDo you mean that there\u2019s a person like that who comes by often? Here?\u201d\u201cYes. It is a bully that has no conscience by nature, and I can\u2019t get rid of this bully by myself. In any case, Young Master, I will pay for my sins fair and square. If we settle this between us, maybe the bully wouldn\u2019t be particularly stingy today. Probably. Oh, and please keep this a secret from Miss Leticia. I think she\u2019s been having migraines lately, so I heard it\u2019s best to be careful around her.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cEvery one of us in the manor wouldn\u2019t be able to live without the head maid, of course.\u201dBeing at the end of those piercing eyes, my hands trembled, chills ran down my spine and my lips moved on their own as if I\u2019m not on the verge of dying right here, right now.Even a worn out, fatigued beggar could still muster some bravery and still be so determined in the face of death itself.It was at this moment that I noticed something new.\u201cHuu\u2026\u201dBesides Leticia, it seemed like Adrian also had a migraine, seeing that he was leaning back against his seat as he touched his forehead. In full view were his angular jawline, high nose bridge and sparkling eyes\u2026 In terms of looks alone, there was no other visual that could compare.\u201cYou said you can\u2019t give me any money.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. Even if you point a knife to my neck, I still can\u2019t. I\u2019ll give you some if I have it, but I really, truly do not have any money.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a sin that could justify bashing your head in either.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 That\u2019s a bit too much, isn\u2019t it.\u201dI was miffed and I wanted to complain, but I extended my big heart and instead said only this.\u201cThen, just answer me one question.\u201d\u201cPardon? Is that going to be alright with you? The bed, the sheets, and the pillows all look expensive.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an answer that I\u2019ll be able to hear only from you. Instead of that, just answer honestly.\u201d\u201cW-What is it?\u201d\u201cThe reason why you won\u2019t look at me. What is it?\u201dHe knows everything.Well, I mean, it would be even more strange if he didn\u2019t know anything when I\u2019d been avoiding him so blatantly.But why was he curious about that? In the first place, it\u2019s rude for a servant to look into the eyes of a noble, right?It was a cheap price to pay for dirtying his bed, but at the same time, it was also something that\u2019s difficult to answer.Here\u2019s the reason\u2014I knew that Adrian\u2019s a devil who grew stronger for every human being he killed, that\u2019s why I was terrified and frightened out of my mind each moment I was in front of him and wished to run away. But I couldn\u2019t very well say that, huh.\u201cI want an honest answer.\u201dPerhaps because of a wind coming from somewhere, the candlelight flickered and cast a deeper shadow over his face. Pale double eyelids, elegant long lashes\u2026 The very moment I glanced at his face once more, I suddenly thought of something.Though it wasn\u2019t the truth, it\u2019s an\u00a0honest\u00a0reason.\u201cIt\u2019s just, um, because you\u2019re handsome.\u201dAdrian was the main character of this game, and he must have been drawn by the best artist in A-Comms, so I had to admit that his visuals were top tier. Though for someone like me, who knew the truth, it was just uncanny.\u201cI\u2019ve been working here for quite a long time now, but I\u2019ve only recently realized that the Young Master is really handsome. And my taste in men is the weak but beautiful type. At some point, whenever I saw you, my heart started pounding and my hands and legs kept trembling so much that I couldn\u2019t even look straight at you, Young Master.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cReally, don\u2019t you think about it sometimes when you look in the mirror, too? \u2018I\u2019m handsome today as well.\u2019 \u2018How could I be this good-looking?\u2019 \u2018I wonder how it was possible for my parents to give me this face. I\u2019ll have to thank them for the rest of my life,\u2019 like that.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Perhaps he didn\u2019t expect my answer to be like this, Adrian\u2019s eyes widened a little. Then, with one hand, he swept his fringe to the side slightly.\u201cWell, that happens sometimes.\u201d\u201cR-Right? You understand, right? After all, the Young Master looks like a national treasure\u2026\u201dWhat the, I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be like this, but he\u2019s being a total prince-like snob. He didn\u2019t have this kind of setting when I was playing the game\u2026\u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s all.\u201d\u201c\u2026You avoided me because your heart started to pound every time you looked at me?\u201d\u201cYes. My heart starts pounding so loudly that it feels like even my ears would burst from hearing it every time I\u2019m close to you. That\u2019s why I wanted to be as far away as possible. See, I don\u2019t want to die of a heart attack while I\u2019m still so young.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a lie that my heart was racing. Because of the perception skill, whenever I caught sight of Adrian, my heart would start beating like crazy.This was the only answer I could come up with, so will it work? Will this be enough to change the mind of a serial killer?This answer might just put my life in danger though. Having second thoughts, I closed my eyes for a moment then opened them again.Then, the bully that\u2019s next to me 24/7 suddenly popped up at that moment.\u300c Adrian\u2019s favorability has risen by 1 point. \u300d\u300c Adrian\u2019s favorability : Lv.1 (3/400) \u300dNo, wait, what?The unexpected result made me stare blankly for a moment, then I glanced up at Adrian.It was so dark that I couldn\u2019t see him well, and his face was turned to the side a bit, so I couldn\u2019t be too sure. But it looked like there was a small smile on his lips.So, such obvious flattery and buttering up works, too.Goodness me, he\u2019s a devil who likes flattery. Should I take this as a good sign, or should I fall into despair\u2026\u201cNever mind. This time, you can really go now.\u201dNow that Adrian confirmed that he really wouldn\u2019t touch a strand of hair on my head, and in an exchange that validated our mutual recognition of each other, all that\u2019s left for me now was to go back to my room.I should just take a step back now, but in my head, I just know\u2026\u201cBut, Young Master, I have one last thing to say, if you please. It\u2019s about that pillow.\u201d\u201cPillow?\u201dI couldn\u2019t leave it behind.That plump, absolutely lovely pillow that gave me the most heavenly sleep I\u2019ve ever had.\u201cThat pillow with my drool on it, if you\u2019re going to throw it away, would it be alright if you can give it to me instead? You must feel uncomfortable just thinking of sleeping on it.\u201d\u201cBut you said you don\u2019t have any money.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m completely broke. If you search through me and find even 1 gold, you can beat me black and blue.\u201d\u201cBut if I give it to you, you\u2019ll owe me, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat can you give me in return, Hilda?\u201d\u201cWhat will you be requesting?\u201dIf a conversation was heading in this direction, usually I would have already just run away because of the fright.But my obsession with that pillow was what\u2019s keeping me here.Maybe this answer was something he didn\u2019t expect again, so Adrian raised one corner of his lips.\u201cI can\u2019t sleep without six pillows.\u201dWhen I looked back towards the bed, indeed, there were six white, plump, lovely pillows right there. My eyebrows became knitted automatically.There\u2019s someone here who literally can\u2019t sleep at night without even\u00a0one!\u201cUm, well\u2026 No, yes. I see, so that\u2019s the case.\u201d\u201cHilda, can you take the place of that one pillow instead?\u201dHe said so in such a sweet, saccharine voice as the corners of his eyes were curved. It was an eye smile that seemed to have the ability to melt anyone\u2019s heart, but instead, I got goosebumps all over from head to toe.What do you mean, take the place of that pillow?You\u2019ll peel off my skin and turn it into a pillow, is that what you mean?\u201cOh my goodness, Young Master. Something like that surely wouldn\u2019t be comfortable for you when you sleep. It might be better to just cut off the part where my drool spilled.\u201dSuch a terrible thing\u2026\u201cWho knows, I think you could be very warm and soft.\u201d\u201cI truly, whole-heartedly apologize, Young Master. I\u2019ll quietly make myself scarce now.\u201dI was a fool to even try to strike a deal with the devil. He\u2019s nothing but a good-looking psycho, huh?Right, he\u2019s also killed a few people already. I need to pull myself together.Widening the distance between us, I stepped back slowly, quickly opened the door and hurriedly rushed out.I thought I heard a faint chuckle behind me, but I must have imagined it. Just a feeling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sure, you have skills now, but nobody ever said you can use them as you please.Translated by YonneeCrazy, seriously. No matter how tired I was, how could I fall asleep there? I caught the serial killer\u2019s eye even more.On my way back to my room, I beat myself up and tore my hair out of the roots. My plan was to find clues as quietly as possible so that I could get out of this game, but looking back on my actions in the past few days, there\u2019s not one thing that I did covertly.I belatedly realized that the way I spoke and acted in front of Adrian just now would have been far from how Hilda characteristically was. The instinctive grit not to lose anymore money overcame the fear and terror that I should have felt.But the good thing about this all was that, as I returned to my room, I wasn\u2019t charged for the damages to Adrian\u2019s bedding. My remaining 6 gold\u2014which was what\u2019s left from my 80% salary cut for today\u2019s wages\u2014never looked more precious and shiny.If I was also charged for Adrian\u2019s bed, sheets and pillows, even if I worked my entire life with this tiny salary, I\u2019m never gonna financially recover from this.In a different sense, my main goal of getting out of this game as soon as possible was with the mindset of a debtor being chased by loan sharks.Still, what a relief. I talked to the other concerned party and resolved the case.Answering the question of \u2018why won\u2019t you look at me\u2019 was a price all too worth it to pay.Rather, it\u2019s surprising that Adrian was conscious of the fact that I\u2019d been deliberately avoiding his gaze. To Adrian, I should just be something like \u2018Passerby Servant #58\u2019. He had so many people working under him that I was just one of those ordinary servants.\u201cWhatever. I\u2019m beat. Let\u2019s just sleep and wake up the next morning and think about it then.\u201dI had some immaculate sleep in Adrian\u2019s room, but even that wasn\u2019t enough to get rid of all the fatigue that had accumulated. I first took off my mud-laden work clothes and washed them, then I went towards my bed\u2014in a religious and reverential manner\u2014and tried to lie down.But, as if it was waiting for the chance, an invisible hand pushed my back once again.\u300c You cannot lie down because there is no pillow. \u300dAh, right. I forgot about this.These damn white letters were the main culprit of everything that happened.If the letters hadn\u2019t made me angry in the first place, I wouldn\u2019t have punched the pillow and lowered its durability until it broke apart.If it wasn\u2019t for that measly durability, then I wouldn\u2019t have racked up all that fatigue.If it hadn\u2019t been for the fatigue, then I wouldn\u2019t have fallen asleep in Adrian\u2019s room.If I didn\u2019t fall asleep in Adrian\u2019s room, then I wouldn\u2019t have caught his attention.If it wasn\u2019t for catching his attention, then my survival rate wouldn\u2019t have plummeted like this to the point that I\u2019m better off dead by now.If my life ends with \u2018Adrian\u2019s demonic power has recovered by 1 point,\u2019 then this game system was half to blame for it.\u201cYou hear that? If I die here, you\u2019re to blame for more than half the causes!\u201dThe system remained silent and didn\u2019t even bother to reply. I knew it was inanimate, but I cursed at it so much that I might just feel guilty. \u2018It\u2019s all because of you.\u2019 \u2018Do you not have any conscience in you.\u2019 \u2018Are you really saying that I can\u2019t lie down without a pillow when all this is your fault?\u2019 \u2018Slave driver, miscreant employer, swindler, gangster.\u2019 Etcetera, etcetera.Despite feeling a twinge in my conscience, I felt a whole lot better after letting out everything I thought of. Somehow, the system even looked like it calmed down a little, too.\u201cSo can I sleep on the bed now?\u201dAfter all this, you won\u2019t say that I can\u2019t lie down without a pillow again, will you?\u300c You cannot lie down because there is no pillow. \u300dThis system really has no conscience. When I played CCGs\u00b9 before, I used to spend 500,000 won just to get 5-star characters. But here, it\u2019s even more unfair since I couldn\u2019t pick anything\u00a0at all.\u201cWhere can I even get a pillow this late in the night?!\u201dBut if I can\u2019t sleep without a pillow tonight, then my fatigue would just increase again, and when working tomorrow, I don\u2019t know what kind of damages I\u2019ll be charged with\u2014I might just lose my precious 6 gold.Then I wouldn\u2019t be able to buy a pillow because I don\u2019t have money, and I can\u2019t make money because I\u2019m too tired without a pillow\u2026To break this vicious cycle, I\u2019m gonna have to do something about it. Immediately.I woke up the already sleeping Emily and asked where Anna was.\u201cHilda\u2026 You really don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cY-Yeah. I can\u2019t remember clearly. These days, I\u2019ve been having some trouble remembering.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re just really\u2026\u00a0huaaahm.\u201dAfter trying to wake her up for a while now, Emily finally rose from bed, but didn\u2019t seem to have any intention of arguing.\u201cBut why Anna?\u201d\u201cI was wondering if I could buy a pillow from her.\u201dWhen the pillow\u2019s durability dropped the first time, the white letters said, \u2018Would you like to visit Anna to have it repaired?\u2019 So, since she knew how to fix pillows, can\u2019t I buy one from her?\u201cWhat are you talking about, Hilda? Anna doesn\u2019t sell any pillows. Though if your pillow\u2019s seams burst, you can take it to her and get it patched up.\u201d\u201cWhat? Then where can I buy one?\u201d\u201cYou should go to the village and buy it there, of course.\u201dVillage\u2026\u201cThanks for letting me know, Emily. Sorry for waking you up.\u201d\u201cThis is nothing between us.\u201dEmily smiled so brightly that the side of my chest where my heart ached. Emily clearly cared for Hilda very much. Even if it\u2019s left unsaid, I could feel it just by observing her behavior, actions and the gentle look she gave me.But I felt sorry about taking the place of her friend like this\u2026 I mean, I know I didn\u2019t do it on purpose, but\u2026\u201cGood night and sweet dreams, Hilda. I\u2019ll see you again tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYeah, sleep tight.\u201dAs I bid Emily good night and turned around, I felt strangely uncomfortable. It\u2019s not that I wished to be in this position, but it felt to me like I was taking advantage of the goodwill around Hilda, even if it was unintentional.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t think too much about it and just get ahold of a pillow first.\u201dAt this very moment, there\u2019s nothing more important to me.I left the dark manor and headed towards the front gates. The front yard was so wide that I couldn\u2019t see ahead, and I hadn\u2019t even the slightest clue how long I\u2019d have to walk to get to the village, but I marched out straight away without any hesitation.Whether the cause was the fact that I didn\u2019t have a pillow or the fact that I\u2019m out to get one now, I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep either way. At the very least, going out to get one seemed to be less hopeless, so let\u2019s try that.\u00b9 CCG \u2013 \u2018collectible card game\u2019 is the term I settled on, but what Hilda was referring to here was a videogame (not a card game) where the main focus was collecting characters. CCG is just a better-known term, afaik.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The huge iron bars standing tall in front of me felt even more majestic compared to seeing them from a distance. The pointed, well-made bars rose arrogantly high as though they were about to pierce the sky.\u300c You cannot leave the manor. \u300dI tiptoed towards the gate to see if I could get away with it, but the system popped up and blocked my path. Ha, I knew it. I knew you\u2019d stop me. There\u2019s no way this game would ever let me do what I wanted to do.I\u2019m sure this system\u2019s going to tell me to give up on this and just tell me to go out tomorrow, but now. I had no plans of letting it do whatever it wants.I can\u2019t live like this anymore!I walked back to the maids\u2019 quarters much faster than I had walked out.The best thing about being a servant in this mansion was that, despite the large number of employees here, each person was given a solo room. If you\u2019re unlucky, you\u2019d be assigned to a double room, but since there were still many vacant rooms, there were only a few cases like that.However, just as our privacy was well protected, there were still some things that happened around here that shouldn\u2019t happen\u2026While I was still up during the wee hours of the night, I heard a shameful sound through the window, which I usually wouldn\u2019t have heard had I been asleep.\u201cAh, ahngh, AH!\u201dBlatant moans, the wet clapping of flesh, the passionate sound of lips meeting each other\u2026H-Hot\u00a0damn. I was told this was a horror game. I know it\u2019s R-rated because of the game\u2019s brutal scenes, so it shouldn\u2019t be for this, right?I fanned my bright red face and quietly closed the window that I mistakenly left open earlier.Yeah, well. It\u2019s not like this was the Joseon Dynasty, so there shouldn\u2019t be a ban on love. If you keep interacting with the same people inside this mansion, it\u2019s possible to get on each other\u2019s nerves, but it\u2019s also possible to meet secretly at dawn and make love. I do hope Leticia doesn\u2019t find out.This was what I thought and just tried to go back to sleep, but right now, this brief memory was a huge clue for me. While everyone had gone to bed early, there must be some people who\u2019d leave their rooms at night.I left the window open and waited for the right time, like a predator trying to let her prey\u2019s guards down.Tick, tock. Tick, tock. Tick, tock\u2026As time went by, the sound of a passing wind echoed throughout the silence, and gradually, the rendezvous of passion began. Starting with only a little movement, aroused moans leaked through the window.\u201cNngh, ah\u2026 If you touch me like that\u2026\u201dWhen the heated entanglement began, I crept towards my room\u2019s door and stuck my head out to peek out the hallway. It was dark, but I could clearly see that the door of the room at the end was slightly ajar.Over there!Swallowing my hoorays inwardly, I tiptoed across the hallway as if I was walking on thin ice. After all, once they\u2019ve started, the act was rarely finished right away, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get caught. However, as I headed towards the end, I was still careful in case another door might open so suddenly.This room\u2019s owner was so excited to see a certain someone that they even forgot to close the door. I slipped through the opening so as not to make a sound, then\u2014I found the target.It wasn\u2019t as good as Adrian\u2019s, but it was luscious and plump enough that I\u2019d be able to spend a luxurious night tonight.I picked it up quietly and came back to my room, looking out to see if anyone spotted me.As if to prove my perfect crime, the moans from outside the room still went on right now. As much satisfaction as they were probably feeling, I looked down at the object in my hands.\u201cOh, pillow, it\u2019s been such a long time\u2026\u201dFeeling emotional, my lips trembled. I was so happy to be reunited with a pillow that I buried my face in it, nuzzled my cheeks over it and kissed it a few times. I no longer have to suffer from a lack of pillows! I no longer have to be bullied by this stupid game system!I felt apologetic towards the original owner of this pilot, but when things get rough while playing games, it\u2019s often the right move to talk to NPCs\u00b9 for hints, right? Because the existence of an NPC was for the player\u2019s sake, the player should get their help as much as they want to. Even if it was against the NPC\u2019s will.\u201cNow, shall we go to bed?\u201dI couldn\u2019t control my excitement. I swear, my heart hasn\u2019t pounded this much even whenever I caught sight of my first love before.I placed my pillow on the bed reverently and sacredly as if I was serving my god, then, I slowly lied down. There was no invisible hand pushing me away and no white letters saying that I had no pillow. I lay entirely on my back on the bed.\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m lying in bed\u2026!\u201dWhile I was moved to the point of tears, white letters suddenly appeared and flickered in front of my eyes.\u300c You have done an evil act. \u300d\u300c For having no conscience, your title has changed to \u2018Unscrupulous Insignificant Worker\u2019. \u300dThis system had been nagging me to get some sleep, but it seemed to be pointing a finger at me for having no conscience, like saying \u2018How could you steal another person\u2019s pillow?\u2019\u201cWow. Now you\u2019re saying I\u2019m unscrupulous? When you\u2019re the one who told me I can\u2019t lie down when I don\u2019t have a pillow and bothered me with all kinds of excuses?\u201d\u300c Your conscience has vanished without a trace. \u300d\u201cSure, sure. Swear at me all night long. All I need is a good night\u2019s sleep here in my bed.\u201dIf I don\u2019t have a conscience, then so be it. It\u2019s not like anyone\u2019s going to haul me off to the authorities, huh?I grabbed the edge of the pillow and turned it around. The white letters followed me persistently, but I just snorted at it and shut my eyes tightly. I took only a pillow, but it felt like I had the entire world in my hands.Rubbing and burying my face against it, I fully enjoyed the pillow until the last moments I finally slipped into slumber.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sure, you have skills now, but nobody ever said you can use them as you please.Translated by YonneeThis morning, for the first time ever since I was dragged into this game, I woke up refreshed. Oh, how the sun was shining brightly, how the birds were singing wonderfully.The world is so beautiful! I\u2019m so happy! Not even my meager savings of six gold and that conscious-less system would be able to ruin my good mood.\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you in a good mood, Hilda?\u201d\u201cEmily! Good morning! Did you sleep well?\u201dI also greeted the terribly hardworking Emily happily for the first time this morning. Emily wrinkled her nose and smiled in a lovely way.\u201cYup. And I feel much better already just seeing your bright smile in the morning.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I slept so comfortably with my legs stretched out. I guess that\u2019s why.\u201dThough my situation hasn\u2019t improved much\u2014no, well, it\u2019s only getting worse\u2014but I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m feeling so refreshed. I dare to think that my life in this game could be divided into two eras: B.S.P. and A.S.P. Before Stealing a Pillow, and After Stealing a Pillow.With a smile on her lips, Emily added, \u2018I\u2019m glad to hear that,\u2019 then she went on her way.As she descended the stairs, she braided her hair skillfully. When she carried herself in that manner, even the plain gray uniform she had on seemed to look so good on her. Despite her modest clothing, Emily was shining beautifully.\u201cThen, Hilda, let\u2019s do our best today, too!\u201d\u201cYeah, you also\u2026\u201dTake care.\u00a0Especially around Adrian. He\u2019s actually a devil. All he thinks about is killing people. I, myself, almost died one too many times. But I survived!\u201c\u2026See you at lunch.\u201dI forced myself to gulp down these words that threatened to burst out of my lips and instead waved goodbye. A clear laugh rang out.\u201cCome on, you were acting like you\u2019re gonna say something big just now, but what\u2019s with the flat goodbye. I\u2019ll come help you later after this morning\u2019s tasks, so don\u2019t overwork yourself!\u201dEmily\u2019s really nice. She\u2019s the only one who worried about me and took care of me like this in the game. I know she\u2019s only acting according to her programming, but I\u2019m still hoping that her life won\u2019t end in pain. Wouldn\u2019t it be fairer if a good person could get a happy ending?Looking at her retreating figure as she went into the mansion, I turned around and looked at the garden. Yesterday, this workplace of mine was like the devil\u2019s garden itself, but right now, I could see only a treasure trove of EXP.It\u2019s only 1 EXP per weed pulled, but if it\u2019s all piled up, then it\u2019s not such an insignificant amount. From the EXP I\u2019ll gain here, I plan to raise my level and become the last player standing in this world.\u300c Gained 1 EXP from removing weeds. \u300d\u300c Gained 1 EXP from removing weeds. \u300d\u300c Work is going smoothly because your fatigue is low. \u300d\u300c Work is going extremely smoothly because your fatigue is low. \u300d\u300c The success rate for weed pulling has risen significantly. \u300d\u300c Your daily wage has increased. \u300d\u300c The amount of EXP acquired has increased significantly. \u300d\u300c Gained 5 EXP from removing weeds. \u300dWow, one weed became 5 EXP, you say? When I thought about what happened yesterday, when the system wouldn\u2019t give me even 1 EXP, this was an unprecedented increase.I can\u2019t believe that my experience points and daily wage are influenced by my physical condition. This was one more reason why, from now on, I must go as far as to risk my life for the sake of protecting my dear pillow.Surprisingly, this game\u2019s essential item was a pillow? It would be good if I could buy some more in case the one I have now suddenly lowered in durability again.\u300c Gained 5 EXP from removing weeds. \u300d\u300c Gained 5 EXP from removing weeds. \u300d\u300c Critical Hit! Gained 10 EXP from removing weeds. \u300dI was mechanically pulling weeds with my hands when these white letters suddenly popped up.What \u2018critical hit\u2019 are you talking about now, it\u2019s not like this is a rhythm game.Well, this was what I thought, but it\u2019s still rather fun so I continued moving my hands in earnest.\u300c Gained 5 EXP from removing weeds. \u300d\u300c Critical Hit! Gained 10 EXP from removing weeds. \u300d\u300c Critical Hit! Gained 10 EXP from removing weeds. \u300dWhat the hell, this is really fun. When the EXP bar, which was previously filled with as little as ant piss, rose evidently, my heart was also filled with this strange pride.Did you know that I like RPGs, that\u2019s why you came up with this kind of system? And perhaps because the weed pulling was either \u2018success\u2019 or \u2018great success,\u2019 all the areas where my hands swept through became noticeably neat. It\u2019s not just a matter of weed whacking\u2014it\u2019s like a brand new garden was being created.It\u2019s not like I\u2019m just praising myself or being narcissistic. When Emily came around by noon, her admiration was proof enough that I really was doing a good job.\u201cWow, Hilda\u2026 Did you really clean up everything here? Oh my gosh, it\u2019s perfect.\u201d\u201cPerfect,\u00a0psh. You\u2019re making me blush.\u201d\u201cYou made a complete mess yesterday, but how did you make everything so neat this time? Mister Ancier didn\u2019t come and secretly help you, right? No, he should be busy tending to the Madam\u2019s garden and planting flowers right about now. Miss Leticia\u2019s seriously going to faint from shock after seeing this.\u201d\u201cOh you, to go that far\u2026\u201d\u201cHilda, I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201dEmily looked at me with her eyes shining brightly, glistening with tears. She was the proudest and most supportive friend there ever could be when it came to the great endeavor of weed pulling. It sounded ridiculous even to me, but the corners of my lips went up for no reason.Wasn\u2019t there a saying that compliments made whales dance? As if to show off, I pulled the last weed there was and\u2014 another critical hit!Emily burst out in tears of admiration, praising me again about how perfectly I pulled out the weed. Then, we went together to the dining hall for lunch.As we walked side by side while talking about what we did this morning, the sudden sound of shattering plates could be heard from a distance. It wasn\u2019t just a single plate\u2014it sounded like dozens upon dozens of plates were getting shattered all at once.\u201cLet\u2019s hurry.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then, Leticia\u2019s sharp voice could be heard through one slightly opened kitchen window.\u201cDelores! What on earth have you been doing all morning! Augh, look at all the plates. Everything\u2019s just\u2026 haa.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Miss Leticia\u2026\u201d\u201cJust how many plates do you think you broke! It\u2019s not enough that you were dozing off, but you\u2019ve actually lost your mind! I saw you doze off while standing several times and I just pretended not to know, but then you do\u00a0this?!\u201dShe pretended not to notice that one of her employees was dozing off? Leticia\u2019s actually a pretty kind boss, huh.If a department head were to see a team member dozing off at the desk, lunch break would be plagued with the passive-aggressive attacks of, \u2018I guess you\u2019re not getting a lot of work these days, huh, Miss/Mister this or that? Or did you finish early because of your amazing skills? Wow, you can go ahead and start a business for yourself. Huh? Oh, no no, you have to eat a lot\u2014hurry now, go ahead and eat. Eat comfortably.\u2019Anyone caught dozing off would immediately get chewed up, and you\u2019d inevitably go back upstairs with a stomach ache.\u201cI\u2019m sorry Miss Leticia. I-It\u2019s because, because I didn\u2019t sleep well\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you sleep! You\u2019re given proper accommodation and you finish work on time anyway, so what reason is there for you not to sleep?!\u201dEmily had already entered the kitchen and started to help clean up the broken plates. I was wondering who Delores was, then I remembered that she was one of the people who called me out to the backyard before\u2014one of the bullies with a pixelated name.Hands on her waist, Leticia was practically fuming with her face all blue. Delores just had her hands clasped together, wondering what she should do. After a while, she spoke in a sobbing voice.\u201cBecause my pillow,\u00a0hiic, suddenly disappeared\u2026\u201dSo. Delores was the owner of my new pillow\u00a0and\u00a0the female lead of those evening trysts outside my window.I crouched down to help Emily get all the shards. Even though it was just the simple task of picking up the pieces, there were several times that\u00a0Critical Hit!\u00a0popped out, and I steadily accumulated EXP. Emily watched me with a slight look of admiration. Aha, this game is starting to grow on me.\u201cWhat? Your\u00a0pillow\u2019s\u00a0gone, that\u2019s why you couldn\u2019t sleep?! Where did you leave your pillow, huh? You can\u2019t even keep it properly!\u201d\u201cI really don\u2019t know. I went out of my room for a little while last night, and when I came back, it was already gone. That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t sleep at all, and I was really tired\u2026\u201dApart from the set-up of not being able to sleep without a pillow, it seemed like the fatigue system was also being applied to the other characters in the game. Seriously. Was the developer of this game a ghost who died in their sleep because they didn\u2019t have a pillow? Why else would there be so much riding on a mere pillow?Leticia let out a long-drawn sigh and shook her head. In other words, this was practically saying to Delores, \u2018What\u2019s the point?\u2019\u201cUm, Miss Leticia. Someone must have stolen my pillow. They\u2019re sabotaging me! If you can just help me find who it is\u2014!\u201d\u201cShut up! You couldn\u2019t even do your work properly and now you\u2019re kicking up a fuss! Why are you trying to shift the blame when it\u2019s you who didn\u2019t take care of your belongings!\u201d\u201cMiss Leticia!\u201d\u201cI said shut it! Are you expecting me to clean up the plates you broke, too?!\u201dDelores couldn\u2019t win Leticia over at all as the older woman was quite literally fuming as she stomped away. Delores could only shed a few tears as if she was feeling unfair, then with a huff, she soon turned around.To be exact, she looked in this direction, so when our eyes met, I felt a little guilty.\u201cYou\u00a0did it!\u201dDelores shouted with such resentment that it felt like she was going to beat me to death. This time, I was the one who got flustered.How did you know I did it?\u201cWhat are you talking about, Delores! How can you suspect someone so suddenly, and without any evidence, too! Our Hilda isn\u2019t like that!\u201dUm, it really was me though, Emily.\u201cYou\u2019ll\u00a0see.\u201dCrunch, crunch.\u00a0With the clearly audible gritting of her teeth, Delores ran straight out of the kitchen. You\u2019re leaving without even cleaning up these plates?\u201cDon\u2019t mind what Delores is saying, Hilda. She\u2019s just doing that because her conscience is getting prickled.\u201d\u201cHuh? Conscience?\u201d\u201cThat girl, she used to take your pillow and hide it whenever she found the chance.\u201dWhat? What did you just say?\u201cHilda\u2026 You, seriously. How can you forget when you were so angry about it?\u201d\u201cNo. I recalled what happened before and I felt my anger shooting up, but I\u2019m trying to keep calm.\u201d\u201cReally? Sorry. Well, don\u2019t mind her. She\u2019s just getting her karma.\u201dEmily patted me on the back and gently soothed me. Maybe she\u2019s wondering if I\u2019d really get upset.Pretending to hold in my anger, I let out a long exhale and went back to picking up the shards.Indeed, it made sense now why Leticia said that I used to make a lot of mistakes at work before. Hilda had strong attributes and she didn\u2019t seem like she was easily fatigued, so I was wondering why she made so many mistakes in the past.I know what the cause had been now\u2014and this meant that Hilda had, many a time, gone through what Delores was experiencing right now.I guess you could say we swapped places for the day. However, if it was just based on that, the look in Delores\u2019 eyes was much too fiery.This game was already difficult enough. I couldn\u2019t even gain allies that much, and there\u2019s no need to raise the difficulty by gaining enemies here.What should I do.\u201cHilda, let\u2019s go get our lunch.\u201dAight. Let\u2019s eat first, and then let\u2019s think about it later.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I have my hands full today, so I\u2019m asking you.\u201dEverything was going so smoothly today that even lunch was bursting with critical hits, but then suddenly, things went to a stop. With a grimace, I thought, \u2018Why me?\u2019 but Emily already rose from her seat as though she was waiting for the chance. Soon, the sound of teacups and tea leaves being skillfully placed on the tray rang in the air.\u201cI knew it, our Hilda is amazing. If I were you, I\u2019d say I wouldn\u2019t go because it\u2019s terrifying.\u201dWhile she was busy arranging the things on the tray, I just relaxed around the kitchen. I\u2019ve somewhat adjusted to the game now, and with a full stomach, I secretly fantasized about coffee. Back when I worked part-time in a caf\u00e9 during college, I used to drink coffee all the time.Ah, come to think of it.I looked around the spacious kitchen. Fellow servants were busy with their own tasks because the count, the countess and Adrian had separately just finished their lunch. This meant that no one would care if I\u00a0just\u00a0so happened to swipe something for myself.Since this was a well-to-do count household, it wasn\u2019t lacking anything. From coffee that could be espresso shots, milk, and then white sugar. \u2018Kay then, let\u2019s see here. If I mix this and that, then I can make something similar.I brought a tall glass and added sugar and milk into it, pounding into the mixture with a spoon so that foam would rise. If there was a French press around here, then I would have been able to make frothed milk quickly, but alas. I had to make do with manually doing it, and somehow the foam rose up.\u201cHilda, what are you doing? What\u2019s with the bubbles?\u201d\u201cMmh, I\u2019ll put it in my coffee. Do you have a tall glass? I\u2019ll give you some so you can taste it.\u201d\u201cO-Okay.\u201dEmily set down the tray and brought a glass of her own. As each cube of ice rattled as I poured the drink over them, the fragrant aroma of coffee lingered around the tip of my nose. Then, after I filled the other half of the glass with foamed milk, I poured in the espresso shot and made an artistic marbling over the surface.Since Emily had never seen anything like this, she looked at me with a bewildered expression.\u201cHilda! Where did you learn how to do something like this?\u201d\u201cWhen I used to work part-time at a caf\u00e9\u2026 Uh, just drink it first.\u201dI let out a careless answer mistakenly, but I quickly covered it up by pushing the glass into her hands. Not expecting this, Emily took it and looked at it intently first, then she cautiously took a sip. Then, she covered her lips.\u201cOh my word, how delicious!\u201d\u201cReally? That\u2019s great. Go ahead and drink all of that. I\u2019ll make some for myself later.\u201dI could only make a clumsy cold brew latte with the ingredients I had on hand, but the espresso here wasn\u2019t so bad. In the end, the latte still tasted good enough.Emily praised the coffee nonstop and downed the rest of it while I made more. It\u2019s always a nice feeling whenever someone genuinely enjoys the coffee I made.\u201cRight, Hilda. This is the tea that you\u2019ll be bringing to the Madam. I put the tea leaves in it already, so all you have to do is go up, take out the strainer, let it cool for a sec, and then pour some for her. You\u2019ll have to wait for her until she\u2019s done drinking, you know that right? You can come back with the tray after that.\u201dActually, I didn\u2019t know about any of that, but I still nodded towards Emily, who kindly gave me instructions. There was a white milk foam beard on her lips, but Emily continued sipping without knowing this.\u201cI\u2019ll come back soon, Emily.\u201d\u201cOkay. What you have there is scalding boiled water, so be careful with your hands! It\u2019s the room at the end of the hallway on the second floor, you know that right? Knock on the door and then tell the Madam that you\u2019ve brought her tea. Even if there\u2019s no answer, you can go in.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make you another glass of coffee, so you don\u2019t have to save it. I\u2019ll be back.\u201dI gave a wide grin to the also smiling Emily, and then I proceeded to head for the countess\u2019 room with the tray in my hands. The room at the end of the hallway on the second floor, the room at the end of the hallway on the second fl\u2026While recalling Emily\u2019s words, it suddenly struck me\u2014she also said, \u2018If I were you, I\u2019d say I wouldn\u2019t go because it\u2019s terrifying.\u2019 When she said that, she shook her head as she shuddered.The countess was a normal human being though, not a devil. So why? What\u2019s so scary about her?\u201cI\u2019ve come to bring your tea, Madam.\u201dI knocked on the door, but there was no answer coming from inside, just as Emily told me. I waited for a moment before I opened the door. But when I stepped in, I was shocked even more than when I first saw Adrian.Gasp\u2026What kind of room\u2026 While a rotten stench wafted in the air, there was blood all over the place. It smelled exactly as if that red fluid had been hand-smeared throughout the wallpaper. Old, rotten, but the unmistakable metallic stench of blood.I looked away, but the moment I did, I thought I was going to faint.Right there, the body of a blood-soaked goat was hanging on the wall.Oh my god, all those red streaks on the wall were from that goat\u2019s blood? But where did its head go? Why was only its body hanging there?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With a low voice, she hummed the melody of a lullaby, singing to the thing she was cradling in her arms. It was wrapped in a blanket.Oh my god\u2026 I forgot about it because of that shitty system, but this game\u2019s genre was\u00a0horror.\u00a0But it was supposed to be because of Adrian, not the countess!\u201cRock a bye\u2026 rock a bye\u2026 baby\u2026 sleep\u2026 sleep now\u2026 my baby\u2026\u201dCreeeak, creeeack.Whenever the chair rocked back and forth, the creaking sound mixed together with the humming voice, and it created an even more terrifying atmosphere. My heart shrank and my heartbeat raced. My hands were trembling uncontrollably, and the teacup on the tray clattered endlessly.I-It\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s calm down. She\u2019s just a bit coocoo. Let\u2019s just give her the tea right away and book it\u2026I calmly placed the tray down on the table and poured the pot of tea that Emily prepared over the cup. The rich, thick scent of Early Grey wafted through the air as the tea flowed down, but when it became mixed with the metallic smell of the room, it stabbed harder at my nose. My eyes were already burning with tears.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhat was she thinking. The countess was watching me as my hands quivered while pouring tea. Usually in a horror movie, if someone like the countess appeared on the screen, there would be a jumpscare as she\u2019d suddenly come running at me with a loud sound effect.Just imagining it\u2026 made me feel even more terrified.Let\u2019s just hurry and finish what to do here.\u201cP-Please drink, Madam.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll leave the tea here on the table. I\u2019ll wait until you\u2019re done drinking, so dri\u2026 drink slowly. Uu\u2026urk.\u201dTrying to control the tremors passing through my hands as much as I could, I placed the cup on the table\u2014but then I finally saw what the countess was holding.With flies hovering over it, what\u2019s in her arms was the severed goat head. It\u2019s unknown when exactly that head was chopped off.Why the hell are you holding such a\u2026\u201cSleep now, sleep now\u2026 my\u2026 baby\u2026\u201dShe did not even look at the teacup I had set down for her to drink. She only stared back at me with eyes that were so black that her pupils couldn\u2019t be identified.Ten seconds passed by as slowly as ten years. No, did time even pass by? How would I possibly be able to wait until she\u2019s all done drinking the tea?I\u2019d rather be killed.\u201cSleep now, sleep now\u2026\u201d\u201cUm, Madam. Perhaps, is there something that you\u2019d like me to do for you?\u201dI asked, barely pressing down on the urge to scream. What I meant to say is that please,\u00a0please\u00a0don\u2019t look at me if there\u2019s nothing you want me to do\u2014but it didn\u2019t work.\u00a0Oh, you don\u2019t have a task for me. Haha.Even when I walked away with an awkward smile, her eyes were persistently on me. It\u2019s so terrible. In terms of atmosphere, Adrian was much better than the countess.As my fear shot through the roof, I recalled one resentful person at a time.Why did Leticia send me here as a substitute? Hilda\u2019s a natural worker, but she\u2019s not fearless!And Emily. Why did she let me come here anyway when she knew that I was gonna be scared? She even went as far as telling me to wait until the countess was done drinking her tea. Why couldn\u2019t she repay my kindness when I even made her that coffee\u2026\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBut wait a sec. Was the countess staring at\u00a0me\u2026\u00a0or maybe\u2026?I paused and looked alternately at the coffee on the tray in my hands, then to the countess. Come to think of it, her eyes were fixed at around my chest, not at my face. Was she looking at the coffee? I made this for myself so I could drink it later though.\u201cUm, perhaps, Madam. Do you like coffee? I made this myself, but would you like to have a taste?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, um, I\u2019ll pour some for you. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d like the taste of it though.\u201dAfter pouring out the tea inside the cup, I replaced it with the coffee and frothed milk together. Then, the countess slowly raised her hand and took the cup.Seeing her sip it quickly, she must have wanted the coffee instead of the tea.You should have just told me then\u2026 You looked at me with those terrifying eyes. I thought you were gonna come running at me\u2026\u300c You gifted Priscilla some \u2018Rare Coffee\u2019. \u300d\u300c Priscilla is immensely delighted. \u300d\u300c Priscilla\u2019s favorability has risen by 300 points. \u300d\u300c Priscilla\u2019s favorability : Lvl.4 (0/200) \u300dJust like when I had my first conversation with Adrian and when my level went up by five, the bar over Priscilla\u2019s head was suddenly filled as her favorability points shot up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But what\u2019s the point in raising the countess\u2019 favorability? She\u2019s already gone bonkers.\u201c\u2026Did you say your name was Hilda?\u201d\u201cY-Yes.\u201dI was a little surprised to hear the countess\u2019 voice. As I heard her speak normally for the first time, her voice was as soft and sweet as whipped cream. As I watched her set down the empty cup with a gentle gaze on it, I also found her to have a very caring atmosphere.The lurching urge to vomit from seeing the goat\u2019s head in her arms had yet to recede, but as I saw the warmth in her eyes, I did start to feel some sympathy for her.The original countess wouldn\u2019t have ended up like this. Since she was a soft and gentle person, her mind was susceptible to collapsing all together like this.\u201cGo downtown.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to see in the town. Mister Andrew, the teahouse owner\u2014he said that he brought in some orange-flavored Rooibos tea from a faraway place, but I haven\u2019t checked just yet. I don\u2019t know if the shop is doing well now.\u201d\u300c Map, open! You can now go to the village of Ida. \u300d\u300c You can now go outside the manor. \u300dAt the unexpected development, the white text made me pause. I was blocked from leaving the manor yesterday because it said I couldn\u2019t go out. I didn\u2019t know that the countess was the key for this.My heart almost stopped because of how terrifying this room was, but if Leticia hadn\u2019t sent me here as a replacement, then I wouldn\u2019t have been able to open the map and I would have just been stuck inside the manor all the time.In addition to gaining more skills as my EXP rose, I didn\u2019t know that it was important to increase the favorability of the major characters by interacting with them. If I knew it was going to be like this, then I should have picked up some other things and gave them all to Adrian.Since he\u2019s the main character, wouldn\u2019t there be even better benefits if I raise his favorability?\u201cRock a bye, rock a bye\u2026 my\u2026 baby\u2026\u201dIt was only for a moment that the countess came back to her senses. She bowed her head again and continued humming the lullaby. As if this was a meandering dream, the hazy voice and the red room were both a whole lot creepy when combined together.Even so, as I recalled the countess\u2019 expression earlier, I now felt pity rather than fear.It\u2019s weird, too.Probably because I knew her backstory about being aware that Adrian was a devil.All the people in this world who didn\u2019t know the truth about Adrian were just pointing their fingers at the countess and calling her crazy. She was someone who finally broke down after shouting the truth to everyone, yet no one believed her.This woman who was trapped in an empty room as she shouted into the void became empty herself\u2026\u201cI\u2019ll come back to visit you, Madam.\u201d\u201cSleep now, sleep now\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll buy more ingredients from the village and bring you more delicious coffee.\u201dBefore leaving through the door with the tray in my hands, I bowed to the countess. She still didn\u2019t look back, but her drooping shoulders looked immensely lonely.I was already about to close the door silently, but the dreary voice sank lower than before, and I heard a new line of the lullaby through the small gap in the door.\u201cRest now, die now, sleep, sleep now\u2026 my\u2026 Adrian\u2026\u201dMy hand paused on the doorknob.Without realizing it, my eyes widened as I pulled the door open again, but I could no longer hear the song. Seeing as how the countess\u2019 head was leaning forward, her neck bending over like a drooping branch, it seemed like she had already fallen asleep.Did I\u2026 hear it wrong? I thought I heard Adrian\u2019s name.I didn\u2019t know where this sudden sense of creepiness was coming from, but I looked around the hallway in fear. I was the only one here in this long corridor, and all I could hear was the sound of empty wind.It\u2019s weird. I couldn\u2019t breathe. It\u2019s not the same feeling I had when I was in front of Adrian. The breaths I took in were cold, and as I exhaled, my throat stung. The tip of my nose ached as my breaths became rougher.I reached for the knob again so that I could close the door with my trembling hand. I couldn\u2019t help but look through the gap in the door, and I saw the countess\u2019 thin neck.She slowly turned her head halfway\u2014and our eyes met.I slammed the door closed to the point that my nose almost got caught, and at the same time, my heart started racing in my chest.I started feeling dizzy. There was a ringing sound in my ears that it felt like one of the flies hovering over the goat\u2019s head was buzzing near me.\u201cThe wind\u2014I must have misheard the sound of the wind\u2026\u201dI left out a long exhale so that I could calm myself down. The countess loves Adrian. As much as she loved him, she was in shock. Despite the tragedy that happened, it would have happened earlier if not for that.Rushing down to the first floor, I inhaled the cold air. The ringing in my ears subsided a little when I heard the other servants talking as they passed by.It felt like I\u2019ve just emerged from a murky quagmire.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sure, you have skills now, but nobody ever said you can use them as you please.Translated by YonneeI saw something terrible in the countess\u2019 room, so I felt so much relief the moment I saw Emily and Catarina\u2019s faces when I returned to the kitchen.Emily took the tray from me and looked at me with worried eyes. She seemed to know exactly why my face had become as white as a sheet.Wiping off the cold sweat that was trickling down my forehead, I opened my lips to speak belatedly.\u201cEmily, have you seen how it is? Inside the\u2026 the Madam\u2019s room.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t come with you, Hilda. I actually fainted back then, even before I entered the room. Right at the door.\u201d\u201cAnd Emily was bedridden for days. Every time she closed her eyes, she screamed while thinking of that red room. But\u2026 It took you a while to get better, right, Emily?\u201d\u201cI was just so terrified. It\u2019s scary just thinking about how it looks.\u201dHer downcast eyes trembled uneasily. Indeed. Even someone like me, who knew that this place wasn\u2019t real, trembled just after seeing it. But how much more frightening and terrifying would it be for someone who thought that this was all real?\u201cHas the\u2026 Has the Madam been like that ever since she lost her senses?\u201d\u201cYeah. She\u2019s been like that ever since. But where do you think she got that goat from? Even when someone takes the goat\u2019s corpse from the room, it\u2019ll soon come back after a while. It hasn\u2019t been long since the Madam moved rooms, but then all the wallpaper has gone red with blood already, and there are crosses everywhere, too\u2026\u201d\u201cShe moved rooms?\u201d\u201cYeah. Once she\u2019s made her room that way, we\u2019ll have to clean it up of course, so we\u2019ll move her things to the next room while cleaning up. But even in the next room, she\u2019d bring a dead goat and paint the entire room with blood. Her room right now is the last one on the left wing of the second floor. All the other rooms are just like that\u2026\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t help but talk about it even though we keep it at a hush.\u201dCatarina sighed deeply.\u201cI went to the village a few days ago and the boutique owner auntie said something to me. There\u2019s a terrible rumor going around about the Madam.\u201d\u201cWhat should we do?\u201dEmily asked with anxious eyes.\u201cI hinted at it with Miss Leticia about it little by little. The Count also seems to know about it to a certain extent. There\u2019s no way he wouldn\u2019t know when that kind of rumor is being spread like that\u2026 I guess that\u2019s why the Madam is being moved to a different residence soon.\u201d\u201cWhat? The Madam\u2019s being sent somewhere else?\u201d\u201cYeah. The Madam isn\u2019t in her right mind, so they\u2019re trying to focus on her treatment in a much quieter place. But if this story gets spread, then there\u2019s going to be a lot of malicious talk. So, let\u2019s just be quiet. Pretend you don\u2019t know.\u201dCatarina whispered, lowering her voice to the quietest she could speak.Indeed, if the count were to remain in the manor while only the countess was going to move to a different residence, then rumors saying that they had a bad relationship would naturally follow. Since there were already some rumors saying that the countess wasn\u2019t of her right mind, then the other story would easily gain traction.\u201cAnyway, Hilda, you must have been very surprised. Miss Leticia told me to tell you that you can go and get some fresh air at the village.\u201d\u201cCan I go to the village now?\u201dMy eyes widened, wondering why it was as easy as pie now. Even if the town map was opened, I thought it would be hard to go out unless I got a holiday or something.\u201cMm-hmm. She said that it must have been hard because you had to see the Madam. Besides, let\u2019s just say that she was also pleasantly surprised to see the work you did in the garden this morning. She complimented you a lot and said that you can take some time off for the rest of the day. Ah! It\u2019s awkward to say this now, but it would be really great if you could also run a few errands.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that great, Hilda?\u201dEmily clasped her hands together as she looked at me with a very proud expression\u2026 Somehow, I felt shy, and so I laughed awkwardly.I took note of Catarina\u2019s errand, then, it didn\u2019t take long until I then went to the village. Since this was a magnificent count\u2019s residence, there were also many magnificent carriages available for use. The countess apparently gave me special permission to use one of them.Was this the power of favorability points? I relaxed as I watched the scenery pass by quickly through the carriage\u2019s window.Yesterday, it felt exactly like I was hanging by a cliff, but today, I was sitting in a gold-gilded carriage with a dedicated driver as I was going leisurely to the village.I can\u2019t believe all this was from the power of a pillow.As I watched the shining blue scenery pass by while listening to the sound of the horses\u2019 hooves, both the tension inside me and my body\u2019s posture gradually loosened.I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019d adjusted too well to my small lodgings in the last few days, but I stuck to one corner because it felt awkward being in this expansive carriage interior that could possibly just be as wide as a room.However, as time went by, I eventually sat down while sitting back relaxedly. My legs weren\u2019t feeling cramped, and I had my arms behind my head.Going to the village inside a carriage like this with a dedicated coachman, it very much felt like I was riding an expensive luxury car just to go to the supermarket. Besides that, even if the road we were passing through was an unpaved road, the carriage didn\u2019t shake as much as it passed over jagged stones several times, so my butt didn\u2019t hurt at all.The ride was ever so smooth. This was the feeling of being a successful servant.\u201cHilda! We\u2019re here! Come out now!\u201dFeeling a bit proud of myself, I got off the carriage and entered the village.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sure, you have skills now, but nobody ever said you can use them as you please.Translated by YonneeFrom the entrance, it didn\u2019t seem like a big village, but it felt pleasant and refreshing for me. Especially since I was seeing another place that\u2019s outside the manor for the first time.It\u2019s like I\u2019m wearing a VR headset and walking around in a game that has a medieval setting. Still though, it was such a vivid sight that I wouldn\u2019t be able to see something like this in any VR game.\u201cThis evening gown had been worn by a princess from the neighboring country, and it\u2019s only 30 gold. As low as 30 gold! Try it on before you go, hm?\u201d\u201cA trip to Ghaliba, over the high seas and indeed difficult to obtain tickets to, only 5 gold now!\u201d\u201cOne last fountain pen left, one last highly rare fountain pen that even royal scribes can\u2019t easily get their hands on!\u201dThe marketplace here reminded me exactly of how it was in some traditional Korean street markets I\u2019ve been to before. Merchants were out in front of their stores and shouted loudly about their products so that they could entice some customers, who would look at their goods and hopefully buy some. The only difference was the era and western setting.\u201cHear, hear! This bastard sword\u00b9 is made from mithril of the highest grade. There\u2019s only five of \u2018em left, so get \u2018em while ya still can!\u201dWow. He went on to list more weapons\u2014swords, crossbows and iron clubs. My goodness, there\u2019s even some wooden training swords here? I can\u2019t believe I can see all the weapons that I\u2019ve only seen in games. Those are all real. Wow, just look at that sharp blade\u2026I admired the sword that looked like it came straight out of a fantasy movie. I was really into RPG games some time ago, and I actually tried to remake a legendary weapon that I wanted for myself.As it was only wrapped with tinfoil and was made so shabbily, that thing wouldn\u2019t even compare to this sword right here.I want one, that bastard sword. If I hold it real tight while I\u2019m on my way back to the real world, won\u2019t it come with me? I\u2019d like to have one as a souvenir at least\u2026Drooling in front of the bastard sword, the arms dealer glanced at me with a strange look, but I remained stuck on that glass case for a long time still. Suddenly, for the first time, it didn\u2019t feel so bad to be in this game.\u201cAh, right, right, Catarina asked me to do some errands.\u201dI recalled it only after looking around the village for quite a while. I took out the memo that was crumpled in my pocket and read one item at a time from the top. Sewing needles, cotton cloth, thread, salt, pepper\u2026 Good thing these weren\u2019t heavy things.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s see. General store first then!\u201dEvery game traditionally had a general store that carried some stuff like HP potions, MP\u00b2 potions, archer\u2019s arrows, and more. Even broke beginners who had low levels should visit the general store just to buy HP potions.When it comes to dealing with items, there\u2019s no gameplayer who wouldn\u2019t head to the general store if they were told, \u2018general store, go go\u2019. It\u2019s like the game version of a rendezvous point.\u201cWelcome! Oh, it\u2019s you! You\u2019re that child from the Pfalzgraf household, right?\u201dA middle-aged woman who seemed to be the general store\u2019s owner welcomed me first. There were some other people looking around inside the store, too. I nodded and took out the note that Catarina wrote for me.\u201cYes, uh, first of all, I need a sewing needle please, about five pieces for each length. And some cotton cloth.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. And you need some thread, right?\u201d\u201cYes. One spool, please. And\u2026\u201d\u201cA leather thimble, a metal thimble, yes?\u201dThe store owner kept taking things out from under the counter and listed off the things I needed before I could even say them. She\u2019s got real good business chops, I must say.\u201cYes, and also two wrist pincushions\u2026\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve got all different sizes. Take them all.\u201d\u201cHuh? All of them? But there\u2019s so many.\u201dI was still in the middle of reading through the list, but then the cash register was all ringed up with the items. They\u2019re all obviously what\u2019s on the list, but the quantity was too much.There was a set of 60 needles that went beyond five lengths, and a large bag was filled with cotton cloth. There were also ten pieces each for each pincushion size. Catarina didn\u2019t ask me to buy this much of everything though.\u201cFive needles are plenty, Ma\u2019am. And I just need about half of the cloth here. I didn\u2019t even bring enough money to pay for all this.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t pay for it and just take it.\u201d\u201cPardon? You\u2019re giving me all this for free?\u201dJust one glance at the items told me that they must cost around 50,000 won\u00b3, but the store owner was giving me all this for\u00a0free?Sus.Since everything went much too smoothly today, was this supposed to be some kind of trap that the game system made? If I take this all with me without paying a single penny, that system would surely point fingers at me and tell me again that I have zero conscience\u2014then it would rob me in broad daylight again as a reimbursement for stealing.With a wary look, I waited to see if the white letters would suddenly pop up. All the while, the general store owner just smiled at me pleasantly.\u201cIt\u2019s not a lie, and it\u2019s not a scam either, so you don\u2019t have to worry. You can just take it all. You\u2019re a precious customer from the Pfalzgraf household, so I\u2019d like to just give you all these. We owe the household a lot.\u201d\u201cOwe?\u201d\u201cOh my, oh my, of course we do. It\u2019s not just me, but all the villagers owe a debt of gratitude towards the Count. When our village was attacked by the bandits who were from the mountains, the Count sent knights to help us several times. And when the river overflowed because of the heavy rain not too long ago and many houses in the village were about to collapse, he helped us again. Not only the Count, but even the Young Master is also such a good person. He\u2019s so kind and gentle, oh he\u2019s really like an angel.\u201d\u201cHa, haha. Oh yes, of course\u2026\u201d\u00b9 bastard sword \u2013 a variation of a longsword which could be used with either one or two hands; it was given the name \u2018bastard\u2019 due to its ambiguous categorization, irregular traits and misleading appearance.\u00b2 HP \u2013 health points; MP \u2013 mana points\u00b3 50,000 won = around 40 usdPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sure, you have skills now, but nobody ever said you can use them as you please.Translated by YonneeTo call Adrian an angel\u2026 I wondered if there was ever any other combination out there that was so out of sync. Still though, I was surprised by the good deeds he had supposedly done. Of course, I still doubted what he was up to.\u201cIt\u2019s not just that. They built a new orphanage to gather and take care of all the children who lost their parents in the slums. Children who grow up in the slums inevitably learn to steal as soon as they can start running. We all have felt such a huge relief from this. So, whenever someone from the Pfalzgraf household comes, we give them everything. So, please don\u2019t feel pressured and just take it all.\u201d\u201cNo, but, it\u2019s really too much\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be shy! Take it all!\u201dBefore I could even decline, the general store owner packed everything at the speed of light and pushed them to me. The bag wasn\u2019t bulky because the items were packed in there one by one with practiced ease, but somehow, it felt like she put her raw feelings in there as well.It\u2019s not polite of me to keep refusing someone\u2019s sincerity when they continue to offer like this. Besides, it\u2019s a sign of gratitude towards the House Pfalzgraf, not me.\u201cAlright, thank you. May I ask where I can buy the rest of the items listed here?\u201d\u201cIf you go out through the door and turn right, you\u2019ll find the grocery store.\u201dEven though another customer had come to pay at the cashier, the general store owner came out with me to the street and tried to guide me there.She already showed me the way, so I tried to steer her back to her store since there was another customer waiting there, but she just proceeded to guide me all the way to the grocery store and said to the grocery store owner, \u201cThis customer\u2014 she works at the Pfalzgraf manor!\u201d\u201cOho, so you\u2019re from the Pfalzgraf manor, are you?\u201dThe grocery store owner\u2019s eyes twinkled.\u201cYes. So then, what I need is salt, pepper\u2026\u201dI was trying to recite the list\u2019s contents, but the grocery store owner snatched it out of my hands like an eagle. I thought he would take care of it, but he read a note with a sour expression and soon walked towards the shelves.\u201cWhat\u2019s written here is this, this\u2026 and this, too. Aha, you\u2019re gonna need this as well.\u201dIt was a similar scene to what happened in the general store.\u201cCome to think of it, it\u2019s been a while since the Count\u2019s residence has bought basil. But if there\u2019s basil, you\u2019re going to need rosemary, too. And then also bread spread\u2026 We\u2019ve got good quality condensed milk and butter this time, so I\u2019ll give you some samples.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBy the way, I\u2019ve also got some savory milk from the sheep ranch. Let me see here\u2026\u201d\u201cUm, excuse me, I think this is too much though.\u201d\u201cNot at all. Here, take all of this.\u201dAll kinds of sauces, spices and seasonings were taken from the shelves and placed on the counter. Obviously, Catarina had listed down a variety of spices, but it wasn\u2019t\u00a0this\u00a0much.I had the same thought in the general store, but can I really take all this with me without paying for them?That system. It\u2019s not going to rob me of my money again for this reason, is it? After telling me that I had no conscience, it just might play a joke and change my title again.With suspicion lacing my eyes, I stared out in the air and waited for it. But then, I suddenly felt sorry for myself. I feel like a gameplayer who\u2019s being harassed by the game\u2019s goods and system\u2026\u201cJust take it all, don\u2019t worry about it. Whenever someone from the Count\u2019s residence comes, they always take this much. With how much we owe the Count, what\u2019s one or two things for that.\u201d\u201cReally? Has our Count helped you that much?\u201d\u201cOf course! Do you know just how many people he has saved when they were about to die? The children who were lying lifelessly on the side of the road were all given a place to live in. And when they grow up, they\u2019re sent to cities far away so that they can study.\u201dSeeing how he said exactly what the general store owner said, the good deeds done by the count\u2019s family seemed to be all real. They established an orphanage, saved people from poverty, and Adrian was even being touted as an angel by the villagers\u2026 It was a backstory that I didn\u2019t know about at all while I was just playing the game.Because the game didn\u2019t show this village or anything, I couldn\u2019t go to this place at that time. It\u2019s interesting because it\u2019s like I\u2019m being given a peek into the behind-the-scenes story of the game. Like a director\u2019s cut of sorts.Still, I somehow felt goosebumps rising up my skin since it felt so realistic\u2014as though this was a real world with real people. The NPCs also have their own circumstances and backstories.So then, what\u2019s the difference between them and real people?I glanced at the grocery store owner\u2019s hand on the counter. His skin was pale and dry, and the veins that protruded bulged noticeably. They were thick, and this alone showed just how hard he was working to maintain this store.I wondered if there was real blood pulsing in that vein. Or if I held it, would it feel warm?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sure, you have skills now, but nobody ever said you can use them as you please.Translated by Yonnee\u201cOther noble lords are much harsher. Our village is blessed. We thank God every day that we serve such a great man.\u201dIn the meantime, the grocery store owner kept praising Count Pfalzgraf to death.I forced myself to look away from his hand. Even if it really had warmth in it, that\u2019s something programmed into his character, too. It wouldn\u2019t mean anything.\u201cOf course, yes, you\u2019re always grateful\u2026 But what of Young Master Adrian? Does he also stop by this village?\u201d\u201cI heard that he drops by from time to time, but I haven\u2019t gotten the chance to see him at all. Even if he came, he wouldn\u2019t come meet us merchants. But you know, the Countess is very devout, so won\u2019t she come by the parish sometime? I heard that she\u2019s very ill. Is she doing alright these days?\u201dLeaning his torso forward slightly with the body language that made it apparent that he was listening intently, he seemed to want to hear some gossip about the countess. The rumors were already out that her condition wasn\u2019t good, but they seemed to be keeping it a hush amongst themselves.\u201cYes, she\u2019s gotten a lot better. But it\u2019s difficult for a servant like me to meet her directly.\u201d\u201cReally? No, I just\u2026 That, um, it\u2019s just, someone who\u2019s always coming to the parish so often over the years suddenly isn\u2019t coming anymore. I was just worried!\u201d\u201cI understand. Thank you for your concern.\u201dAfter that cursory answer, I prepared to leave the store. I was carrying so many bags with me now that I had to try and squeeze some others in a bigger bag because it was so uncomfortable to carry all of them as is. But then the white letters, which I seldom wished to see, appeared as though they were dancing in front of my eyes.\u300c The bag has exceeded the weight limit. You cannot put more items in. \u300dThe items slipped out of the bag as if they were pushed out by an invisible hand, just like the time when I tried to lie down in bed without a pillow.\u300c Would you like to purchase an item that can temporarily increase the weight limit of your bag? (Price : 40G) \u300d\u201cWow, and I thought things were going well already, but now everything\u2019s\u2026\u201d40 gold? Which punk said 40 gold? There\u2019s no such thing as death\u2019s embrace. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s selling products to me now\u2026\u201cHuh? What did you say?\u201dThe grocery store owner looked up as he was organizing the groceries so that they could be placed in the bag properly.\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u300c Would you like to purchase an item that can temporarily increase the weight limit of your bag? (Price : 40G) \u300dI picked up another item, and at the same time, the white text popped up in front of me again. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s selling me something that gets\u00a0temporarily\u00a0applied to a bag\u2014to\u00a0me\u00a0when I had only 6 gold.This system was like a thief who\u2019d come every night to rob me blind, and then proceeded to come back during the day to sell me the same things. I\u2019m not buying it! Not at all!\u201cAh, I guess you don\u2019t have enough space in the bag to hold all of this. There\u2019s no extra bags left over either.\u201d\u300c Would you like to purchase a bag? (Price : 50G) \u300dAs soon as the store owner expressed his concern, the white letters of the system popped up at just the right timing as though it was waiting for the chance. I wondered if there was an NPC hiding behind the system, making a living out of\u00a0my\u00a0money.\u201cIt\u2019s no problem. You can take out some of the items out of the bag to free up some space. I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ll come back for the rest of them the next time I visit. I don\u2019t have enough hands, you see\u2026\u201d\u201cRight, of course. That\u2019s too bad. When you return, please say hi to Miss Leticia for me.\u201dIt was better to throw away things that weren\u2019t mine in the first place than to spend my own money to keep them. Sifting through the things that the grocery store owner had put into the bag, I nonchalantly took out the things that weren\u2019t in Catarina\u2019s list and left only what I needed to bring back, that being salt and pepper.As if it didn\u2019t expect my response, the white letters popped up again. Urgently this time.\u300c Would you like to purchase a bag? (Special price : 30G) \u300dIt knew that I wouldn\u2019t buy it, so just look at how that price is going down. I still won\u2019t buy it even if it\u2019s 10 gold.I snorted loudly as I saw the system\u2019s reaction, then sauntered out to the street. The village wasn\u2019t big, so I could just walk around for ten minutes and I\u2019d have already seen the entire place. However, amongst the various shops here, there was one shop that caught my eye.\u201cWelcome.\u201dIt was the bedding store. There was a bed being displayed near the entrance, and there were more items at the back, too. Pillows that were the hot item these days, wooden pillows that helped support the neck, white pillows made out of goose feathers, and lamps that were arranged side by side\u2014everything caught my eye. I was already drooling over the display case by the time the shop owner approached.\u201cI see that you\u2019re interested in our pillows. A lot of new products have come in this time. I\u2019ll open the display case for you so you can try touching them.\u201dWhen the shop owner opened one side of the display case, helpful descriptions appeared in small status windows next to the various pillows.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What would happen if I had that mythic pillow?But as I looked at the prices, I recalled that the pillow I broke before must have been a high quality pillow. It shocked me quite a bit to find out that it wasn\u2019t just an ordinary pillow. Then wasn\u2019t Adrian\u2019s pillow a legendary one?

I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve reached the point where I have only 1 gold.I stood there, waiting for the shop assistant to pack the pillow and give it to me, but then I overheard the voices of other customers who came in to look at some beds.\u201c\u2026Anyway, did you hear the rumor? You know Jake, he just disappeared one day and then his body was found by the river a few days ago, with, well, his wrist severed.\u201d\u201cReally?

Oh my god, how dreadful\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s been a few disappearances before, too. I think the most recent incident was about two years ago? It\u2019s the same this time. He was stabbed to death. The work was so neat that it\u2019s said to be the handiwork of an expert. Inspector Harrison had a few suspects in mind and he locked up all of them, but now it\u2019s all useless. He was so confident that the murders wouldn\u2019t ever happen again. Even if he had a mouth, what could he say?\u201d\u201cOh goodness, this is so scary. Every time we start to forget, it all happens again\u2026 We should stop going out at night.\u201dThe two of them huddled together and whispered to themselves, but their voices were clear to both me and the shop owner a short distance away. Murders in this area, they said. Every few years.\u201cDo you think it\u2019s the same culprit? Or maybe it\u2019s a different one this time. Maybe imitating the method.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say such terrible things. If you think that there are not just one but multiple people like that in this small village\u2026 I\u2019m getting goosebumps.

I\u2019ve never seen your face around these parts before though\u2026\u201dWith eyes full of vigilance, maybe they saw something odd about me so they looked at me more suspiciously.

She works at the Pfalzgraf household.\u201d\u201cThe Pfalzgraf household? Ahh, you should have told me. Gosh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cJust excuses wouldn\u2019t do much, I know. But it\u2019s also because we\u2019re scared of the rumors going around.\u201dWhen the bedding store owner approached and spoke up about where I was from, the two others relaxed their expressions surprisingly quickly. They seemed to be more relieved to hear that I was someone who worked for Count Pfalzgraf\u2019s family.\u201cHow is it in the Pfalzgraf manor these days? His Lordship is so kind-hearted that it must be easy to work for him. By the way, my daughter is turning thirteen years old this year and she\u2019s got skilled hands and good ears. It would be so great if she could go to the Count\u2019s manor and work there, too.\u201d\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you tell me last week that your daughter ruined all your clothes while doing the laundry? You can\u2019t make her work there. Miss, why don\u2019t you meet my child instead? My child is really good at working. And I\u2019m not joking here\u2014\u201d\u201cOh, so are you saying that complimenting my daughter is a joke, huh?\u201dUp until now, they were talking leisurely while sitting on that bed, but the two people started fighting now. As they said, \u2018What did you say about my daughter?\u2019 and \u2018What did\u00a0you\u00a0say about my daughter?\u2019 in increasingly louder tones, I looked at them with a strange sense of wonder.It\u2019s the first time in my life that I\u2019m being asked to be a person of reference. I\u2019m just a mere worker in the Pfalzgraf manor and I\u2019m already hearing something like this. It\u2019s a testament to just how great the status of the count was.As soon as I entered this village, the entire world seemed to be screaming at me that House Pfalzgraf was a prestigious and well-respected family. And since it was like that, it would be absurd for anyone to suspect that the successor to such a household was a devil and a serial killer.\u201cUm, do you know more details about the murders they were talking about earlier?\u201dI turned to the bedding store owner and asked her instead because it seemed impossible to ask the other two now. She smiled then answered.\u201cI don\u2019t know the details, but I do know some things since it\u2019s in my job description to meet people. What are you curious about?\u201d\u201cWas there anything unusual about the incident? Maybe the victims have something in common with each other? That is, do they work in the same area, do they frequent the same places\u2026\u201dSince it seemed like the rest of the world wasn\u2019t suspecting anyone from Pfalzgraf, there was no other choice for me but to doubt everything. Even if this was for the purpose of letting Adrian kill other people more easily, it felt as if I was being an accomplice so that he wouldn\u2019t get suspected.The welcoming atmosphere for any and all things related to House Pfalzgraf made me strangely uncomfortable.I might be being too sensitive here, but this was because I still felt chills running down my spine every time I saw Adrian. It felt like his eyes were seeing right through me, like he could clearly see what\u2019s going on in my head, and this instinctive fear was like a thorn that I just couldn\u2019t remove.\u201cUmm, no. The inspector said that the victims had nothing in common. That\u2019s why everyone\u2019s thinking that they\u2019re random cases of murder.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cWhat was it again? I think he said that he wasn\u2019t sure if the killer\u2019s a resident of this village. Some of the other victims are from the next village over, so he mentioned something about having to expand the scope of his investigation sooner or later. Gosh, it\u2019s so scary.\u201dAs the bedding store owner shuddered in fright, I probed again.\u201cWhere can I meet the inspector you mentioned?\u201d\u201cAre you going to meet him yourself?\u201d\u201cNo! I mean, not right away, I just want to know in case something might happen. I do work at the Pfalzgraf manor, but you never know if something would happen out there. Uuugh, I\u2019m also so scared.\u201dI shuddered in an exaggerated manner, and as the bedding store owner saw this, she nodded as if she understood my sentiments exactly.\u201cYes, it\u2019s a scary world, so it\u2019s important to be prepared at all times. But you\u2019ll definitely be safe in the Pfalzgraf manor. Probably a lot more than this village. Inspector Harrison\u2019s the one in charge of this case, but he\u2019s not technically a member of this village\u2019s neighborhood watch\u2014ah, that\u2019s the team that supports the police officers in crime prevention. The team\u2019s headquarters is located at the third alley next to my store. From faraway at the Lukebell Village, Inspector Harrison comes by here every few days and stays there.\u201d\u201cI see. Thank you so much for letting me know.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to be thankful about. Do you know how much our village owes His Lordship?\u201dThe bedding store owner gave me one last smile, then she turned to stop the other two people who were still fighting on that bed over there. I then left them behind and exited the store, following the bedding store owner\u2019s directions.I have to wonder though. As far as I\u2019ve seen, the game had given Adrian the characterization of a sickly constitution. He battled a lot of minor illnesses ever since he was young, and he constantly had to take medicine. Drinking medicine a little late would make him cough up blood, even as far as having to lie sick in bed for a few days after that.But you\u2019re telling me that he\u2019s running out to some other villages to kill people? No way.If this was the handiwork of someone else besides Adrian, then who was it?Who\u2019s the guy messing with Adrian\u2019s food in this game?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sure, you have skills now, but nobody ever said you can use them as you please.Translated by Yonnee\u201cHuh? What\u2019s that\u2026\u201dAs I walked around the village, I realized that if I looked at the shelves of the stores from where I was on the street\u2014just like in the bedding store\u2014descriptions would appear over the items. While passing by, I unconsciously walked closer to the writing equipment store because I saw some weird description for a pencil.\u300c Ordinary pencil \u2013 1G, a common pencil made from graphite rammed into wood. It serves its purpose well enough, but if you use it for a long time, it\u2019s too hard, so it\u2019ll hurt your hand. \u300dUntil this part, the item description was just normal, but what\u2019s unique about it was the explanation that was floating right underneath it.\u300c Adrian likes this item. \u300dI wonder why this kind of description didn\u2019t show up for the cold brew latte that I made myself. This one was openly telling me that it\u2019s a good gift item to raise someone\u2019s favorability points.What a shock though. Adrian likes\u00a0pencils?\u00a0A knife, maybe. Or a gun, perhaps a hammer\u2026 I kinda thought he\u2019d like items that could be used as a weapon to kill someone.I thought,\u00a0Huh, so there\u2019s a function like this, too,\u00a0and I was just about to pass like that. But something suddenly popped up in my mind, making me stop in my tracks\u2014the gift-giving counter floating on top of Adrian\u2019s and the countess\u2019 heads.The reason why I was given the chance to visit this village was, after all, because I coincidentally managed to raise the countess\u2019 favorability points with the coffee I made.Adrian was the main character of this game, and compared to other people, more points were required to raise his favorability level. I think the system will unlock something bigger if that\u2019s raised. Apart from that, the way the countess looked at me also changed when her favorability got higher.If I worked hard to raise Adrian\u2019s favorability level, wouldn\u2019t that save me if I ever run into a desperate moment? I don\u2019t think he\u2019d even get 5,000 EXP from killing me, but if his favorability points are high, wouldn\u2019t he at least\u00a0reconsider\u00a0killing me?Two favorability points compared to one, three compared to two. Wouldn\u2019t there be a greater chance that he\u2019d spare me if it\u2019s higher? That just might give me enough time to survive and find a way to get out of this game somehow\u2026I walked into that store. In front of the store owner who welcomed me so enthusiastically, I couldn\u2019t really open my mouth.In my head, I knew that I\u2019d have to work hard to raise those favorability points, but I don\u2019t exactly have much money now because I bought that high quality pillow.There\u2019s only one gold left in my wallet. I can\u2019t believe I have to spend the last of my money on an ordinary pencil\u2026When I return to my room later, I\u2019m pretty sure the daily wage I\u2019ll be getting is high enough, but I have no idea when exactly that system is going to play a sick prank on me again. And I can\u2019t exactly leave my money in a bank\u2026\u201cMiss, which item would you like to buy?\u201d\u201cO-O-O-One\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you feeling cold, Miss? You\u2019re shivering quite a lot.\u201d\u201cOne\u2026. o-or, or\u2026dina\u2026ry\u2026 pencil\u2026 please\u2026\u201dAs my jaw shook while my teeth chattered together, the store owner leaned forward and raised a hand to his ear.\u201cOne or\u2026dinary pencil.\u201dJust to say those three words, I had to muster up all the patience that should be beyond human standards. Only then did the store owner\u2019s face brighten because he finally understood words that sounded like human language.\u201cAha, so you mean one ordinary pencil. Please wait a moment. Would you like to have it gift wrapped?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Yes please. Maybe it\u2019ll get me more favorability points\u2026\u201d\u201cThe gift-wrapping service will cost 10 gold.\u201d\u201cNo,\u00a0no!\u00a0Cancel the gift-wrapping please. I\u2019ll do it myself!\u201d\u201cIs that so? Then, here you go.\u201dAfter hastily waving my hands to dissuade him, the subsequent misery poured in. My pitiful 1 gold, the number floating at the upper part of my field of view, then turned into a more pitiful 0 gold. Our dear lordship mister count, sir, please, help not the orphans and those stricken by poverty\u2014 I beg of you, please help those who are a little closer to you.I wasn\u2019t even in my right mind to know if it was still in the display cabinet or if I already bought it, but I left that store with one pencil in my hand. It\u2019s a pencil, but it\u2019s both a familiar and an unfamiliar item. I rarely ever used one since elementary school\u2026I rolled the pencil a few times on my palm, then unnecessarily gripped it tight.Staring at the 0 gold shining above my head, I felt wronged yet again. No, I mean, I don\u2019t have much money in the first place, but why should I get something for Adrian? He\u2019s a rich young nobleman while I\u2019m just a tenant living in his property!Besides, I worked like a dog just to earn that money, but didn\u2019t buying him a gift mean that he\u2019s just stealing my hard-earned salary back?\u201cJust what kind of\u00a0payback\u2026\u201d\u201cPay,\u00a0what?\u201d\u201cPayback, payback!\u00a0What kind of question even is\u2014\u201dWhile throwing back a question to\u00a0that\u00a0question, I was about to turn around in one quick motion, but then I stopped right there because of the familiar eyes that stared back at me.It felt like my tongue had been chopped off.I noticed too late that the siren indicating my perception skill, which was activated all this time, had gone bright red.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Hilda?\u201d\u201cA\u2026AHHH!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sure, you have skills now, but nobody ever said you can use them as you please.Translated by YonneeThe moment I saw those eyes, beautifully curved into two crescent moons, I literally shrieked and stumbled a few steps back.\u00a0Hiiiek, hiieeek\u2026\u00a0Loud gasps, almost to the point of suffocation, leaked through my open lips.When I desperately stepped back and tried to get away, my face probably entirely pale as though I had seen a ghost, the smile on Adrian\u2019s face was wiped off.His expression now was left with only a formal smile. He looked like a statue carved from wax\u2014handsome, but hard.\u201cSurprised?\u201d\u201cH-How come, here\u2026\u201d\u201cI startled you a lot. I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d\u201cB-B-B-Because you suddenly appeared like that\u2026\u201dThis jerk really is a devil, just popping out of thin air\u2026\u201cI\u2019m sorry for surprising you.\u201d\u201cHuh? N-No, it\u2019s alright. You don\u2019t have to apologize, Young Master.\u201dI got so flustered that I stammered again, not expecting that he would apologize. After cursing at him inwardly, I felt like I was too mean to him now. And really though, in this world, Adrian didn\u2019t need to apologize at all, even if I tripped and fell after he surprised me like that.\u300c You met Adrian for the first time out in a village. You gained 2,000 EXP. \u300dThe EXP bar filled up a lot today because of the critical hits, and now it reached level 9, around the middle of the bar, filling up until past the second half. I\u2019m so, so close to level 10 now.This reminded me of the time I managed to raise myself to level 4 with just the pure labor of weed pulling. Admiring my growth, tears welled up in my eyes.It\u2019s so difficult to raise my level like this, but there\u2019s not even any reward for every level in this garbage, flop game\u2026\u201cHilda?\u201dSlightly tilting his head to the side, Adrian stared at me. The sun\u2019s bright, golden rays streamed down over him and made him shine all glittery like a jewel.If I didn\u2019t know who he was, maybe green fields or even the innocent springtime would have flashed before my eyes. When looking at him like this, I couldn\u2019t help but somehow smell fragrant flowers from him.But that was just Adrian\u2019s shell. And it was all very poisonous.There\u2019s a snake within him. A snake that would flit out its forked tongue, biding its time while waiting for a chance to strike.\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that again?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just like I told you before, sir. It\u2019s because you\u2019re handsome. You\u2019re the same today as well.\u201d\u201cHandsome?\u201d\u201cAbsolutely. Seriously, Young Master, with that kind of face, you shouldn\u2019t even be smiling at anyone. Whenever you look at me, Young Master, it feels like all the light in the entire world is blinding my eyes.\u201dWhen I automatically complimented him again, the white letters appeared right on time.\u300c Adrian\u2019s favorability has risen by 1 point. \u300d\u300c Adrian\u2019s favorability : Lvl.1 (4/400) \u300d\u201cReally? I think so, too. But still, thank you.\u201dStill as ever, looks like you know exactly how handsome you are, huh. It\u2019s obvious that flattery was still also effective towards a boss. I wonder though. If I compliment him 100 times a day and wouldn\u2019t buy him any gifts, would this work smoothly enough and raise his favorability?\u201cHilda, you really show everything you\u2019re thinking of on your face, you know.\u201d\u201cHu\u2026uuuh? What do you mean\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s just. I\u2019m saying this because you really do look so innocent.\u201dHe\u2019s the one smiling so innocently like this, but he didn\u2019t look innocent at all.What the, so you know what I\u2019m thinking because it\u2019s all being shown on my face? I have no idea just how much this devil knew, or if he really meant what he said.I\u2019m someone who knows the game\u2019s backstories and scenarios, but I\u2019m getting all confused like this. It must be a piece of cake for him to fool the NPCs.But at the end of the day, the truth was harsh only towards those who knew.\u201cBy the way, what are you doing here in town, Hilda? You originally don\u2019t come all the way out here very often.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here to do some errands for the kitchen. But I wasn\u2019t actually asked to get this much.\u201d\u201cYeah, that looks heavy.\u201d\u201cI stopped by only a couple of stores, but it became like this in no time. People kept saying that it\u2019s because I\u2019m working at the Pfalzgraf household, that\u2019s why they gave me so much. All the people in this village just open up their store at the first mention of the Pfalzgraf family.\u201d\u201cOf course, since my father takes good care of this village since it\u2019s near the manor. House Pfalzgraf is famous for its charity for many generations.\u201d\u201cThe villagers didn\u2019t just praise His Lordship, but also you, Young Master. Everyone kept saying that you\u2019re like an angel who came down from the heavens\u2026\u201d\u201cAn angel, huh.\u201dWhen I mentioned that word, I tried to look closely at his expression, watching for any change at all. But frighteningly enough, nothing changed. It\u2019s like telling a dog\u2019s owner, \u2018Oh, what a cute cat you have there.\u2019Even so, it\u2019s only natural that he wouldn\u2019t let anything show. Because whatever people thought of him, he would still, in the end, kill.Uh, uuugh. I\u2019m getting scared again just thinking about it. I tried to step back inch by inch, but then something from the shadows came partly into view.Come to think of it, his hands were behind his back. What do you have there? Something that looks sharp\u2026?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I immediately turned pale and stumbled back again.\u201cW-W-What are you going to d-do with such a dangerous thing?\u201d\u201cThis? They\u2019re just ordinary garden shears though.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re dangerous. Those are such big scissors, so just one wrong move and you can cut your hand and bleed out and maybe bleed out to death or there\u2019s even the risk of infection and\u2014\u201d\u201cAre you worried about me?\u201dNo, not you. Me.\u201cO-Of course. Young Master, you must not be used to holding a tool like that, so I\u2019m just worried that you\u2019ll get hurt if you use it wrong\u2026 But may I ask, what are you going to use that for? Please, you can give it to me instead. I\u2019ll hold it for you.\u201dI was thinking about taking his weapon away from him before he\u2019d decide to stab me to death, but\u00a0fwick\u2014\u00a0he somehow dodged my hand.\u201cNo need. It\u2019s quite heavy, Hilda. I can\u2019t make you carry something heavy.\u201dThis jerk. I\u2019m sure he\u00a0knows\u00a0I\u2019m trying to steal his weapon. How could he even tell such a despicable lie with a gentle-looking face like that?\u201cNo, Young Master. It doesn\u2019t look heavy at all. Don\u2019t you see the shopping bag I\u2019m carrying now? I can carry it like this. It\u2019s really heavy, you know, but I\u2019m holding it really well. This body of mine is strong, so\u2026 Please hand it over!\u201d\u201cNo, Hilda. It\u2019s\u00a0very\u00a0heavy\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease give it to me. Hurry.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s heavy\u2026\u201d\u201cUgh, then carry this bag instead and just gimme!\u201d\u201cWait, you\u2019ll get hurt\u2026\u201dI absolutely can\u2019t die in a game like this!With single-minded determination, I practically flung the shopping bag at him and took the garden shears, which he tried to hide behind his back again. But the moment I got them off his hands, I almost jumped up and down in triumph.I got it! I got the murderer\u2019s weapon!\u201cHilda\u2026 Are you really so happy just to get those shears?\u201d\u201cOf course\u2026! Ack, Y-Young Master. I\u2019m so sorry. Are you alright?\u201dBelatedly realizing just\u00a0what\u00a0I had done, I almost stopped breathing. Crazy. As if it\u2019s not enough that I threw the bag straight at his chest, but I also dropped honorifics when I shouted! No matter how much I went out of my mind, I just went ahead and shortened my lifespan all on my own. Look at that begrudging look on his face! I\u2019m\u00a0dead. Was he boiling in so much rage now that he\u2019d come running at me?\u201cI apologize immensely. I was just so worried that you\u2019d get hurt, Young Master, that I\u2026\u201d\u201cI knew it. Hilda, you really are the only one who thinks of me.\u201dWhen Adrian said that, his expression was\u00a0not\u00a0good. Gulping once, I cowered. I have no idea how many peaks and valleys this day has given me.Was he really going to kill me this time? But even if he\u2019s decided to kill me, it\u2019ll be back in the manor, right?As expected, it was a good decision to take away the garden shears from him. The blades were so sharp that they\u2019d easily pierce through someone\u2019s stomach and even break their ribs. If he tries to kill me now, I can at least defend myself with this and escape somehow.\u201cI\u2019m really, really sorry. Please give me the shopping bag again. I\u2019ll carry everything.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s alright. It\u2019s really heavy, so I\u2019ll carry it.\u201d\u201cPlease just give it to me, your body\u2019s condition also isn\u2019t good\u2026\u201dThis, at least, was something I meant. No matter how cold-blooded of a devil he was inside, the shell he had was still the weak and sickly Adrian. If this much was already heavy for someone who had a firm, strong body that\u2019s like an experienced farmer\u2019s, then it would be that much heavier for him.I worried about him like that, but Adrian flatly refused.\u201cNo, Hilda. I\u2019ll carry this, so you just hold onto the garden shears. But once you take it safely back to the manor, you\u2019ll give it back to me then, right?\u201d\u201cYes, of course. Once I return to the manor, I\u2019ll return it and even deliver it to you in your room, Young Master.\u201dReturn? No way. I\u2019m going to bring this back to the manor and bury it somewhere deep in the garden.If he\u2019s really going to use this to kill people, then it would be trouble no matter who he\u2019d decide to target.I heard that the act of murder was addicting. Would closing the windows like this stop the flood? He\u2019s only killing people out of necessity to regain his strength, but if he starts killing in earnest, then I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019ll be my turn soon enough.If I don\u2019t want to die, maybe the path to survival is to make sure that other people stay alive, too.This was the conclusion I ended up with.Still, if it\u2019s really inevitable, at least let my turn be the last\u2026\u201cBut Young Master, why do you need this? They\u2019re garden shears, but\u2026\u201d\u201cMy Mother\u2019s condition seems to be worse off these days, so I was going to trim the garden that she often goes to. We planted citrus trees together there when I was young. I thought it would comfort her a little if I planted something small and tidy up the garden a bit.\u201dWhen asked the question, a surprisingly human answer came back. The story was so detailed and intricate, and his expression looked kinda affectionate too, so it almost felt real.Are you just\u2026 acting?

Sure, you have skills now, but nobody ever said you can use them as you please.Translated by Yonnee\u201cThen please feel free to let me or Miss Leticia know. Young Master, you don\u2019t have to come out yourself just to trim the garden. All you have to do is tell us how to trim and decorate the garden, and we\u2019ll take it from there. Why do this when you can just sit back comfortably, sir?\u201d\u201cSo.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019ll do everything I ask you to? But then I won\u2019t have anything left to do for Mother.\u201d\u201cF-For real?\u201dWhat the. My lips answered automatically because I didn\u2019t expect his answer. He\u2019s Satan, but did he still love the countess because she was the person who gave birth to him? But that doesn\u2019t add up.In the game, even the count and the countess were Adrian\u2019s kill targets. Or maybe\u2026 Was he planning to lure the countess to the garden, by the citrus tree, then brutally kill her there?Yeah, that sounds more believable. This devil right here couldn\u2019t possibly feel any human affection.\u201cBut Hilda, are you going somewhere else? I don\u2019t think there are any more shops on this street.\u201dI was about to go see the neighborhood patrol of this town and ask them about the recent murders, dear young master. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the one who did it, but if they were looking for evidence or witnesses, I thought I\u2019d join the witness protection program, \u2018s\u2019all.I couldn\u2019t say all this honestly, now could I, so I turned around with my back to the neighborhood patrol headquarters and pointed at some other random place.\u201cUm, there\u2026 No, over there?\u201d\u201cThat place\u2026 is a dead end, Hilda.\u201dGosh. Looks like he knows this village well enough.I looked elsewhere and tried to make a rough guess, but time passed and I still couldn\u2019t find anything. Somehow, his gaze was persistent on me, so I let out a deep sigh, acting as if I had no other choice but to say this.\u201cYes, I lied, actually. I wasn\u2019t really going that direction, but it\u2019s because I stopped by the stationary store for a bit. Because of you, Young Master.\u201d\u201cBecause of me?\u201d\u201cYes. Young Master, if you were to receive a gift, what kind of gift would you like the most?\u201dRather than just looking around, waiting for the notification that would say, \u300c Adrian likes this item \u300d it\u2019d be much better to just ask the guy directly. As long as it\u2019s an item he actually likes, if I throw something like that at him, then I\u2019m sure that his favorability points would go up, too.\u201cWill you buy it for me?\u201d\u201cUm, well, it depends on the, um, budget, so I guess\u2026 maybe\u2026 or maybe not\u2026\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s from Hilda, I\u2019ll be happy to receive anything.\u201dWhen Adrian said this, he gave much emphasis on the name \u2018Hilda\u2019. I guess he really wants to receive something, huh. Maybe this is also how the count\u2019s household maintains its riches.I heard that the richer you are, the more\u2026 well\u2026\u201cHere, I thought you\u2019d like this, so I bought it.\u201dWith a trembling hand, I took the pencil out of my pocket. It\u2019s quite literally something I bought with my entire fortune, but what was I doing, giving it away without getting anything in return.No matter what kind of game it was, I used to play until the maximum level without having to shell out any cash. But why do I keep getting ripped off here? It felt like I was in a constant losing battle against the game system.I don\u2019t want to give it to him. I want to take it back to the store and ask for a refund. I want to safeguard my money, even if it\u2019s just 1 gold\u2026When I said that it\u2019s for him, I felt my face twitch, starting from my lips.\u201cYou\u2019re giving this to me?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dTo be more exact, I\u2019m only giving it to you to raise your favorability. If that shoots up, then so do my chances of surviving and living a cushy life.\u201cThis pencil looks like it\u2019s easy and convenient to use. Thank you very much, Hilda. I\u2019ll use it a lot.\u201dBut what if the points don\u2019t go up that much? Then I\u2019ll just have to abandon the plan to raise his favorability. If it\u2019s not going to be very efficient\u2026\u300c You gifted Adrian an \u2018ordinary pencil\u2019. \u300d\u300c Adrian is delighted. \u300d\u300c Adrian\u2019s favorability has risen by 30 points. \u300d\u300c Adrian\u2019s favorability : Lvl.1 (34/400) \u300dHm. 30 points for 1 gold is quite the bargain. If I just flatter him a few times a day while throwing a pencil at him at the same time, I might be able to raise his favorability pretty fast.He only received a shabby pencil, but Adrian smiled so brightly that even the person looking at him became delighted.But for some reason, there was a certain image overlapping his figure right now. The one I saw at the game\u2019s title screen\u2014the one that seemed like Diablo\u2019s fiery pit.I managed to raise your favorability points, but why does it look like your smile became even more menacing\u2026?The moment I saw that expression, I was thrown into agony once more. Is it really a good idea to get the devil to like me?Of course, indifference was surely the best, but I had to exclude that route because I messed that one up early on. In the first place, didn\u2019t I ruin everything from the very beginning while I was supposed to be the maid who\u2019s in charge of Adrian\u2019s meds?\u201cThen, are you finished with your errands here?\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master. I bought everything already, so I was on my way back.\u201dI looked around again and tried to memorize the way to the neighborhood patrol headquarters that was not too far away from here. I\u2019m gonna need to go there later. I need to pay a visit and talk to Inspector Harrison.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNovel InfoNovel Info",
