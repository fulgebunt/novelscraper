Amongst a sea of clouds. The Wind and Thunder Platform. A single piece of sky.Here, was the Continent of The Nine Heavens. The Three Higher Heavens. An extremely perilous area, the Wind and Thunder Platform!Whilst on it, one could reach for the winds and thunder, and its only exit was the single piece of sky!However, at that moment, there was instead nothing but foul wind and a fog of misery on the Wind and Thunder Platform!\u201cChu Yang, hand over the Nine Tribulations Sword! We will spare you from death!\u201d\u201cChu Yang, you are already on the verge of death, just hand over the Nine Tribulations Sword. The others and I can leave you a complete corpse!\u201d\u201cChu Yang, the Nine Tribulations Sword, such a godly item that is ranked first under the Heavens, is completely wasted in your hands. How many years has it been that you have shown no improvement? That heavenly item is absolutely wasted on you! Just hand it over.\u201dShouts of clamouring voices came from all directions.At the center of the Wind and Thunder Platform was a slightly protruding piece of large rock. On that rock, Chu Yang was wearing a black piece of shirt. His entire body was bathed in blood, and his hair loosely dishevelled. However, his face appeared unconcerned, and his eyes remained cool and collected like a piece of rock! His body \u2014 Upright and straight like a spear!Similar to the sword within his hand, he was filled with an unyielding intent!Even though he was already mortally wounded!Beneath his feet, within a radius of several hundred zhang, there were countless limbs and body pieces that were dripping with blood.He looked at the surrounding group of experts who were only shouting, but were not rushing over. Chu Yang\u2019s face revealed the hint of a cynical smile, filled with arrogance and disdain!Faced against that sea of experts, even though he was completely surrounded with no means of escape, his haughtiness still continued to soar!Those people were all aware of the situation. They knew that he was already on his last legs, but none dared to approach. When faced against an attack that would cause them both to perish together, no one was willing to become that scapegoat. They could only hope that someone who sought death would blindly charge in, but no one was stupid enough to do so. That was why, at that moment, they had unanimously stopped their advance and stayed their hands.That kind of people, with that kind of mentality, even if their levels of martial cultivation were higher, even if their numbers were to increase; Even if they could kill me ten thousand times, they were also not worthy of being my enemies!Chu Yang continued to smile cynically, then slowly began to sit down. The expression on his face remained indifferent, and his lips continued to remain silent. However, instead, his mind was filled with doubt.How did the matter regarding the Nine Tribulations Sword being in his possession got disclosed out?He had clearly investigated for a total of three years before ascertaining that there was a fragment which belonged to the Ninth Tribulation Sword within the Wind and Thunder Platform at the Three Higher Heavens. After spending untold hardships, he had finally found a chance and risked a gamble that had a one in ten chance of survival to arrive at the Three Higher Heavens. However, why did he encounter such a massive ambush after his arrival there?On that day, it was only the fifth day since he had entered the Three Higher Heavens! Moreover, he encountered that ambush at the moment when he had just found the Wind and Thunder Platform!On that day, the only result would be the result of his death!He was all along famous for his secretive whereabouts, so who knew his plans?He had continuously charged forward for more than ten times, but he was blocked and pushed back every single time! Meanwhile, all of the places that he had chosen became dead ends! According to common sense, there was absolutely no reason for him to be unable to charge a path out!Who was the person who understood his habits to such a degree? Who was that secret enemy?That question had already puzzled Chu Yang for a long time.The blade of the Nine Tribulations Sword flashed and reflected the sun\u2019s rays from the sky above, painting a rainbow in the middle of the air. Everyone who witnessed that scene felt their desires burning, and could not wait to have that godly item in their grasp.Higher Ancient Godly Item! A godly item that was ranked first on the Continent of The Nine Heavens!Whoever obtained the Nine Tribulations Sword would be invincible under the Heavens! That \u2018being invincible under the Heavens\u2019 was the huge secret within the Nine Tribulations Sword! According to legends, the power of the Nine Tribulations Sword was not only limited to that.Nine Tribulations of The Nine Heavens, a single sword to destroy the world; To reign supreme for a thousand autumns until eternity, exceeding the Heavens beyond The Nine Heavens!That was the only sentence of the ballad passed down throughout the world regarding the Nine Tribulations Sword. Its origins could no longer be traced. The Nine Tribulations Sword had always been only a legend. No one expected that the Nine Tribulations Sword would one day actually appear right before them.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Chu Yang also had a doubt. The Nine Tribulations Sword. Correct, he had obtained the Nine Tribulations Sword. Moreover, step by step, he had found five fragments of the sword. However, to his disappointment, he had also discovered that the power of the Nine Tribulations Sword was also not as great as he had imagined! Furthermore, there was always a clear gap between the Nine Tribulations Sword and him. No matter if he had poured fresh blood over it, or how much he attempted to perceive it through sincerity, there was not even the slightest effect. Why was that so?Why? Why?!His utmost emotions, the pinnacle sword! He had destroyed his emotions and immersed in the sword, then from the Way of the Sword immersed in the Way of Martial Arts, and from the Way of Martial Arts sought the Way of the Heavens. The price he paid was a life of loneliness, and he led a life filled with killing as his believed way of life. Unfortunately, in the end, he still did not manage to master the Nine Tribulations Sword, and therefore did not manage to master the Art of The Nine Heavens!!Was the choice he made wrong? Or was that path definitely a mistake? Or could it be said\u2026\u2026 that his lack of emotions was still insufficient to satisfy the Nine Tribulations Sword?Emotionless swordsman, emotionless swordsman, if a swordsman had emotions, how could he still be considered a swordsman? The Way of the Sword, the Way of Martial Arts, the Way of the Heavens, they all lacked emotions in the end\u2026\u2026 However, why were his emotions wavering at the current moment between life and death?Nine Tribulations Sword, ah, Nine Tribulations Sword, what exactly is your secret?!Looking at the surrounding stares of greediness towards the Nine Tribulations Sword, Chu Yang secretly gave a bitter laugh. All of you only knew that obtaining this Nine Tribulations Sword would make you invincible under the Heavens, but do all of you know how much have I sacrificed for this Nine Tribulations Sword?I have already nothing left.The red and graceful figure of a person seemed to flash within his mind, and it became clearer and clearer. Slowly, a pair of red sleeves were raised lightly and swayed. From somewhere, a fleeting music seemed to begin playing, while that lithe and graceful figure slowly began to dance amidst the dreamlike surroundings\u2026\u2026The focus in Chu Yang\u2019s eyes suddenly became distant with a sense of loss, filled with sorrow\u2026\u2026Fresh blood flowed, and Chu Yang clearly felt his own life quickly slipping away. He had pursued Martial Arts all his life. Going into a relationship, breaking a relationship, getting out of a relationship, as well as destroying his emotions after becoming emotionless. At that very moment, on the verge of his death, he had originally thought that his only regret should be that he did not achieve the martial domain level of supremacy that he pursued all his life, while he was alive. However, what he had never thought was, at that moment, that very point of time, a figure he originally thought that he had long since forgotten, had instead actually appeared within his mind\u2019s consciousness.Ah, that beautiful figure clad in luxurious and fluttering red clothes, that turning to look back, the curl of that body\u2026\u2026 those were all excellent expressions. Lightly, nimbly, and gracefully, his mind began to sing and dance. Every single time the figure turned back to look at him, that gaze carried with it passion that was as deep as the sea.Mo Qing Wu, the woman who had caused Chu Yang to enter into a relationship, as well as breaking that relationship!\u201cSo, I never did really break that relationship\u2026\u2026\u201d Chu Yang muttered to himself, the edges of his mouth revealed the hint of a self-deprecating smile.In his mind, a hint of remorse quietly began to diffuse. Like smoke, it immediately engulfed his entire soul.At that very moment, he could no longer control his mind, nor did he also want to control it\u2026\u2026Qing Wu! If I were to head to the netherworld now, would it be possible to meet up with you?Qing Wu, did you know, when I had initially practised the Three Tribulations of Emotional Destruction Slash to leave you, how much had I regretted that\u2026\u2026Chu Yang\u2019s mind was filled with a sour sense of loss\u2026\u2026\u201cEverybody attack together! Completely chop him up! As for the Nine Tribulations Sword, it will not be too late for us to slowly negotiate later!\u201d One man gave a loud shout. \u201cOtherwise, if he is given time to recover, it will become our turn to suffer a huge loss!\u201dFrom the surroundings, the large crowd of people gave loud shouts of agreement, then immediately raised their swords and sabres as one, and moved towards Chu Yang while surrounding him.Chu Yang remained sitting in a trance, unmoving, the gaze of his eyes seemed to be looking at somewhere else ahead of him. As if filled with a deep sense of bleakness that had remained unchanged since ancient times, the strands of hair that were stained with blood floated before his forehead\u2026\u2026The dance of that person within his mind\u2019s consciousness became even more intense, and had already become a group of red shadows, indefinitely fleeting, but were instead weaving a boundless sky of red silk. At the same time, a graceful and dreary voice slowly began singing from amidst the red shadows\u2026\u2026\u201cA lifetime is not a gentle dance,a dance is a lifetime of bitterness;I will dance for you in this lifetime,bitter or not I will dance a lifetime!\u201d\u2026\u2026That was her pledge of love, a little poem that Mo Qing Wu had created. He could still remember that moment when Mo Qing Wu had tears in her eyes, her gaze filled with melancholy and resentment. She\u2026\u2026 had long knew that he had made use of her emotions to practise his martial skills. However, like moths drawn to a flame, she had instead thrown herself into his arms, and had allowed him to burn as he pleased!Ah, that girl of pure heart and spirit\u2026\u2026 As Chu Yang wistfully thought of her, his heart could not help but feel sour. At the very end of his life, did he only know the preciousness of true feelings\u2026\u2026 but for himself, he could no longer turn back\u2026\u2026He could still remember, that final time when Mo Qing Wu was rejected by him. With a wounded heart and broken spirit, in a distracted state of restlessness, there was an attack on her way back home, and the young woman of peerless beauty finally passed away like a diminishing fragrance.When he received the news and had immediately rushed over, he was still a single step too late at the very end. Although he had later killed the entire family of the people who had harmed Mo Qing Wu, not sparing even the nine generations of that clan\u2019s chickens and dogs, the beautiful girl could not come back to life!At the moment before her death, that woman of peerless beauty had gently laid in his arms. She had said to him, \u201cChu Yang, should there be another life\u2026\u2026 should I meet you once more, I hope that you will carefully\u2026\u2026 take a look at me. I look nicer than a sword!\u201d\u201cChu Yang, to be able to die in your arms, I am very satisfied\u2026\u2026\u201d Those were the last words of Mo Qing Wu\u2026\u2026Qing Wu, you were not satisfied. You had regrets. Otherwise, why would you have tears at the corners of your eyes? On the face of the beautiful girl who had already taken her last breath, two clear droplets of tears suddenly dropped\u2026\u2026 She had forcibly pretended to put on a smile on her deathbed, afraid that he would be hurt\u2026\u2026 that was how wretched\u2026\u2026Two droplets of clear tears, had instead at that very moment smashed and shattered his heart! From then on, his heart would be covered in dust!Drifting lightly like a dream,Demons danced in a sea of blood and on a mountain of bones;A gentleman does not question the warring swords within a thousand Li,Together forever through Life and Death unto the Highest Heaven!That was a poem specially created by Xue Lei Han, the gifted scholar who was then ranked first under the Heavens, in response to the deep feelings Mo Qing Wu had for Chu Yang.While at the moment, Qing Wu, you have already arrived at the Highest Heaven, yet I instead remain in the Mortal Realm\u2026\u2026 but, I am soon able to be with you together forever through Life and Death\u2026\u2026 through generations after generations!Chu Yang was lost in his thoughts, and the usually cold and hardened edges of his lips displayed the hint of a warm and gentle, tragic smile. The hair that was stained with blood began to float amongst the wind\u2026\u2026Qing Wu, wait for me!Qing Wu, did you know, should there be another life, I\u2019d rather not practise whatever Way of the Sword, rather not want to be at whatever pinnacle, rather not have revenge, and would rather be with you! In this world, was there anything worth that satisfied smile of yours? No!The graceful dance and songs within his mind\u2019s consciousness became increasingly distant, and Mo Qing Wu\u2019s voice seemed to also become increasingly fleeting. \u201cI will dance for you in this lifetime\u2026\u2026 I will dance for you through the generations\u2026\u2026 Even if my heart is bent a thousand times, it will never change\u2026\u2026 Even if I were to die ten thousand times, I will not feel bitter\u2026\u2026 not feel bitter\u2026\u2026\u201d*Shua* A golden blade cut through the wind and came towards him from the front. Whilst still in a trance, Chu Yang casually blocked with his sword. His mind was still listening to Mo Qing Wu\u2019s voice from somewhere\u2026\u2026 This life is already ending. Ah, Qing Wu, before my death, let me hear more of your voice\u2026\u2026Not bitter\u2026\u2026 Qing Wu, you were bitter, but instead did not feel bitter. At this moment\u2026\u2026 I am very bitter! Filled with regret!The number of sabres and swords added to the bodies became more and more, fresh blood flew little by little, and bit by bit, pain began to focus on the various parts of his entire body. Finally, the songs and dance within the mind\u2019s consciousness had been broken!Chu Yang furiously gave a long shout! He suddenly stood up, his long, black coloured hair rose and flew about intensely! His hair-band broke! He began to rage hysterically!Even at the final moments of my life, all of you came to interrupt our reunion! You all deserve to die!*Peng* A sword pierced through Chu Yang\u2019s chest. Chu Yang felt a momentary pain, and lowered his head to take a look. *Pa* The piece of jade pendant that hung around his neck shattered before his eyes. At the center of the jade pendant, a single \u201cWu\u201d character quietly began to break into pieces\u2026\u2026Chu Yang blankly reached out a hand to touch, his hand grabbing fragments. All of a sudden, he became extremely furious!Ah, that was the only keepsake Qing Wu had left for him!\u201cKill!\u201d Chu Yang suddenly rose his head, the intent to kill wildly surged within his eyes. With a crazed shout, the Nine Tribulations Sword within his hand suddenly waved, giving off ten thousand rays of light. It was as if lightning from The Nine Heavens had suddenly chained to form a waist-band of light!*Pengpengpangpang* The sounds momentarily rang out, and all the weapons that were surrounding near him had a length neatly cut off!Everyone hurriedly retreated back and frightfully looked at the tidy circle of weapons that were cut into half beneath Chu Yang\u2019s feet. Cold sweat oozed and dripped down their backs. They had never thought that the power of a single attack from the Nine Tribulations Sword would actually be that horrifying!They had originally thought that Chu Yang was already close to death, convinced that it was exactly the moment to be daring. Every single person was secretly planning, that after Chu Yang\u2019s death, how should they handle the Nine Tribulations Sword? How would they seize it? If it had fallen into their own hands, how would they escape? Just as every single person was urgently contemplating countermeasures, Chu Yang had instead suddenly raised his sword! Moreover, its power had been that great!That was greatly beyond their expectations!Chu Yang\u2019s body was bathed in blood, and he was wielding his sword while standing upright. His eyes watched the group of people before him with a gaze as cold as ice, looking over them one by one. No matter whose face his gaze rested on, that person\u2019s entire body would uncontrollably tremble momentarily.Within those pair of eyes, they only felt endless grief, endless despair, endless rage, and\u2026\u2026 endless killing intent!After Chu Yang had looked an entire round, he suddenly questioned in a soft voice, \u201cAll of you want the Nine Tribulations Sword?\u201dNot waiting for anyone\u2019s answer, he began to give a cold and stern laugh, and said, \u201cAll right! I will let all of you take a look at the Nine Tribulations Sword!\u201dSuddenly, he gave an abrupt leap!He had already suffered countless fatal injuries, yet he actually leapt! In the middle of the air, blood from the wounds all over his entire body danced like a whirlwind and splattered about, but he was instead indifferent. With a grave facial expression, he gave a cold shout.\u201cNine Tribulations Sword, a few rays of chilling light illuminates ten thousand zhang!\u201dThe Nine Tribulations Sword waved. Like a bolt of unfurling white silk, a single ray of white light changed into an arc and shot out! Following behind the arc, ten million rays of chilling light surged forth! Those ten million rays of chilling light seemed to bring with them the Heavens and Earth\u2019s most ancient desolation\u2026\u2026Nine Tribulations Sword! Sword techniques of The Nine Heavens! The First Sword!The Nine Heavens, was the name of that continent. Since history, of all the sword techniques, none had ever dared to use those three words as its name. However, that Nine Tribulations Sword\u2019s sword techniques instead, directly used the name \u201cThe Nine Heavens\u201d!Throughout the ages, those sword techniques were the only set!Although Chu Yang could not exactly exert the true power of the Nine Tribulations Sword\u2019s sword techniques, he had already perceived those few sword techniques for a very long time. The powers of those few sword techniques might not be as great as he had imagined, but they also exceeded all worldly sword techniques.The surrounding several tens of experts instinctively knew that sword technique was nothing trivial, and could not help but brought forth their treasured abilities, endeavouring to withstand against that single attack! The bodies of every single person shook, and they all felt that they could almost no longer hold onto their weapons steadily.\u201cNine Tribulations Sword, why not kill all under the Heavens!\u201dThe first stroke was unfinished, yet the second stroke had already descended murderously! The surging rays of light was like a rising tide of the sea, boundless killing intent spread across the skies and covered the earth, violently shooting out! Miserable screams rang out. Ten or so experts, who could each individually dominate an entire place, had all tried their utmost to resist, but instead still had their entire bodies splattered with blood, and awkwardly retreated!At that moment, every single person had a misconception: The Chu Yang of that moment was absolutely uninjured! He was definitely at his peak condition!They instead did not know, that they had interrupted Chu Yang\u2019s memories and broken Mo Qing Wu\u2019s song and dance, making Chu Yang completely furious, thoroughly exerting forth his entire body\u2019s potential! That was the strength of life, wrath of the soul! That strength even exceeded when he was in his prime condition by far!\u201cNine Tribulations Sword, majesty is a single gathering of wind and clouds!\u201dChu Yang wickedly gave a loud laugh. Amidst the waving movements of the Nine Tribulations Sword, a huge majestic crown actually seemed to appear! Its magnificent sense of pressure spread across the skies and covered the earth! From the sword, wherever rays of light had pointed, miserable screams would be heard in succession, and arrows of blood flew. One by one, the heads of people tumbled down from their necks, as if a cart of rotten watermelons had been knocked over\u2026\u2026With the descent of a conqueror, common people under the Heavens will be slaughtered by me as I please! Following my whims, I take and destroy!\u201cNine Tribulations Sword! Sever the overwhelming emotions of the guest in the Mortal World!\u201d\u201cNine Tribulations Sword! An everlasting fragrance from a mountain of corpses and sea of blood!\u201dWith those three strokes in succession, the surface of the ground that had been dyed red with fresh blood once again became a slaughterhouse of an Asura! Without any exception, all of those several tens of people who had surrounded and attacked, were completely lying within the pool of blood!Chu Yang staggered and fell! He arrogantly gazed at the surroundings with disdain. Looking at the several tens of zhang around him, there was already no one left standing! Those who were once experts, those who were once brilliant and glorious, before the Nine Tribulations Sword\u2019s peerless powers under the Heavens and Earth, they had completely become numerous corpses on the ground!To think of wanting the Nine Tribulations Sword? Are all of you\u2026\u2026 even worthy?!However, after that outburst, Chu Yang was also already, completely, close to death!\u201cQing Wu, no matter if it is in the Heavens or on the Mortal Realm, who can obstruct our meeting?!\u201d Supported by his sword, he stood up and gasped for breath, while taking a short respite. His eyes were instead lightly closed. He was looking forward to once again seeing those songs and dance within his mind\u2019s consciousness. However, they were not there!Chu Yang suddenly opened his eyes, and gave a low growl, \u201cWhy? Why are you not there? Qing Wu\u2026\u2026\u201dAfar, from three different directions, three rays of light soared at the same time, and took the form of three golden coloured silhouettes in the air! Magnificently dazzling, they carried with them a violent presence that was overwhelming powerful and arrogant.Phantoms of golden light, kings of their designated areas!Those three golden coloured silhouettes represented that three Martial Artist Kings had made an appearance!Chu Yang\u2019s pupils shrunk, and he gave a bitter laugh while looking powerlessly at the three golden coloured silhouettes in the air, his heart completely as cold as ice. He had never thought, that his opponent\u2019s true killing stroke would only come out until that very moment!He was only a Revered Martial Artist, and was only one level away from King Rank. However, that one level, was instead no different from the distance between the Heavens and Earth!Three Martial Artist Kings, what a large involvement!\u201cWhat good swordsmanship, definitely worth of being the Poisonous Sword Revered Martial Artist! However, this Three Higher Heavens is instead not the place where you, a mere Poisonous Sword Revered Martial Artist, can behave atrociously!\u201d One of the men said gently, \u201cIt is just a pity that I am unable to fight a fair battle with you. What a deep regret!\u201dFollowing that speech, the remaining two people appeared together. Those three people were all dressed in wide robes with large sleeves, those sleeves fluttering along with the wind. Their attitudes were elegant and smart, and their facial expressions were calm.Chu Yang\u2019s gaze was already a little blurred. \u201cThree of you Martial Artist Kings\u2026\u2026 also think of wanting the Nine Tribulations Sword?\u201d\u201cWrong, we are not exactly thinking of wanting the Nine Tribulations Sword. Instead, we are thinking to let you die!\u201d Those three people gave a slight smile at the same time, their attitudes serious. \u201cHowever, incidentally taking the Nine Tribulations Sword can also be considered as an unexpected harvest. A large harvest!\u201dChu Yang momentarily gave a cold and arrogant smile. He straightened his spine, and arrogantly said, \u201cIt is only a pity that all of you do not understand the Nine Tribulations Sword! All of you will never obtain it!\u201dHis gaze changed and became decisive, absolute and natural!At that moment, he already did not have the strength for another battle!However, instead, he could still issue forth one final attack! Destroy!Destroy himself, destroy the Nine Tribulations Sword! Destroy the enemies!The sword gave off a glint of light. Chu Yang had violently reversed the Nine Tribulations Sword, and violently thrust it into his own heart! With a pair of emotionless eyes looking at the three people in the air, he shouted, \u201cWith the blood of my heart, ten thousand tribulations will collapse! As master of the Nine Tribulations Sword, all opposites will transpose!\u201dThat was the only sword technique which he was able to completely exert the full power of the sword. When he had initially seen the sword verse, he just knew that was the only one sword technique that he was able to perform. However, that kind of sword technique, instead required him to use his own life to initiate!That kind of sword technique, who would dare to use?When that sword technique was used, the person performing it would die!The Nine Tribulations Sword suddenly began to flare violently, and it was as if a sun had appeared in the middle of the air. Keen sword energy suddenly burst forth violently. That wild and fierce energy had actually launched Chu Yang\u2019s entire body into the middle of the air!That was the ultimate move of the Nine Tribulations Sword! To use the blood of his own heart and to sacrifice his soul, then excite the sword\u2019s soul! However, that was still the absolute move to perish together with the enemy! That one move was even capable of executing opponents that were a long stronger than him by a few levels!That was still the Nine Tribulations Sword\u2019s Soul independently killing people, destroying everything!\u201cBack!\u201d Those three Martial Artist Kings were extremely shocked, and they rapidly fled towards the outside! Compared to the calm expression that they had during the time when they had arrived, it was a huge difference! Those graceful, elegant and smart bearings had long since disappeared without leaving any trace!They had never expected, that Poisonous Sword Revered Martial Artist would actually be capable of stimulating that one move!*Hong* A brilliant and incandescent ray of light emanated from the sword rose into the sky, reflecting throughout the entire sky and changing it into a silver-white colour!Those three Martial Artist Kings, as if they did not even have the time to take their stances, nor even the time to issue forth their miserable screams, were simply destroyed and turned into smoke and flying dust!Moreover, even the golden silhouettes that were formed from their King Ranked energies still remained flashing in the air. However, their lives, had instead already became nothingness!That one attack from the Nine Tribulations Sword\u2019s Sword Soul had, within the range of its energy, even directly destroyed the Heavens and Earth, not to mention only three Martial Artist Kings.Chu Yang suddenly felt quite humorous, and unintentionally gave a bitter smile. Unless, the secret behind the invincibility of that Nine Tribulations Sword was that? Then, what value did the godly item that was ranked first on the continent still have?However, he vaguely felt that it should not be such. Yet, he already did not have the chance to unearth the true secret behind the Nine Tribulations Sword\u2026\u2026Chu Yang gave an audible sigh. While his body was still in the middle of the air, his eyes momentarily skimmed at random, and instead discovered someone whom he believed should absolutely not have appeared there.From afar, a single man in white clothes was looking with astonishment at his direction, his face completely filled with disbelief.\u201cMo Tian Ji!?\u201d Chu Yang\u2019s gaze momentarily straightened, and he finally understood. Why was his secretive movements actually ambushed by people, why was his every attack carefully intercepted by people!No wonder. It was him. God of the Abacus and the Ghost of Calculations, Mo Tian Ji.It was no wonder that he had suffered such a crushing defeat!Chu Yang thought of giving a miserable laugh, thought of ridiculing himself, thought of\u2026\u2026 However, in the end, he did not do anything. He had already lost all of his strength, and he was also too late to consider\u2026\u2026Chu Yang\u2019s body gradually dropped from the sky, gradually fell downwards, and like a drifting dead leaf during late autumn, fell onto the dirt. His face carried a faint but warm smile, and muttered, \u201cQing Wu, should there be another life, we will dance under the Heavens!\u201dSince he could not avoid death, then with his greatest passion and deepest yearning, he would embrace death! That was because, over there, waited his beloved!From somewhere, snow fell and swirled from the wide skies, while the very earth was dressed and wrapped in silver. Seemingly on a boundless piece of ground covered with pure-white snow, a graceful and red coloured figure began to dance lightly, as if welcoming him, and also as if she was anxious for Chu Yang. Her face could not be seen clearly, but that gently bound gaze which was free from regret and resentment, and filled with deep passion, was instead very clear\u2026\u2026 Those dance movements were graceful, becoming increasingly intense, and the highest level of the Heavens and deepest recess of the Earth continuously danced, but they were all actually melancholic and cold like fresh blood\u2026\u2026Somewhere near Chu Yang\u2019s heart, the tip of the Nine Tribulations Sword suddenly gave off a dazzling radiance, and it was actually, magnificently dazzling for people to behold!Chu Yang, with his eyes already closed, seemed to hear a fleeting voice from somewhere, carrying with it weariness and joy, as if it had waited with a kind of heavy burden for thousands of years. In a low tone, it seemed to have said, \u201c\u2026\u2026The Nine Tribulations have become empty, life and death are still calm; The blue skies can still be mended, why should you look forward to a next life\u2026 Ai, it finally came\u2026\u2026\u201dWithin that voice, those short twenty-eight words actually seemed as if they had experienced countless drastic changes, as if those changes had always been kept beyond its reach\u2026\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThen, from the location of his heart, a dazzling radiance shot out and rose from the ground.

People who saw that scene widened their eyes as if they were blind!However, with just that single flash, it directly soared towards the Highest Heaven, then instantly disappearing without a shadow or any trace\u2026\u2026On the Wind and Thunder Platform, the winds whimpered, as if weeping and complaining, as if they still repeated that one sentence which Chu Yang had said \u2014 Should there be another life\u2026\u2026 should there be another life\u2026\u2026 we, will, dance, under, the, Heavens\u2026\u2026[Rylain\u2019s Translator Notes:1.

He still had not opened his eyes, yet he gave a painful and heartfelt cry. He felt his own heart twitching, that it ached, but its sound was weak as if it was groaning, and it was as if he could not even hear it\u2026\u2026After those words had left his mouth, Chu Yang was instead momentarily stunned!I\u2026\u2026 had clearly seen Qing Wu coming to receive me, that familiar and pleasant smile, those tender emotions that had already seeped into the bone marrow\u2026\u2026Yet\u2026\u2026 what is this?Before his eyes, there were unlimited mountain rocks, and at the skyline, the setting sun was like blood. Swaying and rustling green bamboos were in all directions, as if causing the horizon\u2019s purple evening glow to whirl, rippling amongst the breeze, rising one wave at a time\u2026\u2026Beside his legs, there was still a patch of blood.A severe pain was sent from the top of his head, and he reached out a hand to touch it. The entire hand was a complete dark red.That mountain, that rock, that scenery, that wound, they were actually that familiar!Where is this place?A voice beside his ear, carrying with it a tone that seemed as if it was about to cry, said, \u201cHey\u2026\u2026 please\u2026\u2026 please don\u2019t scare me, I, I\u2026\u2026 I am such a handsome and dashing person, ah, I cannot take scares\u2026\u2026\u201dChu Yang was secretly, momentarily confused. He thought, Unless, I really still have not died? However, who is this guy shouting beside my ear? He really is quite of the finest grade. Clearly, he is about to be scared to death, but he actually still has not forgotten to be narcissistic\u2026\u2026When it seemed that he did not get any response, that person once again cried out, \u201cReally\u2026\u2026 no longer breathing? Wu\u2026\u2026\u201d That crying sound was instead like a train\u2019s whistle. If someone from afar was to hear it, he or she would definitely think that there was a hungry wolf howling *Ao~~~*.The sound lasted long and loud, and it reverberated melodiously. There was actually a faint echo. It was just that the echo instead became *Ao~~~* \u2026\u2026Really talented. Chu Yang secretly thought. He could also tell from hearing it. That sound was absolutely filled with fright and sorrow, and it could not be faked; However, that sound\u2026\u2026 really made it hard for people to boast.It was as if the Heavens had made a mistake when creating him, and had used a duck\u2019s throat on his body instead. Moreover, it was also a drake\u2026\u2026Probably, upon completion, the Heavens once again felt that something was not quite right, and had therefore made a compensation \u2014 By also borrowing half the throat of a wolf\u2026\u2026That sound, ah, seemed quite familiar\u2026\u2026 That kind of sound was absolutely too unique! Chu Yang felt his heart shudder momentarily, and memories from long ago suddenly rushed into his mental consciousness\u2026\u2026\u201cIt was only just practising rod techniques, there is no need for you to be knocked dead by me in a single strike just like this right?\u201d That voice was trembling, and it was obviously terrified, \u201c\u2026\u2026 they had all struck you that many times with the rod without any problems. Why is it that when I had only struck you once with the rod, you sagged forward and leant onto me\u2026\u2026 This, this\u2026\u2026 this is god, damned unfair! Unless, just because you see that I have grown to become handsome and dashing, that you grew jealous and decide to intentionally victimise me huh?\u201dChu Yang was at a loss for words.Who is that person? To even still be complaining\u2026 It is also all right for him to be complaining, after all, no one is also willing to meet with that sort of incident right? It is just that, even while complaining, he unexpectedly also did not forget to praise himself with a few sentences\u2026\u2026To be narcissistic until such a stage, that was already enough to shock the Heavens and Earth while causing ghosts and gods to cry!With a groan, Chu Yang finally forced his eyes open. He could no longer ignore it. Even if Chu Yang was the Poisonous Sword Revered Martial Artist of one generation, he also could not tolerate that voice.That voice, as if mixed from the howl of a wolf that had been hungry for a long time with a little hoarse, throaty sound belonging to a drake\u2026\u2026 there was no need to mention a person, but even a tiger would also collapse after listening to it for a long time\u2026\u2026\u201cYou woke up, you woke up, wahaha, I just knew it. You were actually shocked and stunned by my smart looks, and it wasn\u2019t that you had fainted and collapsed\u2026\u2026\u201d That voice continued to ravage Chu Yang\u2019s ears, \u201cIt was just like what I had said huh. Why was it that while we were having a good time sparring, you actually began to stare at my face without looking away\u2026\u2026 so it was like that!\u201dChu Yang frowned. His brain was still in a turbulent sea of pain. With a soft voice, he shouted, \u201cShut up!\u201d He absolutely could not tolerate it any more. If you are to say two more sentences, I might as well stab my heart two more times and be done with it. After all, I am already a person who have died once, yet I still have to suffer the torture of your horrifying voice. Does this still make any natural sense huh? Even in death, I am not allowed to be at peace\u2026\u2026Are there any morals left in the world\u2026\u2026Although his voice was low, it was instead filled with dignity, and that overwhelming disposition of the Poisonous Sword Revered Martial Artist dissipated outwards unseen. Deterred by the harshness contained within those two short words, that relentlessly chattering fellow was actually dumbfounded, and could not speak.Chu Yang violently forced his eyes open, but instead found the sunlight before his eyes to be glaring, and a chaotic burst of golden stars momentarily flooded his vision. He could only once again shut his eyes, and then slowly pried them open\u2026\u2026Presented before him, was a human face. Yes, and he was also that person who was interestingly forceful in praising himself to be handsome and dashing. Correct. With the exception of Chu Yang and him at that place, there wasn\u2019t a third person.However, when Chu Yang saw that face, his heart was immediately filled with a sense of intimacy, and at the same time, he did not know whether to cry or laugh. To actually use the phrase \u2018handsome and smart\u2019 on that person, he sincerely felt as if \u2018resources were unwittingly being destroyed\u2019!That face was absolutely not ugly!Both of his eyes were large, while his nose was straight and prominent. His mouth was small, and he also had a pair of dashing eyebrows. Moreover, his face was white and fair, and he was neither fat nor thin.However, the most bizarre features were that, although his eyes were large and filled with vigor, the distance between both eyes were instead quite a far apart. One eye seemed as if it was just beside his left ear, while the other eye\u2026\u2026 and his right ear were neighbours.His eyebrows were naturally dashing; they were straight while slanting outwards. It was just that, although they were like two swords, one of the swords pierced the Heavens while the other sword instead severed Hell itself \u2014 their directions were actually, completely opposite!His nose was also very straight and prominent. It was just\u2026\u2026 that nose was also a little too straight and prominent. The bridge of his nose was like a mountain range, and actually separated both eyes apart!It was just like the Milky Way, separating the Weaver Girl and the Cowherd apart, forcing them to look at each other from afar. Those kind of eyes, even if they were to become cross eyed and look at each other\u2026\u2026 ah, it would also be quite hard.His mouth was also very small, such that it was even very rosy. However, having a small, cherry lipped mouth on the face of a man\u2026\u2026 especially on the face of this kind of man\u2026\u2026It was just like a dish \u2014 A piece of snow-white tofu, with a completely red cherry placed above it\u2026\u2026That kind of appearance, to say that it had character\u2026\u2026 that already could not be used to describe it! That appearance simply had too much character, such that there should be no others any where else in the world!Ah\u2026\u2026 whoever could find such a similar person, Chu Yang felt that he would simply worship the finder. That difficulty was too great.\u201cTan Tan?\u201d Chu Yang\u2019s entire body felt numb and sore. He also felt as if there were several knives violently churning within his mental consciousness, and his head felt as if it was about to burst. However, he instead strongly controlled himself, and revealed a gentle smile. \u201cTan Tan, you are still this talkative and narcissistic! That is super abnormal!\u201dThat person was a good childhood friend Chu Yang\u2019s, the Younger Martial Brother Tan Tan. \u2018Tan\u2019 for one of the Chinese characters in \u2018Speech\u2019, and \u2018Tan\u2019 for one of the Chinese characters in \u2018Epiphyllum\u2019. That name really invoked a pleasant feeling within people.Tan Tan was Chu Yang\u2019s buddy, and both were orphans, or rather, abandoned. Their Teacher had found them and raised them up. When Chu Yang was nineteen years old, Tan Tan had left on a journey. Then, news of his death was suddenly sent back. All along until that moment, Chu Yang never did know why had Tan Tan died. Who was his enemy?! He had investigated for a very long time, but instead never did find even a single piece of news.Tan Tan\u2019s death back then had an extremely great influence on Chu Yang. It had made his originally withdrawn character to become even more withdrawn and silent\u2026\u2026When he had only heard that voice while his eyes were earlier closed, Chu Yang was already certain. After opening his eyes and sweeping a glance around, as if almost immediately, he already knew where he was at that moment.This place is really too familiar!Beyond The Heavens Storey, back mountains, Purple Bamboo Forest. That scenario \u2014 during the time when he was sixteen, Tan Tan and him had been sparring using rod techniques when he suddenly fell into a daze, and was then struck unconscious by Tan Tan when he failed to withdraw his attack in time.Unless, he had actually returned to the time when he was sixteen years old? Yet how\u2026\u2026 could that be possible??Chu Yang\u2019s gaze wandered around. After he had finished looking another complete circle, he was finally certain. He had indeed been reborn! Back to when he was sixteen years old. That kind of completely impossible incident, had instead actually happened on him at that very moment. Even with Chu Yang\u2019s tough mentality, he was also actually dazed from the sudden shock and happiness!If everything can begin once again, within my lifetime, how much can I not let go?!Today, I have really returned to the past?!Chu Yang was stunned for a very long time before he regained himself. He took in a deep breath, and suppressed the rising emotions that seemed to be gushing out from his heart. His face was instead flooded with a red flush, and he could only feel his heart drumming in a typically intense beat, as if it would jump out of his mouth at any time.Turning his head back, while carefully inspecting that once lost, but now recovered Brother. From within Chu Yang\u2019s eyes, deep and overwhelming emotions were shot out. In a slightly faint and hoarse voice, he instead teased and said, \u201cTan Tan, I finally understand the truth behind why you were abandoned in those years already\u2026\u2026\u201d Indeed, after having gave birth to such a fellow\u2026\u2026 if the family had not been frightened enough to instantly get rid of him, ah, their mentality would have been extremely tenacious.Tan Tan embarrassedly scratched his head. Unexpectedly, with a little bit of shame, he said, \u201cThe reason should be because I was too handsome\u2026\u2026 while the reason you were abandoned, I estimate that it is because you were too ugly\u2026\u2026\u201dChu Yang rolled his white eyes, and suddenly felt an urge to beat someone up, as well as an urge to laugh\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026From his memories, those injuries had caused him to lay in bed for half a month.It was only until later that he came to know, he absolutely did not make a mistake while he was sparring. Instead, he was poisoned by someone! Within a certain time frame, that poison would cause his entire body to become paralysed!Far from him being the only target, his poisoner\u2019s original intention was to, after calculating and targeting a specific time period, let Tan Tan directly kill him in a single strike. That way, Tan Tan would also be finished\u2026\u2026Within the Sect, the Disciples sparring between themselves were common occurrences. However, if someone was to get killed, then that would instead become a large incident! Tan Tan being excommunicated from the sect would also have been a definite consequence!However, the person responsible for poisoning had completely not thought that, during that period of time, although Tan Tan might have appeared to be well-matched with Chu Yang, his actual martial powers had instead exceeded Chu Yang\u2019s. When he had sparred against Chu Yang, he had always retained a certain percentage of his strength.During the most crucial moment, although he had not managed to withhold his attack in time, he had instead managed to shed off more than half the strength behind the rod\u2019s attack, resulting in Chu Yang only suffering minor injuries!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euUnder his Teacher\u2019s charge, including himself, and adding Tan Tan, there were a total of three Disciples! The poisoner, was the Eldest Martial Brother! Shi Qian Shan!A piercingly cold ray of light momentarily glinted in Chu Yang\u2019s eyes. He silently recited those three words within his mind \u2014 Shi, Qian, Shan!His facial expression suddenly changed and became similar to a Winter\u2019s chill, which gradually became colder. A faint killing intent began to envelop and drift about around him. Just beside him, without knowing why, Tan Tan actually felt a sudden chill pierce his bones. In the heat of that summer, he could not help but shudder and shiver from the cold.[Rylain\u2019s Translator Notes:1.

    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHypocriteThat was because during that period of time, their Teacher had received a \u201cSpring and Autumn Elixir\u201d distributed by the sect; The Spring and Autumn Elixir, as its name had suggested, could increase a year\u2019s worth of pure martial powers in the person who had consumed it!Their Teacher had completed a task for the sect, and therefore obtained the Spring and Autumn Elixir as a reward. Chu Yang remembered that his Teacher had once said, that he would also no longer receive any benefit from consuming that kind of medicine again. That was why, between Chu Yang and his two Martial Brothers, he was thinking of choosing someone to consume it.Spring and Autumn Elixir. Chu Yang\u2019s heart was filled with a momentary sorrow. If that was to be tossed away in the Three Higher Heavens, no one would even bother picking up that kind of rubbish. Instead, that had became the reason for Eldest Martial Brother to be treacherous towards both him and Tan Tan!Remembering his previous life, that Spring and Autumn Elixir was also given away to Eldest Martial Brother Shi Qian Shan\u2026\u2026It was only until when Tan Tan had suddenly met with an accident and died, and during the time when Chu Yang had once went to pay his respects to Tan Tan, that he unintentionally also saw that Eldest Martial Brother was also around. Moreover, before Tan Tan\u2019s gravestone marker, Eldest Martial Brother had revealed the truth of that matter, which was secretly heard by Chu Yang. Only then did he know, that the Eldest Martial Brother whom both he and Tan Tan had all along respected, was actually such a despicable person!When he had thought until that point, Chu Yang secretly sighed. In their previous lives, how foolish had both he and Tan Tan been\u2026\u2026Shi Qian Shan, with a slim build, he had a very refined appearance, and was twenty-three or twenty-four years of age. During normal days, he would be extremely nice towards Chu Yang and Tan Tan. From how it usually looked like, that Eldest Martial Brother seemed to be even closer than a natural elder brother.However, he had never thought that everything would actually be an act! Shi Qian Shan, from the beginning to the end, had all along made use of Chu Yang and Tan Tan! All of his usual pretense, was just to step on the both of them during a critical period, and monopolise the cultivation resources of the sect!As to why Shi Qian Shan had done such a thing, Chu Yang also understood the reason. Through using all means and methods necessary, he wanted to enter the Inner Quarters of the Beyond The Heavens Storey, and obtain the qualifications to become an Inner Quarters Disciple. After that, he would then aspire to become the Eldest Martial Brother of all the Inner Quarters Disciples in the entire Beyond The Heavens Storey, and obtain the rights to enter the Seven Shades Congregation Grounds of the Beyond The Heavens Storey!Once he had entered that place, he would then be a candidate for the sect\u2019s next Sect Master! Of all the generations of Disciples in the Beyond The Heavens Storey, only a single person would be able to enter!With regard to power and authority, Shi Qian Shan fanatically pursued them enthusiastically! In his eyes, to achieve his objectives, he would unconditionally sacrifice everything!For Chu Yang and his two Martial Brothers, they were all External Disciples of the Beyond The Heavens Storey. According to common reasoning, it was absolutely impossible for them to enter the Inner Quarters. For Shi Qian Shan to think of entering, he would need to stand out with his exceptional talents time and time again at the sect\u2019s Disciples Sparring Conventions, until he was the last person standing!That was also the Beyond The Heavens Storey\u2019s method to excite and encourage its Disciples to improve since ages past.That was why, even though that Spring and Autumn Elixir would only raise a mere one year\u2019s worth of pure martial powers, from each of those young Disciple\u2019s point of view, a single year\u2019s worth of pure martial powers was instead sufficient to outstrip Martial Brothers of similar classes by a long distance!In his previous life, Shi Qian Shan had succeeded. He had, from that moment\u2019s status as an External Disciple, slowly climbed up one step at a time, and finally entered the Inner Quarters, obtaining the qualification to contend for the position of Eldest Martial Brother.However, four years later, for reasons unknown, the Beyond The Heavens Storey was suddenly besieged by a coalition of various large sects, annihilated while turning into smoke and flying ashes in the span of a single night!Meanwhile, Chu Yang had fallen unconscious due to serious injuries, and was then buried under many layers of corpses. When he regained consciousness, it had already been three days later.During that moment, fierce fires raged throughout the Beyond The Heavens Storey, and they had not yet been completely burnt out. After being severely burnt relentlessly for three days, the main building of the Beyond The Heavens Storey finally collapsed completely, nearly smashing the immobilised Chu Yang under it.However, after the collapse, a fragment of a sword was instead revealed in a deep part of the building\u2019s foundation, sparkling brilliantly! It seemed to carry with it a Devil\u2019s temptation\u2026\u2026That was the first fragment of the Nine Tribulation Sword, the Sword Point.Chu Yang had generally met with great fortune and obtained a fragment of the Nine Tribulation Sword. The road to Chu Yang\u2019s rise would then begin from that moment forth\u2026\u2026 while at that point of time, he was already twenty years of age!Meanwhile, from within Chu Yang\u2019s memories, that collapsed building\u2019s foundation was the location of the Seven Shades Congregation Grounds of the Beyond The Heavens Storey!The place where Shi Qian Shan had also dreamed of entering!The corners of Chu Yang\u2019s lips revealed the hint of a smile, and he muttered, \u201cShi Qian Shan, in this lifetime, this Seven Shades Congregation Grounds will be mine!\u201dSince he had been reborn, since time had been brought back by four years, then how could he waste those four years? He definitely needed to obtain the Nine Tribulations Sword even earlier! Meanwhile, in order to obtain the Nine Tribulations Sword, he would need to enter the Inner Quarters, and obtain the status of Eldest Martial Brother before being able to enter the Seven Shades Congregation Grounds!Apart from that, there were also no other methods!\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Chu Yang\u2019s voice was extremely low, and Tan Tan absolutely could not hear. He only saw Chu Yang\u2019s lips moving momentarily, and he could not help asking.\u201cI said\u2026\u2026 this sky is really blue! This earth is really thick! These purple bamboos are really nice to look at! These flowers are really fragrant! Tan Tan, you have grown to become really handsome\u2026\u2026 Hahahaha\u2026\u2026\u201d Chu Yang jumped onto his feet, and suddenly burst out laughing. The sound of his laughter was clear and melodious, and it resonated for quite a distance.At that very moment, Chu Yang was completely inspired! All of the regret in his past life, would thus be compensated in that lifetime!Qing Wu, wait for me!I will not disappoint you in this life!I want to let you know, that you look nicer than a sword! I want to let you know, that in this world, you look the nicest! You look the nicest!Tan Tan, my good Brother! I will not let you die again!Mo Tian Ji, you had better watch out!The peak in the Way of the Heavens, I, Chu Yang\u2026\u2026 will, ascend! To! It!\u201cHey, it is a matter-of-course that I am handsome, but is this sky, this earth, these purple bamboos\u2026\u2026 just how are they nice to look at huh\u2026\u2026 you are really crazy,\u201d Tan Tan muttered, batting his eyelids. One of his eyebrows seemed as if it was raised towards the skies, while the other seemed as though it was stabbing into the ground.\u201cChu Yang, Tan Tan! Are the both of you here huh?\u201d Following the sound of a momentary refreshing laughter, a young man in cyan clothes emerged from amongst the Purple Bamboo Forest whilst dodging the branches.The person had a slim build, and a thin face. He was tanned, and had a pair of eyes that were not large, but were instead very lively.Shi Qian Shan!Chu Yang immediately turned his head around to take a look, and calmly looked at that gentle and smiling face. He clearly saw a hint of disappointment and annoyance flashed by deeply within Shi Qian Shan\u2019s gaze.That was a feeling of annoyance generated from seeing that Chu Yang was actually safe and sound! Damn it, why did he not die?However, Shi Qian Shan promptly revealed a face filled with an angry expression, and shouted, \u201cWhat are the both of you doing? Chu Yang, what happened to your head? Didn\u2019t I tell the both of you earlier, that during sparring practises between Martial Brothers, attacks should stop with light touches; attacks should stop with light touches! Tan Tan, by using that much strength, are you thinking of hitting Chu Yang to death?\u201dTan Tan looked at Shi Qian Shan with a little fear, his entire face filled with shame. He gaped, and muttered, \u201cEldest Martial Brother, it\u2019s\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s my mistake\u2026\u2026 my, my handsome and dashing looks had shocked Chu Yang, and he\u2026\u2026 he fell into a daze\u2026\u2026\u201dChu Yang was momentarily speechless.\u201cAh, the both of you, ah, the both of you\u2026\u2026 really do not give me a peace of mind,\u201d Shi Qian Shan gave out a sigh that was filled with failed expectations, \u201cAh, when will the both of you let Teacher and me be assured? You are both already of this age, but still behave like children\u2026\u2026\u201dWhile saying that, he quickly walked over with a face full of concern. As he was walking, with a *Shaa* \u2014 sound, he had already torn off a piece of his inner clothes. When he had arrived before Chu Yang, he had a face of pity. \u201cDoes it hurt huh? Don\u2019t move, I will bandage it for you. Do not move recklessly. For these few days, do not run about, otherwise you will let the wind enter your wounds\u2026\u2026\u201dShi Qian Shan carefully used the front of his clothes to wipe away the traces of blood on Chu Yang, and then began to bandage Chu Yang\u2019s wounds using a light and gentle strength. Finally, feeling assured, he looked over once more. Letting out a breath, he said, \u201cAi, if Teacher saw this, he would definitely want to blame me once more for not looking over my two Younger Martial Brothers. Ah, the both of you\u2026\u2026\u201d He sighed while shaking his head.\u201cEldest Martial Brother\u2026\u2026 we were in the wrong\u2026\u2026\u201d Feeling miserable, Tan Tan said, \u201cSorry. When I fight with him again, I will just mask my face\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy did you apologise to me? Ai, such a large wound, would it hurt if I were to place it on your body?\u201d Shi Qian Shan angrily said, \u201cYou should apologise to Younger Martial Brother Chu Yang!\u201dTowards Tan Tan\u2019s narcissism, Shi Qian Shan faintly revealed a hint of disdain in his eyes. Such an ugly thing, he can actually be narcissistic to such a stage? That really is unthinkable.Whenever Shi Qian Shan spoke, every single sentence would make others feel as if those words had been spoken from the bottom of his heart. Moreover, his gaze never flinched, and had always watched directly at the other person in the eyes. His gaze appeared magnanimous, and people would know from a single look that he was upright, that everything he had done, had all been done sincerely!\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Tan Tan nodded his head repeatedly, his entire face filled with guilt and shame. Under Eldest Martial Brother\u2019s care-filled scolding, he intuitively felt ashamed. Whilst helplessly touching his face, Tan Tan sadly gave a sigh, and felt that he was that much handsome and dashing, suave to the extent of shocking the Heavens and moving the Earth, that it actually brought disaster and was therefore an unforgivable thing\u2026\u2026Chu Yang secretly gave a momentarily sigh. That Shi Qian Shan, no matter if it were his expressions and actions, or even tone, they all seemed that much genuine, and there were absolutely no flaws. If he had not been reborn, he would definitely have been deceived by him\u2026\u2026It was no wonder that in his previous life, that person would be able to continuously stand out from amongst all the External Disciples and swiftly rose through the ranks, until he was finally able to compete for the position of Eldest Martial Brother!If the Beyond The Heavens Storey had not been annihilated, Chu Yang was definitely certain that in the end, the position of Inner Quarters Disciples\u2019 Eldest Martial Brother would absolutely be Shi Qian Shan\u2019s foregone conclusion!That kind of capability to present a set of actions but actually perform another set of actions, that was really too rare! It was simply flawless! Others would never know what he was secretly thinking in his mind.It was no wonder that in my previous life, after Shi Qian Shan had entered the Inner Quarters, within an extremely short period of time, he would be able to obtain the affection of Sect Master Wu Yun Liang\u2019s daughter, Wu Qing Qing\u2026\u2026Wu Qing Qing had been called to be the most beautiful woman in the Beyond The Heavens Storey, so how would she lack in the number of suitors? However, Shi Qian Shan\u2019s physical appearance was nothing extraordinary, but he had instead quietly captured the affections of that girl who had been so loved by the Heavens! During that moment, when the news had spread, the entire Beyond the Heavens Storey was in a state of shock!However, at the moment, Chu Yang instead knew that everything had not been incidental! Shi Qian Shan, he would be able to do it!In this lifetime, however, for Shi Qian Shan to once again think of easily doing it\u2026\u2026 that will be difficult. That is because, before him, there is still me, Chu Yang! Before me, all of his conspiracies are no different from being non-existent!\u201cLet\u2019s go, follow me and return to recuperate your injuries,\u201d Shi Qian Shan attentively supported Chu Yang as he stood up.Chu Yang momentarily smiled, but just as he was about to take a step, he was suddenly startled. From within his own Dantian, there emerged the feeling of an extreme hunger. Or it could also be said, that it was a very pressing, very urgent feeling.Chu Yang was immediately startled!What is happening? Being hungry\u2026\u2026 should also be the stomach\u2019s affair right? Or maybe the stomach would feel unbearable, but why is the Dantian also hungry?That kind of feeling surged forth like a rushing tide. Within his Dantian, it was also as if a pot had been opened.Given the strength of Chu Yang\u2019s mental convictions, he actually also found it to be absolutely unbearable! Feeling really unbearable, Chu Yang immersed into his mental consciousness, activated his martial powers and observed his body\u2019s internal situation. From a single look, Chu Yang nearly exclaimed out loud!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt the center of his Dantian, the shadow of an empty small sword had actually appeared! Its colour was dark and murky, and it was only the size of the part of a finger where fingerprints began. On the body of the sword, eight cracks could be clearly seen!The shape of that sword was a little weird, but from Chu Yang\u2019s point of view, it was instead incomparably familiar!Although dilapidated, that was only just an illusory shadow, and even though it was without a form, it emanated the hint of an absolutely domineering presence!Isn\u2019t, isn\u2019t this the Nine Tribulations Sword huh?! Why is it within my own Dantian?Within a moment, Chu Yang was stupefied. His body staggered twice, and he almost fell from the shock!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySecret Behind The Nine Tribulations SwordThat calling due to an extreme longing once again appeared, and Chu Yang carefully waited in anticipation for a while. Indeed, within a short period of time, the faint and dim Nine Tribulations Sword within his Dantian once again sent off a strong and intense calling of desire\u2026\u2026That kind of feeling was like a baby who could no longer tolerate being hungry, and was wildly flailing his or her legs while crying and screaming, wanting to drink milk. The appearance of that feeling caused Chu Yang to momentarily sweat. He really did not know how that sort of ridiculous feeling was produced.When his thoughts came into contact with that feeling, the faint and dim Nine Tribulations Sword gave off light feelings of resistance and curiosity, as if a baby was looking at himself or herself with wide and innocent eyes. That baby\u2019s gaze was filled with desire, unfamiliarity, and expectations\u2026\u2026Without any reason, Chu Yang momentarily felt a wave of gentle affection well up from within him, and tenderly willed his thoughts over to embrace it\u2026\u2026 At that time, the silhouette of that sword only slightly resisted for a while, and then it let down all of its guard.Upon contact with his thoughts, Chu Yang also understood how that thing came about!That was not exactly the Nine Tribulations Sword; Correctly speaking, that was the Soul belonging to the Nine Tribulations Sword! Or it could also be called the Sword\u2019s Awareness!It was during the time when he had performed that destructive technique, and had pierced the Nine Tribulations Sword into his own heart, that the blood from his heart poured out and stimulated the Sword\u2019s Soul. That also meant that the beginning phase of the Nine Tribulations Sword\u2019s greatest secret had been stimulated\u2026\u2026Meanwhile, it was that stimulated Sword\u2019s Soul which, without knowing how, actually brought him back to the period when he was a youth!The final technique of the Nine Tribulations Sword was originally a tabooed technique. To perish together with the enemy, moreover, to first kill himself, then kill the enemy! Only someone who possessed that kind of decisive thought would be able to perform it!What Chu Yang did not know was, that was exactly one of the mysterious parts of the Nine Tribulations Sword!All the previous Masters of the Nine Tribulations Sword had only practised according to the Path of Sword Cultivation; meanwhile, they did not obtain the Nine Tribulations Sword\u2019s approval! That was because, by completely treating it as a sword to be used for practise\u2026\u2026 Then, what could be obtained from that?A sword, was originally emotionless. That was why, while they were being driven by such practises, they had naturally chosen the Path of the Emotionless Sword!That was why, all of the previous Masters of the Nine Tribulations Sword, they were only \u201cSlaves to the Sword\u201d! Including Chu Yang in his previous life, he was also merely a Slave to the Sword! Slave to the Sword!It was the sword that was making use of the people, and not the people who were making use of the sword!However, Chu Yang had instead performed the final technique, \u2018With the blood of my heart, ten thousand tribulations will collapse!\u2019Excluding Chu Yang, none of all the previous people who obtained the Nine Tribulations Sword had dared to use that technique! Meanwhile, after their lives had reached the limit, or after they had been accidentally killed by others, the Nine Tribulations Sword would automatically break apart, and once again return into its fragmented state, scattering across the continents. It would silently await its true Master, looking forward to the very day that it would stand at the very peak of the Nine Tribulations Sword\u2019s brilliance, while it revealed its true divine destiny\u2026\u2026That was why, whilst without a care for anything else, Chu Yang\u2019s performance of the final technique had resulted in the Sword\u2019s Soul to completely activate, and resided within his Dantian. Meanwhile, it was also from that moment forth, that the godly item which was ranked first in the Continent of the Nine Heavens, truly had a Master!That was also why it would accept Chu Yang that easily.It could be said, that with the exception of the Nine Tribulations Sword\u2019s creator, Chu Yang was the first Master of the Nine Tribulations Sword!The veritable Master of the Nine Tribulations Sword.That was what it truly meant, to survive after facing the danger of death!From that very moment forth, Chu Yang clearly knew that he would walk on a completely different path as compared to his previous life!At that moment, the Sword\u2019s Soul belonging to that Nine Tribulations Sword was just like a baby who was frantically waiting to be laid to sleep, and was pressing for the various fragments of the Nine Tribulations Sword, and nourishment from the spiritual energies of the Heavens and Earth! By giving out those kinds of pressing emotions, it was also urging Chu Yang to seek the fragments of the Nine Tribulations Sword! As to finding the necessary nourishment for the Nine Tribulations Sword\u2026\u2026Chu Yang\u2019s concentration sank into his Dantian. Then, using his mind\u2019s concentration, he embraced that faint and dim Sword\u2019s Soul, and whole-heartedly focused his intent at pacifying it\u2026\u2026After some time, as if the intent of the Nine Tribulations Sword had sensed Chu Yang\u2019s sincerity, it slowly began to quieten down. Although there remained some unwillingness, it instead no longer gave out those calls of longing\u2026\u2026It was like a child who did not manage to obtain his or her favourite toy, but was instead understanding enough not to forcibly throw a tantrum. It only pouted and held back its tears, and with an expression of grievance, looked at his or her own parents\u2026\u2026That Soul of the Nine Tribulations Sword was rather like an adorable small child.A momentary sense of pity welled up from within Chu Yang, and under that kind of sentiment, he actually felt a sense of shame accumulating from within his heart\u2026\u2026He controlled his feelings of excitement, and exhaled a long breath. Opening his eyes, he instead saw Shi Qian Shan looking at him, before himself. Within the deepest recesses of Shi Qian Shan\u2019s eyes, there was actually a slight hint of excitement. It was probably because he had thought that Chu Yang showing that kind of abnormality was due to his injuries. When he saw Chu Yang opening his eyes, that excitement within his eyes fleeted away, and with a concerned tone of voice, he said, \u201cYounger Martial Brother Chu, what happened to you?\u201d\u201cNothing. It was only just\u2026\u2026 earlier, I suddenly felt like farting, but\u2026\u2026 however, taking into account that Senior Martial Brother, you were following directly behind, I was embarrassed, and had spent quite a large amount of effort to restrain it back\u2026\u2026\u201d Chu Yang said seriously, and gave Shi Qian Shan a meaningful look.\u201cUrgh\u2026\u2026\u201d Shi Qian Shan\u2019s facial expression changed, and he embarrassedly said, \u201cThis\u2026\u2026 it must be very uncomfortable right\u2026\u2026\u201d Within that short span of time, he also did not know how to answer; on whether he should advise Chu Yang to fart or\u2026\u2026 Chu Yang should still hold it in like that\u2026\u2026Ah, either way, both were unsuitable in terms of keeping up appearances\u2026\u2026At one side, with a *Pu*, Tan Tan also began to laugh. However, he also felt that it was not the appropriate time, and therefore did not dare to give out a loud laughter. Adding to the fact that he had a unique voice, that had resulted in the laughing sound to actually, really, sound as if a typical fart had been released\u2026\u2026Shi Qian Shan momentarily felt a wave of nausea, and almost threw up.Within his mind, Chu Yang gave an imaginary, secret smile. He felt that it was as if his own mentality had slowly began to change, as if, when compared to his previous life, he was no longer the same\u2026\u2026All of his regrets, had been given the chance to be atoned. Naturally, his mentality also became one that was inspired and not easily provoked.In his previous life, he had only obtained the Sword Point of the Nine Tribulations Sword four years later from that very moment. Moreover, throughout his past life, he did not know that the Nine Tribulations Sword actually had that kind of Sword\u2019s Soul!Taking a step at a time, as he walked towards the houses within the Purple Bamboo Forest, Chu Yang\u2019s way of thinking seemed as though it was also changing, and that its transformation was being completed as he neared his destination.With each step that Chu Yang took, as he neared the house that had only existed within his memories, he could feel his own soul trembling once. Then, a new feeling and mood would begin to rise from within his heart. Slowly, his heart actually began to fill with longing.Within that house, was his own Teacher! The person whom he had respected the most throughout his entire life!Since he had returned to when he was sixteen years of age, then, without caring if he had been reborn or whatever, at that moment, he was already no longer that Poisonous Sword Revered Martial Artist! At that moment, he was Chu Yang, a youth! A frail and delicate youth!On that continent, before had he matured, there were countless people who could cause his death! If he had still thought of himself as the Revered Martial Expert of his previous life, then under the circumstance of his capabilities being a mismatch with his mentality, he would then die exceedingly fast\u2026\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOnly Chu Yang knew, that a Revered Martial Artist would still be able to have a lifetime of prestige in that Three Lower Heavens. However, should a Revered Martial Artist arrive at the Three Middle Heavens, there would still be instances where that person\u2019s hands and feet would be tied up, and he or she would therefore require to be careful with his or her endeavours. Meanwhile, should a Revered Martial Artist arrive at the Three Higher Heavens\u2026\u2026He or she would then be nothing special!Only by forgetting the past glories of his previous life, and beginning anew, one step at a time, continuing until his arrival to the peak \u2014 that would be the only correct rationality! Then, for the first step, that would be to become the Eldest Martial Brother of all the Inner Quarters Disciples of Beyond The Heavens Sect within the shortest time possible, then entering the Seven Shades Congregation Grounds and obtain the first fragment of the Nine Tribulations Sword!For the path of that life, what could be imagined was that it would definitely be a lot more exciting that his previous life!The three people stopped their footsteps at the same time; they had already arrived at the Purple Bamboo Garden. While looking at those few houses that had previously only remained within his memories, deep and intense emotions were shot forth from within Chu Yang\u2019s eyes. He unintentionally stopped his feet and stood still, and he could only feel the emotions within his heart surging forth like a tide. He was actually unable to momentarily contain his emotions!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There were the ten great Disciples of the seventh generation belonging to the Beyond The Heavens Storey, and each were in charge of a separate location; Forthcoming Clouds Peak, Misty Clouds Peak, Distant Clouds Peak, Separating Clouds Peak, Gathering Clouds Peak, Locking Clouds Peak, Dream Clouds Peak, Hatred Clouds Peak, Stepping On The Clouds Peak, and Purple Bamboo Garden.The Gathering Clouds Peak was the Peak where the Sect Master Wu Yun Liang resided, and it was the main Peak amongst The Nine Peaks. The Single Garden was the Purple Bamboo Garden where Chu Yang resided. Amongst The Nine Peaks and The Single Garden, although the scenery of the Purple Bamboo Garden was the most beautiful, it was instead ranked at the end when it came to resources amongst the nine.The Master of the Purple Bamboo Garden, Meng Chao Ran, was the Youngest Martial Brother amongst the ten great Disciples, and he had a natural disposition to be indifferent; aloof from worldly affairs. He never competed with his nine Martial Brothers for anything, and throughout his whole life, he had only taken in Shi Qian Shan, Chu Yang and Tan Tan as his three Disciples.With the exception of Shi Qian Shan being accepted due to feelings and favours that were owed unto others, Chu Yang and Tan Tan were both orphans who had been picked up by Meng Chao Ran.In every single generation of Disciples, there would be a selection for the ten great Disciples amongst the Inner Quarters Disciples; to become the various people in charge of The Nine Peaks and The Single Garden. Meanwhile, the Eldest Martial Brother of the ten great Disciples would be the future candidate for the Beyond the Heavens Storey\u2019s Sect Master, dominating the Gathering Clouds Peak.No matter if it were the degree of Spiritual Medicinal resources or Spiritual Energy secret manuals, the Gathering Clouds Peak was ranked first amongst The Nine Peaks.For those positions of the ten great Disciples, the Disciples of The Nine Peaks and The Single Garden had been competing amongst themselves for several hundreds of years; every single person had desperately trained themselves for those ten positions. Under those kind of encouraging and pressurising conditions, the cultivation of the Disciples belonging to the Beyond The Heavens Storey had improved by leaps and bounds.The name of that world was the Continent of the Nine Heavens. The Beyond The Heavens Storey was located at the Three Lower Heavens, or the \u2018Continent of the Lower Heavens\u2019. In the eyes of common men, there were a few mysterious locations on the Continent of the Lower Heavens that was permeated with misty clouds throughout the year. No matter if it were men or beasts, or even birds that flew, none of them could get close to those locations.Only several martial experts who were powerful in their cultivation would know that the entrances to enter the Three Middle Heavens and transcend the Three Lower Heavens laid there.There existed similar mysterious places within the Three Middle Heavens, and those were the entrances to the Three Higher Heavens!For a person to even think of entering, he or she would require to possess martial powers that had transcended the world!The Continent of the Nine Heavens. As its name had suggested, was an extremely large continent. From the East to the West, since the beginning, no one knew how far the distance stretched. From the South to the North, there were never any records of how distant one end was to the other. It was boundless!There were countless legends and countless myths on that vast continent, and they were passed down from generation to generation. Since ancient times, there were an unknown number of emperors, kings, generals and ministers, as well as heroes emerging like an endless stream.On a certain day, one might be drinking red wine with friends while appreciating songs and dance, yet that person might be locked in chains and become a death row convict on the very next day. On a certain day, one might be an emperor, yet on the very next day, it did not mean that person would not become the general of a defeated army, or a ghost after dying under the edge of a blade. On a certain day, one might be a plundering thief, yet who could say that the person would not be putting on the yellow gown, becoming an emperor on the very next day?On that mysterious continent, it was possible for anything to happen!Similar to any continental planets, there were also boundaries beyond the imperial court. Beyond those boundaries, there were also wandering swordsmen. Besides those wandering swordsmen, there were also people associated with the martial society. With the existence of a martial society, there would be opposing sides, and those opposing sides would be separated into those which were righteous and those which were evil.Those who were righteous and those who were evil would never stand together, and conflicts between them were endless. Amidst the long and sustained conflicts, there were also various people who had formed their own system of martial etiquette codes, or places where conflicts had caused chaos during a certain period of time, or even places where several hundreds of years had passed by peacefully.Worldly matters, they were originally that intriguingly marvellous.No matter if it were the Ways of the Righteous, the Devil or Evil, in the eyes of common men, there was instead a common form of addressing those practitioners: Martial Artists in the Way of the Martial Arts!No matter the world, for swordsmen to violate restrictions through use of Martial Arts, the reasoning was always the same. The term \u2018Martial Arts\u2019 implied many meanings. Amongst all of those meanings, the most memorable interpretation would be no more than the word \u2018violence\u2019!Martial Arts implied that from a single disagreement, the ground within seven steps would be soaked with blood. Martial Arts implied performing meritorious services and achieving great success through wielding a weapon while riding atop a horse. Martial Arts implied being unscrupulous in the martial society, committing murder and plunder\u2026\u2026Martial Arts. Not only were they colourful, they were also associated with many disputes and conflicts.With the exception of the human race, there were also several mysterious races on that world. For example, amongst people of the Heavens and Earth, there was the Three Stars Holy Clan. It was said that in the past, there was a period of time when they were also once glorious, that they also possessed exotic powers that were bestowed by the Heavens, and had once reigned supreme, independently yet equally, alongside the human race. However, their numbers had already declined since a long, long time ago.There might still be other special Clans, but, those were even more fleeting than legends\u2026\u2026At the very least, Chu Yang could only count a handful of those that he had seen in his past life. Moreover, all of them belonged to Low Class Holy Clans. As for High Class Clans, he never saw even a single one. He did not know if they had become extinct, or if they were secretly hidden at a particular location\u2026\u2026Meanwhile, for human Martial Artists, no matter the Righteous or Evil, with regard to Fingers, Palms, Legs, Feet, Punches, Sabres, Swords\u2026\u2026 and all the other kinds of proficiencies, they all began with Pupil, Warrior, Artist, Master, Great Master, Revered, King, Emperor (Majesty), Gentleman, Saint\u2026\u2026 until, finally at the peak, they would be Supreme!There were eleven ranks, and each rank was separated into Nine Grades; from the First Grade to the Ninth Grade.Martial Skills implementing the Fists and Palms were generally referred to as Martial Arts. Martial Arts Pupil, Martial Arts Warrior, Martial Artist, Martial Arts Master, Martial Arts Great Master, Revered Martial Artist, Martial Artist King, Martial Artist Majesty, Martial Artist Gentleman, Martial Artist Saint.If the proficiency was to be changed to the Way of the Sabre, then it would be Sabre Pupil, Sabre Warrior, Sabre Artist\u2026\u2026 Sabre Saint!It was only the Way of the Sword, that although the beginning were the same, the Majesty rank was instead referred to as \u201cEmperor\u201d; that was the rule laid down by the first master of the Nine Tribulations Sword, and no one knew the reason behind that.After arriving at the Saint rank, one could basically be considered to already be at the pinnacle under the Heavens! That was because, since ancient times, people who were capable of becoming Supreme were only a scant few! It could be said that people who had achieved the rank of Supreme were just myths! According to legends, with regard to the capabilities for one who was at the rank of Supreme, he or she could call the winds and summon the rain, as well as travelling to the boundaries of the sky; he or she could also shift mountains and reclaim seas, as well as being able to attain transcendence!However, legends would always be only legends. No one had ever witnessed it for themselves! With regard to people of the Saint rank, their whereabouts had always been mysterious. People would rarely meet them.Since an unknown number of years, only people who were ranked Majesty and Emperor had reigned unrivaled under the Heavens! Each of them dominated their own regions!The Beyond The Heavens Storey which Chu Yang belonged to at that moment was situated at the Three Lower Heavens. Within the Continent of the Nine Heavens, that was the only single piece of space which the mundane imperial family held power and ruled. At the Three Lower Heavens, the imperial family had the absolute authority.\u201cCome in, the three of you.\u201d His entire body covered in a purple gown, Meng Chao Ran stood at the entrance to the Purple Bamboo Garden, bearing a tranquil expression that seemed otherworldly. When he saw the wound on Chu Yang\u2019s head, he only slightly raised his eyebrows, then regained his usual indifferent appearance.\u201cTeacher, both Younger Martial Brothers had made mistakes while sparring, and Younger Martial Brother Chu Yang had lost quite an amount of blood this time. I hope that Teacher will bestow some Spiritual Medicine to relieve some of Younger Martial Brother Chu Yang\u2019s pain.\u201d Shi Qian Shan said in a relatively urgent tone. From within his eyes, as well as his facial expression, they were both completely filled with intentions of concern.Shi Qian Shan\u2019s words were filled with concern towards his Younger Martial Brother, and seemed as though he did not have any other meaning. Neither did he intentionally use his tone to stress on several sensitive phrases. However, indirectly, those sentences were as good as mercilessly victimising Tan Tan before Meng Chao Ran!\u201cThere is no need.\u201d It was not known whether Meng Chao Ran could not tell from Shi Qian Shan\u2019s words, or if he was unconcerned. In an indifferent tone, Meng Chao Ran said, \u201cIt is a good thing for young people to suffer a little injury and endure a little pain. As long as the muscles and bones were not harmed, nor the life in any danger, is there a need to be this nervous?\u201dAs Chu Yang looked at the truly refined face before him, warm and intimate feelings began to well up from the bottom of his heart. It was as if he had the sudden impulse to rush forward and embrace his Teacher!His Teacher\u2026\u2026 was both his master and father, and that was both true and untrue. As an orphan, Chu Yang had been brought up by Meng Chao Ran ever since he was a child. In his mind, his Teacher was his most important and respected person. No matter what kind of achievements he would later obtain, or even during the time when he had obtained the rank of a Revered Martial Expert, his Teacher would always remain as a warm person in his mind.With regard to that Teacher of his, he appeared to be harmless towards other people and small animals, as well as being indifferent to matters of the world. However, none of the tens of thousands of worldly affairs escaped his eyes. No one could possibly imagine the secrets and caution that Meng Chao Ran had kept within both his heart and mind.All along, Meng Chao Ran had never sought fame nor openly revealed his capabilities, which was why no one could possibly imagine the strength that he possessed.Chu Yang could still remember the moment of the catastrophe that would befall upon the Beyond The Heavens Storey four years later. Meng Chao Ran\u2019s white clothes fluttered as he danced, a single man with a single sword, switching between postures amidst the fiercely raging flames! Countless enemies gave out numerous, miserable cries of death as they fell under his sword. Clearly, he could easily break through the encirclement and leave, but he had instead remained guarding that place, until the sect had been reduced to a piece of scorched earth.It was only at that moment, Chu Yang then knew that his Teacher Meng Chao Ran was a man who had kept a profile so low, that it could not get any lower within the Beyond The Heavens Storey, and that he was actually one of the very few people who had the strongest cultivation within the Beyond The Heavens Storey! His entire cultivation had already achieved the domain level of a Martial Arts Great Master! It was even to the point of being close to the rank of Revered Martial Artist!At the final moment, Meng Chao Ran discovered the seriously wounded Chu Yang. Drifting over, and with a single palm strike, he caused Chu Yang to become dizzy. Then, Chu Yang could only feel himself being pressed down by countless corpses.That was undoubtedly his Teacher\u2019s only method of preserving his life. However, Chu Yang never did get to meet Meng Chao Ran in his life after that, and he also did not get to hear any news with regard to Meng Chao Ran\u2026\u2026In Chu Yang\u2019s previous life, finding his Teacher\u2019s traces was his life\u2019s mission that he had always remembered in his mind! Finding his Teacher, protecting his Teacher, and repaying his Teacher\u2026\u2026 those were also his wishes. However, Chu Yang never did manage to find him\u2026\u2026 that also became a regret which he had always kept in his heart.At that very moment, to once again see that familiar and intimate face, Chu Yang was unintentionally filled with mixed emotions.\u201cThe Contest of the Peaks will be held in another three months.\u201d Meng Chao Ran\u2019s voice interrupted Chu Yang\u2019s thoughts, and he could only hear him say, \u201cThe three of you had better intensify your practise and see who is capable of entering the Inner Quarters to become Inner Quarters Disciples. This is an event of our Beyond The Heavens Storey, so all of you should not slacken.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The three people answered simultaneously.\u201cOur Beyond The Heavens Storey is different from the other sects. Masters of The Nine Peaks and The Single Garden have all along been produced from amongst Inner Quarters Disciples. I also wish that at least one of you is capable of becoming one of the ten great Disciples, and inherit the Purple Bamboo Garden.\u201dMeng Chao Ran easily gave a smile and said, \u201cHowever, if you are incapable, then there is no need to force yourself. I will personally bring all of you away from the Purple Bamboo Garden, and seek a place for you to live in seclusion.\u201dChu Yang secretly gave a bitter smile. That Teacher of his was still that easygoing. Regardless the matter, he never placed them on his mind; for that kind of a great event, if it were another person, he or she would try exceedingly hard. However, in Meng Chao Ran\u2019s mind, he actually did not weigh that event heavily.\u201cThis Disciple will definitely not disappoint Teacher\u2019s expectations!\u201d Shi Qian Shan\u2019s gaze became fervent as he gave his pledge.\u201cMmm, there is something that I must do, so I will be leaving for a while.\u201d Meng Chao Ran said calmly, \u201cIt is possible that I might even be back after the contest. All of you shall voluntarily intensify your practise, and that will do.\u201dThe three of them were startled at the same time. Due to the imminent contest, which of the other Peaks\u2019 Teachers was not putting in all of their efforts in pressing their Disciples to practise? However, that Teacher of theirs was unexpectedly leaving at that critical juncture? Even to the point of completely washing his hands off without any concern?\u201cTeacher, please be careful of everything. Teacher, since you have decided to leave at this critical juncture, then that must definitely be an important matter that cannot be delayed.\u201d Chu Yang thought for a moment, then said, \u201cThe Heavens and Earth do not shift, neither does the stone turn amidst the flowing river, and there are still many days ahead. It is just as what you had just taught us. With regard to anything, there is no need to force yourself. We only look forward to Teacher returning safely, and do not have any other request.\u201dChu Yang could still faintly remember, that after Meng Chao Ran had left, he only came back half a year later. Moreover, he had returned bearing serious injuries, and he had to rest for over a year to fully recover.Given his capabilities of a Martial Arts Great Master, he was already an expert on the Three Lower Heavens, and there were only very few people who could injure him. There were only two possibilities. It was either Meng Chao Ran had been surrounded and attacked by quite a large number of enemies, or that he had gone\u2026\u2026 to the Three Middle Heavens!The Heavens and Earth do not shift, neither does the stone turn amidst the flowing river!Meng Chao Ran\u2019s body suddenly trembled momentarily. It was as if a thunderclap had suddenly rang out from the Ninth Heaven and struck him on his head, thus causing him to actually become startled for a moment. After quite some time, Meng Chao Ran then turned around and looked at Chu Yang, shooting forth a mysterious gaze at him.Amongst the three Disciples, Shi Qian Shan was passionate for power, coveting the position of the Inner Quarters Disciples\u2019 Eldest Martial Brother, while Tan Tan had the mentality of a youth, and was ignorant. Only Chu Yang was aware that him leaving on that trip was not only a matter of great importance, but that there would also be danger. Moreover, amongst the words which he had said, there were some that actually contained a deep meaning.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, the most crucial words were still those \u201cThe Heavens and Earth do not shift, neither does the stone turn amidst the flowing river\u201d, which faintly seemed as if it had actually struck at the bottleneck of the many years of his cultivation\u2026\u2026Chu Yang gave a secret smile. Teacher, don\u2019t blame me for stopping you, ah, I am doing this for your own good. When you had left for this trip in my previous life, you had barely managed to escape back while bearing fatal injuries. That proves your capabilities are still not enough to perform that task. It is still better for you to concentrate on cultivating your skills for a period of time right\u2026\u2026That \u201cThe Heavens and Earth do not shift, neither does the stone turn amidst the flowing river\u201d, was the verse to break through the bottleneck for the domain level of Martial Arts Great Master. Once a person\u2019s capabilities had reached the peak of Martial Arts Great Master, he or she would then encounter a bottleneck. Only after the person had perceived and obtained insight, would he or she be able to break through it.Meanwhile, that \u201cThe Heavens and Earth do not shift, neither does the stone turn amidst the flowing river\u201d, was a kind of domain level! Only after a Martial Arts Great Master had arrived at that subtle stage, would he or she be able to appreciate the beauty of that single sentence!How could Meng Chao Ran be an exception?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, that simple sentence had completely smashed his plans apart. Once the bottleneck had been shaken, if it was not immediately broken through in a single attempt, then even if he were to use double the amount of strength in his attempt to break through it at another time, he might not necessarily succeed!Since his mental state had been shaken, even if Meng Chao Ran was bent on leaving at that moment, he could no longer do so.\u201cI am not leaving for now. I will need to go into seclusion for a while.\u201d Meng Chao Ran\u2019s gaze momentarily hardened, and he briefly observed Chu Yang. Chu Yang\u2019s expression remained normal, and it was as if the sentence which he had spoken were words said without any other intention. Meng Chao Ran helplessly began to smile.He had earlier just said that he was leaving, but following that, he instead said that he was no longer leaving. Those kind of unpredictable decisions would originally, most easily, result in the person being held in contempt, but Meng Chao Ran did not seem reluctant, and had just said that out in such an indifferent manner. It was as if that sort of thing was a very common affair.\u201cMmm, right. This Spring and Autumn Elixir, Chu Yang shall take it.\u201d Meng Chao Ran gave a slight smile as he swung a hand. A small jade bottle was hurled over to Chu Yang. Meng Chao Ran then said, \u201cEarlier, Shi Qian Shan had also said that Chu Yang\u2019s injuries will require some nourishment. Just use that as nourishment then.\u201d Within that faint smile of his, there seemed to be a slight hint of a mocking intent that was very much quite meaningful\u2026\u2026Immediately, Shi Qian Shan\u2019s facial expression changed drastically!The Spring and Autumn Elixir was used to raise a person\u2019s martial powers, so how could it be used as a tonic to nourish a person\u2019s blood and body? The sect had that many medicine which could be used to treat injuries, so why should the Spring and Autumn Elixir be used?That sentence of his was only meant to let his Teacher have a bad impression of his other two Disciples, and nothing more. Instead, why did it backfire to the point that the Spring and Autumn Elixir was lost in a single moment?How\u2026\u2026 how did that came about?Chu Yang perceptively noticed the trace of ridiculing intent disappearing as it flashed past the edges of Meng Chao Ran\u2019s lips, and he unintentionally gave a secret, bitter smile. Ah, it looks like that Shi Qian Shan\u2019s deceptive scheme had already been seen through by Teacher\u2026\u2026 It is only, why had Teacher not stopped him all along?Moreover, his Teacher had bestowed the Spring and Autumn Elixir unto him, and that was absolutely due to his \u201cThe Heavens and Earth do not shift, neither does the stone turn amidst the flowing river\u201d. However, that Teacher of his was truly rather tolerant. For him to not even ask\u2026\u2026After some thinking, Chu Yang still decided to momentarily test the waters. \u201cEh, Teacher, this Disciple\u2019s martial powers are insignificant, so taking this Spring and Autumn Elixir will also not be much of a use. You should give it to Eldest Martial Brother instead, right? He will then also be able to achieve a good rank during the Contest of the Peaks.\u201dThose sentences were meant to test if Meng Chao Ran had indeed known Shi Qian Shan\u2019s true character.Having said that, both of Tan Tan\u2019s eyebrows immediately began to twitch up and down frantically in a chaotic manner. He could not wait to cover up Chu Yang\u2019s mouth, and almost opened his own mouth to begin scolding him: Stupid cunt! Stupid cunt! It is not easy for Teacher to give it to you, so you should have just kept quiet after striking it rich. Why are you still so stupid to give it away?Shi Qian Shan\u2019s face also revealed a slight hint of expectation.The gazes of three people simultaneously looked towards Meng Chao Ran. Tan Tan was anxious, whereas Shi Qian Shan\u2019s nervousness and apprehensiveness contained expectations with a slight hint of greed; meanwhile, Chu Yang\u2019s gaze was instead very calm.\u201cIt is not necessary. Your Eldest Martial Brother is also not injured\u2026\u2026 so he won\u2019t be needing that,\u201d Meng Chao Ran said indifferently. He met Chu Yang\u2019s gaze, and gave a momentary slight smile. \u201cBesides, your current domain level is also not much different from your Eldest Martial Brother\u2026\u2026 Mmm, it will be like this then. There is no need to say any further.\u201dChu Yang\u2019s facial expression momentarily became bitter. What Meng Chao Ran had just said obviously contained other meanings. At that moment, he was a Martial Pupil of the Third Grade, while Eldest Martial Brother Shi Qian Shan was instead a Martial Warrior of the Fourth Grade. The difference was not justified by comparing their domain levels, so why did he say \u2018both of your domain levels are not that much different\u2019?The true meaning behind what Meng Chao Ran had said, should be: \u2018Both of your cunningness and insidiousness are already more or less the same\u2026\u2026\u2019 Ah, Teacher, I am innocent\u2026\u2026 ah, I am a pure and honest person\u2026\u2026 Chu Yang shouted out within his mind\u2026\u2026Meng Chao Ran once again took a deep look at that Disciple, then whisked his sleeves, stood up and said, \u201cAll of you had better practise well. I will personally bring all of you to the top of Gathering Clouds Peak three months later!\u201dWith that, Meng Chao Ran unexpectedly left, and his figure immediately disappeared.The three of them faced each other. Shi Qian Shan\u2019s eyes were looking at the small jade bottle that was radiating a soft glow within Chu Yang\u2019s hands, and the muscles of his face uncontrollably twitched twice.All the effort he had put forth, wasn\u2019t it just because of that item? Instead, it was gone right before his eyes\u2026\u2026\u201cEldest Martial Brother, many thanks.\u201d Chu Yang appeared to be very sincere as he gave his thanks towards Shi Qian Shan, and said, \u201cIf Eldest Martial Brother had not proposed that this Younger Brother requires nourishment, then why would Teacher bestow this treasured divine Elixir unto me\u2026\u2026 Speaking of which, ah, this is all due to Eldest Martial Brother\u2019s accomplishments.\u201dShi Qian Shan opened and closed his mouth a few times, and then, with a smile on his face that seemed even more unsightly than if he were to cry, he said, \u201cHow can Younger Martial Brother say that. Teacher had specially intended to bestow it unto you, ah, Teacher\u2019s kindness is really profound.\u201dThe divine Elixir had accidentally flew away from his hand, and unexpectedly, the person who had obtained that divine Elixir even thanked him sincerely\u2026\u2026 He found the situation completely unbearable, yet he did not dare to flare up even a little. The Shi Qian Shan of that moment was already vexed to the extreme, and he was itching to severely slap his own mouth\u2026\u2026 Why do you have such a cheap, bitchy mouth! Why did you have to go and say those sentences?Chu Yang momentarily laughed, then turned over the mouth of the bottle, and a red coloured pill with a red lustre came out. At the very moment when it left the bottle, a rare fragrance permeated into the surroundings. Chu Yang chuckled and said, \u201cI heard that this item is something good, and consuming one will actually increase a year\u2019s worth of martial powers! Although the increase is a bit little\u2026\u2026 ah, but I should also not waste it. I will now be taking it, and will have to trouble Elder and Younger Martial Brothers to help guard and protect me\u2026\u2026\u201dImmediately, Shi Qian Shan\u2019s face momentarily cramped. The increase is a bit little? You actually still resented it and found it to be little? Do you believe if the Heavens will strike you with a bolt of lightning?It should originally have been mine. Instead, it is currently in another person\u2019s hands. Now, this person actually still wants me to protect him\u2026\u2026There was no need to mention how Shi Qian Shan secretly felt. Just as he was about to open his mouth and speak, he instead saw Chu Yang opening his mouth, and the Spring and Autumn Elixir had already been tossed in mid-air. Then, after receiving it with his mouth, Chu Yang ate it in the same way as how someone would eat a broad bean. He even went as far as to chew it noisily, and after smacking his lips, he said, \u201cThere was not much taste\u2026\u2026\u201dShi Qian Shan\u2019s face turned fiercely red, and it was as if all the blood in his entire body had rushed up to his head within a short time, almost coming close to exploding\u2026\u2026In the next moment, Chu Yang\u2019s face suddenly began to flush\u2026\u2026 the effects of the Elixir had already begun.Tan Tan looked on enviously, then smacked his mouth and said, \u201cChu Yang\u2019s luck is really good. He broke his head yet managed to obtain the Spiritual Elixir. Ah, that is one year\u2019s worth of pure martial powers. Ah, that really is a blessing in disguise. Ai, I am such a dashing, elegant and beautiful man, but why didn\u2019t I break my head\u2026\u2026\u201dShi Qian Shan\u2019s heart felt like it was bleeding, but he only gave a dry smile and said, \u201cNot bad, not bad, his luck is not bad\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter Chu Yang had taken the Spring and Autumn Elixir, he could only feel the huge and potent effects of the Elixir beginning to surge, penetrating into his bones and throughout his four limbs almost instantly. The meridian channels throughout his body momentarily expanded, and energy gushed through them, rushing towards the direction of his Dantian\u2026\u2026Unintentionally, he secretly gave a momentary bitter smile: The effects of that Spiritual Elixir was indeed not bad. Although only a year\u2019s worth of martial powers had been increased, given the state of his cultivation at that moment, that single year\u2019s worth of martial powers was already a comparably huge amount of strength. If it was a slightly higher grade of Spiritual Elixir, I am afraid that my meridian channels might really not be able to endure it\u2026\u2026Within Chu Yang\u2019s Dantian, the Nine Tribulation Sword\u2019s Soul suddenly gave off an excited mood. Promptly, as if it had extended a ridiculous antenna, Chu Yang could feel the effects of the Elixir entering into the Nine Tribulations Sword like a hundred rivers converging into a sea, until there was actually not even a single bit remaining.Unintentionally astonished for a moment, Chu Yang thought, Unless, the Nine Tribulations Sword likes doing these sort of things? During my previous life, there was no need to mention this kind of abnormality, even the Sword\u2019s Soul never appeared. Instead, this life is also a joke. It is also all right for it to appear all of a sudden, but it actually still wants to rob me?Unless, all the effects of this Elixir will be used to feed the Nine Tribulations Sword? I won\u2019t be able to fish up even a little benefit for myself?While he was thinking that, after the dim figure of the Nine Tribulations Sword within Chu Yang\u2019s Dantian had absorbed the effects of the Spiritual Elixir, the illusory figure of that sword momentarily shook, and it temporarily gave off faint rays of light. Immediately, a concentrated stream of energy was emitted out from around the sword\u2019s hilt. There was only a very thin thread of concentrated energy, and it was as fine as a strand of hair, but Chu Yang could instead feel a huge amount of energy contained within that single strand of energy\u2026\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAlthough the amount of energy was not as large when compared to that of the Spring and Autumn Elixir, the degree of its purity was more than a hundred thousand times better! From only that very little amount, Chu Yang\u2019s cultivation had actually risen from the peak of a Third Grade Martial Pupil to the middle of a Fourth Grade Martial Pupil!While it was true that a large amount of energy was not required to raise the grade at such a low rank, directly increasing a grade was still enough to make Chu Yang shocked! If it were solely the from effects of the Spring and Autumn Elixir, no matter how, it would not have been possible for him to have his grade increased by one!Unless, the Sword\u2019s Soul also has the ability to purify Elixir effects? Or is it some other ability? Ah, weird\u2026\u2026After that, the Nine Tribulations Sword lazily made a turn within his Dantian, and quietened down. The emotions which it transferred over revealed that it was actually quite dissatisfied, or rather, it held that Spring and Autumn Elixir very much in disdain, obviously finding those \u201cmeager\u201d Elixir effects beneath its notice\u2026\u2026Chu Yang could clearly feel that the Nine Tribulations Sword had used a kind of arrogant expression, similar to a human, to express its disdain\u2026\u2026 This servant, is really quite hard to please\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEldest Martial Brother Has A Stomach Cramp?Chu Yang slowly opened his eyes.\u201cYounger Martial Brother Chu, how was it?\u201d Shi Qian Shan asked hurriedly, since he did not notice any sign of Chu Yang having his martial powers raised.Without knowing why, when people typically achieved a breakthrough, even for their slightest reaction, their entire body would momentarily tremble violently. However, after the Nine Tribulations Sword had transformed the effects of that Elixir, Chu Yang had actually broke through a grade without any indication\u2026\u2026Chu Yang\u2019s gaze was calm, but he could not help considering secretly: This, this is definitely a good method to hide things from people! If other people are to treat me as if I am at Third Grade, while I am in actual fact going to be Fifth Grade, Sixth Grade, Seventh or Eighth Grade\u2026\u2026 ah, how invigorating would it be to fight against them.\u201cIt appears to be of not much use\u2026\u2026 I am still a Third Grade Martial Pupil. Moreover, the effects of the Elixir were too potent, and I could not control them. A lot of the Elixir\u2019s effects were wasted.\u201d Chu Yang endured the pleasantly surprised emotion within his heart, then frowned and sighed. Only after using all of his strength to control his emotions could Chu Yang begin to speak in a frustrated tone, \u201cAh, it is really a waste. If I had known that it would be this useless for me to eat it, it would still have been a lot better for Eldest Martial Brother, you to eat it\u2026\u2026\u201dShi Qian Shan widened his eyes, and it was as if his eyeballs were about to pop out, then opened his mouth, \u201cHurhur.\u201d After those two sounds, his face momentarily turned red, then white, and he finally stood up. With a very unsightly facial expression, he said, \u201cI will go out for a walk.\u201d*Sou* Shi Qian Shan walked out.\u201cEldest Martial Brother seemed quite uncomfortable\u2026\u2026\u201d Both of Tan Tan\u2019s weird eyebrows moved up and down. While looking at the figure of Shi Qian Shan\u2019s back with a little doubt, he said,\u201d What happened to him?\u201d\u201cEldest Martial Brother appears to be very tired these few days,\u201d Chu Yang rubbed his chin, and profoundly said, \u201cHis mind is very tired. Looking at his facial expression, it is very likely that he has a stomach cramp. Can it be that those few days in each month actually came\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOrh\u2026\u2026 Eldest Martial Brother is overly worried; Ai, the same goes for this Purple Bamboo Garden of ours. Teacher does not care about anything, and everything is handled by Eldest Martial Brother. It is no wonder that his mind is fatigued.\u201d Tan Tan\u2019s conspicuous ears actually fanned up and down momentarily, and while deeply believing that he was right, said, \u201cThat is definitely hard on him. Stomach cramps\u2026\u2026 it is also possible. Mmm, Chu Yang, those few days in each month\u2026\u2026 which days are those? Why do I not know that Eldest Martial Brother has this kind of a problem?\u201dTan Tan asked curiously.\u201cErm, for this\u2026\u2026 you will know after you have grown up. Little children should not eavesdrop on people, especially if they are affairs related to adults. Do you understand?\u201d Chu Yang cocked his head, seemingly lecturing in a decent manner.Both of Tan Tan\u2019s eyebrows, one of which was higher while the other was lower, trembled a few times as if they were dancing, expressing the doubt within his mind. He resentfully muttered two sentences, and no one knew what he had said, then stopped speaking.Chu Yang rolled his eyes, and another idea came into his mind.He remembered that in his past life, Shi Qian Shan had once discovered a Golden Blood Ningpo Figwort Root. He also remembered that Shi Qian Shan had complacently said, on the walls of the rocky cliff at the back mountains\u2026\u2026Although the Golden Blood Ningpo Figwort Root could not exactly increase martial powers, it could instead broaden meridian channels! Moreover, after consuming Golden Blood Ningpo Figwort Roots which were of at least fifty years old, the medicinal effects would remain on the meridian channels, and for people who were below the rank of Martial Artist, whenever they gain a grade, their meridian channels would broaden significantly!No matter the martial skills, energy and strength would always flow through the meridian channels. With broader meridian channels, a person would be able to exhibit even stronger powers. Even if there were two people of the same rank, nothing could make up for the deficiencies between them if the width of their meridian channels were different\u2026\u2026Although the Golden Blood Ningpo Figwort Root would only be useful for people beneath the rank of Martial Artist, a person\u2019s meridian channels was instead ingrained during that period of time; that might seem to be nothing remarkable, but it would directly determine a person\u2019s lifetime accomplishments!In Chu Yang\u2019s previous life, it was due to the Golden Blood Ningpo Figwort Root that Shi Qian Shan was able to distinguish himself from all the Disciples of Beyond The Heavens Storey\u2026\u2026Chu Yang rubbed his chin and secretly thought: I do not know if that Golden Blood Ningpo Figwort Root has been discovered by Shi Qian Shan. If he hasn\u2019t yet discovered it, ah, why don\u2019t I gather it and have a taste\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The sky outside was still dark, and Chu Yang secretly crawled up. Looking at the bed opposite, Tan Tan was sprawled across the bed, rhythmically making modulated snoring sounds as if he was singing. Momentarily hiding a smile, Chu Yang swiftly got dressed and walked out of the door.To desire becoming a man amongst men, a person has to suffer the hardest of hardships!His own aptitude was not exactly the best! Moreover, he did not exactly put in much effort when he was a youth in his previous life, and there was already quite a distance between him and his peers. If he did not work off twice the amount of sweat as compared to others, how would he obtain accomplishments that were twice that of others?Within several breaths, Chu Yang arrived at the top of the rocky cliff beyond the Purple Bamboo Garden, and he quietly stood still; his two feet were a shoulder-width\u2019s length apart, and his body was in an absolutely harmonious pose. After a moment\u2019s silence, he began to take action!Chu Yang\u2019s movements were very simple, yet difficult. It was as if both his feet had grown roots, and they did not move, while his legs were straight; his arms were also drooping and stationary. Only his upper body was moving.His head slowly leaned towards the left, then his waist slowly bent downwards to the left, and after forming a right angle, recovered his position; after that, he leaned towards the right; once again, he recovered his position, and then bent forward. Promptly, for his last movement, he bent backwards.It was only those four movements, and he continued to repeat them. However, his bends became even lower after every cycle, and after the time it took to burn a joss stick, Chu Yang\u2019s body was bent like a bow which had been completely pulled back, his head was already touching the surface of the ground!Those were waist exercises!The strength of the waist was the most critical part of a person\u2019s body, and was therefore placed at the forefront.After doing those four movements, Chu Yang immediately began to exercise his legs, followed by exercising his ankles, thighs, elbows, wrists and shoulders, to the point that his movements also became faster. Finally, his entire body was like a blade of grass in the midst of a violent storm, and was already lurching between the various range of his body\u2019s movements\u2026\u2026After completing six repetitions, Chu Yang\u2019s head and body were already giving off heat. His entire body was trickling with sweat, soaking his clothes, and droplets of sweat dripped downwards from his hair.However, he did not even pause to rest. Turning over a hand, a chilling ray of light reflected off the item in his palm \u2014 it was a cyan steel long sword.It was only after completely exercising the entire body\u2019s critical muscles, that practising with the sword would produce the best results. If he were to rest, the muscles and bones would return to their original taut condition, and he would not be able to perform many positions during his practise with the sword.That was part of a minimum general knowledge that a martial artist would be required to know, and for martial artists who were capable of doing that for every single practise, there were only a rare few. Those actions represented perseverance and willpower that was capable of sustaining for a long period of time.However, Chu Yang knew how important those kind of exercises before practise were. If any single little detail or small piece of muscle is to be neglected during practise, then if he was to face against enemies of the martial society in the future, during the time when he needed to use those complex and powerful techniques, he would taste the result of not practising properly.The initial difference might be slight, but there would be a significantly large difference from the final result. On the morality behind protecting a person\u2019s own life, regardless if it was only a slight difference, that could also be the difference between life and death! At the very moment before their deaths, how many people had regretted their initial decisions of not practising their martial skills properly? That number of people was extremely large, and it was as if there were quite a few tens of thousands, or even several tens of thousands of people who regretted every year. However, during those final moments of regret, it was already completely useless!Chu Yang did not wish for himself to have that kind of a regretful moment.That was why he never dared to negligent or careless during the time when he was practising! No matter which kind of martial technique, even if they were considered to be the most fundamental movements, he would also practise until it was most suitable and perfect.Sword techniques, fist techniques, leg techniques and palm techniques, after Chu Yang had completely practised them several times, a slight bit of brightness then slowly began to rise from the east.Chu Yang strolled to the top of the rocky cliff. Facing the east, he overlapped both his hands and placed them above his Dantian, then sat down cross-legged and began to breathe out stale air while breathing in fresh air!It was only purely breathing out stale air and breathing in clean air, but between each intake and output of air, there was something rather unusual. When he breathed in, it was as if there was a slight trace of purple in the air from the Heavens and Earth being breathed into his mouth. Then, with his mouth closed, his Dantian spiralled a complete rotation. After that, the breath of air slowly permeated into the five viscera and six bowels within his body. When everything was still, Chu Yang then opened his mouth and violently exhaled!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA long exhalation of that mouthful of air!From within his mouth, a slight hint of dull colour in the air could be vaguely seen as Chu Yang exhaled that mouthful of air out. After completely exhaling his breath, he closed his mouth; his Dantian again spiralled a complete rotation\u2026\u2026Immediately, he once again continued to begin breathing in and breathing out\u2026\u2026That kind of breathing technique, as well as Chu Yang\u2019s earlier method of exercising his body, they were both engraved on the body of the Nine Tribulations Sword in Chu Yang\u2019s previous life. Performing them would completely get rid of the body\u2019s impurities, and absorb from the innate true flames of the Sun!To prepare for his practise of the Nine Tribulations Of The Nine Heavens Divine Technique in the future, he was training his foundations!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 8 \u2013 Golden Blood Herbchu Yang was very well versed in the teachings of the Nine Tribulations Transcending the Nine Heavens Technique. If he were to train at this time then there would be no mistakes, but the only problem was that he could not train at this time!Because the Nine Tribulations Transcending the Nine Heavens Technique has one major requirement. Knowing the teachings alone would not have any use. You must have the sword along with the teachings; then you must absorb the mystical energy from the sword to have the power to practice Nine Tribulations Transcending Nine Heavens Technique!Moreover, each sword fragment had a different mystical energy.If you were to practice without a sword fragment, then it would be likely that your internal energy would burn and you would die!Secondly, Chu Yang\u2019s body, in its current condition, did not meet the requirements to practice the Nine Tribulations Transcending the Nine Heavens Technique. Only when his body reaches the Martial Warrior level, and all of his meridians channels are opened and his qi goes beyond the primary natural cycle and enters the higher natural cycle. At that time, he would have the ability to practice the Nine Tribulations Transcending the Nine Heavens Technique.Dawn was approaching in the east and the light was appearing on the horizon. Chu Yang took a deep breath and slowly absorbed the energy. He stood still for a moment, feeling a warmth in his body, a feeling of pleasure that cannot be described in words\u2026He continued to stand like that, squinting his eyes and looking in the direction of the Gathering Clouds Peak, the place where the first fragment of the Nine Tribulations Sword lies quietly buried under the earth.I must quickly acquire it!His eyes sparkled.He looked for a while before taking his gaze away. He carefully looked in all four directions for a moment. After verifying that there was no one around, he started to move. Suddenly, he slowly descended from the cliff. His eyes constantly scanning, looking carefully at every place. Because, if Shi Qian Shan did not lie, then on this rock face was the where the Golden Blood Herb grows!The Golden Blood Root is actually not a supreme elixir. However, even in the Three Higher Heavens Territory, this is the kind of thing you cannot buy with money. All the big clans, need to use this root to help set the foundation for their descendants.Children from these big clans, from birth, they were already fed the Golden Blood Root! Taking the advantage of the energy from child\u2019s mother that hadn\u2019t dissipated yet, a peak martial expert can help the child absorb all the energy of the root. Then this child would definitely become a talented martial cultivator of earth-shattering potential!If this rare talent worked hard, his future ability would be beyond imagination! And these achievements would be the direct result of this one elixir that was used when he was a child.Martial students from powerful clans learn quicker because of one main reason: they never lack in cultivation resources!On this earth, there was no lack of heaven-sent talents! Talents were those with more opportunities to succeed than other people!But there were a few things that could not be denied: in this world, there were more talents that would die young or become unable to advance than those that can push forward and succeed!I may not be a talent, but I want to change. To make myself even more talented than those heaven-sent talents! I want to make it so that when those talents stand next to me, they can no longer be called talents.Chu Yang slowly walked down, even though his whole body is clinging to the smooth vertical cliff face. He was like a rock worm, steadily climbing straight up.This was because in his previous life, when he killed a certain martial artist, on his body Chu Yang found a technique called Unholy Movement and he thought it was a useful technique, so he practiced it.Right then, he was using it; even though his current body never practiced it, he could still force it\u2026A rustling sound suddenly came from below, a gust of rancid air came upon him. Chu Yang\u2019s eyebrows rose and his eyes widened. His right hand clung tight to the rock face. His whole body flattened against the rock face.Szzz!A poisonous snake with a bright colorful body slithered across his body!If he had not move earlier, he would have been bitten by the snake.A smile appeared on Chu Yang\u2019s face. This place definitely has the Golden Blood Herb. Moreover, it was the type that is more than 100 years old!This snake\u2019s body had more than 7 colors, was as large as an arm, and its head had one color. It was a Seven-Colored Golden Radiance Snake. Wild Golden Blood Herb might have a Seven-Colored Golden Radiance Snake protecting it. This was the reason why, after seeing the Seven-Colored Golden Radiance Snake, Chu Yang came to the conclusion that the Golden Blood Herb was here. That type of snake has very tough skin; normal weapons would have difficulty causing harm to it, it was also especially poisonous. Normally the weak spot of any snake is 7 cm from its head, but with that kind of snake, it was not.Its weak spot was the radiance on its head!Golden Blood Herb of over a hundred years old would exude a very strong aroma. This aroma was especially attractive to the Seven-Colored Golden Radiance Snake. The aroma could help the Seven-Colored Golden Radiance Snake shed its skin without any pain or suffering!To the Seven-Colored Golden Radiance Snake, eating the Golden Blood Root would not have any benefit. The smell was what it loved.The sound started again. The Seven-Colored Golden Radiance Snake turned back, aiming in the direction in the direction of Chu Yang and headed straight for him. It beat its tail with a bang on the rock face and sent its body forward towards Chu Yang, wanting to bite him. Chu Yang\u2019s gaze narrowed and his body was completely still. He waited until it was about a meter away, then he moved extremely quickly. One could only see that his body suddenly moved to the right. Then it arched higher. His whole body become contorted in an unnatural position. The Seven-Colored Golden Radiance Snake shot right by his body, missing him barely. In the blink of an eye, Chu Yang\u2019s two fingers formed a sword, concentrating all of his qi to them and ferociously stabbed the snake at its weak spot.Pow!A paralyzing scream rang out and the Seven-Colored Golden Radiance Snake writhed painfully, with the radiant spot on its head bleeding black blood, mixing with the seven colors. It rolled from the cliff face straight to the ground.Chu Yang breathed a sigh of relief. He turned in the direction the snake came from and carefully climbed over. In truth, he could go faster, but he was afraid he might inadvertently damage the Golden Blood Root\u2026\u201cA Golden Blood Root of more than a hundred years old\u2026\u201d Chu Yang was full of excitement. This was truly a treasure. Only a root of fifty years would be enough to get good results, moreover it would help sustain future progress. Then a root of more than a hundred years would give what kind of results?!Moving a little further down, Chu Yang dreamily smelled a faint aroma. It was extremely calming and refreshing, like the smell of the Snow Wind Orchid. Although its aroma was not strong, it had a lingering effect on people. Chu Yang was joyful. Normal Golden Blood Root had always been without any color or flavor, only the kind that\u2019s more than a hundred years old would have a faint smell. This smell was actually not very different from other aromatic Herbs. If it were to grow where other plants thrived, then it would be indistinguishable.Luckily, this one was growing on a cliff face! An aroma like this on a cliff face definitely stands out.Chu Yang carefully inched himself. He could see on a rock a few blood red leaves on a rock, gently swinging in the wind. Beneath these rocks is a hint of the herb showed. It was also red like blood.This is truly Golden Blood Root!Climbing down a little further, setting himself in a steady position, Chu Yang pulled out a sword. He concentrated his qi into the sword and then he stabbed it down into the rock face with all his might. Half of the sword went into the rock. His two legs carefully stepped on the sword. Pulling out another sword, he started digging cautiously.He brought two swords with him, one of them belonged to Tan Tan. Early this morning, he snuck out with it. Tan Tan was still asleep at the time. If he knew that his precious sword was used as a digging tool, what would he think?One part digging, one part thinking, Chu Yang could not fathom this feeling of excitement. This feeling surprised him: My elder martial brother was always truthful and kind, not the kind of person to play others like this\u2026 (TLN: basically Shi Qian Shan wasn\u2019t lying, so Chu Yang is super happy \u2013 thanks to yuigahama)Not long after, Chu Yang\u2019s body was soaked in sweat. All the digging effort revealed a cave, small enough to force a body through. With difficulty he entered the cave, breathing a sigh of relief, but he did not rest. Immediately, he took his hands and pushed away all of the red leaves of the Golden Blood Herb to find its root. He paid special attention to keep a safe distance of 3 meters around him and then started the excavation.With every rock he dug up, Chu Yang carefully placed them next to him to keep them from falling down. When he could no longer keep them from falling, he started to put them on the side of the cliff, letting them fall down along the cliff, being careful to make as little noise as possible to avoid anyone\u2019s attention\u2026Although this area seemed desolate, it was better to be careful. No need to invite unnecessary trouble that could be avoided.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe digging took over an hour. Chu Yang\u2019s whole body was soaked in sweat. Finally, the top of the Golden Blood Root was visible, radiantly a hazy, dreamy light as if its body had blood moving within.The whole Golden Blood Herb, even its skin, was not damaged in anyway. The root was intact and fat like two fingers. He took his hands and gently touched it. It felt like touching a swollen ripe peach.\u201cThis is really the good stuff! It looks like this Golden Blood Root is almost two hundred years old. No wonder why in the previous life, Shi Qian Shan progressed so quickly\u2026 that punk! So it was because he found such a precious thing.\u201dNow it belongs to me!Chu Yang panted heavily, scanning the root from top to bottom, his eyes full of happiness. In truth, he never imagined that it could be this good!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 9 \u2013 The True Master of Nine Tribulations SwordWithin the Golden Blood Root is the liquid elixir. The older the age, the more liquid there is and the better the result. And only this liquid elixir has true results. If digging with ignorance, once you accidentally cause the root to have a scratch, the liquid inside will quickly pour out. Then, even swallowing the whole root will be the same as eating any other root.Chu Yang stood on the rock face, normalizing his breath to calm down. He put the Golden Blood Root into his mouth and chewed gently; a stream of cool liquid poured out into his mouth. The liquid had a golden color, glimmering with light.The name Golden Blood Root actually came from this. This is truly golden blood!The moment the liquid elixir entered his body, it slowly spread through all the meridian channels in his body. Right at this time, the sword spirit in his dantian suddenly exuded a joyful feeling. It seemed to suddenly have burst out of his dantian and consumed all of the liquid elixir before his meridians had a chance to absorb it.Chu Yang could not believe the feeling of satisfaction let out by the Nine Tribulations sword spirit. Then it slowly returned to the dantian; an action like it had just went for a walk after it had a feast.Even though he was still clinging to the cliff face, Chu Yang let out a laugh. This thing actually has a personality, eh?Immediately a golden light flashed on the body of the sword spirit. At this time, it was clearly much brighter than it was before. This radiance immediately disappeared. From the sword, a cold energy radiating a dark light poured out and went forth into the meridian channels all over his body. Chu Yang was stunned as he saw a light shine on his skin and then disappear. All of his meridians inflated like a toad and then deflated again and then inflated again\u2026 He now looked like a balloon, looking like he was being blown up and deflated and blown up again\u2026This happened continuously nine times, when finally it all passed.The medicinal power of the Golden Blood Root Elixir, after going through the sword spirit, was transformed and finally joined with his meridians\u2026Testing his meridians by activating them, Chu Yang now felt they were extremely malleable, like durable balloons that could not be broken. At this Chu Yang was crazily happy.This harvest will create a foundation for all my achievements in life! A truly large harvest\u2026 Even though the martial power did not increase, it transformed all the meridians. And my road toward the True Way will be much easier!If other people\u2019s meridian channels were small ponds, then there is no doubt that mine is a deep well. This is the difference in our nature!He was not done celebrating when he felt the sword spirit inside him suddenly exude a light of great brilliance to the point that it made Chu Yang felt like his body became translucent. After that, his dantian had a feeling of pain; the light disappeared within the blink of an eye. But Chu Yang knew that something mysterious was happening\u2026Suddenly, within him, these verses appeared:\u201cThe Way of the Heavens without love, then all things will be destroyed;The Way of the Heavens with love, then all things will be created.The Way of the Sword without love, kills people;The Way of the Sword with love, the heart values life.With love, without love, it depends on you.Nine lives, nine tribulations, without love is also with love.With love is without love;\u2026 (TLN: this line was too obscure)With love is also without love;Without love is also with love;With love, without love, the understanding is hidden within.That is the Way of the Heavens.With people, come martial arts, take martial arts to learn the Way of the Heavens, and in the end is transcendence.In the secular human world, the secret to the Way of the Heavens is also there.Human emotions, the root of the Way of the Heavens\u2026\u201dChu Yang\u2019s whole body started to shake, his emotions were shaken up. His head dizzy, his eyes blurry; he almost fell off the cliff face. At this cliff face, without any witnesses, his whole body convulsed almost uncontrollably.In his previous life, he worked hard to cultivate without hesitating to use the dark arts to push forward, killing to advance his Sword Art. But he still could not understand the pinnacle of Martial Arts. At this time, Chu Yang realized where he was at.So in the previous life, I was wrong to cultivate the Way of the Sword without love. This was one hundred percent wrong.This was the overall principle verse of the Nine Tribulations Transcending the Nine Heavens Technique!What is without love or with love? All is in the heart. The heart without love, that is the Way of the Sword without love. But the heart with love, that is the Way of the Sword with love.Deep cultivation is the Way of the Heavens!In my previous life, it was clear that I was full of love, but time and time again, I tried to destroy love. No wonder I could not succeed!One and the same goal, but two different roads. One to become a Saint and another to become a Demon! How to cultivate, it\u2019s all within the heart\u2026\u201cQing Wu, it turns out I was wrong! From the beginning, I was wrong! And so, this led to the tragedy of our lives.\u201dChu Yang faced the sky with pain in his heart. Oh Nine Tribulations Sword! Oh Nine Tribulations Sword! How you toyed with me! You caused me to destroy a lifetime all because of a misdirection, only to bring me back again!In the end, should I hate you or thank you?In Chu Yang\u2019s emotional state, he did not realize that at the tip of the Nine Tribulations sword spirit in dantian, there were a few black spots, which were difficult to detect!The sun just rose, outside of the Purple Bamboo Garden, two people could be seen approaching. One young man, one young woman. They both wore white clothes, their sleeves fluttering with the wind in a forest of purple bamboo, making them seem unearthly. The young man had eyebrows like swords, his eyes were bright. His appearance was heroic, but there was an air of arrogance and confidence on his face that causes others to feel pressured. The young lady was about 17 or 18 years old, with a perfect beauty like a painting. She was tall and lithe, with a serene face, making people who looked at her think of the word \u201cgentle.\u201d Those who do not know her personality would have this impression.A weak appearance, but a strong posture; an appearance of unyielding bravery, but a feeling of flexibility like water.\u201cDisciples Li Jian Yin of Locking Clouds Peak and Wu Qian Qian of Gathering Clouds Peak, following Masters\u2019 orders to see Martial Uncle Meng. Martial Brothers, please help notify the Master.\u201d The young man in white called out.His voice traveled far without dissipating, showing that he has cultivated high internal energy.Locking Clouds Peak is the second-ranking peak, and today, came here with Gathering Clouds Peak. But today they were disappointed, because no one from the Purple Bamboo Garden answered them.At this time Tan Tan was cultivating with Shi Qian Shan deep in the Purple Bamboo Forest, therefore they could not hear noises from the outside. As for Meng Chao Ran, it was not known where he went. Therefore, there was no one to answer.Li Jian Yin called out again, but still no one answered. Grimacing, he unhappily said, \u201cThe people of this Purple Bamboo Garden, are they still not up yet?! How come I can\u2019t even hear a breath?\u201dAfter hearing him, the young lady furrowed her eyebrows, and said softly, \u201cJunior Martial Brother Li, please be careful with what you say. This is Purple Bamboo Forest, do not let others hear that. It could make Junior Martial Uncle Meng unhappy.\u201d\u201cJunior Martial Uncle Meng? Ha ha\u2026\u201d the young man laughed bluntly, but said with a low voice, \u201cThis Martial Uncle Meng, I heard that if people rode on his head, he wouldn\u2019t get mad\u2026 this kind of person, lacking in courage like this, I cannot fathom how he managed to become one of the Ten Great Disciples back then!\u201dAfter this, the young lady became scared and said, \u201cJunior Martial Brother Li, before coming here, what did your parents tell you? They said, when we talk, we have to be one thousand times more careful. Why is Junior Martial Brother\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe did not finish her sentence when a cold \u2018hmmph\u2019 rung out from behind them.A cold voice went forward, \u201cHow did my master manage to become one of the Ten Great Disciples is none of your concern. You are not in the position to ask that question. However, I want to ask you, how did a disrespectful egomaniac become a disciple of Locking Clouds Peak? Do you have a lot of money? Or is your father powerful?\u201dThe voice was ice cold and the questions raised sounded cruel, startling all those who heard it. The gaze behind the voice was unsettling.The two were unnerved; they quickly turned around in the direction of the voice, to see a young man covered in grime. At first glance he seemed dirty, but there was a keen light radiating from his cold stare. This youth has a thin and tall build, with sword-like brows and thin lips. Initially, he did not seem handsome or heroic, but looking carefully, one could see something special in him. His lips curved, forming a down-turned bow, creating an expression of arrogance, giving a feeling of brutal aggression. Now, his eyes were like two swords; his gaze so sharp, that others dare not look at!This youth was Chu Yang!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 10 \u2013 I am not as petty as youAfter Chu Yang ate the Golden Blood Root, he continued to climb down to the bottom of the cliff. At any rate, the gallbladder of the Seven Colors Golden Radiance Snake was a very rare item. It could be used to cure poison; there was no point in wasting it.After taking care of everything, he went in full circle and then went back home. He did not expect to see two people standing in front of the Purple Bamboo Garden. One of these two is talking rudely about my master! In anger, he coldly responded. As this person announced his name, Chu Yang knew right away that this was the only son of the Master of Locking Clouds Peak, Li Jinsong.Chu Yang responded in kind, you badmouth my master, I\u2019ll badmouth your father!No matter if it was the previous life or this life, Chu Yang was never willing to lose to anybody.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Li Jian Yin asked with a crestfallen face.Chu Yang laughed heartily and like that, he quietly looked at Li Jian Yin with a mysterious gaze. Earlier he already said \u2018my master\u2026\u2019, therefore revealing who he was, but it was surprising that Li Jian Yin still asked a question like that.Clearly, he is in awe of my power; his spirit is shaken up. A situation like this, there is no point in answering.A person like this is not worth my respect!At the same time, he also noted quietly that anger caused the sword spirit to rise and manifest itself needlessly. This situation cannot happen again\u2026Moreover, everything can be compensated for. All regrets can be done once more.The Chu Yang now was like this poem:A horse enjoying the spring wind, runs faster.A person who encounters a happy event, has a clear state of mind.When elation rises, one\u2019s magnificence is boasted.A cheerful book, closes faster.The world is beautiful, life is full of hope, how can one scoff at that? Even if you want to, you cannot. (TLN: the undecipherable poem and the previous lines basically mean that Chu Yang was in a good mood from having the chance at life once again, therefore he shouldn\u2019t mind Li Jian Yin too much)He especially paid attention to the way his sword spirit manifested itself uncontrollably, which can lead to unwanted situations.With my current low martial power, it is perhaps best to leave it as it is.\u201cAre you a disciple of Purple Bamboo Forest?\u201d noticing that his opponent didn\u2019t answer, Li Jian Yin asked once again.Chu Yang shook his head and looked in the direction of the young lady, not wanting to pay any attention to Li Jian Yin. Even though his personality has changed, his arrogance was steeped to the bones. He didn\u2019t want to spare another glance at a person like Li Jian Yin who couldn\u2019t even understand what other people were saying.Li Jian Yin was livid; his opponent had looked down on him without any tact. It brought out his desire to kill!\u201cExcuse me, you, are you Chu Yang, are you Junior Martial Brother Chu Yang, disciple of Junior Martial Uncle Meng?\u201d The young lady smiled and asked gently, in a most ceremonious manner.\u201cIt is I. Are you Elder Martial Sister Wu, daughter of Older Martial Uncle Sect Master of Gathering Clouds Peak?\u201d Chu Yang gave a short laugh. One glance earlier was already enough to let him know.Indeed, this beautiful and serene young lady was Wu Qian Qian, the daughter of Sect Master of Beyond the Heavens Sect.The number one beauty of Beyond the Heavens Sect.Also, the poor girl that was tricked by Shi Qian Shan in the previous life. Even though that marriage did not become a tragedy of the sect, it still was an event that brought many regrets.\u201cSo, it is Junior Martial Brother Chu Yang,\u201d said Wu Qian Qian smiling softly. \u201cOnly, you are not as people said. Earlier I had almost not recognize you.\u201d\u201cSurely Elder Martial Sister is joking,\u201d Chu Yang said casually. \u201cChu Yang is Chu Yang, there is nothing different. Only the rumors were erroneous.\u201dIn Wu Qian Qian\u2019s mind, she felt that there was something mysterious. She was the daughter of the Sect Master, as well as the acknowledged number one beauty of the Beyond the Heavens Sect. Any young disciple of the sect who meets her would get tongue-tied and befuddled. And yet, this Chu Yang time and time again has looked upon me no differently than a block of wood.Actually, it is not because Chu Yang did not see her beauty. It was because his heart already belonged to Mo Qing Wu and all his thoughts are filled with longing for her. There was no room to spare. Even if Wu Qian Qian was a fairy, in his heart it would make no difference\u2026Though Wu Qian Qian didn\u2019t like the suffocating feeling of people clinging and sucking up to her every day, being completely ignored by a person was a first for her. Moreover, she heard of the three disciples of Junior Martial Uncle Meng. The first was very stable, deep thinking, hard-working; a youthful talent for the sect. The second disciple, Chu Yang, had an odd personality and was an introvert. The third, Tan Tan, was someone who completely didn\u2019t know his place\u2026But today, she could see that this young man was not an \u2018introvert.\u2019 Although it was said that he was a little \u2018extreme\u2019, but if you looked carefully, you could feel a hint of arrogance, but\u2026 this arrogance was not that of a normal person!Li Jian Yin was one of those who secretly admired Wu Qian Qian; she had been his object of affection for a long time now. He always imagined that one day he could marry her. Then not only would he have the beauty, he would also become the son-in-law of the Sect Master\u2026However, unexpectedly, Wu Qian Qian was walking with Chu Yang, laughing and talking. A flame of jealousy erupted within Li Jian Yin. He noticed that Wu Qian Qian seemed to be dazed, with her eyes fixed on Chu Yang. The scene gave a feeling of \u2018love at first sight\u2019\u2026The flame of jealousy reached his head and he even forgot the reason why they came; he walked angrily forward and inserted himself between the two. Laughing coldly, \u201cAnd here, I thought it was someone else, turns out it\u2019s just the retard of Beyond the Heavens Sect!\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s the retard calling a retard?\u201d Chu Yang asked angrily with his cold gaze. His spirit suddenly became powerful and oppressive.\u201cThe retard, of course, who else?\u201d Under Chu yang\u2019s oppressive spirit, Li Jian Yin did not back down; without thinking, he answered directly.\u201cNot bad, a retard is actually badmouthing me,\u201d Chu Yang said with admiration, \u201cThis person\u2026 you\u2019re actually not that simple. A person who can understand what his good points are, in this wide world, there are certainly not that many. I really didn\u2019t think that Elder Martial Brother Li belongs in that group. I, Chu Yang, am sincerely in awe.\u201d (TLN: Basically, there was a bit of wordplay in Chu Yang\u2019s previous question. Literally, he said \u2013 \u2018Retard, who are you calling?\u2019 It could be taken as who are you calling retard or hey, retard, who are you calling.)Li Jian Yin was momentarily trapped; he felt sick to his stomach.Wu Qian Qian, standing to one side, was barely able to hold in her laughter. Even though she tried to control herself, those phoenix eyes had widened like a full moon\u2026\u201cYou want to die?!\u201d Angered to the point of madness, Li Jian Yin suddenly he pulled out his sword. \u201cPull out your sword! I challenge you to a duel!\u201dBeing shamed in front of the person you love, how could Li Jian Yin not go crazy?\u201cNo, thanks. I don\u2019t need to duel. I admit\u2026\u201d Chu Yang spoke seriously. \u201cI am not as petty as you.\u201dImmediately, he added, \u201cIn that\u2026 I am truly not equal to you\u2026\u201dWu Qian Qian, at this time, couldn\u2019t hold it anymore and laughed out loudly. However, she regretted it right after. These two were already at each other\u2019s throats; was her laughing was not like pouring oil on the fire? She quickly covered her mouth with her hands, but still, her eyes were laughing.Li Jian Yin got even more enraged, cursing loud, \u201cDisrespectful\u2026!\u201dChu Yang also didn\u2019t let it go and responded, \u201cDisrespectful, who are you talking about?\u201d (TLN: Same sort of wordplay as last time, he is referring to Li Jian Yin as a disrespectful person.)\u201cDisrespectful cursing\u2026\u201d Li Jian Yin did not finish his sentence when he realized he fell into Chu Yang\u2019s trap again. Embarrassed, he screamed out,\u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201d (walkthejianghu.com)Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWith that, he advanced forward with his sword.Chu Yang continually moved backwards with an expression of terror, he yelled,\u201d You\u2019re crazy! You dare try to kill a martial brother in broad daylight?\u201dBut at the same time, while backing up, Chu Yang had been paying attention to the whole situation. He quietly focused his Qi to his foot, a stream of pure energy poured out from his Yong Quan Point at the bottom of his foot. In the blink of an eye, the energy seeped into the ground.Punk! You have carelessly underestimated your opponent. Wait and see how your father mocks you to death\u2026 (TLN: your father is a common insulting way to refer to yourself; everyone understands, right?)Just by going with the flow was enough for Chu Yang to mock him to death\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His heroic aura began to rise once again.On the part of Wu Qian Qian, she forgot to close her mouth. Her eyes were wide open in disbelief. This Chu Yang\u2026 Even though none of his seniors were around, he shouldn\u2019t be this way! Not only did he not dare to fight, he was so scared, he didn\u2019t know what to do. Seeing him from earlier, it didn\u2019t seem like he was this sort of person.Faster than could be said, Chu Yang yelled out, \u201cSomeone save me!\u201dSoon after, as if going limp from fear, he started falling to the ground on his backside. However, at this time, one of Li Jian Yin\u2019s feet had stepped into a strange hole on the ground. The ground was clearly very flat, but for some reason, when Li Jian Yin stepped on it, the hole suddenly appeared.The shape of the hole was actually the same as Li Jian Yin\u2019s foot. As soon as he stepped on it, he discovered that the hole was very deep; moreover, the hole was actually much larger underneath the surface\u2026There was a pitiful cry! When Li Jian Yin ran forward, he exerted all of his energy; being overconfident, he didn\u2019t take any caution. So with a forceful stride, he fell straight to the ground. A loud crack was heard, his ankle was clearly broken.In his experienced eyes, Chu Yang only needed a glance to see all the weaknesses of Li Jian Yin\u2019s martial arts. Even if the trap he set was simple, the opportunity was perfect. If Li Jian Yin had been able to escape\u2026 then he would no longer have been Li Jian Yin.With a \u2018pow!\u2019, Li Jian Yin fell forward. It\u2019s not clear if it was by chance, but Li Jian Yin fell straight forward under Chu Yang\u2019s crotch in one smooth motion. Chu Yang, at the time, being \u2018so scared\u2019, was falling straight toward the ground and ended up sitting on Li Jian Yin\u2019s neck\u2026In an awkward position, Li Jian Yin cried pitifully, but every time his mouth opened he ended up gnawing into the ground.When anyone tries to cry out, they opened their mouths wide. But Li Jian Yin was an especially spoiled child who was afraid of pain; his mouth opened even larger with more than thirty teeth exposed. The mud there was extremely hard. If swallowed, it could really jam up your throat\u2026Chu Yang, sitting on Li Jian Yin\u2019s neck, screamed toward the sky, \u201cOouuuch\u2026\u2026 Such pain, you\u2019re biting my butt\u2026\u201dLi Jian Yin was now half dead; he should be the one crying out. But before he could make a sound, this guy who was sitting on him, without any injuries, had already beat him to it. If based on the pitifulness of the cry, then Chu Yang\u2019s injuries must have been a dozen times worse than Li Jian Yin\u2019s.A scared and confused Wu Qian Qian rubbed her eyes, she could not believe what she was seeing, she continued to rub her eyes. Everything happened so quickly. Before she had a chance to react, it had all ended. Only, the results were beyond her imagination. One side, forceful and aggressive just a moment ago, was now laying on the ground, having difficulty even making a sound. The other, terrified and backing away earlier, was now screaming in pain.Even if Wu Qian Qian was smarter, it was of no use; she was only seventeen or eighteen. She wouldn\u2019t have been able to make sense of the situation.Her mouth was opened wide and her eyes were round; her fingered shakily pointed at the two, but her mouth could not form a word. It was truly beyond words\u2026 How could such a thing happen? How could such smooth ground suddenly cave in like so? It was truly mysterious. And how could Li Jian Yin unluckily step into it just then? This hole wasn\u2019t that deep; with his abilities, how could Junior Martial Brother Li have fallen down? Moreover, in such a bad way.At this time, Chu Yang, while calling out in pain, was holding onto his belt, trying to stand up with some difficulty. Looking at his actions, it seemed that his injuries were serious.Earlier, did I see how he was injured? Wu Qian Qian was full of doubt, but she still ran forward. \u201cJunior Martial Brother Chu, stop squirming, let me help you.\u201dBefore she even finished, Chu Yang let out another pitiful scream. Acting like his waist hurt unbearably and that his body could not stand up; he raised his butt high up, only to fall down again, hard this time\u2026Once again sitting on Li Jian Yin\u2019s neck, this time sitting down even more cruelly!Li Jian Yin, after all his troubles, was finally free from the butt; he had only managed to lift his head for a breath when unexpectedly, that butt fell upon him a second time bringing with it the whole \u2018army of heaven.\u2019 (TLN: really, really, really hard.)Pow!Such tragedy! Li Jian Yin just lifted his head and now his face was smashed deeper into the ground. Right after, a \u2018crack\u2019 rang out\u2026 Luckily there were not many rocks in the area, otherwise, one would dare not predict how bad the outcome would be. Even so, the bones of his nose had been broken\u2026Wu Qian Qian had just reached her arm out when she fell into a stupor once again. Her body was in position to help but she was frozen, with eyes and mouth wide open\u2026 What a pity for her. At this moment, her brain seemed to have shorted\u2026The result was two people on the ground. One was sitting on the neck of the other person, crying and yelling with great pain. He was twisting his behind upon Li Jian Yin\u2019s neck, turning it into a pretzel\u2026 (TLN: an Asian pastry, but pretzel is a pretty good equivalent.)On Li Jian Yin\u2019s part, he was laying on the ground, mouth full of dirt, unable to say a word. His throat was also full of dirt; with great difficulty, he could only moan \u2018Oh\u2026Oh\u2026\u2019At that moment, Li Jian Yin, from his thighs to his ankles, was still in the pit,with his body on the ground forming a parallelogram\u2026 One could imagine how much he was suffering at that time.His ankle was swelling up faster than the naked eye could see, like a balloon\u2026 His remaining leg was now bristling and trembling fiercely\u2026After a long moment of being shaken up, Wu Qian Qian finally moved forward and pulled Chu Yang up. She saw only his pale white face, his trembling body soaked in sweat. He said resenfully:\u201cElder Martial Sister Wu, did you see that? Li Jian Yin is too much! The sect prohibits disciples from fighting each other. Yet Li Jian Yin still wanted to take his sword and kill me! My little life just now was completely in his hands! \u2026 fortunately, my luck was good. Elder Martial Sister Wu, did you two come here to kill me?\u201dFinishing his sentence, Chu Yang suddenly became guarded, like facing enemies. He had a wary and fearful look towards Wu Qian Qian. He said hurriedly, \u201cElder Martial Sister Wu, I didn\u2019t do anything bad. You cannot\u2026 here\u2026 in broad daylight, the sun is still shining\u2026\u201dOn Wu Qian Qian\u2019s pretty face, there was clearly a dark aura\u2026 This guy is talking like this again, as if he were about to get assaulted or something\u2026\u201cHow could that be? We are on orders from father to give message to Junior Martial Uncle Meng, inviting the senior to come over for an important discussion\u2026 geez\u2026\u201dWu Qian Qian patted her forehead, her eyes rolled. She finally remember the reason for coming there.\u201cBut still, I am scared\u2026\u201d Chu Yang leaned on Wu Qian Qian, his whole body seemed to have gone limp in fear, his entire body weight rested on her. Weeping and saying, \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t have any power or backing, my martial arts cultivation isn\u2019t that high. In the sect, my position is the lowest. But Gathering Clouds Peak and Locking Clouds Peak have many disciples and is above all, if\u2026 I poked in the wrong place, I fear I would be forced\u2026 I would be forced to leave\u2026\u201d\u201cNever!\u201d Wu Qian Qian said freely. \u201cThis is nothing!\u201dWhat Poor little miss did not know at this time was that Junior Martial Brother Li\u2019s leg was broken, bones were crushed. Laying on the ground, waiting to be save\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThen\u2026 if the sect asks, Elder Martial Sister Wu will stand on my side and be my truthful witness?\u201dChu Yang continued to buy time, to let Li Jian Yin experience the most immense suffering. He begged, \u201cThe previous events, from beginning to end, you\u2019ve seen it all for yourself. Li Jian Yin dared to insult my master, right? When I arrived, he called me a retard, right? Then, he wanted to fight with me and when I yielded to him, he even wanted to kill me, right? \u2026he drew his sword, slashing murderously, trying to kill me without any mercy, right? I almost got killed, right?\u201dHe continuously used the word \u2018right?\u2019 in an extremely pitiful voice, mindfully leading her thoughts step by step. Wu Qian Qian naturally listened to his words, naturally remembering, thinking about each scene as it happened without any automony and nodded repeatedly. Everything happened as Chu Yang had said, without any deviation.Wu Qian Qian could not help but be a little disgruntled, \u201cThis Li Jian Yin was really too much\u2026\u201dTLN: Dear readers, I can\u2019t help but feel bad for Li Jian Yin. It gets even worse in the next chapter >_<Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Only, the results turned out to be the opposite of what Li Jian Yin expected\u2026Chu Yang was so scared, wiping off a cold sweat, \u201cLuckily, he accidentally fell\u2026 otherwise\u2026 Elder Martial Sister Wu, otherwise I would have\u2026\u201dHe stopped there and did not say anything else. His gaze towards Wu Qian Qian was full of warmth. Only, the phrase \u201che accidentally fell\u201d was truly wicked\u2026\u201cIf not, then you would have been killed.\u201d Poor little miss was clearly being led. She simply added, \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing more to say.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true!\u201d Chu Yang clapped his hands strongly, showing signs of happiness, agreeing with her. \u201cIt is only Elder Martial Sister Wu who truly has great insight and upholds justice, with fairness. Truly, very wise.\u201dWu Qian Qian felt there was something wrong; but thinking back, nothing wrong was said, therefore she dreamily nodded her head. Moreover, she was only a young girl. With so many praises, her thinking had become muddled.At that moment, Li Jian Yin finally lifted his head. Even though he was injured, his ears were not deaf. He heard everything the two said from beginning to end. Hearing Chu Yang\u2019s lies, which had unexpectedly turned him into a bad guy, he almost spat up blood and died.However, in his throat, there was still a large mass of sticky mud. Even if he wanted to spit blood, he could not. Enduring the pain, he pulled the mud from his mouth with hands. As for the mud in his throat, he couldn\u2019t remove it. At that point, he could no longer hold his breath. He could only force his throat to straighten out and swallow the mud down\u2026 There was really no other way. Otherwise, Li Jian Yin would have died from suffocation waiting to get that mud out.Chu Yang and Wu Qian Qian stared at Li Jian Yin as he stretched his neck; it looked like a tiny snake swallowing a small egg. It slowly went down and finally ended with a \u2018gulp\u2019 and disappeared. The neck returned to normal. The two spectators rolled their eyes and swallowed\u2026This was\u2026 truly disgusting\u2026\u201cPlop!\u201d Li Jian Yin finally spat out a clump of blood that was in his throat. His breathing was difficult and strained, making him temporarily forget the pain of his broken leg. Ah, it seems that human misfortune does brings happiness\u2026 (TLN: schadenfreude, taking pleasure from someone else\u2019s misfortune.)Ultimately, this did not last long. An intense pain had pass from his thigh. In addition, the mud that was just then swallowed was causing burning pain in his stomach\u2026Now, Li Jian Yin was just mad that he did not die\u2026 He had just learned something called \u2018agony.\u2019Even though he wanted to curse at someone, he could barely breathe.A moment later, Li Jian Yin finally raised his head and looked at Chu Yang with a menacing expression:\u201cChu Yang! Just you wait, I vow to never let this go! In this life, one of us must die! Owww\u2026\u201dAs he spoke, his body could not stop shaking. He had intended to show his manliness in front of the woman of his dreams, but he could not help it\u2026Trembling, Chu Yang spoke softly, \u201cElder Martial Sister Wu, you see, you see\u2026\u201dWu Qian Qian comforted him, \u201cJunior Martial Brother Chu, don\u2019t worry, I have seen everything. How can I let others persecute you? Junior Martial Brother Li is just venting his anger, you don\u2019t need to take it to heart\u2026\u201dLaying on the ground, Li Jian Yin called out unnaturally, \u201cOhh\u2026 Oh\u2026!\u201d His two eyes rolled in disbelief, staring at Wu Qian Qian, and finally closed:\u201cEverything you already have seen? Everything of what?! You, too, have mocked me to death ahhh\u2026ahhh\u2026 ahhh\u201d (TLN: cries of pain)At that time, Wu Qian Qian finally discovered something out of the ordinary. She screamed in a terrified voice, \u201cJunior Martial Brother Li\u2026 your leg?!\u201dShe had barely finished speaking and still terrified, she immediately was shocked by another reality. \u201cYour nose!\u201dLi Jian Yin, with a face full of tears, banged his head on the ground. Oh, mother! She finally figured it out, then. And she is worried about my injuries\u2026 With his emotions liberated, he unexpectedly cried out loud, \u201cOH! OH! OH!\u201dThe emerging talent of Beyond the Heavens Sect, son of the second most powerful person, was crying in front of everyone\u2026 This scene made Wu Qian Qian extremely confused. She could only widen her beautiful eyes, truly not understanding the whole situation. Was it really that much pain to make him like this or what? We are people of Jiang Hu; we rather shed blood than tears\u2026Wu Qian Qian did not know that Li Jian Yin became that way because of the sorrow, the injustice, in addition to the unbearable pain from wounds on his body\u2026 but in fact, the thing that made him most sad, came from her.At this moment, from Purple Bamboo Forest came a noise. Two people came running out:\u201cWho\u2019s making all this noise? Ah, Chu Yang? What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Before they finished asking, Shi Qian Shan and Tan Tan had reached the scene. Only after stopping did they have a chance to look. The two new arrivals stared with gaping mouths.\u201cElder Martial Brother. You must defend me!\u201d Chu Yang called out indignantly. Since there was already a shield there, why not use it? This was a good opportunity to put misfortune on another. When dogs are biting each other, everyone wants to watch.\u201cEarlier, I almost got killed by him\u2026 Right in front of our home, it\u2019s this guy! First he insulted master and then he called us retards\u2026\u201dAfter hearing that, Shi Qian Shan\u2019s expression became serious. Even though he was normally a composed person, this was inexcusable. If he reacted with indifference to someone who humiliated his teacher, how could he face anyone? How could he compete for the rank of top disciple? Moreover, Shi Qian Shan\u2019s nature was cocky and self-aggrandizing. He always put all effort into being ahead of his peers. He took his senior position as a goal to strive for more. Then how could he today let someone call him a retard?Even if he wanted to endure it, he could not! \u201cIs that true?!\u201dShi Qian Shan\u2019s countenance was grim. His eyes narrowed. He said those words solemnly, not with anger but rather self-respect.Noting that events were about to take a turn for the worse, Wu Qian Qian hurriedly stood up to greet him,\u201cElder Martial Brother Shi, we are at fault in this, Junior Martial Brother Li is still young. He does not know how to hold his tongue. We hope, Elder Martial Brother Shi, can hold back your anger. Do not break the peace between fellow sect members.\u201dWu Qian Qian was extremely humble when speaking these words. Moreover, she was also very charming. What she said was basically the means to neutralizing the situation; however, with her words, she also incriminated Li Jian Yin!As for Shi Qian Shan, his eyes lit up. Before him was a face of heavenly beauty. He glimpsed in a greedy manner, then said with a serious face,\u201cSo it is Junior Martial Sister Wu. If Junior Martial Sister Wu says so, then I will not pursue this matter any further.\u201dThough after saying so, he still seemed upset.Right after Wu Qian Qian had stood up, Li Jian Yin, who was covered behind her earlier, was revealed. One could only see tears and snot running down his face, which was covered in blood. His form so tragic, that he seemed better off dead than alive. This gave Shi Qian Shan quite a fright and he cried out,\u201cWho is this?! And even more so, he is still\u2026 crying?! He\u2019s quickly losing face\u2026 is he not afraid to lose face completely? \u2026 # [email\u00a0protected] &%*, so in the end, who managed to put him down so easily?\u201dHe turned back to Chu Yang, only to see his whole body in dirt and disheveled, but with nothing out of the ordinary\u2026 But in fact, the dirt on Chu Yang came from digging for the Golden Blood Root\u2026Did Chu Yang cause these injuries? At that time, Shi Qian Shan did not recognize the person beaten to a pulp, with blood all over him, was Li Jian Yin. His psyche was still in shock. But his \u2018I will not pursue this matter any further\u2019 had come back to trouble him.\u201cShi Qian Shan! I can\u2019t believe even you want to persecute me! Persecute, your grandfather!\u201d Li Jian Yin cursed between his hacking coughs. There was almost enough resentment to cough up blood. He said, \u201cYou, him and her, as well! Your mother, Shi Qian Shan, I will screw your wife\u2019s sister too! I swear, this whole life, I will not let you mongrels live in peace! I will certainly make your lives worse than death!\u201dSuffering extreme humiliation, plus injuries that may never completely heal, made all the hate in Li Jian Yin\u2019s heart rise intensely. Not only Chu Yang, but anyone from Purple Bamboo Garden were his mortal enemies.Even Meng Chao Ran, he also hated! If he hadn\u2019t taught disciples like these, then how would I have ended up in such a tragic situation?\u201cWon\u2019t let me live in peace?!\u201d Shi Qian Shan\u2019s countenance was motionless. He coldly said,\u201cBy you? You have this capacity? If you like, then go ahead. I will be waiting! Ha ha, you would dare come? I, Shi Qian Shan, will fight with you! If you dare provoke me, hah hah, I, Shi Qian Shan, am also not afraid to kill people!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter finishing his speech, as if feeling that his words were not only manly but also very funny, he laughed, \u201cHa ha!\u201dShi Qian Shan was not an unthinking person. The words he said were natural, but also had reason.Chu Yang\u2019s cultivation ranked lowest amongst the disciples; however, this guy in front of him got beaten to a pulp! So how useless was this guy? Even if there were a hundred of such a person, Shi Qian Shan would not be afraid at all!Moreover, having the opportunity to show his heroism in front of Wu Qian Qian, then why not? Oh, Chu Yang, oh, Chu Yang! You just made a great opportunity for me!Maybe this event will create a shockwave within the sect. All the elders in the sect will perhaps come to value me. Just from being able to meet them, I will have the opportunity make a big splash in one stroke.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was trying to exude masculinity, to attract the attention of Wu Qian Qian, but he didn\u2019t know that she was glaring at him, thinking, is there something wrong with this person? This incident could presently be avoided, why would he say such extreme words?Li Jian Yin\u2026 is someone who could easily be messed with? Not mentioning that his father was the Master of Locking Clouds Peak, his father is also my second Martial Uncle\u2026 In the Beyond the Heavens Sect, besides the elder, he is second only to my father!Even Junior Martial Uncle Meng, your master, is number ten\u2026After hearing Shi Qian Shan say these words, there appeared a vicious smile on Li Jian Yin\u2019s bloody face, \u201cShi Qian Shan, you admit to speaking these words?\u201d\u201cGibberish!\u201d Shi Qian Shan said proudly, full of air. \u201cChu Yang is my, Shi Qian Shan\u2019s, Junior Martial Brother! I don\u2019t care who you are, if you want to mess with my Junior Martial Brother, you have to go through me.\u201dChu Yang thought to himself. Well said! Shi Qian Shan, you are truly talented! But on the outside, he said emotionally, \u201cEldest Martial Brother, little brother is\u2026 I have caused trouble for you\u2026\u201dWith this move, he completely cut off any means for retreat. There was no turning around. (TLN: Lol, for Shi Qian Shan, anyway)Shi Qian Shan, high on his own self-admiration, waved off Chu Yang, and blatantly said, \u201cJunior Martial Brother Chu, what are you saying? We are brothers! What is a little annoyance?\u201dAs he said this, he acted as if he was offended, as if Chu Yang was denying him the responsibility of this matter and looking down on him\u2026Tan Tan on the sidelines did not understand that Chu Yang was playing with these people. He became so emotional, to the point of crying. With tears and snot running, he said, \u201cEldest Martial Brother, oh you are so good\u2026\u201d\u201cTan Tan, you are like that to me too. You are the Junior Martial Brother of I, Shi Qian Shan! If something were to happen to you, this older brother will help you no matter what!\u201d Shi Qian Shan warmly. \u201cI am the Eldest Martial Brother! Naturally, it is my job to protect you from all elements. If not, then are all of the sentiments that we brothers shared over all these years false?\u201dValue honor! Value Love! Full of courage! A man like this, is there any woman under the heavens who would not like? Wu Qian Qian, you\u2026 can hardly be the exception!Shi Qian Shan\u2019s countenance was full of air, looking serious, but furtively glanced at Wu Qian Qian. His heart was full of satisfaction.At this moment, Chu Yang, acting as if he was afraid of the world in chaos, immediately yelled loudly, \u201cGood, with Eldest Martial Brother here, you dare to look down on us? Our Eldest Martial Brother is number one amongst all youths of the Beyond the Heavens Sect!\u201d\u201cJunior Martial Brother Chu, shut up!\u201d Shi Qian Shan frowned and hastily snapped. He immediately said modestly, \u201cJunior Martial Brother Chu, you worship me blindly, these words cannot be said haphazardly. You need to know that misfortune comes from the mouth. Number one, haha, who dares assume that title? Junior Martial Sister Wu, here, is much stronger than me\u2026\u201d (TLN: someone should really take his own advice.)Even though Shi Qian Shan\u2019s reprimand was very modest, in his heart, he was elated to the point that his head was swollen and he was flying on cloud nine.Really, it was not a waste for me to teach you two every day. At this critical moment, you have given me face. The words \u2018Number one amongst all youth\u2019 have revealed Chu Yang\u2019s blind worship of me and proved my expectations!Moreover, I knew exactly when to flatter Junior Martial Sister Wu, showing my heroic demeanor, as well as making the beauty happy\u2026Shi Qian Shan could almost imagine that Wu Qian Qian had begun to fall for him. While Shi Qian Shan was still feeling high-spirited, he did not see that Wu Qian Qian was bowing down to quickly bandage the wounds for Li Jian Yin. Her countenance was becoming increasingly annoyed.This event has become completely blown up! I must quickly go back and tell my father, so they can figure out what to do. Ohh! This is all because Shi Qian Shan! You don\u2019t know anything, yet you\u2019re trying to be a hero. This is so annoying. Li Jian Yin will be sure to exaggerate when he gets back. Then, there will surely be strife between Purple Bamboo Garden and Locking Clouds Peak\u2026Junior Martial Uncle Li, they say that he is extremely a proud person who does not like to show his flaws. With his son, beaten by others like this, how he could he tolerate it? Geez\u2026If it was only Chu Yang, after I tell the story, then Junior Martial Uncle Meng would only have to reprimand him to save face for Junior Martial Uncle Li. Then everything would be over. But who would have thought that Shi Qian Shan, who just arrived and spoke a few sentences, made the situation unamendable. Moreover, the most bizarre thing is that Chu Yang is the cause of this incident, which actually would have been no big deal. All this is because Shi Qian Shan decided to heroically jump in\u2026 Now, it is probably true that Li Jian Yin hates Shi Qian Shan more than Chu Yang\u2026 You say you\u2019re quick-witted and clever\u2026 this had nothing to do with you! Who made you go and intervene?\u201cHuff\u2026 hack\u2026 hack\u2026 huff\u2026 huff\u2026\u201d Li Jian Yin was suffering from shortness of breath, but still smiling. \u201cShi Qian Shan, just remember exactly what you have just said!\u201d\u201cElder Martial Sister, let\u2019s go!\u201d Li Jian Yin was resilient. Unbelievably, he was now standing on the ground with one leg. He glared poisonously at Shi Qian Shan and fiercely left.Unexpectedly, he did not bother to look at Chu Yang!Anyway, he himself was in the wrong first. Chu Yang was unrelated\u2026 it was due to his own imprudence that he stepped into the hole and broke his own leg. The other had nothing to do with it\u2026Talking about this event wouldn\u2019t be any good. This best thing would have been to have secretly dealt with Chu Yang later on. This Shi Qian Shan, though, hmmm\u2026 if I cannot kill him, I am not a Li anymore\u2026The development of this incident made even Wu Qian Qian\u2019s perception a little fuzzy. The person involved had no suffering, the innocent person was now the one with the greatest responsibility. Moreover, this burden was not small\u2026\u201cI still have to trouble Elder Martial Brother Shi to send a message to Junior Martial Uncle Meng. My father wants to invite him to come to Gathering Clouds Peak for a certain matter.\u201d Wu Qian Qian thought for a moment. She felt she would not be able to handle this further, she immediately bid her goodbyes.\u201cJunior Martial Sister Wu is too courteous. Our master is currently in closed-door training. When he comes out, we will pass the message for you.\u201d Shi Qian Shan bowed and gallantly said, \u201cJunior Martial Sister is fragile, if you plan to carry Junior Martial Brother back, it is a heavy burden. Or\u2026 Tan Tan, you go and help this Junior Martial Brother home. Make sure he gets safely back to Locking Clouds Peak!\u201d\u201cYes, Eldest Martial Brother!\u201d Tan Tan complied.Soon Wu Qian Qian said goodbye to Shi Qian Shan and Chu Yang. After a word of thanks to Shi Qian Shan, she immediately turned and left. Never had she expected to feel like she was praying to someone from beyond\u2026 it was as if talking to Shi Qian Shan was like talking to a dead person.Shi Qian Shan watched as the silhouette of the three people slowly disappeared at the end of the road and could not help but smile satisfactorily. Today I have absolutely left a deep impression with Wu Qian Qian!On Chu Yang\u2019s part, despite acting as if there was nothing out of the ordinary, his eyes showed a mischievousness. Certainly, you left an impression, but that impression is\u2026\u201cFor today, I am truly thankful to Eldest Martial Brother.\u201d Chu Yang said earnestly. \u201cIf not, I would have truly met with bad luck.\u201d\u201cThere was no other way,\u201d Shi Qian Shan said with bravado, \u201cJunior Martial Brother Chu, what was that person\u2019s name? Do you know him?\u201dChu Yang said, \u201cJunior brother doesn\u2019t know.\u201dNow you remember to ask for his name? I know his name is Li Jian Yin, the only son of Second Elder Martial Uncle Li Jinsong, one of the spoiled princes of the Beyond the Heavens Sect. But I\u2019m not telling you!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWell, it does not matter that you don\u2019t know.\u201d Shi Qian Shan gave a disdainful humph and spoke as if even if Mount Tai was to collapse, he would still be up to the task. \u201cHis strength was just ordinary. Surely, he is not anybody important. No need to worry about him. Even if he wants revenge, somebody like him would not be able to do anything to anybody. Other senior martial brothers will not let this retard mess with me, Shi Qian Shan. Junior Martial Brother Chu, you can rest easy.\u201dChu Yang said yes and thanked him profusely.It was not until the afternoon, when Tan Tan came back from his errand. His body was covered in dust, his countenance was restless and frightened. When he had returned, Shi Qian Shan was still humming a song while practicing his sword techniques in the yard. He was imagining his beautiful future with each stroke. He moved gently, full of spirit.Chu Yang was then sitting cross-legged in his room, trying to take advantage of the time, trying to increase his cultivation. With real strength, comes the right speak! Chu Yang would absolutely not waste any time that could be used for cultivation.Tan Tan had rushed back, head full of sweat, after speaking a few sentences with Shi Qian Shan. Then Chu Yang heard a \u2018ding\u2019 sound, that was the sword that had fallen from Shi Qian Shan\u2019s hand. Immediately after that, there was a \u2018plop.\u2019 Shi Qian Shan had fallen to ground, with a pale countenance. There was not a drop of blood in his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With one kick, the door flew open. With a never before seen menacing face, \u201cChu Yang, you\u2026 ! Your mother, you dare betray me?!\u201dShi Qian Shan\u2019s leisurely air was gone. His eyes were filled with rage, eyeballs bulging and panting as he spoke.\u201cEldest Martial Brother, where did you hear such a thing?\u201d Chu Yang deliberately breathed a sigh, pretending to not know what to do.Tan Tan also approached and hastily intervened. \u201cEldest Martial Brother, Second Martial Brother also didn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cFart!\u201d Shi Qian Shan panted and bellowed, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me he was Li Jian Yin? You\u2026 why did you screw me over?\u201dShi Qian Shan, feeling righteous indignation, cried loudly. \u201cWhat sort of calamity have I brought upon myself? How could I have been so stupid to cause such a catastrophe? Looks like trouble found me.\u201d\u201cMe, too. Truly you can try to run from the sun, but you can\u2019t avoid the sunlight\u2026\u201d Chu Yang, appearing innocent, called out at the injustice. \u201cEldest Martial Brother! What does this have to do with me?\u201dShi Qian Shan, after hearing these words, felt everything go dark. His face paled and he nearly spat up blood. Listening to this guy was what caused the trouble in the first place, and he dares to say in front of my face \u2018what does this have to do with me\u2019\u2026Even his heart had to twitch.If it was not for you, how would I have scolded Li Jian Yin? If you did not make Li Jian Yin angry, then how could it have escalated to this point? If it were not for you causing this mess, how could I have become so stupid and obtuse\u2026 how could I have been entwined in such a dangerous situation?Now, you, the culprit, will suffer nothing. But I, the innocent one, on the other hand, have become the sworn enemy with Li Jian Yin!And now, you\u2019re even saying pitifully \u2018what does this have to do with me\u2019. You tell me, what does he have to do with you?!Shi Qian Shan breathed loudly, his eyes rolled up; these words have angered him to the point of speechlessness.Chu Yang looked at Shi Qian Shan\u2019s heaving chest and thought lewdly. If it was a woman breathing like that\u2026 hehe\u2026 then it\u2019s definitely worth watching, but this heaving has no allure at all, it is such a failure.\u201cYes, it is like that, Eldest Martial Brother, what does this incident have anything to do with Chu Yang?\u201d Tan Tan scratched his head and said naively. \u201cAt the time, we were all there. Second Martial Brother did not say anything. On the other hand, you, Eldest Martial Brother, full of valor, stood out and defended us. We are filled with gratitude. How could we have plotted against you\u2026?\u201dAll of Tan Tan\u2019s words emanated from his heart. His praises for Shi Qian Shan were very honest. It was true that he looked up to Eldest Martial Brother. But when these words reached Shi Qian Shan\u2019s ears, they became extremely cynical sarcasm.Full of valor? Protect you from the elements? What a laugh! You two calculated very well\u2026Shi Qian Shan\u2019s whole body shook twice. Before his eyes, nothing but darkness. His mouth opened wide, but he did not know what to say. His face looked like a pig!There was a constant pounding in his head making his vision fuzzy and making him feel dizzy. Once more, Shi Qian Shan humphed and with a wave of his sleeve, he walked out. After that, there was a loud dry cough in the yard, followed by what sounded like a groggy mumbling, slowly going quiet.The next morning, when Tan Tan opened the door, he discovered a spot of blood in a bush with a putrid smell that went straight to the nostrils. This made Tan Tan feel pitiful and uncomfortable for many days\u2026 \u201cWhose blood was this? So unnatural.\u201dWhen Chu Yang saw Shi Qian Shan walk out, his eyes revealed a frosty coldness. Shi Qian Shan was very cruel, moreover, he had many plots and conspiracies\u2026 like a poisonous snake. People like that should die as early as possible. But Chu Yang does not want him to die soon!First, from Shi Qian Shan, Chu Yang could learn many things. For example, underhandedness, cruelty, and manipulation. All these things Chu Yang did not have in his previous life, but it could not be left unsaid, that though these qualities are unethical, in a world that worships the powerful like this, these qualities are necessary to walk the Jiang Hu. (TLN: I guess I need learn as well)A great man, in life, must be cruel when the times are cruel. When it is time to joke, then joke. Plot evil schemes whenever necessary!The reason was very simple. All these things were to protect oneself. If you cannot protect yourself, how could you think about achieving great things? It would all be just like a flower in the mirror or the moon in the water. (TLN: useless)Empires can change, people can be good as well as bad. But there is one thing that is always true; if you want your name to be recorded in history, it is a lot harder than leaving a bad reputation. Therefore, good people have to sacrifice so much more then the bad. Few can leave their good name in history. In fact, few people are capable of leaving their name in history.Secondly, right now, there were a few cards that Chu Yang could not show. If others in the sect knew his true strength, then he would encounter many problems. Especially the guys looking towards the top disciple position. Once they know that there suddenly emerged a genius amongst geniuses competing with them, then wouldn\u2019t he become their target?If I become the bulleyes for everyone to aim at, even if I had three heads and six arms, using what little capacity I have now, I fear the result would be tragic!With these things, it was best to have Shi Qian Shan help carry some of the burden like today. Dumping everything on his head was a real pleasure.Theatre was very tiring, how nice to be relieved and watch from the entertainment from the sidelines!There was one additional thing that Chu Yang recognized. He still lacked in many things. Moreover, the path that he chooses in this life cannot be like the one from the previous life. In his previous life he cultivated Sword Art without love. It was possible to cultivate in seclusion deep in the mountain without paying attention to life. However, he will not do that in this life.This life, from the moment I died in my previous life, had already begun to go in a different path!All the things in the previous life that I ignored and did not experience, this life I want to try them all! Previously, my whole life I valued honor and integrity with the exception of a few things. I did not know anything else. (TLN: So, he\u2019s saying he doesn\u2019t really know any Machiavellian schemes\u2026 Could have fooled me\u2026)I cannot hide like the previous life, I will need to experience life. From the mud of life, I will rise, then I can advance to the pinnacle of Sword Art. Then I will understand the Way of the Heavens!Shi Qian Shan\u2026 let\u2019s keep toying with him like that. Let him shield me until his death\u2026 It is really not that bad at all. At least I will have this target to cover me. And I can leisurely observe.Though, he\u2019s not a person of interest to me. But this is not a problem!Of course injuring Li Jian Yin was because Chu Yang was able to accurately predict his next move and deliberately create the trap. Backing up and sitting on his neck was also deliberate.Even though he doesn\u2019t have the super human strength of his previous life, he still retained his powerful foresight. Dealing with a youth who can barely wipe his nose like Li Jian Yin was indeed as easy as the flip of a hand.********************************************************************************************Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGathering Clouds Peak.In the library, Master Wu Yun Liang, with three strands of black hair on his beard, was sitting on a wooden zi dan chair smiling lightly. Next to him was a middle-aged man wearing green/blue qipao. His hairless face seemed very calm. His eyes seemed to show infinite wisdom. He was the master of Dream Clouds Peak, Seventh Martial Brother Kong Jing Feng. He was also a cunning character of the Beyond the Heavens Sect.At that time, Wu Qian Qian stood in front of the two, reporting what had happened. When she talked about the events that occurred at Purple Bamboo Garden, and about the injuries of Li Jian Yin, she herself did not comprehend the actions of Chu Yang or Shi Qian Shan. Wu Yun Liang, who was calm from the beginning until now, along with Kong Jing Feng glanced at each other astonished.\u201cThen, in your opinion, how are these three disciples of Purple Bamboo Garden?\u201d Wu Yun Liang asked softly.Surprisingly, not asking about the injuries of Li Jian Yin, but about the three Purple Bamboo Garden disciples.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hard to say? How is it hard to say?\u201d Kong Jing Feng was very interested, looking at his beautiful niece, he smiled and asked softly.\u201cMy impression of them, compared to all the rumors, there is a big difference,\u201d said Wu Qian Qian as she furrowed her delicate eyebrows. \u201cAccording to rumors, Shi Qian Shan is a mature adept who can take on many responsibilities by himself. Very meticulous and careful. But now he has made me feel very disappointed.\u201d\u201cBut the second disciple, Chu Yang, according to the rumors, he is a reserved, eccentric individual, but honest. Only today, I see that he has potential. He looked like a coward and was afraid of trouble, but inside he actually seems\u2026 \u201cWu Qian Qian thought for a little, unable to find a word to describe her impression. She finally said, \u201cIn short, this person is an enigma. I cannot understand him. As for the third disciple, Tan Tan is exactly like the rumors, he really doesn\u2019t know his place.\u201dAfter listening to her, both men became silent once more, their brows wrinkled tightly.A very long after, Wu Yun Liang stood up and walked slowly towards the wall in front of him. Reaching out with one hand, he revealed a white piece of paper within a painting hung upon the wall. On this white paper, from top to bottom, there was a list of names. A total of forty name, each name had a check mark next to them written in red. (TLN: So I re-read this in the Chinese, surprisingly much clearer than the Vietnamese translation.)There are ten names in the back of the paper with two check marks next to them. There were two names, occupying the first and second places, with three check marks. The names of these two were Xue Ye Meng and Qin Mu Shang.Li Jian Yin\u2019s name occupied position number nineteen and Shi Qian Shan\u2019s name occupied number thirteen. Chu Yang and Tan Tan\u2019s names were not on this paper.Wu Yun Liang took a brush and considered for a moment. He crossed out Li Jian Yin\u2019s name with a red line, erasing the three words Li Jian Yin from the list. After that, he thought a bit. Moving his pen to the bottom, he wrote two words: Chu Yang.Then, Wu Yun Liang added after Chu Yang\u2019s name a mark \u2018?\u2019. After finishing, he took two steps back. He raised his brows and thought. Then he once again brought his brush up and crossed out Chu Yang\u2019s name, leaving only the question mark.\u201cI fear this will cause big waves and strong winds.\u201d Kong Jing Feng said with a frown. \u201cInternally, our Beyond the Heavens Sect is now very unstable. And this happened today. Junior Martial Brother Meng will also be affected by this.\u201d\u201cJunior Martial Brother Meng won\u2019t be affected at all. With his personality, unless the Beyond the Heavens Sect perish, he doesn\u2019t let anything else bother him.\u201d Wu Yun Liang shook his head with an air of confidence. However, after that, his face became dark. \u201cAbout Shi Qian Shan\u2026 is it really true?\u201dSuch air, seems like a paper tiger. (TLN: Wu Yun Liang\u2019s earlier confidence was shaken by the matter with Shi Qian Shan.)\u201cYes,\u201d Wu Qian Qian\u2019s impression of Shi Qian Shan, even though ordinary people call him \u2018mature and respectable\u2019, but in her mind, he was a dim chicken, moreover he was a dim and blind chicken.There is really no cure! Wu Yun Liang breathed a deep sigh.With this event, the two people did not say much. Obviously they also did not hold anything to heart. After all, this was only a childish game of the younger generation. It had no effect on the big picture.Currently on the faces of the two, there were uneasy expressions showing obvious worry.Wu Yun Liang waved dismissively. Understanding this, Wu Qian Qian exited without a sound.\u201cEldest Brother, Little Brother has an idea\u2026\u201d Kong Jing Feng probed.\u201cNo need to hurry,\u201d Wu Yun Liang waved his arm sleeve with a gloomy countenance.Kong Jing Feng remained quiet for a while, then said with a low voice, \u201cSince the founding of the Beyond the Heavens Sect to us, it has only been seven generations. When our ancestors founded this sect, they brought us to the top of world of cultivation of the Lower Three Heavens. We enjoyed the respect of the royal family and a lifetime of honor. But the second generation, right away, had a confrontation with the imperial family of the Great State of Zhao, making the reputation of the school decrease by a thousand meters. All of our experts were hunted and killed everywhere. More than half died. Luckily, two of our ancestors in their old age unwittingly helped the royal family with a great favor. It was then that the confrontation ended. This event helped the Beyond the Heavens Sect slowly reestablish itself, getting back the nine peaks and one garden.\u201d\u201cWith the third generation elders, everyone were great talents. One by one, all exceptional. It was believed that the sect would return to its former prosperity, but unexpectedly, because there were so many talents, it led to internal conflicts of the nine peaks and one garden. After a brutal fight, they killed each other. The Beyond the Heavens Sect once again suffered a major blow. The only thing that could have been done was to issue an order prohibit from fighting and killing each other. Until now, the nine peaks and one garden, with the exception of the garden of Junior Martial Brother Meng, every other place are all secretly plotting, hidden waves are crashing intensely. The ten top disciple from the eighth generation continue in mortal battles. It can be presumed that the Sect will suffer from large losses again.\u201d\u201cThe Beyond the Heavens Sect, those years, went from one of the top schools and depreciated to the point that it is now. Only a second rate school.\u201dKong Jing Feng\u2019s voice started out a little hesitant, but it became more and more heated. \u201cEldest Martial Brother, at first glance, the nine peaks and one garden, seems grand, but every place has its own agenda. Younger Brother thinks that it might be better not to have it at all!\u201d (TLN: he\u2019s saying it\u2019s better to not separate the sect into ten areas)\u201cOur sect is so divided, there are surely traitors. The Beyond the Heavens sect is in a state of great danger. There were Seven Great Sects back then. Today, there are only six remaining. That open position for seventh has been eyed by Hong Chen Xuan and Xin Jian Zhai for a very long time now. They are our strongest opponents! But Divine Sword Pavilion and Black Blood Union both have blood feuds with us. They want to destroy us even more.\u201d (TLN: More characters and sects, I will have to make a character reference sheet soon)\u201cThe destiny of the Beyond the Heavens Sect is now like a bell hanging on a thread!\u201d (TLN: the big bells in temples; basically a precarious situation) With a sad countenance, Kong Jing Feng said, \u201cEldest Martial Brother, we can\u2019t not hurry!\u201d\u201cWhat you\u2019re saying, how could I not know?\u201d Wu Yun Liang breathed a long sigh. \u201cYou\u2019ve only talked about the Jiang Hu and external factors. But our true crisis, you have yet to talk about it.\u201d\u201cOur Beyond the Heavens Sect, these past few years, there are almost six hundred male disciples in the eight generation. Some are useful, but that number is meager. On the part of the female disciples, ten years ago, there were no more than fifty. But now, there is almost one hundred fifty! Although they have limited potential; in looks, they are beautiful like flowers\u2026\u201dWu Yun Liang sighed. He put his hands together and walked to the window. He said quietly, \u201cThis is an omen of the death of our sect!\u201d\u201cBeauty will only invite tragedy,\u201d Wu Yun Liang said casually. \u201cIn a prosperous place like this, beauty is a resource. This is fundamentally the root of our curse. The condition of our Beyond the Heavens Sect now has become very urgent. Only waiting for the eighth generation to walk the Jiang Hu will naturally lead to endless disputes!\u201d\u201cIt is the root of trouble, but it also might be a resource!\u201d Kong Jing Feng dismissively said, \u201cThem walking in the Jiang Hu, that may give our Beyond the Heavens Sect a chance to recruit more support. We don\u2019t yet know.\u201d\u201cDo you think it is possible?\u201d Wu Yun Liang sarcastically smiled. \u201cBeauty in the eyes of the vast majority of the powerful, is only tool.\u201d\u201cCurrently, our Beyond the Heavens Sect suffers from chaos on the inside and enemies on the outside. If we follow your suggestion and force the nine peaks and one garden to become one around one power center, I am afraid that it will immediately cause division! The sect will fall into ruins.\u201d Wu Yun Liang said heavily. \u201cBy then, if our external enemies took the opportunity to attack, our Beyond the Heavens Sect would be destroyed right away.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSevere illness can lead to excessive medicine use. Your words are not bad, however, if you are critically ill, you start to arbitrarily use medicine as you wish, this will only lead to death! Moreover, our enemies from afar, not just these\u2026\u201d Wu Yun Liang paused as if there were something else difficult to say.Unconvinced, Kong Jing Feng said, \u201cSo should we just let it continue to decline? So just go with the will of the sect and let everything slowly go downhill?\u201d\u201cWe need to borrow external powers\u2026\u201d Whenever Wu Yun Liang spoke the word \u2018borrow\u2019 his face became very troubled, stressing each syllable, the look in his eyes was like someone facing drastic measures. Subsequently, he did not say anything and with a taciturn look, he turned toward the wall with the list of the thirty nine names and a single question mark. He looked at the list for a long time without speaking.\u201cBut the other ones\u2026 the females disciples, how to handle that matter?\u201d Kong Jing Feng let out his inner thoughts and immediately rose.TLN: There\u2019s been a bunch of edits since the first few minutes I put this up. I am truly sorry. m(__)mPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But now\u2026 we can only try our best!\u201dKong Jing Feng took a deep breath and said, \u201cThis event with Li Jian Yin, Second Elder Martial Brother will naturally not let this go. Eldest Martial Brother, can you give some thoughts on this?\u201d\u201cSecond Brother has always been hot-headed, he likes to covers his flaws; I am sure he will go after Purple Bamboo Garden.\u201d Wu Yun Liang said casually, \u201cBut he also knows the personalities of his nine martial brothers, so he will only be angry for a bit. He will not do anything himself. As for his disciples, they will surely take action.\u201d\u201cNo matter who wins or loses, this time will be an opportunity for them to hone their skills, for both sides. It will be an exercise for advancement.\u201d Wu Yun Liang said. \u201cAs long as it doesn\u2019t go too far, we don\u2019t need to manage it. If we can find new talents from this, it would not be a bad thing.\u201dThe two became silent. They both raised their heads, looking intently at the 39 names and a question mark on the paper. For a major sect, it was like they were trying to find gold in sand. Whenever a disciple showed some ability, then they were chosen into this list.Only these people! These people were the hope for the future of the Beyond the Heavens Sect. Regardless whether or not Beyond the Heavens Sect creating a foundation or becoming one of the Seven Great Sects or even advancing into the Middle Three Heavens to become a legend of the Lower Three Heavens, all will depend on them. 39 people and a question mark are the elite of the sect.For a major sect like the Beyond the Heavens sect, this was really sad!Kong Jing Feng looked at the names, but inwardly, was thinking of something else. Eldest Martial Brother obviously knew that Li Jian Yin was a petty person who had intentions towards Qian Qian. But still, he let Li Jian Yin go with Qian Qian to give the notice. With Qian Qian\u2019s beauty, of course there would be disciples in the sect who admire her. Conflict would happen for sure, yet he still allows that\u2026 Good grief\u2026He did not arbitrarily tell a disciple from Gathering Clouds Peak to pass the news, but instead asked two disciples from the two peaks to go together. From the outside, this seemed like a matter of respect. Moreover, this gave Second Brother more face. But in fact, he was rekindling latent conflict amongst disciples.What is Eldest Martial Brother deliberately doing? Or is this a tactic aimed at Second Martial Brother\u2019s Locking Clouds Peak?Kong Jing Feng stared at the back of Wu Yun Liang as his mind wandered. This obviously cannot be asked directly\u2026I only hope that this plan will work! Kong Jing Feng thought to himself.Suddenly a series of noises rose up, a shadow almost without presence fly into the room through the window. It was a small bird; its whole body completely pale white. It quickly landed on the table, tilted its head and looked at the two.Colorless Falcon!The two people\u2019s eyes lit up. Kong Jing Feng looked at the little falcon, laughingly he asked, \u201cEldest Martial Brother, this is not from Tie Yun\u2026?\u201dWu Yun Liang nodded, with calm eyes, he took a small bamboo tube from the Colorless Falcon; from it, he took out a piece of paper.After looking at the content of the paper, his countenance became quite serious. Before long, his eyebrows rose. Apparently, he had come to a major decision.*******************************************************************************************Chu Yang was unaware of this affair, nor did he know that the sect had fallen into danger. He was currently absorbed in his cultivation.In fact, he only knew that the sect would be destroyed in four years time. But as for the reason, he was not clear. In his previous life, he was only a minor disciple without any friends during this period. Moreover with his eccentric personality, he did not bother going anywhere.In three months, the Ranking Competition within the sect will begin. This competition will last about half a year. 800 disciples will be screened gradually until only ten remained. Then the ten will be sent away for three years of vigorous training. On the fourth year, the sect will choose one outstanding candidate amongst them to be Eldest Martial Brother. (TLN: Eldest of the whole sect. So more like the top disciple who will probably take over as Sect Master in the future.)However, Chu Yang could not wait that long. He wanted to establish his position within half a year. Then, he would be allowed to enter the Seven Shades Congregation Grounds to get the first fragment of the Nine Tribulations Sword.To do this, he will have try twice as hard! Even though he was now borne again, he was without any support. He will have to rely on his own efforts. With his cultivation as a Martial Pupil of the Fourth Grade, even with his full experience, he would be useless against the top disciples of the sect because they were above him by tens of levels.Force is only effective in certain cases, just as ploy has its own limits. A group of kids can trap a rabbit, but cannot kill a tiger.Currently, Chu Yang was training frantically.Another day and night passed, Li Jian Yin has not made any moves. According to Tan Tan, after he returned Li Jian Yin, Second Elder Martial Uncle, Li Jinsong, was so angry his face turned purple. He angrily screamed and yelled\u2026However, Chu Yang never felt any pressure from the incident.Even if the sky falls down, there was a mountain to hold it up. Shi Qian Shan was that mountain! (TLN: Shan means mountain)Just let him fend for me!In the glimmering Purple Bamboo Forest, Chu Yang\u2019s form was strong like a mountain, two legs anchored firmly on a pile of sharp stones. His whole body remained motionless, maintaining balance.\u201cSwoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!\u201d He kept repeating the same action, drawing his sword and sheathing it\u2026 drawing it and sheathing it\u2026Only a simple action, but he had practiced since dawn until now. Below his body, sweat had dripped down to form a puddle.Chu Yang took half a step forward with his left foot. His toes slightly tilted outward while his right foot stayed in place. His eyes looked calmly ahead. His hands on the hilt of the sword. A very small noise sound. He lifted his hand, twisting his waist and focused all of his attention toward the front. One could only see the light of the sword appear in a flash as it went forward. His gaze was extremely calm. His arm was bent down, obviously with more power to spare.\u201cShiiiiiinng!\u201dThen rays of light flashed, the sword returned to its sheath.Chu Yang\u2019s gaze remained unchanged. Looking at his face and his eyes, no one could tell if he was satisfied with this move. Chu Yang continued to repeat the motion!Exactly the same movements, boring and tasteless. A normal person would only try a dozen times and be bored, while Chu Yang had repeated this action a thousand times since before sunrise.On his body, a new wave of sweat began to pour. Just in the morning alone, his arms had already become sore and then numb, then regained feeling, then became numb again\u2026Regardless of normal pain or deathly pain or if the body had reached its limits, he had full control over his body. He still pulled the sword in a very precise manner.The sword was just a normal metal sword. It\u2019s black sheath even more so!The quiet night of Purple Bamboo Forest was disturbed by that normal sword. Its aura raged!The sound of the drawn sword seemed to have become softer and softer. In the beginning, it clanged. Now, it only made a very soft 'swish,\u201d so soft that one could hardly hear.Chu Yang still did not rest.What he didn\u2019t know was that a little while after he started training, a few meters from him, there was a tall shadow quietly watching. Every morning that Chu Yang trained, that shadow would watch him. The morning mist had made his whole body drenched, but he seemed to not want to disturb Chu Yang. He just stood there quietly.Finally, with sun rays shining from the east, Chu Yang slowly sheathed his sword and took a long breath. He stood there quietly. The killing aura in the air also slowly disappeared.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euClosing his eyes, he collected his sword intent and killing intent back inside himself!To train the Sword Arts, there must be killing intent! It was necessary for fostering a sharp sword aura. This point was not a difficulty for Chu Yang, because he only had to think about Shi Qian Shan and Mo Tian Ji then his sword aura would lose control and become filled with killing aura. This did not need to be improved.When he opened his eyes, there was another person before him.\u201cMaster?\u201d said Chu Yang with a light exhale.This person was, of course, Meng Chao Ran, who was supposed to be in closed door training.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 17 \u2013 Sword training is for killing\u201cYou have been training for hours, but your body never moved from that spot.\u201d Meng Chao Ran looked deeply into the eyes of his second disciple. With much contemplation, he said, \u201cIt seems you have been training your sword non-stop?\u201d\u201cHonorable Master!\u201d Chu Yang smiled. To him, this master, regardless if it was the previous life or this life, he will always be respectful.Even though Meng Chao Ran was stoic in nature, no one dared to look down on him. He might seem to be unattached, never taking anything to heart, but nothing seems to escape him. Moreover, internally, he always knows to weigh the importance of things.Weighing the world!Such people, no matter where they were, they are always outstanding characters!In his heart, there was something he wanted to protect; that was the sect! Beyond the Heavens Sect! Because of this, at the time when the Beyond the Heavens Sect was attacked, he had rather fight to the death than retreat! In the wind tainted with the smell of the rain of blood, he always tried to protect his disciples.Or perhaps the master had some other regrets. Only, Chu Yang did not know what it was. He only knew that, late at night, his teacher often silently stood alone in the wind looking nostalgic. As if thinking about something\u2026\u201cYou are training the heart, the intent, and the sword speed. Yet you also want to control the sound as the sword is leaving the sheath!\u201d With arms folded in front of his chest, Meng Chao Ran, asked casually, \u201cWho taught you these things?\u201d\u201cNo one taught me, I just suddenly realized, when you pull your sword, intention should be used with each strike to have effectiveness.\u201d Chu Yang continued, \u201cBefore, disciple only knew to practice the sword and practice some more\u2026 Truly, I have fallen very far behind\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 that is correct.\u201d Meng Chao Ran nodded gently, then he immediately raised his hand. Chu Yang felt his hand become heavier. It turned out there was a container of water in his hand. (TLN: is it plastic??!)\u201cAfter you finish sword training, you immediately took in your sword intent and dispersed the killing aura internally. After that, you talked to me. Your performance today indicated a stable foundation, you can now be molded.\u201d Meng Chao Ran smiled.After physical activity, one absolutely should not drink. If Chu Yang drank right after his sword practice, then all the results of his training since early this morning would become nothing. Moreover, it can also hard the body.But now, he did not need that period of rest anymore.Chu Yang held up the container and took a few sips, then put it down. He was extremely thirsty. But now was not a good time to drink too much water. Everyone knows this principle, but few can restrain from the burning pain of thirst.Meng Chao Ran continued to look at him. He gently exhaled, smiled and said, \u201cOnly in using the heart to practice does one achieve sword heart. Once sword heart is achieved, you can train in sword courage. Only when you have sword courage, then you can move about under the heavens unhindered. Amongst disciples your age, everyone knows this principle, but those who are able to practice this are not many. Today you have forced yourself to achieve this state. Not bad. But you still need to continue to try harder.\u201d (TLN: dudes, I don\u2019t even know\u2026 what is sword heart? What is sword courage? Just assume it\u2019s something epic and hope it doesn\u2019t show up again.)He paused for a moment and continued to say, \u201cI will not oversee how you train, however, why are you trying to exercise control over the sound of the sword unsheathing?\u201dChu Yang laughed. \u201cMaster, all swordsmen of the Nine Heavens are like that as well. All sabre practitioners as well. Their weapons are made of steel. For wealthy people the sheaths are made of gold, silver, or some legendary metal. Even more precious materials are also used. Overall, they are metallic. Metal is tough and is not prone to abrasion, thus these weapons can be used for a long time. Moreover, they would contribute to the attack strength. These are all advantages. But when the weapon is pulled from a sheath, the friction will create a sound.\u201d\u201cCorrect.\u201d Meng Chao Ran nodded his head.\u201cHowever, this sound will give your opponents time to be on guard. Disciple believes that this is the shortcoming of metal sheaths!\u201d Chu Yang slowly continued. \u201cMaster, what do you think sword training is for? It is for killing people! If it were merely for exercise, then there would be no need to use weapons. If we already wanted to kill people, why should we give them time to prepare? One strike, one kill, isn\u2019t that more decisive? I am training to draw my sword without a sound, to create an element of surprise!\u201d\u201cJiang Hu is without mercy, a man must kill, fresh blood for miles. Killing people from the shadows. I faithfully believe that killing without sound, without warning, is the supreme realm of Sword Arts.\u201d\u201cKilling without sound, without warning? Like the way you dealt with Shi Qian Shan?\u201d Meng Chao Ran slightly tilted his head. His gaze became sharp.Chu Yang was momentarily startled. He could not believe that Meng Chao Ran noticed this. Moreover, he saw through everything that Chu Yang had arranged. \u201cIt cannot be left unsaid, entrapping Shi Qian Shan was refreshing.\u201dChu Yang calmly smiled without any denial. Then he suddenly said in a quiet voice, \u201cIf he was not stupefied by beauty, with a desire for conquest, he would not have fallen into such a trap.\u201dMeng Chao Ran gave Chu Yang a profound look, then let out a long sigh and immediately changed the topic. He clasped his hands, turned and walked away, while calmly saying, \u201cYou just said that learning the sword is for killing\u2026 don\u2019t you feel this is a little one-sided? You need to remember that in this world, there are many things worth valuing, there are also many things you must be concerned with. Learning the sword is not only for killing, but also for protecting those things we hold dear.\u201dWith a long sigh, Meng Chao Ran continued, \u201cHuman life is precious. If you can spare, then spare. Even with those who are extremely evil and cruel, each time you kill a person, you injure your own heart. No matter who you kill, it is still a monstrous crime. They are born from parents, they are fathers, brothers, or husbands to someone.\u201d (TLN: well, what about if you kill a girl?)\u201cWhat master said holds true, disciple agrees. However, when others come to destroy what we protect\u2026because we don\u2019t want to make our side suffer in tears\u2026\u201d Chu Yang followed behind Meng Chao Ran walking straight ahead. He spoke firmly, \u201cSo I have to make the enemies\u2019 parents suffer in tears. People like that cannot be spared!\u201dMeng Chao Ran said, \u201cIf it is possible to spare, then spare.\u201d\u201cEven if I spare, others will not spare me,\u201d Chu Yang said. \u201cThis world is as such. Dangers and enemies must be destroyed.\u201d\u201cYour killing aura is too heavy! It is not good at all!\u201d Meng Chao Ran sighed.With pity, he shook his head. \u201cIf revenge breeds revenge, will there ever be an end?\u201d (TLN: famous Buddhist saying)\u201cWhen killing weeds, you must eradicate the root. Then you will not leave catastrophe for later! Master, your heart has become soft and weak. You are not like people in Jiang Hu anymore.\u201d Chu Yang said bluntly.\u201cYou practice the sword as to not make a sound, that\u2019s the same as a sneak attack. This goes against the traditional rules of Jiang Hu. I fear people will criticize you and that this will lead to negative effects on your legacy.\u201dChu Yang laughed and said, \u201cTraditional rules are traditional rules. I am who I am. Why do I have to follow those traditional rules? Disciple works with just one single rule; that is to protect my life! Not being able to protect your life, then complying with those rules is meaningless.\u201dHe paused a moment, then said with a sarcastic tone, \u201cMoreover, currently in Jiang Hu, there aren\u2019t many who follow those old rules. Those old rules have caused so many honest people to go to their deaths.\u201dMeng Chao Ran became silent!Teacher and student were unable to persuade each other. But inside, each of them felt a strange sensation. In the previous life, Chu Yang treated his master with utmost reverence, never arguing with him about anything. Currently, the two walked, one after the other, while having this verbal exchange. Even though all this talk about killing spoiled the ideal surrounding, but inside, Chu Yang felt an immense warmth.Meng Chao Ran as well!Even though he did not agree with Chu Yang\u2019s words, but he cannot deny the rationale behind Chu Yang\u2019s philosophy. The reason he did not say anymore was because, even with his students, he never forced anyone to follow his ideals. Everyone had their own path, how they walked those paths was their choice.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMaster, there is something disciple cannot understand.\u201d Chu Yang contemplated.\u201cYou want to ask about Shi Qian Shan?\u201d Meng Chao Ran let out a loud laugh. \u201cI have condoned Shi Qian Shan\u2019s deceit against you two. Letting him monopolize resources of the sect without a care, is that right?\u201dChu Yang raised his eyes and his sword-like eyebrows came together. This had made him suspicious for a very long time. If Meng Chao Ran already knew, then why did he not bother to stop it? Shi Qian Shan was his disciple, perhaps he and Tan Tan were not?Before, Chu Yang could not express his dissatisfaction because he knew Meng Chao Ran had reasons for his actions. Now he was asking because he wanted to know; because his next step was to kill Shi Qian Shan!What if his action ended up destroying Meng Chao Ran\u2019s plans?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You two were dumb; even if I had explained, it would have been useless.\u201d Meng Chao Ran casually continued. \u201cUnderhanded falsehood, the mouth speaks of the words of Buddha while the mind thinks like a snake. Although low and despicable, it is also a skill. Moreover, it is a necessary condition for success while walking the Jiang Hu. Shi Qian Shan has not been discreet enough since he was discovered by you.\u201dAfter a short pause, Meng Chao Ran said, \u201cShi Qian Shan still does not lie well enough.\u201dChu Yang quietly walked behind him for a moment, then said with a low voice, \u201cI understand.\u201dWalking slowly without turning back, Meng Chao Ran continued speaking with his emotionless voice, \u201cIf you did not find out, I would still condone Shi Qian Shan\u2019s actions until he no longer needs me. Even though there are only the three of you, this is still Jiang Hu! To live or to die, is your business. You make the choice!\u201d (TLN: um, teacher, why so mean T_T)As he said the words \u201cto live or to die, is your business,\u201d his face still did not changed. Only, his voice became heavy with a burdened heart.The words sounded heartless, but it made Chu Yang sigh deeply. The master was only there to show them the way; ultimately the road ahead is up to them.At this time, Meng Chao Ran might seem uncaring, but the truth was he truly wanted his disciples to experience Jiang Hu, even if it was a little late. However, compared to disciples of other places, his disciples would still be one be one step ahead.Being able to experience it for themselves was totally different from being taught. Even though this was a little cruel, they would have to go through it sooner or later. A little sooner and it would give them that much more control over their own lives!This understanding of the master\u2019s concern came from Chu Yang\u2019s previous life, after the sect was destroyed.\u201cIf you two continue to be stupid after leaving the sect, it would be just a matter of time before you die from the hands of others. And if that were to be, why would I place any expectations on you? Do not think that I am heartless, it is just that the Beyond the Heavens Sect needs heroes not idiots.\u201d\u201cShi Qian Shan is devious and cruel. He is not a good person.\u201dWhen Meng Chao Ran stopped, Chu Yang discovered that they had arrived at the cliff face behind the mountain. Then Meng Chao Ran said, \u201cBut Shi Qian Shan gets the job done. His capabilities are good, that is why I let him be. I used him to control you two. Before, you two seemed very ordinary. Your concerns were trivial and na\u00efve. The smaller the achievement, the greater the chance of survival. Even when people looked down on you, you at least have a chance to live. I only want my disciples to be able to live. As to what path you choose, I won\u2019t control it. Everything is determined by the heavens. If you did not suddenly discover his plots, I would not have said anything to you. Perhaps, I may be a qualified teacher or not yet worthy, but since Shi Qian Shan started to deceive you, you had not realized. On the contrary, you were grateful to him. In not telling you, I have made the choice for you.\u201d (TLN: so um, he basically thought they were too dumb to handle Shi Qian Shan.)He turned around and looked deep into Chu Yang\u2019s eyes. \u201cUntil that day, the day that you started asking me questions.\u201d\u201cI understand!\u201dEven though Meng Chao Ran\u2019s words were cold and indifferent, but Chu Yang was extremely grateful. If he and Tan Tan foolishly exposed Shi Qian Shan, then their lives would have been much more difficult.\u201cThese past few days, even though I announced I would be closed door training, I was secretly watching all of you.\u201d Meng Chao Ran laughed loudly. \u201cIt was at this time that I discovered that I, Meng Chao Ran, have once again made an erroneous judgment. You, Chu Yang, you truly gave me a surprise. I have change my initial assessment of you!\u201dChu Yang felt very ashamed. Not only did I deceive my master, but in my previous life, I was so na\u00efve\u2026There is one thing I do not understand; my master said \u2018have once again made an erroneous judgment,\u2019 these words seem to hide a deeper meaning. Maybe he had made a similar mistake once before?\u201cAt the most, only your personality needs to change,\u201d Meng Chao Ran thought for a moment and said gravely, \u201cFor people in Jiang Hu, bloodshed is inevitable. But during our talk today, you carried a very heavy killing aura. You now know to work hard. I fear that your achievements in the days to come will surpass my own. The reason I worry\u2026 If someone found the parents who abandoned you\u2026 that is why I am having this talk with you today.\u201d (TLN: I think he means that Chu Yang\u2019s parents might be a weak point for him later if he becomes someone great)\u201cHa, ha!\u201d Chu Yang smiled coldly. His eyes revealed an intense hatred. As a person of two worlds, this is the thing that haunts him the most. Chu Yang was an orphan, a child who was abandoned! When Meng Chao Ran found him, he was a baby still wrapped in diapers amidst a harsh winter. He left in front of a deserted temple. After Chu Yang found out about this, his heart was filled with a bitterness that could not be suppressed.You gave birth to me, why did you throw me away? Even if you bring me into a poor family, you could have helped me to continue to live. But you left me in front a deserted temple on a cold winter night!Even in a deserted temple, it would still be better than outside, right? At least I could have extended a few more breaths. They obviously wanted me dead, but did not have the heart to kill a newborn baby. So they chose to deceive themselves like this. A child not yet a year old\u2026 If a generous person did not come along, wouldn\u2019t death be the only possibility? How could there be such cruel parents under the heavens?Looking at hatred on Chu Yang\u2019s face, Meng Chao Ran sighed, \u201cMaster will give you three pieces of advice. You must keep them in your heart. First, without your parents, you were still able to live. Second, under the heavens, there are no parents who do not love their children! Third, in the natural laws of heavens, your life is given to you by your parents.\u201d\u201cMaster is right,\u201d Chu Yang said calmly.Meng Chao Ran sighed inwardly, he knew Chu Yang said one thing, but obviously thought another. He worried that Chu Yang could not untie the knots in his heart. It is easy to distinguish because he said \u2018Master is right\u2019 as opposed to \u2018Disciple will remember.\u2019It is difficult to blame Chu Yang for his hatred. Amongst the 800 disciples of the Beyond the Heavens Sect, the amount of orphans were numerous. But it was because their parents all passed away. As to those who were actually abandoned by their parents, there were only two: Chu Yang and Tan Tan.The feeling of being discarded, moreover by his own biological parents, is indescribably painful. Over time, that pain grew larger and became engraved in his heart. Finally, it became a bitter hatred.Furthermore Chu Yang was a very proud person!Chu Yang\u2019s eccentric personality appeared after he came to understand the ways of life. Since he knew of his origin, he always remained stoic and never said much; slowly he became the way he was now.The hatred had accumulated in his heart for 16 years.Meng Chao Ran sighed looking mournfully at his disciple. On Chu Yang\u2019s calm countenance, Meng Chao Ran could feel a vast and intense fury mixed with grief. He only feared that once that fury starts to burn, Chu Yang himself will be burned to ashes as well. (TLN: Teacher is so full of it, let MC hate!)Meng Chao Ran only knew the Chu Yang\u2019s fury had been accumulating for 16 years. However he didn\u2019t know that this fury wasn\u2019t simply from the 16 years, but instead has been accumulated in two lifetimes\u2026\u201cAll the teachings of the sect, you are already know. Sword Arts, martial arts, sabre arts, you understood. With the exception of some principle teachings of the Beyond the Heavens Sect, you have learned everything.\u201dMeng Chao Ran lowered his voice and said, \u201cIn the future, you will have to take responsibility for yourself. The remaining principle teachings of the sect can only be taught to the ten top disciples. Everything\u2026 depends on you.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Chu Yang nodded.The spot the two were standing was on a mountain top. At this moment a beam of light radiated from the east. The sun suddenly appeared out of the horizon.Meng Chao Ran squinted his eyes, gazing eastward. His eyes looked as if they had been dyed with the countless colors of the spectrum, emitting an indescribable brightness that slowly condensed into a dazzling light.The sky was brilliantly colored.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euChu Yang suddenly felt that Master Meng Chao Ran\u2019s silhouette was very forlorn and alone!The sun was beginning to show itself, the beams of light were penetrating through the clouds and shone upon Meng Chao Ran, creating a very long shadow in the middle of the mountain.After a very long time, Meng Chao Ran said with a deep voice, \u201cChu Yang, you were the first child I found. When I held you, during the stormy winter night, I immediately realized that there would be a tragedy for mankind. At that time, I thought\u2026 I should throw you away! I did not want to be involved with this disaster for mankind\u2026\u201dChu Yang could not keep himself from shaking. He sharply lifted his head, looking at his master\u2019s back. His mouth moved, but he could not say a word.\u201cBut there was something that made me change my mind.\u201d With his back towards Chu Yang, Meng Chao Ran stretched out his arm, his fist gradually loosening to reveal a small jade pendant the size of a finger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 19 \u2013Pure Purple Jade EssenceThis jade pendant was completely purple, like the purple of the horizon at sunrise! It made people feel as if the peculiar purple color was otherworldly.At the moment the jade was revealed on Meng Chao Ran\u2019s hand, it was exposed to the sunlight and emitted a thousand rays of incredible brilliance, as if all the purples in heaven and earth were gathered there!This was, indeed, a very valuable piece of jade!With just one glance, Chu Yang had come to that conclusion. In his previous life, he had traveled everywhere under the heavens and have seen many extraordinary treasures. He had also seen countless jade masterpieces. But there were few that were comparable to that small jade pendant.Meng Chao Ran whispered, \u201cThis piece of gemstone is pure purple jade essence. Even though it is somewhat small, it is an extremely pure piece of jade essence. This type of pure purple jade essence is hard to find even in a thousand years. You have to have a thousand pieces of the best jade to compare to the value of this one! It takes the pure purple jade over a thousand years to form a piece of jade essence!\u201dMeng Chao Ran turned around. \u201cThis piece of pure purple jade essence is priceless! When I found you, this gem was worn on a cord around your neck.\u201dHis gaze was like electric current driving into Chu Yang\u2019s face, making Chu Yang feel like his face was burning.Chu Yang\u2019s throat twitched. It suddenly felt dry. He put out his hands and received this priceless piece of pure purple jade essence. His strong arms suddenly became shaky. This piece of gemstone is the only link to my true identity.\u201cIn the middle of the gemstone, there is the word Chu,\u201d Meng Chao Ran said unhurriedly, \u201cThe surface of the jade essence is without a single blemish. On the inside, there appeared such a word. The level of cultivation needed to achieve this, even if Master chased after on a horse, I would not be able to reach it! The word Chu is either your first name or your last name.\u201d\u201cWhen I carried you away and climbed up the mountain, the color of the sky suddenly became clear, just as the night was over and the sun slowly appeared\u2026\u201dHe paused a moment, then continued, \u201cJust like right now. The sun had just come up. Like the sincere emotion of my entire life. I immediately named you Chu Yang.\u201d (TLN: Yang means sun, also Meng Chao Ran waxes lyrically way too much)There was slight bitterness in his voice. The tone remained calm, but it seemed as if an old emotion suddenly was brought to mind.\u201cI hope that you will not let the name Chu Yang down. As well as not letting down this piece of pure purple jade essence.\u201dMeng Chao Ran took a deep breath. His emotions once again settled.\u201cYour background surely cannot be ordinary. If you had continued to be ordinary like before, then I wouldn\u2019t have given you the jade! But strangely enough, I had hoped that you would continue to be ordinary like that for the rest of your life.\u201dMeng Chao Ran whispered, \u201cI had hoped that you would be able to go through your days in peace.\u201dHe did not turn his head, but his eyes were filled with emotions. Like a suffering father who can only hope that his son will live a peaceful life and not dare have some distant dreams of great wealth and privilege.Great wealth and power often have proportional dangers. No parents want their children to endure any sorts of danger.Chu Yang quietly listened and did not interrupt. But in his heart a storm was emerging.Hearing Meng Chao Ran\u2019s words, Chu Yang cannot cease to wonder. At first, it seemed to be just a little narrative about Chu Yang\u2019s life alone, but he can hear from those words that there were some hidden information.From a piece of valuable purple jade, rare in this world. The writing was carved inside but the surface is undamaged. Pure purple jade is inherently difficult to damage by swords as well as force of internal energy\u2026 This is pure purple jade essence, it is obviously a lot harder.Even a Revered Martial Artist would have difficulty engraving it, let alone the fact the surface was undamaged and the engraving is inside.Perhaps it was carved by someone with King or Majesty level? Or even higher cultivation than that?Such a precious item was too rare in this world to be found around a baby\u2019s neck. And why was that baby thrown away? What secrets were hidden behind this story?My identity is shrouded in an endless rolling fog\u2026 If I want to melt away this fog, I would have to put in just as much effort. Since this was carved by someone sixteen years ago, his cultivation level must be Majesty or higher\u2026Chu Yang bit his lips; his gaze became calm. It is possible that I was not discarded. There must be some reason behind all of this.This line of thought was like warm sun rays that warmed the frost in his heart, making his mind peaceful once again.He slowly clenched his hand, securing the Pure Purple Jade Essence inside his fist.The jade essence was smooth and cold, but under the force of Chu Yang hand something strange happened. The energy inside his body began to automatically flow. When coming into contact with the jade essence a strange warmth emanated from the palm of his hand and entered the meridians, making Chu Yang\u2019s entire body warm\u2026 All the exhaustion from the days of cultivation suddenly dissipated!Chu Yang was overcome. He abruptly looked at Meng Chao Ran.\u201cYour feeling is correct.\u201d Meng Chao Ran smiled, \u201cThis piece of pure purple jade essence can help restore martial power with the fastest speed. It may have other properties as well. You must guard it carefully! However, you should not depend on it too much.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dChu Yang\u2019s eyes were filled with appreciation. With a treasure like this on hand, one can indeed cultivate day and night. Martial power will obviously advance very quickly. Regardless of whose hand the gemstone falls into, that person would probably keep it for their own.If Meng Chao Ran did not reveal this, Chu Yang would have gone through his entire life without ever knowing. Even if it was placed in front of him, he would not know that this was the link to his identity.But Meng Chao Ran had quietly guarded it for sixteen years to return it to its owner today.Meng Chao Ran\u2019s sentiment was rare in this world.For Chu Yang, this gesture of Meng Chao Ran was many times more precious than the Pure Purple Essence Jade!When Meng Chao Ran said not to be too reliant on the gemstone, Chu Yang also understood. Without the feeling of exhaustion, the body will not be able to get to its extreme limit. For a martial artist, only in being able to feel the extreme limit can one break beyond the current level.Meng Chao Ran said slowly, \u201cBased on this jade pendant, I can say that if you are not from a family of great wealth then at the least a powerful one! Before your power is fully developed, you should not be concerned about this. It might bring disaster upon you! If such an unfortunate thing were to happen, I fear all of Beyond the Heavens Sect will not be able to save your life! You must remember that!\u201d\u201cYes, I will keep your words in mind.\u201dChu Yang earnestly agreed. Ever since he saw this pure purple jade essence, he already had the same thought.\u201cOne of master\u2019s biggest wishes in life is to bring glory to Beyond the Heavens Sect! And protect Beyond the Heavens Sect!\u201d Meng Chao Ran said solemnly, \u201cYou already have an aspiration to become powerful, so please help me protect Beyond the Heavens Sect and take care of it well!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Chu Yang responded to this request with a nod. Others might not know, but Chu Yang was quite clear on the impending tragedy that would fall upon Beyond the Heavens Sect in four years. Today, in accepting, he has shouldered this burden.Currently, with his poor cultivation, it would be almost impossible to take on this responsibility even if he tried a hundred thousand times more than others.Anyway, I now have my first goal in life!It is Beyond the Heavens Sect!Once Beyond the Heavens Sect is freed from this tragedy, I will traverse under the heavens looking for the Nine Tribulations Sword and Mo Qing Wu while also trying to shed light on my identity.Chu Yang\u2019s goals after his rebirth were fairly simple: Mo Qing Wu and Nine Tribulations Sword. Finding Mo Qing Wu, he would live the rest of his life loving her. Find Nine Tribulations Sword, he would advance to the peak. (TLN: This literally means mountain peak, he probably meant peak of cultivation.)Ambiguous background. In his previous life, he did not know the story of the pure purple jade essence nor did he hope to discover his true identity\u2026 He had had little affection for the sect. However, they had all now come together at once.\u201cWhy did master say these words to me today?\u201d Chu Yang mused for a moment then continued, \u201cYou have never mentioned any of this before.\u201dMeng Chao Ran smiled, looked at the far horizon where there were red clouds as if painted with fresh blood, and calmly said, \u201cBeyond the Heavens Sect has many disciples, but they cultivate for the sake of practice. Just that only.\u201dHe stopped talking for a long time, then slowly said, \u201cThe way you practiced today, it is for walking the jiang hu.\u201dChu Yang remained silent, saying nothing.Meng Chao Ran directed his gaze in the the direction of the rising sun and sighed. This was a very long sigh as if it had been repressed inside him for decades.He looked at the sun. There was a mysterious appearance on his face as if remembering with a feeling of pain and loss\u2026 In short, his countenance was complex like he was immersed in a dream that he could not escape from.Chu Yang remained quiet for a while, and then eventually asked in a low voice:\u201cMaster just said that protecting Beyond the Heavens Sect is only one of your greatest wishes. But what are your other wishes? If it so happens that I can help, I will of course join in your effort to fulfill them.\u201dUpon hearing his question, Meng Chao Ran\u2019s body began to tremble as if suffering from an electric shock. His face suddenly paled like an long-buried, painful memory was rekindled. He stood bewildered. His eyes filled with misery and shock, but he remained quiet as if he had turned into stone.A long time after, as if still in a dream, he bowed and said:\u201cWind and rain cannot wipe the scars in our hearts, misery cannot destroy love; since ancient times, nobody took this lightly, with separation do we know emptiness and desolation\u2026\u201d (TLN: Who\u2019s betting it\u2019s another love issue?)Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHis voice was very low like whispers and sorrowful moans in a dream. His was a kind of pent-up feeling that was about to explode. However, he can only groan in despair and endless loneliness.When they reached his ears, Chu Yang felt that his master has placed his broken heart and misfortunes into those short words\u2026This feeling made Chu Yang suddenly remembered his previous life at the battle of Wind and Thunder Platform. In a moment of hopelessness with no way out, he thought of Mo Qing Wu with sorrow and a broken heart.Meng Chao Ran\u2019s current situation was not different from his back then. It was as if the heart was almost dead. Did master experience the regret of a lifetime?Maybe it was this that made master change. Not paying attention to anything. Not caring about anything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Before leaving, he did not speak even a single word to Chu Yang.There seemed to still be a heavy air. After some time, it still did not dissipate.Chu Yang was stunned for a long time. He vaguely felt that Meng Chao Ran was suffering some kind of unimaginable miserable, bitter situation. Whatever happened that made a heaven-sent genius of the Beyond the Heavens Sect to become like this?****************************************************************************************************This knot in his master\u2019s heart; if he had the chance, he would definitely help his master get rid of it.Chu Yang took one breath in, his gaze narrowed. He swung his sword; sword qi filled the air!During this sword training, from beginning to end, he vigorously practiced. After finishing with drawing the sword and putting it back into the sheath, he practiced connecting the different moves. Each move and each method seemed easy-going, but were not.Regardless of whether it was protecting the Beyond the Heavens Sect, finding Mo Qing Wu or fulfilling his master\u2019s aspirations, it would all require power.Without power, one would have to depend on others to fulfill their own desires.Chu Yang casually wore the pure purple jade essence pendant. As long as his qi did not activate it, it was not much different from other gemstones.Chu Yang intended that until the completion of the first phase of cultivation, he would not use the recovering ability of the pendant. According to Meng Chao Ran\u2019s words, if he relied too much on external things, then not only would there be no benefits, but there could also be bad consequences.The only way was to pour drop by drop of sweat; slowly working hard to have a solid foundation. Only then can you have a deep understanding! If you keep depending on external forces, then even if your martial strength were to advance quickly, your cultivation state will never reach its peak. This will become a deficiency that you cannot make up in your entire life.A Martial Great Master has the mental state of a Martial Great Master. Then, he has to stop there and make sure to understand all the principles before advancing into Revered Martial Artist.If a Martial Warrior got lucky and suddenly obtained a thousand years of martial strength but without the understanding to go with it, then he cannot become a Supreme Martial Artist. He would still be a Martial Warrior!At most, he would be an abnormal Martial Warrior.So every step has to be firm!Being taught the path from another person is different from climbing to the top by yourself. Getting thrown by others, you would surely fall and end up dead!Time went by quickly, at lunch, Chu Yang came face to face with Shi Qian Shan. Shi Qian Shan\u2019s countenance was overcast with not even a little spirit. He was melancholy and listless.Everyone knew that Li Jian Yin\u2019s incident would definitely not be ignored. Second Elder Martial Uncle\u2019s disciples would want to take revenge for Li Jian Yin, even if it was just to kiss up to their master.Currently, they had not come because they were still plotting. This was by no means over\u2026Tan Tan was innocently gnawing on chicken legs without a care. He ate to the point that his hands were covered in grease. Chu Yang was also very happy, he sat down and open his mouth wide to eat, as fast as the wind breaking the clouds. Only Shi Qian Shan had no interest; he forcefully put rice in his mouth, but it was as tasteless as water. After a few bites, he let out a long sigh.His dark gaze constantly glared at Chu Yang. The anger in his eyes seemed to be about to explode outward.\u201cShi Qian Shan! We heard you were very formidable? Even something about being the number one disciple? Ha ha! Come out here and enlighten us. Let\u2019s have a little competition.\u201d At this time there was a loud noise coming from outside, followed by a wave of laughter. Judging from the sound, there were about seven or eight people.\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Shi Qian Shan dared to call himself the number one disciple amongst the youth, he truly does not know how the word death is written!\u201d\u201cNumber one disciple? Is Shi Qian Shan worthy? Quickly come out and kneel and beg for mercy!\u201d****************************************************************************************************Finally, trouble finds it way. Even Chu Yang did not expect it to come so soon. Shi Qian Shan\u2019s color changed, his face became white. He gave Chu Yang a menacing look.\u2018Number one amongst all youth,\u2019 these were the words that Chu Yang acclaimed. At the time, Shi Qian Shan was very pleased with these words; but afterward, he finally understood that it was a mud pit he could not pull out from! Only, it was too late!Now those words were like a knife that cut through his heart.Mockery, truly brilliant mockery! (walkthejianghu.com)Furthermore, it was the most troublesome issue in the Beyond the Heavens Sect. Currently, there were none amongst the disciples of the eighth generation who did not want this number one title. This Eldest Martial Brother position! Having the right to enter the Seven Shades Congregation Ground\u2026Li Jian Yin\u2019s martial brothers did not dare to make trouble and avenge for Li Jian Yin outright, but the title \u2018number one disciple\u2019 that Chu Yang gave Shi Qian Shan was a very good excuse.The sect secretly supported disciples competing amongst each other. Shi Qian Shan could imagine that there would be a lot more trouble coming to his door.Chu Yang bent down and continued eating, as if he did not hear all the shouts of ridicule coming from outside. Nor the resentful gaze that Shi Qian Shan was giving him. He thought to himself. Ha, ha, in this life, if I cannot play this false hero to death, then it would be a waste of my rebirth\u2026The eight young people were all wearing blue/green clothing with red belts, their sleeves also had a red borders. This was the color of Locking Clouds Peak. As opposed to Purple Bamboo Garden that Chu Yang belonged to which used a purple belt. (TLN: Blue/green is a vague word that could be blue or green. Both in Chinese and Vietnamese, btw!)The eyes of the eight were filled with scorn as Shi Qian Shan walked out.Li Jian Yin was the only son of Li Jinsong. Being pampered every day had made him disagreeable with all his martial brothers. But even if they didn\u2019t get along with him, when he was being looked down upon by outsiders, they would take revenge even if it were not exactly for his sake.This was an excellent opportunity to kiss up!\u201cSo, Elder Martial Brothers Liu and Qu has come to visit. Please forgive Shi Qian Shan for not giving you a proper welcome.\u201d Even though Shi Qian Shan\u2019s expression was unsightly, he continued to speak ceremoniously.\u201cShi Qian Shan, this Liu dare not receive anything from you.\u201d Martial Brother Liu said harshly. \u201cNot to mention that you are \u2018number one amongst all youths\u2019 of the Beyond the Heavens Sect. With my cultivation, I would not dare be your elder martial brother.\u201dOf course, he borrowed \u2018number one amongst all youths\u2019!Shi Qian Shan countenance became increasingly ugly. His hatred for Chu Yang has reached its peak. He suddenly thought back. Perhaps, back then, Chu Yang said these words to leave an excuse for these guys to come here.This Liu Martial Brother was about thirty years old. His full name was Liu Yun Yan. He was the eldest disciple of Li Jinsong. Qu Martial Brother, his full name was Qu Ping. He was about 27-28 years old. He was the second eldest disciple. The rest were junior disciples. After hearing Liu Yun Yan, they all laughed loudly.\u201cShi Qian Shan, come, come, let me try out the skills of the number one disciple!\u201d Qu Ping took one step forward and pointed his sword in Shi Qian Shan\u2019s direction.\u201cHow can I be Qu Martial Brother\u2019s opponent?\u201d Shi Qian Shan urgently said with humility. These guys must be kidding, how would he dare make a move? The opponents were a total of eight people. And Liu Yun Yan had a higher martial ranking than him. As for Qu Ping and the other six, they were lower, but not by much. These opponents clearly wanted to cause trouble, how could Shi Qian Shan have any advantage. He only needed to make a move, then he would be beaten until his parents couldn\u2019t recognize him.As for Tan Tan and Chu Yang, their martial strengths were lacking, they were not of any use. It was only him against the eight people.Just because Shi Qian Shan didn\u2019t make a move, doesn\u2019t mean that Qu Ping would just stand around. Suddenly, there was a loud smack and a flash, followed by a \u2018pop\u2019 and a \u2018swoosh\u2019. Followed consistently one \u2018swoosh\u2019 after another.It turned out that, without saying anything, Qu Ping had smacked Shi Qian Shan in the face, followed by kicking in his stomach. Both the smack and the kicks were very strong. Shi Qian Shan did not have time to avoid them. In pain, he plopped to the ground.Shi Qian Shan knew that if he took care to not fight back, then he would only be hit a little and nothing big would happen. Fighting back would mean that he might not even survive. Facing the kicks of the enemy, he could only grit his teeth and bear the blows.\u201cThis rude guy dare to beat me!\u201d Qu Ping committed robbery and screamed for help at the same time. \u201cThis mother******, such pain! Truly he is worthy to be the Beyond the Heavens sect number one disciple! Brothers, he is really dangerous, quickly save me\u2026\u201d (TLN: Ahh, taking a page out of Chu Yang\u2019s book I see.)\u201cThis is bad. Second Elder Martial Brother is suffering. Charge!\u201dSix people shot off like bees. They beat Shi Qian Shan as if he were a sandbag, punching and kicking, like the rushing of the wind. With each hit, they called out, \u201cHow dare you beat Second Elder Martial Brother?!\u201d\u201cHe was having a fair discussion, Shi Qian Shan dared take a sneak attack.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s beat this shameless guy to death\u2026\u201dThere were also some who were beating Shi Qian Shan and screaming at the top of their lungs, \u201cShi Qian Shan, just because you are at Purple Bamboo Garden, doesn\u2019t mean you should be so arrogant. You\u2026 you\u2026 stop\u2026 Second Martial Brother, are you alright?\u201dIt all sounded like Qu Ping was being beaten to death.Qu Ping stood on the side, screaming out tragically, \u201cPain! I\u2019m dying\u2026 Shi Qian Shan, you are so cruel\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euInitially, Shi Qian Shan still groaned and begged for mercy, but gradually, with each hit, his body curled up and he went into shock\u2026The seven people were still angry, they continued beating him for a while before stopping. Everyone was panting. Qu Ping wiped his sweat off and said, \u201cThat was dangerous, this kid almost beat me to death\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right, this Shi Qian Shan is really devious.\u201d Said another.Tan Tan stared to the point that his eyes were red. He wanted to jump out, but Chu Yang stopped him. With so many opponents, Tan Tan would not have been able to do anything. He would only be beaten up like Shi Qian Shan\u2026 Moreover, Shi Qian Shan getting beaten up was a beautiful scene. How could he ruin that\u2026From a distance, in the shadows of the bamboo forest, Meng Chao Ran let out a long sigh. Quietly looking at a comatose Shi Qian Shan in the middle of the yard, his eyes were like ice and snow, freezing to the bone!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 21 \u2013 How about you let me help you?If Meng Chao Ran were Shi Qian Shan\u2019s master, then how could he have stood there and watched as this situation unfolded? However, he was currently filled with disappointment. Meng Chao Ran had always taught his disciples to have principles that they should solve their own problems. When they fail, he would come and aid them. Today, if Shi Qian Shan had at least some dignity to stand up and fight with his opponents, then Meng Chao Ran would have protected his disciple.Even if he had to fight straight into Locking Clouds Peak, Meng Chao Ran would do it! When your kids get beaten up, then they have someone to lean on. Would it not be the same with his disciples?Meng Chao Ran had already prepared everything carefully!However, he saw Shi Qian Shan\u2019s cowardice in not fighting back and taking a beating just to preserve his life. This was no different from not having any conviction nor any manliness. What can such behavior achieve if one day a powerful enemy attacked? Would you kneel and kowtow to him?Patience must also have its limits!I can fight for you, but you have to show that you are worthy of my efforts. I can cover for you once, but not your whole life. Everything depends on you.Such was the main principle taught by Meng Chao Ran. Though others might find it hard to understand, but this was a method to help his disciples survive in Jiang Hu.Enthusiasm and courage! Even though these two qualities were often seen as the impulsiveness of youth and also the cause of tragedy, however it was undeniable that without these two virtues, then you could not become powerful even with a thousand years of cultivation.Although enthusiasm and courage were considered defects, but in order to become powerful, you could not lack these two things.Meng Chao Ran felt extremely disappointed with Shi Qian Shan. He didn\u2019t want to intercede anymore\u2026In the Purple Bamboo Forest, standing a far distance from Meng Chao Ran were two people lost in their own thoughts. They were also watching the comedy that was unfolding in the yard. These two were Sect Master of the Beyond the Heavens Sect, Wu Yun Liang, and Master of Dream Clouds Peak, Kong Jing Feng. It was not known why these two have come; moreover, they were even excited to watch these youths fighting with each other.If Chu Yang were to see these two, he would surely be surprised.When they saw Shi Qian Shan lying curled up and unconscious on the ground, covered in dirt and blood, Qu Ping and Liu Yun Yan lost all interest and halted. They had previously thought that Shi Qian Shan who was so arrogant and dared to fight with Li Jian Yin would at least put up a fight.Much to their surprise, they encountered a sandbag who did not dare to move, letting others do as they pleased.They worried that hitting him too hard might lead to murder and immediately prepared to leave.Just as they were leaving, a voice spoke slowly, \u201cHey, are you guys just leaving like that?\u201dLiu Yun Yan and his group immediately stopped. (TLN: I wanted to say posse.)The other person continued, \u201cEight elder martial brothers got into a fight with Shi Qian Shan and suffered so much. It does not seem right that you leave like that.\u201dLiu Yun Yan turned around and stared coldly at the speaker and said, \u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201dThe seven others turned back as well, to see this surprising newcomer. When they were giving Shi Qian Shan a beating, that guy didn\u2019t say anything. Now that it was over, he showed his face.Perhaps he wants a beating as well!Chu Yang smiled peacefully and said, \u201cElder Martial Brother Qu have come to our Purple Bamboo Garden and suffered such a big grievance. Junior Martial Brother feels very guilty.\u201dHis face had always been cold. But now, he was smiling and talking so intimately, leaving Tan Tan\u2019s mouth gaping like he had just seen the devil.\u201cOh my god! I have known you for so long, today is the first time I have seen your smile. This life of mine has not been in vain!\u201d Tan Tan was filled with a thousand feelings.As for Liu Yun Yan\u2019s people, they were very annoyed. Just then, the eight men were beating Shi Qian Shan to the brink of death, while screaming that Shi Qian Shan was beating them.Chu Yang was a person from Purple Bamboo Garden, yet he was now following suit and also twisting the truth.Somehow this made the eight people even more upset.Chu Yang stood out not for Shi Qian Shan\u2019s sake, of course. If this happened elsewhere, he would have surely acted as if he had not seen a thing and leave. But this had happened at Purple Bamboo Garden, he could not let them leave comfortably like that!This was Master\u2019s sanctuary, it was also his master\u2019s face. (TLN: I bet you guys have never seen it used like that before.)The disciples of Locking Clouds Peak came to beat up Meng Chao Ran\u2019s disciple right at Purple Bamboo Garden and then calmly left; if such a thing were known, Meng Chao Ran\u2019s reputation would suffer a tremendous blow.Even though Meng Chao Ran never minded such things, Chu Yang could not help but care.From the previous life to now, Meng Chao Ran has always been the person Chu Yang respected the most.Shi Qian Shan\u2019s beating was exactly as he had planned, but those who dared to come to Purple Bamboo Garden to beat up people, they too should suffer the consequences!As he saw it, these were two different things.How should I kill with a borrowed knife? Chu Yang asked himself. Feeling a little dishonest, he unconsciously rubbed his nose. (TLN: Killing with a borrowed knife is a pretty common saying, here\u2019s more info.)Surely it is okay? Even though I\u2019m throwing stones with a hidden hand, these idiots are just a bunch of donkeys.Moreover, I can use Shi Qian Shan to shield from disaster. With the current situation, I must quickly gain the sword point fragment of the Nine Tribulations Sword, then I can truly trample them under my feet.If it was a matter of eventuality, then why not a little earlier?\u201cIn the end, what thoughts do you have?\u201d Liu Yun Yan signaled for his junior martial brothers to stop. Looking haughtily at Chu Yang, he thought, This kid is at best a Martial Artist at second or third grade. What tricks can he possibly have? No need to bother!\u201cWhat I meant was, this is Purple Bamboo Garden, not Locking Clouds Peak.\u201d Chu Yang smiled peacefully but his gaze was as sharp as a knife.\u201cSo what if it is Purple Bamboo Garden?\u201d Liu Yun Yan said.\u201cYou are from Locking Clouds Peak, even though we are from the same sect, but Locking Clouds Peak is Locking Clouds Peak and Purple Bamboo Garden is Purple Bamboo Garden.\u201d Chu Yang said blandly. \u201cYou guys dared to come to cause trouble in Purple Bamboo Garden, has any elder in the sect granted you permission?\u201d\u201cCause what trouble?\u201d Qu Ping glared. \u201cWe were only here to have a friendly competition with Junior Martial Brother Shi Qian Shan. Aren\u2019t such competitions common in the sect?\u201d\u201cRight, only a friendly competition!\u201d The rest yelled out. They absolutely could not have the words \u2018making trouble\u2019.\u201cOh? Friendly competition? The rules of the Beyond the Heavens Sect states that friendly competition amongst disciples must have an elder present. Can I ask where that elder is?\u201d Chu Yang smiled coldly and continued, \u201cBeyond the Heavens Sect rules state that friendly competition can be used to encourage disciples to prove themselves, but there must be an elder to watch over. So I ask you, where is the elder? Beyond the Heavens Sect also has a rule that friendly competitions need an agreement, so can I ask you where that agreement is?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Qu Ping was tongue-tied.When they came there, they already knew that Meng Chao Ran was at Purple Bamboo Garden. They figured they only had to ask him for permission for a friendly competition, then everything would pass smoothly.Moreover, it also would have brought great reputation to Locking Clouds Peak. \u201cYou guys think about this, we come in the name of friendly competition, but it is, in fact, to avenge junior martial brother. The place of our competition is Purple Bamboo Garden, so we can have Junior Martial Uncle Meng preside over the competition.\u201d Everything was open and upright conduct, the plan was perfect and without any flaws.If Li Jian Yin had come home injured and Locking Clouds Peak did not react, that would be a strange thing.However, they did not expect to come and find only three people. So they just said one or two sentences and immediately took action.Surprisingly, after the beating, someone was asking about the rules.Without an elder there, there was no way they could win this argument.\u201cGibberish! Today, it was Shi Qian Shan who provoked a fight and hit Elder Martial Brother Qu first. Elder Martial Brother Qu fought back in self-defense.\u201dOne of the youth\u2019s eyes open wide as he spoke brazenly.Chu Yang coldly looked at him and said, \u201cIf so, then Elder Martial Brother Qu\u2019s injuries must be serious, huh?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d The youth\u2019s face turned red, but he continued speaking firmly. \u201cLook, Elder Martial Brother has a wound on his rib and in the front on his chest, there\u2019s another wound. His whole body is covered with injuries!\u201d\u201cOh, then today was not a friendly competition then?\u201d Chu Yang delighted, tilted his head. \u201cWhy is your face so red? Did you do something against your conscience?\u201d\u201cOf course\u2026 of course, it was not a competition.\u201d Qu Ping persevered as he babbled on.The eight of them had just said in unison that it was a friendly competition. Now, under Chu Yang\u2019s sharp questioning, they immediately changed their tune and said it was not a competition.\u201cThen, when you get back, you will report that then?\u201d Chu Yang smiled and asked.\u201cOf course, we have to be honest. The sect has bestowed upon us favor greater than mountains, how could we tell a lie?\u201dWhen everyone heard Qu Ping say these words, they could not help but turn a little red themselves.\u201cBut this doesn\u2019t seem to fit too well. Elder Martial Brother Qu, look, if you have suffered such great injustice, but your body shows little injuries, would it not be hard to convince the elders?\u201d Chu Yang spoke sincerely. \u201cElder Martial Brother Qu, how about you let me help you? What do you think?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou, help me?\u201d Qu Ping eyes narrowed as he spoke. \u201cYou help me with what?\u201d\u201cI will help you create a few injuries on your body.\u201d Chu Yang said with an honest smile. \u201cElder Martial Brother Qu, I am only thinking of you! When you tell the elders about this incident, but they don\u2019t see any injuries, they will think that you are lying. According to the traditional rules, surely you will be punished. Would it not be better if I give you a few cuts, some light punches, plus some kicks? Do you think that\u2019s okay?\u201d\u201cHa, ha,\u201d Qu Ping laughed loudly and gave Chu Yang a condescending look. \u201cSo you are Chu Yang? Junior Martial Brother Li told us that we could deal with Shi Qian Shan, but we must save you for him to deal with. Ha, ha\u2026 that was why we did not touch you. Surprisingly, you want to help us? Ha, ha, with your lame skills, how would you help us?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s give it a try and see!\u201d Chu Yang said intimately. \u201cPerhaps Elder Martial Brother Qu will see that my words are true and will stand still and let me make a few wounds. Wouldn\u2019t that be very comfortable?\u201dQu Ping smiled and said casually, \u201cOur Beyond the Heavens Sect, in the nine peaks and one garden, there are a total of 796 disciples, males and females. We are ranked annually. I, Qu Ping, am untalented, but still ranked nineteen. May I ask what rank you are, Chu Yang?\u201d (TLN: the original Chinese said eight peaks, I can only assume author had a brain fart or typo. The sect was commonly referred to as nine peaks and one garden previously.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 22 \u2013 Fleeting Snow Cloud Movement TechniqueAfter Qu Ping raised his question, the youths behind roared with laughter. Everyone knew that the top ten positions of Beyond the Heavens Sect disciples were held by the Nine Peaks. The eldest disciple of Purple Bamboo Garden, Shi Qian Shan, only held position number 13. The two positions above him were also held by disciples from the Peaks.It seemed as if the ranking had been turned upside down. Chu Yang and Tan Tan, ordinary disciples, were now in confrontation with Qu Ping, one of the top twenty disciples. The difference in ranking between them were about 700 fold; this was indeed a case of a cat licking a tiger\u2019s nose\u2026 death wish!Chu Yang only laughed, a very ordinary laugh, but extremely cold. It was currently summer time, the weather was hot; but Chu Yang\u2019s laughter was like an icy wind, blown from the peaks of snowy mountains, making everybody chilled to the bone.Chu Yang\u2019s gaze became icy as he spoke slowly, \u201cPurple Bamboo Garden\u2019s honor is not for the likes of you to desecrate. Moreover, the traditional rules of Beyond the Heavens Sect are not for you to break. Qu Ping, today, you will help me set the rules!\u201dSooner or later, I would have to step over people to become the top disciple! If so, let it begin today!Today\u2019s battle will be my first battle to rise up in the Beyond the Heavens Sect!I, Chu Yang, from back then until now, have always stood in front of the wind, the peak of the waves; always ready to meet other fighters\u2019 challenges. Despite my being the lowest rank after my resurrection, I still have my dignity and courage. Standing high, you cannot avoid the cold wind.One third grade martial pupil with poor cultivation going against a second grade martial warrior. To establish his reputation? No need to wonder, this was truly a joke. The people behind Qu Ping immediately laughed, their eyes glared at Chu Yang, as if looking at a stupid fool.\u201cRubbish, you want to establish your reputation? You want to use Elder Martial Brother Qu as a stepping stone? Are you feeling feverish?\u201d\u201cThis punk is crazy\u2026\u201d\u2026\u201cJunior Martial Brother Qu, in that case, why don\u2019t you have a match with Chu Yang?\u201d The team leader who was in no hurry to make a move, Liu Yun Yan, stared at Chu Yang as he spoke slowly, \u201cDo not underestimate the enemy.\u201dHis cultivation was higher than Qu Ping, his senses were much sharper. When Chu Yang first stepped out, he talked peacefully so Liu Yun Yan did not feel anything. But now, Chu Yang\u2019s whole aura had changed. Liu Yun Yan felt a sudden surge of cold and heavy pressure.Just earlier, Liu Yun Yan looked down on him; now, he felt like a snowflake amidst the hot sun, about to vaporize any moment without a trace. At this moment, when he saw Chu Yang\u2019s keen eyes, he became a bit frightened. When the words \u2018do not underestimate the enemy\u2019 left Liu Yun Yan\u2019s mouth, the laughter suddenly stopped.This showed that with this match between Qu Ping and Chu Yang, Liu Yun Yan was not too optimistic about Qu Ping! Liu Yun Yan was a prominent character amongst the top ten. Even though he was last, his strength was not ordinary, he was a fourth grade martial warrior. A person like this would naturally be able to distinguish what\u2019s important!Even though Qu Ping was only a second grade martial warrior, compared to a third grade martial pupil like Chu Yang, the difference was as vast as heaven and earth.Martial warrior versus martial pupil, clearly genius versus retard\u2026Was there anything to worry about in this battle?Chu Yang calmly smiled. He took one step forward and said, \u201cQu Ping, make your move.\u201dWith one loud roar, Qu Ping suddenly flew forth! His movement was agile like a leopard on the hunt. Seeing that Chu Yang did not draw his weapon, he naturally did the same.Chu Yang was preparing to move when his eyes suddenly flashed. At that moment, he suddenly felt as if he was being watched, as if his every movement was being observed from the shadows.This was the superior spiritual sense that he cultivated in his previous life. This spiritual sense had helped him escape mortal danger countless times. Today, this sense suddenly arose.Only, he did not feel any killing aura from the people in the shadows. It seemed that they bore no ill will\u2026Chu Yang could, in part, guess as to the identities of these people in the shadows. Towards these secretive people, Chu Yang thought, If God has given me such a good opportunity, let me give you a little bit of excitement and fear.He did not need to look around, his countenance did not change; he only took measures to receive Qu Ping\u2019s onslaught.His actions were clearly very ordinary, but to the eyes of the spectators, there was something unfathomable about it. Chu Yang\u2019s upper body remained unmoved, but it looked as if he was rushing forward. On Qu Ping\u2019s part, he discovered that even as he was moving forward, he could not even touch the hem on Chu Yang\u2019s clothes.In the eyes of everyone present, it was clear that Chu Yang was moving offensively forward, but he was actually moving backward!At first glance, he seemed to be an offensive state, but his action was actually that of avoidance!His bottom half, his legs continued to maintain the stance of moving forward really quickly with flexible movements\u2026 (TLN: Um, so basically he was doing the moon walk.)This preposterous phenomenon reversed everyone\u2019s perceptions.In the bamboo forest, Meng Chao Ran suddenly opened his mouth wide. He was just about to cry out loud when he came to his senses and shut his mouth so quickly that his teeth slammed together making a loud \u2018clack\u2019 sound. Meng Chao Ran felt pain in both his cheeks\u2026Meng Chao Ran was still not completely calm yet; his eyes were wide circles as he stared into the yard. His gaze was full of terror as he witnessed Chu Yang\u2019s fluid movements, like jumping water and floating clouds.At the same time, in another part of the forest, two other sounds also reverberated. The sounds echoed as if turning the whole atmosphere around them into a vacuum.Chu Yang\u2019s dodging movements made the three watching thunderstruck!Without blinking, the three followed Chu Yang\u2019s movements. Their eyes were filled with excitement and joy!Snow gathers in the cloud,shocking to the heavens,as if forward, as if backwards,as if there, as if gone!This technique was familiar to everyone in the sect. Fleeting Snow Cloud Movement Technique of Beyond the Heavens Sect! Disciples of every generation have practiced it; everyone knew it. Even the lowest of servants can do a few steps.However, there had never been anyone who could achieve such effective results as Chu Yang did just now.Fleeting Snow Cloud Movement Technique was created by the founder of Beyond the Heavens Sect. That year, this patriarch went up to a mountain top to relax and soak in the warm sun in the winter. As he was lying there, he noticed a white cloud floating in the middle of sky. The color of the snow on the ground seemed to shoot up into the air as the sunlight shined on it.The light from the snow mixing with the color of the cloud created a mystical effect. There was no wind in the air, but the cloud looked as if it was floating forward, but also floating backwards. Sometimes looking as if it was dispersing, at others, as if it was gathering. One basically could not guess what the movement of the cloud was. mullingThe founder had a moment of enlightenment. After burying himself in his thoughts for two years, he created the technique called Fleeting Snow Cloud Movement Technique as a reminder of the day that heaven and earth gave him that inspiration.This technique conquered the world. In combination with sword techniques, it has not lost once. Even facing enemies with higher power, he could not be injured.Unfortunately, no matter how they tried, the later generations could not fully learn Fleeting Snow Cloud Movement Technique. Even in combination with internal qi and intensive cultivation, they could not achieve the same results as the founder. They could not use it to attack the enemy, nor could they use it to protect themselves. Therefore, it became the most useless technique of the sect.Cultivating it was useless, abandoning it seemed wasteful.Everyone thought the founder was mistaken or did not leave the real technique behind. This became the biggest regret of Beyond the Heavens Sect.Unexpectedly, a few hundred years later, the mystery of this technique has once again revealed itself with Chu Yang.How did he use it like that?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euQu Ping attacked like mad, but could not even touch the hem of Chu Yang\u2019s clothes. The more he tried to attack, the more unnerved he became. He was a second grade martial warrior. How could he not beat a third grade martial pupil? His martial brothers were watching, how could he lose face?Qu Ping\u2019s breathing became more labored. He decided to pull out his sword, but before his hand touched the sword, a shadow flashed in front of him and Chu Yang suddenly appeared. Qu Ping was horrified. Before he could dodge, there was a \u2018pow\u2019. He was hit right in the nose!His nose immediately bled; he was in such pain that tears and snot streamed down on his face.\u201cBe good, don\u2019t cry. This is for your own good.\u201d Chu Yang said in an appeasing manner, but there was no feeling behind it.His body was like a swimming fish. Afterwards, there were two sounds \u2018bam\u2019 \u2018bam\u2019. He had hit the side of Qu Ping\u2019s left and right eye. Suddenly, there was a newly made panda.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 23 \u2013 Ulterior motivesQu Ping was so angry he almost fainted.The opponent\u2019s strength was clearly lower than mine! If his strength was equal to mine, then the last three moves would have sent me to my grave. The opponent clearly used all his strength in those three moves, but I only received some superficial injuries.This proves that the opponent\u2019s strength was indeed much weaker than mine!Even so, I consecutively suffered. What sort of logic was this?Qu Ping was furious. The enemy even goes as far as talking to him as if he were a crying child. The fact that he was indeed tearing made him even more embarrassed and angry to the point that he wanted to die.He growled. The sound of his sword rang; it has left its sheath. With a wooshing sound like the wind, Qu Ping immediately went for the kill.Liu Yun Yan said quietly, \u201cNot good!\u201d Although he did not understand what was happening, the current Qu Ping\u2019s recklessness was definitely not a rival for Chu Yang\u2019s sophisticated movements. Moreover, his sword technique has placed him in an extremely dangerous situation.If he did not pull out his sword, then the enemy would not pull out his sword either. So at worst, he would only suffer a few kicks and punches. Not mentioning that his strength was much stronger than the opponent, even a few more kicks and punches would not result in any major injuries nor would it cause any big issue.But now that he has pulled out his sword, his opponent had reason to do it as well. Now this incident no longer just involved a few punches and kicks\u2026Metallic light flashed. The sword seemed infinitely dark; Qu Ping\u2019s countenance also darkened. His eyes were murderous. He attacked in a frenzy.In Chu Yang\u2019s eyes, there suddenly appeared a glimmer of killing intent.Even though you are not a good person, you did give Shi Qian Shan a beating. I am in a very good mood. I originally did not want to hurt you, but you want to kill me?You are asking for death!Chu Yang still only used his hands. He constantly moved to dodge the flurry of swords.Qu Ping\u2019s sword seemed to be everywhere, but he could not even touch Chu Yang\u2019s clothes. His killing intent seeped into his bones, growing stronger\u2026Qu Ping roared and suddenly jumped up. His sword glittered in mid-air and quickly dropped down. Heavenly Sea Inversion Technique!This was one of the most powerful killing techniques of Beyond the Heavens Sect. Only when entering the rank of martial warrior are you eligible to cultivate this technique.Chu Yang suddenly moved forward instead of backing up. He kept body small and close to the ground.This was a deadly weakness of Heavenly Sea Inversion Technique. Because the starting movement required jumping up, leaving the bottom exposed. Moreover, the exposed area was very big.When Qu Ping just made his move, his opponent was no longer in front of him. His senses screamed danger. He barely had time to think when a very tiny sound was heard from behind him.What sound was that?When he still did not know what was going on behind him, the light of a sword suddenly shined. There was screaming from around him!All this time, Chu Yang did not pull out his sword. But at this critical moment, he did!When Qu Ping was still contemplating, there was suddenly a painful feeling on his back, followed immediately by his left thigh, right thigh, then left shoulder and right shoulder.Qu Ping screamed loudly and dropped straight from the air to the ground.The middle of his back, left shoulder, right shoulder, left thigh, right thigh, all five spots were spurting blood. With the exception of his back, which had a superficial wound, the other four spots had holes from the back to the front!The whole atmosphere became heavy! Everybody could recognize the movement Chu Yang used. It was the Five Point Flower Backhand Sword Technique. A very normal, very ordinary, beginner sword technique of Beyond the Heavens Sect. Completely without anything special. It was commonly used to strengthen the body and to create a basic foundation.However, his movements were extremely precise. When Qu Ping jumped up, his position was like a thousand soldiers bearing down. Chu Yang immediately moved behind him without looking back. He used the Five Point Flower Backhand Sword Technique as easily as if he were practicing. The sword landed on each point on the body as if it were a drawing on a book!Chu Yang\u2019s mastery had allowed him to see Qu Ping\u2019s moves before they were made. Moreover, his movements were agile and quick. He drew his sword with barely a sound. Qu Ping never thought that tiny sound was the sound of a sword being unsheathed. While his entire concentration was focused on the front, how could he expect that within a flash his enemy would be behind him?Qu Ping roared loudly, he turned around and in desperation, threw his sword. He currently no longer wished to win, he only wanted to die together with his enemy. The sword, as if lit, suddenly flashed, missed its target and flew straight into Purple Bamboo Forest instead.Nobody knew where the sword had flown to. However, Kong Jing Feng, who was standing comfortably in the Purple Bamboo Forest watching the excitement and contemplating on Chu Yang\u2019s Fleeting Snow Cloud Movement Technique, did not have a chance to react when the sword flew towards him.Only a \u2018swoosh\u2019 was heard when the sword pierced through Kong Jing Feng\u2019s clothes and landed on the ground under him. Kong Jing Feng\u2019s eyes widened, his mouth dropped, looking at the glimmering sword blade beneath him. He could not help but take a deep breath in. His eyes almost fell out of their sockets and his forehead was dripping with sweat. Within a moment, his back was cold with sweat as well\u2026The sword landed between his legs, missing it by less than a finger-length. There was even a hole in the pants underneath his robe. It had shrunk itself into a ball, but there was still a dense cold air surrounding the sword\u2026 (TLN: it being his, erm, manhood)Kong Jing Feng\u2019s face turned white. Unable to control himself, he said in a low voice, \u201cThis\u2026 this was truly a blessing from the heavens\u2026\u201dChu Yang\u2019s body swayed as he used the Fleeting Snow Cloud Movement Technique to quickly close in on Qu Ping. There suddenly appeared a fog on his right hand, bringing with it a frosty cold air. In a flash, his hand landed on Qu Ping\u2019s back.\u2018Pow!\u2019A powerful palm!After a successful move, he immediately turned around and backed away three meters.When he struck this palm strike, the three standing in the Purple Bamboo Forest all saw clearly that a frosty air came out of Chu Yang\u2019s hand. All at once, their eyes widened and their mouths dropped agape. They almost lost control and yelled out loud.\u2018Pow!\u2019 (TLN: It was a different sound from the previous one, similar to pow, but I can\u2019t think of any other onomatopoeia. Please give me some suggestions.)Qu Ping flew into the air like a rubber ball. And after, fell down to the ground like a piece of meat. He cried pitiful in pain as his body curled up, wriggling on the ground, sweating as if he had taken a bath. When he was still in mid-air, blood was spilling everywhere, but the moment he fell down, a layer of frost quickly covered his whole body. The mysterious cold qi caused his wounds to seal up and the blood to stop bleeding.Qu Ping was writhing on the ground. His tragic appearance made it hard for people to look at. Liu Yun Yan\u2019s group became stupefied, feeling as if they were in a dream. No one could believe that Chu Yang would have attacked with such cruelty!To say nothing of the palm, his previous sword move had essentially handicapped Qu Ping!There appeared a subtle smile on Chu Yang. He was forced to use his sword, but the Fleeting Snow Cloud Movement Technique and along with palm strike had ulterior motives. The movement technique was used to avoid Qu Ping and also to secretly show the others who were watching. Moreover the purpose of the palm strike, with its cold frost, was aimed at\u2026 Seven Shades Congregation Grounds!Seven Shades Absolute Saint Palm! This was the secret technique of Beyond the Heavens Sect, the most powerful technique!The biggest reason that generations of disciples wanted to advance into the Seven Shades Congregation Grounds was to use the extreme cold air there to cultivate Seven Shades Absolute Saint Palm!Chu Yang used this palm technique not to attack Qu Ping because by that time, Qu Ping had already lost all capacity to fight back. Then what was purpose behind the palm strike? The reason was to tell the silent observers, \u201cCompared to others, I am already a step ahead!\u201dAs for why he went one step ahead\u2026 This point, Chu Yang believed that Meng Chao Ran will wipe his ass for him. In this, Chu Yang was absolutely certain. (TLN: A bit vulgar, but I think you guys can take it, right? Basically, he knows Meng Chao Ran will provide an explanation for him)\u201cChu Yang, you are truly cruel!\u201d Liu Yun Yan looked at Qu Ping\u2019s miserable face. His eyes narrowed and immediately looked at Chu Yang. Grinding his teeth, he said, \u201cYou dare to fight a fellow disciple like this.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euChu Yang pouted. As he tilted his sword, a drop of blood slowly dripped down. The direction of that sword tip pointed directly to an unconscious Shi Qian Shan. Everyone was momentarily quiet.Qu Ping was a fellow disciple and Shi Qian Shan was not? They were the ones that started the fight first by beating Shi Qian Shan to his current miserable condition. With the evidence right in front of their faces, what right did they have to call Chu Yang cruel?Chu Yang laughed coldly and said, \u201cFirst, you came to Purple Bamboo Garden to cause trouble, without the permission of the elders. Second, you were the ones who beat people from Purple Bamboo Garden first. Third, \u2026 we already agreed that I would help elder martial brother a little, you have not forgotten that, have you?\u201dHelp\u2026 doing a favor?Looking at Qu Ping\u2019s questionable condition, it seemed he already half lost his life. Everyone could not help but shudder. Help\u2026 help like this?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was a way of giving you justice.\u201dWith regret, he said, \u201cBut as people, we cannot go overboard, you should not have created trouble at Purple Bamboo Garden like that. Let me ask you, did you consider Purple Bamboo Garden\u2019s reputation at all? We are all brothers and sisters from the same sect; a rose and leaves are of the same root, why did you seek to yank us out like this?\u201dChu Yang frowned, \u201cYou hit people\u2026 that\u2019s okay, but time and time again, you wanted to make yourselves out to be the victim. You\u2026 ! How are you so shameless?\u201dAs these words were spoken, almost everyone was so angry that they wanted to choke up blood. In the bamboo forest, three people who were watching secretly also felt like their brains were scrambled.How can be there be such shameless people? They already had the upper hand and yet still cried for pity.\u201cDo you see? I easily won with just a little bit of my abilities, so you can imagine Eldest Martial Brother Shi Qian Shan\u2019s abilities. Compared to me, he is many times stronger!\u201dFull of anguish, Chu Yang said, \u201cEldest Martial Brother\u2019s martial cultivation is beyond all of you, but he did not fight back and let you hit him as you pleased. What else do you want? Do you need to kill someone to relieve your anger?\u201dHearing that, Liu Yun Yan\u2019s group of people turned around and looked at the unconscious Shi Qian Shan, feeling a little uneasy.That\u2019s right, if the junior martial brother\u2019s abilities were already that incredible, then Shi Qian Shan who was the eldest martial brother, must be so much more\u2026How could he possibly be a weak guy?It seemed that at the next ranking competition for the sect\u2019s eldest martial brother position (TLN: aka top disciple, refer to chapter 16), Shi Qian Shan is to be a rival for everyone.\u201cToday, you have hurt us, but we still did you a favor. Even though we suffered some disadvantages, but we are not the ungrateful type. Furthermore, we are disciples of the same sect; there are no reasons to quarrel. Let us call this even\u2026\u201d With generosity and leniency, Chu Yang continued, \u201cOut of respect for Second Elder Martial Uncle, I will not pursue this matter any further.\u201dLiu Yun Yan\u2019s people felt their head spinning. They were so overwhelmed that they could barely breathe and almost fainted on the spot. You beat someone into a bloody pulp, barely alive. And you say you\u2019re going to let us go? Further still, you used that tone of generosity and respect\u2026\u201cOf course, if all of you elder martial brothers also want my help, I will not refuse. I always believe that finding happiness in helping others is a virtue. Therefore, I steadfastly remember all the teachings of the sect.\u201d Chu Yang smiled in embarrassment. \u201cEven though the things I said seems boastful, but it is true that I am that type of person, always finding happiness in helping others. It has become a habit for me, helping those in need, rescuing those in danger, especially when it comes to brothers and sisters from the sect. After all, we are all members of the same family. Yes, even if the head must drop and the blood must flow, we must help each other wholeheartedly.\u201dLiu Yun Yan looked at Qu Ping still sprawled in the yard and shuddered. This is what you call helping others? Help, mother******, we are not fools!The gazes of the others were focused on Liu Yun Yan. They were waiting for his cue, but Liu Yun Yan was in the difficult position of riding on the tiger\u2019s back. (TLN: closest English equivalent is between a rock and a hard place. Basically, he\u2019s alright as long as he is riding on the tiger\u2019s back but he can\u2019t get off.) Even though he was ranked number ten and his martial strength was much higher than Qu Ping, after seeing Chu Yang in action, he knew that he was absolutely not Chu Yang\u2019s opponent!With such monstrous techniques, even he would have suffered from those attacks!If he had attacked and unfortunately lost at the hands of Chu Yang, it would have been devastating to Locking Clouds Peak! This would have been a responsibility that he could not bear.\u201cChu Yang, you are good! This matter stops here today!\u201dLiu Yun Yan thought for a moment, then quickly said, \u201cIf the mountain won\u2019t move, then the water will. The Ranking Competition for the sect\u2019s eighth generation will start soon; at that time Locking Clouds Peak will have a chance to face off with Purple Bamboo Garden. At that time, we will have a chance to end it once and for all in front of the whole sect.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dThe seven others carried Qu Ping and went back towards the direction they came from. Before going, they turned to look at Chu Yang one more time; their hearts were filled with fear, jealousy\u2026 and all other type of feelings.Being from the same sect, who would dare to seriously harm another disciple? Even when they beat Shi Qian Shan, they had restraint. They did not hit him in any vital areas, they only wanted to break a few bones so he would suffer and repent.However, Chu Yang, on his first move, pierced Qu Ping\u2019s both arms and legs. No one would dare use such cruel methods.Chu Yang watched as the seven slowly faded away into the distance. His countenance was pensive and serious.Chu Yang was completely victorious, that was indisputable!However, no one knew that from this battle, Chu Yang has realized his own weakness.This battle, in terms of experience, there was nothing worth mentioning. Chu Yang\u2019s skills and experience were a few decades more than that of Qu Ping. Therefore, each time the opponent started an attack, he was able to predict their movements and devise countermeasures. He had an absolute advantage!Chu Yang had always thought that even though their martial strengths were higher than his, but with his experience and skills, beating them would have been without any difficulty.However, this battle taught him that he was wrong!Experience and skill did not mean everything. When an enraged Qu Ping went straight for him, Chu Yang knew that he only needed to use one finger to push on the sword tip, then he could send the sword sideways and thus put Qu Ping in a dangerous situation of no return. After that, he only needed one strong move to crush Qu Ping\u2019s dantian!In fact, he did just so. Only, when his finger touched the sword, it could not pushed the sword away. He went as far as using his arm, trying with all his might; but he could not do anything!Qu Ping was a second grade martial warrior, compared to a third grade martial pupil, he was stronger by countless times. With his martial strength, no matter what strategy he used, Chu Yang was not Qu Ping\u2019s opponent!Out of necessity, Chu Yang had to use his sword! Because merely fighting by fists, Chu Yang did not have any ability to cause injury to his opponent.To the spectators, Chu Yang\u2019s use of Fleeting Snow Cloud Movement Technique seemed flexible and effortless, but no one knew the amount of pressure involved with each movement!In fact, even Qu Ping did not know that within that brief period, how many times Chu Yang had to rethink his tactics and change his attack. He should be proud of the fact that he forced Chu Yang to use his sword.Even after pulling his sword, Chu Yang did not dare to hesitate. If he hesitated, the enemy could counter attack in full force! Then, Chu Yang would not have been able to defend himself because he had nothing else after executing his sword technique.Fleeting Snow Cloud Movement Technique, once cultivated completely, would prevent anyone from being able to attack you. But when attacking others, a weakness will appear! Even though Qu Ping did not catch that flaw, that does not mean others wouldn\u2019t!Defensively, it was absolutely flawless. But avoidance was far from victorious; attacking was the only means to winning. However, the perfection of the technique was lost during attack and would surely show its flaw.Everything is interconnected! When you attack the weakness of your opponent, then your weakness would be shown to him!Chu Yang was full of thought when his eyes suddenly glimmered with a flash of light.Strength! Strength is essential!Cunning and experience only works with opponents of the same or lesser level. However, in the face of a powerful opponent, cunning and experience is only a joke.Strength was the thing that Chu Yang currently lacked most.Tan Tan, who was standing on the side, has long been stunned since a while ago. Suddenly, at this point, he yelled out enthusiastically, \u201cChu Yang! You are very\u2026 very handsome\u2026 very outstanding\u2026\u201dAfter thinking for a moment, he added, \u201cOf course, compared to me, you are still a little less\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHandsome\u2026 haha\u2026\u201d (TLN: still Tan Tan)Chu Yang nodded, \u201cTan Tan, starting tomorrow, every morning, you and I will cultivate together. I hope that one day, I will be as handsome as you!\u201dTan Tan\u2019s face immediately became downcast. Then he laughingly said, \u201cElder martial brother\u2026 then is it possible for you to be more handsome than me?\u201dChu Yang smiled and said, \u201cTan Tan, you see, currently Beyond the Heavens Sect is filled with people who bully the weak and fear the strong, who do things and dare not admit it. It is almost time for the Ranking Competition and these people will be the ones to inherit Beyond the Heavens Sect in the future.\u201dChu Yang\u2019s voice was slightly as if speaking for someone else to hear. There was an air of mockery in his voice as he continued, \u201cThe burden of Beyond the Heavens Sect will sooner or later fall on these people, but how could people like them take care of beyond the heavens sect? I fear that they would more likely bring forth the destruction of the sect! Tan Tan, I hope you can become strong and be able to protect yourself. So people won\u2019t have to die for you in vain.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Shi Qian Shan was still unconscious, so he had no inkling of the events that passed. He also did not know that after today\u2019s fight, he would become famous amongst the disciples of Beyond the Heavens Sect.After returning, Liu Yun Yan\u2019s group immediately spread the news far and wide: Shi Qian Shan was a hidden talent and was the number one opponent for all the top disciples.Chu Yang was only his junior martial brother and he could beat Qu Ping! Then, how monstrous was the elder martial brother, Shi Qian Shan?Only by looking at Qu Ping\u2019s injuries was enough for the disciples of the nine peaks to put Shi Qian Shan in the rankings of dangerous characters.In his comatose state, Shi Qian Shan could not dream that he had unintentionally become a major character in Beyond the Heavens Sect. The future truly could not be predicted; a person gains fame from current events, there\u2019s no way to know ahead of time\u2026Chu Yang\u2019s keen spiritual sense perceived the people watching his fight from within the bamboo forest. Even though he did not know who they were, he was able to recognize that they were high ranking members of Beyond the Heavens Sect.That was why Chu Yang said those confusing lines to Tan Tan; even though he had really intended to give Tan Tan advice, it was mainly aimed at the three people.If Beyond the Heavens Sect was to depend on those useless people, then it will never grow. Only I, Chu Yang, can take care of it.If he wanted to achieve the top disciple position and enter into Seven Shades Congregation Grounds to acquire the Nine Tribulations Sword fragment, then his every word and action had to be noticed by those high ranking people.Otherwise, he would have to wait for four years, when Beyond the Heavens Sect was to be destroyed, to get the sword fragment. But by then, what would be the point?If he openly got the attention of high ranking members of Beyond the Heavens Sect, then he would become a core member of the sect. At that time, he would only need to announce, \u201cLeave all of the burdens of Beyond the Heavens Sect to me!\u201dArrogance! Let\u2019s give arrogance a try once, and see how that turns out.A long time after Chu Yang and Tan Tan had gone, there was movement in the bamboo forest. Within the endless purple of the bamboo, there suddenly appeared three silhouettes. All three had a thoughtful look upon their faces. Chu Yang\u2019s last few words seemed to have hit its target.Meng Chao Ran moved; he immediately appeared next to the other two without making a sound. He said with a smile, \u201cEldest Martial Brother, Seventh Martial Brother, your visit to Purple Bamboo Garden gave me a shock.\u201dThe two were Sect Master of Beyond the Heavens Sect, Wu Yun Liang and Master of Dream Clouds Peak, Kong Jing Feng. However, at this time, Kong Jing Feng\u2019s face was pale and white. There was a hole in his pants where the sound of wind blowing through could be heard, making the Master of Dream Clouds Peak hold his legs together in embarrassment. His position had a strange appearance\u2026\u201cWe should be the ones who are frightened!\u201d Wu Yun Liang said. \u201cJunior Martial Brother, just you being secretive is not a problem. But why did you train such a perfect disciple and not say anything? Just now, we were almost endangered by your disciple!\u201dKong Jing Feng nodded repeatedly, in agreement with Wu Yun Liang. \u201cEspecially me, I was so scared that little Jing Feng almost shriveled up.\u201dThese words truly carried some dark thoughts.Chu Yang\u2019s performance, regardless of whichever technique you looked at, was enough for the two high ranking experts of Beyond the Heavens Sect to be surprised, even shocked!There was the ephemeral Fleeting Snow Cloud Movement Technique, there was the frightening Five Point Flower Backhand Sword Technique. In addition, there was the incredible mental clarity and the ability to seize the opportunity. These have made the two very important characters of Beyond the Heavens Sect extremely surprised.The two thought to themselves that if they had the same martial power as Chu Yang, in today\u2019s situation, they would not have been able to act so high-handedly and dominate as Chu Yang did.This disciple of Meng Chao Ran was definitely skilled!With a sad smile, Meng Chao Ran said, \u201cYou almost fell over in amazement. As for me, my jaw almost fell to the ground. Elder Martial Brother, look at my eyes, see how they are still red? I could not believe that my disciple could be so monstrous\u2026.\u201dAs he said this a slight hint of annoyance appeared on his face\u2026Wu Yun Liang and Kong Jing Feng were smiling since earlier. But suddenly Kong Jing Feng became shocked. He realized the meaning behind Meng Chao Ran\u2019s words. \u201cYou are saying\u2026 is it possible that kid\u2019s martial arts was not taught by you?\u201dMeng Chao Ran\u2019s eyes shifted; he didn\u2019t want to admit the truth, but ultimately, he sighed in resignment, \u201cEven though I did teach him, but even I\u2026 \u201dThe two others at this moment were so astonished that their hairs stood on end. If the teacher who taught the technique did not manage complete cultivation; then when the disciple was successful, there could only be one explanation: heavenly endowment! Heavenly endowment second to none!Wu Yun Liang had originally thought that Meng Chao Ran had mastered the cultivation of Fleeting Snow Cloud Movement Technique; he was inwardly filled with joy. Now hearing Meng Chao Ran saying thus, he was temporarily dazed. After a long time, he said with a contorted smile, \u201cThen that Fleeting Snow Cloud Movement Technique was due to\u2026\u201dMeng Chao Ran nodded resolutely. \u201cI, myself, did not successfully cultivate\u2026\u201dBoth Wu Yun Liang and Kong Jing Feng were bewildered!\u201cCould it be that he cultivated it by himself?\u201d Wu Yun Liang said, as he twirled his beard in agitation.\u201cI, too, do not know,\u201d Meng Chao Ran sighed and continued, \u201cMy disciple is extremely clever. It is possible that he cultivated it himself!\u201dThe other two were dumbfounded. Meng Chao Ran relaxed his arms and shrugged. The action seemed to say \u201cI give up on this subject!\u201dThe three of them were normally very serious in front of the disciples, but without them around, they were very relaxed.\u201cRegardless of how, from your three disciples\u2026\u201d Wu Yun Liang mused for a while, then said, \u201cThere appeared a talent\u2026\u201dAs he spoke, he laughed loudly. \u201cWith his cultivation, he absolutely would not have been able to notice that we were watching in secret. But his last few statements, were clearly a message to us. I am going crazy because of this\u2026\u201d\u201cA heavenly talent was born, a useless person was exposed!\u201d Meng Chao Ran said these words with a grotesque countenance.It was not that he did not care for Shi Qian Shan, he just did not like his methods. Meng Chao Ran was very disappointed in Shi Qian Shan. To openly triumph over the enemy was the way to rise above others in Jiang Hu. Plots and manipulations would also work, but the purpose was totally different in nature.It was still possible that Shi Qian Shan could traverse Jiang Hu by scheming. Today it was clear that Shi Qian Shan could fight, but he chose to get beaten up and not fight back! That made what little hope Meng Chao Ran had for him disappear completely.Heroes can be patient, but in being cowardly, you will never become powerful!\u201cUseless? You\u2019re talking about Shi Qian Shan?\u201d In Wu Yun Liang\u2019s eyes there was a distant coldness. It seemed that Shi Qian Shan has left a bad impression on the Master of Beyond the Heavens Sect.Meng Chao Ran lamented.\u201cThe Nine Peaks and One Garden of our Beyond the Heavens Sect, has almost 800 disciples. Every master has a few disciples like that. Junoir Martial Brother, do not let this weigh you down! Only large waves can bring up sand from the deep! Genius or useless, we will all eventually turn into a pile of dry bones!\u201d With a deep look, Wu Yun Liang spoke slowly. \u201cAmongst your disciples, Chu Yang is more than enough to compensate for all regrets. This kid, Chu Yang, his methods were cruel and decisive, his thinking thorough. His words were bold and rational. Moreover, he had a breakthrough in cultivation. Truly a rare talent, not simple at all\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euKong Jing Feng also nodded in agreement. Today, these two had come to observe. The first purpose was to see what Li Jinsong\u2019s disciples would do. But more importantly, it was to look at the hole that made Li Jian Yin break his leg. Lastly, it was to see if Beyond the Heavens Sect had a genius with a superior mind and capability, the one they were searching for all along.After hearing Wu Qian Qian\u2019s report, the two had suspected that Chu Yang pretended to be a pig, to eat a tiger (TLN: common saying in Chinese, something like a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing). Otherwise, how could there be such coincidences? The only thing was, they found it hard to believe that there was a disciple with such capabilities and experience in the eight generation.So they came to investigate!However, today, after watching Chu Yang deal with Qu Ping, they immediately knew that there was no need to investigate. It was absolutely caused by him! This person called Chu Yang, was unquestionably a force to be reckoned with.The current state of Beyond the Heavens Sect, can be summed up as internal troubles and external aggression. They really needed talents, especially amongst the youth. That was why Wu Yun Liang regarded Chu Yang with such great importance. This regard was what Chu Yang had desired! Otherwise, he would not have wasted his energy to do anything!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even at this hour you\u2019re still in the mood to joke around.\u201d\u201cWhy you rather have me crying?\u201d Even though Wu Yun Liang was being facetious, his countenance was very serious. He slowly said, \u201cThis Chu Yang, you need to cultivate him well. In our Beyond the Heavens Sect, the number of people like him are too few.\u201d (TLN: Like, zero.)Meng Chao Ran nodded and said with a sigh, \u201cThere\u2019s no other way! Since we no longer hold the title \u2018National Sect\u2019 of the Great State of Zhao and suffered from a severe loss of power, no one in court supports us, government officials treat us with discrimination and other large sects harass us. Any talented disciple, they could be stolen away or killed during competitions. Beyond the Heavens Sect\u2019s destiny is very precarious\u2026 If we cannot protect the talents of the sect, then I am afraid that in our generation, Beyond the Heavens Sect will cease to exist.\u201dMeng Chao Ran\u2019s words included some very serious reminders and warnings.Upon Wu Yun Liang\u2019s face there was a pained smile. He and Kong Jing Feng looked at each other. After, his wrinkled face slowly relaxed, he smiled and said, \u201cPerhaps, you\u2019re afraid we would sell off your disciple?\u201dWith a humph, Meng Chao Ran said, \u201cYou can\u2019t be too careful! Beyond the Heavens Sect is not what it used to be.\u201dWu Yun Liang sighed and said, \u201cI know! So you guys are still dissatisfied with the ranking competition amongst the disciples in the sect. Indeed, Beyond the Heavens Sect is currently on the decline. If we have a competition like this, distinguished disciples will be known to the enemies and they will be put in danger. However\u2026 it must be done.\u201dMeng Chao Ran clasped his hands behind his back, \u201cI think you only want to maintain the archaic traditions of Beyond the Heavens Sect. If you are determined not to change them, then we have nothing else to say.\u201dMeng Chao Ran was usually a pacifist, but he had just said these harsh words. Wu Yun Liang, who had been in the sect with him for decades, had never heard words like these before. At this point, Wu Yun Liang suddenly realized, that this junior martial brother was very dissatisfied.With a sigh Wu Yun Liang said severely, \u201cIf I really wanted to change things, I only need to say so. But the reason I kept this old rule, is because I wanted to cultivate pure metal from inside the fiery hell.\u201dWu Yun Liang cooled down, he slowly said, \u201cThere are currently 800 disciples in the eighth generation of Beyond the Heavens Sect. Whereas our seventh generation currently only has 70 left. Of the masters from the sixth generation, there barely remain ten people. As for the fifth generation, there is currently only one, the Ninth Martial Great Uncle\u2026\u201dHis face strained as he gritted his teeth, \u201cIf my plans succeed, then of the thousand people of Beyond the Heavens Sect, the ones who are capable of surviving will not exceed a hundred. These people will become the foundation for Beyond the Heavens Sect to rise to its glorious peak.\u201d\u201cThe useless need not be kept! The mediocre are not needed at all!!!\u201d Wu Yun Liang took two slow steps and in a dreadful low voice, \u201cEven I, Wu Yun Liang, when sacrifice is needed, will sacrifice!\u201d\u201cA sect declining is not because of external pressure. It is due to internal disputes and lack of unity. Of this, our Beyond the Heavens Sect is a perfect example.\u201d Wu Yun Liang said cryptically, \u201cIf a sect wants to rise, it has to go through blood and fire to be reborn!!!\u201dMeng Chao Ran sighed, \u201cThese outstanding disciples, if targeted by the enemies, then it is us who have pushed them into danger. But the same goes with countless things in life. Only in overcoming everything, can they become the pillars of the sect.\u201dWu Yun Liang said casually, \u201cIf we cannot overcome and all get killed, then Beyond the Heavens Sect will no longer exist. What I want is not to prolong that last breath, but to give our all in the final fight.\u201dKong Jing Feng nodded, \u201cEldest Martial Brother is right. Better to have one glorious moment, then a waning hundred years!\u201dMeng Chao Ran\u2019s pupils suddenly narrowed, \u201cEldest Martial Brother! The decline of the sect is greatly related to the Zhao Dynasty. But now you have plans to revive the sect. Perhaps\u2026 ?\u201d\u201cExactly!\u201dWu Yun Liang said pensively, \u201cThese past ten years, whenever I wasn\u2019t at the sect, then I was at Iron Cloud Nation. The Zhao Dynasty has always bullied us. What need do we have to cling to them? Great state what? There are no guarantees that it will always prosper and never fall.\u201dMeng Chao Ran was shocked. But upon seeing Kong Jing Feng\u2019s calm countenance, he immediately understood that Elder Martial Brother Kong already knew about this.\u201cEldest Martial Brother, this is too dangerous!\u201d Meng Chao Ran took a deep breath, his face still looked worried.\u201cFind fortune in danger!\u201d Wu Yun Liang said blandly. \u201cThe first time a sect needs to rise up is difficult but not impossible. Only, after succeeding, if it declines again, rising the second time will be much more difficult. We need to prepare carefully if the sect were to perish.\u201dMeng Chao Ran sighed and did not say anymore.\u201cThree days ago, I dispatched Ninth Junior Martial Brother along with Qian Qian, Xue Ye, and Mu Shang (TLN: previously mentioned as the top two disciples on that \u2018list\u2019) to secretly go to Iron Cloud Nation. First, to complete a task. Second, for them to have a chance to go into Jiang Hu and learn a bit.\u201dAfter hearing this, Kong Jing Feng became terrified. \u201cEldest Martial Brother, how could you let Qian Qian go like that?!\u201d\u201cI thought you would certainly try to stop it if you knew, that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d Wu Yun Liang replied casually. \u201cIt has been three days. Even if you want to bring her back, you can\u2019t.\u201dKong Jing Feng immediately raised his voice, \u201cI have no issue with Ninth Junior Martial Brother bringing Xue Ye and Mu Shang, but why did you let Qian Qian go along? This trip is very dangerous. Moreover, all the major sects are like tigers on the prowl for us\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s up to fate!!!\u201d Wu Yun Liang said coldly. \u201cA few days ago, when you and I were talking about the female disciples of the sect, I had already thought about this. Now, let Qian Qian go out there and hone her skills in Jiang Hu!\u201d\u201cHoning skills in Jiang Hu\u2026 our Beyond the Heavens Sect has many such female disciples. Those with beauty like Qian Qian are not few, but why do you have to send Qian Qian?\u201d Kong Jing Feng was livid. \u201cShe is your daughter!\u201d\u201cShe is my daughter, then the other female disciples are without parents? Are they not precious to them?\u201d Wu Yun Liang said, burdened. \u201cShould I pamper my daughter forever?\u201dKong Jing Feng stomped his foot in indignation, his gaze became fiery as he stared as his elder martial brother. \u201cShe\u2019s not just your daughter, she\u2019s our niece! You can\u2019t let her take such risks.\u201d\u201cBecause she is my daughter, that\u2019s why she has to take the responsibility instead of other female disciples.\u201d Wu Yun Liang said coldly. \u201cMy daughter is not a precious princess. If she keeps hiding and let her martial sisters face danger\u2026 then I would rather not have this daughter\u2026\u201d\u201cBeyond the Heavens Sect is amidst boiling water and burning fire and that fire is slowly growing. If we want to rise again, then we can\u2019t avoid paying a big price. No one can be an exception to this. Not you, nor I, not even my daughter!!!\u201d After he finished speaking, Wu Yun Liang immediately turned around. His whole body stiffened. The two others could not see that his eyes were quivering.Let\u2019s hope\u2026 Qian Qian can return safely.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euI am a father, but I have heartlessly sent my daughter to carry out such dangerous duties. Is it possible that I am truly without feelings?But I am not only a father, I am the master of a thousand disciples of Beyond the Heavens Sect.When it is necessary, even if all must be sacrificed, it must be done. However, if only one person needs to be sacrificed, then\u2026 then let it be my daughter. Because I am the master of Beyond the Heavens Sect.Wu Yun Liang clenched his teeth, his jaw trembled and then returned to normal. He still did not turn around. But said in a slightly hoarse voice, \u201cJunior Martial Brother, you must teach Chu Yang well. That Fleeting Snow Cloud Movement Technique\u2026\u201d He paused and contemplated for a second. Then calmly said, \u201cLet him cultivate well. If there are any secrets to it\u2026 he can keep them to himself. Or you both can hold on to them. But you must remember, no third party can know of them.Meng Chao Ran pondered for a second then said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t we teach it to the entire sect? If we teach this technique, the power of Beyond the Heavens Sect could double. That would be my guess.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The sect is not yet completely taken care of; there are too many spies. Letting the secrets be exposed means that we would not be the only ones who would be able to cultivate it. But this great skill would become an advantage for our enemies.\u201d Wu Yun Liang said casually. \u201cSo before everything is finished, we must absolutely never disclose this to the outside. Moreover, you must prepare a good technique for him to use to divert the enemy\u2026\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Chao Ran understood. Wu Yun Liang saying these words proved that the current situation of Beyond the Heavens Sect has reached critical. It also demonstrated that his previous speculation was a bit too optimistic.Used to divert, divert who?Currently no one from the outside knew about it. Only a few of Second Elder Martial Brother\u2019s disciples knew, yet he still wanted to divert. Then\u2026\u201cAlso, Chu Yang\u2019s Seven Shades Absolute Saint Palm\u2026 how did he cultivate the cold qi? This is extremely strange. But still, don\u2019t bother him about it.\u201d Wu Yun Liang said thoughtfully. \u201cLet\u2019s wait until his cultivation reaches a higher level, then we will let him enter Seven Shades Congregation Grounds and increase his cultivation further!\u201d\u201cThis disciple of mine, even though his talent reaches the heavens, but currently his martial strength is still very low. We should not use him just yet. I need to evaluate everything first.\u201d Meng Chao Ran replied as if still in thought.\u201cJunior Martial Brother Meng, I had previously planned that your disciple Shi Qian Shan would be a suitable choice with his thorough planning. But now it seems Shi Qian Shan cannot be used. However, Chu Yang\u2026\u201d Wu Yun Liang smiled. \u201cWe could use him.\u201d\u201cUse?\u201d Meng Chao Ran\u2019s eyebrow rose. His gaze became sharp.\u201cCurrently, we do not have any resources inside Iron Cloud Nation. Our sect needs to have someone to secretly set roots.\u201d Wu Yun Liang said quietly. \u201cAfter Chu Yang\u2019s performance today, there is no doubt that he is an appropriate choice. How about we send him as a delegate?\u201dMeng Chao Ran was astonished and did not speak for a long time. Eventually he said, \u201cThere is no doubt that this is a good opportunity. But it is also a dangerous road. Countries like Iron Cloud have countless martial experts. Once discovered, we would be flooded with disaster. Chu Yang is still too young! I hope Eldest Martial Brother will rethink this carefully\u2026\u201d\u201cHow could you become a talent without weathering through a storm?\u201d Wu Yun Liang said. \u201cAlways living at the boundary between life and death and struggling in extreme danger, that\u2019s how you become a character in the realm of mountains and clouds. Furthermore, I can guarantee you, other disciples might be exposed, but Chu Yang will certainly not!\u201dWhen he finished talking, he glanced at Kong Jing Feng. The two bid Meng Chao Ran goodbye and left.As the two silhouettes disappeared from sight, Meng Chao Ran stood sadly in front of Purple Bamboo Garden. At a glance, his countenance seemed somber.Meng Chao Ran sighed. He muttered, \u201cEldest Martial Brother, there are some things\u2026 that cannot be achieved with the strength of a sect like ours. Two countries in conflict, our Beyond the Heavens Sect is just so little\u2026 what can we do? We were forced to take risks, but placing all hope into a single door is unthinkable\u2026 Just one mistake and bones will be crushed, flesh will be melted\u2026 Too much planning and things will fall apart\u2026 Beyond the Heavens Sect is currently in no condition to withstand such a shakeup\u2026\u201dMeng Chao Ran had a vague feeling as if the whole world was being lifted by a huge vortex and Beyond the Heavens Sect sat in the center of it. It could be destroyed at any moment\u2026And this vortex was actually fueled time and time again by Beyond the Heavens Sect itself. Even going as far as using its full force to help it\u2026The Lower Three Heavens stretched for trillions of miles. At its center, there were three countries. Going further out, you would be away from all the fighting.Among these three countries, the Great State of Zhao truly lived up to its name. It had the largest territory. Its national strength was enormous, its people prosperous. It was also taking steps to expand its border on all sides with dreams of uniting all under the heavens. The two other countries were Iron Cloud Nation and Limitless Nation. These two countries, despite having powerful forces, were much weaker compared to the Great State of Zhao. They were also the prey much coveted by the Great State of Zhao.Recently, boundary struggles broke out continually at the borders of the three countries. At this point, in the capital of Iron Cloud Nation, Iron Cloud City, there were four fatigued riders at the city gate. One middle-aged person, two young men and a young woman wearing a black silk mask. On their bodies, there were blood stains. They looked at each other and the middle aged person exhaled a long sigh and said, \u201cWe are finally here. Qian Qian, are you okay?\u201dHe spoke as if a heavy weight had been lifted.\u201cI am fine.\u201d Said Wu Qian Qian, her voice exposing her weariness. \u201cWe were attacked more often this time. Our whereabouts were kept secret. I don\u2019t understand what happened. Something is amiss.\u201dThis middle-aged man was the head of the ninth peak of Beyond the Heavens Sect, Stepping on the Clouds Peak, Bao Kuang Lei. Bao, this was a relatively rare surname meaning violent.Bao Kuang Lei was a bold and true character comparable to Wu Yun Liang. While he took careful measure in his work, he was not afraid to take risks. He was so meticulous in dealing with matters that not a drop of water could escape him. The name Bao did not seem to suit him.\u201cRegardless, we\u2019re finally here.\u201d Wu Qian Qian smiled.The four glanced at each other, sharing the same unspoken thoughts\u2026 There must be a spy within the sect! Moreover, the position of the spy was probably not low!\u201cLet\u2019s enter the city.\u201d Bao Kuang Lei carried a sad countenance, but it became immediately uplifted as he stretched out his arms.The group entered into the city, turning left and right, here and there for quite a while before reaching a vast official looking building with a silver plaque on top. Three golden words were carved on it Thousand Autumns Manor (TLN: Thousand autumns literally, but basically means forever). Thousand Autumns Manor was the home of the prince of Iron Cloud Nation. The royal prince of Iron Cloud Nation lives here! (TLN: yes, the author did get paid by the word.)After being announced, the four advanced into Thousand Autumns Manor. Under the guidance of a servant, they arrived at the main hall. In the middle of the hall was a luxurious chair. A youth carrying an aura like precious jade, wearing a soft, yellow outfit, was reading intently. His long brows reached his hair line. His face was like a pearl and upon his head of black hair, a crown sat prominently.At a glance, this youth looked a little thin, weak and perhaps even timid to others\u2026 But if you looked closely at the effortless way he was holding his book, then you would notice that there was an extreme stability to the pose.His face was gentle and calm, even effeminate to the point that it made people want to protect him\u2026 Once you approached this youth, there was a sense as if you were standing in front of the moon, so lofty and high beyond reach!It seemed as if power over all lives under the heavens were in those steady thin hands!After hearing the introduction by the servant, this youth put his book down and slowly lifted his head to look at the four people. His face revealed a smile, like a spring breeze that dispels the winter snow, and spoke peacefully, \u201cYou have had to travel a long journey to be my guests. Please sit down.\u201dBao Kuang Lei immediately said, \u201cThank you, your highness.\u201d Then he and the three disciples sat down on the side.This youth was the prince of Iron Cloud Nation \u2013 Tie Bu Tian.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn this moment, his eyes flashed over the four people. He suddenly smiled, his brows rose, and he said casually, \u201cIt seems you did not have a comfortable trip.\u201d\u201cYou are correct. It was full of slaughter and danger.\u201d Bao Kuang Lei answered calmly. They were people of the sect and did not belong to the court; when speaking to the prince, they did not need to bow or conduct themselves ceremoniously. However, Xue Ye Meng and Qin Mu Shang were somewhat tense.\u201cHaha\u2026 it seems that someone had secretly taken action.\u201d Tie Bu Tian smiled blandly. His eyes, like his laughter that slowly trailed off, slowly narrowed. He put his palms together and said slowly, \u201cPlease rest assured that nothing like that will happen in Iron Cloud Nation, not even once!\u201dEven though his physique was thin and frail and he was not very tall, when he put his palms together, he stood up and his cold gaze swept the horizon with the air of one who could command all under heaven! As if, just by standing up, he could bring all things to his feet.Bao Kuang Lei was shocked, he finally understood his eldest martial brother\u2019s decision. Just looking at the prince\u2019s aura when he stood up was enough to confirm that he was going to become a legendary hero!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Early tomorrow morning, I will inform my father personally. If he agrees, then we will proceed immediately.\u201d Tie Bu Tian smiled.Earlier his appearance was like a sword emitting an aura of arrogance. But after the smile, his whole demeanor suddenly became gentle and intimate, making others feel as if they were being bathed in the spring breeze.He did not need to do any tricks to sway people\u2019s hearts. His speaking naturally was enough to make all those who come into contact with him feel regret that they were not in his service.\u201cYes!\u201d Bao Kuang Lei shivered. He could not help but re-evaluate this prince at a higher level. Despite his age, he was not simple. Since his birth until now, Bao Kuang Lei had met many different kinds of people. However, he has yet to meet anyone who could compare to this prince.It was clear why people praised him as the number one heaven-sent talent of the Lower Three Heavens of all time.Before meeting Tie Bu Tian, Bao Kuang Lei did not pay attention to those praises. In life, how can there be such a thing as a heaven-sent talent. It\u2019s only good upbringing and receiving better training than normal people. If you learn to rule from infancy, over time, your aura will certainly be above normal. As for number one heaven-sent talent\u2026 there is no lack of heaven-sent talents in this world.However, at this time, he believed. From the elegance that seemed seeped to the bones to the majesty that seemed to radiate from the soul. Every action, from the lifting of the hands to the stretching of the legs, was so natural and exuded a regalness that it made a Jiang Hu person like Bao Kuang Lei tremble in his soul.****************************************************************************************************Beyond the Heavens Sect\u2019s Purple Bamboo Garden.Next morning, Tan Tan laying on the ground with arms and legs outstretched, panted and exclaimed, \u201cChu\u2026 Yang\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2026 admit you are much more handsome than me. But these past few days, you have been really cruel. You are working me to death\u2026\u201dThese days Chu Yang just wanted to cultivate, so he forced Tan Tan to go along with him, making him practically die from exhaustion. Therefore, only after a few days, every time Tan Tan saw Chu Yang, he would shake uncontrollably from fear.With every session, Chu Yang calculated very carefully. He knew exactly how long it would take before Tan Tan\u2019s body reached its extreme limits. So after each time, even though Tan Tan could barely stand up, his body was not in any danger.Every time Tan Tan saw Chu Yang, it was as if he had run into a demon. Previously, he was in the habit of bragging and self-admiration, but currently he didn\u2019t even have time for self-admiration.Chu Yang took a deep breath, pulled in his energy and stood up. In the past twenty days, he did not let his cultivation lapse for even a little. His cultivation has already reached ninth grade martial pupil, just a little more and he would enter the rank of martial warrior.Feeling all the transformations inside him, Chu Yang smiled. Only when he advanced to the rank of martial warrior could he begin to officially train his body.If his strength had not reached martial warrior level and he forcefully practiced excessive physical exercises, then his muscles and internal organs would be severely compromised. There was a saying in the Lower Three Heavens,\u201cLiterature lasts for eternity,Martial artist retires at death.\u201dThis implied that those who practice martial arts usually do not live past 60 years. However, this lesson seemed to be not right. Because while this saying basically valued literature over martial arts, the number 60 was just a haphazard guess. The truth was, every year, there were countless martial pupils who wanted to improve their skills by cultivating carelessly. But this ends up consuming a lot of their strength and results in extreme fatigue that was unbearable to the body of a martial pupil. Even if they advance in skill, that fatigue was permanent in their body. When they are about 50 years old, this fatigue will manifest itself intensively and it would be too late to do anything because the body would be ravaged beyond repair.Therefore, martial artists always wasted the most time in the training the body, setting a solid foundation at this martial pupil level.Just a little bit more and he would become a martial warrior, then he will have the requirements to cultivate Nine Tribulations Sword \u2013 Nine Tribulations Transcending the Nine Heavens Technique! And not just Nine Tribulations Sword, but there were techniques in the Middle Three Heavens that clearly stated those below the rank of martial warrior cannot cultivate.Chu Yang\u2019s dantian stirred. He had struggled from dawn to noon to cultivate a little qi for the Nine Tribulations Sword spirit to absorb. A moment later, it released that qi. Even though the amount of qi was much smaller, it was extremely pure.Although, this qi could not compare to natural qi, but in terms of purity it was many times better. When compared to the normally absorbed qi, the difference was heaven and earth. It was much better.These days, after each cultivation, as his martial power increased, Chu Yang felt the sword spirit stir quietly inside of him. He thought nothing of it, and gradually ignored it all together.What worried him most during this time was the pure purple jade essence around his neck, which was unreactive. When it came to this pure purple jade essence, Chu Yang could not find a solution. The first time he had wanted to use this pure purple jade essence to restore his energy, before he could, the Nine Tribulations sword spirit suddenly became disturbed from inside his dantian and cut off contact completely. Chu Yang tried again a few times but to no avail. It was obvious that the Nine Tribulations sword spirit wanted him to rely on his own strength to cultivate, not any external sources.Even when he used the jade to recover energy to fight against a rival, it didn\u2019t matter to Nine Tribulations sword spirit, it still wouldn\u2019t let him. Before, he was able to use the jade essence once, in coping with Qu Ping. At that time, the Nine Tribulations Sword Spirit had no reaction, but since that battle, it would not let him do it again.Encountering an impartial monitor like this, Chu Yang had no choice but to oblige. Eventually he extinguished any intention of using the pure purple jade essence during cultivation.Tilting his head, Chu Yang looked at struggling form of Tan Tan. He almost laughed. He said, \u201cOkay, you can rest a little.\u201dHearing these words, Tan Tan felt as if he was given a privilege. He was so grateful he almost shed tears. He got up with some difficulty. His arms and legs looked as if there were trying to crawl. When he finally got up, he let out a sigh of relief.In the yard, Chu Yang continued to practice the simple action of drawing and sheathing the sword. Even though this was extremely boring, he was attentive to every little action and tried hard until every action was skillfully trained.At this time, from the east, the sun had slowly shown itself, making Chu Yang\u2019s whole body heat up. Drops of sweat constantly fell down, soaking the ground.When Tan Tan finally recovered, he turned to look at Chu Yang practicing. When Tan Tan saw Chu Yang\u2019s movements, he slowly noticed a strange point. Even though Chu Yang repeated the same actions hundreds of times, each time Chu Yang\u2019s movement had a tiny difference!It seemed that Chu Yang was continuously adjusting. From the beginning, where his actions seemed a little unnatural, to later when they became more fluid and finally they seemed to have become a flash of light.Drawing the sword, sheathing the sword, he continued like that until the sound become softer and softer each time. Although it was not obvious, the sounds truly became slightly softer each time.\u201cChu Yang, your arm is swollen!\u201d Tan Tan was looking at Chu Yang practicing and admiring him, when he suddenly discovered that between Chu Yang\u2019s elbow and shoulder, there was an abnormal swollen mass. He shouted out in panic.However, Chu Yang\u2019s countenance remained unconcerned as if nothing has happened and his movement did not stop. He said indifferently, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It will go away with more training. If I stop now and wait for it go down, then it would take a long time. The best way is to practice until you get used to it. Then this swelling will go away on its own. That\u2019s how you can advance!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Chu Yang\u2019s words made Tan Tan feel ashamed. He could only stand there stupefied. Then seeing that he had restored some energy, he immediately resumed practice.In a corner of Purple Bamboo Forest, Meng Chao Ran was quietly watching the two practice. The edge of his mouth revealed a little smile.Meanwhile, a constant moan could be heard from inside. It was the sound of Shi Qian Shan tormented by pain. He had been bed-ridden for the past 20 days. Qu Ping\u2019s people were cruel; that day they had broken Shi Qian Shan\u2019s ribs and femur.At least for the next three months, Shi Qian Shan would not be able to practice. And in the next half year, he would not be able to use his martial arts. But ranking competition for disciples of Beyond the Heavens Sect will probably be done by then. This injury will undoubtedly destroy all of Shi Qian Shan\u2019s plans at Beyond the Heavens Sect!The physical pain did not compare to the mental anguish that Shi Qian Shan felt. But the bizarre thing is, he did not hate the people who hurt him, he hated Chu Yang. In Shi Qian Shan\u2019s mind, if it were not for Chu Yang, he would have had a bright future!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

All the misery he currently suffered was single-handedly caused by Chu Yang. During this period, Chu Yang \u2018meticulously\u2019 took care of Shi Qian Shan, checking on him once a day.\u201cEldest Martial Brother, how are you? Today, I have advanced beyond fifth grade martial pupil.\u201d\u201cEldest Martial Brother! Today, I had broken past the sixth grade.\u201d\u201cI have achieved seventh grade\u2026!\u201dEvery \u2018good news\u2019 made Shi Qian Shan felt as if he was being pierced by a thousand arrows. He became very upset making his recovery very slow; it even worsened.However, the thing that Shi Qian Shan should not have done was let his hatred for Chu Yang spread to Meng Chao Ran and Tan Tan as well. This hatred was seeped to the bones! How could Chu Yang have advanced so fast? It certainly must have been a favor from Meng Chao Ran. The master must have had some sort of elixir to speed up cultivation! I have been with him for so many years and he didn\u2019t give it to me. Instead he gave it to Chu Yang!That must be it! The hatred in Shi Qian Shan\u2019s heart gradually grew more severe, until it became immeasurable.In the days that followed, even though his attitude was indifferent, Meng Chao Ran took a lot of care with Shi Qian Shan. He did not hesitate to waste his energy to heal Shi Qian Shan\u2019s meridians as well as help reduce his pain. Furthermore, he spared no effort in searching for medicine to help Shi Qian Shan recover\u2026However, Shi Qian Shan has allowed his hatred to cloud his judgment. He went as far as grinding his teeth with the master who had given him so much.So\u2026 Shi Qian Shan wanted revenge!Outside of Shi Qian Shan\u2019s room, there was a small pond, approximately the size of half a room and deeper than a meter. Water flowing from the peak go through here before continuing downward making a winding stream through the mountains.The water in this pond was so clear, you could see the bottom. Everyday Chu Yang and the others drank water from here.Currently Shi Qian Shan was trying to get up from his bed. He then stealthily took out a paper parcel from under his bed. This was \u2018Before Dawn Soul Scattering Powder\u2019. This was mixture of five highly toxic poisons, without color or taste. But mostly important, without antidote! When mixed with food, they become a wonderful tasting additive that stimulates your appetite.Shi Qian Shan\u2019s lips were trembling and even his fingers were shaking. However, he remained steadfast in his resolve. He reached for the candle next to his bed. With his right hand he broke off part of the candle\u2026His face seemed alternate between red and white, as if his heart was under a lot of conflict. However, his hands did not stop. He emptied the entire parcel of poison into a newly formed wax pellet.Afterwards, he hid everything under the blanket.If I am like this, you people shall not live well either! Anyway, I am so heavily wounded, even if everyone here was dead, no one would suspect me!If Purple Bamboo Garden has only me left, then the Sect Master would surely show some preferential treatment! That way I would still have a chance. Even if I can no longer lean on Meng Chao Ran, I can still succeed.Die! You can all die!At this point, Shi Qian Shan had apparently entered a state of frenzy.The sun slowly rose to its peak, Shi Qian Shan listened, then clenched his teeth\u2026 A small container flew straight outside from his hand.Plop! It dropped into the pond.Shi Qian Shan breathed a sigh of relief. He slumped in his bed. There was a look of anxiousness as well as shame in his eyes. But immediately after, he became crazed. He gritted his teeth, his hands gripped tightly onto the blanket, tearing a hole in it. disquietA moment later, he finally relaxed. A smile appeared on his mouth revealing pleasure and satisfaction.The water in the pond flowed constantly, if the poison was released directly, then its effect would fade. However, if it were placed in a wax container, it would release more slowing.Based on the daily meal time, this moment was perfect. He calculated the time carefully. After about a second, there was a creaky sound. It was the sound of the two wooden buckets that Tan Tan used to carry water. Shi Qian Shan immediately went back under his blanket, closed his eyes and moaned\u2026After a while, the clacking sound of pots and pans were heard, followed by Tan Tan\u2019s monstrous singing. Finally, the fragrant smell food arose.Shi Qian Shan smiled evilly.****************************************************************************************************The three, Meng Chao Ran, Tan Tan, and Chu Yang, sat around the dining table looking at aromatic food. Tan Tan\u2019s puppy dog eyes was currently looking at his master, but his stomach was growling. He was waiting for Meng Chao Ran to open his mouth, then he would attack the food.However, when Meng Chao Ran looked at the food, he frowned. The food today did not seem like normal. The smell was much stronger, almost\u2026 excessively fragrant.There was something strange!He felt that something was not right.Meng Chao Ran was in deep thought; he picked up his chopsticks, just to put them down again. He tilted his head and looked over at Chu Yang. It seemed that Chu Yang was also staring at the food on the table and thinking about something.Meng Chao Ran was surprised. The reason he found the food strange was due to his decades of experience in Jiang Hu in addition to his careful personality and heightened senses borne from countless dangerous encounters. If it were normal people, then they would not have noticed any anomalies in the fragrant smell of the food. It\u2019s likely that they would want to eat it even more.But how could Chu Yang realize this? He was only 16 years old. Moreover, he had never been outside of the sect. How could he have such keen perception?\u201cTan Tan, did you make this food?\u201d Chu Yang calmly smiled and asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right, let\u2019s eat everyone. It smells so good\u2026 I can\u2019t wait any longer.\u201d Tan Tan begged pitifully.Chu Yang seemed to have figured out something as he looked at the rippling water in the small pond outside. With a flick of his wrist, there appeared a small black jade pin in his hand. He poked it into a soup dish on the table.It immediately changed to a frightful purple blue color. Tan Tan\u2019s color changed immediately, he almost screamed out loud. As if he already knew Tan Tan\u2019s reaction without even looking at him, Chu Yang covered Tan Tan\u2019s mouth with his hand. His gaze did not leave from the food on the table. He said in a serious voice, \u201cTan Tan is not capable of poisoning us. The problem is in the pond water!\u201dMeng Chao Ran was shocked, because he also just thought of the same thing. Tan Tan was the cook but he was not the poisoner. After all, he took care of Tan Tan since he was little. Tan Tan never had any exposure with poisons. How could he have done it?Meng Chao Ran took a deep breath. Suddenly, there was anger in his face as he turned his head and looked straight at Shi Qian Shan\u2019s room.\u201cLet me go!\u201d Chu Yang said quietly.\u201cYou? What do you plan to do?\u201d Meng Chao Ran\u2019s countenance was unsightly.\u201cBasically, I plan to satisfy him,\u201d Chu Yang said casually.Meng Chao Ran\u2019s eyes narrowed. With a slight laugh, he said, \u201cIn that case, you should go then.\u201dAfter a pause, he continued, \u201cDon\u2019t say too much. Let him have a chance to explain himself. It\u2019s possible he doesn\u2019t know the extent of his actions.\u201dHis voice was very soft, but within it, there was bitterness and fatigue. No matter what, Shi Qian Shan was still his disciple for the past 7-8 years! Chu Yang wanted to help him handle this matter because he understood Meng Chao Ran\u2019s dilemma.Meng Chao Ran was currently furious. But inversely, Chu Yang completely understood him and felt very happy.Chu Yang nodded. He carried the tray of food that was previously prepared for Shi Qian Shan. When he arrived in front of Shi Qian Shan\u2019s room, he smiled slightly and said, \u201cEldest Martial Brother, it\u2019s time to eat!\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t Tan Tan always bring my food? Why is it you today?\u201d Shi Qian Shan asked, looking suspiciously at Chu Yang.\u201cThat Tan Tan is so tired today, he couldn\u2019t even get up.\u201d Chu Yang smiled warmly and said. \u201cWe are all brothers; Tan Tan or me, what difference does it make? You have helped us so much with such deep love and care. I thought I should at least do something to repay you.\u201dShi Qian Shan answered in agreement, \u201cHm. My appetite is not so good today, I don\u2019t want to eat. Just leave it right there.\u201dWhat a joke! He clearly knew there was poison in the food. It was his own doing! How would he dare eat it?Outside, Meng Chao Ran was concentrating all his energy to listen to everything being said in that room. When he heard Shi Qian Shan saying that, he could not help but snort. He still could not imagine that his disciple of 7-8 years now wanted to kill him. Even though everything was already clear, he still told Chu Yang to give Shi Qian Shan a chance to explain himself.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euStill holding onto a ray of hope.However, after hearing Shi Qian Shan, he has lost all hope.With a big grin, Chu Yang asked, \u201cHow could you not eat? The body is iron and rice is steel (TLN: another saying, people can\u2019t function on an empty stomach). Plus you are wounded, you need nutrition to recover quickly. Eldest Martial Brother, you must eat at least a little bit! If you finish the whole thing, I am sure you would feel better.\u201dShi Qian Shan frowned and said in a disgusted tone, \u201cI already told you, I won\u2019t eat! Just get out!\u201d\u201cWhy not\u2026 is there poison in there?\u201d Chu Yang said sincerely, \u201cEldest Martial Brother, we have been brothers for many years. Is it possible that you believe that I would poison you? Hurry up and eat!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Chu Yang\u2019s words were aimed directly at him. He immediately lifted his head and looked at Chu Yang. He asked in a serious voice, \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d\u201cI am trying to tell you to eat. After that, you will understand!\u201d Chu Yang looked at him, his gaze slowly turned cold. He continued slowly, \u201cI wanted to see if the poison in the food can kill or not. Honestly, I am very curious about that!\u201dShi Qian Shan\u2019s heart suddenly sank. \u201cYou\u2026 What kind of joke is this?\u201dChu Yang smirked. \u201cWhat? You\u2019re not having any fun with this game? Shall we move onto a new game then?\u201dChu Yang immediately took a bowl of rice to the bed and sat down on Shi Qian Shan\u2019s legs. A crack was heard as the healing bones broke once again. Shi Qian Shan screamed in pain as his body contorted like a shrimp. Sweat drops the size of soy beans streamed down his face. The moment his mouth opened, Chu Yang stuffed it with a bit of the blanket. Chu Yang\u2019s action was agile and decisive. Someone with many decades of experience could not have carried out an action so fluidly.Shi Qian\u2019s anguished screams immediately turned into smothered chokes, with no way of coming out. He could do nothing except stare at Chu Yang fearfully and shake his head repeatedly. At this time, sweat was pouring like rain from all over Shi Qian Shan\u2019s body. With one hand holding the rice bowl, Chu Yang clucked Shi Qian Shan\u2019s neck with the other. He looked coldly at Shi Qian Shan and said, \u201cShi Qian Shan, I didn\u2019t want to kill you so early, I had hardly vented enough. However, today, your actions have pushed me beyond my limits.\u201dWith his mouth muzzled, no matter how Shi Qian Shan tried to yell and scream, he could only emit a few throaty \u2018oh\u2019 \u2018oh\u2019. His eyes were filled with resentment and fear. He tried to struggle in a last ditch effort, rendering himself even more pained due to his wounds.\u201cShi Qian Shan, the way you treated Tan Tan and I these past years. Let\u2019s not even mention that now. Eight years ago, your family was robbed by bandits, their lives were hanging by a thread, and your sister was almost assaulted by them. It was master who appeared in time to save your family. Afterward, it was your family who begged master to take you as a disciple. Master thought you seemed like a decent person and took you in and taught you martial arts. But now, not only do you not appreciate his kindness, you dare to use poison to try to kill him. Are you even human?\u201dChu Yang reprimanded, \u201cYou are indeed \u2018wolf\u2019s heart and dog\u2019s lung\u2019!\u201dThere was shame in Shi Qian Shan\u2019s eyes, but it disappeared immediately. He violently looked at Chu Yang as if wanting to eat him alive. Of course, there was no repentance at all!Suddenly Shi Qian Shan let out a dry cough. A clump of fresh blood flew out from his mouth. The force was so strong that the bit of blanket stuffed in his mouth came out as well.The fresh blood splashed on the blanket forming patchy streaks. Shi Qian Shan did not make a sound from the suffering, instead his eyes glared at Chu Yang. \u201cChu Yang! Don\u2019t pretend in front of me. It\u2019s useless! Those little tricks, I stopped using them a long time ago.\u201dShi Qian Shan had another dry cough and despite the fact that blood was continually running from the edge of his mouth, he said resentfully, \u201cI am an ingrate, so what? I wanted to kill you all, so what? I have a burning ambition, wolf\u2019s heart and dog\u2019s lungs, so what?\u201dShi Qian Shan panted, his chest heaving. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you, then I wouldn\u2019t have been beaten to the brink of death. If my legs were not broken, then I would not lose a chance to participate in the sect\u2019s ranking competition. If I did not lose that chance then my future would not be so dark. Everything is because of you! Chu Yang\u2026 you and I will not share the same sky! As for master\u2026 hahaha\u2026\u201dShi Qian Shan wiped the dried blood from the corner of his mouth and let out a cold laugh. \u201cYou think Meng Chao Ran is really that kind? Why did he save my family that year? Was it not because he was mesmerized by my sister\u2019s beauty? If I did not discover in time and immediately married her off to somebody else, then she would have fallen into his hands. Normally he acts as if he is honorable, but on the inside, he is a scoundrel. Sometimes, at night, he keeps called, Chu Chu\u2026 Chu Chu\u2026 He thought I couldn\u2019t hear? Chu Chu is my sister\u2019s nickname! He is truly a scoundrel.\u201dIt seemed that Shi Qian Shan knew that after what he did today, he could hardly escape death. So he brought out all the resentment that was in his heart.In the dining room next door, after hearing these words, Meng Chao Ran\u2019s whole body trembled. His face gradually grew pale.Crack!The teacup in Meng Chao Ran\u2019s hand shattered. The little broken pieces dropped down from the cracks of his fingers. Suddenly, Meng Chao Ran\u2019s hair stood on end. He let out a single breath, which flew towards the door and surprisingly created a big hole.\u201cHahaha, I got it right then? This old man\u2026 what greatness, what generosity\u2026 hahaha\u2026\u201d Shi Qian Shan laughed insanely.Chu Yang roared loudly and rushed forward to attack Shi Qian Shan.Pow! (walkthejianghu.com)Before Chu Yang\u2019s palm was even lowered, the wall separating the two rooms broke, scattering dust everywhere. Meng Chao Ran rushed into the room and grabbed Chu Yang\u2019s wrist. Knowing that Chu Yang would not be able to control himself, he took this direct action.\u201cOld man, you wanted to say something else?\u201d When Shi Qian Shan saw Meng Chao Ran, his body cringed instinctively. Only his talk sounded aggressive.Meng Chao Ran slowly let go of Chu Yang. He took a few breaths and quickly recovered. His eyes looked at Shi Qian Shan without sympathy. He said slowly, \u201cShi Qian Shan, from this moment, you are expelled from the sect!\u201dShi Qian Shan laughed loudly. \u201cOh, Meng Chao Ran, Meng Chao Ran. You think at this point I still need to be your disciple? I spit on it!\u201dMeng Chao Ran\u2019s gaze became colder, but he continued to speak calmly, \u201cShi Qian Shan, your sister was quite pretty, but not to the point where I, Meng Chao Ran, would remember forever.\u201dWith a laugh, Shi Qian Shan mocked, \u201cThen why did you call my sister\u2019s name in your sleep? Are you crazy?\u201dMeng Chao Ran\u2019s eyes flashed with anger, but that anger was immediately replaced with pity. \u201cThat was not your sister name. I am 48 this year. Eight years ago I was 40, your sister was only 15. Even though she was not bad looking, I, Meng Chao Ran, would never stoop that low.\u201dMeng Chao Ran laughed dryly, \u201cI did call Chu Chu\u2026 not your Chu Chu; Chu Chu\u2026 Ye Chu Chen, that was my love, my wife. We have been separated for 20 years now. There\u2019s never been a moment when I don\u2019t think about her\u2026\u201dMeng Chao Ran said coldly, \u201cActually, the reason I saved your family that year, was because her name and your sister\u2019s name sounded the same. Otherwise, Jiang Hu was full of the strong bullying the weak. I, Meng Chao Ran, was never interested in interfering in the affairs of others!\u201dMeng Chao Ran\u2019s words made Shi Qian Shan choke; he was speechless. In this moment, everything became clear. No wonder the master\u2019s voice became strange every time he mentioned that name. So\u2026 so\u2026 it was not his sister\u2019s name\u2026Suddenly, Shi Qian Shan felt very sorry. He went through many years untrusting and embracing hatred, but as it turned out, it was all a misunderstanding\u2026Meng Chao Ran took a deep breath and said casually, \u201cThe reason I am telling you everything is not for your sake! Let\u2019s just call this my farewell to you.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMeng Chao Ran\u2019s words seemed contradictory, but Chu Yang, who stood on the side, understood. This was Meng Chao Ran explaining to Chu Yang. He did not want his disciple to misunderstand him. Nor did want others to misunderstand the precious love in his heart, because of this, he needed someone to be a witness.So many years have gone by, but nothing could sway the love that was in Meng Chao Ran\u2019s heart.This time, Shi Qian Shan had awakened the Meng Chao Ran\u2019s deepest suffering!Shi Qian Shan\u2019s countenance shifted, he cried out, \u201cMaster\u2026. I was wrong\u2026 I was confused\u2026 I deserve to die\u2026 please, please forgive me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too late! In this life, there are some mistakes you should not make. And if you make them, then you will have to pay with your life.\u201d Meng Chao Ran shook his head coldly and slowly stretched out a hand. His gaze was calm and resolute. He ignored Shi Qian Shan\u2019s pleas for forgiveness; he was determined to eliminate any future problems.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He palmed Shi Qian Shan in the chest. Only a pow was heard and the bones around Shi Qian Shan\u2019s chest shattered into pieces. His body jerked up, his eyes widened, and blood foamed from his ears, nose and mouth. In a few breaths, his body went limp and he stopped breathing.\u201cAh?\u201d Meng Chao Ran looked at Chu Yang, he immediately understood Chu Yang\u2019s intention and let out a sigh.\u201cMaster, it was better for me to do it. He has bullied us for years, this was a chance for me to vent my anger.\u201d Chu Yang said calmly.Meng Chao Ran took a looked thoughtfully at him and patted him on the shoulder. He wanted to say something to Chu Yang, but in the end, he just quietly walked out.With Meng Chao Ran\u2019s personality, if he had to kill a disciple he raised for eight years by his own hand then he would be plagued by it forever. However, if it was by Chu Yang\u2019s hand, then, even though Shi Qian Shan still died in front of him, it was still not by his own hand and he would be less burdened.Chu Yang\u2019s intentions, how could Meng Chao Ran not know?Chu Yang sighed. He looked at Shi Qian Shan, unable to hold back his resentments, he said: \u201cDying so easily\u2026 that was too comfortable for you.\u201dThese words were not exaggerated. If Meng Chao Ran had not suddenly come in, then Chu Yang\u2019s tactics in combination with the hatred accumulated from two lifetimes would certainly have made Shi Qian Shan no longer want to live.Chu Yang finally understood why Meng Chao Ran named him so. First, because of the word \u2018Chu\u2019 from that jade pendant. Second, because of the word \u2018Chu\u2019 from Ye Chu Chen.Chu Yang, did it not sound the sun\u2019s early morning light?\u2018Chu Chen\u2019 did that not have a similar meaning as well?The \u2018Tan\u2019 in Tan Tan, did it not carry the meaning of fleeting beauty? (TLN: it was actually a whole phrase referencing a flower called Tan Hua or Queen of the Night , which blooms rarely and only at night)Was this not Meng Chao Ran expressing his lamentation for his short-lived love?Chu Yang suddenly understood the immense suffering that his master carried in his heart. For people, the most difficult things to deal with are separation in life and parting in death. The words \u2018separation in life\u2019 were first, because compared to \u2018parting in death\u2019, it was much more difficult.\u2018Parting in death\u2019 was only temporary discomfort, but in living, one was tormented for life. A person only had to be alive for the pain to become engraved deep inside and to be tortured without end!\u201cYe Chu Chen\u2026\u201d Chu Yang quietly noted. Staring in Meng Chao Ran\u2019s direction, he thought, \u201cMaster, I will remember this name.\u201dLooking back at Shi Qian Shan corpse with his eyes rolled back, after a long silence, conflicting emotions emerged in Chu Yang. He finally came to a realization: he, himself, have transformed the lives of others!In the previous life, Shi Qian Shan would have lived for another four years. However, after no more than a month in this second life, he has died by Chu Yang\u2019s hands\u2026After a moment of silence, Chu Yang covered the body with a blanket and leisurely carried it outside. When everything was taken care of, Chu Yang discovered something surprising. During the course of this event, Tan Tan had prepared another the meal and had set it out on the table, still steaming hot.Even more surprising was the fact that Meng Chao Ran, instead of disappearing, was quietly sitting at the table as if waiting for Chu Yang. Everything was just like any other day.As Chu Yang entered, Tan Tan asked shakily, \u201cThat\u2026 eldest martial brother\u2026 ah, Shi Qian Shan\u2026?\u201d\u201cHe died. I killed him.\u201dChu Yang said calmly then sat down. With a nod, Tan Tan kept his head down and suddenly losing his appetite. When he heard the things Shi Qian Shan said earlier, he thought death was not enough for him. However, he now still felt an inexplicable feeling of loss. Regardless of everything, they still lived together for many years. Plus, until today, Tan Tan did not discover Shi Qian Shan\u2019s true nature.With a serious face, Meng Chao Ran picked up his chopsticks and said, \u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201d His gaze was calm as if the earlier event never occurred and Purple Bamboo Garden never had a disciple named Shi Qian Shan.The three were quiet. The air around them was heavy with tension nearing breaking point.Chu Yang did not add anything else. Meng Chao Ran did not need any consolation. Even though he did feel some regrets, it was not something he cannot get over in a couple of days. The only thing was, before dying, Shi Qian Shan spoke those words that renewed the pain deep inside Meng Chao Ran\u2019s heart. This pain will probably continue to torment him for a long time\u2026When Meng Chao Ran was done eating, he saw that Chu Yang was eating voraciously. He could not help but grinned and said, \u201cChu Yan, was this really the first time you killed someone? As I recalled, you have not even killed a chicken before.\u201dStupefied, Chu Yang answered, \u201cYes\u2026!\u201d At this moment, he realized that he was too calm after killing someone. In the eyes of an experience person like Meng Chao Ran this extraordinary reaction was questionable.Whether it was a martial artist or an evil person with countless crimes, after killing for the first time, there should be a reaction of some sort. Yet Chu Yang has just killed a person for the first time, his eldest martial brother of eight years, and he could still eat well as if nothing has happened\u2026!How could this not unnerve others?\u201cYour mind is extremely fortified. It\u2019s as if you are a natural born killer.\u201dMeng Chao Ran smiled as he talked. Suddenly he remember Wu Yun Liang\u2019s proposal. He realized sending Chu Yang on that dangerous mission might not be so unreasonable.This calmness was to the point of extreme. If he were sent on the mission, he would absolutely not reveal any flaws. Only, Meng Chao Ran was still worried about his disciple so his thoughts were conflicted.This would be an opportunity or it could be a perilous path! (TLN: Chinese saying again \u2013 nine deaths, one life)\u201cNatural born killer\u2026\u201d Chu Yang laughed inwardly. He thought to himself: Even though it was my first time in this life, in my previous life, I have sent thousands of souls to rest. Can it really still be considered a cold-blooded reaction? My heart was dead a long time ago. Killing a man, strangely enough, was no different than killing a chicken\u2026\u201cEven with death, Shi Qian Shan did not pay for all his sins. Disciple killed him was simply a matter doling out justice. There was no pressure or reservation; plus it was my pleasure.\u201d Chu Yang answered.Meng Chao Ran looked at him and suddenly smiled. He simply said, \u201cVery good!\u201dIn the blink of an eye, three days have passed!That night, Chu Yang was sitting alone in the depths of Purple Bamboo Forest, feeling the energy of heaven and earth. He had a feeling that today would be the day he would have a breakthrough in his cultivation and enter into the level of Martial Warrior!Since the day he killed Shi Qian Shan, a violent force buried deep inside him had awakened. Chu Yang also felt a frightening aura fluctuate wildly in his dantian. As if a bloodthirsty emotion had awaken and was struggling and howling from inside him.This was the cruelty ingrained in his soul from practicing sword arts without love in his previous life. Chu Yang spent a lot of effort suppressing this emotion in order to continue to cultivate peacefully. Just then, an energy inside him suddenly surged up as if trying to breakout from some invisible shackles!Chu Yang eyes narrowed as he manipulated the vortex of energy with special attention to his dantian. At this point the little Nine Tribulation Sword Spirit seemed to become the center of everything. The vortex from his dantian swirled around the Nine Tribulation Sword Spirit nine times and, like lightning, shot straight into the meridians. Like a massive force of nature, it flooded throughout his meridian channels!Gradually growing powerful, the energy swirled around his meridians nine times and became a powerful wave. Chu Yang\u2019s concentration was disturbed as this wave pushed past the level of Martial Pupil and aggressively advanced into the level of Martial Warrior!Boom!Chu Yang could only hear an exploding sound from inside him like thunder. His whole body shook violently, and suddenly fresh crimson blood shot out from his mouth and nostrils.At this time the vast energy had risen up and broke through his barriers, flooding into new meridian channels. Chu Yang was meticulous in controlling his energy flow, because after a breakthrough, using new meridian channels can lead to injuries if not carefully done. These injuries would be the invisible force that limited a martial art practitioner\u2019s achievements in the future.He was being careful as if crossing a bridge made of a single log. After leading his energy around the meridian channels one time, Chu Yang was soaked in sweat. However, he did not falter and continued applying all his efforts.One round, two rounds\u2026 nine rounds were completed!After the cycle was done, Chu Yang let out a powerful breath. He felt as if he has less than half his strength. Then, a relaxed feeling came over him like he was immersed in warm water.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euChu Yang spit out a dark mass. Even in the night, it flashed a bright black light and then dissipated into thin air.In a hidden place in Purple Bamboo Forest, Meng Chao Ran stood erect. His whole body was covered in the night\u2019s dew, he was attentively watching over his disciple.At the moment Chu Yang succeeded, Meng Chao Ran also let out a sigh of relief. Chu Yang has just gained another step in his cultivation path.\u201cMeridian purification!?\u201dMeng Chao Ran was flabbergasted when he saw Chu Yang spit out that demonic dark mass.

Anyone capable of doing what Chu Yang did was extraordinary. Meng Chao Ran was one who wouldn\u2019t blink even if the sky fell down, so there was no precedence for such an occurrence at Beyond the Heaven Sect!If Wu Yun Liang\u2019s people knew about this, their eyeballs would have popped out of their sockets and fled!Normally, a little impurity from the body was pushed out during the breakthrough into Martial Warrior. This process was called Body Transformation. In principle, impurities from the periphery of the body are pushed out slowly with the gradual cultivation through the nine grades of Martial Warrior.The one after that was at the level of Martial Master. The Martial Master breakthrough was also the same with step by step process of getting rid of impurities from the body and getting the body ready for the cultivation path ahead. The impurities purged by a Martial Master were from the five organs in the body. This process was called Internal Transformation.After that, there was the Martial Great Master breakthrough. The impurities expelled during this stage were from the meridians. This was when a person truly began to walk on the path of cultivation. This process of getting rid of impurities was called Meridian Purification.Beyond that was the realm of Revered Martial Artist. When cultivating, the body could expel impurities from the deepest places inside the body \u2013 the impurities from within marrow of the body that were detrimental to cultivation. This was called Marrow Purification. Marrow Purification was the last step in the process of training the body!Currently, Chu Yang had only broken through Martial Warrior level and he could already perform Meridian Purification! It would be strange if Meng Chao Ran was not terrified!It should be noted that Meng Chao Ran was currently only capable of Meridian Purification as well!Chu Yang breathed a sigh of relief; he had finally broken through Martial Warrior level! In other words, now he just needed to get the first piece of the Nine Tribulation Sword, then he could immediately cultivate Nine Tribulations Transcending the Nine Heavens Technique!Meng Chao Ran was surprised, but Chu Yang was not. Every early morning, when he was steadfastly practicing the same movements, he never ceased to eliminate impurities from his body. The impurities external as well as internal of his body was virtually eliminated in the morning mist.It was the mystery of Nine Tribulation Sword, targeting the mysterious points of the human body. Even simple actions can cause the entire body, from inside to out, to move. Moreover, it simultaneously multiplied the pressure that pushed impurities out by several folds.Just one simple movement that seemed so simple at first glance have become an invaluable tool; it can be even considered priceless in the martial art world!Chu Yang stood up, his feet planted firm on the ground, his upper bent slowly backward. His waist seemed to have broken as his body bent backwards and his head went between his two legs. After that his arms gripped tightly around his legs; his body forming a circle. With a bit of force, his whole body suddenly shot up like a ball, spinning in midair. (TLN: This \u2018extreme yoga\u2019 may be hard to imagine, so I drew a picture.)Meng Chao Ran observed that although Chu Yan was constantly moving in midair, every part of his body was capable of producing a different action. From his head to the tip of his toes simultaneously produce rattling sounds from the joints again and again.Meng Chao Ran was startled. Even though he did not know the efficacy of this action, he knew that it was extremely difficult and if he were to try it, he would not be able to do it at first try!Chu Yang spun in midair seven or eight times before descending and rolling on the ground. After that, he suddenly stretched like a chick just hatched from an egg. The noise made by his joints became overwhelming. Then he slowly stood up; his whole body was wobbly like a toddler just learning how to walk for the first time. His two erect legs were trembling as if holding up a heavy load. With each shake a clear sound echoed throughout the misty forest. In the end, Chu Yang whole body was erect and steadied. The sounds his joints made became lessened. His two arms followed a bizarre motion and started to swing. Once again, the sound of joints rattling started to emit from his arms!\u201cClack\u2026 clack\u2026 clack\u2026\u201dMeng Chao Ran was stupefied. He vaguely understood the implications of these actions. However, such understanding only made him more terrified!The movements, unbelievably, were part of the Life Convergence Technique!Each movement seemed extremely bizarre and inexplicable, but full of hints of the major sects!From nothing to existence, to egg, to maturity, to hatching, to flying up\u2026This was the Life Convergence of Birds! (TLN: so a bird imitation technique of some sort)After finishing these four movements, Chu Yang stopped.This was also one of the underlying set of movements of Nine Tribulation Sword. It can only be cultivated after entering the level of Martial Warrior. If one were to cultivate it at the Martial Pupil level then it is likely that the body and bones would be crushed to pieces.The suffering that one undergoes while practicing these movements were similar to having their bones pulled out. Moreover, this pain that seeps right to the bone was constant. Yet, from the beginning to end, Chu Yang did not even make a sound.By speaking, he would release out a lot of vital energy. Then the effectiveness of these movements would then be reduced by a great amount.Soon after his rebirth, Chu Yang was determined to do each task the best way possible!When everything was done, Chu Yang stretched and took a deep breath. His whole body started sweating intensely. It could be seen that the ground he stood on was quickly becoming soaked.\u201cMaster, these four movements are known as \u2018Way of Infinite Universe.\u2019 There are many mysteries within it. This disciple can only do it poorly like this. Please let me know where the errors were!\u201dChu Yang said casually without needing to turn around. He knew that his master would certainly come to watch over his breakthrough. Even though he could not sense him, he was sure that Meng Chao Ran would be around. He had learned this in the next four years of his previous life. Each time one of the three disciples had a breakthrough, Meng Chao Ran acted aloof on the exterior but was truly more worried than the disciples themselves! Each time, the master was completely dedicated to silently watching and guarding over the three.For them, when it was time for a breakthrough, all they had to do was try hard. They did not know that the master was secretly distressed for many days.Meng Chao Ran would never say anything; he only took action. In the previous life, by the time Chu Yang realized his master\u2019s pain and efforts, it was too late.In this life, how could he ignore it as if he did not know?Meng Chao Ran laughed loudly and walked out from within Purple Bamboo Forest. He asked, \u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201dChu Yang smiled, his eyes full of affection. He said, \u201cEach time one of us has a breakthrough, where did you go? When we cultivate, we were never disturbed. When we have a breakthrough, our surroundings were extremely peaceful. There was not even a bug, let alone rodent, snakes\u2026 Something like that inside Purple Bamboo Forest, how could it not be surprising?\u201dMeng Chao Ran smiled happily, \u201cIt was your effort. The breakthrough was from your own abilities. This master only silently watched.\u201dMeng Chao Ran did not say it, but he was touched. He knew those movements was done intentionally for him to see so he could cultivate and enhance his self-defense capability. A set of movements like this was extremely useful in the path of cultivation. Meng Chao Ran did not say anything further, but simply noted this silently.This set of movements was a treasure. He simply did not know where Chu Yang learned it from\u2026 regardless, Meng Chao Ran did not ask. Everyone has their own secrets. If Chu Yang did not want to tell him then he won\u2019t ask. He respected the privacy of his disciples.Chu Yang is my disciple. Knowing that is enough!****************************************************************************************************Meng Chao Ran stood there for a while before returning. In the days Chu Yang prepared for the breakthrough, how could he have not known? He careful observed Chu Yang\u2019s actions for many days. This has led to unbearable mental fatigue.However, Chu Yang just had a breakthrough, he was not sleepy at all.In the middle of the night, Chu Yang sat by himself at the top of the mountain. Looking into the darkness, his heart throbbed.Qing Wu, I am now a Martial Warrior! I will be able to cultivate Nine Tribulations to Transcend the Nine Heavens quickly. Then I will have the ability to watch over you and protect you. I will not let you suffer any little injuries.Where are you this moment?Currently Qing Wu is only ten years old? Chu Yang could not help but gently smiled\u2026 what does Qing Wu look like right now? Probably still a little playful runt? Still in pigtails?In the previous life, I did not meet Mo Qing Wu for another nine years. She was nineteen\u2026 I was twenty-five.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThinking about Mo Qing Wu, Chu Yang went back to previous life\u2026 He recalled Mo Qing Wu liked purple bamboo, and he, reminiscing his warm childhood, chose the most purple of bamboo forests to cultivate in. Therefore, at a purple bamboo forest on the Heavenly Misty Peak of the Nirvana Mountains, he and Mo Qing Wu met for the first time.Ultimately, Mo Qing Wu was also attacked near Heavenly Misty Peak\u2019s purple bamboo forest. The place where there were some purple bamboo houses he and Mo Qing Wu built together\u2026There were a few young bamboo shoots\u2026 Mo Qing Wu had carefully planted them one by one along the road he often walked on. At that time, she said, \u201cChu Yang, if I die one day, please spread my ashes on this road\u2026 so my spirit can be part of it\u2026 so every time you walk by here, you can step on me. I voluntarily let you step on me\u2026 even though you might not intend to visit me but only want to see purple bamboo, it would still be good\u2026 I only need to feel your presence even if it\u2019s just for a little while\u2026 a little is good enough.\u201dQing Wu, Qing Wu\u2026Chu Yang thought bitterly. There was a gentle smile on his face and his eyes seemed full of longing!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 33 \u2013 MoleIt was getting late into the night, almost midnight. Chu Yang sat on a large boulder with his arms wrapped around his knees. He was immersed in his memories with his clothes fluttering in the night wind and wrapping around him, making him look like solid pine stump.Another two hours passed. The night\u2019s sky was at its darkest.Just as Chu Yang was about to stand up to go back to his room, he suddenly sensed something out of the ordinary! His gaze sharpened, and he focused on the mountain range on the right.There was a small path leading from another mountain range into Beyond the Heavens Sect that very few people knew about.Under Chu Yang\u2019s intense gaze, there appeared three black shadows gliding forward as quickly as the wind at the foot of the mountain. In the shadows of the night, they appeared and disappeared like apparitions.Chu Yang frowned, this was the best time for secretive actions! Moreover, this darkest window barely lasts an hour. These people clearly hid there earlier and waited till this hour to take action.They absolutely had bad intentions!Remembering Meng Chao Ran\u2019s words about protecting Beyond the Heavens Sect, Chu Yang\u2019s eyes narrowed. He stood up and like a comet, he shot forward. Stepping on the vertical cliff face a few times, he was finally at the foot of the mountain. Using the trees and shrubs as covering, he moved at the fastest possible speed in the direction of the three people.Even though Chu Yang was currently only a first grade Martial Warrior, he was not afraid at all! If he could not fight them he certainly was capable of escaping. If these people truly had malicious intents, Chu Yang felt he needed to get involved to pay back his master and the sect.After only a few moments of giving chase, he had already covered a few miles.Chu Yang moved his body lightly. He was as flexible as smoke. If there was an expert watching him on the side, he would have been shocked. Every place Chu Yang stepped on was in an absolute blind spot. Even though his speed was extremely fast, he continually ended up in places that completely covered his body. The hiding spots that he only just found were actually impeccable positions! Being a few meters away, he could take one glance at the terrain ahead and immediately created a perfect plan of action!Chu Yang kept moving forward; after chasing for about five or six miles, he could see the entrance to Beyond the Heavens Sect in the distance. He suddenly realized something and stopped charging forth. In a flash, his body blended with the shadows of the night. Afterward, he slowly moved forward along the mountain side, not making even the slightest sound\u2026The three shadows huddled in a crack on the mountain side and quietly waited.Not too far in front of them was the entrance to Beyond the Heavens Sect, a place well-guarded day and night by many disciples. Each of the nine peaks sent one disciple to monitor each other as well as jointly guard the entrance.With the exception of Purple Bamboo Garden, all nine peaks of Beyond the Heavens Sect were part of this mountain range.These people obviously did not dare storm the entrance even though, in term of strength, they were probably not afraid of these disciples. However, if an altercation were to occur then they basically rustled the grass and scared the snake. (TLN: another saying, meaning acting rashly and alert the enemy)It seemed that they were either waiting or planned to take some action right there. Chu Yang calculated silently. His body moved little by little in an extremely careful manner. He finally gained another three meters putting the distance between them at less than ten meters.The three all had black scarves covering their faces. They carefully hid themselves behind a large boulder. When Chu Yang saw where they were hiding he could not help but praise them. It would seem this was not their first time here. The place where they were hiding was blocked off on all three sides with on one side facing toward two possible escape routes, one of which was very well hidden. In the case of some unintended event, they could still quickly escape without being surrounded by the enemies.Chu Yang slowed his breathing almost stopping it. His body became an extension of the rock as he quietly waited. When it comes to patience, he was certain that there was no one under the heavens comparable to him.Time slowly drifted when a thin one of the three, having little patience, asked in a low voice, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here? Weren\u2019t the appointment time clearly stated already? Why is that wretch not here yet?\u201d\u201cBe a little patient, don\u2019t be quick to have a temper.\u201d Another person in a black outfit looked around and gave warning. After that, he looked up again suspiciously and said, \u201cWhy do I feel like there are some little movements?\u201dHearing this, the other two became alert as well. Their ears perked as they tried to listen to their surroundings.Chu Yang maintained his breathing, and paid no more attention to their words than he would a passing breeze. He did not move.This was a kind of sense, like when you are walking on a road alone and someone was following you, you can feel this without turning around. One does not have to be a martial artist, any regular person has this sensing ability. However, if one turns around and sees nothing, then one would just assume that such a sense was wrong.Sure enough, the three looked around and were reassured. The black robed person who noticed something earlier now mocked himself and said, \u201cI was just being paranoid.\u201d\u201cCaution is always a good thing.\u201d The other two said in low voices.At this moment, there were some movements at the sect\u2019s entrance. A voice shouted out, \u201cWho goes there?\u201dA firm voice replied, \u201cIt is I!\u201d\u201cAh, it is second elder martial uncle. This disciple was disrespectful.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cSecond elder martial uncle, you are going to cultivate?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Cultivation requires determination, you should also remember that if you put in enough effort to file down steel, you will have a needle one day. (TLN: with hard work, the most difficult of tasks can be accomplish) The natural energy of heaven and earth will be most potent at sunrise. This is also the best time to cultivate.\u201d\u201cYes, we will keep your teachings.\u201dA black shadow slowly went across the entrance. Behind him, the guarding disciples were still praising:\u201cSecond elder martial uncle is an important person in our sect. Even though his cultivation level is so high, he is so down to earth. Moreover, he is extremely diligent; he went out every day at this time to cultivate. His stamina is admirable. I am sure I could not be like that.Another voice said, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t need to be said. Second Elder Martial Uncle is an incredible person; how can you compare?\u201dChu Yang was shocked. This person was really Second Elder Martial Uncle, Li Jinsong! Li Jian Yin\u2019s father \u2013 head of Locking Clouds Peak in Beyond the Heavens Sect, second top person of the sect!Li Jinsong was dressed neatly with sword hanging on his waist. His appearance showed he was going to practice with his sword. He deliberately left the sect and with a jump he flew away, creating a graceful curve in the air\u2026After a few jumps, Li Jinsong neared that place, but he did a few rounds before arriving at that large boulder.It seems this is not the first time they meet. Chu Yang thought to himself. Moreover, the disciple did say that \u201che went out every day at this time to cultivate.\u201d This showed that Li Jinsong had secretly done this many times before.\u201cWhy did you wait until this hour? Any news?\u201d The thin one in the three asked briskly.\u201cAm I late?\u201d Li Jinsong asked with a humph, showing that he was obviously annoyed with that question. He continued, \u201cYou brought the item?\u201d\u201cNo hurry with that item.\u201d Another black outfit person quickly appeased him. \u201cElder brother Li, quickly tell us of the recent changes.\u201dWith another humph, Li Jinsong suppressed his voice and said, \u201cThere is something devilish going on. I want to ask, besides you people, are there anyone else interested in Beyond the Heavens Sect?\u201dThe three black outfits were stunned and stared at each other, \u201cWe are really not clear on this. In any case, Beyond the Heavens Sect is currently in a precarious situation, it is likely that there are people who want to cast their nets.\u201dLi Jinsong said, \u201cAh. A while ago, Wu Yun Liang sent the ninth master, Bao Kuang Lei, along with two top disciples of the sect and his daughter to Iron Cloud Nation.\u201d\u201cIron Cloud Nation?\u201d The three cried out in unison.\u201cExactly, moreover\u2026 This action was very secretive, but, from what I learned, the four of them were attacked en route more than once! Obviously, someone did not want them to get to their destination. Plus, they seem to have been very well informed.\u201d Li Jinsong said with a calm face.Behind them, Chu Yang was astounded. It seemed that Li Jinsong was not the only mole!\u201cWhat was the purpose for going to Iron Cloud Nation?\u201d The three asked, only wanting to know the reasons and obviously without a care for the well-being of Bao Kuang Lei\u2019s group.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Li Jinsong frowned, and immediately added, \u201cIn any case, no matter what happened, they have gone to Iron Cloud. For us, this means half of our goal has been achieved.\u201d\u201cExactly. Beyond the Heavens Sect is in the territory of our Great Zhao, but Wu Yun Liang dared sent people to collude with Iron Cloud! He is really audacious!\u201d One of the black outfits said in a low voice.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cJust this piece of information alone made our journey worthwhile. Li brother, you have done well.\u201d Said another black outfitted person. Even though his face was covered, the sound of his voice showed that he was only smiling outwardly.\u201cI dare not receive such compliments. It was what you have done that helped this situation along.\u201d Li Jinsong said thoughtfully. \u201cYou are part of the imperial army; you have the resources and you certainly would not let things go on their own course if you could help it. Let alone the fact that we have been secretly putting more pressure on Wu Yun Liang making him lean toward Iron Cloud. Even though nothing is finalized yet, my mission is almost complete\u2026\u201dChu Yang was stunned. People from the imperial army? Beyond the Heaven Sect was a sect in Jiang Hu; what did the imperial army have anything to do with it?And apparently, this \u2018imperial army\u2019 referred to the imperial army of the Great State of Zhao!Chu Yang had a vague feeling that an astronomic conspiracy was unfolding. It was likely that the destruction of Beyond the Heavens Sect in his previous life was related to this!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

We will protect Beyond the Heavens Sect, making it an imperial sect. Your disciples can become officials of the court with glorious future and make their family proud!\u201dHe smiled and continued, \u201cSuch a wonderful position, even the leader of the Sects\u2019 Alliance would be extremely touched! How could you possibly feel that a few pieces of information such as this is worthy of a lifetime of riches?\u201dLi Jinsong became livid, each word was filled with anger, \u201cThe lives of my entire household are in your hands. Why bother with talk of riches?\u201dThe black outfitted person thought for a moment and eventually lowered his voice, \u201cIn truth, Martial brother Li, I dare not hide the facts. You wanted a Thousand Year Old Crystal Mushroom\u2026 it\u2019s really too hard to find. The Minister sent eighteen teams to search everywhere. Once it is found, it will be brought to you immediately.\u201dHe continued with a cheerful tone, \u201cThe Minister knew you are currently most concerned with this! Martial brother Li, you are one romantic person\u2026 such a rare and mysterious treasure between heaven and earth is the stuff of dreams and not always achievable. If Martial Brother Li does not have the patience, there\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201dWith a humph, Li Jinsong said angrily, \u201cI can wait, for a hundred years even. However, my wife cannot. She depends on it to save her life!\u201d\u201cOf course, of course. That\u2019s why even though Minister Diwu cannot send a Thousand Year Old Crystal Mushroom, he gave us Thrice-Born Pills to bring to you.\u201d The black outfit person laughed contentedly, \u201cThree!\u201dLi Jinsong perked his head, \u201cReally?\u201dNot only him but even Chu Yang, who was secretly listening was a little shocked. Thrice-Born Pills! Thousand Year Old Crystal Mushroom! These were things you could not hope to find. Why would Li Jinsong need them?Thrice-Born Pills were not actually medicine pills but a kind of fruit from a strange tree. This tree would sprout and grow branches, but then would wilt after ten years. After twenty more years, it would sprout more branches for fifty years, making itself a small tree. At that time it would wilt for a period of fifty years, and after that, it would sprout for a third time. This time it takes two hundred years to become a fully grown tree and bloom a kind of poisonous flower. The fruits from these flowers are Thrice-Born Pills!These fruits were the size of a grape. As for the tree, it would immediately wilt and never recover again.Thrice born for a total of 330 years to have fruits just once. The value of such fruits was obvious, but the effectiveness as a medicine was even more so. It could be used to end chronic illnesses, to keep incurable diseases at bay, to treat serious injuries, increase internal energy, and increase life expectancy!As for thousand years Crystal Mushroom, that was the stuff of legends\u2026 under the heavens, it was the ultimate medicine! It was said that it could save lives, regrow muscles, bones, etc\u2026 as for the specifics, even Chu Yang did not know.However, both of these are similar in that they cure illnesses. Is it possible that Li Jinsong\u2019s wife is sick?This Minister Diwu was really generous. He gave Li Jinsong three Thrice-Born Pills in one shot!\u201cThree Thrice-Born Pill fruits, enough to keep my wife safe for three years!\u201dThere appeared a jade box in the black outfit person\u2019s hand. He said, \u201cMinister Diwu said that if he cannot find Crystal Mushroom in three years, he will definitely find other ways to compensate for your loss!\u201dHe raised his voice and said, \u201cMinister Diwu was clear on this matter. For a thousand times, he would not deceive you in this matter! The minister said that even though both sides are in this for their own benefits, frankness and earnestness are critical! These words came straight from the minister\u2019s mouth.\u201dLi Jinsong bowed his head and said in a low, serious voice, \u201cThank you for the minister\u2019s frankness and sincerity. Li Jinsong understands!\u201dHis head was bowed down when he said this. The sky was also dark so his facial expression could not be seen\u2026 but Chu Yang, who was hiding behind a boulder sneered internally. By the sound of it, this Minister Diwu seemed great. However, adding on Li Jinsong\u2019s words from earlier, \u201cThe lives of my entire household are in your hands. Why bother with talk of riches?\u201d all of his praises became rotten.It was true that Li Jinsong was greedy. However, he did not voluntarily do this; he was certainly being threatened.The person who threatened him was the one talking about trust? If Li Jinsong truly believed in it then he must be the number one idiot under the heavens!\u201cThrice-Born Pills is extremely precious. If you want to preserve them well, then just leave them in this box. Only open it when necessary\u2026 you should know that each time you open this box, the potency of the Thrice-Born Pills will decrease.\u201d (TLN: Hmm, sounds suspicious\u2026)The black outfit person solemnly instructed and continued, \u201cAbout Iron Cloud, we need to quickly report this to Minister Diwu. The minister will certainly have some plans for this. Martial Brother Li, we bid farewell!\u201dWith an authoritative voice, Li Jinsong said, \u201cI won\u2019t see you off then\u2026\u201d And with that, he carefully pocketed the jade box into his robe.The three people in the black outfits had gone far away, yet Li Jinsong still remain standing in the same place. With a heavy sigh, he went back with the jade box. In the blink of an eye, he disappeared in the darkness.Chu Yang continued to stand still in his hiding place behind the boulder. His breathing was maintained without any changes.As expected, the sound of the wind rose, Li Jinsong appeared once again. He made a few rounds of the surroundings, and when he was sure there was no one was around to spy on him, he flew away.\u201cHe finally left\u201d, Chu Yang sighed inwardly. He knew that the secrets he heard today were closely related to the survival of Beyond the Heavens Sect. This was extremely important! If he were discovered, then surviving would be as difficult as flying to heaven!Cannot be too careful!No one could imagine that the mole in Beyond the Sects was the second ranking member of the sect, the all powerful Li Jinsong!Chu Yang wanted to move and stretch his arms and legs which seemed to have hardened when suddenly his whole body stiffened. He quietly looked up ahead.In the place where the four were just talking, there unexpectedly appeared from out of nowhere, an apparition of a black outfitted person!Chu Yang\u2019s scalp became a little numbed because he couldn\u2019t believe that he completely did not detect when this person had come!This person was dressed in black. His tall and slender stature stood motionless\u2026 after a moment, he suddenly sighed and said casually, \u201cChu Yang, come on out!\u201dThe hair on Chu Yang\u2019s nape stood on its ends. It seemed this person clearly knew where he was. Moreover, who he was!It was too late for escape now. Plus, from the sound of his voice, it did not seem he had any malicious intentions. Chu Yang decided to come out. He walked forward step by step.\u201cYou heard everything?\u201d That person asked with his hands clasped behind his back. With his back toward Chu Yang, he asked in a leisurely manner.\u201cYes, you heard everything as well? Moreover, compared to me, you probably heard even better, right?\u201d Chu smiled slightly as he narrowed his eyes and asked back.The other person let out a deep laugh as he slowly turned around. The darkest period has now passed, and the sky slowly brightened. The early morning sun rays from the horizon weakly shined on the face of this person. His black beard loosely hung in front of his chest, his face straight and serious, letting out an aura that demanded respect\u2026After seeing him, Chu Yang could not help but become even more shaken. He was so surprised that he was speechless.This person, unexpectedly, was the Sect Master of Beyond the Heavens Sect \u2013 Wu Yun Liang!Why was he here? If he was here, then he definitely already knew what Li Jinsong was up to\u2026 why didn\u2019t he stop him?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt the moment, a curtain of doubt was raised inside Chu Yang\u2026 he only felt hazy and confused. Even a person who lived two lifetimes like him could not make sense of this entanglement.\u201cFollow me.\u201d Wu Yun Liang said, looking at brightening sky. Suddenly, he grabbed Chu Yang\u2019s sleeve and pulled him. They ran quickly, turning east and west until they got to a crevice in the mountain not too far from Purple Bamboo Garden.This crevice was not especially secluded but it was relatively empty and deserted. This was because there was nothing of interest in this crevice so Chu Yang and the others normally did not bother to come here.On the wall there was a spot that had collapsed making a perfect little cave almost two meters deep.\u201cCome in.\u201d Wu Yun Liang entered first.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Sorry for the mistake.)Chu Yang followed. Upon entering, he found a small, glossy stone pedestal. It seemed to have been made into a sitting bench and looked like it had been used very often.As expected, with a flourish of his sleeves, Wu Yun Liang sat down on it. He looked up at Chu Yang and stared carefully at him for a moment. The corner of his mouth revealed a smile; there was even perhaps a feel of familiarity.\u201cYou were not bad.\u201d Wu Yun Liang\u2019s first sentence was short.\u201cThose three were people from the Golden Horse Rider Department of Great Zhao. More specifically, the Golden Horse Rider Department currently being controlled by Prime Minister Diwu Qing Rou. An extremely secretive organization!\u201d Wu Yun Liang began explaining without giving Chu Yang a chance to talk.\u201cGolden Horse Rider Department, Diwu Qing Rou\u2026\u201d Chu Yang seemed to be thinking about something. These two names were so big in his previous life that the mere mention of them was like the sound of thunder!The Golden Horse Rider Department was actually the secret weapon of the Great Zhao Dynasty. (TLN: Think Hollywood\u2019s version of CIA/MI-6)As for Diwu Qing Rou, the name might sound gentle (TLN: Qing Rou means gentle), but he was in fact a powerful and talented character; world renowned! Legend has it that this person did not understand martial arts. However, he had started reading at three, and had finished schooling at five. By the time he was thirteen, his scholarly talents had made him famous all over. He became an official at the age of sixteen, and was able to manage a whole group of towns in an orderly manner. At the age of 20, he oversaw the entire Southeast territory of Great Zhao. At 25, he became an official in the imperial court and was involved in management of the territories of the entire Great Zhao Nation. At the age of 30, he ascended to the position of Prime Minister. This person was now not yet thirty-five years old, but he served only under one person and had dominion over millions. He could call the winds and stop the waves (TLN: Not literally, of course). With control over the imperial court and military officials, he was all-powerful under the heavens!Such achievements, there could be only one in all of time!Before, the officials were always in conflict with each other. However, this Minister Diwu brought the scholars and the military officials together. This was because he did not merely have the capability to oversee a nation but he also had the ambition to expand beyond the borders!Uniting all under the heavens was the biggest desire of Diwu Qing Rou!In Chu Yang\u2019s previous life, this Diwu Qing Rou commanded all of the Lower Three Heavens continent! It seemed that across the Lower Three Heavens, there was not one conspiracy without the shadow of influence of this Diwu Qing Rou!It was precisely under the orders of Diwu Qing Rou that the Golden Horse Rider Department carried out the assassination of the next ruler of Iron Cloud Nation \u2013 Crown Prince Tie Bu Tian. After that, he sent the armored cavalry of Great Zhao to aggressively attack Iron Cloud and decimated them in one move. Great Zhao became as powerful as the sun at midday and took over Limitless Nation as well. From then on, all of the Lower Three Heavens was ruled by Great Zhao!The most powerful thing about Diwu Qing Rou was the fact that he did not just use the imperial court\u2019s power but also that of the sects in Jiang Hu. He used their conflicting interests and greed to either cause chaos or create allies. With his skillful manipulation, he gradually led them to inadvertently help Great Zhao accomplish those tasks that either it could not do or found inconvenient\u2026Furthermore, what was worse was that they did not notice this. If he did not admit it himself, then it was likely that the sects would be forever blinded by his deceptions!In the previous life, when Chu Yang was looking for the Nine Tribulation Sword fragments in the Upper Three Heavens, Great Zhao nation has already conquered Iron Cloud and Limitless. It has already began to expand its borders beyond that. The name Golden Horse Rider Department had become a permanent fixture under the heavens because of these conquests.Wu Yun Liang naturally did not know that Chu Yang knew these things and had continued to explain to him what the Golden Horse Rider Department was.\u201cThis disciple only wants to know why you did not stop it?\u201d Chu Yang\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cWhy should I stop it?\u201d Wu Yun Liang smiled.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThese past years, I have, without fail, gone with second martial brother to that \u2018cultivation spot\u2019.\u201d Wu Yun Liang smiled sarcastically, \u201cEven though he did not know it, I already knew since that very first contact they made five years ago.\u201dChu Yang became even more alarmed. While he was still looking at Wu Yun Liang\u2019s warm face, he could not help but felt a sense of loss rising up inside him.In his previous life, because the sect was destroyed and Chu Yang never had any interaction with this sect master, he looked down on him. A master who let his sect get destroyed was not worthy of any mention. But now that he knew Wu Yun Liang to be shrewd person\u2026 Anyone who thought that he was dumb would truly be the dumb one!Actually, when you think about it, no one becomes a sect leader by being an idiot. (TLN: I beg to differ; there are plenty of lucky idiot heroes in wuxia.)However, Wu Yun Liang did let a conspiracy develop for five years!Why?Chu Yang looked at Wu Yun Liang\u2019s composed face and seemed to vaguely understand a little bit.\u201cAt first they wanted to incite a rebellion inside Beyond the Heavens Sect\u2026 Truthfully, since I became Master of Beyond the Heavens Sect, the other martial brothers were disgruntled. The elders of the sect even started to split into factions\u2026 a rebellion was already starting. A situation like this needed to be purged before the sect can grow stronger.\u201d Wu Yun Liang said with a heavy heart, \u201cThat is why I let him do what he did. If I was not successful, then the sect would have been destroyed anyway. There was nothing more to say.\u201d\u201cBut by the second year, they gradually exposed their true purpose. That was to use the excuse that Beyond the Heavens Sect colluded with outsiders to start a war between Great Zhao and Iron Cloud. Using this pretext, they would pay only a small price to destroy Iron Cloud and further their plans to unify all under the heavens.\u201d\u201cHow can this be?\u201d Chu Yang said fearfully, \u201cBeyond the Heavens Sect, no matter how strong, is only a sect. How could it be in the position to spark a war between two countries?\u201d\u201cNothing is impossible. What\u2019s important is whether you do it and how you would do it.\u201d Wu Yun Liang laughed coldly.\u201cUh, sect master, why did you say these\u2026 things to me? Was this not the first time we met?\u201d The more he heard, the more Chu Yang became uneasy. He felt as if he was be pulled into a quagmire of a big conspiracy. His legs was covered in mud and he had no way of pulling them out.\u201cCalm down, don\u2019t rush. Of course I told you for a reason. Have a seat first.\u201d Wu Yun Liang glared.Chu Yang reluctantly raised his eyebrows and found a rock to sit on. It might have been deliberate or unintentional, but the rock he was sitting on was bigger and taller than that of Wu Yun Liang.Earlier when he was standing and Wu Yun Liang was sitting, it seemed like he was the subordinate listening to orders. However, now that he was sitting down, even though his height was about the same as when he was standing, the appearance seemed to have reversed with Chu Yang looking down from above.The Sect Master was sitting below him; this situation was indeed paradoxical.Wu Yun Liang raised an eyebrow, and laughed as if it was nothing. He looked at Chu Yang without paying any mind to his disrespect and continued to talk.Chu Yang let out a pained laugh internally. He only needed Wu Yun Liang to give one hint of discontent, then he would have a reason to take his leave and escape from this predicament. Surprisingly, this cunning man was not bothered by it at all.Curiosity can kill. This is true enough.Chu Yang was full of regrets. Did I have nothing to do but follow those three? I have bought my own noose\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cEven though the Crown Prince of Iron Cloud, Tie Bu Tian, is still young, only seventeen or eighteen, he is extremely talented. Moreover, he values the forces in Jiang Hu, especially martial artists. With his own hands, he created a place called Bu Tian Pavilion, a place for gathering heroes from all over! Particularly, this person has respect for the wise; he searches for good talents and treats them generously. He is a rare youth! Iron Cloud Nation\u2019s King Tie Shi Cheng is sickly and constantly bedridden. The whole country depends on Tie Bu Tian for day to day operations\u2026 Even though he has not ascended to the throne yet, he is the pillar of Iron Cloud military!\u201d\u201cYou can say that if Tie Bu Tian died, Iron Cloud nation will definitely fall!\u201dChu Yang drooped and mumbled in agreement.Talented youth, then what? He will be killed three years from now. The country will be destroyed along with him. Chu Yang clearly remembered the prince of Iron Cloud Nation\u2019s death was because Great Zhao sent more than five hundred expert martial artists. They even had to spend a large sum of money to hire assassin organizations in order to be successful. However, no one was alive afterward!At the time, this story shook the whole world. Iron Cloud national also retaliated with extreme cruelty; it was a blood soaked revenge. Thousands died in the four districts on Great Zhao border \u2013 even livestock were not spared! It was clearly seen how important the Crown Prince of Iron Cloud was\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That\u2019s why many people are casual and friendly before they are successful, but become unapproachable afterward. This is not because they have changed, but because of safety reasons!\u201dChu Yang acted indifferent on the outside, but internally said, \u201cThat makes sense.\u201d\u201cGreat Zhao has, over the course of time, sent more than twenty groups of assassins to kill Tie Bu Tian, but they have all retreated in failure. That\u2019s why they wanted to use our Beyond the Heavens Sect.\u201d Wu Yun Liang let out an icy laugh.With an \u201cah\u201d, Chu Yang said, \u201cThat\u2019s why eldest martial uncle decided not to expose their plan after learning about it, but instead designed your own plans?\u201d\u201cNot bad!\u201d Wu Yun Liang stroked his beard and said, \u201cThey wanted to take advantage of us; why not take advantage of them and use this opportunity to rise up?\u201dChu Yang finally understood the reason why Beyond the Heavens Sect was destroyed in his previous life! It was because Wu Yun Liang wanted to use the opportunity of two countries in conflict to rise up. However, his over-calculated plan turned into shreds\u2026This was too complicated.When it comes to dealing with an anomaly like Diwu Qing Rou, no one can be sure of anything! Even someone from his previous life who was hailed as a master of calculation and manipulation, Mo Tian Ji, had to stand inferior to Diwu Qing Rou!After conquering all of the Lower Three Heavens continent, the people praised Diwu Qing Rou with the following chant: One person but more than a hundred thousand mighty advisors! When referring to him even his enemies have to concede that he is the one and only in history!This person was born full of schemes; a natural politician and military commander! Moreover, he was regal and has comprehensive knowledge of all things. It has been said that even though Diwu Qing Rou does not know any martial arts, if he were to enter Upper Three Heavens, he would at least become a ruler over a territory! This level of admiration was terrifying!Wu Yun Liang was taking a big risk. Like walking on a tight rope on the side of the thousand meter tall mountain, he only needed to have one little slip then his body would be in pieces!\u201cI know I am playing with fire!\u201d Wu Yun Liang said with a worrisome countenance, \u201cOne slip and Beyond the Heavens Sect would surely be destroyed. But\u2026 but I can\u2019t afford not to play this game.\u201dChu Yang nodded in agreement.\u201cGreat Zhao has applied a lot of pressure on Beyond the Heavens Sect all these years for their plans. However, time and time again they did not push us to the point of death, just enough for us lean toward Iron Cloud.\u201d\u201cWe only need to completely side with Iron Cloud. The moles in the sect\u2026 besides your second martial uncle, there are three others from the ten of us\u2026 all in collusion with other sects. This is also the reason why these past few years the other sects also bullied us a lot. I imagine this is also part of Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s plan. We just have yet to see what his real purpose is. One thing that I am sure of is when we have completely side with Iron Cloud, the assassination of Tie Bu Tian would become much easier!\u201d Wu Yun Liang worried. \u201cDiwu Qing Rou only needs Tie Bu Tian to die and does not care about Beyond the Heavens Sect. However, once Tie Bu Tian dies, our Beyond the Heavens Sect will surely vaporize like a mist.\u201dChu Yang face gradually became serious. He did not know all the details of this event, but he did know that, in his previous life, Tie Bu Tian would die, and he would die two months before Beyond the Heaven Sect is destroyed!If Wu Yun Liang continued to follow his plans then the tragedy will most likely happen again! However, if Wu Yun Liang abandoned his plans then Beyond the Heavens Sect will fall under pressure from the court and other sects, all arranged by one Diwu Qing Rou, and perish even quicker!Moreover, the plans were in full motion and cannot be stopped. Beyond the Heavens Sect and Iron Cloud Nation have already established their relationship. Even without Wu Yun Liang, Li Jinsong can still have the authority to act as an official representative. Thus, Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s plans moved forward with ease!With Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s extreme craftiness, this was no difficulty at all. In fact, it was almost a convenience. Besides the reasons mentioned, there was another reason why Diwu Qing Rou chose Beyond the Heavens Sect. Beyond the Heavens Sect was very close to the border between Great Zhao and Limitless nation! Plus the place was full of high mountains and dense forests. An army of ten thousand could be hidden here and no one would be the wiser!This was a strategic spot for war!If Iron Cloud Nation were to perish, Great Zhao would march its army from Iron Cloud through Beyond the Heavens Sect and be in Limitless nation in five days! At that time, if other troops also marched into Limitless Nation from other directions then it would be taken in less than a month!In another word, Diwu Qing Rou had extensively planned layers upon layers of scheme. And he only needed the small key that was Beyond the Heavens Sect to open wide the door that would lead him to unifying all under the heavens!The details of his plans were probably not that simple. It was likely that there were countless conspiracies, manipulations, and knots. All of which Chu Yang had no knowledge of. What he did know were the events which unfolded in his previous life!The issue at hand was that while Chu Yang knew the exact direction of the events to follow but had no power to change it!Not only could he not think of a way to stop it, no one would believe what he has to say. Dear reader, if you stood in the middle of the road and said: In 2050, the earth will be destroyed\u2026 How many people would believe you? Most likely they will uniformly call you crazy\u2026 Moreover, how would you stop the earth from being destroyed? Even if you knew exactly when it would be destroyed, what can you do?Chu Yang was currently in that exact situation. He was just an average disciple of Beyond the Heavens Sect. What skills did he have to change a fate that was created by the military power of hundreds of thousands from the three nations?For the first time, Chu Yang had a kind of feeling: History, it cannot be changed!So what if I had a second life? It\u2019s just the concern of one man with no relation to any others. If history cannot be turned, then what will be of Qing Wu?What should I do?Should I just watch the tragedies unfold this second time around?At this moment, Chu Yang suddenly felt something clear but at the same time fuzzy. His spirit entered into a mysterious realm: If I cannot change these events, then this proves that history cannot be changed. Those who are supposed to die will die. Even after a hundred thousand actions, everyone is still bound by their unchangeable fate!If these events could not be changed then Mo Qing Wu\u2019s fate could not be changed! At most it can be changed by a few years. Like the case of Shi Qian Shan, he was supposed to die in four years and now he died four years early. As for Mo Qing Wu, Chu Yang could try and help her live a few years longer, but she would soon meet her tragic fate! This was one of the things that no one can predict.If the overall course of history could not be change, then Mo Qing Wu would not be able to spend her life with Chu Yang!This was fate!It was already determined! No one can change it!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis was a type of enlightenment, and a profound revelation for the ways of the heavens. In a blink of an eye, Chu Yang was suddenly enlightened.History was the focal point of the ways of the heavens!However, this enlightenment only led him to feel more indignant and violent\u2026 a blood thirsty desire to kill surged inside him!If history could not be changed then it would mean\u2026 Qing Wu would still have to die?No!

His eyes widened.Just a second ago, Chu Yang was quietly listening to him talk. Suddenly after, it seemed as if he fell into a mysterious state. Even though he was clearly within reach, Wu Yun Liang found it unbelievable that he could not feel his breathing. Unexpectedly, there was a sudden outburst of extremely violent killing aura from his body!Wu Yun Liang was so frightened he jumped to his feet, unable to maintain his original composure\u2026The killing aura was violent that Wu Yun Liang felt as if it could kill a hundred thousand people in one shot\u2026 Wu Yun Liang also believed it!With his killing aura rising like a surging tide, Chu Yang\u2019s fists were clenched tightly and his whole body was secreting a dangerous air. A brutal bloodthirsty emotion was convulsing in his meridians!The killing aura was a mighty flood rushing through his meridians and then slammed into his dantian like a tsunami. It tossed and turned in there as if it was a hungry tiger in a cage!At this time, Chu Yang laughed and then powerfully ripped himself from this mysterious state.This was a state from the Way of the Heavens!The state that millions of martial artists earnestly wished to enter, but Chu Yang has just pulled himself from it! Without any regrets!A fierce battle like violent hurricanes; it left Chu Yang shaken and disoriented\u2026 the deepest spot of his mind felt as if the force of waterfall was dumped on it. His orifices simultaneously bled. Suddenly, his eyes radiated as he let out a light roar, \u201cWho said history cannot be inverted? I want to change it! If it doesn\u2019t work one day I will try again for many days\u2026 we\u2019ll see who is more stubborn!!\u201dWu Yun Liang did not know why Chu Yang suddenly roared like that. He could not help but be a little startled and took a few steps back.At this moment, the killing aura inside Chu Yang\u2019s dantian struggled and let out a \u201cbam\u201d and dissipated\u2026 a booming voice laughed and said, \u201cNot bad, not bad. You finally understand the nature of Nine Tribulation Sword\u2026 It is\u2026 Invert Fate!\u201dAs the voice said this, in the sky that was clear for a thousand miles there was the sound of thunder. A column of lightning that seemed to carry the anger of all Nine Heavens slammed down! Blinding white light illuminated several thousand miles making it seemed like daytime! It was infinitely spectacular!There was a thunderous boom in the mountain as it crumbled like bubbles. A few thousand blocks of rocks flew in all directions. The ground shook as if it was the apocalypse!The cave they were in was broken apart and became completely exposed!Wu Yun Liang jumped and screamed in terror\u2026 his body was trembling and pouring sweat. His head was empty as his spirit seemed to have fled to the clouds. He could not make sense of what just happened.Chu Yang clearly heard a voice from his dantian talking inside him. He was in shock and wanted to say something but he did not know how to talk to a voice from inside his dantian. He thought perhaps he could direct communication via his thoughts.While Chu Yang was still bewildered and did not know what to do, that voice boomed once again: \u201cFate is rubbish! Tear it! Break it! Destiny is rubbish! Change it! Go against it! History is rubbish! Destroy it! Kill it! Hahaha\u2026\u201dThese ideas from inside Chu Yang carried with them extreme arrogance with an utter lack of respect for heaven and earth. Along with the thunder and lightning from the surroundings, they became even more powerful!Chu Yang\u2019s spirit was greatly disturbed. He cannot help but muttered the same words, \u201cFate is rubbish! Tear it! Break it! Destiny is rubbish! Change it! Go against it! History is rubbish! Destroy it! Kill it!\u201d\u2026 He felt these words were extremely suited to his personality, arrogant and unruly. This was the kind of feeling he wanted!That arrogant voice inside him laughed loudly and said, \u201cYour thoughts are correct. If you want to change your destiny, from now on, change the state of this whole world! Go against it! If you cannot change destiny and invert history then Mo Qing Wu will definitely still die in misery! Muahahaha\u2026\u201dChu Yang trembled. He wanted to respond when suddenly a voice asked incredulously, \u201cWhat are you saying? What\u2019s going on with you?\u201dStartled, Chu Yang looked up to see Wu Yun Liang evaluating him with a terrified look on his face. Based on his appearance, he did not hear anything that was said. Chu Yang stuttered and carefully checked all the emotions from his dantian. He discovered that they have now all quieted.Everything that passed was like a dream!However, Chu Yang was sure it was not a dream!\u201cI am fine.\u201d Chu Yang laughed. At this moment he discovered his body was soaked in sweat. His clothes looked like he has just walked out of a pond.\u201cWhy did you suddenly become frozen? And how did you just started sweating profusely in the blink of an eye? And your orifices bled? And what happened just now? How could there have been lightning like that? It was strong enough to break open a mountain\u2026\u201d Still a little scared, Wu Yun Liang looked up at the morning sky, and gave Chu Yang a worried look. \u201cChu Yang, do you have some condition you do not want to reveal?\u201d\u2026 without waiting for an answer, he grabbed Chu Yang\u2019s wrist and checked his condition. However, after careful examination, Wu Yun Liang could not find anything out of the ordinary with Chu Yang. He could not help but shook his head and said, \u201cStrange.\u201d\u201cThis disciple is also not sure, maybe spying on those people earlier was too distressful for me. I am scared just thinking about it now.\u201d Chu Yang said meekly.\u201cAh, perhaps.\u201d Wu Yun Liang advised, \u201cYou should not push yourself too much. If you notice that there is something abnormal with your body, you should tell your teacher immediately. If your teacher does not know what to do then tell him to come to me!\u201dChu Yang immediately agreed.Inside, he was still puzzled about those phrases: Invert history! Invert destiny! Invert fate!If you want to change your destiny, you must go against it!I will go against it immediately!Chu Yang was quietly grinding his teeth\u2026 So be it! Mother**, I am not afraid of this rubbish!!If I want to go against it, then how should I do it?\u201cWe should go elsewhere to continue this conversation.\u201d Wu Yun Liang held Chu Yang and flew out of the area\u2026 the earlier commotion had drawn many people toward that spot.The two went round about for a while before finding an area convenient for their conversation. Chu Yang laughed to himself. A master of Beyond the Heavens Sect has to go winding all over the place in his own territory. This was like a thief stealing from his own home.This feeling was indescribably entertaining.\u201cYou heard everything I said earlier?\u201d Wu Yun Liang asked, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dThings started to move quickly in Chu Yang\u2019s head. He remained quietly for a while and then said thoughtfully, \u201cSect Master, are you say that\u2026 If they wanted to use conflict to unify all under the heavens, then we should oblige them and use that momentum?\u201dWu Yun Liang eyes was revealed admiration, \u201cCorrect. Continue.\u201dChu Yang carefully thought everything through and said slowly, \u201cOnce the two nations go to war, then we do not necessarily lose our opportunity, but Iron Cloud will have probably lost theirs! So Sect Master\u2019s idea is to use this chaos to find a way for Beyond the Heavens Sect to live in peace!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cExactly!\u201d Wu Yun Liang\u2019s admiration grew as he continued, \u201cIn all these plans, one person is key!\u201d\u201cThis person is not Diwu Qing Rou, but is Tie Bu Tian!\u201d Chu Yang mused, \u201cAnyone may die, but Tie Bu Tian may not!\u201d\u201cCorrect.\u201d\u201cTie Bu Tian only need to not die then with his authority and ability, he can organize the troops to go to war with Diwu Qing Rou and protect Iron Cloud.\u201d Chu Yang said, \u201cThus, when the war ends, even if Great Zhao wins, they would not fare well! They would not have the power to take Limitless Nation. In fact, with the great damage incurred, they would probably worry about Limitless Nation attacking them! So Diwu Qing Rou would not dare command such reckless action.\u201d\u201cVery well said!\u201d Wu Yun Liang clapped. He looked at Chu Yang as if he has just discovered a precious treasure.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And the thing Diwu Qing Rou is worried about most is none other than Tie Bu Tian! So regardless of everything else and even if he has to maneuver things a thousand times, he has to kill Tie Bu Tian first!\u201d\u201cTherefore, it is our responsibility to protect the life of Tie Bu Tian. Because we went over there from Great Zhao, if Tie Bu Tian dies, we would be the top suspect. Most likely, we would be first to face the fierce revenge of Iron Cloud Nation. Plus, Great Zhao would absolutely not let traitors like us stay alive either.\u201dChu Yang analyzed for a bit and realized that all the plans seemed to revolve around the life and death of one person \u2013 Tie Bu Tian!A youth of seventeen years could become a thorn in the eyes of a world wonder like Diwu Qing Rou\u2026 what kind of monster was this youth?In his previous life, Chu Yang only knew that Tie Bu Tian was assassinated at Primordial Gorge. He also knew that this person had an extraordinary reputation\u2026 but at the time, he did not pay much attention and just ignored these things. Now that he was carefully re-analyzing things, it did seem a bit frightening!A seventeen years old who is already comparable to Diwu Qing Rou!Definitely not of an ordinary type!This reminded Chu Yang of another legend of Upper Three Heavens \u2013 Infinitely Excellent Saber Master Liu Yong Xiang. This worldly talent if still living would be a legendary Martial Artist Saint, a sheer talent who would not pale in comparison to Diwu Qing Rou\u2026!There was also, in Middle Three Heavens, a character who spent a lifetime stirring heaven and earth \u2013 Ao Xie Yun, already world renown at a young age!Finally, there was one who controlled the dark side of Middle Three Heavens \u2013 a female of unknown appearance, the mysterious Jun Xi Zhu!These people along with Tie Bu Tian and Diwu Qing Rou were all heaven sent talents that were hard to find in thousands of years!It was lucky that they were separated into three different regions! If not, it would be hard to imagine what kind of chaotic state the world would be thrown into\u2026\u201cThere is still one thing that you have taken lightly.\u201d Wu Yun Liang looked at him admiringly, \u201cWe only need to help Tie Bu Tian to defeat Diwu Qing Rou, then we would have done a great deed comparable to leaders who helped found countries! At that time, Beyond the Heavens Sect would be able to rise high in position! Moreover, with the appropriate planning, we could even eliminate all of Beyond the Heavens Sect\u2019s hidden dangers at the same time!\u201dChu Yang gave a pained laugh. Defeating Diwu Qing Rou? Easier said than done! For Diwu Qing Rou, regardless if it is political or battle strategy, the status remained undefeated!Want to beat him\u2026 CHALLENGING. Chu Yang thought inward and immediately realized: Wu Yun Liang is right. If I am determined to go against fate in this life then I cannot avoid facing Diwu Qing Rou!And if I continue to hold on to the idea that Diwu Qing Rou cannot not be beaten, then what the heck would I be fighting!I must win! At least, help Tie Bu Tian stay alive to screw up Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s plans! I will hold all of fate\u2019s changes in the palm of my hand!Regardless if it is because of Beyond the Heavens Sect or Tan Tan. There is also master.There is also Qing Wu!Chu Yang was simmering in his determination when he heard Wu Yun Liang sighed and said slowly, \u201cSpeaking of this, Chu Yang, Chu Yang\u2026 in this you have made a huge mistake! With this one mistake you have thrown my carefully prepared plans into chaos! Even at the most basic level, it cannot proceed any further.\u201dChu Yang stuttered in horror, \u201cWhat? What mistake did I make?\u201dHe thought to himself: I didn\u2019t do anything. Why did I suddenly become a terrible criminal?\u201cYou killed Shi Qian Shan! You killed him too soon!\u201d Wu Yun Liang sighed, \u201cShi Qian Shan was an indispensable link in my plans!\u201dChu Yang\u2019s raised his brows, \u201cShi Qian Shan?\u201d\u201cExactly. Even though Shi Qian Shan was underhanded and cunning, he could be seen as a mature adept. Moreover, he was good at kissing up to people. We may look down on his tactics\u2026 but he was really the most appropriate candidate to mingle in the royal court.\u201d Wu Yun Liang sighed again.\u201cMingle in the royal court?\u201d Chu Yang was shocked. What does mingling in the court have to do with this?\u201cI wanted to have a person completely detached from Beyond the Heavens Sect and enter Iron Cloud Nation under a secret identity, and, if possible, become the prince\u2019s confidante. First, to ensure the safety of the prince. Second, if things are successful, this person will become the representative for Beyond the Heavens Sect in the court.\u201dWu Yun Liang said wearily, \u201cLive or die, we have to rise. To take on such a great venture, we simply cannot just go forward as a simple Jiang Hu sect anymore. When the time comes, if there is no one to speak for us in the court, then any big accomplishment would mean nothing. At key moments, we must have someone like that. You can easily buy politicians with gold and other benefits. The only thing is you cannot trust them.\u201dChu Yang nodded in agreement: If they can be bought by you then they can be bought by others. Even by Diwu Qing Rou!That is too dangerous!A person you can trust is best.\u201cI had planned to send Shi Qian Shan to Iron Cloud. However, you killed him.\u201d Wu Yun Liang grumbled.\u201cShi Qian Shan dared to poison his own teacher. At the critical moment, it would not be difficult for him to sell out the sect. In truth, I believe my killing him helped eliminated a hidden tragedy!\u201d Chu Yang opposed fiercely.It was now time for negotiation.Hearing his tune, Chu Yang already knew what Wu Yun Liang has planned for him. He naturally did not want someone leading him by the nose. Even though this matched his goals and his heart was already set, how could he ignore such a rare opportunity to establish a good position?\u201cI originally wanted to appoint two quick-witted people, one to Great Zhao and one to Iron Cloud. The person who goes to Great Zhao would be in charge of gathering information and also, if the sect falls into danger, help save some people to extend our lineage. However, after some thoughts, I abandoned that plan. Having an exit strategy no matter what the situation turns out to be is not necessarily a good thing. It is harder to apply all of your determination with an exit strategy.\u201d\u201cShi Qian Shan, you killed him too soon.\u201d Wu Yun Liang lamented, repeating the same words again.\u201cYes, too soon.\u201d Internally, Chu Yang also had this feeling.\u201cI have observed you these past few days.\u201d Wu Yun Liang said, \u201cChu Yang you are thoughtful, and have great foresights. You are decisive and thick-skinned. When taking action, you seize your opportunity and do not hesitate. Those characters are for doing great things. You are a hundred times better than Shi Qian Shan in many aspects. However, there are three good points that Shi Qian Shan had and you are deficient in.\u201d\u201cThree good points?\u201d Chu Yang nodded and said, \u201cFirst, being dishonorable. Second, following whichever direction the wind blows, smoothing whiskers and patting the horse\u2019s bottom (TLN: to use flattery to achieve goals, I just thought this was a weird idiom and wanted to share). Third, using any means to achieve the goal.\u201d\u201cVery good!\u201d Wu Yun Liang clapped forcefully. \u201cDo you believe that these things are despicable? That they cannot even be called good points? They should even be called horrible?\u201d\u201cNo! This disciple do not think so.\u201d Chu Yang said seriously, \u201cHowever, I will absolutely not be like that. I have my own limits in everything I do.\u201d\u201cRight, these three things on an ordinary person is an abhorrent pile of dog poop. But on a person mingling in the court playing with politics, then they are the basic foundation for playing a good game!\u201d Wu Yun Liang smile mockingly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSince the time you were in that fight with Qu Ping, I secretly observed you every three days. You did very well. You were aware of your own shortcomings and steadfastly observed Shi Qian Shan. From him, you found ways to offset these deficiencies. I was really happy!\u201dWu Yun Liang sighed, \u201cUnfortunately, Shi Qian Shan was tempted by demons and finally buried himself. The only thing was you killed him too soon. If you had let Shi Qian Shan continue to ask for forgiveness, he would have cried streams of tears and found hundreds of reasons. In the end, even if you still wanted to kill him, you would naturally feel that his reasons, strangely enough, are not without basis.\u201d\u201cThis would have been a really important lesson! But you took action and lost this opportunity.\u201d Wu Yun Liang continued, \u201cHuman life is always full of adversity. Struggling alone in the whirlpool of political games while carrying a secret identity and mission, you will face the risk of being flooded to your head with danger. At these critical times, how to ask for forgiveness is most important. You need to be able to keep your life, then you can plan on other things!\u201dChu Yang was quiet for a moment and asked in a deep voice, \u201cSect Master, what you said\u2026 can you do them? Even if you could do them, would you?\u201dWu Yun Liang was stunned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He sighed and said, \u201cI cannot do that either!\u201dThat\u2019s right. If you cannot do it yourself, what right do you have to ask it of others?After a pause, Wu Yun Liang continued, \u201cRegardless, you have already killed Shi Qian Shan so you have to replace him in this task. No more arguments about it. You\u2026 will go and complete this task! In other word, you\u2026 go forth and work hard for your future, and, in the process, help Beyond the Heavens Sect.\u201dChu Yang became taciturn.Once I accept this task, I will completely diverge from my previous life. Moreover, I will have to face an awe-inspiring foe \u2013 Diwu Qing Rou!Only, this is my life\u2019s mission! If I want to change destiny and save Mo Qing Wu, I must defeat Diwu Qing Rou\u2026 invert destiny!However, Chu Yang was currently just a simple jiang hu character. Defeating a world-renowned character like Diwu Qing Rou right now would be as difficult as flying to heaven\u2026Chu Yang had originally thought that once he was reborn, he would at least hold knowledge over everything that happened in the previous life and use that to live a glorious life in this lifetime. But after this, he came to realize that his life would once again fall into endless uncertainty!Whether it was the danger or the enlightenment, compared to the previous life, it was already over a hundred fold more!Change the major events of the world with the force of one person! Nine chances of death, one chance of life and many hidden dangers. Confronting destiny, confronting fate, confronting history, and even confronting the Way of Heaven!Chu Yang cannot retreat!For Qing Wu, for master, for myself, and for the fact that I do care for the rubbish destiny that fate has planned for me! I must invert it!\u201cI will go!\u201d Chu Yang said gravely. His sword-like brows stood up and his lips pursed as if he was carrying a thousand pounds on his back.Wu Yun Liang has just relaxed a little when he heard Chu Yang continued, \u201cBut I have one condition.\u201d\u201cWhat condition? Speak! If the sect could do it, then you can have it. Even if you want this old man to bow in front of you\u2026 I will!\u201d Wu Yun Liang relaxed once again.\u201cI want to enter Seven Shades Congregation Grounds!\u201d Chu Yang lifted his head high and his eyes flashed bright like an electric current. \u201cI do not want to compete for the title of top disciple, nor do I want the position of Sect Master. I just want to increase my power a little. If you can allow this, I will go to Iron Cloud!\u201d\u201cNot a problem! I will let you in tomorrow!\u201d Wu Yun Liang took two unhurried steps when his eyes suddenly flashed with the opportunistic decision.Chu Yang was excited\u2026 Nine Tribulation Sword! You\u2026 are almost mine.Nine Tribulation Sword was the key to inverting destiny! It was also the biggest hidden card in Chu Yang\u2019s hand! An absolute force!\u201cOnce you go on this mission, I will erase all traces of you ever being at Beyond the Heavens Sect. From then on, you are no longer a disciple of Beyond the Heavens Sect. This task is extremely dangerous; you need to accomplish it alone. I can only supply you with checks for thirty thousand taels and a good sword. As for things to support your cultivation, I will secretly give them to you myself whenever we make contact.\u201dWu Yun Liang exhaled and said, \u201cOur opponent is none other than Diwu Qing Rou. We absolutely cannot be careless in anything! If Iron Cloud does not fall, then Beyond the Heavens Sect will rise. On the part of you, Chu Yang, you can be a minister in Iron Cloud if it is your fate. That is your own future! Of course, if you choose to return to the sect when the time comes, we would welcome you!\u201d\u201cAs for the sect\u2019s ranking competition, it is just a ruse to attract attention from outside. It is essentially a little game, not worth anything to you. I just hope that, no matter what happens, you will not forget what I have told you today.\u201dChu Yang nodded solemnly.\u201cCurrently, Qian Qian is already at Iron Cloud Citadel. The others, ninth martial uncle, Xue Ye, and Mu Shang do not know you. I will tell Qian Qian what she needs to do.\u201d\u201cNo, just let me talk to her.\u201d Chu Yang directly rebuffed. You\u2019ve got to be kidding. If I am to change my identity then not letting anyone know is the best plan. To make it perfect, after I changed my identity, even Wu Yun Liang should not know.Then it should be absolutely safe!As for the materials necessary for cultivation that Wu Yun Liang promised\u2026 I will just see how the situation plays out. I only need to have the first fragment of Nine Tribulation Sword in hand, then what worry would I have about cultivation materials?Chu Yang finally clearly understood why Wu Qian Qian liked Shi Qian Shan in the previous life. It was because Shi Qian Shan took on this mission and had a chance to be with Wu Qian Qian\u2026Even if he did not take on this mission, Chu Yang would still have to make a trip to Iron Cloud Nation. This was because the second fragment of the Nine Tribulation Sword was located in an extremely secret location within the citadel of Iron Cloud Nation.In the previous life, Chu Yang happened to be traveling by the citadel of Iron Cloud after the nation has fallen. Thanks to the sense of the first sword fragment, he found the second. It was more than a year after obtaining the first fragment and increasing his cultivation many times that he finally obtained it.Nine Tribulation Sword has strict hierarchical restrictions. If his cultivation level was not high enough and he had strong contact with the second fragment then he could suffer from serious consequences!The morning of the day after.Meng Chao Ran stood in front of Purple Bamboo Forest and looked at the disciple that he has such high hope for. For the longest time, he did not say a word.After a long time, he emotionally sighed, \u201cChu Yang, this time you definitely have nine chances of death and one chance of life! Moreover, you will be in a strange place without anyone. Even with food, clothing, housing, and navigating in dangerous situations, you can only rely on yourself!\u201dHe paused and looked at Chu Yang a while before saying, \u201cYou\u2026 did you think about this thoroughly?\u201dChu Yang wanted to answer when Meng Chao Ran waved his arm to stop him, \u201cYou do not need to answer so quickly. Think carefully first. With your master here, whatever you do not want to do, no one can force you! If you don\u2019t want to, I will find the Sect Master and ask him to withdraw his order right away!\u201dChu Yang was touched. He was critical point where he has to make one of the most important decisions of his life. And Meng Chao Ran, who was always composed over a thousand things, has finally lost control and shown his deep feelings.\u201cThere are many things in life that we know we cannot do but still have to. Just as there are many things we know we should avoid but still cannot avoid. It was master who told me that we must have something in life to protect and care for.\u201d Chu Yang said sincerely, \u201cThis mission I am undertaking is because of the things I want to protect\u2026 I must do it!\u201dMeng Chao Ran remained quiet. After a long time, he walked toward Chu Yang and patted his shoulder. As he lifted his arm, it seemed to stop mid-air\u2026 Meng Chao Ran softly lowered his arm and straightened the hem of Chu Yang\u2019s shirt and smoothed out a few wrinkles. Afterward, he took a few steps back and looked quietly at Chu Yang for a moment. Finally, he turned away and looked up at the sky with folded arms. He breathed a deep sigh.\u201cMaster!\u201d With a surge of warmth inside him, Chu Yang could not help but call out.A long while later, Meng Chao Ran waved his sleeve, and spoke with a husky voice, \u201cGood! I will bring you\u2026 to Gathering Clouds Peak! To Seven Shades Congregation Grounds!\u201d After saying so he started to march away without turning back.Meng Chao Ran did not dare to turn around. He was afraid his disciple would discover his inner weakness.He only had three disciples in his whole life. A few days ago, the first disciple betrayed him and died. Currently, the second disciple was about to embark on an uncertain journey, one that would certainly be with a thousand difficulties and one chance of life!How could this make any teacher feel reassured?**********************************************************Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTeacher and student aimed toward the direction of Gathering Clouds Peak and went silently. Meng Chao Ran in the front, Chu Yang in the back. Neither one opened their mouths.Walking early in the morning, the mountain wind was chilly to the bone. The two felt as if the weather today was extremely bleak, as if it was carrying with it a burdensome sense of separation.After a long moment, the mountain came into view and Chu Yang finally opened his mouth, \u201cMaster, Tan Tan, he\u2026 still doesn\u2019t know about this, I\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will take really good care of him.\u201d Meng Chao Ran said coldly, \u201cFrom now on, I will treat him like I would an only child. After all, if you die, I can only rely on Tan Tan to take care of me in my old age!\u201dChu Yang held his tongue and did not dare say anything else, but he was completely reassured.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With those words, Tan Tan would surely remain safe and sound.As they were crossing the mountain gate, the disciples watching the gate saw Meng Chao Ran\u2019s cold and unhappy face. It seemed like a bag of volatile explosive, so they dared not say one word but simply let the two pass.Wu Yun Liang was already waiting at the door.Today, all of the disciples were sent to Locking Clouds Peak for evaluations. This was Wu Yun Liang\u2019s tactic to keep things secretive for Chu Yang.Seeing Wu Yun Liang, Meng Chao Ran\u2019s gaze became cold but he did not say anything.Wu Yun Liang gave a pained laugh. He too did not bother with words, but said curtly, \u201cFollow me.\u201d and led the way.On the way into the main hall, they passed the ancestral altar. Wu Yun Liang quietly reached out his arm and opened a secret doorway, and led the two in.The passage was winding downward like a cave going deep into the heart of the mountain. Then suddenly, a majestic hall appeared. In front of this hall was a carved green jade door.The temperature here was extremely cold.\u201cYour master and I will wait here. Only one person can enter Seven Shades Congregation Grounds at any time. Go by yourself. How much power you can harvest will depend entirely on you. Once you go through this door, keep walking straight forward. After going through seven doors like this, you will have reached Seven Shades Congregation Grounds! Remember, if you feel you are unable to handle the cold in there you must come back out immediately. You absolutely cannot force your body beyond its limits to gain more power!\u201dChu Yang nodded in reply and looked up at the tall jade door. There was a flash of sharpness in his gaze.His dantian was bouncing with excitement. As if it had just sensed something, Nine Tribulations Sword Spirit in side him suddenly started spinning wildly. It was like an excited child that has just gotten its favorite toy!Looking at Chu Yang going through the door, Wu Yun Liang and Meng Chao Ran stood shoulder to shoulder but did not say anything. After half a day, Meng Chao Ran finally said quietly, \u201cEldest martial brother, do you know who Chu Yang is?\u201dWu Yun Liang remained taciturn and did not say anything.\u201cChu Yang, I took him in when he was only three months old. I stayed by his side every day, nurturing and raising him. It has been like that all these years. Calling me his teacher is not quite accurate; I am his father and mother as well!\u201d\u201cHis name was given by me\u2026 Chu Yang, early morning light, shining sunrise \u2013 this was the representation of my biggest hope in life! Eldest martial brother, do you understand?\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Wu Yun Liang sighed heavily.\u201cYou still don\u2019t understand!\u201d Meng Chao Ran was standing bleakly when he suddenly turned and, without warning, palmed Wu Yun Liang in the face. Bam! Wu Yun Liang was pushed backward, but, surprisingly, he did not let out a sound.Without a care, Meng Chao Ran jumped up and continued with an aggressive kick in Wu Yun Liang\u2019s stomach sending him to the ground. Then he landed on this sect master and started to pour down a shower of punches.The sound of the punches rang out. In this area more than ten meters underground, the two did not say a word. Meng Chao Ran has let out all his aggressions on the sect master!From the beginning to end, Wu Yun Liang did not say anything nor did he fight back. When Meng Chao Ran had landed more than one hundred punches, he stopped. The master of Beyond the Heavens Sect\u2019s face was swollen like a pig and his whole body was covered with bruises.\u201cJunior martial brother\u2026 Now, this is the real you! It has been twenty years, I finally get go see you lose control. These past years, you remained cold and emotionless, it was really annoying\u2026 hahaha, hack\u2026\u201d Wu Yun Liang sprawled on the ground coughing. He continued, \u201cThat\u2019s why I let you beat me up, even if it was worse, it\u2019s would be worth it! I am really happy!\u201d\u201cIf something happens to Chu Yang, I will help you feel really happy every day! Every day as cheerful as this one!\u201d Meng Chao Ran stood up and said casually.\u201cJunior martial brother\u2026 No only Chu Yang, but even you and I are drowning in this vortex as well\u2026 no one\u2019s survival is certain! This is the destiny of our Beyond the Heavens Sect!\u201d Wu Yun Liang arduously stood up. With just a little movement, his whole body was sored. He could not help but gasp and complained, \u201cYou, you\u2026 damn it\u2026 you don\u2019t even have a little love.\u201dWith a hmph, Meng Chao Ran turned around and looked at the green jade door. His countenance was anxious as he sank into deep thoughts. His gaze grew more and more conflicted.**********************************************************Chu Yang walked straight forward. On the two sides are the rock walls that has single smooth pearls placed at a distance from each other. They seemed to emit a dim light. Deep underground, this made people feel as if it was a dream.The Nine Tribulations Sword spirit in his dantian became more agitated as if it was finally meeting a loved one that it has not seen in a long time.As the second jade door opened, the icy cold air became colder. If a normal person came to this place, he would have to activate his internal energy to be able to withstand it. However, Chu Yang did not feel any discomfort. It was quite the opposite. He felt comfortable from head to toe!Internally, Chu Yang was fortified like a stone block. Every step was steady, without any hint of hesitation.The third door!The fourth door!Every step Chu Yang took was even; his breathing was stable. This showed that he continued to maintain his alertness like it was any normal day, and he was not mesmerized by the number one rarity under the heaven that was Nine Tribulations Sword.The fifth door\u2026 opened.The sixth door!Chu Yang did not change even a bit.Suddenly, there was a sigh from inside him. The mysterious booming voice has once again spoken, \u201cYour personality completely matches with Nine Tribulations Sword! It seems your previous life was full of suffering and killing, polishing you from a rough gemstone into a precious jewel that glitters and shines!\u201dChu Yang\u2019s legs did not stop walking. He asked internally, \u201cWho are you? Person or demon?\u201dIt was this same voice that arrogantly said things like \u201cinvert fate\u201d and then disappeared. And no matter how Chu Yang tried, it did not come out again.But today, under these circumstances, it has unexpected came out of nowhere.However, when Chu Yang asked, that voice once again became incognito. A long time passed and it did not answer his question. When Chu Yang finally pushed open the seventh door (TLN: Author wrote ninth, but I am pretty sure he meant seventh) that voice said in exhaustion, \u201cI am currently very weak, every word I say is very draining. Chu Yang, hurry up and get the second Nine Tribulations Sword fragment.\u201d\u201cSecond fragment?\u201d\u201cYes, second fragment\u2026 energy of heaven and earth, heaven\u2019s talent and earthly treasure, rare material, etc.\u2026 are the things essential to Nine Tribulations Sword\u2026 They are also what I need to recover my strength\u2026 \u201c, that voice became lower and lower, more and more faint, as if it could dissipate in the air at any moment. \u201c\u2026 Help me, I can help you invert this fate\u2026\u201dThe voice disappeared as if it has just used up the last drop of energy.Currently, Chu Yang was standing outside the last door, the door in the deepest place \u2013 the seventh door. (TLN: wrote ninth again, still sure he meant seventh, 'seven doors\u201d, 'seven shades\u201d)The inside was empty, but an icy cold air that seemed capable of instantly freezing a person rushed in from all directions. It surrounded Chu Yang, and not long after formed a layer of white frost.Nine Tribulations Sword inside the dantian became violently agitated. The cold air was like a boundless tide cascading into Chu Yang\u2019s body. It followed his meridians and poured straight into Nine Tribulations Sword spirit\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFor four full hours, Chu Yang did not even move one bit. The cold air fiercely and continuously flowed into his body.After four hours like that, the cold air finally weakened. At that moment, Chu Yang felt his body had recovered its ability to move. He carefully observed his surrounding and took one step toward the left.His dantian cramped up immediately as if trying to stop him from toward that direction.He took one step to the right and Nine Tribulations Sword emitted a joyfulness. When he took seven or eight more steps and came next to the rock wall, the Nine Tribulations Sword spirit quieted, but this was the quiet of extreme excitement!This is the spot!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The kind of impulse that was so strong that it made Chu Yang heart pound almost to the point that it could jump out of his chest.He gritted his teeth and decided that even if he could not do it, he must!Chu Yang turned his arm\u2026 With a swoosh, he pulled out his sword. Then he started to activate his internal energy and directed it into the sword. Suddenly, the cold energy that was absorbed by Nine Tribulations Sword spirit inside his dantian poured out into the sword on its own. Within a moment, the ordinary sword became iridescent and transparent and emitted a brilliant light!Shining its light over the entire cave as if it was daylight!Swoosh!Chu Yang swung the sword on the wall to test it out. He wanted to see how tough it was before deciding on what to do next. But he certainly did not expect that a light swing of the sword would send it into the wall like it was tofu. One swoosh and, with the exception of the hilt, the entire sword was in the wall!Chu Yang was extremely happy. Why is it so soft?He tried to pick at the wall with his hand but, of course, it did not give. Chu Yang kept trying until the tips of his fingers were hurt and numb before he realized that the unnatural cold energy was this stone wall\u2019s weakness!With the sword full of cold energy, Chu Yang slashed into the wall and using force, he made a deep cut about three feet across. After that, he made three more cuts creating a rectangle on the wall. Chu Yang threw his sword aside, and placed his hands on the rectangle he just created. He activated his internal energy and pulled!With a swish, the few hundred pounds block followed his hands and left the wall. It dropped on the ground.Without resting, Chu Yang continually slashed the wall. Blocks after blocks was removed from the wall, lying in a pile on the ground\u2026 not too much time passed before he was drenched in sweat!On the ground, there was now almost a hundred of such blocks.The sword slashed deep into the wall once more, when suddenly a \u2018Chink\u2026!\u2019 sound emanated out. Nine Tribulations Sword spirit also made a \u2018Pop\u2026!\u2019 and suddenly jumped and spun inside his dantian. It currently had such extreme excitement that seemed to be uncontrollable!The sword point!Finally, after pulling out a large block, Chu Yang\u2019s eyes narrowed\u2026 Underneath that stone block was the sword point, laying quietly and glowing.Its length was about that of a palm. It was pointy and sharp. The sides had a silvery white luster, but the rest of it seemed to be covered in a pink metallic sheen. This was the blood radiance, characteristic of weapons made specifically for killing! An ancient, fierce aura surrounded the sword point.There was no sheath covering and protecting it. Even though the sword point fragment has been lying like that for who knows how many years, it was still shiny. Moreover, the surface has a faint glow surrounding it!Chu Yang can only feel his dry lips, and his heart beating like a drum\u2026 He immediately regained his composure, then reached out and grabbed the sword point!The moment the sword point touched his hand, Chu Yang suddenly raised his eye brows. Sweat started to pour out!The sword point has been buried for so many years, ordinarily, it should have been cold to the touch. However, when Chu Yang touched it, he realized it was burning hot. With Chu Yang\u2019s body current full of cold energy, it was a total contrast. Cold and hot were antagonistic; a thick fog started to rise in the stone room. Everything was barely visible!In addition, an ancient violent aura was suddenly emitted. The sword point in Chu Yang\u2019s hand started to aggressively struggle as if it wanted to cut his hand and fly away!Chu Yang activated his internal energy as his whole body vigorously resist! He became extremely annoyed. In the previous life, I was able to get the Nine Tribulations Sword point without any such demonic incident! Why is everything different in this life?The force of the sword point\u2019s struggle became stronger and stronger. Chu Yang was starting to feel that he could no longer hang on. Finally, the sword point bounced in his hand\u2026 Chu Yang frowned, it made a deep gash in his hand!At this moment the sword point was ready to fly away. If it had managed this, it was likely that Chu Yang will not have the ability to find it again in this lifetime!Just that moment, there was a feeling of rage from Chu Yang\u2019s dantian. The Nine Tribulations Sword spirit seemed to have rushed out. It left the dantian and went into the meridians. In the blink of an eye, it was at Chu Yang\u2019s hand!Right afterward, a strange ancient force from Chu Yang\u2019s palm suddenly flowed into the point of Nine Tribulations Sword! The sword point that was struggling and trying to break free became docile after contact with this ancient force!The cold energy on Chu Yang\u2019s body suddenly disappeared. The heat from the sword point was also gone in a flash\u2026 Then the point of Nine Tribulations Sword in his hand abruptly radiated brightly with an ancient blood-colored light that shot straight up. And with a swoosh, it disappeared. After that, Chu Yang started to notice that the sword point slowly calmed down.After a second, an even stranger event happened!The sword point that was shining brightly now has mysteriously disappeared in Chu Yang\u2019s hand!In his dantian, the surreal Nine Tribulation Sword spirit suddenly quivered as the point materialized!The sword point has returned home!After another second, Chu Yang\u2019s mind was fogged by ancient thought. It was as if someone was speaking from deep inside him:\u201cOne ray of light can pierce thousands.Killing all under the heaven, for what?A sharp will buried deep will not change.Gather mountains and clouds to rule over all.\u201dThere were suddenly these testaments inside Chu Yang along with a strange feeling. Chu Yang was unsettled. His thoughts went to carefully evaluating internally.Chu Yang abruptly realized that these testaments were verses from the Nine Tribulations Transcending Nine Heavens Technique that he had memorized in his previous life! A mysterious force from the Nine Tribulations Sword point in his dantian shot out. It blended with his bones, meridians, blood, muscles, and entire body\u2026During a moment of unconsciousness, Chu Yang martial cultivation suddenly increased. He has just broke through grade one Martial Warrior; he was now grade three Martial Warrior! In addition, it stopped at the peak; he could almost break through. Within moments, he regained his clarity and composure.At the same time, there suddenly appeared the shape of a martial artist in Chu Yang\u2019s mind. With sword in hand, the shape slowly illustrated the sword stances!From action to action, the demonstration was smooth as flowing water. Chu Yang was mesmerized!These sword stances, he already knew in his previous life. However, he had never managed to truly master them\u2026 But now, looking at this, he felt as if there was a supernatural force helping him to understand the my hidden mysteries that had eluded him before.With his previous lifetime, Chu Yang also got the energy and the testaments just like this time. But\u2026 the feeling that he got from this lifetime was completely different!In his previous life, no matter how hard he tried, it did not feel exactly right. Regardless of what he did, he could not truly comprehend it\u2026 It was as if there was a thin veil that he could not pierce. Currently, Chu Yang could understand all the teachings easily! Every meticulous detail and every little advancement was like a clear stream flowing slowly through him. Transparent and articulate!This was with Nine Tribulations Sword spirit\u2019s support! A privilege given to the true owner of Nine Tribulations Sword!Chu Yang closed his eyes and sank deep into this strange state\u2026However, he did not know that the moment the point of the Nine Tribulations Sword advanced into his dantian and the four testaments arose in his mind, a colorless light shot from the center of Beyond the Heavens Sect\u2019s Gathering Clouds Peak straight into the sky\u2026 Afterward, there was a great commotion.Suddenly, dark clouds started to gather on the whole firmament of the Lower Three Heavens.

He said quietly, \u201cWhat brought Official Dong here?\u201d\u201cIt is because of none other than the strange phenomenon that I came.\u201d Dong Wufa\u2019s build was tall, with large hands like fans. His face was thin with prominent, high cheekbones. His eyes were sharp like that of hawks! Anyone who looked at his eyes would immediately think of the scavenging vultures in the deserts.This person was the most powerful official in Great Zhao Nation\u2019s military!In coming here, Dong Wufa has represented both the scholarly and military officials of Great Zhao nation!In a typical royal court, the leaders of two sides would be like water and fire, incapable of coexisting. However, here was the total opposite. In terms of age, Dong Wufa was older than Diwu Qing Rou, but Diwu Qing Rou was the person Dong Wufa respected most!\u201cStrange phenomenon? Yes, it was definitely a strange phenomenon!\u201d The appeared a trace of worry on Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s graceful face as he uttered softly. After finishing, his eyes dropped a little as if mulling over something. He drummed the desk with his fingers making soft tapping sounds.The whole study was quiet. Dong Wufa sat erect facing Diwu Qing Rou. He remained quiet, not daring to disturb Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s thoughts.A long time passed by. The black clouds slowly dispersed and the sky became bright again.Diwu Qing Rou clasped his hands and stood up. He slowly walked toward the window. He looked up and muttered, \u201cOne hour! The black clouds gathered and the sky became dark. Heaven and earth became mixed up. Just now, it seemed like heaven and earth opened up. About one hour. Such a strange phenomenon is truly rare in history.\u201d\u201cPrime Minister, is some major event about to happen?\u201d Dong Wufa\u2019s face paled.Diwu Qing Rou looked up at the sky. A flash of fear appeared in his eyes and immediately disappeared. Sitting behind him, Dong Wufa did not catch this.Diwu Qing Rou slowly turned around and said with a smile, \u201cNothing. It is not clear why heaven and earth became mixed up. Fate has become chaotic. All of the future can no longer be predicted!\u201d\u201cEven with your astrology skill, you still cannot see the future?\u201d Dong Wufa suddenly stood up, his eyes revealing a look of anxiety.\u201cRegardless of anything that might happen, Great Zhao\u2019s destiny to unite all under the heaven was already extremely clear!\u201d Even though Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s voice was soft, it was confident. With certainty, he said, \u201cEverything will proceed as we had planned.\u201d He momentarily paused and then lightly added, \u201cSpeed it up!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Even though Diwu Qing Rou voice sounded normal, its sharp aura made Dong Wufa feel completely reassured. It was as if only Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s words were needed to make the sky falling down seem like a small matter!\u201cYou should go then!\u201d Diwu Qing Rou smiled warmly.\u201cYes, I will leave now.\u201d Dong Wufa stood up, turned around and walked out.Looking at his silhouette disappearing, Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s smiling face suddenly became suspicious and mysterious. He muttered, \u201cHow could this be? The signs were bright like the noon sun. How could this one event of heaven and earth becoming mixed up have given the enemy a chance to live?\u201dDiwu Qing Rou leisurely paced around the study. After a long while, he suddenly formed a fist with his left arm and placed it in front of his chest. His eyes became fierce, \u201cThe candle is almost extinguished in the wind, what\u2019s another little spark! Under Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s hand, how could you form a big fire?!\u201dHis gaze narrowed as if he just came to some sort of decision. He raised his brow and yelled, \u201cCome!\u201dWith just that simple phrase, it was awe-inspiring!*************************************************************In Iron Cloud nation, the heaven-sent Tie Bu Tian also was deep in contemplations as he looked at the sky. His face carried a serious look unsuited to his age.\u201cChaos, everything is in chaos!\u201d Tie Bu Tian muttered. He shook his head and could not help but smiled, \u201cThis chess game under the heavens, Diwu Qing Rou, Diwu Qing Rou\u2026 can you still grasp the situation now?\u201dWhen he said this, Tie Bu Tian\u2019s usually serious face unexpectedly seemed a little playful, even, for a moment, charming.*************************************************************Not only was the Lower Three Heavens, but the sky of Middle Three Heavens and Upper Three Heavens at the same time also became dark! In fact, even in distant places of legends also showed signs\u2026In a wild place of ice, when the sky started growing dark, a pillar of enormous energy suddenly shot down from above. It dispersed the black clouds from a large area and hit a large iceberg causing it to burst\u2026 A black shadow shot straight into the sky. Then it looked around in all four directions. Then as if it had determined that what it had been waiting for has appeared, it suddenly lifted its head and laughed.\u201cThe time for our saintly family to born again has come!\u201d He shouted. Suddenly, he kneeled on the ice, looked up at the sky, and said with tearful eyes, \u201cNine Tribulations seems like nothing; invert heaven; then the sky will shine; the saintly family will rise! Heaven, oh, heaven. This curse has bound us for a few thousand years\u2026 A few thousand years!\u201dIn the mournful cold wind, his voice echoed and lingered in this place of ice and emptiness for a long time. His everlasting desolation, after being relieved of such a heavy burden, were clear as the wind and ice.\u201cChildren! Let\u2019s play an earth-shattering game with this Nine Heavens! Hahaha\u2026 \u201c The black shadow\u2019s roar sounded like thunder!Sounds of cheer rose up from all directions.*************************************************************At that time, the dominant families of Upper Three Heavens and Middle Three Heavens were having secret meetings. However, their topics were all one \u2013 The strange phenomenon.\u201cThe world is about to change. The youths of our family should use this opportunity to enter Jiang Hu to cultivate.

No matter what tactics you use, you must beat them! You must remember this! The world is about to go through a big change.

These words were repeatedly told to every youths in each family, \u201cFind the owner of Nine Tribulations Sword. If you could be friends, then use everything to support this person! If you can only be enemies, then destroy him at all costs!\u201dThe world was in shock. All plans and decisions were made and finalized within an hour!Chu Yang was still currently underground.

When he walked past the door the stone room was filled with icy cold air\u2026 At a glance, there was no difference.However, Chu Yang knew it was different. Even though it was still the Nine Shades Congregation Grounds, it was now missing the aura of the Nine Tribulations Sword!Within the Seven Shades Congregation Grounds, there was an artifact of an extremely cold characteristic buried underground\u2026 In his previous life, it was not until he reached the Upper Three Heavens that Chu Yang accidentally discovered this secret.Now that Chu Yang had obtained the Nine Tribulations Sword point fragment, he had no intentions whatsoever towards the artifact that created the Seven Shades Congregation Grounds.Let Beyond the Heavens Sect keep this power source.Besides, this time Chu Yang had absorbed the cold energy that Seven Shades Congregation Grounds had stored up for many decades! Even though the Nine Tribulations Sword has taken it all up, Chu Yang could use it at will with his own power. There was no difference.This was the benefit for the owner of the Nine Tribulations Sword!Of course, if Beyond the Heavens Sect could not avoid destruction in the future, then Chu Yang would come and obtain the unknown artifact that created the Seven Shades Congregation Grounds. No matter what, he would not let it fall into the hands of others!After stepping outside, Chu Yang could not help but be astonished.Meng Chao Ran was still his cold self, standing there, but\u2026 The Sect Master had become a masked man? Plus, he was really well-covered, only his eyes can be seen\u2026 It seemed the Sect Master\u2019s eyes had become a little smaller; they looked like two small slits\u2026When Chu Yang appeared, Meng Chao Ran and Wu Yun Liang turned to look at the same time. With one glance the two simultaneous felt very puzzled\u2026 This Chu Yang and the Chu Yang from before going into Seven Shades Congregation Grounds were definitely not the same. However, where that difference was, they could not tell. The feeling was surreal\u2026At the same time, Wu Yun Liang felt that Chu Yang was curiously checking him out; his face could not help but became red.\u201cHow was it?\u201d The two asked in simultaneously.Chu Yang was in there for six hours, making the two feel alarmed!Normally, other generations of disciples would enter Seven Shades Congregation Grounds and stay no more than one hour before exiting. Otherwise, the extreme cold energy would freeze them to death! And when they got out, their whole body would be shaking and covered in white frost, looking half alive and half dead.Unexpectedly, Chu Yang was in there for six hours. Plus, he walked out comfortably!The two looked at Chu Yang as if they had just encountered a demon in broad daylight.Chu Yang was confused when he saw that his master and elder martial uncle were staring at him to the point where their eyeballs were about to pop out. He could not help but felt his own face with his hand. If there was a mirror there, Chu Yang would have immediately grabbed it and see if a flower has grown on his face.The two gazes were very weird.Naturally, Chu Yang did not know what it was like when people entered Seven Shades Congregation Grounds for the first time\u2026\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d\u201cIs there anything wrong with you?\u201d The two asked in unison.\u201cNo, nothing at all.\u201d Chu Yang became even more frustrated.The two looked at each other. Chu Yang could clearly see the two tiny eyes of Wu Yun Liang suddenly became big and round!\u201cAck! Ack! Ack!\u2026 What your elder martial uncle meant was\u2026 How is your Seven Shades Absolute Saint Palm?\u201d Meng Chao Ran asked coolly, after a few dry coughs.\u201cI still haven\u2019t tried it, but I did managed to absorb quite a bit of cold energy.\u201d Caught by surprised, Chu Yang answered, \u201cLet me try it out.\u201dWu Yun Liang and Meng Chao Ran went silent: What did you go in there for\u2026?Chu Yang activated his internal energy and pulled on the cold energy stored by Nine Tribulations Sword in his dantian. The stone cave immediately became as cold as a harsh winter day. When his right arm stretched out it became like a silvery ice pole.With one palm, icy air immediately poured out!Chu Yang only used three percent!Wu Yun Liang and Meng Chao Ran stared in shock!This\u2026 how could this be? This is level five of Seven Shades Absolute Saint Palm! This\u2026 this is really unimaginable! When he was using Seven Shades Absolute Saint Palm the other day, he was clearly not even level one!However, with this powerful cold energy, he seems to be at level five! This is the level of a master who cultivated for decades!If they realized that Chu Yang only used three percent of the cold energy, what would they think?The two rubbed their eyes simultaneously. Meng Chao Ran was shocked by his disciple, and quietly pinched Wu Yun Liang\u2019s thigh.Wu Yun Liang screamed in pain. It was a spot that was bruised earlier. Now that it was pinched, the pain was unbearable. He jumped holding his leg.\u201cSo it is not a dream.\u201d Meng Chao Ran laughed. He was extremely happy with his disciple\u2019s great accomplishment.\u201cYou!\u2026\u201d Wu Yun Liang looked angrily at Meng Chao Ran, \u201cYou don\u2019t have your own legs?\u201d\u201cI do.\u201d Meng Chao Ran answered casually, \u201cI just wanted to see if everything was real.\u201d\u201cBut you pinched my thigh!\u201d Wu Yun Liang yelled in anger.\u201cUs two martial brothers are so close. Pinching you or pinching me, what is the difference?\u201d Meng Chao Ran let out a hearty laugh and walked forward. He patted Chu Yang on the shoulder and praised, \u201cNot bad! You have made your master\u2019s face grow bigger!\u201dMeng Chao Ran has always been aloof; it was abnormal to see him joking around in such good spirit. However, in this moment, he was so happy he could not control his emotions. Even though Wu Yun Liang was acting angry, he was extremely happy to see his junior martial brother as he was when he first entered the sect. The same lively person was standing next to him\u2026 Wu Yun Liang also could not help but laugh out loud.\u201cSince you were able to absorb so much cold energy like that, I feel a little better about letting you go out there on your own.\u201d Meng Chao Ran smiled at Chu Yang, \u201cWhen you get to Iron Cloud you should still be very careful and remain low-keyed. You absolutely cannot be over-confident and get involved in the business of others. Especially, not the \u2018hero saving beauty\u2019 kind of thing\u2026 if you could avoid it, then don\u2019t do it! You should know that beauty is the source of disaster!\u201dChu Yang solemnly agreed.Meng Chao Ran\u2019s words were indeed valuable. The hero saves the beauty and the beauty repays the hero with special favors was what young men in Jiang Hu searched for. However, this was also how many martial artists got killed.Anyone that could bully a beauty in public would be a powerful character\u2026 if not himself, then his family would be powerful. Provoking such a person without anyone powerful backing you up, then it would be either death or exile in some distant land\u2026Chu Yang thought to himself, if I were still na\u00efve like those overconfident boys and idiotically got involved in other people\u2019s business\u2026 that would be a strange phenomenon.\u201cI still don\u2019t understand how you could have absorbed so much cold energy like that!\u201d Wu Yun Liang jumped in. His swollen eyes have now opened wide as he inspected Chu Yang, \u201cYou are only a Martial Warrior\u2026 Hack! Martial Warrior?\u201dChu Yang asked innocently with his eyes opened wide, \u201cWhat is the matter?\u201dSect Master Wu Yun Liang was confounded. His eyes opened so wide, his eyeballs almost fell to the floor\u2026 He clearly remembered that a few days ago Chu Yang was only a third grade Martial Pupil\u2026 How would he have become a Martial Warrior in a few days?This youth, how could there be so many strange phenomena surrounding him?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMoreover, if a first grade Martial Warrior absorbed that much cold energy, his meridians would have frozen and shattered to piece. How could he stand there so casually as if it was nothing?After staring at Chu Yang\u2019s innocent face for a long time, Wu Yun Liang rolled his eyes and gave up, \u201cFine, I will not ask anymore. I just hope you can continue your act and get into Iron Cloud. That would be good.\u201d\u201cThis disciple will not fail you.\u201d Chu Yang smiled sweetly. His face was full of kindness, honesty, and innocence.Wu Yun Liang was at a loss of words. He looked at the kind and honest face for a while, gritted his teeth and said, \u201cWhoever believe in this face of yours would be an idiot! If they believe in those \u2018honest\u2019 words\u2026 surely they would have been sold many times over.\u201dMeng Chao Ran laughed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He wanted to tell his teacher something, but he felt that no matter what he said, he would not be able to dispel Meng Chao Ran\u2019s fears. Therefore, Chu Yang remained silent as well.As teacher and student walked through the gate of Purple Bamboo Garden, they heard Tan Tan\u2019s ear-piercing screams, \u201cDon\u2019t escape! If you keep trying to escape, I will make soup out of you.\u201dThe two were stunned. They immediately ran in to see Tan Tan bending down by the pond with water splashing everywhere. Afterward, he suddenly cheered with satisfaction as he jumped up holding a fish over his head. He was overjoyed.Meng Chao Ran was shocked, and suddenly ran forward.Chu Yang was also amazed! He could not believe that Tan Tan was able to catch such a valuable thing!This was a strange fish. Its whole body was black without any scales. Its head was completely round without any eyes. It was a kind of fish without sight! The fish was not all that big, no more than half a pound in weight.\u201cTan Tan, drop it.\u201d Meng Chao Ran screamed, \u201cYou absolutely cannot kill it!\u201dTan Tan\u2019s face was full of confusion as he turned around. When he saw the person screaming was Meng Chao Ran, he exclaimed excitedly, \u201cMaster, Chu Yang, look, look\u2026 I just caught a really strange fish.\u201dTan Tan was still showing off when the fish sudden twisted violently and jumped from his hand. It drew a beautiful arch in the air as it was falling back into the pond.Meng Chao Ran\u2019s reaction was incredibly fast as he jumped and caught the fish in mid-air. After that, he immediately did a spin and landed back on the ground. Without a pause, there was a bucket in Meng Chao Ran\u2019s hand. He filled the bucket with water from the pond and placed the fish in it.When everything was done, he splashed water on his face and gave Tan Tan the bucket. He said with a smile, \u201cPut this in your room and take care of it carefully. This fish is extremely precious. You must never let it die.\u201dPuzzled, Tan Tan said, \u201cMaster, what kind of fish is this? It\u2019s so small\u2026 not even enough for soup.\u201d\u201cSoup?! You only think about food!\u201d Meng Chao Ran was annoyed and amused at the same time. He hit Tan Tan on the head and scolded, \u201cThis is a priceless treasure! Isn\u2019t it wasteful to just eat it?\u201d\u201cPriceless treasure?\u201d Tan Tan started to understand somewhat and looked at the fish curiously. Looking left and right, it was still just a fish. Even though its appearance was a little weird, it was still just a fish\u2026\u201cThis is the Heavenly Chi Gathering Fish.\u201d Chu Yang yelled out as he knelt down and looked at the looked at the fish carefully. \u201cI really can\u2019t believe\u2026 Tan Tan was able to find such a treasure! Such good luck.\u201d\u201cHeavenly Chi Gathering Fish?\u201dChu Yang gently replied, \u201cYes, Heavenly Chi Gathering Fish. According to ancient stories it was the Heavenly Three Star Clan\u2019s treasure. Before the fish matures, eating it will have no special effect. However, if you take care of this fish in your room it could gather the energy of heaven and earth all around it! This will help you multiply the effectiveness of your cultivation! This fish is a treasure that martial artists can only dream of!\u201d\u201cExactly, moreover, the best thing about this fish is when it is near, the energy gathered around it is extremely pure. This is its most valuable characteristic. This fish is the stuff of legends. For many years, no one has seen it; its description can only be found in books. Tan Tan, how did you find it?\u201d Meng Chao Ran asked in surprise.\u201cIt was just now. I went out to get some water from the pond when the sky suddenly darkened. I could not see anything at all. I was too scared to move so I just stayed still next to the edge of the pond. After about an hour, it started brighten. That was when I notice at a muddy area on the water\u2019s edge was moving as if something was trying to get out\u2026 I watched it carefully\u2026\u201d Tan Tan shrugged, \u201cAfterward, I saw the fish came out from the mud\u2026 I was curious about its strange appearance, so I grabbed it.\u201d\u201cThe sky suddenly became dark?\u201d Meng Chao Ran frowned\u2026 When the strange phenomenon happened, he and Wu Yun Liang was still underground so he did not know. Hearing this from Tan Tan, he found the whole thing really odd.\u201cThe sky became dark for an hour? After that, the fish came out from the mud?\u201d Meng Chao Ran looked up at the sky. There was a flash of worry, \u201cAll things relating to the Divine Clan have not appeared in this world for a very long time. Why did the Divine Chi Gathering Fish suddenly appeared? And why did the sky suddenly become dark when it was morning?\u201d\u201cPerhaps, there is going a big change?\u201d Meng Chao Ran thought for a while and finally gave up. But judging from his pinched brows, another worry had been added to his mind.Chu Yang was also confused. He did not know that the moment he obtained the Nine Tribulations Sword Tip, this monumental phenomenon happened.\u201cTan Tan, since you found the fish, you should keep it in your room.\u201d Meng Chao Ran had recovered his usual unaffected attitude.\u201cYes, master. Chu Yang and I share the same room so we can both benefit from this, ha ha.\u201d Tan Tan was really excited.\u201cStarting from today, you and Chu Yang will stay in separate rooms!\u201d Meng Chao Ran said with a somber face.\u201cWhy?\u201d Tan Tan asked disappointedly.\u201cThere are no issues. Chu Yang just has something important to take care of.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 then we should put the fish in Chu Yang\u2019s room.\u201d Tan Tan pleaded with extreme sadness, \u201cEven though I really need it, but Chu Yang is about to leave on a dangerous mission, he needs it more than me. Even if it will help him just a little, it would still be good. Even better, when Chu Yang leaves, he should take it with him so he can absorb energy from heaven and earth whenever he needs.\u201dChu Yang was touched. He turned around and looked at Tan Tan. A warm emotion surged up inside him. But he did not say anything for a long time.Meng Chao Ran already clearly explained what made the Heavenly Chi Gathering Fish so special. Even though Tan Tan can be simple at times, he was not dumb. He was not unclear on the matter. However, with a treasure like that and he adamantly wanted to give it away\u2026 he didn\u2019t even blink!This was something he wanted, but he still wanted to give it to me!\u201cWhy?\u201d Meng Chao Ran asked, his eyes full of admiration.\u201cI will be staying with you so there\u2019s no danger at all.\u201d Tan Tan said seriously, \u201cChu Yang needs it more than I do.\u201d\u201cSilly boy.\u201d Meng Chao Ran raised his hand and patted Tan Tan\u2019s head as he spoke, \u201cIf you want to help Chu Yang, you must first increase your own strength. That way, when he does need you, you can give him your greatest efforts. Chu Yang will be out and about; bringing this fish will only lead to danger. Do you understand?\u201dTan Tan\u2019s mouth opened wide. He stuttered, \u201cThen\u2026 then\u2026 then I will keep it here.\u201d Looking somewhat embarrassed, he turned to Chu Yang to explain, \u201cChu Yang, I\u2026 I am not stingy with you but this\u2026 is\u2026\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Chu Yang squeezed his shoulders and said sincerely, \u201cYou\u2019re a good brother!\u201d\u201cTan Tan, how did you know that I was leaving?\u201d Chu Yang asked.\u201cThese past few days, you have been preparing. You didn\u2019t say anything to me\u2026 I am not stupid\u2026 we grew up together\u2026 whenever you don\u2019t tell me about something, it usually is dangerous.\u201d Tan Tan huffed, \u201cPlus, these days, master clearly tried to be as close as possible to you. If I still don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, I would be an idiot.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euChu Yang laughed.With another huff, Tan Tan suddenly said sincerely, \u201cChu Yang, I don\u2019t know where you are going. But I will definitely work hard to cultivate and help you in the future.\u201d\u201cGood! I will wait for you. At that time, you and I will fight side by side to change this world!\u201d Chu Yang was filled with pride and let out a loud shout\u2026 He felt a surge of triumph.With such a good martial brother, how could I not work hard?

The two were essentially living in the same room for those three days. During this period, anything that Meng Chao Ran could think of, he immediately taught it to Chu Yang. Without any rest, he jammed into Chu Yang\u2019s head all of his experience in Jiang Hu, as well as all his tricks and tactics.Even though Chu Yang already knew most of these things, he enjoyed his teacher\u2019s attention and care. He listened to Meng Chao Ran\u2019s words earnestly\u2026 taking in all of the warmth in this short time period.Chu Yang never had the chance to enjoy such warm feelings from his teacher in his previous life. Therefore he did not want to miss anything. He knew that if he brushed off Meng Chao Ran\u2019s words, then he would not say anything, but on the inside, Meng Chao Ran would be annoyed.Chu Yang did not want to make his teacher unhappy.Three days passed by in an instant.On the last day, Chu Yang stepped out of his door, quietly watching the early morning mist lingering. He took in a deep breath, feeling full of nostalgia. Today was the day he must leave this place!With this journey, I don\u2019t know when I will be back\u2026 I don\u2019t even know if I can come back.There was a heavy rain last night and the entirety of Purple Bamboo Garden had been washed. The whole atmosphere was crisp and clean.Since early in the morning, Meng Chao Ran had left to pick some herbs in the mountain. Chu Yang knew his teacher was using it as an excuse to avoid the inevitable goodbye.Suddenly, there was a terrified scream from the toilet, followed by Tan Tan running out\u2026 He was covered with a strong stench, and his whole body was filthy beyond words.Chu Yang could not help but be surprised. Why was Tan Tan holding the Heavenly Chi Gathering Fish in his hand?Tan Tan\u2019s face was sad and shameful as he ran pass Chu Yang. He did not even look at Chu Yang as he ran into his room and plopped the Heavenly Chi Gathering Fish into the bucket.In the blink of an eye, a naked Tan Tan ran out. With a wooden bucket, he continually poured water all over his body. It took a few buckets before the stench started to wear off a little.Just now, Chu Yang was feeling sentimental about leaving, but this junior martial brother had made him utterly confused. This crazy guy, what is he doing? Did he just fall into the latrine so early in the morning?Tan Tan finally cleaned up, and in a flash, ran into his room. At the speed of light, he rolled up the dirty clothes and tossed it out.Afterward, Tan Tan came out with a funny looking smile on his face. His face was wrinkled like a bitter gourd, as he let out a long sigh (TLN: Bitter gourds are a common ingredient in Asian cuisine).\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Chu Yang squinted his eyes.\u201cAh, don\u2019t ask.\u201d Tan Tan cried as he answered.Since he got the Heavenly Chi Gathering Fish, Tan Tan treated it like a treasure. He put it in a corner of his room and carefully took care of it. Every now and then, he would feed it some food such as water plants and so on\u2026 However, yesterday, the fish floated with its white belly up in the bucket.Tan Tan kept touching it but the fish did not react at all\u2026 It continued to float belly-up in the bucket without any signs of life.When Tan Tan picked it up this morning, he discovered that the Heavenly Chi Gathering Fish has become stiff. With a sad sigh, he held the fish and cried. Unexpectedly, he had the urge to go to the bathroom, so he ran with the fish still in hand. He thought since the fish was dead, he might as well just toss it into the latrine.However, after he tossed it in, an unbelievable thing happened. That fiendish fish suddenly came to life and tried to escape with full vigor.Inevitably, Tan Tan had to jump in to catch the fish. Even worse\u2026 last night\u2019s heavy rain has made the latrine more full so Tan Tan had to take a swim in the toilet\u2026\u201cHahahaha\u2026\u201d After hearing his story, Chu Yang was clutching his stomach, laughing.Even in his dreams, he could never imagine his junior martial brother could do such an amusing thing.Tan Tan sighed. With a tragic countenance, he said bitterly, \u201cHow would I know that fiendish fish could act dead like that? It was living nicely in the bucket and then it just turned stiff. When I tossed it in the latrine, it became lively again. Does it have to live in stinky places?Chu Yang rubbed his stomach. With tears all over his face, he said, \u201cYou are such a fool. Heavenly Chi Gathering Fish absorbs the energy from heaven and earth. Once it is done, it become immobilized as it digest that energy. It does this before absorbing more. During this time of digestion, martial artists will also make use of some of the energy it absorbed for their cultivation! And you\u2026 you threw it in the latrine!\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d Tan Tan\u2019s mouth opened wide, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say it earlier?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a fool.\u201d Chu Yang said, \u201cThe Heavenly Chi Gathering Fish can still live if it was buried underground. Why would it die if it was living in a bucket of water? Use your thick head and think! Plus\u2026 it lives on the energy of heaven and earth, feeding it will do nothing! You tossed it in the latrines\u2026 You are really something. If others hear about you tossing a precious Heavenly Chi Gathering Fish into the latrines, all the martial artists would probably come and fight to the death with you!\u201dTan Tan sighed and said, \u201cI am already paying for it\u2026 My clothes is gone, and my hands\u2026\u201dHe raised his hands up to his nose and sniffed. The he immediately looked like he was going to retch, \u201cI need my hands to eat\u2026 What to do now?\u201d\u201cYou deserve it!\u201d Chu Yang teased. He could not help but laughed.Chu Yang went into the room and looked at the fish. The poor Heavenly Chi Gathering Fish was madly swimming back and forth, and every now and then, it jumped up. At the same time, it was spitting a lot of waste material. It seemed that the fish has suffered greatly\u2026\u201cHurry up and change the water!\u201d Chu Yang yelled.Tan Tan quickly did so. After seven or eight times, the Heavenly Chi Gathering Fish calmed down once again. It laid at the bottom with its belly puffing, clearly full of anguish\u2026It seemed that it needed a little more rest.Chu Yang could not believe that he would be laughing to tears upon his departure. It was not until he was a long distance off when he heard the scratchy voice of Tan Tan yelling after him, \u201cChu Yang, take care! I will come and find you! I will help you!\u201dIn that voice, the final sentences were also choked with sadness.Chu Yang paused for a second. Without turning around he waved his arm. He turned a corner and disappeared from Tan Tan\u2019s sight.\u201cYou must not die!\u201d Tan Tan yelled loudly. Along with that came a torrential downpour of tears. He fell to ground sobbing like a child who just lost his family.He did not know what Chu Yang was doing, but he was aware of the danger involved! Otherwise, their master would not have acted the way he did.Tan Tan was very worried and sad at the same time.Chu Yang heart was suffering a little as well, but he forced himself not to turn around. And just like that, he went further and further, step by step.In a distance on a mountain peak, Meng Chao Ran\u2019s whole body was bathed in morning\u2019s light. His eyes squinted as concentrated on his disciple\u2019s departing steps. He did not even noticed that his hands had formed into tight fists.In his right hand, there was a piece of paper. On it were words written by Chu Yang, \u201cWith Fleeting Snow Cloud Movement Technique, you need to bend your body down to reverse your internal flow. Then cultivate from the last step\u2026 You can only be successful if you cultivate in reverse.\u201dChu Yang\u2019s figure fluttered along the mountain path. On his back, there was only a small travel bag.Leaving Beyond the Heavens Sect all by himself, he was alone on a journey to face an uncertain fate. Chu Yang suddenly became a little melancholy.At that moment, his heart remembered these verses, \u201cOn this road, there is no fear of mountains of blades and oceans of fire\u2026 On this road, Jiang Hu has nine chance of death and one chance of life\u2026 On this road, we laugh at all under the heavens\u2026 On this road, straight to the Nine Heavens without turning back.\u201dThese words were from a very popular song from the previous life, called \u201cThe Road of Jiang Hu\u201d\u2026 Mo Qing Wu used to play music and sing this song; that was why Chu Yang had a deep impression of it.Thinking about it again, Chu Yang could not help but smiled. He muttered, \u201cOn this road, don\u2019t mind the heavens but fight it\u2026 On this road, let life escape fate\u2026 On this road, I will hold Qing Wu\u2019s hand and laugh at life\u2026 On this road, I will certainly overturn the Nine Heavens!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAnd like that he softly sung the lyrics he just created in addition to the song as walked out of the territory of Beyond the Heavens Sect, leaving the Nine Peaks, One Garden.He did not even look back.This youth with unruly hair covering half of his face. Hidden beneath this hair was an alert pair of eyes that was watching the whole world. His gaze was sharp like a knife; it looked as if it wanted to split the world in half.The rays of early morning light shined on him, stretching his shadow really far\u2026 in the middle of the foggy wilderness, his silhouette appeared like out of thin air, upon him there was an aura of shining crimson blood-red light\u2026As if it was a manifestation of something\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 46 \u2013 It Starts NowOn the main road, there was a slowly moving horse drawn carriage. In the front and back, there were eight icy-faced riders protecting it. The carriage\u2019s driver was an older gentlemen with peppered hair. With whip in hand, his eyes looked ahead with an indifferent expression. With each crack of the whip, the horses neighed and the carriage move forward leaving a trail of dust behind.Inside the carriage was an old man who was frowning as if he was thinking about something.This old man was praised as the world\u2019s top divine doctor of the time \u2013 Du Shi Qing. This time, he was going from Great Zhao Nation into Iron Cloud Nation!\u201cSenior Du, in this trip to Iron Cloud Nation, you have only a single mission. It is to use all of your saintly skills to help the emperor of Iron Cloud nation live a little bit longer. You must not let him die too early!\u201dThese words were solemnly said to him by Prime Minister Diwu Qing Rou, himself.Du Shi Qing already clearly understood why the emperor of Iron Cloud had to live a little longer. Currently, Iron Cloud was managed by the prince, but the prince was not the emperor. There were some things he still cannot legitimately carry out. (TLN: the phrase was \u2018if the name is not right, the words won\u2019t ring true\u2019 or something like that)As long as the emperor stretches out his last dying breath, Iron Cloud Nation would never be fortified! Even if Tie Bu Tian was overflowed with talent, he would not dare kill his dad and usurp the throne of Iron Cloud. Therefore he would not be able to change the current state of Iron Cloud.If Tie Shi Cheng can live for another month then Great Zhao Nation would have another month to prepare! It would be best if the old emperor kept his dying breath until everything was ready! When war breaks out, the prince of Iron Cloud Nation would not have full power and all the weaknesses would be left exposed.However, this task was extremely difficult!And only Du Shi Qing would know how difficult it was.Du Shi Qing smiled sadly and then sighed. Years ago when Tie Shi Cheng was still a young man, he went into the battlefield against Great Zhao Nation. At the time, Diwu Qing Rou was only a cabinet member with the responsibility of watching over the military. Yet he has the guts to use gold and silver to hire the best archer to kill Tie Shi Cheng.In the chaos of the battlefield, Tie Shi Cheng was shot by an arrow! Even worse, that arrow was covered in an extremely strong poison!Tie Shi Cheng was blocked by one of his guards. The arrow pierced through the guard\u2019s chest and went into Tie Shi Cheng\u2019s body so it potency was weakened. Even so, this poison almost took Tie Shi Cheng\u2019s life.It was Diwu Qing Rou who once again used money to buy Du Shi Qing\u2019s service for the nation. This service was healing Tie Shi Cheng\u2019s wound. In his whole life, Du Shi Qing finally did the one unethical thing: healing Tie Shi Cheng\u2019s wound, but secretly poisoning him with something of a more chronic nature, one without a cure.As poison slowly ate away Tie Shi Cheng\u2019s body, Great Zhao also gradually ate away Iron Cloud Nation all these years.Make him sick, but don\u2019t let him die. Even though, Iron Cloud could have been taken over, but he did not do it! These past years, Diwu Qing Rou used the conflict with Iron Cloud to repeatedly achieve merits for himself. He never ceased to increase his reputation. He never ceased to gain more power. Even within the military, Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s achievements shined brightest. And now, he was below only one and ruled over all.He always achieved merits in battle with Iron Cloud Nation but he kept Iron Cloud alive with just enough force to fight back! Diwu Qing Rou had turned Iron Cloud into a gold mine for his meritorious achievements. It was not until now that he had started his plan to completely take over Iron Cloud nation because he was at the peak of power! With Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s current influence, even the emperor of Great Zhao cannot do anything to him.Diwu Qing Rou was one of those people that used tactics and plots to the point of perfection!At this point, Tie Shi Cheng\u2019s body was beyond saving. The only thing that could be done now was to stretch out his dying breath. If it was not for the extremely talented prince, then Iron Cloud would easily become part of Great Zhao nation!\u201cI was the key that started this, and now I am the person to end it!\u201dDu Shi Qing sighed sadly!The road ahead was long\u2026**********************************************************Chu Yang stood alone on the mountain. Using the thick forest to cover his body, he quietly watched the riders from a distance.He rubbed his palms gently. Between them was a piece of paper with the following words, \u201cIron Cloud hired the world\u2019s top divine doctor, Du Shi Qing, to come to Iron Cloud Citadel. Nine days from now, they will pass by Evil Tiger Ridge!\u201dThe paper turned shreds and disintegrated in thin air!Without a pause, he shot through the trees and flew down the mountain.This was a strategy he has planned ahead! Du Shi Qing was a major key in it!If he wanted to go into Iron Cloud to invert fate, he cannot simply just do so. After arriving there, he has to become valuable to others. More importantly, they would have to trust him. With this trust, he would be able grasp control!How to achieve all these things in a short period of time? At the slowest, I will have to do in two years\u2019 time what a normal person would do in a lifetime!Chu Yang\u2019s mission cannot be considered easy! But he cannot turn around!Du Shi Qing was Chu Yang\u2019s first move!\u201cWhoa, whoa\u2026\u201dThe horses neighed and came to a stop. Before the carriage was a youth dressed in black. His handsome face was calm with a mix of excitement. His burning gaze was directed at the carriage.\u201cWho are you?!\u201d The eight guards stopped their horses simultaneously. Three swords and five sabers also came out of their sheaths at the same time.\u201cIs the person in the carriage the world\u2019s top doctor, the one people called Compassionate Saint Du Shi Qing, elder Du?\u201dThe black outfitted youth\u2019s eyes were full of excitement as well as gratitude and reverence as he tried to look inside the carriage. It was as if he did not pay any attention to the glistening swords and sabers that were surrounding him!\u201cWho are you?\u201d The leader asked as he looked at the youth with a gaze as sharp as that of a falcon, remaining ever vigilante! At the same time, the other guards pointed their weapons in the direction of the youth as they quietly spread out in four directions around the carriage.\u201cIs it?\u201d The youth took a step forward, showing great urgency!\u201cThat is none of your business. Back off now!\u201d The leader said coldly. He did not think that this youth has any malicious intents, but this trip was extremely important, he could not be too careful.\u201cIf it is indeed Senior Du, please come out and meet me!\u201d The youth did not concede.\u201cFoolish!\u201d There sabers, white as snow, slashed toward him.The youth in black acted as if he was momentarily surprised, and then he suddenly showed signs of anger. His body quickly swerved left and right to avoid the sabers. The sabers were everywhere but he continued to move safely between them. All of a sudden, his hands became like claws and went forward.One of the sabers fell to the ground. The leader felt his wrist go numb. With his saber almost fallen to the ground as well, he could not help but be surprised. He dismounted and yelled, \u201cInto formation against the enemy!\u201dThe other seven guards dismounted at once and went into battle formation. The weapons seemed as if they have awoken.\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Du Shi Qing yelled from inside the carriage. Immediately after, he calmly said, \u201cYoung master, I am Du Shi Qing. Why do you wish to see me?\u201dWhen he was done talking, he lifted the curtain and revealed himself.\u201cSenior Du, be careful! This person is of unknown origin and has unclear intentions.\u201d Two guards immediately raised their swords and covered the front of the carriage. They were ready for combat.\u201cSure enough, it is divine doctor Du!\u201d The black-outfitted youth\u2019s face flushed with excitement. Without heeding the swords and sabers in front him, he slowly walked forward with his eyes focused on Du Shi Qing.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter two steps, this youth came into contact with the leader\u2019s saber. The latter had no intention of pulling back and continued to press his saber forward.The youth felt the tingling pain of the saber\u2019s stab, and looked down. He smiled in embarrassment and suddenly bowed down in front of Du Shi Qing.His strange action surprised everyone.\u201cSenior Du, do you remember when you went by here eight years ago? There was war between the two countries at the time and all was in chaos. You benevolently saved a mountain couple. Do you remember?\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Du Shi Qing frowned as he try to think. In his life, he has saved millions. How could he remember everyone? However, he clearly remembered that he really did come by here eight years ago.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And even more, you gave them a tael of silver before you left! My family has never forgotten your great kindness!\u201dWhen the black-outfitted youth saw that Du Shi Qing was still contemplating, his face lit up and his voice became even more excited, \u201cAt the time, my parents were not well off, our family\u2019s living situation was grim. We depended entirely on the tael of silver Senior Du gave us to keep going. To my family, Senior Du\u2019s kindness was as great as heaven and earth.\u201cI see.\u201d Du Shi Qing seemed to vaguely remember a few events like that, but his memory was foggy and he has no deep impression of any of it. It would seem that he only remembered because the other reminded him. He has treated countless people in his lifetime, even if such a thing was in his memory, it would probably be blurred.However, this type of highway gratitude was indeed rare; at the least, it would make anyone feel very happy.\u201cYes, my late father reminded me about this matter many times. He said that when I grew up, I must find Senior Du and repay this kindness. Before my father passed away, he lamented over that fact that he could not repay Senior Du\u2019s kindness\u2026\u201dThe black-outfitted youth said in tears, \u201cThank the heavens, I have finally found Senior Du. Moreover, you have agreed to see me so I could show my gratitude\u2026 My late father, in heaven, would certainly be happy to know this.\u201dHe talked and cried. Within moments, his eyes were red.\u201cIt\u2019s enough, that I know of the gratitude of your father and you.\u201dDu Shi Qing also could not help but felt a little emotional, he said, \u201cThe past is the past\u2026 Now\u2026 oh, your father already\u2026 pass away?\u201d\u201cYes, three years ago he met with an unfortunate fate when he was hunting tigers in the mountain\u2026\u201d The youth in black said hoarsely.\u201cThat\u2019s regrettable\u2026 Your father was heroic! A good man\u2026\u201dIn truth, Du Shi Qing currently did not remember who it was, but he pieced together the words of the other person. He figured it was a poor father who was saved by him and had not forgotten that act of kindness. This father had asked his son to find a way to repay the doctor. In fact, even on his death bed, he did not forget about it. In addition, the words \u201chunting tigers\u201d\u2026, someone who dared to fight tigers would surely be a heroic figure.Such a person would have surely been a good person.Out of thin air, Du Shi Qing also felt he has indeed done this good deed. Even though his memory was foggy, this youth was so young and still showed him such gratitude. This surely could not be a lie.\u201cSenior Du finally remembers!\u201d The youth in black yelled in excitement, \u201cMy name is Chu Yang. That year, I also saw Senior Du!\u201d\u201cHow time passed. You are now grown up!\u201d Du Shi Qing rubbed his beard and smiled. He felt that his skepticism was misplaced. Moreover, he felt as if he just met the child of an old friend and immediately sighed, \u201cIf your father could see your abilities today, he would surely be very happy in heaven.\u201d\u201cYes. I started studying martial arts with my master six years ago\u2026\u201d Chu Yang said hesitantly. With a look of embarrassment, he stuttered, \u201cHack, hack\u2026, I finally come face to face with Senior Du today. I also learned that Senior Du is travelling a very long distance to Iron Cloud. Even though my abilities are limited, I would like to help escort Senior Du. I promise to do everything in my power to help you.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that\u2026\u201d Du Shi Qing said with some hesitation.\u201cWill Senior Du not give me even one chance to repay your kindness?\u201d Chu Yang said sadly, \u201cI know my skills are lacking, but\u2026 it is my wish. I also want to fulfill my father\u2019s last dying wish. I beseech Senior Du to allow me to do this!\u201dAfter Chu Yang said this, it seemed that no one had any doubts left. The eight guards also changed their attitude toward Chu Yang. One of the guards vigorously patted Chu Yang\u2019s shoulder, smiled and said, \u201cDear boy, your skills are lacking? The three of us couldn\u2019t stop you.\u201dChu Yang humbly said, \u201cThat was because you went easy on me. You saw that I was young and did not want to use your full force. Otherwise, I would have been chopped in half already.\u201dAll of the guards laughed.Even though they all knew that they certainly did not go easy on him earlier, but the fact that they did not go all out was true. They quite liked this bright and tactful youth.He did not forget the kindness of others; he persisted on fulfilling his father\u2019s dying wish; he was perseverant\u2026 Someone who was faithful and filial like this would be welcomed everywhere he went.\u201cWell, if you insist on it, you can follow me. Wait until we get to Iron Cloud, I will find you some good opportunities if I have a chance. That would be good.\u201d Du Shi Qing smiled.The eight guards also smiled happily. With Du Shi Qing\u2019s referral, especially given Iron Cloud\u2019s current need of him, nothing would be difficult! It could be said that Du Shi Qing only needed to open his mouth and this youth would have a bright future!\u201cI dare not. I do not have any interest in fame and glory.\u201d Chu Yang said quietly, revealing a faint dissatisfaction, \u201cOnce Senior Du is safe in Iron Cloud, I will be assured and leave. Even though this little person (TLN: \u201cI\u201d in a humbled manner, as opposed to a great person) has no accomplishments, but those things, hahaha\u2026 It is best to stay away just to be safe. I want to avoid losing my head unexpectedly.\u201dHow could Chu Yang not know this was Du Shi Qing\u2019s last test? That was why he put on a show of hating fame and fortune. He also pretended to hide his dissatisfaction with such things\u2026When Chu Yang finished even the carriage driver\u2019s face became a little eased. Du Shi Qing shook his head and laughed, \u201cGood\u2026 In that case, follow me.\u201dChu Yang expression went from grief to joy. He jumped up excitedly, \u201cThank you, Senior Du!\u201dMeeting such a pure and honest youth, Du Shi Qing laughed freely. He did not know that this \u201cgood, kind, honest, filial, faithful\u2026\u201d guy who was just talking was actually trying to hold down the urge to vomit\u2026 (TLN: from his act)Du Shi Qing did not even think that this \u201crepayment of kindness\u2026, fulfill my father\u2019s last dying wish\u2026\u201d was all a big lie. Chu Yang did not even know his own origin, let alone the rest.Regardless, the first step in Chu Yang\u2019s plan was successful. He had managed to infiltrate this group, and this group had access to the highest level power of Iron Cloud Nation.Chu Yang naturally has additional plans, but this group was the key to everything. As long as Du Shi Qing\u2019s poisoning of Tie Shi Cheng was not uncovered, he would still be of great importance to Tie Bu Tian. (TLN: So I was wrong, Chu Yang did know about the poisoning\u2026)Once Du Shi Qing\u2019s group has a deep impression of him, this important step could be considered nicely completed.He originally thought to change his appearance, but, after thinking it over, he felt his body would still leave signs that could be discovered. That would not be good. It was easier to just use his true identity to enter Iron Cloud Nation.The identity of an expelled disciple of Beyond the Heavens Sect \u2013 Chu Yang!After just one day, Chu Yang had become close to the eight guards. They ate and drink together happily. However, Chu Yang still felt as if there was a sharp gaze constantly watching him. He knew that this gaze belonged to the driver of the carriage.Even though he did not know that person\u2019s martial art skill, but there was something hidden. He was definitely not an ordinary old man. Compared to the martial uncles at Beyond the Heavens Sect, he was probably not weaker.He was the real protector of Du Shi Qing. Only this person was needed to beat a thousand soldiers and ten thousands horses (TLN: a mighty force).Du Shi Qing and the eight guards had no suspicions toward him. It was only the carriage driver that never trusted him completely.Two days later, the group came into a town in the afternoon. They finally heard a rumor: \u201cBeyond the Heavens Sect has announced that the disciple Chu Yang of Purple Bamboo Garden had misconducted himself and killed his elder martial brother Shi Qian Shan. Because of this heinous crime, he was expelled from the sect! From now on, he is no longer a disciple of Beyond the Heavens Sect!\u201dWhen they heard the news, Du Shi Qing\u2019s group was extremely surprised.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cChu Yang, the Chu Yang they are talking about\u2026 Is that you?\u201dChu Yang\u2019s face fell. It became gloomy and full of unspoken grievances. His eyes became dazed, empty and confused.\u201cWhat happened? How did you get expelled from the sect?\u201d Du Shi Qing frowned, \u201cWith your personality, such a thing just cannot be!\u201dChu Yang\u2019s face became cold. His hands seemed to unconsciously crush a piece of grass in his hand. A little while later, he grinded his teeth and said, \u201cMy martial sister\u2026 my martial sister\u2026 we were engaged\u2026 but\u2026\u201dHe did not finish his sentence. In fact, his explanation has no head or tail. But the expression of pain on his face and his trembling hands full of bulging veins already said everything. His appearance was more effective than any verbal explanation\u2026 (TLN: yep, really someone give him an Oscar\u2026)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They seemed to understand everything and looked at Chu Yang with sympathetic eyes.This using the sword (TLN: force) to win in love was just all too common. What was worse was it happened between martial brothers. There were really no words for that.In addition to that, Chu Yang showed a miserable face of a person who was in a lot of pain. He held his head with his hands and curled himself up. His ten fingers grabbed his hair and even managed to pull out some\u2026 With just a glance, one could tell that he was in indescribable pain\u2026\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Du Shi Qing sighed and said with great emphasis, \u201cThis story, no one is allowed to bring it up again.\u201dThe eight guards concurred.Even the carriage driver softened his gaze on Chu Yang after this\u2026 No wonder this youth appeared to be hopeless and even tried to cover up his martial arts training the other day.\u201cThank you.\u201d Chu Yang took a deep bow and said with a hoarse and painful tone, \u201cI only need to fulfill my late father\u2019s dying wish to repay senior Du\u2019s great kindness, then I will immediately disappear from this world\u2026 haha, from then on, I will live in solitary in the wilderness.\u201d\u201cA man of honor, there\u2019s no worry about finding a wife.\u201d Du Shi Qing patted his shoulder and consoled him, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t think too much of it.\u201dChu Yang nodded with great burden. He then sighed and stopped talking\u2026 As if there was an affliction in his heart that was difficult to solve.After this, everyone\u2019s attitude toward Chu Yang was much kinder. They seemed to even become more intimate. Loving, grateful, filial, humble\u2026 Such personality was rare in a youth\u2026Chu Yang\u2019s performance had won over these people completely. Even he did not know that a few acts could have instantly gained him that much advantage.The leader of the guards even sighed and patted Chu Yang on the shoulder, \u201cJunior martial brother, you should not be like this anymore. You need to let loose a little. You\u2019re a man\u2026 you need to widen your horizon\u2026 You only need money; there are plenty of pretty girls in the brothels.\u201dChu Yang \u2018sadly\u2019 nodded. He looked up and let out a \u2018forced\u2019 smile that was even worse to look at than his crying face\u2026Even though the others did not say anything, their gaze on Chu Yang had softened much. A victim of injustice\u2026 no matter in what time period, always got people\u2019s sympathy.The carriage driver did not bother to hang out with everyone else and just sat with the horses. Then with a deep sigh, he nonchalantly go up on his feet and tapped his tobacco pipe knocking the ashes to the ground. The eyes that could see through everything so clearly seemed to be lost in thought.Meanwhile Chu Yang was sighing on the outside, he knew that he has passed this Du Shi Qing hurdle.Now the only thing left to worry about was how to proceed once he arrived at Iron Cloud Nation.A bunch of old foxes already well-seasoned with politics at Iron Cloud Nation would not be as easy to fool as Du Shi Qing.Du Shi Qing lived his whole life as a miracle doctor. It was said any type of illness would have to retreat under his healing hands. However, he was still just a doctor with extraordinary medical skill. People might have respect for him for that\u2026 as for social interactions, he was probably not that great.And Chu Yang also knew that a few years from now, Du Shi Qing\u2019s reputation would be ruined because of this trip to Iron Cloud Nation. At that time, for some unknown reasons, the illness of Iron Cloud Nation\u2019s king was discovered to be caused by Du Shi Qing\u2019s poisoning a few years back.This caused an uproar over the entire Lower Three Heavens.Because of this discovery Du Shi Qing was criticized by heroes from all over. After admitting it was done by him, he felt ashamed and committed suicide! A whole life of healing and helping others turned to dust just like that.Perhaps it was a one-time mistake, or perhaps there was some hidden reasons\u2026 but what\u2019s done is done.Chu Yang did not have any special feelings for Du Shi Qing so he did not have any regrets in deceiving and using him. He did not feel any guilt either\u2026 But in the past few days Chu Yang did come to realize that this doctor was especially talented and was truly not a bad person.Perhaps when the two countries come into conflicts, each person will have their own master.After all, he was a citizen of Great Zhao. In the end, his skills was only used as a sacrifice, a tool for Diwu Qing Rou to appease the people after he conquered Iron Cloud Nation\u2026As for the eight guards, after careful observations, Chu Yang was finally sure that none of them belonged to the Golden Horse Rider Department!From the look of it, these eight were essentially Martial Warriors without any sort of deep cultivation. Additionally, their cultivation was really not all that high. All of them were probably only grade five or six Martial Warriors.Such guards were more than enough if they were to encounter small time robbers, but they would not do if they were to encounter martial masters. It seemed that they were only for show. The only real master was the carriage driver.Maybe Du Shi Qing was also a martial expert\u2026 but, in both the previous life and this, Chu Yang had never heard anyone talk of this divine doctor\u2019s martial skills.\u201cChu Yang, how old are you?\u201d While Chu Yang was quietly contemplating, the mysterious carriage driver still holding the tobacco pipe came over next to him and asked.\u201cSixteen.\u201d Chu Yang was currently afraid to talk about his life because that suffering was all an act. If he talked too much, something might be revealed. What would he do then?\u201cAh, sixteen\u2026 It seems that you learned about love very early.\u201d The old man revealed a vile smile, showing two rows of yellow teeth that glistened under the light of the fire. There was a sudden flash in his gaze that made Chu Yang immediately sensed that this man was not coming over for a friendly chat with him.\u201cWell, this kind of thing cannot really be clearly explained. Even for myself it still seems hazy right now.\u201d Chu Yang sighed and said sadly, \u201cIn life, there are many things that always seem ordinary, but when they are lost, they become engraved in your heart\u2026 hahaha.\u201d (TLN: Thanks to Trent for coming up with ordinary. Basically something that is really calm and tranquil that is ever present and something you take for granted).\u201cWell said.\u201d After hearing these words the old man became quiet for a long time. Then with a faint smile, he said, \u201cAlways seeming really ordinary is how they get engraved in your heart. It\u2019s not early anymore\u2026 you should go to sleep.\u201dAfter the man finished these words, he sat down by the fire and started to poke at the flame without saying another word. The fire danced and shined on his dull eyes, and, every now and then, those eyes shined hypnotically.Chu Yang was a little surprised. This was supposed to be the old man\u2019s final test for him. Chu Yang was sure of it\u2026 but he only said one sentence like that. Why did the old man just let it go?After careful contemplation, Chu Yang sighed. The phrase \u201calways staying really quiet is how they get engraved in your heart\u201d was not something he said casually.In his previous life, he and Mo Qing Wu went faced many things that would scare the heavens and shock the earth, but it was not until after Mo Qing Wu died that the faint memories started to surround him. What still stayed with him were the warm and ordinary things, the quiet memories\u2026None of those\u2026 extraordinary things!People, who doesn\u2019t have a youth?\u201cPeople, who doesn\u2019t have a youth\u2026\u201d Chu Yang was just thinking of this when he suddenly heard the voice of the old man echoed his thought. He could not believe that they were thinking about the same thing\u2026 Surprise, he looked over to find the old man looking at him. Their gazes showed a little empathy for each other.\u201cManager Gao, you should stop dreaming about your youth. You have already reached your winter a long time ago (TLN: old).\u201d The leader of the guards took a wine skin as he laughed loudly. Then he raised and poured wine into his mouth.The seven other guards suddenly burst into laughter.Manager Gao man snorted. Suddenly, the tobacco pipe flared up and a tiny spark flew out. It went straight for the wineskin that was just left the guard\u2019s mouth.There was still more than half of the wineskin left, but that little faint spark fell in to it and a half meter tall flame burst up. The leader of the guard was caught by surprise and lost more than half of his facial hair. A burnt smell momentarily filled the surroundings.The guard could not control himself and roared, \u201cManager Gao, you\u2019re serious?\u201dManager Gao snorted, and slowly walked away with his tobacco pipe.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe leader of the guard spat on the ground and angrily watched the manager but did not dare say anything else.Chu Yang\u2019s gaze suddenly shrunk. He watched the outline of the manager Gao\u2019s stooped back as walked away. A sense of fear rose up inside him.His move seemed simple at first glance, but Chu Yang knew that it was extremely difficult. The wine skin must have been 3-4 jins (TL: jin = a pound~ish). Even if it were thrown at a torch, the torch would have been extinguished, let alone a little weak spark. (TLN: Today, I learned that wine is not flammable. It is almost like water.)This move required gaze power, precise timing, and power to support it all\u2026 But these were not what Chu Yang was most concerned with. What he was most concerned about was: there was clearly fire control power behind it! Without the power to control fire then it simply cannot be done! However, the power to control fire\u2026 This belonged to the divine clan!Could he be from that divine clan?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Was there some mystery to this bodyguard of Du Shi Qing?Moreover\u2026 This road was too quiet.While Chu Yang was contemplating, Nine Tribulation Sword Spirit in his dantian fiercely jumped up. A sense of extreme danger rose up inside him. Within moments his hair was standing on ends. His gaze quickly became cold. He did not bother turning his head around to look. His body spun and rolled and immediately shot up high in the air\u2026 One moment he was next to the fire, and the next he was behind a tree. The whole process was so extraordinary that those watching would not believe their eyes.Suddenly, there was a sharp whistling sound, and a large boulder, a few meters wide, flew down from above. It was flying straight toward Du Shi Qing with exact precision!Du Shi Qing was right in the center of the boulder\u2019s lethal target!Manager Gao roared and his old man\u2019s body suddenly became powerful like a leopard\u2019s. It quickly shot forward\u2026 but it could be seen that he would not be in time to save Du Shi Qing\u2026 at that moment, Chu Yang mysteriously appeared next to that large boulder. A sword suddenly appeared in his hand. It shot out like a snake going attacking its victim.The sword\u2019s point flew like a dragon and stabbed into the side of the boulder.D\u2026E\u2026N\u2026G\u2026G!The stone was originally spinning intensely forward, but this extremely accurate stab into its exact weak spot\u2026 finally managed to slow down its speed a little.Like a big mountain quietly and suddenly falling on a sharp pivot point, this mysterious scene was difficult to put in words.This large boulder\u2019s reaction presented itself in a blink of an eye. It seemed as if Chu Yang\u2019s chest was hit by the boulder\u2026 Blood sprayed out from his mouth as he rolled back.However, he had managed to buy a little time! It was insignificant, only a blink of an eye\u2026But only that blink of an eye was needed for manager Gao to, as quick as a bolt of lightning, appear between Du Shi Qing and the big boulder\u2026 He let out an angry roar, followed by an invisible punch. The only thing that could be seen was a bright white flash around his fist. That extremely heavy stone shattered; the little broken pieces poured down like rain!Du Shi Qing was safe and sound!Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh\u2026Arrows poured down from the mountain\u2019s peak. They enveloped the group in all directions.\u201cFormation! Face the enemies!\u201d The leader of the guards yelled. The eight systematically and quickly rolled on the ground to their horses. Within a second, each of them was holding a round shield. Even though their reaction was relative fast, one of the guards was shot on his shoulder and calf. The tip of the arrows pierced through the body and brought with them pieces of meat and blood as they quickly disappeared in the dark night.He let out a painful scream. The other guards took three shields to cover him.Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh\u2026 the sounds started again. Hundreds of arrows rained down like an iron curtain in the air.THUNK THUNK\u2026 The arrows landed on the ground. The entire area of more than a hundred square meters became a giant hedgehog!Manager Gao let out a wail as his body spun like a dark cyclone. With his hands, he caught the dozens of arrows that were still in the air. He tossed them like dozens of black lightning bolts flying back in the opposite direction\u2026 He did not even bother to look at the result. Without pause, he grabbed Du Shi Qing. His body was but a flash as he went over to the carriage and quickly put Du Shi Qing inside.THWISH, THWISH\u2026 sounds rang up. Arrows then immediately appeared with a new target, the carriage. The sheer massive force caused the entire carriage to shake\u2026 but none of the arrows could pierce it!This carriage, as it turned out, was not ordinary!In the middle of the mountain, there were the \u201cTHUNK, THUNK\u2026.\u201d sounds in the direction that manager Gao had just sent back some of the arrows. These were the sounds of arrows landing on tree trunks\u2026 every now and then, they were interrupted by short screams.Manager Gao came back within a second. His face was pale; his first reaction was not to advance and kill the enemies\u2026 He glanced at Chu Yang. He was the only one there that knew how difficult Chu Yang\u2019s previous sword move was.If it was not for that incredible sword move, then this trip would have been disastrous!In terms of timing, position, power, and even the starting point from the beginning\u2026 all was perfect beyond belief! That sword move was simply saintly!This youth was only a Martial Warrior. Even a Martial Master at peak level could not do anything to such a large falling boulder with just a sword\u2026 It was unbelievable that Chu Yang could have used a sword to slow it down!Even though it was only for a blink of an eye, it was able to turn tables!After that incredible move, the ordinary sword was astonishingly undamaged. And the price he paid was only a little blood! This was simply unimaginable!The timing of the enemies\u2019 attack was extremely strange. They were currently in the territory of Iron Cloud\u2026 before this, they were unbothered on the road. It was unexpected that they would be attack here\u2026 Moreover, the enemies did not wait until midnight, but chose to initiate early in the evening like this!Everything happened so unexpectedly that it would make people feel as if the attackers were a group of robbers on the run and suddenly happened upon this opportunity. It was as if this was simply an impromptu decision. Even Manager Gao, who has been in Jiang Hu all his life, was caught unprepared!However, Chu Yang was able to do his sword move, within a moment of chaos! A sword move full of miraculous aura. It was almost like he has practiced this a thousand times already!Manager Gao was sure that no one would have practiced for such thing. It was not a coincidence, but it was not pre-planned either!When he looked over at the place where Chu Yang has just fallen, he discovered that the kid who just spit out blood and fell to the ground was nowhere to be seen!The eight guards formed a defensive position and slowly moved toward the carriage and dispersed around to fortify it.Manager Gao wanted to rush in and kill the enemies, but he stopped after some thoughts. Instead he stayed put and directed for the carriage to be slowly moved back away from the forest. The two horses that pulled the carriage earlier have already been turned into hedgehogs, and half of the guards\u2019 horses have also been killed.Manager Gao\u2019s body shook as he stood in place. The only sounds that were heard were repeated THUD THUD as each horse\u2019s body was tossed on top of each other\u2026 In an extremely short period of time, the dead horses became a wall of meat to block them from the view of those in the forest. Afterward, he crossed his arms across his chest. With full alertness, he looked around all four directions. And then step by step, he backed away.Their job was to keep Du Shi Qing safe, not kill the enemies!While he was doing these things, the hidden enemies, surprisingly, did not show the slightest of reaction!The attackers did not make a sound! With the exception of the two screams from earlier, they were like mimes.The arrows have stopped! All was completely quiet as if the earlier incident never happened at all. From extremely intense to extremely quiet, there was no buffer in between.When the arrows had quieted, twilight seized this opportunity to blanket its darkness over the ground! Between heaven and earth, there was suddenly filled with a stifling aura. It was so oppressive that one could barely breathe normally.The next time the enemies attack, it would definitely not be a few simple moves like what just happened. This was clear enough to everyone!Who were the enemies? What side did they belong to? Was it Great Zhao? Iron Cloud? Or was it Limitless Nation? Or was it\u2026 another power? Everything was hidden in a hazy fog.Regardless of which side they belonged to, this was definitely premeditated!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt was not until the group moved back by about ten meters that there was a reaction from the forest. After a series of strange sounds, a sharp whistling sound rose up. A long black shadow like a screaming, angry dragon flew out of the forest and broke through the curtain of the night. It brought with it an overwhelming presence and could not be blocked. In the blink of an eye, it would reach the carriage!The long shadow was like a tyrannical force that leaves everything trembling in its wake!It was only an arrow!However, shockingly, the shaft of this arrow was three meters long. It was filled with the smell of death as if it had been shot out from hell! It ripped through the night as it headed for the carriage!The tip of the arrow was heading straight for the central compartment. Without a doubt, it would not spare anyone in the carriage!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He fiercely punched and sent the flame forward!Control of fire!\u201cBang\u2026!\u201dImmediately after contact with the fire, from that gigantic dark arrow that looked like a black dragon, there were sparks flying everywhere!However, that arrow did not stop at all and continued to head straight forward!After that first punch, manager Gao continued to roar and produced eighteen consecutive punches. With every punch there was that same strange fire power fiercely hitting the siege crossbow\u2019s arrow!Like a hammering black smith, he did not cease his attack on that giant arrow. But the reverse could also be said; that arrow was doing the hammering on manager Gao\u2019s fist!There was an incredible radiance spread out in all four directions in the sky. In the dark night, there seemed as if thousands of fireworks were blooming brightly!Little wood pieces fell all around him. With each punch, manager Gao roared loudly. With eighteen punches, his eighteen roars filled the whole surrounding. When the arrow was shot out from the siege crossbow it was three meters long. It was now only one meter.Manager Gao was shocked; he had continuously retreated a few steps back and found himself against the carriage! The siege crossbow\u2019s arrow that was right in front of him finally lost its momentum, and dropped heavily on the ground.The air was filled with the smell of burnt things and smoke.Manager Gao\u2019s chest was rising and falling rapidly as he looked fiercely at the forest. A second later, he spit out some fresh blood. As the blood came out, his face also turned red. After a few moments, his normal color returned and his breathing normalized.He never would have thought that the enemies would set up a siege crossbow in a place like this. Because he was caught by surprise, no matter what his cultivation level was, he still took on some internal injuries when he dealt with the siege crossbow\u2019s arrow!The siege crossbow was a military weapon used to break down citadels\u2019 gates. The arrows were more than three meters long! They were made from Black Iron tree trunks with sharp and pointy metal tips. These arrows were normally soaked in oil vats and only taken out right before use.To shoot each arrow, there had to be at least one hundred strong men working in a concerted effort to pull the giant bow. Only then they would have the ability to release this powerful arrow that can determine the outcomes of wars!Siege crossbows were incredibly powerful; once they were used, citadels would undoubtedly be broken.After a moment of silence, a voice rang out from the forest. It was filled with praise, \u201cYou really live up to the title Fire Saber Great Master; you\u2019re truly amazing. One siege crossbow arrow can bring down a citadel gate, but you single-handedly brought it down. Much respect! Much respect!\u201dWith that voice, eight people simultaneously appeared from different locations. They all wore black masks, only their cold, sharp eyes were visible. Step by step, they walked toward manager Gao.Manager Gao\u2019s eyes narrowed as he asked in a low voice, \u201cWho are you people?\u201dOne of them grunted coldly and said, \u201cRumors has it that Fire Saber Great Master, Gao Wei Cheng, had retired from Jiang Hu. I did not think it was a lie. A Saber Great Master working as someone\u2019s body guard, accepting the easy life of a lapdog. I really envy you! Gao Wei Cheng, where is your saber?\u201dManager Gao was startled. His body suddenly perked forward. His slightly hunched posture suddenly became straight and tall. His eyes brightened as he spoke coldly, \u201cIf you already knew I am Gao Wei Cheng, then, surely, you are not a no name either. Let me see who you are!\u201dHe yelled out the sentence \u201cLet me see who you are!\u201d His roar was loud enough to shake the whole forest.The other person did not budge even a little. He stood there and said nonchalantly, \u201cGao Wei Cheng, if you take Du Shi Qing and turn around, we will not pursue you any further! Otherwise, today will be the day you, Fire Saber Great Master, dies!\u201dManager Gao tilted his head up and laughed, \u201cSuch bravado, let\u2019s see how you people plan to hold this old man!\u201dOne of the black-outfitted person mocked, \u201cFire Saber Great Master? Is that so great?\u201dThen he suddenly yelled, \u201cEveryone forward! Six people to Gao Wei Cheng, the other two kill Du Shi Qing!\u201dThe eight complied and simultaneously unsheathed their weapons and advanced.Manager Gao saw early on that these people did not necessarily have high cultivation level, but they were all about equal, probably Martial Master level. Even though their cultivation was a long stride below him, their current simultaneous advancement made them a powerful force!\u201cYou are Iron Cloud Nation\u2019s military?\u201d Seeing the enemies\u2019 incredible momentum, one that martial artists of higher level could not replicate, Manager Gao was shocked.The enemies did not bother to reply. Six sabers simultaneous slashed in the blink of an eye.Manager Gao yelled, \u201cProtect the carriage!\u201d At the same time, his wrist quickly turned out. A great saber with a dark red color appeared. It drew a screen in the air as thick as rain; only, this rain screen was filled flames bursting everywhere.\u201cDeng\u2026 Deng\u2026 Deng\u2026\u201dThe sounds of weapons clashing rang without end. In a flash, there were seven people in fierce combat without any reservations. The other two did not bother to pay any attention to that battle. At this same time, they rushed to the carriage with swords in hands.If there were no constraints, Manager Gao would have taken his time and killed each of these guys one by one. However, it is impossible to kill them all at once.Furthermore, after his dealing with the siege crossbow\u2019s arrow, he had suffered from internal injuries, rendering him even more powerless!At this moment, six enemies surrounded him. The eight guards did not have the ability to deal with the other two. Manager Gao could not help but feel anxious!**********************************************************Since the moment the siege crossbow made that shot, Chu Yang disappeared, without a trace, into the forest!He was like a wolf returning to the grassland, his home territory.After that first weapon struck, he immediately turned and shot himself back. He spit out a clump of fresh blood to help alleviate the shock to his internal system. Immediately after, his two legs stomped hard on the ground, creating a cloud of dust. Using the low-lying cloud of dust to cover his body, he stayed low to ground and moved like a snake. With a few movements, he was now hidden behind a large tree. Finally, his body moved in a mysterious manner. From the ground he climbed up to the tree top. Using leaves as cover, he continued to jump through more than a dozen trees and disappeared into the forest.The movements were smooth like a breeze weaving through the forest. Chu Yang\u2019s body was so agile that the leaves did not even move.Even if the best of assassins were to see Chu Yang\u2019s actions at this time, their eyes would probably drop out of their sockets!This was the best route that Chu Yang had chosen early on. In fact, he had planned it long before the attack. No matter where the resting place was, it was his habit to plan beforehand a route to retreat and a route to attack. Where he was standing now was between these two paths.Attacking meant the possibility for merits; retreating meant being able to keep his life!Such an ambush would naturally mean there was a large force. From the rain of arrows earlier, it was enough to know that a passive defense technique would not be good. Even if the enemies were weakened, they could kill him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe only way to solve the situation was to start an offensive.Du Shi Qing cannot die!Currently, Du Shi Qing had Manager Gao\u2019s protection. At least for the time being, he should be okay. Chu Yang was not worried about him even for a little. That was why after that one key sword movement, he immediately took his next action.Bring the killing into the forest!Whoever was in that forest, they were the true source of this ambush!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Only his cold and alert eyes were shown; they were devoid of any emotions.One look at those eyes and you could tell this was a skilled and seasoned soldier! This kind of person only has one creed in life: kill the enemy and complete the task!On the ground in front of him was a row of hidden crossbows. Each was already preloaded with ten shiny black arrows, ready to be fired.Chu Yang carefully held his breath and advanced slowly. His body was currently hidden on a treetop. Like a silent ghost, he advanced in an extraordinary manner.Looking down from up high, Chu Yang carefully scanned all four directions below. Nearby there were many more such shiny arrows. From the number of arrows, he guessed there were at least fifty to sixty people!This ambush was clearly planned well ahead of time! How did the enemies know that the group would rest here? Plus, they actually buried the bow and arrows in advance?Looking at the enemies\u2019 hiding positions, Chu Yang could not help but frowned. They were extremely well-calculated!From each position, they could keep watch on at least three of their companions. They can easily help each other, without fail. On the off chance that someone got discovered, they can provide support!Only the most elite of military soldiers could come up with this plan! If he attacked anyone in the group, three others would immediately find out!The enemies\u2019 hiding positions not only were extremely well-covered to the outside, they also created a battle formation without any blind spots! It was impossible to quietly attack a group like this one. The only thing left to do was to fight from the inside out; there was no other way!In the center of this formation, behind some short bushes was a vague silhouette of a person sitting very still. At first glance, this person was not special in comparison to the others, but Chu Yang recognized that this was the most important person.This was because the place he was hiding in had at least ten people watching! For other places in the formation, there was only a maximum of five people watching. Moreover, his position was at the center; the whole thing was essentially a net of protection for him. Next to him, nestled amongst the foliage, was an extremely large piece of equipment! It was the siege crossbow.At this moment, beyond the thick forest, the sound of manager Gao and eight other people talking were clearly heard: \u201c\u2026if you take Du Shi Qing and turn around, we will not pursue\u2026\u201d As these words fell on Chu Yang\u2019s ears, he was a little shaken. He could already make a rough guess who these people were.They had the siege crossbow; plus, they were very disciplined. Of course they were of military background!Chu yang\u2019s body continued to float in a ghostly manner as he approached the leader. Suddenly, he pushed hard with his two legs and his whole body shot down from the treetop like a lightning bolt. Like a hawk grabbing its prey, his ten fingers curled as he fiercely sprung forward!When Chu Yang was less than a meter away from this person, the air hissed. An arrow suddenly flew toward Chu Yang. This arrow seemed to have alerted the whole group. Some thirty to forty sharp arrows flew like lightning from all directions, creating a series of violent whistling sounds in the air.The first arrow was the real threat; the others were clearly one step too late.Chu Yang tilted his body to one side, and the first arrow passed by his nose, missing it by about a centimeter. His hands kept their original stance as continued to fly down.After seeing the positions of the enemies, Chu yang immediately changed his approach. He took a more aggressive initiative. He only needed the group to discover him. Along with his speed to disrupt their rhythm, he could destroy their perfect cooperation!This was not the time to kill the enemies, but to disrupt their formation first!Furthermore, that other person was of great importance. Capturing him was enough to destroy this ambush!In seizing this man, he had the opportunity to finish this in one shot!This person immediately saw Chu Yang. His eyes flashed, but he never panicked. He screamed, and his whole body jumped up. The moment he was off the ground he turned, and, with arms outstretched, shot ten arrows in Chu Yang\u2019s direction. This was followed by a flash of a saber fiercely slashing in the direction of Chu Yang\u2019s neck.Chu Yang\u2019s agile body easily avoided those ten arrows. In a flash, his right arm went forward pass the saber, and his clawed hand straightened as he palmed the nape of this powerful person. This movement was extremely fast.The person glared at him. His eyes flashed a look of disbelief as his whole body fell down like a wooden block.Even though this person\u2019s reaction was very quick, but Chu Yang had momentum from falling down from up high. Plus, the other person was caught by surprise; his reaction came too late!Chu Yang did not wait until his body touched the ground. His right hand grabbed the person\u2019s collar and lifted him up. Chu Yang\u2019s two feet had just touched the ground when he pushed hard, and he shot back into the air.After he just flew up, his legs immediate pushed hard against a large tree. The large tree shook violently under his push. Leaves flew down like rain. Like an arrow, Chu Yang flew straight out of the forest. That person must have weighed almost two hundred pounds, but Chu Yang held him with his right hand as if it was nothing. His quick actions was not affected in the slightest.Hundreds of arrows gave chase behind him, but Chu Yang was not bothered by them. He simply swayed his body a few times to avoid them. Chu Yang\u2019s black clothes were ripped apart in the front and back, but his body did not have one scratch.It clearly looked as if a few arrows were piercing into Chu yang\u2019s body, but the next moment, those arrows only went through his clothes and flew out in a strange manner. Chu Yang\u2019s silhouette did not change as he flew faster and faster!The soldiers in hiding were clearly concerned about the fact that Chu Yang was holding that person. With each arrow, they tried their best to avoid him. In doing so, they have unwittingly helped Chu Yang\u2019s movement as well as verification of the person\u2019s identity!This person was definitely not ordinary at all!Chu Yang\u2019s two legs successively kicked fiercely on the tree trunks. His body was like an electrical pulse flying through the thick forest. Most of the arrows that tore through the wind after him ended up in tree trunks!After a few breaths, Chu Yang left in a blur as they were still mobilizing; as for him, he was already almost out of the thick forest!In front of him, there was suddenly a loud roar as a few people simultaneously jumped out. They swung their sabers fiercely blocking Chu Yang\u2019s escape.Chu Yang\u2019s eyes flashed as his two legs suddenly pushed hard. He was originally moving forward, but now he mysteriously flew straight up into the air by about three meters. After rising above their heads, Chu Yang continued to push against the big tree trunks and flew out like a shooting star, leaving shaking trees in his wake.He was finally out of the forest and into the wide open fields.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe ambush party in the surroundings could no longer stay hidden. They revealed themselves as they came out from all four directions to give chase after Chu Yang. Behind the black masks, their eyes have all lost the extreme calm of earlier. They were replaced with only concern.They had developed a very meticulous plan. The eight experts were to come out and reduce the group power. In the chaos, they would attack and kill Du Shi Qing, and disappear right afterward.They did not plan on the appearance of this wretched, unknown boy, who shot straight into their crucial position and caught their commander. And, thus, he has wrecked their plans!Even though they were all furious, each person was also extremely puzzled: How could this youth have penetrated the center of their tight knitted defense with such accuracy? Was it possible that he has some kind of divining ability?With their plans fallen apart like this, how could they return?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 52 \u2013 You kill him and I\u2019ll kill himThe great man in Chu Yang\u2019s clutches was still unconscious and oblivious to everything that was happening around him.Chu Yang did not want to take his life.It was not that Chu Yang was afraid to kill people; killing people was truly a very easy thing for him. What he was most concerned with was resolving the current danger; the second thing was finding out the origin of these people!They were most likely from Iron Cloud! Moreover, they were probably the Dead Warriors (TLN: ready to die to accomplish their tasks) under Prince Tie Bu Tian\u2019s command.They would be the only people who did not want Du Shi Qing to come to Iron Cloud! On the off chance that Du Shi Qing could perform a miracle and help Tie Shi Cheng recover his health, the country of Iron Cloud would fall into the peculiar situation of having two kings.No matter how solid the relationship between the two were, their underlings would not necessarily see it that way. Tie Bu Tian was currently the spiritual pillar, the savior, and the only hope of Iron Cloud Nation.Tie Shi Cheng\u2019s recovery would have a huge effect on Tie Bu Tian\u2019s status. More importantly, it would decrease the military\u2019s morale because no army can be loyal to two leaders at the same time!Facing Diwu Qing Rou under such conditions, Iron Cloud would most certainly be doomed to failure!If these people were indeed who Chu Yang thought they were, he absolutely could not kill them! Iron Cloud\u2019s strength had greatly fallen in comparison to Great Zhao already. Therefore, not even a little strength should be wasted.These Dead Warriors were the treasure of the military. If he killed them, one thing would be certain: at least one unit of Iron Cloud\u2019s military would fall into chaos. While the effect of this could not be predicted, but there would surely be an overall effect on the war.Chu Yang had planned to reverse fate and help Tie Bu Tian defeat Diwu Qing Rou, so he could not kill these people!Chu Yang came out of the thick forest like a meteor, behind him an entire black-outfitted army swarmed out in pursuit! Chu Yang was not the least bit concerned with it as he jumped up and down in between the two clashing sides. While he were still in mid-air, Chu Yang yelled loudly:\u201cIf you want him alive, you will all stop!\u201dAfter finishing this sentence, Chu Yang dropped to the ground. He staggered and then rolled on the ground with the other person. Afterward, he struggled to stand up, but fell to the ground once more. At this point, his face was flushed as he breathed heavily. After a violent coughing fit, he spit out blood on the ground.From the beginning to end of his whole feat, Chu Yang was virtually not breathing. His actions were continuous without any breaks, so, naturally, his internal systems have suffered some shock. Now that he had a chance to catch his breath, his whole body had become completely relaxed with no strength left at all.However, the first thing he had to do was bring the icy cold sword to the man\u2019s neck.And like that, Chu Yang knelt on the ground with one hand holding the sword to the man\u2019s neck, panting heavily. His appearance was disheveled, but his eyes were calm and cold. Looking at those eyes, no one dared to move. If they did not follow his order, that man\u2019s head would surely fall to the ground!The currently situation had become exceedingly dangerous. Manager Gao was under attack from six people; even though, he was not beaten, he was also not free to save Du Shi Qing. The six realized that they were not Manager Gao\u2019s opponents so in a desperate attempt to hold him they took turns and attacked him in a suicidal manner.Even though they were all wounded, they were determined to fight to the death.The other two had already reached the carriage. Out of the eight guards that followed, four were already on the ground. Only a little more time and the carriage would be destroyed exposing Du Shi Qing within.However, everything was reversed within a second. Everyone was fiercely fighting with each other when they suddenly became paralyzed. They looked at Chu Yang in astonishment, unable to say a word.This youth was a mess. His clothes was tattered. He looked as if he was on his last breath. Additionally, there was blood at the edge of his mouth; he seemed to be dying.If some silly youth yelled out like that, he would have been greeted with a sword. However, seeing the person he was holding, they knew that this was no joke.Even though he was breathing heavily, his sword was steady and remained unmoved. His eyes remained alert in all four directions.\u201cRelease him!\u201dThe masked leader immediately recognized who Chu Yang was holding. He could not help but roar in anger! At this point, he even felt it was a little surreal.How could this be? Was the general not under strict protection?One hundred Dead Warriors, of which, eight were Martial Masters, twenty were Martial Warriors, and the rest were Martial Pupils of high grade.Plus, there were also the fifty archers and the siege crossbow!Such a powerful force never lost to any army. This plan was supposed to be no different from squatting a mosquito with a mountain. That divine doctor was supposed to be chopped to pieces here.How did the general fall into the hands of the enemy?The whole thing happened in the dark of night, and it was also in treacherous terrain. Moreover, the general\u2019s position was in the center of the formation, under many layers of protection. How did he get here?\u201cRelease him?\u201d Still panting, Chu Yang laughed, \u201cIf you were me, would you release him?\u201d\u201cYou happened to catch an insignificant person in our group. And you still dare to use him to threaten us? What a joke!\u201d Even though the leader was anxious, his voice was calm once again.\u201cInsignificant person?\u201d Chu Yang laughed, \u201cSo he is only an insignificant person?\u201dAfter he finished speaking, he suddenly moved his arm. The blade sliced the man\u2019s shoulder and fresh blood spilled everywhere.\u201cYou\u2026!\u201dAll the masked people revealed a look of shock in their eyes. One of them was so concerned that he took a step forward.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d The masked person asked, controlling his anger.Still holding his sword, Chu Yang glanced at him and said sadly, \u201cYou just told me that he is only an insignificant person; I was so depressed, I could barely hold onto my sword. Anyway, if he is only an insignificant person, you should just continue your battle. Haha, we should divide our duties clearly. You kill him [Du Shi Qing], and I\u2019ll kill him [your leader].\u201dAfter he finished talking, Chu Yang turned his sword around and slowly but decisively stabbed the general\u2019s arm. Chu Yang\u2019s gaze was full of mockery as he looked at the masked man facing him. He casually let the blood spill on him.\u201cHold on!\u201d The masked leader finally gave in and took a step forward, \u201cWhat are your demands?\u201d\u201cVery simple. You and your people back up and let us go!\u201d Chu Yang\u2019s breathing had normalized. He unsteadily stood up dragging the arm of the other man. \u201cWhen we are safe, I will let this insignificant person go. Haha.\u201dWhen he said the words \u201cinsignificant person,\u201d he deliberately acted as if he had difficulty breathing and spoke very slowly, showing full sarcasm.\u201cYou\u2026 You have to remove the sword and then we\u2019ll talk!\u201d The masked person spoke anxiously and angrily, \u201cTorturing someone like that, how can you call yourself a hero!\u201d\u201cHero? I am not a hero.\u201d Chu Yang slowly pulled the sword out and said coldly, \u201cI currently only have one purpose. It is to arrive at Iron Cloud Citadel safe and sound! Things like today, I hope to not encounter a second time!\u201d\u201cI will comply!\u201d The masked leader said sincerely, \u201cBut how do I know if you are trustworthy?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euChu Yang said coolly, \u201cUntil now, I have not bothered to remove his mask. Is this enough sincerity?\u201dThe masked man spoke in amazement, \u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s more than enough!\u201dNot removing the mask of his enemy meant that the opponent did not want to make a big deal out of the incident, giving both sides a possible exit. If he had taken the mask off then the general\u2019s identity would have been revealed. At that time, the only course of action would be to kill everyone to destroy the evidence. Naturally, this killing would also affect the life of the general. Not to mention Fire Saber Great Master, Gao Wei Cheng, if he wanted to escape then none of them could stop him.Du Shi Qing was invited by Tie Bu Tian, the prince of Iron Cloud. Plus, he went with permission from Great Zhao. If Gao Wei Cheng escaped and told people of this, then everything would fall apart. This was dangerous to the relationship of the two countries. Once this was discovered, they would easily be judged as traitors of Iron Cloud.The consequences would be disastrous.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the blink of an eye, they created an awe-inspiring, impregnable wall.Manager Gao and the four remaining guards felt as if they were dreaming.They were just in a precarious situation and the enemy was about to succeed. They were feeling angry and hopeless when Chu Yang, unexpectedly, appeared with another person. What was even more surprising was the fact that he yelled for them stop.And indeed the enemies did stop!Now that they were hearing the conversation, they know that this other person was the commander of the team!Unbelievable! How could there be such coincidences? This was truly unimaginable!It was truly risky to enter the enemies\u2019 formation alone. But to kidnap the commander and once again waltz through many layers of defenses? Turning the tide of the battle in the blink of an eye with the power of just one person\u2026 Was this a myth or a legend?It seemed that no such thing has ever been written in history!Everyone looked at Chu Yang in a different light!\u201cThere is one thing I need\u2026\u201d The person in black hesitated, then continued, \u201cI want to verify that person is still alive!\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201d Chu Yang said enthusiastically. After that he palmed the person\u2019s heart and transferred a wave of cold air into his body.That person immediately shivered and became alert. At which point, he discovered his situation and yelled out angrily, \u201cWhat are you waiting for? Kill them now!\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 sir\u2026\u201d\u201cNo need to worry about me!\u201d The hostage yelled, \u201cAt this point, what are you worrying about me for?\u201d\u201cSir, your mask has not been taken off.\u201d Chu Yang said softly, \u201cPlus, you have lost. In this situation, will you even be able fight us to the death? Would your subordinate dare to do such thing?\u201dThe man became livid. He cursed, \u201cBastard! Who are you? How are we defeated? What qualifies you to tell us we have lost this battle?\u201d\u201cMy qualification is\u2026\u201d Chu Yang said arrogantly, \u201cYou are in my hands! You are only a fish waiting to be flayed. Understand?\u201dThe hostage immediately became quiet and started breathing heavily. His eyes were full of shame and anguish. Suddenly, he twisted his body and tried to bring his neck into Chu Yang\u2019s blade!People yelled out in terror!Chu Yang laughed coldly, with a powerful lift, he tossed the hostage to the ground with just one arm. He kicked his butt, and said viciously, \u201cIf you don\u2019t listen to me, then even if you die, I will strip off your mask and your clothes as well. Then I will use your body as a flag to enter Iron Cloud citadel! If you like, you can go ahead and give me a try!\u201dThe man was stunned and finally calmed down. He was not afraid of death, but what Chu Yang just said was downright malicious!With his prestigious position in Iron Cloud, he could not suffer such humiliation even after death! There was also the reputation of his family, the reputation of the military\u2026\u201cFine\u2026\u201d He sighed, \u201cWhat you want is to arrive at Iron Cloud citadel safely. I will comply. From here on, no one will try to stop you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have any faith in those words!\u201d Chu Yang said coldly, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to ask you to escort us!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d The man turned and glared at Chu Yang.Chu Yang was shaken when he saw within those eyes an endless coldness along with great power. Moreover, those eyes seemed to speak of a haughtiness and a lack of respect for life.This was definitely a character of high position!\u201cNo need to stare at me like that. Once we are safe, I will let you go. I know you are concerned. Rest assured, I will not make it hard on you and will not disclose your identity. Even I do not know who you are.\u201d Chu Yang said casually, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in your promises, but you can believe in mine.\u201dHe paused a little and said calmly, \u201cYou have no other choice!\u201dThe man glared at him for a while and suddenly waved dismissively to his underlings, \u201cYou guys should leave. I will go and play with them for a little while.\u201d\u201cYour\u2026 Eldest martial brother\u2026!\u201d The leader in the black-outfitted group took a firm step forward. He unexpectedly threw himself on the ground and put out his arms, \u201cTake me instead of eldest martial brother! I promise to obey you the whole way. Rest assured, even though I am worth less than my eldest martial brother, we will keep our promise.\u201d\u201cShut up! Get the f* out of here!\u201d Chu Yang\u2019s hostage roared angrily, \u201cYou\u2026 him\u2026 motherf*\u2026 You want to piss me off? After I get back, I will kill your entire family, take your property\u2026 motherf*\u2026 Kill all nine generations of your relatives! (TLN: From great great grandfather to great great grandchildren. Much more serious than the normal punishment of three generations.) You dare to speak gibberish in front of me? Get out of here now!\u201d\u201cBring those punks with you. Motherf*s still not going. Get out of here\u2026 get out of here\u2026 get\u2026!\u201d The man swore, \u201cLooking at you mother*s so excited like this. You must be really happy, huh? You\u2019re still not leaving?\u201dUnder his anger and screaming, his underlings reluctantly departed.\u201cYou listen to me! If you so much as touch a hair on our eldest martial brother, we will mince you to pieces even if it means nine generations of our family get killed and we have to go to the corner of the earth to hunt you down.\u201dThe black-outfitted person yelled out and walked away. Not long after, they disappeared into the thick forest.Seeing that they had left, an exhausted Chu Yang sat down on the ground. He placed his shaky hand in his chest and held the Pure Purple Jade Essence to recover his martial energy.Unexpectedly, there rose an overbearing opposition in his head. Nine Tribulations Sword Spirit would not let him do it.Chu Yang sat dumbfounded and cursed internally, \u201cF*! You didn\u2019t help me when I was fighting earlier, and now you won\u2019t let me recover my martial energy?\u201d\u201cWhen you were fighting earlier, you did not use the force of Nine Tribulations Sword, then did you want help in cheering you on? I can only assist you, not take over your body. Whether it is your physical body or your thoughts, the one in control is you, Chu Yang, not Nine Tribulations Sword. This is something you need to be clear on! Now, let\u2019s talk about the recovery. When you get to the point of extreme pain and exhaustion, only by using your own effort to recover can you breakthrough and increase your martial energy. You keep depending on this damn jade to get warm winters and cool summers (TLN: basically an easy life); recover quickly while just sitting there! Breakthrough your head! (TLN: kind of the phrase \u2018my ass\u2019 in English)Chu Yang did not expect Nine Tribulation Sword Spirit to completely recover, and he certainly did not expect it to talk to him like this, so he could not help but to be surprised to hear all these things.Pure Purple Jade Essence was a precious treasure, but in the mouth of the sword spirit, it became a useless piece of jade to cool and warm commoners!\u201cOnce you find out about your origin, the first thing I will do is devour that damn piece of jade! So much energy stored within, but I can only watch!\u201d The sword spirit mumbled and without waiting for a reaction from Chu yang, it fell back into silence.WTF! Chu Yang\u2019s eyes rolled and his mouth was gaping. So this guy has been tempted by the jade the whole time.\u201cYou can absorb that energy! Since when did I say you couldn\u2019t?\u201d Chu Yang said inquisitively.\u201cThen what will you use to find your parents? Just go all over the world with your bare ass?\u201d Nine Tribulations Sword spirit yelled in anger. Afterward, it mumbled, \u201cFor thousands of years I could not find a suitable host. Now that I found one, it\u2019s a brain-dead idiot!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWho are you calling an idiot?\u201d Chu Yang was furious. Enraged, he yelled loudly. His mouth was foaming!F*! Nine Tribulation Sword in the previous life did not dare talk to him that way. You are only a sword! I might be patience, but I won\u2019t put up with this insolence!\u201cI\u2026 I did not call you\u2026\u201d A confused face and a puzzled voice came to him.Manager Gao, with a concerned face, came closer to Chu Yang. He originally wanted to thank Chu Yang. He did not think that the other person would suddenly open his eyes wide and yell: \u201cWho are you calling an idiot?\u201dManager Gao was thoroughly shocked. When did I call you that? I didn\u2019t even open my mouth yet!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He smiled awkwardly and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean you!\u201dConfused, Manager Gao looked around. You weren\u2019t talking to me? Besides me, is there anyone else around here? This kid is truly not normal\u2026\u201cAh, I have fallen into the hands of a head case!\u201d The exhausted hostage said as he lay on the ground. He rolled his eyes and sighed sadly, \u201cI dreamt of being a hero, spending my whole life traversing under the heavens and doing great things that will shake heaven and earth\u2026 but today I have made the mistake of falling into the hands of this psychotic guy. Such bad luck!!!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the psychotic one!\u201d Chu Yang answered as he rolled his eyes. Suddenly, he was startled. What? Why does this narcissistic attitude seem so familiar? Have I contracted Tan Tan\u2019s virtue?At this time, the four surviving guards approached them. Their martial brothers have died under the hands of this hostage\u2019s men, so their gazes were not friendly at all.\u201cYou guys should move away! I don\u2019t want to be disturbed.\u201d The hostage roared, \u201cBothering me, do you want to die?\u201dHe was a hostage, but he was still so arrogant!Du Shi Qing came out from inside the carriage, his countenance showed that he had calmed down somewhat. He gave Chu Yang a nod, \u201cChu Yang! It\u2019s lucky that we have you!\u201dHe paused a little then said emotionally, \u201cIf it was not for you, I am afraid I would have left my body here. Regardless of what I have done for you before, we are even now!\u201dDu Shi Qing smiled, \u201cYou do not have to feel burdened anymore. A doctor\u2019s job is to save lives, therefore there\u2019s really no debts to talk about; it\u2019s just part of the job. Today, you were the true savior.\u201dChu Yang was suddenly filled with admiration. If Du Shi Qing could say such words, he was truly worthy of the title top divine doctor. Chu Yang immediately said, \u201cSenior Du is too kind! These things were just my own doings, you should not break our prior commitment because of this.\u201d\u201cOf course not!\u201d Du Shi Qing nodded and smiled, \u201cThe safety and identity of this person determines our safety. It\u2019s important to look at the big picture.\u201dThe hostage grunted and said, \u201cI know you guys wouldn\u2019t dare!\u201dAfter he finished, he turned back and look at Chu Yang with a sharp gaze, \u201cHey, damn kid! There were so many people, why did you only go after me?\u201dChu Yang smiled, \u201cBecause you are the most important. If I caught someone else, would the others retreat?\u201dThe hostage laughed loudly, revealing a heroic air that could not be covered up by the mask. He asked, \u201cWhat I am most puzzled about is how you knew I am the most important person?\u201d\u201cThis is something I shouldn\u2019t tell you, but you seem like a nice enough person, I will break the rule this one time.\u201dChu Yang thought a little, then tilted his head and smiled, \u201cIt was because your men placed you in a very important position.\u201d\u201cMy men and I eat and drink together. We go into battle together; I always work to serve as a good example for all the soldiers\u2026 How can you say I was placed in a special position? What nonsense!\u201d\u201cEven though you act that way, they do not think that way.\u201d Chu Yang said coldly, \u201cAn army cannot work without a general, but if that general wants to serve as an example for his soldiers in everything, then he becomes an obstacle for that army. In fact, he might be its biggest failure!\u201dHe looked at the man mockingly, \u201cEven though this general thinks he always does a good job, he doesn\u2019t know that it is the very thing that will send his army to its doom.\u201dThe man became pensive, \u201cThen what is the perfect middle ground?\u201d\u201cA leader who always wants to set an example for his soldiers will never become a good leader. However, if he always gives orders and directs from behind, then he would definitely not succeed. There must be a balance.\u201d Chu Yang said casually, \u201cI have never been a general nor have I lead any soldiers, so I don\u2019t know where that balance is nor could I give you any advice.\u201dThe man was suddenly stunned. His brows raised as he thought carefully. After a long time, he looked up and said sincerely, \u201cI will heed your words!\u201dChu Yang was really interested in this guy he just captured. At first glance, he might seem crude, but he was actually quite shrewd. Moreover, this person was only a Martial Warrior, but eight of his underlings were Martial Masters.Even though it was a difference of just one word, but it was an insurmountable gap. Being able to lead with such low cultivation compared to your own men, it was definitely abnormal!He was honorable\u2026 It could be seen that his status in the army was extremely high.There are not likely many such leaders in Iron Cloud Nation. He must live!As he came to this thought, Chu Yang sighed and looked at bodies of the guards on the ground. He then looked at the anguish in the faces of the ones still living. They looked so helpless, even with the enemy in hands, they could not do anything!Or it could be said this was beyond them; it was now a conflict between two countries!However, Chu Yang felt some contempt. Currently, he was an outsider; the two countries were of little concerns to him. Du Shi Qing was a good person, but this journey of his had a direct effect on Chu Yang\u2019s efforts to invert fate. Tie Shi Cheng\u2019s illness has a definite effect on the fate of Iron Cloud Nation. If Iron Cloud Nation fell, then Beyond the Heavens Sect\u2019s fate would be dire as well.If Beyond the Heavens Sect fell, then his master and martial brothers would also die. Mo Qing Wu would not be lucky enough to keep her own life either. Du Shi Qing might be a good person, but Chu Yang could not support him.These assassins were not necessarily bad people; their path coincided with Chu Yang\u2019s. There was no way he could kill these people!However, if Chu Yang placed himself in the shoes of the surviving guards, he would definitely not spare this hostage. He would not pay any mind to promises made or have any scruples with messing up the bigger picture.Four martial brothers were slain. If you don\u2019t take revenge, can you still be a man?But these four guards stood in anguish. They did not take any actions even though they were not being restrained.Chu Yang looked down on such gutless people. It was true that this was the promise made to the assassins, but he still looked down on those four guys.After looking around, Chu Yang sat cross-legged. Recovering his strength was most important right now!Chu Yang took a deep breath and tried to activate the remaining energy from his dantian. Strangely enough, his dantian had been emptied. The only energy the he managed to scrape up was whatever that was left in his meridians. It was so little, it was pathetic!At point, Chu Yang used the path of Nine Tribulations Transcending the Nine Heavens Technique for the first time to recover his energy. Since he was no longer in Beyond the Heavens Sect, he did not have any reservations.In his previous life, he did practiced Nine Tribulations Transcending the Nine Heavens Technique, but he did not understand one thing. This technique clearly could help him advance in cultivation level quicker, but what category did it belong to? Good or evil? It was, after all, a very strange technique\u2026When Manager Gao saw that Chu Yang was trying to recover his energy, he abandoned the thought of talking to him. Instead, he decided to stay on the side and assist him in the process. However, his eyes suddenly opened wide; he could not believe what he was seeing.Motherf*! This can\u2019t be!!! He just sat down for such a short amount of time, how could he already enter into his meditative state already?Seeing Chu Yang\u2019s seemingly glistening countenance, Manager Gao rubbed his eyes in disbelief.Meditate, clear the mind, gather thoughts, draw energy from the dantian, and pass it through all the meridians. After many rounds like that, then one can enter the meditative state. That had always been the case; no one was ever exempt. I have been a Great Master for a few decades, and, even though I have not broken through Revered status, can my experience be considered lacking?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euUntil now, Manager Gao had always abided by this set of rules. Plus, after injuries, it would be especially difficult to do those steps.How could this person just set his butt down and immediately enter meditative state?Manager Gao eyes widened; he suddenly felt that his old beliefs have been shattered.Chu Yang slowly brought the leftover energy in the meridians to his dantian. After that, he used the paths of Nine Tribulations Transcending the Nine Heavens Technique to slowly move energy through meridians all around his body.Unexpectedly, the Nine Tribulations sword point from inside his dantian pierced out. It became a sharp force the led the energy like a general leading his troops into battle. All obstacles ahead dissolved into smoke!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The power of Golden Blood Root, which was quietly fortifying his meridians also suddenly woke up. It joined with the force of Nine Tribulations Sword and became fully integrated into Chu Yang\u2019s meridians.After only one round, the sword tip emitted a strong force making Chu Yang\u2019s meridians expand and created an extremely exuberant feeling!Outside of his body, Chu Yang clothes did not cease to flutter. A faint black mist seemed to shoot out of his mouth and nose. Chu Yang immediately felt relaxed.Manager Gao stood opposite of him with wide eyes and gaping mouth; he was stunned!What did I just see?Oh, God\u2026! Help me\u2026 I must be sick! My eyes must have some issues\u2026This kid just sat down and immediate entered meditative state, but that was not even the half of it. How could he recover after less than one round? Additionally, how could he have a breakthrough in less than the time it take to finish a pot of tea? (TLN: 30 minutes \u2013 1 hour) How can this be?This strange phenomenon left the famous Fire Saber Great Master completely out of sorts\u2026Chu Yang slowly opened his eyes. A sharp sword aura seemed to flash in his gaze and he returned to normal.The moment he opened his eyes, the hostage and manager Gao, looking at him, immediately felt an extreme pain. It was as if their eyes were pierced with a red hot needle.The two of them were both fearless men, but, in this moment, in front of Chu Yang, there rose a feeling of terror inside them!It was as if they had come face to face with an ancient demon that was just freed from its seal, bringing with it the force to destroy heaven and earth.Another breakthrough: Martial Warrior grade four!If manager Gao knew that four- five days ago Chu Yang just advanced from Martial Pupil to Martial Warrior grade one, his eyes would have probably popped out of their sockets. After that he would probably have high blood pressure and die from a blood clot\u2026\u201cYou can have a breakthrough like this? I give up!\u201d Manager Gao eyes rolled and his hands couldn\u2019t seem to stop shaking. He looked at Chu Yang with a gaze full of jealousy.We\u2019re both humans; this was really unfair! Every time I have a breakthrough, it felt as painful as if my skin was being peeled off. As for him, he looked as if he was enjoying the breakthrough\u2026\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Manager Gao asked, his head felt like it was on fire.\u201cI only broke through one grade.\u201d Chu Yang frowned, \u201cHow can it be so slow? This can\u2019t be right\u2026\u201dManager Gao staggered, his body shook, \u201cWhen was your last breakthrough?\u201d He thought to himself: Perhaps this guy was caught in a bottleneck for many years? If that was the case, then it would make some sense.Chu Yang scratched his head, rolled his eyes, and answered with some uncertainty, \u201cMaybe four or five days ago. The time span is a little too long this time, that\u2019s why I thought it was a little strange\u2026\u201dManager Gao\u2019s eyes widened and his lips trembled as he shakily pointed his finger at Chu Yang. Then he suddenly sat on the ground. His face became swollen and red in an abnormal manner. It was as if all of his blood had rushed to his head.A while later, still dizzy, he stood up. With a pale face, he turned and walked away. His gait somewhat wobbly.Chu Yang asked in surprise, \u201cManager Gao, are you okay?\u201dManager Gao seemed to be in a dream state as he muttered, \u201cI am going to sleep. I have not slept for a few days, that\u2019s why I am hallucinating\u2026\u201dThe masked man shook his head and exclaimed sincerely, \u201cBefore, at Iron Cloud Citadel, I have seen punks acting as if they were loaded by treating money like dirt. Their attitude was deserving of a good beating. I thought they were acting, but today, I have seen what real acting is. With your ability, those punks should be bowing to you and calling you great master!\u201dChu Yang remained silent.I was just telling the truth! I remembered, in my previous lifetime, I did not just breakthrough one grade but multiple grades at the speed of a flying arrow! But\u2026 this breakthrough felt decidedly different!\u201cCultivation is about quality. Going slowly and firmly is the ultimate way! You must take step by step; understanding and retaining each step. In your previous life, did you enjoyed soaring on a pig like that, you fool? If it were not for me helping you, you would have been done in a long time ago. Do you know why you could not reach the pinnacle in your previous life? It was exactly because you missed this period of step by step insight!\u201d\u201cIf you want to take everything in one big bite, you will end up choking to death! Do you understand, idiot?\u201d An arrogant voice rang in his head.Chu Yang suddenly understood everything. It was true, cultivation in martial arts was the same as maturing in life. From youth to adulthood, you have to learn and understand slowly with time; that was the right way. If there was an elixir to make a newborn become a thirty-year-old, would he be able to truly have the mind of a thirty-year-old?No wonder even the most powerful could only advance one step at a time. So Nine Tribulations Sword wanted to hold me back so that I can fully comprehend everything with time.\u201cYou are now only but the ink drop! (TLN: Insignificant, compared to a book\u2026 such as TTNH) Why not try to find some supplements? If you keep going at turtle pace, when will you be great?\u201d\u201cSupplements?\u201d Chu Yang was puzzled, \u201cWhat supplements?\u201d\u201cSuch as Seven-Star White Magnolia, Nine-Leaf Spirit Root, Purple Air Spirit Star\u2026 those can all be used\u2026 There\u2019s more\u2026 you can also use Purple Crystal Jade, Legendary Gold Iron, Star Steel, Nightmare Silver, and Diamond Sand. Eighteen thousand pounds of each should be enough\u2026\u201dChu Yang\u2019s arms and legs trembled and he stumbled to the ground!Unable to control himself, he cursed, \u201cMotherf*! What do you think those things are, vegetables?! They are all legendary herbs! Being able to find 0.1 pound is already fortunate; you want eighteen thousand pounds? Are you delirious?\u201dEven though Manager Gao and Du Shi Qing was already a distance away, when they hear Chu Yang roared in anger like that, they both turned around.The hostage facing Chu Yang, cried in rage, \u201cInsolent! I want to eat a few pounds of beef! Do you know how hungry I am? You\u2026! Motherf*\u2026 This is how you are going to treat a prisoner like me? Insolent, what legendary herbs? In your family, is beef considered legendary? I have never met such country bumpkin!\u201dSo it turned out that guy was hungry, and he was giving Chu Yang his requests\u2026Chu Yang tilted his head, grinned his teeth, and yelled angrily, \u201cShut up! I will strip you and feed the horses aphrodisiac!\u201dA moment after, Chu Yang\u2019s eyes flashed fiercely.The words Chu Yang said left the man shaking. On his pale face, his mouth opened in despair. He was furious on the inside, but did not dare show any of it. At this point, he finally understood that he had fallen into the hands of a rogue\u2026Those words he just said, can a normal person say such things?\u201cThese things are needed for when Nine Tribulations Sword levels up.\u201d The voice laughed heartily in Chu Yang\u2019s consciousness, \u201cLittle brat, let me tell you a piece of good news. So before you open the Nine Tribulations Sword interspace, you will also get a little surprise. You are truly useless; after such a long time and you have yet to discover the vast abilities of Nine Tribulations Sword!\u201d\u201cNine Tribulations Sword interspace?\u201d Chu Yang was surprised.\u201cExactly, Nine Tribulations Sword interspace!\u201d\u201cWait! Then you\u2026 You are not a sword spirit?\u201d Chu Yang asked. (TLN: I assume Chu Yang asked this because the sword spirit should have access to the sword interspace)\u201cYes, I am Nine Tribulations Sword. But currently\u2026 I cannot be one with Nine Tribulations Sword.\u201d The voice was full of sorrow, \u201cDamn bastard! Having to find a sword master was bad enough, why did he have to separate the spirit from the sword? Damn, damn\u2026\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d Chu Yang felt his heart beat rapidly. Was the sword spirit cursing the mysterious person who created Nine Tribulations Sword?\u201cI have forgotten who he was.\u201d The voice sighed and said, \u201cOnly when you get all nine sword fragments then sword and spirit can become one. When you get all nine fragments, then I can fully recover.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou must patiently search. Those things are not hard to find. There are a lot in this world.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 what if I am not lucky enough to find them?\u201d Chu Yang asked meekly.\u201cNine Tribulations Sword cannot be destroyed. Just take your time and search, even if it takes eighteen thousand years.\u201dAfter finishing this, the sword spirit did not make another sound.\u201cAh\u2026 eighteen thousand years\u2026\u201d Chu felt his head spinning and his eyes were seeing spots.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Perhaps it was really easy back then. Those things might have been everywhere. However, do you know it\u2019s extremely difficult now? Is this any different from a death sentence?\u201cHey, I want to eat!\u201d The hostage yelled, but this time, a little softer, \u201cEven prisoners have to eat. You\u2019re not going to let me starve, are you? I\u2019m hungry\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d Chu Yang was really unhappy; he suddenly grabbed the hostage\u2019s shirt and roared ferociously, \u201cDon\u2019t think that I am afraid to kill you! I didn\u2019t kill you because you are still of some use\u2026 But if you make me lose my patience then cutting your head off would not be a difficult thing!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t think that I\u2019m afraid to die\u2026\u201d The man yelled angrily, but when he saw the darkness in Chu Yang\u2019s eyes, he shuddered and did not say anything else.O god! This person is really a demon! As the saying goes, \u2018a wise man knows when to retreat.\u2019Chu Yang stood up and went toward the bonfire. He conveniently chopped off a dead horse\u2019s hind leg, pierced it with two arrows from the ground and placed it on the bonfire to roast.The flickering fire light shone on Chu Yang\u2019s face making it look strangely light and dark at the same time.\u201cPlump!\u201d Chu Yang tossed the roasted horse leg in front of the masked man and yelled, \u201cEat!\u201d\u201cHorse meat is too sour; I want beef!\u201d The man responded angrily.\u201cYou want beef? You look like beef!\u201d Chu Yang mocked, \u201cEat or not, it\u2019s up to you.\u201d With that, he turned and left.The man looked like he was trying to swallow down a clump of anger that was stuck in his throat. He looked at the piece of horse meat in his hand and wanted to throw it away, but he knew that if he threw it away then he would starve. The other guy would never relent!He sighed and mercilessly bit into the horse leg. Then he chewed ferociously, so the gnashing sounds of his teeth grinding could be heard. It was as if it was not horse meat he was chewing, but Chu Yang\u2026On the other side, Chu Yang was clearing the arrows on the ground. He wanted to have a clear area to set up his tent and get a good night sleep.However, after clearing a few arrows, Chu Yang\u2019s face, which was turned away from other people, suddenly morphed into a strange look. Afterward, he immediately took out his tent and stopped clearing the arrows on the ground. In fact, he chose an area with the most arrows on the ground to put up his tent.This made everyone very astonished.Inside the tent, Chu Yang was terrified beyond belief. He had discovered that as he was clearing the arrows, Nine Tribulations Sword point inside him suddenly reacted sharply.At that moment, the sword point followed his meridians and went straight to his hand. The instant it came in contact with the arrows there was a tiny \u201cpop\u201d sound. The arrows in his hand were broken into tiny pieces!Yes, broken into tiny pieces! Or, more accurately, immediately turned into dust!These arrows were made of fine steel!This type of arrow was very lethal and they also could be shot over long distances. This was because half of it was made of fine steel, and the end half was made of the finest iron wood. That was how the arrows maintained their balance.Under Chu Yang\u2019s contact, these fine steel arrows got silently obliterated. How could he not be surprised?After he finished setting up the tent, Chu Yang crawled in. He looked at the ground crowded with arrows, and widened his eyes as he gently touched one with his finger\u2026 (TLN: No floor in this tent. This is Jiang Hu, people!)Sure enough, Nine Tribulations Sword point ran to his finger and suddenly emitted a strong pull. There immediately appeared on Chu Yang\u2019s fingertip a bit of dark iron. The rest of the fine steel on the arrow turned into dust.What has happened? I never heard anything about Nine Tribulations Sword doing this. Chu Yang\u2019s eyes widened with surprise.When all of the fine steel arrows in the tent had become dust, the dark iron scraps in Chu Yang\u2019s hand had become a ball the size of a fingertip.After exercising his internal vision, he also discovered that Nine Tribulations Sword point which was shining brightly now had a tiny spot that had turned black. It was so small that it could easily be missed if not looked at carefully.\u201cHow could this be?\u201d Chu Yang asked himself.\u201cThat is pure iron! Nine Tribulations Sword swallowed iron essence.\u201d That lazy voice from his dantian rang out once again, \u201cWhat\u2019s so strange about that?\u201d\u201cHuh? Pure iron? Iron essence?\u201d\u201cNine Tribulations Sword is the world\u2019s top Divine item. There is nothing it cannot swallow, even the human body!\u201d That voice explained, \u201cBut what Nine Tribulations Sword swallows is the finest part, the essence. With this fine steel, it is iron essence. What\u2019s left behind afterward is pure iron. Even though it is not as good, compared to normal metal, it is already the essence of essences.\u201dThe voice continued, \u201cThis is also a benefit for the Nine Tribulations Sword master!\u201d It paused a little, \u201cOne of the benefits!\u201d\u201cOne of the benefits?\u201d Chu Yang\u2019s head was spinning, \u201cCould it be that there are lots of other benefits?\u201d Chu Yang\u2019s eyes brightened momentarily.\u201cYes, anything that falls into your hands, Nine Tribulations Sword can automatically extract its essence; the part Nine Tribulations Sword doesn\u2019t need will be left to your disposal after it is purified. Once Nine Tribulations Sword is completely restored, all those benefits will be yours. Only, this is a long time from now, you don\u2019t need to know yet.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Chu Yang held the tiny pure iron in his hand and seemed to be thinking about something.\u201cEverything can be swallowed?\u201d\u201cOf course! There are nothing under the heavens that cannot be swallowed, including the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. But for now, there\u2019s only the first fragment of Nine Tribulations Sword so only some metals and medicinal herbs can be swallowed.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026, can this pure iron be used to create weapons?\u201d\u201cGibberish! You only need to have enough, then you can control the sword point to help you make any weapon you want. This pure iron is already a treasure that martial artists in this world can only dream of; do you know that? Using pure iron to create weapon, compared to the trash that you people use, it already stronger by a few dozen times!\u201dChu Yang sat on the ground and thought. At this moment, he suddenly had a clear plan.Going into Iron Cloud Nation through Du Shi Qing was only an impromptu decision! Before this, he did not have any plans. He was just taking it one step at a time, but at this moment, he suddenly had a comprehensive plan!The plan should be like that. The heavy chunk of pure iron in his hand seemed to have given him an idea, making his eyes suddenly light up\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe next few days were calm. The assassins unhurriedly followed behind them at times and parallel to them at others. They were all unhappy, but could not do anything.Their original plan was to kill, but now they were more like body guards.This army of about a hundred was always disciplined and orderly. No matter what locality they were in, there was never any chaos. They were quiet on the road, no one said anything to each other.This army was more like a black flood that quietly follows you!Seeing this elite team, Chu Yang could not help but think to himself: You don\u2019t really need much, all of Iron Cloud Nation only needs ten thousand soldiers like these\u2026 No, you don\u2019t even need ten thousand, only three or five thousand would be enough to sweep over the world\u2026!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Only Chu Yang treated him unceremoniously.However, he knew it was safest for him to stay close to Chu Yang, so even though talking with Chu Yang made him furious at times, he absolutely would not separate and go with someone else in the group.He believed that even though Chu Yang was rude toward him, he was the only one that did not want him dead. As for the others, they might be very courteous toward him, but they all wanted to kill him.A thousand to one chance that they will stab me once they get to a safe place\u2026 this was definitely a possibility!But only Chu Yang will not do something like that!\u201cGood soldiers!\u201d Chu Yang said in a low voice as his eyes glanced in the direction of people and horses that were moving like a black flood.\u201cOf course they are good soldiers!\u201d the man said proudly, \u201cOtherwise, how could they guard the roy\u2026 uh, motherf*! How dare you set me up?\u201dChu Yang quietly rolled his eyes and explained himself sincerely, \u201cYou think I am so low as to try to get you to talk?\u201d He shook his head in disdain and said, \u201cIf I want to know anything from you, I only need some aphrodisiac then there\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t find out.\u201dThe man immediately shuddered. With his mouth gaping, he looked at the youth as if he was looking at an animal and decided it was wise not to say anything else. This was because he suddenly remembered what Chu Yang said the other day: \u201cI will strip you and feed the horses aphrodisiac!\u201dThinking it over, his hair still stood on end. If that was the case, he surely would not have the ability to resist to such thing\u2026Finally, one morning, the group finally saw large city walls far ahead of them.Du Shi Qing and Manager Gao simultaneously breathed let out a sigh of relief.At last they had arrived in the outskirts of Iron Cloud Nation; there were small towns all around, and government offices here and there. There should no longer be the risk of an assassination!Because if Du Shi Qing was assassinated at this place, Tie Bu Tian would be furious! All the officials here would probably not be well off either. Therefore, everyone would treat Du Shi Qing as if he was their grandfather.Sure enough, the citadel\u2019s gate was full of fluttering flags. A group of soldiers were coming from the citadel. Obviously to welcome Du Shi Qing!The group of a hundred still walking on the side simultaneously turned their heads and looked. Manager Gao suddenly turned his head as well, revealing a deadly look in his eyes! If he killed the hostage here, then those hundred people would probably have no way to prevent it!The atmosphere between two sides became strangely tense.\u201cYou should release me\u2026\u201d the hostage said seeing Manager Gao\u2019s ill intent. Before he could finish his sentence, Chu Yang grabbed the fabric that was restraining him and lifted. He flew off with the two hundred pounds hostage.Manager Gao was one step too slow. He could not help but stared at Chu Yang and yelled angrily, \u201cYou\u2026!\u201dThere was sudden a \u201cwhoosh\u201d, the hostage\u2019s form flew out by seven or eight meters. A whistle was heard and a horse sped forward. The warrior on the horse raised his arms and caught the man. Then the horse immediately bolted. That man only swung his legs and he was safely sitting on the horse\u2019s back.The hundred black-outfits in masks cheered in unison. Suddenly, the man yelled out an order, and the hundred people simultaneously halted their horses. After that, they went in a circle around Du Shi Qing\u2019s group. Behind each mask was a pair of eyes filled with killing aura, enough to give people the chills.After they made a full circle, the man laughed and yelled, \u201cYou little bastard, we will see each other again! At that time, I will strip you and feed the horses aphrodisiac!\u201d He yelled triumphantly as if his being a hostage was not a shameful thing but a glorious achievement.Chu Yang was a little surprised. With the thickness of this guy\u2019s skin, he felt a little humbled.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dAfter that, the man\u2019s eyes narrowed and glared in a challenging manner at Manager Gao\u2019s people. With a wave, he turned his horse and sped off leading his men. The warriors behind him followed close behind him forming a black river on the road!The group galloped toward the horizon leaven a large of cloud of yellow dust. In a distance, the man\u2019s laughter rang out, \u201cMotherf*! Have you children prepared good wine for me? I have suffered under the abuse of that ruthless guy\u2026 These past few days, I couldn\u2019t remove my mask; my face is probably as white as those weak rich boys\u2026\u201dThere was a burst of laughter followed by non-stop whistling and yelling; it was chaotic. Clearly, from top to bottom, the group did not see this capture as a disgrace. They did not seem to really mind the fact that they were not able to kill Du Shi Qing either.It seemed that man\u2019s safe return was the most important thing in the world! The fact that the task was not completed\u2026 they did not care.\u201cWhy did you let him go?\u201d Manager Gao raised his head and looked at Chu Yang.\u201cYou cannot walk the Jiang Hu if you do not keep your words!\u201d Chu Yang answered coldly without any compromise, \u201cBesides, I owe Senior Du and I came to escort him. I have nothing to do with you!\u201dChu Yang said slowly with a little disdain, \u201cIf you people were daring enough to kill him right when I caught him, then I would have nothing to say. In fact, I would have even praised you for having great loyalty. Worst case scenario, everyone will become fugitives together. But you waited until you knew you were safe to take revenge. Hahaha\u2026 Manager Gao, the title \u2018Fire Saber Great Master\u2019 did not come from that kind of action, right?\u201dHearing him said that that, the four surviving guards\u2019 faces and ears became red, and could not say a word.Manager Gao slowly nodded his head and said \u201cGood! Good! Good!\u201d\u2026 The word good was repeated three times\u2026 His countenance became more and more serious.Chu Yang grunted coldly and said arrogantly, \u201cSo, did you intended to do away with your savior after you crossed the bridge?\u201d He currently only cared about his target. As for people like these, he did not care for.Gao Wei Cheng was surprised. He glared at him for a while and finally turned and walked away.In the back, Du Shi Qing sighed and said, \u201cOld Gao, what Chu Yang did was not wrong. A man should keep his word.\u201dManager Gao was a distance away. His hunched body paused for a moment and turned around, \u201cYes, sire. Your teaching is true.\u201dAll of a sudden, Chu Yang was greatly surprised!This was the first time he had seen Manager Gao talk to Du Shi Qing. He did not expect manager Gao to treat Du Shi Qing with such respect. This level of respect was that of servant and master.Manager Gao was famed as \u2018Fire Saber Great Master\u2019. This was a little unusual.Chu Yang\u2019s face now showed a pretense of anger, but in his mind, he cannot stop asking himself\u2026 Could it be that Du Shi Qing\u2026 there is something else special about him?After two additional days, they finally arrived at Iron Cloud Citadel. In the little towns along the way, Du Shi Qing was greeted with enthusiastic receptions.However, the attitude of Manager Gao and his people toward Chu Yang became colder by the day. It got to the point where they just detested him. At this time, Chu Yang was all alone like a stray wolf.Chu Yang was generally indifferent to all of this. He spent every day discussing with Du Shi Qing about various medical issues. This was unexpectedly very interesting to him. Chu Yang was very savvy and in some instances he also gave some new ideas, making Du Shi Qing feel very enjoyable as well. Therefore, the two were never bored with their discussions.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euChu Yang used this opportunity to brush up on medical knowledge that he did not understand in his past life. Whether it was in battle or wandering in Jiang Hu, life-saving knowledge was always useful!Du Shi Qing\u2019s journey was basically reported back to Iron Cloud Citadel three times a day. It was even said that the prince of Iron Cloud, Tie Bu Tian, even wanted to welcome Du Shi Qing into the city himself. This type of privilege was definitely grand!The distance to Iron Cloud Citadel was ten miles away!On top of Iron Cloud Citadel, flags were fluttering. Suddenly, a group of well-dressed soldiers came of the gate and stood orderly on two sides. Their lines stretched out for about two miles. After that, a group of riders advanced out in the middle of the two lines of soldiers. After more than three miles out, the riders stopped.The group separated, creating an open space. A youth in a white robe astonishingly appeared. His clothes was completely white, he rode on a white horse\u2026 It was as if, in front of the citadel, there was a snow-white flower blooming. A snow-white ice sculpture; precious as jade, and valiant in appearance! (TLN: I don\u2019t know why they describe guys this way >.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A white robe covered his whole body\u2026 at first glance, he looked like a white snow flower, very delicate and scholarly. But the person facing him got an impression that was completely different from that appearance.He simply sat on the horse\u2019s back, but gave the feeling that he was overlooking the whole world.Prince of Iron Cloud, Tie Bu Tian himself, came out to welcome Du Shi Qing.At this moment, he was sitting with his right hand gently placed on top of his left. His eyes squinted as he was looking ahead, waiting patiently with a calm countenance.From a distance, dust rose up along with the gentle rumbling sound of rolling wheels. A group of people appeared on the horizon.\u201cThey\u2019re here!\u201d Tie Bu Tian said and immediately got off his horse. His robe still covered his body just like before. He was not tall, but never gave the impression that he was small in stature.At his side were dozens of people standing vigilant with light flashing in their gazes. Their hands were on the hilts of their swords, covering and protecting Tie Bu Tian in all directions. With such a formation, even if a Martial Emperor attacked, they could still keep Tie Bu Tian safe and sound!At this moment, Du Shi Qing was stunned.\u201cSenior Du, you have arrived safely at Iron Cloud. I should say goodbye.\u201d Chu Yang faint a ceremonious farewell. He was like a warrior who just finished his mission.\u201cAh?\u201d Du Shi Qing really did not expect that Chu Yang would bid farewell at this moment.Could it be that he only wanted to escort me on this journey? Only a simple repayment? And nothing else?Manager Gao and the four guards were also caught by surprise and raised their heads to look at Chu Yang.Chu Yang gave Du Shi Qing a determined glance and, without waiting for Du Shi Qing to say any words to hold him back, he turned and walked away. His lone figure seemed to be lightened, as if an important burden was lifted!Looking at his back, they all suddenly felt shameful for misunderstanding him.He appeared suddenly and journeyed with them for hundreds of miles. If it were not for him then this group would not have survived to arrive at Iron Cloud! If it were not for him then this group would have been annihilated at that thick forest.But at this hour of success, he decided to leave!In fact, just two days ago, this group almost got into a fight with him! What ungrateful behavior! Chu Yang leaving like this left Du Shi Qing with a deep impression of a selfless hero!Everyone looked at the lone figure as it slowly became a small black dot in front of them\u2026 afterward, it disappeared\u2026 they could not help but be a little dumbfounded.Chu Yang came because he wanted to repay an old debt; this much was verified. However, in everyone mind, Chu Yang should still have another intention.Using Du Shi Qing to get into the eyes of the upper crust of Iron Cloud to win wealth and fame; this was really his main purpose, right?However, at this moment, Chu Yang\u2019s action broke all of their expectations and made them feel that they have \u201cused a small person\u2019s heart to measure a good person\u2019s intentions\u201d (TLN: you probably know it, but just in case, a person with dark heart thinks everyone is like them)\u2026 extremely shameful.What they did not know was that Chu Yang departed at just the right time to start his plan.Manager Gao\u2019s group did not even have one bit of suspicion toward him.Chu Yang knew that if he followed Du Shi Qing into the citadel, he would conveniently meet Tie Bu Tian. However, his status would not be good.At best, he would be one of Tie Bu Tian\u2019s aides. Then he would have to work hard to once again to find or wait for another opportunity to emerge slowly, step by step.But who knows when the right opportunity would come along, and Chu Yang could not afford to wait.What could easily be obtained would naturally not be cherished. The words applied to men and women. They also applied to love as well as wealth and career!A wife was not comparable to a concubine, a concubine was not comparable to a lover, and a lover was not comparable to an unrequited love. What cannot be obtained was always the best. Haha\u2026 Chu Yang understood this too well; in truth, this was not without reason.If Chu Yang initiated contact, then his importance would never be one that Tie Bu Tian had to invite time and time again. His worth in the prince\u2019s eyes would be completely different. Therefore, Chu Yang was currently putting himself in an advantageous position, and creating an opportunity where Tie Bu Tian would have to invite him three times before he comes.Originally, when there was no other way, Chu Yang could only use Du Shi Qing. Now that he had Nine Tribulation Sword\u2019s devouring ability (TLN: it\u2019s really absorption, but the author use terms that mean bite, swallow, devour; sounds more ferocious), he immediately changed his plan. Now that there were other paths, Chu Yang would absolutely not be content with just being an insignificant aide!As for Du Shi Qing, Chu Yang had put all his efforts into leaving a deep impression. The utility of this would definitely not be wasted. At the least, Tie Bu Tian only needed to mention his name with Du Shi Qing. With these impressions, Du Shi Qing would have some effect on Tie Bu Tian\u2019s decision! (TLN: Don\u2019t be confused, basically he wanted Tie Bu Tian to bring up his name with the Du Shi Qing, who of course will only have good things to say about Chu Yang. If Tie Bu Tian asks about him first instead of the doctor bringing up his name, Chu Yang would have more value to Tie Bu Tian.)With the current situation, what Chu Yang needed to do right away was to get Tie Bu Tian\u2019s attention. Let Tie Bu Tian ask about him, then he would be the one that took the initiative and Chu Yang would just be the reluctant party!He only needed Tie Bu Tian to have a little impression of him then his plans can move forward like a horse soaring through the air!Succeeding in one step was a challenge, but doing something strange to attract Tie Bu Tian\u2019s attention, that was his specialty!Tie Bu Tian\u2019s group gathered to wait about 3 miles outside of Iron Cloud Citadel. When they saw Du Shi Qing\u2019s carriage appeared in the distance, they were finally relieved.However, they were suddenly stunned.A figure separated from Du Shi Qing\u2019s group and rapidly approached their direction like a bolt of lightning!No, it was heading in the direction of the citadel!From a distance, it came closer and closer. The time that it took that black spot to turn into a small silhouette of a person to a clear figure to a black bolt of lightning was extremely fast!\u201cSo fast!\u201d one of the valiant looking men next to Tie Bu Tian blinked and could not help but praised.Though the others did not speak, they felt the same way.This figure was not riding a horse, but was on foot. The speed he was approaching with was extremely fast. In a blink of an eye, he was no longer far from them. When he got a little closer, all of the martial art experts around Tie Bu Tian suddenly got an unsettling feeling!Because at this moment, the fast moving silhouette was suddenly moving by them!He lifted his head and looked over in the direction of Tie Bu Tian!The two gazes were like heavenly swords that cut through the dark sky and met!The dozen of martial experts around Tie Bu Tian suddenly felt the moment the pair of eyes felt on them that they were completely exposed.It was as if they were stripped and tossed into an icy field of wind and snow.All of a sudden, a cold like a thousand mile of icy wind swept from the man\u2019s direction. That cold seemed like it could engulf the whole world with ice! It was like a calm sea that was suddenly hit with monstrous waves!An absolute calm turned into earth shattering agitation in a blink of an eye! This sharp contrast made everyone unable to react in time; especially the guards around Tie Bu Tian, who had heightened senses and were always alert!There were martial experts on both sides, the air was filled with tension.However, that person seemed to suddenly sense that something was wrong and immediately took back the cold air. This ability to freely release and take back shocked everyone to the core!At this time, the gazes of that person and Tie Bu Tian were directly on each other!Tie Bu Tian had unexpectedly turned around and looked.Their eyes seemed to have met each other by accident, but they were both shocked!This seemingly casual gaze was actually deliberate on both sides!Moreover, both parties only knew that theirs was intentional.Tie Bu Tian\u2019s gaze was preceded by his activation of Emperor Saintly Technique; it brought with it the type of pressure from one of the ultimate position of power. That was paired with Icy Heart Jade Bone Saintly Technique that he cultivated since his childhood!From one glance, Tie Bu Tian was able to perceive one thing from the other person\u2019s speed, momentum, and gaze. The person in front of him was an extremely dangerous character! If that person was a friend, he would be of great help. If that person was an enemy, he would be a formidable one!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSeparated by more than ten yards, two people and four eyes faced each other. In their mind, there suddenly rose a subtle feeling. As if they should never have met each other; this impossible encounter of friend or foe that should never have been now suddenly meet in this chaos of space and time!Chu Yang was very aware of this feeling. At this moment, in front of his eyes, it seemed as if time and space was grounded and mixed. The two different worlds of previous life and this suddenly mixed together!This was an extremely mysterious feeling.A meeting completely outside of fate!(TLN: here\u2018s something specially drawn for David. it\u2019s even worse than before, drew it 1 minute, hope you like it)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 59 \u2013 A duelOn the outside, Tie Bu Tian\u2019s gaze looked ordinary, but it was actually created by the combination of Emperor Saintly Technique and Icy Heart Jade Bone Saintly Technique. He wanted the other person\u2019s first impression to be that of invincibility, and the feeling that \u2018This person was a heavenly borne king.\u2019He only needed to seed such feelings, then it would be of great help when he solicits this person in the future. Later, cooperation with this person would have a greater chance of going smoothly!At this moment, Tie Bu Tian naturally thought that the other person was simply passing by, that he was unprotected against such a gaze. In fact, whether it was in conflict or just simple conversations, people usually paid attention the eyes of the other person. But who would think that a gaze could have such an effect?And Chu Yang\u2019s gaze was even more deliberate!For this gaze, he even brought out all of the cold energy from Seven Shades Congregation Grounds in the Nine Tribulations Sword point to create an icy atmosphere like a thousand-mile wide field of ice and snow. This gave him an advantage in his aura beforehand, then he gathered all of the thoughts and determinations from his heart for this gaze!This one gaze must give a lasting impression on Tie Bu Tian!Chu Yang\u2019s gaze was sharp, arrogant, and wild like the king of the wolves in northern grassland; sharp like sword and cold as ice. His eyes were filled with ruthlessness!Under this gaze, the living things in the world were like ants to be killed without a care! All of Nine Heavens were no more than grass to be trampled!However, Tie Bu Tian\u2019s gaze was a peaceful, warm and calm like the quiet surface of a pond. Like an ocean accepting thousands of tributaries, limitless domination\u2026 Or it could also be said that he was condescendingly watching over the people from the clouds up high with a regal gaze that got scattered by the wind to the people below!I am the emperor!All under the heaven belongs to me; it is only natural that all shall bow to me!One side was intentional, one side inadvertent but also intentional. Without prearrangement, they have collided with full force!This was a duel of power!But this duel had no outcome. If Chu Yang\u2019s gaze was the ocean\u2019s waves then Tie Bu Tian\u2019s was the rocks. The waves rolled and did not cease to push forth. The rocks stood and remained unmoved.In the end, would the rocks break the waves? Or would the waves cover the rocks? How could it be clearly determined who will win and who will lose?However, that one gaze of Chu yang was like a strong cold wind blown from all directions on Tie Bu Tian\u2019s troop. With a swoosh, he became an illusion that disappeared at the citadel\u2019s gate.From beginning to end, Chu Yang\u2019s gaze never changed.Tie Bu Tian\u2019s gaze slowly recovered, as he seemed to think about something.It was as if it was just a coincidental encounter; a very brief one.In fact, to the people with Tie Bu Tian, this was just a chanced meeting!\u201cThat was really a scary person.\u201d Behind Tie Bu Tian, more than a dozen martial experts with their martial energy activated finally breathed a sigh of relief. Their faces serious. For some, there were even a few drops of cold sweat on their noses. There were some loud pops at their feet. Some people did not manage to control their energy well, so their sudden release of martial energy caused the earth beneath their feet to burst!A moment ago, they felt as if they were tossed into a field of ice and snow, chilling their bodies.Although the person just flew by and there were no actions taken against them, everyone fell into a state of fear as if a sharp sword ripped through the air with intentions to kill with indomitable power that cannot be stopped!\u201cReally scary? How scary?\u201d Tie Bu Tian slowly asked as he looked thoughtfully in the direction Chu Yang just went.\u201cThis person, based on his momentum and his eyes, it could be presumed that he must be the world\u2019s leading killer!\u201d A person in blue next to Tie Bu Tian took a deep breath and continued in a judicious tone, \u201cAt least, this person\u2019s target was not you, prince. Because when he looked at you there was not one bit of killing intent in his eyes\u2026 only indifference.\u201dWhen he said this, more than a dozen people around immediately thought: facing the prince of a country, facing this grand ceremony and being so dismissive\u2026 his resolve and determination was beyond doubt.This group of martial experts could not think of anyone in Jiang Hu like this. This person was clearly very young, at most seventeen or eighteen years old. Of all the talented youths in jiang hu, they could not seem to find one that matched him. Who was this person?\u201cOh?\u201d There appeared a faint smile on Tie Bu Tian\u2019s white jade-like face; he said gently, \u201cA scary person, how truly interesting! He did not see me as a target, then it is very likely that he is not an enemy. And if he is not an enemy, then he could not possibly be a friend?\u201dHe turned around and looked at Du Shi Qing\u2019s carriage. Tie Bu Tan mused, \u201cDid it seem like that person just split up from Physician Du\u2019s earlier? Before that there was no signs of him! Then it must be that he was part of Du Shi Qing\u2019s group, right?\u201dEveryone turned and looked at each other. They could not help but nodded.This was very obvious.\u201cSuch a martial expert was part of Du Shi Qing\u2019s group, then Du Shi Qing must know this person very well.\u201d Tie Bu Tian calmly spoke, \u201cAnd this person was heading into Iron Cloud Citadel\u2026\u201dHis eyes brightened as he laughed and said, \u201cHow could we let go of such talent? Quickly send two people and see if they could catch up to him. Regardless of whatever might happen, no one is allowed to get into an altercation with him.\u201dTwo men behind him nodded and split from their ranks, whipped their horses and rode at top speed. With sounds of hooves thundering, within seconds, they disappeared at the citadel gate.Without turning around, Tie Bu Tian slightly waved his sleeve and said, \u201cFollow me to welcome Divine Physician Du.\u201dChu Yang faced Tie Bu Tian for only a moment before leaving like a whirlwind, but by the time he entered the citadel the tremor in his heart still did not subside and he still had not managed to calm down.\u201cHow could it be?\u201d Chu Yang\u2019s mind was full of doubts, \u201cHow could it be Icy Heart Jade Bone Saintly Technique? How could he know Icy Heart Jade Bone Saintly Technique? It is not strange that he knows Emperor Saintly Technique. It belongs to Iron Cloud Nation\u2019s royal family and has been passed down for generations. But he\u2026 clearly used Icy Heart Jade Bone Saintly Technique as well! Why?\u201dIcy Heart Jade Bone Saintly Technique belonged to the Divine clan. Moreover, it has very special requirements for cultivation. Either very feminine men can cultivate or, for maximum effect, virgin maidens.For masculine men to cultivate this Icy Heart Jade Bone Saintly Technique, they would probably not achieve anything from it in their entire lifetime. What Chu Yang found strangest was, based on the powerful position of Prince Tie Bu Tian, he could cultivate any technique. Why did he have to cultivate Icy Heart Jade Bone Saintly Technique?Regardless, this Prince Tie Bu Tian of Iron Cloud Nation had also left a deep impression on Chu Yang. Especially those eyes: clear as water, cold as ice, but calm and peaceful, benevolent, unimaginably deep\u2026But Chu Yang\u2019s deepest impression was: These beautiful eyes almost seemed like they did not belong in the human world\u2026When his thoughts reached this point, Chu Yang could not help but laugh: This prince seemed valiant, but perhaps too handsome; so much so that he almost seemed like a sissy! An example of white face wealthy young master. (TLN: \u201cpale young master\u201d: rich heirs who have pasty skin from being too sheltered.) The fact that he cultivated Icy Heart Jade Bone Saintly Technique was actually not all that surprising now that he thought it over\u2026Du Shi Qing\u2019s carriage finally appeared in front of everyone. Manager Gao lifted the curtain, and Du Shi Qing slowly stepped out.Tie Bu Tian took one step forward, and bowed deeply, \u201cSenior Du had a long and rough journey\u2026 I, Tie Bu Tian, welcome you to Iron Cloud Citadel.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHis voice was cool and bright with a degree of calmness. Moreover, in front of Du Shi Qing, he actually used I (casual) instead of I (royal)\u2026 showing how he valued Du Shi Qing. From this, it could be seen how this prince of Iron Cloud cared about his father\u2019s illness.\u201cHis Royal Prince is too kind. This old man is not so talented that your majesty has to come all the way here to greet me. I am too fearful to receive such kindness.\u201d Du Shi Qing hurriedly paid his respect, his face showing a little excitement.\u201cYou do not need to be modest. You only need to treat my father\u2019s condition, then you will be a great benefactor of all of Iron Cloud Nation! Whatever privilege is still just ordinary.\u201d Tie Bu Tian smiled and politely stretched out his arm, \u201cSenior Du, this way please!\u201dDu Shi Qing said, \u201cYour majesty, please lead the way!\u201dThen he turned around, heading towards his carriage amidst cheers of the people at the citadel\u2019s gate.

    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 60 \u2013 The prince\u2019s tears\u201cOh, you can say that person is a child of my old friend. Speaking of this person, it cannot be left unsaid that he is really a good person. He is judicious, loyal and filial. He is also courageous, prudent and skilled in martial art. Even though he is still young, he truly a noble man.\u201dDu Shi Qing sadly shook his head, and brought up Chu Yang\u2019s \u201chistory\u201d once again. He was especially emphatic about the ambush. And finally concluded with a sigh, \u201cIf he were not there, then I am afraid I would not have been able to see you today. Moreover, this person is incredibly talented. He is thorough, never forgets, and full of wisdom; he could be called a hero of our day!\u201dDu Shi Qing\u2019s voice was full of respect for Chu Yang. He truly spared no effort in advertisement. Plus his tone was clearly sincere and heartfelt.If Chu Yang had remained with him up to this point, then the result would probably not be like this.Du Shi Qing also has a touch of regret. On the way, he had more than once brought up the idea of taking Chu Yang as his student to teach him about medicine. In fact, when they were almost to their destination, Du Shi Qing poured out his heart, \u201c\u2026 Chu Yang, I feel as if this journey to Iron Cloud would be the last for me. If you still do not accept my proposal, I am afraid all of my medical knowledge will be lost\u2026\u201dWith this much sincerity, and yet Chu Yang still refused.Du Shi Qing sighed dejectedly. Even though he had no hope of having Chu Yang as a student, he still decided to give him his \u201cImmortal Medicine,\u201d his life\u2019s work, as well as an incomplete \u201cMedicinal Herbs Bible.\u201d\u201cThis \u2018Medicinal Herbs Bible\u2019 was created using my medical knowledge. At this point in my life, I am still not able to fully understand more than fifty percent of the medicinal herbs in existence. As for \u2018Immortal Medicine,\u2019 this is my life\u2019s work. If you are willing to learn from it, then good. Otherwise, please help me pass it on to the later generations.\u201d Du Shi Qing seemed to have entrusted Chu Yang with this.These two books became Chu Yang\u2019s biggest unexpected gains during this trip!In Du Shi Qing\u2019s mind, even though Chu Yang did not become his pupil, he still essentially passed down all of his medical knowledge to him. With his superb impression of Chu Yang, he would naturally give his all.Beside him, Manager Gao snorted. He thought that if Chu Yang did really intend to leave them, then he would not have entered Iron Cloud Citadel. However, because he was currently a little sorry toward Chu Yang for misunderstanding him, he felt guilty and did not voice any objections.Anyway, that youth\u2019s disdain for wealth and fame did not seem fake\u2026\u201cSenior Du is truly benevolent; the world is covered with your good deeds. After hearing this, my respect for you has increased by one part.\u201d Tie Bu Tian smiled and said, but his eyes brightened as he secretly noted these two words \u201cChu Yang.\u201dCurrently, it could be said that Iron Cloud Nation was desperate for good people.If it were not for Prince Tie Bu Tian managing Iron Cloud Nation\u2019s military and creating Bu Tian Pavilion to greatly strengthen the country\u2019s power, then Diwu Qing Rou would have sent his army north already!For Tie Bu Tian, he could not afford to let any talent go at this point! Let alone a 'scary\u201d talent like this.Tie Bu Tian\u2019s countenance immediately became cold, and said quietly to the person in blue besides him, \u201cSend orders for Wu Kuang Yun to come to Iron Cloud Citadel. Tell him that if he cannot give me a clear explanation as to why Physician Du was ambushed, then his body need not come, his head would be enough!\u201dWu Kuang Yun, the Great Commander of Iron Cloud Nation, was also in charge of the Southwest Iron Cloud territory bordering Great Zhao! He was ranked tenth amongst the commanders of the continent!While he only ranked last in this list of the top ten great commanders, this was not an honor that could be achieved with just simple bravery\u2026The fact that Tie Bu Tian had brought up Wu Kuang Yun\u2019s name at this moment naturally meant that he had concluded, based on the timing and tactics of the ambush, it was without a doubt Wu Kuang Yun\u2019s doing!The person in blue concurred, but the edge of his mouth could not help but twitch as he thought to himself: Oh, old Wu, you are in such bad luck now\u2026 Although, I also wanted to do what you did\u2026Turning back, Tie Bu Tian\u2019s smiling face was friendly and calm, \u201cSenior Du must have been frightened.\u201dDu Shi Qing continually said he dared not; somehow, when he looked at Tie Bu Tian\u2019s congenial and warm face, he felt a chill down his spine.It was as if that guilty act committed against his medical ethics years ago was placed under the eyes of the person in front of him\u2026Perhaps, could Iron Cloud Citadel really be my final resting place after all? Du Shi Qing stared at the tall citadel wall not too far away, his eyes seemed lost. After that he went back to his carriage. With a calm countenance, he waved the signal to move toward Iron Cloud Citadel.Whether it was a blessing or a curse, he was already here\u2026 What should not have been done was done, and someone would have to take responsibility.A group of people lost in their own thoughts, unconsciously went toward the citadel. After entering the citadel, Du Shi Qing\u2019s carriage went straight to the royal palace.Tie Bu Tian also could not wait any longer. His royal father\u2019s illness had become more serious with each day. He was so anxious he wanted to force Du Shi Qing to treat his father\u2019s illness immediately. As for other national issues, he had tossed them aside.He also knew that being able to invite Du Shi Qing was probably part of Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s plans. He had allowed Du Shi Qing to come here; it was obviously not out of good intentions.He probably allowed Du Shi Qing to treat my father\u2019s condition to weaken my authority.However, even knowing this was a trap, Tie Bu Tian could only happily jump into it! It was his own father! Not just an emperor but his own flesh and blood!That night, Tie Bu Tian did not return to Bu Tian Pavilion until very late.The two people that took the task of following Chu Yang earlier had been waiting for a long time.\u201cHave you found that person?\u201d Tie Bu Tian asked gently. He raised his left arm, which seemed a bit thin and weak, and rubbed his brows, showing some exhaustion.\u201cWe are incompetent; we were not able to find the whereabouts of this man.\u201d One person bowed and said, \u201cAfter this person enter Iron Cloud Citadel, he suddenly disappeared from our grasp. We searched everywhere but was not able to pick up any scent of him.\u201d\u201cSend more people to search.\u201d Tie Bu Tian rubbed his brows and sighed. He switched hands, rubbed his temple and added, \u201cDo not disturb the people. For Iron Cloud right now, even the little bit of strength of the people is important! You absolutely cannot create any sort of chaos.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d they replied, then said worriedly, \u201cYour highness, I noticed you have been overworked of late, perhaps\u2026 we should get someone to help you relax a little?\u201d\u201cGood, call Lan Xiang in to massage me.\u201d Tie Bu Tian did not decline, but his countenance seemed to showed more weariness.\u201cYes.\u201d The two men in black backed down.Tie Bu Tian frowned. He seemed lost in thoughts as his brows came together in worry. Inside his head, Du Shi Qing\u2019s prognosis after examining his father rang out, \u201cYour highness, your father\u2019s illness has gone on for many years. Moreover, the poison still remains in his body. Over the years, it has seeped into his bones and marrow. Medicines or acupuncture would have difficulty intervening\u2026 I can only try my best, but I am afraid it would be up to fate.\u201dTie Bu Tian sighed heavily.Seeped into bones and marrow. Medicines and acupuncture would have difficulty intervening. These words were like sharp cuts in Tie Bu Tian\u2019s heart. \u201cFather, is there really no hope left?\u201dA palace maid named Lan Xiang came in, but when she saw Tie Bu Tian was deep in his thoughts, she dared not disturb and just stood on the side.After a long time, she heard a deep sigh from Tie Bu Tian, there was something glistening on the side of his eyes.The prince\u2026 is crying?This strong Prince Tie Bu Tian, who held the whole Iron Cloud Nation on his shoulders, was now in tears?Lan Xiang\u2019s heart was suddenly filled with sympathy.Only people close to the prince like her would know how hard things have been for him all these years. The price he has to pay in order to race against Diwu Qing Rou!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFrom his childhood until now, these past ten years, the prince has slept less than four hours each day!A whole nation, thousands of thousands of lives depended on him. Diwu Qing Rou and Great Zhao Nation, superior intellect and massive strength, were always like a large mountain bearing down on his heart.If it was someone else, I am afraid this nation would have fallen already!But Tie Bu Tian used his young body to bear this weight!He was too tired! He needed someone to help him\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was because Tie Bu Tian never showed his weakness to anyone!Tie Bu Tian lifted his head and looked at Lan Xiang, his eyes returned to their normal brightness; they did not even need time to change. He had returned to the original splendor of reigning Prince Tie Bu Tian of before!Lan Xiang immediate responded and walked forward gently. The prince is already very tired! What I should do is use all of my ability to make him feel a little better\u2026But after lying down just for a bit, Tie Bu Tian suddenly remembered something and sat back up. His brows came together, and, after thinking for a long while, he said, \u201cSend someone to see If Bao Kuang Lei and Miss Wu Qian Qian of Beyond the Heavens Sect went to sleep already. If they have not, ask them to come here.\u201dHe had suddenly remembered earlier today Du Shi Qing seem to have referred to Chu Yang as: Expelled disciple of Beyond the Heavens Sect!The two words \u2018expelled disciple\u2019 baffled Tie Bu Tian. A person like that, in any sect, would be a top character; guarded like a treasure and nurtured with every available resource. How could he have been kicked out of the sect?I have had contact with Beyond the Heavens Sect\u2019s Master, Wu Yun Liang, several times. He is definitely not stupid like that. Could there be some hidden secrets behind this? Or perhaps some conspiracy? Or some other reasons?Lan Xiang hesitated for a moment and politely replied, \u201cYes.\u201dAt this time, Tie Bu Tian lay down once again. Even when he was lying down, his white cloak still completely cover his body, not showing even a little bit of his figure.Shortly after, the two people, Bao Kuang Lei and Wu Qian Qian arrived.After a long time, as he looked at Bao Kuang Lei and Wu Qian Qian leaving, Tie Bu Tian seemed to be contemplating something as he lay back down.Chu Yang, according to Bao Kuang Lei and Wu Qian Qian\u2019s words, was not the same person as Chu Yang according to Du Shi Qing\u2019s words! As for the expelled disciple story, the two did not know the whole story. They only received news from the sect that Chu Yang killed his eldest martial brother, and thus violated the laws of Beyond the Heavens Sect. The fact that he was not killed on the spot was extremely lenient!Tie Bu Tian frowned slightly. A very long time after, he muttered something unclear, \u201cThis Chu Yang is extremely interesting.\u201d His voice was so low that, besides himself, no one else would have been able to hear it.**********************************************************After Chu Yang entered the citadel, he immediately changed his face a bit. He walked straight and then suddenly turned into a narrow alley. After that, he took two more turns. When he came back out, his appearance was that of a completely different person. He was about thirty years old with a mean face and a slight hunched back.Every step was perfectly imitated; he was just like a real hunchback.It was not that he did not want to be found by Tie Bu Tian\u2019s people; he just wanted to accumulate some capital before they find him. After all, if he wanted to fortify his status, he needed power and money!Therefore, Chu Yang decided if he was going to do this task he would do it well! In broad daylight, he initiated his money-making tactics! But his \u2018tactics\u2019 were a little unscrupulous\u2026The reason why Diwu Qing Rou wanted Iron Cloud Nation so much was because Iron Cloud had countless iron mines! Plus, most of them were fine iron mines! This was also why Iron Cloud Nation could afford to be so extravagant, even arrows of ordinary soldiers were half made of fine steel.It should be noted that even though Great Zhao was rich, but their soldiers\u2019 arrows only had fine steel tips and the rest was wood.Moreover, Iron Cloud Nation was bordering the grassland, belonging to the north. The people were sturdy, strong fighters. If they did not take over Iron Cloud Nation first, Great Zhao Nation, regardless of which direction they sent their military, would remain uneasy because of this thorn in their sight.After exiting a narrow alley, Chu Yang immediately ran into a fat man walking by.This guy had a fat face, big ears and womanizing eyes that glared here and there. His clothes were not too fancy, and his walk was somewhat cumbersome. It seemed that he was not some powerful character that would be difficult to deal with. Plus, beside gazing at the young ladies and women, he avoided others; he was the cowardly type that was afraid of trouble\u2026Step by step, Chu Yang walked like a vicious demon, and grabbed his sleeve. Then he immediately turned back into that narrow alley, pulling that fat man with him.Chu Yang\u2019s action was really fast. As a result it looked like a figure just flashed by and that disgusting fat man disappeared from sight\u2026That fat man was caught off guard so his whole body shook and did not even dare to beg loudly, \u201cGreat\u2026 great man, I have an old mother and young children, this\u2026 this\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat this and that!\u201d Chu Yang glared fiercely and yelled, \u201cI will tell you. I am none other than Five Flower Mountain\u2019s Ma Tuo Zi from outside the citadel (TLN: tuo zi means hunchback)! Today I entered the citadel with the intention of doing some business. I liked the way you look so I wanted to show you a way to make a fortune!\u201d\u201cFive Flower Mountain\u2026 Ma Tuo Zi?\u201d The fat man shook as he looked at Chu Yang\u2019s \u2018hunched back\u2019; scared almost to the point of fainting. Suddenly, managed to squeeze out one phrase by some mysterious force, \u201cGreat\u2026 great man, my lord, there is no Five Flower Mountain outside of this citadel\u2026\u201d\u201cBop!\u201d Chu Yang slapped him and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry whether there is Five Flower Mountain or not. I only have one question for you. Do you want to die or do you want to live?\u201cLive, of course I want to live. My lord, please spare me.\u201d The fat man answered most fluidly.\u201cQuickly, tell me about Iron Cloud Citadel.\u201d Chu Yang said cruelly, \u201cTell me everything. If you leave out any details, I will use your fat for my lamp!\u201d After he finished talking, he clasped his hands together. The sound of his joints cracking immediately rang out; that combined with his ferocious gaze really scared the man witless.Of course, he needed to have a clear picture of Iron Cloud Citadel.The fat man\u2019s body became mush as he sat paralyzed on the ground. On his face, tears and snot ran down. At first, his pants was just wet. Afterwards, there was a stream along with a stinky smell\u2026An hour passed, and Chu Yang quickly stepped out of the narrow alley with his hand on his nose. He went a distance away before taking in big breaths of the clean air.Oh, mother. I almost died of suffocation. That was really stinky.Later in the conversation, that fat man, perhaps because of great fear, started having gastrointestinal issues and farted nonstop while talking and shaking. This made Chu Yang really annoyed!Even though this fat man was not exactly educated, he was indeed familiar with Iron Cloud Citadel!From south to north, from east to west, he gave Chu Yang a very detailed introduction. Even if it was down an alley way, whose daughter was particularly voluptuous, which lady was truly beautiful, whose maid was really flirty\u2026 All told in great details.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThat girl\u2019s skin is white as ivory, the body has beautiful curves in front and back, that b* has seductive almond eyes\u2026\u201dWhich house has lots of money, which house has lots of power\u2026 Divided the citadel into clear areas, where the business districts were inside the citadel, where the mines were outside the citadel\u2026Which house should not be messed with, which house should be avoided, etc.Hearing everything made Chu Yang dizzy. Finally, following the fat man\u2019s direction, he went out to buy a map.The moment he was a good distance away, that fat man shakily stood up on his two fat legs. Like a weak willow in the wind, he leaned on the wall. After that, with dripping pants, he ran. Wherever he went, he emitted the smell of a public toilet, making everyone hold their nose and look in surprise\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Motherf*! That\u2019s just gibberish. Do brigands discriminate cities and villages? Look at that Ma Tuo Zi, his eyes turned green when he heard about the houses with money\u2026\u201dThe fat man cried.That hateful guy not only scared me half to death; he also took my precious banknote along with a few pieces of silver before leaving!He even said he was doing work in heaven\u2019s stead (TLN: justice, charity, etc.). Before leaving, he told me \u2018I take your money to eliminate trouble for you; you need not mind. My heart is good.\u2019Motherf*! If everyone has a good heart like you, all the people in this world would have been dead a long time ago.Brother, I already showed you the way. If you want to find people to do heaven\u2019s work for, or if you want to look for those voluptuous girls, I will not get in your way. I just hope you won\u2019t look for me; I am not rich at all!Fatty prayed as he walked.That afternoon, Chu Yang immediately left the citadel to go to the mining area. If he wanted some iron then he must come here. Before he left, Wu Yun Liang gave him a thirty thousand silver taels banknote. It might sound like a lot, but it was barely anything for buying iron.\u201cSorry, our Iron Cloud Nation has very strict control on iron!\u201dChu Yang had to painfully spend one thousand for \u2018business relations\u2019, in order buy a little iron at a cutthroat price. Of his thirty thousand, more than half was now gone.After only one night, Chu Yang looked at the block of fine iron and was almost in tears.There was no other way, he had to use up the rest of the money. In the blink of an eye, a rich man full of money like him had turned into a pauper. But it was still not enough for what he needed. Chu Yang was angry, his eyebrows pinched together as he dumped his anger into thin air.Money! What\u2019s most important right now is money!\u2018A coin can force a good man to die!\u2019 He used to laugh at this saying and call it a joke. A coin can force an idiot to die, but me? Hahaha\u2026His eyes suddenly emitted a green light, like a wolf\u2019s eyes in the night.The next day, the wealthy houses of Iron Cloud Citadel discovered they had been robbed.The thief was very clever; he visited many homes unseen during the night without leaving a trace. It was still early in the morning when numerous members of the big houses could barely breathe looking at their empty treasury.If a few hundred thousand mice got into a granary, it would not have been so empty! At most, there would be a few scrap pieces left behind! This heartless thief spared nothing, making the owners stomped in such anger that was enough to shake the whole citadel.Their stomps were answered with only dust flying in the air\u2026Gold all gone, silver all gone, treasures all gone, everything was cleaned out! So clean that even a mouse would have cried and left. This thief was too cruel!All the guards did not hear anything, not even a shadow was seen!Amongst the wealthy people, there was old man Li who put his banknotes under his pillow for safekeeping. When he saw his treasury emptied, he thought he still has some consolations. Unfortunately, when he went to check, he was rendered unconscious with a punch. And when he came to, he discovered his banknotes totaling tens of thousands silver teals had disappeared.He also vaguely saw a hunched back\u2026In every treasury, there was a line left behind to show how honorable this pirate was (TLN: I know, he\u2019s not on a ship, but it is literally sea bandit and pirate is the closest thing) . The words were, \u2018The name will never change, rob from the rich and give to the poor, Five Flower Mountain\u2019s Ma Tuo Zi!\u2019Whoever did this really had a heroic air.The next morning, Iron Cloud Citadel\u2019s courthouse\u2019s door was knocked loudly by the many people seeking redress. They were all big bosses who were crying loudly and banging on the door as if they wanted to shatter it for revenge. As time passed, the front of the courthouse became even more chaotic with the sounds of screaming and crying everywhere.The crying sounds were so miserable, making even bystanders shed tears as well.But the officials of Iron Cloud Citadel just sat coldly on the sideline; some even gloated a little when they saw such a scene.These officials simply wrote up a report and sent these bosses home to wait for their news.The reason behind this was that these rich people were not exactly good themselves. They were normally arrogant with their noses in the air; they would sell their morals for money. Even when Prince Bu Tian was collecting money to build the army, these stingy men all said that they had no money to spare and their families were at the brink of starvation.The brink of starvation, huh? Then how could you lose hundreds of thousands taels of silver and gold? You are really poor!You people didn\u2019t have any money, right? What could you have that the thieves actually want? Now you want us to hunt down the thieves for you. Even if we could, we would rather say we couldn\u2019t.Putting everything into the military fund would be best.However, the wanted notice to capture Five Flower Mountain\u2019s Ma Tuo Zi was sent out quickly. This was still a vicious, greedy criminal. Of course, they had to bring him to justice!In one night, fifty to sixty rich houses were robbed, it was surely not just one person. If ignored, the danger would be immeasurable.The entire Iron Cloud Citadel law enforcement were busy for the next few days. During these days, even though they did not manage to capture Ma Tuo Zi, they did grab a handful of petty thieves.Outside of the courthouse, at small corner some distance away, an ornately dressed fat man watched the wealthy people cry and scream to the heavens. His eyes widened, his lips shook, and his face turned blue. It looked like his butt had been sitting on that chair for a long time.God\u2026! This was the doings of that Ma Tuo Zi! I swear what he did had nothing to do with what I said.This thief is too fierce!Luckily, he caught me earlier on. Otherwise, I would probably be of those crying people.In truth, Chu Yang\u2019s actions were very precise. He directly aimed at those stingy people thanks to that fat man. Because that guy was shameless and base, he naturally hung out with birds of the same feather.When his life was threatened by Chu Yang, he did not pay any mind to friendship! Even though there actually were some upstanding business people who were enthusiastic about public welfare, they rubbed people like this fat man the wrong way. Under duress, he blurted out the names that he was most familiar with.The fat man covered his ears from all the crying, and turned his fat butt to go back home. F*! I am now the richest! Haha! You guys normally looked downed on me saying I have no money. Now, haha, who would dare compare themselves to me?Thank you Ma Tuo Zi!**********************************************************Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThree days later, Chu Yang opened an ordinary shop on the busy main street two blocks from the prince\u2019s manor.It was a three-story house; yesterday it was still a tea shop, but today the front had changed. Three groups of workers were busy with the renovations for one day and one night.The old owner thought it was a little weird, but after seeing a pile of shiny gold, immediately cooperated and moved away.How could he not accept? His shop was worth a little over fifty taels of gold, but the other person threw out two hundred taels. Plus, the other person did not want anything inside the shop. With that amount of money, he could easily find a better place to open shop. Not accepting would be foolish.So this place now belonged to the rich and powerful man with the surname Chu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It made half of the street shine with a blinding golden colored radiance.The couplets on both sides were written on silver billboards with gold writings. The entire setup seemed to give off the taste of the nouveau riche. Anyone who passed by would immediately notice a heavy stench of money coming at them head on.On the billboards were: Cutting through steel as if it were mud is not a dream, an eye-opener for you!And below: I (TLN: I, your father,) have all sorts of divine weapons. Come quickly if you want them!Streamer: No need to wait!Leaning against the door, was a sign: Heavenly Armament Pavilion is open to money, those with little silver need not enter. Millions of silver taels is barely enough, a million gold taels does not count as rich. Heavenly treasures are yours to take; the moment you enter you will be satisfied.Evidently, this was not only a nouveau riche, but it looked like he was not that educated as well. An extremely tacky appearance from the house to the billboard. Even the words were crooked and full of evil intent. It was as if a rat\u2019s tail was dipped in ink and wine was forced down the rat\u2019s mouth. Finally, the rat drew those words by dragging its tail after it was dead drunk.Big Boss Chu sat inside waiting, intent on fleecing the fat sheep that came calling. This is called Grand Duke Jiang goes fishing, waiting for fish to willingly and knowingly take the bait. (TLN: Author put in a note to say that, naturally, Chu Yang didn\u2019t know this fishing story. It\u2019s about\u2026 read it here)It should be noted that, preparing for several days and nights was pretty tiring for Chu Yang, but it was also pretty exciting.This taste of unearned wealth really was fantastic. Goddamn, no wonder so many people wanted to be thieves. He only needed to stretch out his hand, and he could take their gold or silver. This was really too easy.Stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. Hmm, it could be also be considered that. At that time they were oozing with money while he was poor to death. Robbing a little for himself, was that not the same thing?The moment this Heavenly Armament Pavilion opened, it made all the people who saw it open their eyes wide in shock. Too arrogant, too outrageous! Since times past no one had ever seen anyone who tried to run a business this way!This was not even about trying to run a business anymore, but purely trying to offend people! Moreover this was tormenting yourself to offend other people.Suddenly, Heavenly Armament Pavilion became the biggest joke since Iron Cloud\u2019s founding, and the name began to rapidly spread out.\u201cHey hey, quickly go and check it out, there is an extreme leveled lunatic opening a shop in bright daylight right over here!\u201dIn a flash, the outside of the Heavenly Armament Pavilion was filled with a large number of gawkers. With nothing to do and since everyone was idle anyway, going to look at this idiot was not such a bad thing.But everyone was also feeling a bit strange. This idiot can show off anywhere, but did he have to come to Iron Cloud Citadel\u2019s most bustling imperial street to get shamed? This person\u2019s brain didn\u2019t go bad, right? But if it really is an idiot\u2026\u2026 where did he get so much money to open this shop?Inside Big Boss Chu sat with his two legs crossed. On the counter in front of him there was not a single divine weapon in sight; the only thing there was a cup of tea, steam and tea fragrances slowly spiraled from the cup into the air. Big Boss Chu\u2019s head was also in this spiral of tea fragrance, nodding from one point to the other. This really was too sleepy\u2026At the left wall near the inner door hung a long sword, a great saber, a short sword, and a short saber. It seemed like these four articles are the only merchandise with which he opened up shop with, and are the \u201cdivine weapons\u201d that he was prepared to sell. On the outside, the chaotic mess of people was at the same time speaking in wonder, sighing, and laughing. Chu Yang turned a deaf ear to this. As the ones he wanted to do business with were not these people anyways.Moreover, Chu Yang\u2019s memory of his past life clearly told him that Iron Cloud Nation perhaps did not care about other things, but \u201cHeavenly Armament\u201d, these 2 words will certainly touch Iron Cloud\u2019s leadership\u2019s most sensitive nerve!\u201cGet out the way! Get out of the way! A good dog does not block the road, this means you! Oh you don\u2019t submit, do you?\u201d In the distance came unreasonable sounds of yelling, a few dark haired large men with unbuttoned collars were walking over this way, the way they walk reminiscent of crabs. Wherever they went, the crowd there was like seeing the plague and scattered to avoid them.\u201cWhat \u2018heavenly armament pavilion\u2019? My god such an upstart.\u201d said a dark haired big man with a face that had a huge mole growing on it, and on this mole there was a long thick tuft of black hair as well. This person used slanted eyes to look at the plaque saying \u201cHeavenly Armament Pavilion\u201d. And with his nose in the air, suddenly and furious yelled \u201cHis mother, is this person poor to the point that he became insane? Not a lot silver, then don\u2019t come in? I don\u2019t have a lot of silver, but I still want to go in!\u201d\u201cBig Brother\u2026\u2026 Big Brother\u2026\u2026\u201d On his side, the smaller man who was just looking left and right surprisingly yelled, \u201cThi- thi- this is all silver! Pure silver!\u201d This guy was pointing towards the plaque while jumping and shouting as if having a stroke.\u201cSilver?\u201d The person squeezed the plaque a bit doubtful, suddenly his tone of voice changed \u201cMy god, this really is silver!!\u201dThe eyes which looked up at the plaque suddenly changed, it become greedy and malicious.\u201cWho is the boss inside? Come out! Come out!\u201d His voice was almost hoarse, his Adam\u2019s apple moved up and down swallowing rivers of saliva. \u201cF* me, I don\u2019t even need to ask for anything else, I only to take away this plaque and it would be enough.\u201d\u201cYou want to buy something?\u201d Chu Yang folded his arms, and slowly came out. There was no other way; in this entire Heavenly Armament Pavilion there was only him alone, for he was both the manager and the worker.The moment he came out to look, Big Boss Chu\u2019s nose almost became crooked from the anger (TLN: erm, another strange idiom\u2026 basically he was pissed off).I am preparing to catch big fishes, but before the big fishes even came I first attracted a group of the local hooligans? This is too f*ing unlucky, isn\u2019t it?\u201cThis shop was opened by you?\u201d That person asked with his nose in the air.\u201cWhat?\u201d Chu Yang was in a bad mood, so his tone naturally would not be good as well.\u201cWhat? My god you really have a temper do you? It seems you do not know who is in front of you do you?\u201d the dark haired big man stretched forth one hand intending to seize this damn kid in front of him by the collar, and give him a beating.\u201cGet lost!\u201d Chu Yang gave a low yell, with a glare in his eyes. Then his two arms rose up and suddenly from his body, burst out a layer of visible black smoke. It contained an overwhelming feeling of evil killing intent and a freezing chill, which rushed toward the other group.That dark haired big man was just a small fry on these streets. Not only that, he was not even a martial pupil. He only relied on his two arm\u2019s strength to bully other people. How could he withstand this soul attack that was at the level of a revered martial artist?The dark haired big man had just finished a word when he suddenly felt a chill, then he was hit head-on by a killing aura that shook his very soul. His two eyes began to roll back, and then he began to feel like he had sunk into an endless nightmare.It seemed as if countless demonic ghouls that were bleeding from many orifices rushed upon him from all directions, from both heaven and hell.\u201cAhhhhh\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d After uttering a scream that was not like any which a human can voice, the dark haired big man staggered back. Suddenly his two hands clung to his head, and he began rolling back and forth on the floor, while crazily screaming, \u201cMercy, no! I didn\u2019t do it, mercy, mercy, ahhhhh\u2026\u2026\u201dHe suddenly jumped up and turned to escape; but in just a single step he fell back on to the ground in a tumble, blood started to flow, and he lay paralyzed on the ground. It seemed that he couldn\u2019t even stand up anymore, but he still desperately crawled forward. As he was crawling away, the crotch of his pants gradually became wet\u2026Only that piercing cry for mercy echoed slowly in the sky.His two younger bros (TLN: not really brothers, you know how it is in a gang) who came along with him did not even understand what just happened, but had seen their big bro becoming like that in a blink of an eye. He had changed from being very normal to being such a terrifying sight, they both felt a sudden chill though the air and couldn\u2019t help but let out a cry. Then, to the left and to the right, they scattered like cockroaches.Chu Yang feigned a perplexed expression to look at the distantly fleeing trio, and scratched his head a bit. It seemed to the onlookers like he didn\u2019t know what even happened. Only after think for a long time did he seemed to have realized something and said, \u201cOhhh right, divine weapons each have a wicked and wild air surrounding them. It seems like they sensed people who had bad intentions in their hearts and that offended the divine weapons inside. All divine weapons have a soul and spirit, so they disciplined them a bit \u2026\u2026.\u201dAfter listening to him explaining so, everyone in the crowd suddenly understood what happened. All of them could not help but show a bit of fear on their faces as they took several steps back. They felt a chill go up their spines.Chu Yang laughingly said, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, I do not know who else wants to come to visit a bit? Please, please, you\u2019re all welcome, don\u2019t be afraid.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWith a rustle, the onlooking crowd quickly dispersed.Chu Yang, with a small \u201che he\u201d laugh, turned back into the shop.Heavenly Armament Pavilion really was terrible, the divine weapons in there each actually had a spirit! If an ill-willed person goes there, they would curse them. This rumor spread even faster than the previous rumor. After all, there were a lot of people who personally witnessed it happening. Thus, it spread out with even more vigor than the previous one. The people who retold the story did it in a low and careful voice; those who did the listening kept quiet with bated breaths.\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t believe this? Did you not see those guys from East Main Street who were scared to insanity? What, you don\u2019t know who those guys were? It\u2019s those hooligans that were raking in protection fees, you know.\u201dSince then, this rumor spread even more excessively. It developed into many different versions, giving this newly opened Heavenly Armament Pavilion, which had opened out of thin air, another veil of mystery.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 64 \u2013 Strange YouthTL: Fallen Editors/TCs: Me & my anonymous editorThat night, Chu Yang was somewhat puzzled. On the first day of opening, Heavenly Armament Pavilion\u2019s assertiveness had attracted a crowd of onlookers; inside the crowd there were also many martial artists, and many affluently dressed people with haughty demeanor, who were very likely the members of some large families within the city.How could these people actually have been able to hold back their curiosity and not come in for a look?It is should be noted that with a sharp divine weapon in hand, you can raise your combat ability at least one level, whether it is walking in the Jiang Hu or fighting in the battleground, it is always a treasure that martial artists could only dream about getting.When one has a divine weapon, its qualities would be far more superior to any other ordinary weapon. It is tantamount to having an extra life!Did this not have enough attraction for them?No matter whether if it was a martial family or the military, this type and level of attraction should be enough right?Chu Yang remained completely puzzled, what sort of thing was this? As far as I know, the moment this Iron Cloud Nation hears of this situation they should\u2019ve been storming in regardless if it was true or not. But how bizarre that nobody actually cares, did I remember incorrectly?On the second day, there were still people gawking. But it was even more deserted than the first day; frankly not even one person went through the doors to enter the shop. At least on the first day, there was a group that came to make some trouble.On the third day, even the onlookers became less. Chu Yang could not help but be depressed. Buying or not buying was one thing, but at least there should be a few people who would come to look around? There were millions of people throughout the city; did they not have any curiosity? In the end, what sort of thing was this?On the third night, there was finally movement.After eating, Chu Yang was looking at the book \u201cImmortal Medicine\u201d that Du Shi Qing gave him; upon opening the title page, there was an opening phrase: \u201cIn this world, who can avoid death? None. Therefore as doctors, one can only heal non-deadly diseases. However what is a non-deadly disease? I humbly believe, that it is those that are inflicted by external forces and cause one bodily pain; those are non-deadly diseases.\u201dAs for terminal diseases, they are one\u2019s destiny.Chu Yang was shocked as he read. The meaning of these words was clear: As long as one was not old to the point of burning out the last bit of gas in his tank, any injury or disease could be cured. Of course this was only in theory. But even if it\u2019s only in theory, the tone was majestic to the extreme.Bang, bang!There was someone knocking on the door.Chu Yang who was just getting immersed in the book, impatiently asked: \u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cI heard that there are divine weapons for sale here, thus I especially came to visit.\u201d From the outside came a tired voice.Chu Yang\u2019s heart moved a bit, although this voice sounded tired, it glowed with a one-of-a-kind type of haughtiness that did not seem to be putting anyone in its eyes. Only people who have become accustomed to being in high places could have such a tone.Moreover, this voice sounded very young.Closing the book, Chu Yang opened the door, in a glance there was a youth in silk clothing standing there, his face calm and yet tired, but within his brows there seems to be an unsolvable light of melancholy. Even after seeing Chu Yang open the door, he still had the same expression.Although this youth was clothed affluently, but his clothing was entirely covered with dust, it actually seemed to be from a long journey without a break. Such a person, with such a haughty tone, but how could he appear to be so pitiful?At the moment that Chu Yang opened the door, this youth\u2019s stomach suddenly let out a sound, it seemed to be from hunger, but upon this person\u2019s face you definitely cannot see the slightest trace of embarrassment.A lamp was lit. There was a lonely glow of light.\u201cPlease sit.\u201d From the guest\u2019s demeanor and air Chu Yang could see that the youth in front of him was definitely not from some mundane family. He was certainly the child of a large family.Because this type of upper class air was not something that those regular officials\u2019 families would have.Spoiled rich kids are of course easily produced by large rich families, but they were also the easiest place for geniuses to be produced as well. Because their starting point was much higher than any hero who comes from the masses.Chu Yang had some doubts. Why had such a large family\u2019s precious child come out at midnight? Why was there not even a single guard to follow him as well? Moreover, why did he appear to be so pitiful?The youth lightly smiled and only after checking out the inside of the store a bit did he take steps to come inside. After sitting on Chu Yang\u2019s opposite, he lightly smiled and said: \u201cWhat is elder martial brother\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cYou want to buy weapons? Or are you here to make friends?\u201d Chu Yang smiled then looked up and asked.\u201cGood!\u201d The youth gazed at him for a moment, before he gently spoke. After speaking, he took off a sword from his waist and placed it on the table. Only after gazing unwilling at it for a moment did he then slowly push it in front of Chu Yang, \u201cSince brother specializes in selling divine weapons, how about looking a bit at this sword of mine?\u201dChu Yang was somewhat speechless. He was there to sell weapons and for three days he had not sold any, nor was there any customer, and now one finally came at night. But listening to his tone, he was actually trying to sell a weapon! Was he actually in the same business? Chu Yang thought his luck really was bad to the extreme.But after thinking for a bit he still reached out for the sword. There was nothing to do anyway, and idling was idling after all.The moment the sword was in hand it felt quite heavy, Chu Yang couldn\u2019t help but raise his eyebrows and exclaim, \u201cGood sword!\u201d\u201cBrother you have not yet pulled it out, how can you already know that this is a good sword?\u201d the gold-clothed youth smiled at him. Although the clothes on him were very pitiful, his every word and move were leisurely, which showed how good an upbringing his family gave him.\u201cCommon long swords are usually 3 feet in length, with scabbard 3 feet 3 inches. But this sword of yours together with scabbard is 3 feet 5 inches.\u201d Chu Yang looked at the sword and said, \u201cFor experts of the sword, an inch longer is an inch stronger, this is specific to swords rather than other weapons. People who says that this saying applies to any weapon are mistaken, because the sword is a gentle killer, it is long but not firm, not firm thus it is brittle, if it is brittle then it is easy to break. Therefore, it is easier to create a short sword; that is to say that creating a long sword is difficult. A sword like yours, being much longer adds to the difficulty of making the sword. But from looking at the scabbard and hilt, old and unadorned with a faint blood aura, shows that it has been through many years, experienced a lot of kills, yet it remains unchanged; there is no doubt this is a good sword!\u201d\u201cWell said!\u201d The youth laughed, his laughter full of appreciation, and said: \u201cBrother indeed is a person who knows swords!\u201d\u201cAlso, regularly a long sword weighs at about six pounds to nine pounds, the ideal heavy swords are weighted at 7.7 pounds.\u201d Chu Yang lightly smiled. \u201cIf mixed with other specific metals, then it is very hard to say.\u201d\u201cBut this sword of yours, with scabbard its weight has already exceeded more than thirty pounds.\u201d Chu Yang said, \u201cA sword that heavy, and yet does not change its shape, is definitely a good sword!\u201dThe look of appreciation in the youth\u2019s eyes became more profuse.Chu Yang\u2019s wrist turned; with a clang, as if were a groaning dragon and a hissing tiger, the long sword exited the scabbard. Suddenly a ray of cold light spread throughout the room; the lamp\u2019s light shone upon the sword actually and became thousands of rays that almost made the entire house transparent in its brilliance!\u201cGood sword!\u201d Chu Yang praised, carefully inspecting it. The more he looked the more the praises came.Blade as still as autumn water. Yet when still, it seemed to be constantly shaking.\u201cObserving a beauty underneath the lamp is a great joy in life; but to those who know swords, seeing a sword underneath the light is actually the greatest blessing,\u201d the youth could not help but sigh. \u201cThe sword has a spirit within, a heart within. To see a sword is to look at the killings in Jiang Hu! A famed sword within one\u2019s eye is like clear autumn water. Groaning dragons and hissing tigers sounds brings to one\u2019s mind an image of armored cavalry stampeding through Jiang Hu!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Chu Yang sighed and said, \u201cTo look at a sword, is to look at Jiang Hu.\u201d He raised his head watching the youth. \u201cBut you and I have never met before. Your coming here today is not to let me take a look at this sword, to feel a bit of Jiang Hu.\u201dWhile talking, sword lights flashed, without even a look Chu Yang returned the long sword to its scabbard, as if the blade itself had eyes.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou really are an expert with the sword.\u201d The youth smiled. \u201cNaturally I am not just here to let you see the sword, I wanted to find a person who loves swords.\u201dHis eyes flashed a pained look. \u201cEver since coming out, I didn\u2019t have a single penny on hand, a journey of eight thousand miles to here, all the items which I had have all been bartered away save only for this sword.\u201dHis eyes looked at Chu Yang: \u201cBrother, I only need a hundred and twenty gold, I will for now leave my sword here as collateral. After a period of time I will come to retrieve it, at that time I will return you ten thousand gold to take my sword back.\u201dChu Yang fell into silence, doubts began to well up.This sword, one only needed a look to see that it was priceless. To put it as collateral for one hundred and twenty gold was more than enough. But he just could not understand why such a good thing came to find him on its own.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This storefront was also there only for his own purposes; to attract people\u2019s eyes and increase his own worth. As soon as that purpose was achieved, then he would immediately close it down.Unexpectedly, ever since he opened, not a single business transaction had been done yet, but this late at night there was actually someone who came here on their own to pawn something? Moreover, it was such a good sword?This event really was strange, too unusual. Could it be that there was something fishy about this?**********************************************************Past midnight, within Crown Prince Manor.The burly stature of Wu Kuang Yun left looking pitiful. (TLN: You guys remember him? The vulgar guy)The moment he came to Tie Bu Tian\u2019s, even without saying a word, everything was blocked at once by Tie Bu Tian\u2019s words, \u201cNo need to explain, I know for sure that it was you.\u201dThen he was just left hanging in there. Standing upright and left hanging for half an afternoon until the evening. This great general who within Iron Cloud was considered so powerful and formidable. In the armed forces, undoubtedly mighty; in subordinate\u2019s hearts, invincible and undefeatable. He was, for the entire afternoon and half the night, continuously wiping off cold sweat.Tie Bu Tian had been constantly approving documents and arranging tasks. Waves and waves of people had been walking in, then the waves and waves of people walked out, everyone was moving hurriedly. Only Wu Kuang Yun stood like a stake in the middle of the hall, motionless.This time it really was embarrassing to the point of death. Wu Kuang Yun looked at the pairs of eyes that curiously watched him. Those surprised, questioning gazes made him feel unbelievably shamed. He almost wanted to find a hole to up into. In particular, several who recognized him and were familiar with him; their eyes when looking at him were like those watching a monkey.Wu Kuang Yun, for countless times, looked at Tie Bu Tian with a gaze pleading for mercy. Brat (TLN: literal is little ancestor, but means little devil or brat), even if you cut off my head, please don\u2019t continue to leave here like this\u2026But Tie Bu Tian did not even spare him a single look; their eyesight didn\u2019t even meet for just a bit. Moreover, he didn\u2019t even try to talk to him.If Tie Bu Tian did not speak a word, then naturally Wu Kuang Yun was afraid to speak as well. This teenage crown prince\u2019s power and influence were still quite solid. The key was the fame and respect he accumulated over the years. This made Wu Kuang Yun respectful of him to the extreme! Thus, he was very afraid.If Tie Bu Tian were switched with someone else, it would be likely that this general, whose temper was notoriously grumpy, would\u2019ve already smashed a table and begun to swear viciously. But in front of Tie Bu Tian, he even had to consider the loudness of his breathing.Tie Bu Tian\u2019s final sentence rescued him from his predicament. Looking at the document on the desk, without looking up, he said, \u201cGo find the army penalty section, give yourself 100 lashes and a year\u2019s fine in pay. All the people who were involved in this matter, is to be treated as such.\u201d Tie Bu Tian looked at the documents on the table before him, without lifting his head said, \u201cI believe that you will not try any mischief again. Get out.\u201dTie Bu Tian did not let out any fury and sounded very calm. But it was just this type of calm voice that made Wu Kuang Yun\u2019s heart tremble. Because this meant that Tie Bu Tian was really angry. If Iron Cloud Nation were not in such a crisis, his head would probably be hanging on a flagpole by now\u2026Heh\u2026, if it wasn\u2019t a crisis, and my brain wasn\u2019t retarded, why would I even do such a thing?After hearing Tie Bu Tian\u2019s penalties, Wu Kuang Yun felt as if he had been granted amnesty, thanked him again and again. With a turn of his body, like a rabbit being chased by a wild dog, he ran out of the Prince\u2019s mansion. Only then did he let out a long breath, with a sound plopped himself on the ground, opening his mouth and loudly sighing \u201cMy mother, finally out of there. This feeling really isn\u2019t much better than just being beaten.\u201dAs for mischiefs\u2026 the thought did not even enter Wu Kuang Yun\u2019s mind. Although one hundred lashes was a lot, but he could still endure it. But if there was more mischief, then the next time it wouldn\u2019t be just a hundred lashes\u2026These kind of things\u2026 Wu Kuang Yun, having learned a lesson from the ancestors, definitely would not dare to pretend to be obedient outwardly while opposing the prince secretly and go piss him off again.\u201cReporting, Crown Prince, we have found that person.\u201d\u201cOh? Where is he?\u201d Tie Bu Tian was just currently looking at the mountains of reports on the table. His right hand was holding a long feathered pen and quickly approved several reports.Although his speed was fast, but each one was looked at clearly, and had been carefully considered. Every approval was sharply written, directly answered. This type of insight; it really does make people gasp with admiration.\u201cEarly today, at Iron Cloud Citadel\u2019s Main Street, there was a rumor that someone lost their sanity due to sheer fright. Hearing this news I went have a look, but for some reason saw the person that Crown Prince was just looking for in a store as its shopkeeper.\u201d The speaker\u2019s face was a bit strange, as if he could not hold in his laughter.\u201cStore? Shopkeeper?\u201d Tie Bu Tian finally could not help it; his hand jerked and the brush smudged an ink spot onto the report.It was really too unexpected; that wolf-like person, how could he become the shopkeeper in a store at Iron Cloud Citadel?\u201cHowever, the store he opened is\u2026 Heavenly Armament Pavilion!\u201d The dark clothed man gave a description of Heavenly Armament Pavilion, and said: \u201cIt seems to be selling divine weapons, but the style is quite mad and quite grand, it\u2019s completely unprecedented!\u201d\u201cDivine weapons? The style was especially grand?\u201d Tie Bu Tian gently put down the pen within his hand, his beautiful eyebrows lightly jumped. Only after a while did he thoughtfully said, \u201cTomorrow, I will go and personally have a look.\u201d\u201cAlso, that rumor of a man who was driven mad because he offended the divine weapons and so was punished by the heavens. But according to my investigation, that person must have been scared witless by Chu Yang\u2019s aura, so that the soul separated from the body, resulting in madness!\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d A light flashed through Tie Bu Tian\u2019s eyes, and asked, \u201cTo simply use one\u2019s aura to drive someone insane \u2026\u2026 what kind of cultivation would you need?\u201d\u201cThis is \u2026\u2026 very hard to say.\u201d the person hesitated for a moment, then said: \u201cGenerally if it\u2019s an expert below the realm of martial great master then, even if it\u2019s against ordinary people, they definitely cannot cause them to faint. This is because aura is after all something unseen and non-physical. And the aura of an expert is something only those at the same level can grasp, however there are always the exceptions\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat exceptions?\u201d\u201cIf the one emitting this aura, is originally the kind of person who can murder without thinking, is encumbered with blood debts, with both hands reeking of blood. This kind of peerless killer, or a warlord who battled year after year, killing without thoughts. Once they release their qi into that kind of fierce and brutal aura, I\u2019m afraid even if it scares someone to death, that would not be surprising. But Chu Yang\u2019s age is very young, so this supposition seems a little ridiculous.\u201d The blue clothed man frowned, distressed. He indeed felt that to use this supposition on a youth who was only in his mid-teen, seemed to be too preposterous. At that young age, how could one murder without thinking?\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Tie Bu Tian let out long sound.\u201cI originally wanted to go in and investigate a bit, but was stopped by members of the Military Ministry. The Military Ministry had secretly blockaded Heavenly Armament Pavilion, not allowing anyone to enter.\u201d\u201cMembers of the Military Ministry?\u201d Tie Bu Tian suddenly smiled. \u201cWere they Imperial Uncle Long Cheng\u2019s men?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt seems like Imperial Uncle will soon make a move.\u201d Tie Bu Tian smiled relaxingly. \u201cNever thought that a Heavenly Armament Pavilion would make Imperial Uncle Long Cheng, who in recent years has always been reclusive, who even I have difficulty meeting, appear. This Chu Yang really is my lucky star. \u201d\u201cAlso, three of the seven sections of Bu Tian Pavilion within Great Zhao has suddenly lost contact. Prince, I\u2019m afraid Diwu Qing Rou has made his move.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTie Bu Tian frowning, thought for a long while, only then did he slowly said: \u201cIt can\u2019t be Diwu Qing Rou, Diwu Qing Rou is not this impatient,\u201d He did not say why it was not Diwu Qing Rou; it seemed like he just came to this conclusion, there was no room for discussion.\u201cIs there any other news?\u201d\u201cGreat Zhao\u2019s southern forces have begun to mobilize. Three army corps have started leaning towards Devil\u2019s Cry Valley. But this event, if looking at the situation, is really a move against Limitless Nation, with no relations to Iron Cloud.\u201dIron Cloud was located north of Great Zhao, the mobilization of Great Zhao\u2019s Southeast Army was thousands of miles away.But once the blue clothed man spoke this sentence, Tie Bu Tian\u2019s expression suddenly became very serious. He murmured, \u201cSoutheast?\u201d His eyes suddenly glinted; he again murmured and asked: \u201cSoutheast, three army corps?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Command Bu Tian Pavilion Intelligence to immediately gather information regarding this matter. Once there is news, immediately report back!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cLet this news be delivered to Imperial Uncle Long Cheng.\u201d Tie Bu Tian added, \u201cSince he has come out, he should know about it. Even if he didn\u2019t come out, he should still know. But he still needs to let me know that he knows.\u201d This sentence came out just like a tongue twister, while saying it, even Tie Bu Tian himself began to smile.\u201cYes.\u201dThe blue clothed man\u2019s eyes suddenly flashed with a light.Tie Long Cheng was Tie Bu Tian\u2019s uncle; the number one royalty below the Iron Cloud Emperor. He was not just a lavishly-cared for prince of a royal household, but also a general! A famous one at that!Amongst the continent\u2019s great generals, he was ranked first! Undefeatable, Invincible! The entirety of Iron Cloud\u2019s military was reformed by him to become strong as a steel plate! How Iron Cloud Nation was able to hold on for this long, besides Tie Bu Tian\u2019s great skills, was due to Tie Long Cheng\u2019s power and great abilities as a general.Two people, one internal, one external, one with the pen, one with the sword, this was the greatest weapon in deterring Diwu Qing Rou!Arrangements completed, Tie Bu Tian gently waved and said, \u201cYou can go, you\u2019ve worked hard.\u201d\u201cYes. Your subordinate will retire now.\u201d The blue clothed man quietly exited.\u201cSoutheast \u2026\u2026 Diwu Qing Rou, do you really want to start?\u201d Tie Bu Tian took in a deep breath, finally taking his thoughts off the matter. Right now, there were other things to deal with. In particular, Heavenly Armament Pavilion.\u201cHeavenly Armament Pavilion\u2026\u201d Tie Bu Tian read out these three words one by one, within his heart a flame began to burn. With that man\u2019s ability, to say such a thing, surely it would not be empty boasts.The one thing Tie Bu Tian was missing right now was divine weapons!This type of weapon might not have much usefulness for regular soldiers, but for Bu Tian Pavilion, which Tie Bu Tian himself set up, such divine weapons were urgently needed!Because a considerable part of the organization were Dead Warriors! And another part were killers who were carefully cultivated for years by Iron Cloud\u2019s royal family!If attempting to kill a target, with a divine weapon in hand, one can increase the chance of success by more than a few percentages! Even if it only increased the chance for success by a tenth then it would be enough for Tie Bu Tian to pay good money for it! But there were no such easy things in life.Iron mines might be numerous in Iron Cloud Nation, but as for high grade weapons, they have always been the weakness of Iron Cloud!Moreover, this type of divine weapon has only exists within legends, never before seen. But now there was actually someone here who opened a \u201cHeavenly Armament Court\u201d?Tie Bu Tian decided, no matter if this news was true or false, tomorrow he would go to have a look for himself.**********************************************************An assassin was a Dead Warrior!For a long time, people have confused assassins with killers. But this a big mistake, for although assassins and killers all have the purpose of killing an enemy, their process was not the same.Once an assassin makes his move, then there must be a death as a result, if not the target\u2019s death, then his own death, or both. To put one\u2019s life on the line, only then can one make the move to kill one\u2019s target. Regardless of the target death or not, the assassin\u2019s fate was to die!Therefore, there were often assassins sneaking into an enemy\u2019s heavily guarded location to conduct assassinations, and regardless of success, once the move had been made, they must see it as if their death was forthcoming. Therefore, an assassin was often called a Dead Warrior!But a killer was not the same, if he was unsuccessful he would flee far and wide and slowly look for opportunities to strike. The emphasis was on protecting himself first, then killing the enemy second. Between these two, there was a fundamental difference!So even if there were rankings within the world, then there would only be a number one killer, never a number one assassin! Because an assassin could not to be ranked. When person decides to be an assassin, he was a dead man walking\u2026**********************************************************\u201cYou may find it very strange.\u201d The youth gently stoked the blade, his eyes full of affection and reluctance. He slowly said: \u201cBlack Dragon is a good sword, anyone who is able to have it, should cherish it and treat it with care. Pawn shops? I\u2019ve already visited several of those. Those people were all blind to it! If I pawned my sword to them, then it would just be insulting to my Black Dragon! \u201d\u201cForgive my bluntness.\u201d Chu Yang lightly said: \u201cIf you\u2019re able to have such a sword, then your skill should not be very weak either, whether through armed robbery or thieving in the night, for you gold and silver should be inconsequential things, why must you pawn your beloved sword?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of talk is this?\u201d This youth seemed like he had just been greatly insulted, suddenly standing up, he angrily said, \u201cWould I, Gu Du Xing, do such a thing?\u201dGu Du Xing!Chu Yang\u2019s startled heart jumped; suddenly, he opened his eyes wide and a stared.So it\u2019s him!His head was suddenly overflowing with memories of his past life. Gu Du Xing, the heir of Middle Three Heaven\u2019s Gu family. An outstanding talent among the younger generation. Rumors had it that this person as a child was called \u201cSword Addict\u201d. His obsession with the sword was almost innate. At the age of three he became a Sword Pupil, at seven a Sword Warrior, a Sword Master at only around thirteen-year-old. And on the year he was Eighteen, he became a Sword Great Master; age twenty-one, Revered Sword Artist! At thirty three, he was already Ninth Grade Sword King! He became the youngest person to try and achieve the realm of Sword Emperor(TLN: highest level for Sword) since times past!This type of cultivation speed was that of incredible legends.Gu Du Xing had created a generation of myths and legends within the Middle Three Heavens.Such achievements, in the entirety of the Mid-Heavens perhaps only the generation\u2019s Evil Prince (TLN: this is a pun of Ao Xie Yun\u2019s name as xie means evil) Ao Xie Yun could compare! Gu Du Xing and Ao Xie Yun were the idols of all the youths within Middle Three Heavens!In the past life, Gu Du Xing was someone that even Chu Yang, the \u2018Poisonous Sword Revered Martial Artist,\u2019 looked up to! A large part of Chu Yang\u2019s determination to reach the peak was due to the influence of these genius!But Chu Yang never could have thought that the Soaring Dragon Sword King of his past life could have fallen down to a point that he even wanted to pawn his beloved treasure sword!This \u2026How does one put this into words?No wonder the name of this Black Dragon Sword seemed so familiar when he heard it; it turned out to be him!The 12 famed people of the time in the Mid-Heavens; \u201cHe Mo (Black Devil) An Zhu (Dark Bamboo) Gu Du Ke (Lone Traveler), Du Sha (Poison Spirit) Tian Ji (Heavenly Secret) Li Xiong Tu (Strict Aggression), Mo Dao (Black Saber) Qian Hao (One Thousand Talents) Xie Gong Zi (Evil Young Master), Meng Luo (Dream Fall) Qiong Hua (Jade Flower) Tian Bu Ru (Heaven Cannot Compare)\u201d(TLN: Yes the English here doesn\u2019t make much sense when put together, but in Chinese it does (sort of) and it also rhymes in Chinese as well. This line is basically 4 poetic lines of the 12 famed people. Despite how this sentence don\u2019t seem to make sense in English, in Chinese it does carry a lot of meaning, for example the 3 ending words Tian Bu Ru- meaning Heaven cannot compare \u2013 is the name of 1 of the 12 people. But in this case, it also caps off the entire sentence, saying that the heaven cannot compare the these men.)These twelve people covered the Middle Three Heavens and dominated all. Each one was an out of this world expert, geniuses among geniuses.Within this group was Gu Du Ke was really this young master Gu, Gu Du Xing!Chu Yang slanted his eyes, looking at this future legend who would traverse the Middle Three Heavens, and in his mind started to do some calculations. Hmm looking at his appearance he is only at around 20 or so, that is to say, he hasn\u2019t reached Revered Sword Artist yet. But he must have already reached Sword Great Master!And at the peak of Sword Great Master as well!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis \u2026\u2026 this is a meat pie falling from the heavens. F*, heaven sent me a powerful man and so rare to get him while he is so poor as well. Of course, even rarer is that I\u2019m so rich, never before have I been this rich\u2026Even so, in Chu Yang\u2019s heart there were some questions. A Sword Great Master, how did he reach this point? A Sword Great Master \u2026\u2026 pawning his own sword? What was this?However, this this Gu Du Xing really was the same as the legend from the past life; just, firm, and upright.Gu Du Xing, walking alone through his life, traversing the world.

He pointed at the four weapons hanging on the wall, \u201cHow about you first check out the weapons I have here and see how they compare with yours?\u201dThen, Chu Yang rose, taking off from the wall a long sword and a great saber, and placed them in front of Gu Du Xing.Gu Du Xing was a bit surprised, his face showed a look of disdain. He squinted and said: \u201cThese sabers and swords of yours, from their looks, they seem brand new, never used. The fact that they have just been recently forged is readily apparent. Their scabbards shine with light and although they look as if they are expensive, but single look will tell that they are made of regular metal. Not worth much money. \u201dThis guy really was direct.\u201cThis type of weapon is basically mass produced goods, for killing a chicken is fine, at best you can use it to fool people who don\u2019t know better\u2026\u201d While speaking Gu Du Xing reached out his hand to grab the long sword. Indeed a true Sword Great Master for he did not even spare the saber a single look. The moment the sword was in his hand, Gu Du Xing\u2019s mouth emitted an \u201coh\u201d sound. The look of disdain on his face instantly disappeared, replaced with great surprise.\u201cThis sword, there something wrong with this sword\u2026\u201d Gu Du Xing muttered, but a shock ran through his heart. This sword was even heavier than his own sword!Chu Yang chuckled, stood up and walked into the back room. This guy is probably hungry, I should probably prepare something for him to eat. As for leaving his weapons with Gu Du Xing, Chu Yang was one hundred percent assured. For someone who would not steal even when starving to death and would rather pawn his beloved sword\u2026 if he could not trust him, then there really were no one else in the world he could trust.Even if Diwu Qing Rou were to steal his sword and ran away, Chu Yang will not be surprised; but if it were Gu Du Xing\u2026 then wouldn\u2019t that be a joke?Carrying in the food after leaving for a while, he saw that Gu Du Xing, who was sitting at the table, was still staring and maintaining a look of being overly shocked. This guy was obviously starving but seemed utterly indifferent to the food Chu Yang carried out, only looking at the sword in his hand while murmuring to himself, \u201cHow could this be possible? How could this sword that has not been watered and nourished with blood be so sharp???\u201d\u201cIs there such thing as impossible?\u201d Chu Yang grabbed a thick iron bar with one hand and grabbed the sword in Gu Du Xing\u2019s hand with the other. Then he shaved the iron bar as if shaving the skin off an apple.\u201cTing\u201d, with a slight noise, a thin piece was shaved off the iron bar. With Gu Du Xing\u2019s perceptive eyes, he could see that Chu Yang\u2019s hands absolutely did not exercise any power.Only relying on the sword\u2019s own sharpness!\u201cTing\u201d, another piece.\u201cTing\u2026 ting\u2026\u201dThe thick iron bar was shaved down by half, on the ground a patch of Iron shavings shined.Gu Du Xing felt his mental state collapsing.He had problems with his family along with other issues and he snuck out, but due to being in a hurry he had forgotten to bring money. Along the way he pawned off most of the items he had carried.Since he was a man and not a woman, he did not wear jewelry. A jade pendant and a few concealed weapons made of precious metals were all he had.But going into pawn shops again and again, made Gu Du Xing completely annoyed by those people. In there, his jade pendant and precious metals actually became a \u201ccrappy jade,\u201d and \u201ccrappy metals\u201d\u2026Can there even be \u201ccrappy\u201d ones for this kind of stuff?So this time, although Gu Du Xing had been hungry for two days, He resolutely refused to go to a pawn shop. For he knew what kind of treasure his Black Dragon was. If those idiots called it \u201ca crappy sword\u201d, then he was afraid that he would really be unable to restrain himself and pull out his sword to kill someone!So he was looking over all the way on the road, only after hearing the rumor that this Heavenly Armament Pavilion had scared a man to insanity, did he tentatively find his way here.After seeing the three words \u201cHeavenly Armament Pavilion\u201d, he suddenly felt very comfortable.Heavenly Armament Pavilion \u2026\u2026 Wasn\u2019t his Black Dragon a heavenly armament? Besides the two words heavenly armament, there really was no other word that could be compared to his Black Dragon!Not even the words heavenly armament would be sufficient to describe it!Because Black Dragon, actually has spirituality!Thus when Gu Du Xing walked in, he had already made up his mind. As long as the other party accepts, he would gather the money in the shortest possible time, and then with the fastest speed, redeem Black Dragon back.Of course, there was a precondition that this Heavenly Armament Pavilion\u2019s boss had to cherish Black Dragon, only then could he be assured!How would he even know that this place that he so casually walked in actually had such a treasure of a sword! The legendary \u2018cut iron as if it were mud\u2019 \u2026 Did I really witness it?Secretly pinching his thigh, Gu Du Xing finally determined that he was not dreaming. In the next moment, Gu Du Xing suddenly became furious!He was angry like crazy!\u201cYou actually put this sword here to be sold to those vulgar animals?\u201d Gu Du Xing suddenly jumped up, his eyes rolled up and stared fiercely at Chu Yang.The rumbling in his belly was getting louder and louder, and his mouth was snarling as well. He was full of rage!\u201cEr?\u201d Chu Yang blinked his eyes a few times.\u201cYou! This is blasphemy! This is a crime! This is an insult to these divine weapons!\u201d Gu Du Xing roared. Directly becoming mad. Seeing the surprised expression on the other person\u2019s face, his heart almost exploded from rage!This type of divine sword was something that, unless they were a superior swordsman, people definitely cannot obtain! They do not deserve it!Was it not said that treasured swords are gifts to heroes and pearls are gifts to beauties? How could ordinary human beings deserve to have these divine weapons?The name \u201cheavenly armament\u201d definitely fitted perfectly!\u201cI will not allow this!\u201d Gu Du Xing jumped up, eyes sharp: \u201cI will never allow this!\u201dChu Yang was stunned. He looked at this person whose stomach let loose sounds of hunger and was almost at the verge of starving to death. This person was jumping up and down in his shop with an appearance of almost being excited to death. He actually disallowed him to sell his own stuff \u2026\u2026this is too much, isn\u2019t it?\u201cUmm, buddy, this store seems to belong to me.\u201d Chu Yang was dumbfounded.Gu Du Xing froze for a bit, suddenly overbearingly said, \u201cWhat is yours? It\u2019s not okay even if it\u2019s yours!\u201dChu Yang was speechless. This idiot, no wonder he advances this fast, looks like he has already been possessed by a sword. This was an extreme obsession, not just a regular addiction.\u201cThis\u2026 this\u2026 this, this is a sword that\u2019s rare to see even once in this world!\u201d Gu Du Xing\u2019s eyes and face even the whole body seemed to exude a frenzied air, \u201cThis is\u2026 This is a perfect sword\u2026 This is a favorable killing tool! Such a sword if piercing a person\u2019s heart, if cutting off a person\u2019s heads, how\u2026 how refreshing would that be?! It\u2019s enjoyable even just thinking about it!\u201dThen while saying he closed his eyes, his hands making sword like gestures, his mouth imitating the sounds. He did not even notice himself, \u201cKa! Ka! \u2026\u2026 This is a real sword! This is what the sword\u2019s fate should be!\u201dChu Yang was dumbfounded, looking at this madman, he immediately placed him in the same ranks as mental patients. Unbelievable, there is actually this kind of people?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Du Xing was so excited that it was as if he was in convulsions, with a loud clang he unsheathed the great saber on the table. Looking at the saber\u2019s shine, this man\u2019s convulsion became more severe, he was quickly approaching the point of severe spasms, \u201cThis great saber\u2026 This great saber is also a rarely seen treasure\u2026\u201dJumping to the wall\u2019s side, with a smooth sound, he pulled both the short sword and small saber from their scabbards.\u201cThis is simply the dream of all the martial artists in this world\u201d Gu Du Xing was already stricken in place; suddenly he stared at Chu Yang with eyes full of grief: \u201cYou you you \u2026\u2026 you actually want to sell these blades?! You actually want sell the dreams of this the world\u2019s martial artists?!\u201dHe stared, approaching Chu Yang step by step ,the muscles on his face cramping, eyes suddenly bulging out like a frog\u2019s and then suddenly narrowed, with his lips trembling, roaring suddenly: \u201cAre you still human?!\u201dChu Yang was thoroughly stunned!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How come it became me selling the dreams of the entire world\u2019s warriors? There\u2019s no need to be this serious, right? If I just sell these blades, then I would actually become the enemy of all the martial artists in the world?If that\u2019s really the case \u2026\u2026 then there really is no way to continue living this life!Chu Yang fell silent for a while, before finally finding an excuse, \u201cGu Du Xing, why do you want to pawn your beloved sword?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I need to eat!\u201d Gu Du Xing\u2019s mind wasn\u2019t quite able to follow; he didn\u2019t know why the other side brought this up.\u201cYes, you need to eat; therefore you pawned the sword that you love more than your life.\u201d Chu Yang nodded, pointing to his own nose and said: \u201cBut what about me? Did you even think about how I also want to eat? If I don\u2019t eat then I will starve to death as well! I\u2019m the same as you, understand?\u201d\u201cIf I don\u2019t sell swords, and I have no other skill, what do I eat? Do I eat people?\u201d Chu Yang asked angrily. The more he said, the more he felt more righteous. He actually started to yell loudly; his spit almost sprayed onto Gu Du Xing\u2019s face.What Chu Yang said was pure nonsense! The plaque outside his door was made from pure gold and silver, how could he even be worried about eating? But Gu Du Xing apparently did not notice, or did not remember it. Looking at Chu Yang\u2019s upset appearance, he could not help but be tongue-tied.Only now did he realize that this guy opposite of him also need to eat.\u201cAlthough you have not displayed your martial abilities yet, but I cannot see through your cultivation.\u201d Gu Du Xing finally thought of something to say, \u201cWith your skills, why do you not steal and rob? At least with that you can fill your stomach right? That is far better than selling these divine blades!\u201d\u201cYour mother\u2019s fart!\u201d Chu Yang, filling with indignation, roared out with righteousness: \u201cAm I, Chu Yang, one of those types of people? These words of yours are an insult to my persistence, an insult to my spirit! A degradation of my will, the raping of my character! I thought that you look like a dignified man, but I never thought that you were this kind of trash! Bah!\u201dThe last words were literally 'sprayed\u201d out.Gu Du Xing\u2019s face was covered with saliva.What Gu Du Xing had just asked of Chu Yang was the same as the one that Chu Yang had asked of Du Gu Xing. At that time Chu Yang was harshly lectured by Gu Du Xing, but now having been asked by Gu Du Xing, Chu Yang had repaid him back with interest! And couldn\u2019t help but feel great in his heart.Goddamn, who in the previous and this life would\u2019ve dared to criticize the Soaring Dragon Sword King like this? I dared!When he remembered his earlier reply, Gu Du Xing suddenly became a bit ashamed. Of course, do not impose on others, what you would not do yourself. Since even he would not do such things then how would this upright youth in front of him do them?He sat in this room of the shop which from the top to the bottom, from the inside to the outside were all made possible by the money that Chu Yang had stolen. And couldn\u2019t help but feel respect; so the other side was the same as him, a real man with conviction and firmness! (TLN: Lol)After all, do they not say that \u201con no road are you alone\u201d? Who says that I\u2019m stupid in my beliefs? Isn\u2019t this a fellow traveler right in front of my eyes? Although Gu Du Xing was mercilessly reprimanded by the other, he suddenly felt that he could really get along with this youth before him.The feeling of meeting a kindred spirit.But\u2026\u2026 but even if it\u2019s for food\u2026\u2026 Gu Du Xing looked at the blades, his heart couldn\u2019t help but feel extreme pain. The muscles of his face twitched; the thought that these type of divine weapons had to be sold was really heart aching.This was not a pawnshop. Once sold that meant it will be completely lost.\u201cThis thing\u2026 how about taking a longer perspective?\u201d Gu Du Xing cautiously asked, \u201cElder Brother Chu, a precious sword like this, and being people who love swords, we should at least look for a good home for them, if money is not yet that tight. I mean, if you can still at least keep living\u2026\u201dChu Yang rolled his eyes and sighed.\u201cThen according to you, what should be done?\u201d Gu Du Xing was stunned.\u201cHow about this? I give custody of these weapons to you, and you sell them?\u201d Chu Yang suddenly had a flash of inspiration, and could not help but become excited all of the suddenly, \u201cYou have nothing to do anyways. How about you just become an employee here? This way you don\u2019t have to pawn your sword anymore, and you also get to eat food and a place to live. The most important thing is, of course, that you can also find a suitable master for these divine weapons, not letting them gather dust somewhere. This is a win-win situation. Elder Brother Gu, what do you think?\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d Gu Du Xing was confused. He really couldn\u2019t think of how, with just some words, he was going to become someone else\u2019s employee?But\u2026 this also seemed like a viable plan. His reason for coming out alone was just to escape; since it\u2019s to escape\u2026 then is not escaping anywhere still escaping?Thinking about the reason he ran away from home, Gu Du Xing could not help but let loose a deep sigh. Haa\u2026\u2026 what should I even do?\u201cWhat? Do you not agree?\u201d Chu Yang asked nervously.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t agree, but\u2026\u201d Gu Du Xing seemed to have something that he couldn\u2019t say.\u201cSince it\u2019s not that you don\u2019t agree, then let\u2019s just do it this way.\u201d Chu Yang interrupted his words, and emphatically concluded the matter, \u201cElder Brother Gu, from now on we are one family. From now on, in this store, everything you say will count! Whoever you say we sell to, then that\u2019s who we will sell it to. Ah, you see, I actually don\u2019t know much about this line of work anyways\u2026\u201dThis remark of Chu Yang\u2019s was the truth; he really doesn\u2019t understand this line of work. He also didn\u2019t mind using this line to make Gu Du Xing stay.As long as you stay, how can you ever run out from the center of my palm? If something happens to the store, can you not care about it? If you dare not care then just watch me hand these swords to some beggars, I will see if your heart aches or not! Since my heart is not going to ache, with the Nine Tribulation Sword in hand. If I want, how many more can I make\u2026Consequently, under Chu Yang\u2019s honeyed words and outright lies, Gu Du Xing confusedly stayed, becoming Chu Yang\u2019s employee. Indeed this guy was sword addict, and while he was already this old, this was the first time he had ever left his home. Plus it was sneaking out as well; he had no Jiang Hu experience to fall back on. Falling into the trap set by Chu Yang, an old fox who had experienced two lifetimes, naturally there was no other road for him\u2026One had to concede that the young ones really are good\u2026 hehe, good and easy to cheat\u2026Naturally, the biggest reason was that Gu Du Xing simply could not see through Chu Yang\u2019s cultivation. In his mind, anyone whose cultivation he can\u2019t see through, then their skill level would naturally be higher than his own. Being the employee of such an expert, and at the same time achieving his purpose of escaping from his family\u2026 this didn\u2019t seem to be all that bad and was not shameful as well.After he wolfed down the food Chu Yang had brought out, Chu Yang had already deftly cleaned out a room and stuffed him inside for the night.Only after the night had past did Gu Du Xing asked Chu Yang, puzzled, \u201cThere\u2019s something that isn\u2019t right here\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Chu Yang rubbed his temples, thinking, could it be that this guy\u2019s brain suddenly started working?\u201cElder Brother Chu, you only said about providing food and shelter, but what about wages?\u201d Gu Du Xing stared and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t just make me work for free right? After all I\u2019m still a sword\u2026 uh, at least I should still get a few silvers each month right?\u201dIt looks like that within this guy\u2019s heart there was still some unwillingness\u2026Chu Yang was madly dizzy for a moment, \u201cElder Brother Gu, in that room of yours, there are two cabinets, did you see them?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Du Xing nodded his head.\u201cThose cabinets hold all my belongings and it\u2019s not locked.\u201d Chu Yang had a look of sincerity. \u201cElder Brother Gu, although the first time we meet and our paths never crossed before, but we\u2019ve hit it off right at the beginning, thus I am entrusting all the belongings in my life into your hands.\u201dGu Du Xing hesitated for a moment, then turned and ran inside.After a while, from the room came sounds of screaming!Subsequently, you could see that this young master of the Gu family came out with shaking hands, moved to the extreme: \u201cElder Brother Chu\u2026 you, you actually trust me this much\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was also a thick stack of banknotes.In this instant, young master Gu\u2019s head was spinning. For a second, he thought he has fallen into the vault of a wealthy mogul.Additionally, he did not expect that Chu Yang had arranged for him to sleep in this room filled with riches, and without any locks at that\u2026 Hmm, the feeling of being trusted when you were at the end of your rope was truly great, truly warm\u2026Chu Yang earnestly raised his hand, \u201cBrother Gu, we have only just met, but we have become close friends. No need to talk about formalities.\u201dHe thought to himself: Besides those, I still have a few more cabinets like that, all filled riches ransacked from more than a dozen wealthy houses. How could there not be a lot? It\u2019s just that I am not using them yet\u2026Gu Du Xing nodded his head repeatedly; suddenly, a question rose from his head, \u201cElder Brother Chu, if you already have so much money, why do you still want to sell these divine weapons?\u201dThe night before he insisted that if he did not sell these weapons then there would be no food to eat. However, with the gold, silver and banknotes piled up in the cabinets like this, how could he explain himself? This stockpile was enough for three lifetimes of living in wealth and debauchery; how could it be said that there would be no food? Was this not laughable?\u201cSorry, Elder Brother Gu. I lied to you last night.\u201d Chu Yang acted as if his ruse had succeeded, \u201cElder Brother Gu, this type of divine sword\u2026 do you think I would just sell it? I saw that it was gathering dust and felt bad for it. So I put it upon myself to find all of them worthy owners.\u201dChu Yang sighed, \u201cSuch a divine sword should be in the hands of the right people. Killing under the heavens, arrogantly traversing Jiang Hu, bathing in the wind and rain of blood, this is how it can show its unmatched character; this is the destiny a divine weapon deserves.\u201d\u201cFor a person to find the right sword for them is already difficult. But for a sword to find the right owner, it is twice as difficult! It is rare to find someone like-minded like Elder Brother Gu so I secretly thought I could now be a little lazy\u2026\u201d (TLN: Fooled you into working for me. Hehe!)\u201cI see.\u201d Gu Du Xing laughed. The knot was undone making him laughfreely. In his heart there suddenly rose the feeling of \u201chero meeting a likeminded friend.\u201d These divine weapons were no longer items for sale. Chu Yang had agreed with me because he valued my worth.It should be noted that the feelings developed after a good impression is definitely different. Because once there is such warm feelings, even if the other person says something wrong, you would still find some excuse for it. Moreover, you would accept such reasoning comfortably\u2026\u201cOf course, finding the right owner for the divine sword is my desire, but I also need to find enough money to eat.\u201d Chu smiled, \u201cMoreover, if the owner of the sword did not pay a great price for it, then he would surely not cherish it.\u201dGu Du Xing nodded sympathetically and said, \u201cThat\u2019s true. I remember when I got Black Dragon, I did go through a lot of hardships\u2026\u201dThe two looked at each other and laughed. Compared with the Black Dragon Sword Emperor who traversed under the heavens in the previous life, the current Gu Du Xing was no doubt less wise, more na\u00efve and youthfully impulsive.Chu Yang naturally knew how valuable the person in front of him was. Gu Du Xing\u2019s stubbornness, love for swords, steadfast principles and obstinate attitude had not changed from his past life.This person was definitely a worthy friend.Chu Yang was not committed to swords like Gu Du Xing was, because, to him, such commitment was foolish. But this did not stop him from admiring Gu Du Xing.This difference in characteristics was the reason why, in his previous life, Chu Yang became a Revered Martial Artist and not a Revered Sword Artist. Even though he used a sword, his abilities were not that of swords alone.\u201cElder Brother Gu, how do my swords compare to your Black Dragon?\u201d Chu Yang asked.\u201cIn term of sharpness, they greatly exceed my Black Dragon. In term of toughness, they also exceed my Black Dragon.\u201d Gu Du Xing thought carefully and replied, \u201cBut in my heart, Black Dragon is unique. These swords of yours, even though they are rare divine weapons, I feel as if something is missing! If I have to choose, I would choose my Black Dragon.\u201dGu Du Xing\u2019s fingers gently rub the sword hilt at his waist lovingly. His eyes showed a sincere feeling like a youth deep in love. While this love was not one that could make countries fall or topple citadels like the famed beauties, it was the only one that could toggle his heartstrings.Of course, he would certainly appreciate and marvel at other beauties, but if he has to find a partner for life, there was only one! (TLN: Still talking about Black Dragon here.)Missing something? Chu Yang\u2019s heart jumped.Gu Du Xing\u2019s senses were definitely accurate. At first glance, these swords were extremely sharp, but they really do lack something. Because all the essence of the material was already devoured by Nine Tribulations Sword and that was the true spirituality of a divine sword.Without essence, these swords were just sticks of steel pure enough to scare people; they definitely would not become divine weapons of legends! Because they would never be able to have spirituality.A sword with spirituality, after killing and bathing in blood, would grow in spiritual aura. However, even if these swords kill the entire world, they would still remain as sticks of steel only.That tiny difference, only at the level of Sword King would it become a large gap. Before reaching that realm, no one could recognize this discrepancy!But Gu Du Xing was only a Sword Great Master, yet with his keen intuition, could feel that something was wrong with these swords!\u201cElder Brother Gu, this is not why I opened Heavenly Armament Pavilion.\u201d Chu Yang thought for a moment and said, \u201cI have another reason, but Heavenly Armament Pavilion must remain. It is complicated and dangerous, so I need your help.\u201dChu Yang smiled, \u201cActually, since the beginning, I did not expect that someone like you would come here. But now that you are here, I will not let you go. I trust you and I especially trust my judgment.\u201dGu Du Xing flashed a sincere smile and said, \u201cGood.\u201dOnly one word, but that was Gu Du Xing\u2019s promise. He could feel that Chu Yang\u2019s words, while he still did not reveal everything, were completely from the bottom of his heart. So he readily agreed.No matter what, one, the person in front of him looked like a good person, and two, this person helped him during the toughest time of his life. That was enough!The two smiled and two palms clapped together. (TLN: First high five in history!) No one could have thought that this clap would become a legend of Nine Heavens later!\u201cI come from a great family of the Gu family clan. I am telling you this, but I am not sure if you can understand the weight of the words Gu family clan. In truth, in all of Lower Three Heavens, there are probably very few people who know about the Gu family clan\u2019s power.\u201d Gu Du Xing held up his cup of wine, a ray of deep nostalgia escaped his eyes. He continued, \u201cI am the adopted son of the head of the clan. After my birth parents suddenly died, my foster father took me in and cared for me with all his heart.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euChu Yang nodded and thought to himself: If I don\u2019t know about Gu family clan, then who would? Such a large clan like that, if I still do not know then I might as well just bang my head against the wall and die!Ah, so the rumors were right\u2026 The future successor of the Gu family clan was really only an adopted son of master Gu, not his biological child.\u201cMy foster father has one daughter and two sons.\u201d Gu Du Xing continued be immersed in his memories, \u201cMy two foster brothers always stayed away from me. I truly never thought about competing with them and taking what\u2019s theirs so I remained submissive. I know that I am only an adopted child of the family, and core power of the family would never belong to me.\u201d\u201cEven if I succeed in the future and protect this clan, not letting anyone hurt them, I still would not become the head of the clan.\u201d Gu Du Xing smiled.

It was because of her that I left home.\u201dGu Du Xing\u2019s gaze seemed to hold bittersweet emotions when he mentioned this girl, \u201cSince we were little, Sister Xiao Miao (TLN: Nickname for Gu Miao Ling, means little Miao and it\u2019s actually older sister. But I think Older Sister Little Miao is weird and a mouthful) was my guardian angel. Regardless of any problems, Sister Xiao Miao always covered for me. Each time my two foster brothers gave me trouble, it was Sister Xiao Miao who stood up for me. What I did not understand, she taught me. What I could not get, she helped me. For my sake, she even went against the clan\u2019s head elder, against her own brothers!\u201d\u201cGrowing up, I was always sheltered under her wings, living peacefully without any worries. Since I was little, each time I was preparing for a breakthrough to the next level, it was her who went to the family\u2019s Medicinal Herb Garden and Treasure Pavilion to find elixirs to help me breakthrough. Many of the elixirs were heaven sent, rare, priceless treasures! It was because of these priceless treasures and Sister Xiao Miao\u2019s constant care that a talent like me became what I am today! My cultivation path was smooth sailing, without any bottlenecks. If I hit a lull, then the power of miracle pills and elixirs turned all obstacles into nothing!\u201d\u201cAll those elixirs that Sister Xiao Miao stole, many of them were not even accessible to my foster father and the other elders. That\u2019s why Sister Xiao Miao suffered countless punishments because of me. As for me, I was clueless and did not know anything. Each time she brought the elixirs, Sister Xiao Miao always told me that these were just sitting around the house, and I took them all like an idiot\u2026\u201dChu Yang quietly listened. He finally understood why Gu Du Xing became such a legend in cultivation at a young age in the previous life. This was the reason.With the powerful human and material resources of the great Gu family clan, could the elixirs collect be ordinary? Gu Du Xing had consumed such a huge amount of elixirs like that, it would be strange if his cultivation speed was not fast.\u201cWe slowly grew up, and because of Sister Xiao Miao fearlessness, she never stopped supplying me with elixirs. From those, my cultivation speed surpassed all my peers. One breakthrough after another, I became a heaven sent talent that all members of the clan noticed. But little did they know that because of this heaven sent talent, Sister Xiao Miao had put out so much effort and suffered so many injustices.\u201d\u201cEven I was proud and arrogant about my talent. I was really too heartless\u2026\u201d In Gu Du Xing\u2019s eyes there appeared a clear bright flash. He suddenly tilted his neck and finished his cup of wine in one gulp. He immediately filled it up again.\u201cUntil one day, Sister Miao Ling, in order to help me breakthrough Sword Great Master, went and took the family\u2019s treasure, Purple Sky Fungus. This made the whole family furious!\u201dGu Du Xing suddenly punched himself hard in the head, \u201cRight at the moment I broke through Sword Great Master, my foster father angrily broke one of Sister Xiao Miao\u2019s legs and locked her up.\u201d\u201cBecause of this, my two foster brothers resented me even more and came to find me to dump their anger. Because I did not know what happened, I gave them a beating. Afterward, they angrily yelled, \u2018You keep hiding behind a woman; don\u2019t you feel embarrassed? Today, you have made Miao Ling this miserable; don\u2019t you even feel a little guilty?\u2019\u201d\u201cShocked, I chased after them for an explanation. This time they did not hold anything back and told me everything.\u201d Drop by drop, Gu Du Xing\u2019s tears felt into the wine cup. \u201cWhen I went to find my foster father, he sighed and told me that because Sister Xiao Miao took the family\u2019s treasure, the clan\u2019s head elder decided to lock her in Dragon Prison Cave! Plus, the term was forever! Purple Sky Fungus was the clan\u2019s treasure. They were waiting for the moment the head elder to reach Martial Emperor to use. If successful, it would help the clan become number one. And after that they would advance into Upper Three Heavens broaden the clan\u2019s legacy! Sister Xiao Miao had stolen it for me and I ate it all. That was how decades of the clan\u2019s preparation was ruined!\u201d\u201cTo the entire clan, this was unforgivable! If another family\u2019s clan at the same level as ours had someone breakthrough Martial Emperor, then the Gu family\u2019s clan would be lost! In giving me Purple Sky Fungus, Sister Xiao Miao might as well have cut off all ties with the family! This error was inexcusable!\u201dChu Yang sighed deeply.At this moment, Gu Du Xing\u2019s description of Gu Miao Ling made Chu Yang think about Mo Qing Wu!These two women were apparently very similar. For their love, they ignored everything! In their eyes, besides their love, there was nothing else worthy of their attention!\u201cI only had one chance to see her with my foster father\u2019s permission. From what I learned, she was sent to Dragon Prison Cave after that.\u201d\u201cWe were separated by a Purple Colored Metal fence. At that time, I cried and cried until my inside felt as if it has broken to pieces. I asked her why she was so foolish. Why? Because of me? It was not worth it. Really not worth it!\u201d Gu Du Xing tears poured out. He picked up the wine gourd and drank in madness. His tears and the wine mixed together as they poured into his mouth.Chu Yang sighed and quietly handed Gu Du Xing another wine gourd.\u201cBam!\u201d With burning red eyes, Gu Du Xing slammed the empty wine gourd on the table, \u201cAt that time, Sister Xiao Miao said to me, \u2018Fool, you are such a fool.\u2019\u201d\u201cShe said, \u2018When you were little, I saw you as my brother and especially treasured you. So I gave you everything that was good. But when we grew up, I no longer saw you as my brother.\u2019\u201d\u201cWhen Sister Xiao Miao said these words, her heart palpitated. She looked at me for a long time and smiled sadly, \u2018Forget it, you should leave. It\u2019s nothing. This is the time I need to go in closed door cultivation anyway. Foolish brother, you are not young anymore; you should start a family. Too bad Sister Xiao Miao cannot drink at you wedding. Go, you should go. Don\u2019t come here anymore. Just pretend you never had this Sister Xiao Miao.\u2019\u201d\u201cAfter that, Sister Xiao Miao turned and went into Dragon Prison Cave.\u201d Gu Du Xing became scary. His whole body shook.\u201cIn my heart, Sister Xiao Miao is no different from an angel!\u201d Gu Du Xing trembled, \u201cI love her. I adore her. I\u2026 I\u2026 but after she walked into Dragon Prison Cave, I discovered that my heart became empty. There is nothing in life more important than her. I cannot live without her! I cannot live without her, ah!\u201dGu Du Xing gave a low roar and looked up. Tears poured down his face like torrential rain, \u201cBut she is now locked up in Dragon Prison Cave. That mistake was too big. I am afraid she may not be able to come out\u2026\u201d\u201cIn the end, is there some conditions in which she could be released? Finding another Purple Sky Fungus?\u201d Chu Yang asked with a calm gaze.\u201cIt\u2019s no use. The head elder heard this news when he was in a key moment of his breakthrough. His mind was in shock and he spit up blood. Not only his breakthrough was unsuccessful, his cultivation actually decreased. He would not have a chance at breaking through Martial Emperor again. Besides the head elder, other people in our family clan cannot reach that level!\u201d\u201cWhat did your foster father say, then?\u201d\u201cMy foster father\u2026 also had no other way.\u201d Gu Du Xing looked blankly into the empty space in front of him. His tears ran down, \u201cAnd like that, I lived as if I was dead for two years. In that time, my foster father arranged a marriage for me\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euChu Yang suddenly understood.It seemed this Soaring Dragon Sword King was not only crazy about swords, he was also crazy in love.\u201cAnyway, even if I have to live a lonely life, I would still not be able to make it up to Sister Xiao Miao!\u201d Gu Du Xing grinded his teeth, \u201cSo I immediately ran away.\u201dNo wonder this person cultivated like crazy in the previous life. With such fast advancement, he wanted to use his own ability to breakthrough to Sword Emperor and free Gu Miao Ling.Chu Yang felt sad inside all of a sudden.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(TLN: normally\u2026) And that girl who would spend her youth suffering inside Dragon Prison Cave was actually one year older than him. In the end, the best years of both their lives would be wasted and could not be taken back.\u201cIf I want to get Sister Xiao Miao out of that cave then I have to reach the realm of Sword Emperor. But that is an extremely difficult task! And Sister Xiao Miao is already twenty-one this year!\u201d Gu Du Xing said in despair, \u201cEven if I really wanted to achieve that realm, I would need at least another three or four decades! In those three or four decades\u2026 How could Sister Xiao Miao bare it? How could she bare it\u2026!\u201dChu Yang looked up and said thoughtfully, \u201cThis problem is not necessarily unsolvable!\u201d\u201cDo you have a way?\u201dGu Du Xing quickly stood up and banged his body against the table, spilling the cups of wine on it. His eyes widened in anticipation.\u201cUh-huh!\u201d Chu Yang calmly nodded and said, \u201cElder Brother Gu, you are involved in this situation so you can\u2019t see it. The foundation of your cultivation is in sword arts, right?\u201d\u201cYou have incredible insights, Elder Brother Chu.\u201d Gu Du Xing\u2019s showed a look of surprise. It was true that he concentrated only on sword arts cultivation and did not pay attention to any others. This was how he could stay focused and advance with the quickest speed!However, no one had ever said something like that to him. This youth in front of him might have many commendable characteristics, but he was still very young. How could he have such potent insights? Even if he was a martial artist of higher ranking than mine, how could he recognize that the basis of my cultivation is sword arts without actually battling with me?How could he know this?\u201cSince you took sword arts as your foundation, you only need to know one phrase: \u2018the sword moves with side stroke\u2019 (TLN: idiom for unexpected winning move)\u201d Chu Yang smiled, \u201cThis unexpected winning move can even cause injuries to you, but once you make your move, it would definitely kill!\u201d\u201cYes, but\u2026 this is cultivation, what do I need to do to achieve this?\u201d Gu Du Xing frowned and thought.\u201cElder Brother Gu, how many people have you killed?\u201d Chu Yang raised his brows.\u201cKill people?\u201d Gu Du Xing\u2019s face changed color. He immediately took a deep breath and said, \u201cSeven! Seven bastards!\u201d\u201cToo few! To become powerful you need to kill enough for a mountain of dried bones. Moreover, this cultivation path is against the natural order! If you want to become Sword Emperor, you need to spend your whole life going through endless wind and rain of blood to achieve that realm!\u201dChu Yang raise his brows, the light in his eyes radiated, \u201cGu Du Xing, if you trust me and place your entire cultivation process in my hands, I definitely can help you achieve the realm of Sword Emperor within ten years!\u201d\u201cTen years?\u201d Gu Du Xing\u2019s two eyes widened, reflecting dazzling rays of light.Ten years was not exactly short, but compare to thirty to forty years, it was certainly much quicker. Besides, ten years from now he would only be thirty years old; it would not be too late.But\u2026 is this true?Chu Yang did not say anything. He only quietly smiled as if he had already given Gu Du Xing an answer.\u201cI am willing!\u201d Gu Du Xing said decidedly, \u201cIf I could free Sister Xiao Miao in the shortest amount of time, then not just ten years, but I be would willing to hand over my entire life to you without any hesitations!\u201d\u201cGood! The deal is done!\u201d Chu Yang held out his hand, \u201cYou only need to listen to me and, in about ten years, I will help the two of you reunite! During this time period, let\u2019s have a happy cooperation!\u201d\u201cWhat should I do now?\u201d Gu Du Xing asked.\u201cIf you are worried revealing your identity, then don\u2019t. First, you can disguise your face a little.\u201d Chu Yang said casually, \u201cThen, what you need to do is manage Heavenly Armament Pavilion in my stead and watch over these precious blades. For now, you need a good sleep and rest your head well. In the next ten years, there will be rivers of blood by your sword! Your enemies will spread over the entire continent! You must struggle at border of life and death and breakthrough in dangerous settings to achieve the unexpected winning move I just mentioned!\u201d\u201cThis is a difficult road; one that you cannot turn back from! But I believe that you are prepared before proceeding! Everything is for the girl you love, Gu Miao Ling!\u201dWhen he heard those three words \u201cGu Miao Ling!\u201d, Gu Du Xing suddenly clenched his fists tightly and emitted a low groan from his throat like an injured animal. Only he knew that each mention of this name was like a stab at his heart.No way back? For Sister Xiao Miao, I have no need for a way back!Chu Yang went to the counter, and quickly grabbed paper and brush. After thinking for a moment, he immediately started to write something on the paper.Seeing this, Gu Du Xing went over next to him and looked to see what he was writing. But in only a moment, Gu Du Xing\u2019s eyes widened. His eyeballs bulged like two eggs!\u201cRevered Berserker Sword Technique?\u201dGu Du Xing said the four words on paper with great difficulties! After that he immediately looked up, his face showed trace of disbelief as he looked at Chu Yang, \u201cThis\u2026 could this be true?\u201dRevered Berserker Sword Technique was the quickest cultivation technique for sword arts. Once started, both body and mind had to stay completely focused until the appointed period; it cannot be stopped before then. This was also the most extreme method of cultivation. Either the body would be completely destroyed or the sword artist would increase level after level.Cultivating Revered Berserker Sword Technique can end in success or death. There was no third possibility!According to legends, a few hundred years ago, this sword technique was created by Sword King Feng Xin (TLN: Closed Heart). He was called Closed Heart but he should in fact have been called Crazy Heart. Everyone agreed that the person who created this type of sword technique must be a madman!Chu Yang got this sword technique in his previous life. During that time, in Middle Three Heavens, someone had discovered the burial place of Sword King Feng Xin. From there, they found this sword technique. But after studying it over for a long time, that person realized that even though this sword technique could help increase cultivation extremely fast, once you reach the last stage of cultivation, you would become a crazy person.Sword King Feng Xin also went crazy and died because of cultivating this sword technique! Many people wanted to change and turn this useless sword technique into a treasure, but no one was successful. That was why Revered Berserker Sword Technique was tossed aside. Even if the sword technique is very powerful, it would be useless when the cultivator becomes crazy!But the content of this sword technique was indeed handed down from Middle Three Heavens.One day, after carefully looking at it, Chu Yang immediately discovered that Revered Berserker Sword Technique and the verse within Nine Tribulations Sword\u2019s third fragment were a little similar. The thing was, Revered Berserker Sword Technique was by far inferior.However, by changing a few key positions in the verse of Berserker Sword Technique, it could be used for cultivation normally. Moreover, cultivating with this new verse will cause speed of advancement to be extremely fast, like crazy.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBut Revered Berserker Sword Technique\u2019s power was not as strong as Nine Tribulations Sword, by more than one grade. Therefore, Chu Yang never bothered cultivating it. However, it did leave a deep impression within him.And right now, it had a use. For a person who loved swords to a fault like Gu Du Xing, this sword technique was perfect!\u201cTake it!\u201d Chu Yang finished writing the last word. He held up the paper still wet with ink and blew on it a few times before giving it to Gu Du Xing. This was an improved Revered Berserker Sword Technique. At this point, one only needed perseverance!Gu Du Xing received the sword technique with trembling hands. This delicate paper had allowed him to find hope in helping Gu Miao Ling quicker.How could anyone not be excited?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Plus his thought was: I am just avoiding a forced marriage and after all, cultivation was the same wherever\u2026! But right now he had absolute faith!\u201cThis sword technique is enough to help you breakthrough Revered Sword Artist in a year! But you can only cultivate to that point and you must stop. Otherwise, you can become immersed in it and lose your sanity.\u201d Chu Yang said slowly, his eyes emitted a sharp brilliance, \u201cPlus, after you breakthrough Revered Sword Artist, we still have other ways for you to quickly increase your cultivation. The path of cultivation must be taken one step at a time. I believe you also understand this principle.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s enough. This is already enough!\u201d Gu Du Xing said as he trembled, \u201cThank you\u2026 Thank you\u2026\u201dEven to his death, he could not believe that when he reached the end of his road, such a big gift like this would drop down from the heavens! Chu Yang\u2019s appearance to Gu Du Xing was like a floating log to a drowning person!This is my biggest hope for quickly saving Sister Xiao Miao from her suffering! Gu Du Xing would sooner die ten thousand deaths than miss this opportunity!Chu Yang smiled; he could finally relax.Of course, he did this because he believed in Gu Du Xing\u2019s incredible abilities. But the biggest reason, at the moment, was the love between Gu Du Xing and Gu Miao Ling. That kind of love was capable of touching the softest spot in Chu Yang\u2019s heart.Mo Qing Wu!Such a love should never be let down! And loving women like Mo Qing Wu and Gu Miao Ling should definitely never be let down!Just then, there was a voice from outside the door, \u201cExcuse me. Is there anyone inside?\u201dThe two men look at each other. And with an \u201cah\u201d, they both jumped up.They have been drinking and talking since early this morning and completely neglected the business. It was now late in the morning, and Heavenly Armament Pavilion was not even open for business\u2026\u201cI will open the door, you clean up\u2026\u201d Before Chu Yang could say anything else, Gu Du Xing quickly grabbed his precious Revered Berserker Sword Technique and ran to into his room like a flash.\u201cMother\u2026!\u201d Chu Yang rolled his eyes and quickly grabbed the drinking mess on the table and tossed it in another room.Then he dusted off his hands and went to open the door.The strong smell of alcohol rushed out the door the moment Chu Yang opened it!\u201cWell, khoff khak khak\u2026\u201d A coughing fit suddenly broke out, in front of Heavenly Armament Pavilion was a young lady patiently waiting. But the sudden of attack of the smell of alcohol in her face made her unconsciously frown.\u201cHuh? You\u2019re here to buy swords?\u201d Chu Yang\u2019s eyebrows pinched slightly.This young lady, even with Chu Yang\u2019s experience, was difficult to describe. She was not a beauty that would cause people to lose their minds over. Whether it was nose, mouth, or eyes; they were all extremely ordinary. But in that extreme ordinariness, there hid a pull that could not be exactly pinpointed.If you only glanced at her in a crowd, then she would not leave any impressions at all. But if you looked at her a little longer, then you would immediately discover that this young lady had many differences from other people.Her face seemed simple at first glance, but after longer observation, everything was hazy. Her gaze seemed mysterious like a dream; her countenance was calm and peaceful. She was clearly a woman, but, surprisingly, carry an aura of a mighty general!Standing in front of the door, even though her figure seemed delicate, anyone facing her would feel as if she was as fortified as a mountain. Unmovable like large mountains and big rivers!Like that, she stood alone in front of Heavenly Armament Pavilion. From the looks of it, she had probably been there for a long time ago. And even though Heavenly Armament Pavilion did not open for such a long time, she was in no hurry. Her countenance seemed indifferent.This was clearly a young lady of only seventeen or eighteen years old, but Chu Yang felt as if she was extremely experienced.Moreover, her eyes suddenly gave Chu Yang a feeling of familiarity. As if\u2026 they have already met somewhere?\u201cExcuse me. Are you the shopkeeper of Heavenly Armament Pavilion?\u201d The young lady\u2019s clear gaze looked straight at Chu Yang\u2019s.\u201cYes, what do you need?\u201d\u201cAh, I came to see if what you called divine weapons were actually worthy of their name.\u201d The young lady said faintly, \u201cWill you not invite your customer in for a sit down?\u201d\u201cOh, you want to come in? You have read the notices at the entrance, right?\u201d\u201cRest assured. Silver and gold is not an issue. It\u2019s not as if I don\u2019t have divine weapons either. Hahaha, but according to the rules of business, I have the right to see what you are selling. So I can judge if they are indeed valuable or just empty boasts. If they are not worthy, then I would not need to spend my money, of course.\u201dThe young lady clasped her hands behind her back and casually walked into Heavenly Armament Pavilion. It was the kind of naturally comfortable attitude she would have if she were walking around her backyard.Chu Yang frowned. There was a mysterious aura on this young lady. In his two lifetimes, he had met many women and never once had encountered such a special aura. This was definitely different!\u201cThese are the divine weapons you were referring to?\u201d The young lady stood in front of the wall with four weapons hanging with her hands behind her back. With her head slightly tilted upward, she looked without any other actions. Chu Yang could not understand why but he suddenly felt as if she was watching over an entire world of her own. Like a king watching over his territory, his own people.Chu Yang\u2019s mind become more and confused\u2026 She is clearly just a young lady, how could these strange feelings emerge like this?\u201cThey are.\u201d A voice answered her, but it was not Chu Yang\u2019s.Gu Du Xing quietly appeared at the corner of the room. His eyes icily stared at this young lady. Even though his face was now a little changed, it kept its iciness as before. It was still essentially expressionless.He did not care to change his countenance because of some young lady.\u201cI can see them, right?\u201d With the sudden appearance of another person in the store, this young lady, unexpectedly, did not show any surprise and just asked casually.\u201cBuying swords here, your status does not matter. It also does not matter how much gold and silver you have. It depends on who you are as a person!\u201d Gu Du Xing said coldly, \u201cWe\u2019ll see if you are suitable for these weapons! If you are not suitable, then even with a whole nation\u2019s wealth, you cannot take any weapons away!\u201d\u201cOh, the sword is choosing the master?\u201d The young lady said slowly and softly, \u201cIn any case, you want to choose the people and I want to choose the sword. If a sword is not worthy, I would not take it even if you begged me.\u201dThese words were definitely aimed at antagonizing Gu Du Xing.After that, the young lady gently reached up and brought the long sword down from the wall. The moment she held it in her hand, she was, of course, surprised by the weight of the long sword. Therefore her arms dropped a bit. Compared to other long swords, this one was three times heavier. It was not until she had a total grip on the sword that her face showed a look of surprise.Long sword?Chu Yang and Gu Du Xing looked at each other; both of them were astonished.Normally, if a young lady was looking for a sword then she would most likely choose a light and portable one. In this aspect, the short sword was much better than the long sword. Moreover, it was more elegant and more suitable for females to carry. Plus, this long sword looked very crude on the outside, full of masculine characteristics.The two did not expect this young lady to look at the long sword first!Then there was a clang, and the sword emerged from its sheath. A ray of radiance shot out.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe girl squinted hers eyes and praised, \u201cGood sword!\u201d After that she slowly pulled the whole sword out of its sheath. With arms at the same level as her shoulder, she slightly tilted the sword, admiring it.Only seeing the angle she was using to look at the sword, Chu Yang and Gu Du Xing recognized that this girl was a connoisseur. Even though she was definitely not an expert sword artist, her knowledge and understanding of swords was probably not inferior to the two of them.Chu Yang search his memory and brought out all the females he met in the previous life and this, but could not find anyone who fit the characteristics of the young lady in front of him right now. As for Gu Du Xing, even though his countenance seemed hard and icy, he was also silently going through all the young ladies from the large families in Middle Three Heavens. After that he was also surprised to discover that those young ladies were probably not as graceful as the person in front of him this moment.This strange young lady, who is she?(TLN: I think we all know this one.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The thread gently touched the sword blade, and the long sword vibrated. A clear and melodious sound rang out and reverberated throughout the whole room for a long while.\u201cIt really is a divine weapon!\u201d The young lady praised. She immediately put the long sword back in its sheath and brought down the great dagger\u2026When she was finally done with looking at all four weapons, she looked up at Chu Yang.On the side, Chu Yang might have seem calm, but he was astonished on the inside\u2026 Since beginning to end, this young lady was surprisingly calm. Even though she was holding a rare weapon in her hand, her eyes never flinched.Certain expressions like 'scared, surprised, greedy, emotional\u2026\u201d that normally appeared during situations like this, were not shown in the eyes of this young lady!True to her words, she simply looked over the weapons. Everything was so very ordinary.Chu Yang could not avoid being aghast. Such state of mind, such cultivation, was this really just a young lady?\u201cWhat is your pricing?\u201d The young lady seemed as if she was thinking about something. When she asked this question, she looked a little preoccupied.On the other hand, Chu Yang was currently trying to figure out this young lady\u2019s identity. Looking at her demeanors, each time she lifted her arms or moved her legs, seemed to carry an air of a superior being. As if giving orders was a normalcy for her. Plus her whole body seemed to exude an innate elegance. She was probably a descendant of some royal family, or at least of royal blood.The strange thing was, how could a person like this went out without any guards at her side? This was unbelievable. Could Iron Cloud Citadel\u2019s security be that good?Before, Gu Du Xing has wandered in here by himself, and now there was young lady who, strange enough, also did the same.Regardless\u2026 If Chu Yang had dared to hang up his Heavenly Armament Pavilion sign, then he was already prepared to receive all sorts of troublemakers. Then he would be able to celebrate in the publicity and use it to advertise Heavenly Armament Pavilion. And finally, his divine weapons would make Heavenly Armament Pavilion the talk of Iron Cloud Citadel and on the front line.Now that he was thinking about it, with the exception of the hooligans coming to make trouble on opening day, no one else had come along.The likes of money spending young masters, unruly young ladies, arrogant aristocrats, and royal family members who wanted to show off that Chu Yang counted on never showed up! In this crowded capital where you can step on three people with one step, he could not believe how empty it was these past few days.How very odd!\u201cEach blade is one hundred thousand gold taels! Or you can put out some precious treasures to trade. Things such as Seven-Star White Magnolia, Nine-Leaf Spirit Root, Purple Air Spirit Star\u2026 I am not very particular. If not those, then Purple Crystal Jade, Legendary Gold Iron, Star Steel, Nightmare Silver, and Diamond Sand would also do. Eighteen thousand pounds of each should be enough. Payment would be expected with delivery of goods.\u201d Chu Yang looked at her with an amused gaze. She clearly did not bring any gold or silver, so he named an astronomical price! This price, even for a country, was gigantic.These were the items the sword spirit told him were necessary for leveling up. And now he brought the whole thing out as the price, giving the young lady a severe shock!Even though her perseverance was more than that of an average person and her mind was firm\u2026 but meeting this guy\u2019s lion mouth, she could not control her anger.Even that dead face Gu Du Xing who was screaming about not selling these four divine weapons was now speechless with wide gaping mouth.With that kind of pricing the term \u201chighway robbery\u201d would not even fit. It was more like killing and taking an entire country\u2019s treasury\u2026\u201cYou don\u2019t want to sell, right?\u201d those two eyes clear as autumn water now turned cold and looked at Chu Yang. But she was really speaking out the words in Gu Du Xing\u2019s mind.Chu Yang smiled and took out a glistening gold bar; after that, he grabbed the sword\u2026 He threw the gold bar on the table and swung the sword down.With a \u201cpow\u201d, it was as if a sharp knife cut through a piece of tofu.As the young lady stared in disbelief, a gold bar turned into more than a dozen gold leaves in just a few seconds. The table was spangled with their golden radiance.After that, Chu Yang reached out his right hand and grasped for a large steel block of about a few hundred pounds. It was originally standing next to the door, but now it has reached the side of his foot\u2026 He brought pointed the long sword down, tip first, above the steel block and gently dropped it. The sword fell down with the tip piercing straight through the block.Sloooosh!The long sword quietly pierced deep into the steel block, burying about half of the blade! Leaving only about a foot of the blade shaking slightly in the bright sunlight that came into the room, and shining with a soft luster.A look of shock was exposed in the young lady\u2019s eyes.\u201cIs it worth the price?\u201d Chu Yang crossed his arms in front of his chest and smiled as he asked.The young lady stared at the sword, her eyes flashed with eagerness.It was true that Iron Cloud currently lacked divine weapons\u2026 but she absolutely did not expect that at this moment, in front of her very eyes, there appeared such a kind of weapon that only existed in legends!Heavenly Armament Pavilion! It truly deserved the name \u201cHeavenly Armament\u201d!\u201cWorth the price! A divine sword like that is truly a priceless treasure. No matter how much money there is, it would still be difficult to buy it!\u201d A voice suddenly rang out like thunder. With that voice was a stately figure that suddenly appeared behind the young lady.The moment that voice sounded, both Chu Yang and Gu Du Xing looked at each other in shock! This was because they did not expect that their senses were not able to detect when the person had arrived. In that case, did it not mean that this person\u2019s cultivation was at least beyond Martial Great Master?This person was brawny with a square face. His eyes were calm but extremely sharp. His brows were large and thick. His mouth was wide, and his nose was lion-like. On his jawline was a three-part, black beard that slightly swung back and forth. He simply stood there with his wide shoulders, giving one the sense that he was carrying the world on them!His body emitted a powerful aura that was enough to send thousands of soldiers running!Without needing an introduction, Chu Yang and Gu Du Xing immediately recognized this man!In this entire Lower Three Heavens, besides the number one famed general, Tie Long Cheng, no other individual could have such a powerful air like this! And only Tie Long Cheng could stand as he please and give the feeling of an impregnable fortress, like a thousand miles of endless mountains that armies would even avoid!The head of Iron Cloud\u2019s military! One of the two pillars that held up the heavens for Iron Cloud Nation. A saint of war in the Nine Heavens continents, Tie Long Cheng!At this time, Chu Yang finally understood why a busy street suddenly became extremely quiet, abnormally quiet. So, since who knows when, a team of elite soldiers in disguise had strictly kept the entire street separated from the rest of the citadel!An entire long, crowded, noisy street was currently quiet to the point a pin drop could be heard!At the main door of Heavenly Armament Pavilion, two people stood emotionless on each side watching the situation inside. Even though he could not discover anything further, Chu Yang was sure that the back door and the roof also had people. Moreover, masters!\u201cIt really is a good sword!\u201d Tie Long Cheng\u2019s sharp, cold gaze glanced at the swaying sword on the steel block and said loudly. After that, he immediately turned and looked at the young lady. Unexpectedly, his expression became soft and completely different from earlier, \u201cWhy did you come here?\u201dAfter that, he asked more specifically, \u201cWhy did you come here alone?\u201d\u201cI just wanted to see.\u201d The young lady calmly smiled, \u201cThis Heavenly Armament Pavilion, I was really curious about it.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhere are your bodyguards?\u201d Tie Long Cheng\u2019s thick eyebrows pinched together. The coldness in his eyes rose up dangerously, \u201cHow do those bastards do their work?! I cannot believe they dared let you go out by yourself like this! Wait till I get back; I will chop them up and feed them to the dogs!\u201d\u201cI snuck out. It has nothing to do with them.\u201d The young lady slightly shook Tie Long Cheng shoulder, pleading, \u201cSecond uncle, I only have this one little secret left, only this one way to relax a bit\u2026\u201dTie Long Cheng sighed, and looked at the young lady with affection and sorrow. He seemed to have let the issue go as he turned to Chu Yang, \u201cDamn little man, these two swords and two sabers, I will buy!\u201dChu Yang hesitated, then asked \u201cWhat are you buying them with?\u201d\u201cOf course I will not buy them with gold.\u201d Tie Long Cheng\u2019s eyes narrowed as he squeezed out each word, \u201cBuying it with your life, would this price be enough?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Chu Yang instantly felt an icy killing aura locking on him.These words of Tie Long Cheng were like a ball of explosives that broke his levee, and the killing aura flooded into the room like a rushing tide!However, there was suddenly another killing aura that exploded next to Chu Yang. Compare to that of the black outfits, this killing aura was much more potent. One against four, and not even a little deficient!At that same moment, Gu Du Xing quietly came right next to Chu Yang!Gu Du Xing\u2019s hand was already on the sword\u2019s hilt, his eyes were bright with a light that exposed a body of martial power that had been concentrated to the max\u2026 He carried a breathtaking air, but he was also perfectly calm at the same time.Gu Du Xing\u2019s killing aura and that of the four black outfits collided making the front of Heavenly Armament Pavilion seemed like an ice cave. That chill even spilled out into half of the street in front.In Gu Du Xing\u2019s eyes, he did not care how powerful the opponent or his position was. Because, to him, the Lower Three Heavens will always be the Lower Three Heavens; it could never be compare to the Middle Three Heavens!Forget about general whatever, so what even if it was an emperor?Currently Chu Yang was his biggest backing and also his only hope to saving his Sister Xiao Miao. Therefore, if these people wanted to cause trouble for Chu Yang, they would have to step over his dead body first!Who cares about consequences; if you people make one move, I will kill you!Tie Long Cheng stared at Gu Du Xing with great surprise, and raised his arm to wave a signal to the back. The four killing auras immediately disappeared without a trace. Only then did Gu Du Xing grunt coldly and take back his own aura. His countenance returned back to an expressionless face, as he stood motionless behind Chu Yang.The four black outfits outside the door might have pulled back their killing aura, but their eyes still carefully watched Gu Du Xing. The fact that such young man like him was able to emit such a powerful killing aura made these four stunned!\u201cVery good!\u201d Tie Long Cheng praised, but he did not reveal whether that praise was for Gu Du Xing or the sword. Afterward, he turned back to Chu Yang and spoke slowly, \u201cSince you opened Heavenly Armament Pavilion, this place was at risk of closing dozens of times! You should know that if I did not give orders to protect this shop early on, it would have already been reduced to dusts and ashes!\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Chu Yang asked acting as if he was surprised. Internally, he was thinking no wonder no one came, this damn old man secretly caused mischief. Old man, you ruined my plan, and dared to take credit?\u201cAll because of these two words, heavenly armament!\u201d Tie Long Cheng suddenly tilted his head and looked straight at Chu Yang, \u201cYou openly put these two words on your shop\u2019s sign right on the biggest street of Iron Cloud Citadel. This proved that you have given this much thought and that you have great insights. You have grasped the true weakness of Iron Cloud Nation! I came here to see what your true motives are! In truth, even if this little shop was filled with divine weapons, I could care less!\u201d\u201cWhat motives?\u201d After hearing these words, the young lady next to Tie Long Cheng could not help but turn and look at Chu Yang.\u201cYes, this person definitely has ulterior motives! But if it was just ulterior motives, then it was still not worth my coming here!\u201d Tie Long Cheng clasped his hands behind his back and said, \u201cI personally came here because I have my reasons. But the most important thing was to stop all who were interested in this Heavenly Armament Pavilion! Regardless of who, once they have come here, they could be used by this shop owner to further his own agenda! Even though I also don\u2019t know what his real agenda is, I only need to blockade this whole place and his plan will fall apart!\u201d\u201cThe purpose of this shop was not to sell weapons, but to create publicity!\u201d Tie Long Cheng coldly concluded, exposing Chu Yang\u2019s plan in the open.\u201cA total blockade is the simplest and most effective tactic. If it was at a different time, then I would have left him to do whatever he wanted. But currently, Diwu Qing Rou has started some movements in the Southwest. This is why I cannot ignore any little ambiguous actions!\u201dThese words of Tie Long Cheng made Chu Yang extremely shocked. Cold sweats ran down his back.Whoever said the people in this world are fools? This Tie Long Cheng is really scary!Even though he does not know my exact plans, his simple blockade tactic has ruined my plans completely. I have no way of moving further.\u201cDiwu Qing Rou\u2019s plans for Iron Cloud Nation started 10 years ago. At that time, there was suddenly a large number of killers sneaking into Iron Cloud Nation. The strange thing was, they did not kill any royal members or officials. Instead, they killed the famous blacksmiths of Iron Cloud Nation, creating a wave of bloody wind and rain.\u201dTie Long Cheng\u2019s eyes became sharp as a needle, \u201cEven now, all these cases are still left as unsolved. From the most skilled blacksmiths who were capable of creating the highest quality weapons to apprentices who were just learning the craft, none were spared! In fact, even military blacksmiths died one after another, suddenly and mysteriously. From top to bottom, more than thirty thousand blacksmiths from Iron Cloud Nation were killed! Especially those blacksmiths at the level of master craftsmen, none were lucky enough to be spared!\u201d\u201cIron Cloud Nation was famous as a nation with the most mines in the entire continent, but it has not one blacksmith! Such a funny situation actually happened!\u201dTie Long Cheng sighed and said, \u201cThe most hateful thing was that those damned officials in the justice department only saw these cases as ordinary, and just went through the motions!\u201d\u201cIt was not until three of our biggest weapons dealers in Great Zhao and seventeen secret weapon suppliers in other nations were completely destroyed right down to the roots, that everyone realized this would shake the country to its core. But it was too late.\u201d\u201cThe cruelest thing was the places of those master blacksmiths were also burned to the ground. The life\u2019s work and legacy was destroyed in only a moment. You can say that all the precious smithing knowledge passed down to now is only a handful!\u201dChu Yang was shocked after hearing this.So this is why Iron Cloud Nation does not even have one blacksmith!This one drastic move of Diwu Qing Rou was indeed sinister! In the beginning, the deaths of a few blacksmiths did not get the attentions of the higher ups of Iron Cloud Nation. By the time they took notice, this massacre was already coming to an end.Because of Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s ambitions, tens of thousands of lives were destroyed in such short time! Plus, until now, the officials could not find any evidence whatsoever. This type of massive tactic was shocking!After this massacre, if Great Zhao took over Iron Cloud Nation, they would not have to worry about an uprising! How many blacksmiths could a country have? Because Iron Cloud Nation was a place with many ore mines, skilled blacksmiths gathered there in great numbers. But after this, how many were left?Even young men who had the intentions of learning this craft would abandon such thoughts once they learned of what had happened.Weapons, this was the key. Without weapons, what would they fight with? With their hands? What a joke!The more he thought about it, the more bone-chilling it was. This was the lives of tens of thousands of people not pieces of wood. Even the blacksmiths who had nothing to do with the wars. This was pure brutal murder!A person who could give such orders. How cruel, how unscrupulous, how mad?!Not long after this massacre, Great Zhao fell under the leadership of Diwu Qing Rou and started to continually go to war with Iron Cloud. Each year, the two countries, Great Zhao and Iron Cloud, fought with each other countless times. Of course, because of this, the supply of weapons could not meet the demands of war. And at these key periods, Iron Cloud Nation had no blacksmiths to make weapons for the soldiers.At first glance, these incidents were just brutal killings of the innocent, but who could have known that this would determine the outcome of a war between two nations?\u201cWar is nonstop, fighting and killing goes on without end\u2026 But Iron Cloud Nation, famous for having the most ore mines, with the highest quality iron ores, was unable to create decent weapons! Generals and commanders were weakened by the use of mediocre weapons. They could not find a decent weapon that suited them and were stuck with using ordinary weapons like soldiers!\u201d\u201cBasic soldiers were not affected because they have always used ordinary weapons. However, who would have thought that, by killing all the blacksmiths, they were actually aiming at the military leaders of Iron Cloud?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTie Long Cheng growled, \u201cA person capable of using weapons weighing eighty pounds was forced to use weapons weighing only eight pounds. Plus, these weapons would shatter upon contact with the enemy\u2019s weapons\u2026 Would this not drop their ability to fight down more than one level? This is the key reason why Iron Cloud Nation could only defend, but never have the ability to end the invasion!\u201d\u201cOn the battlefield, soldiers held these inferior weapons to fight with the enemies, only to their weapons shatter on contact! It was such a joke! Yet so many brave men died tragically under the hands of enemies inferior to them!\u201d\u201cSo Iron Cloud Nation continually lost on the battlefield! Even though all the soldiers tried their hardest to kill the enemies, they could not change the tides of battle! In the end, they could only watch as seven provinces and forty-eight towns become part of Great Zhao. And Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s fame grew from there!\u201d\u201cFor eight years, Iron Cloud Nation tried its best to nurture new blacksmiths, but could not make up for that lost. Moreover, all those brothers lost in battle will never return! So high quality weapons were Iron Cloud Nation\u2019s biggest pain! But now, you dared erected Heavenly Armament Pavilion on the busiest street of Iron Cloud Citadel?\u201dTie Long Cheng looked coldly at Chu Yang, \u201cThese two words \u2018heavenly armament\u2019 touched Iron Cloud Nation\u2019s most sensitive nerve! Speak! What are your motives?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Do you know how many people died in anguish right in front of me? They were all Iron Cloud\u2019s heroes!\u201dChu Yang finally understood why this high ranking guest came here himself and why he gave the order to block off Heavenly Armament Pavilion. So my actions had accidentally reopened his old wounds!Even though Tie Long Cheng\u2019s appearance seemed relatively calm, but Chu Yang could feel that this famed general was filled with sorrow and anguish!Chu Yang knew that Iron Cloud was in desperate need of blacksmiths. Many weapons were bought from Limitless Nation at cutthroat prices. However, he did not expect that all of this had to do with a most inhumane scheme!\u201cGeneral Tie\u2019s insight is indeed sharp!\u201d Chu Yang smiled.\u201cIn that case, are you admitting that you are a spy sent to Diwu Qing Rou?\u201d\u201cAdmit?\u201d Chu Yang smiled, \u201cIf I was really working for Diwu Qing Rou, why would I use such an open method to spy?\u201dTie Long Cheng eyes fixed on Chu Yang, then he said coldly, \u201cWhatever that\u2019s done, must have its own reasons.\u201d\u201cI dislike Diwu Qing Rou; is that reason enough?\u201d Chu Yang smiled. Suddenly, his body flashed and he was at the main door. With incredible speed, he charged at one of the guards in the group. He attacked without any warning. A second ago, he was talking and smiling with Tie Long Cheng, and in the blink of an eye, his fist had almost connected with that guard\u2019s throat.That person turned his body in shock as the other three pulled out their swords. The three sword points were like venomous vipers springing at Chu Yang\u2019s direction.All four were experts, and worked in concert with each other. When one of them was attacked, the other three attacked back at the same time!Chu Yang laughed as his arm suddenly sprung out. His hand, without an inch of steel, went straight for the shining blades.BAM\u2026 BAM\u2026 BAM\u2026 The three sounds rang out. All the witnesses could not believe what had just happened in front of their eyes.After Chu Yang\u2019s hand touched the guards\u2019 swords, their swords that had killed countless enemies immediately got chopped in two!When the guards saw Chu Yang was using his empty hand to fight with their swords, their eyes showed a trace of cruelty. They were sure that Chu Yang\u2019s hand would become minced meat. They never expected that upon contact, their swords were actually what got chopped up!No one there thought that such a thing would occur. At that moment, everyone could not help but freeze in shock. Chu Yang\u2019s hand stopped right at the throat of the guard from earlier. Very gently, Chu Yang lightly pinched the man\u2019s Adam apple.In a flash, Chu Yang was back in front of Tie Long Cheng.The four Revered Martial Artist masters looked at Chu Yang with terror in their eyes! A person\u2019s hand went against their extremely sharp swords, and scarily enough, their swords were chopped!Is he even human?Especially shocked was the guard who was pinched by Chu Yang; his body had become ice cold. If his opponent had used a little more force, his Adam\u2019s apple would have been crushed.Tie Long Cheng called Chu Yang a spy, and Chu Yang could not prove his innocence! With such a situation, the best and most effective explanation was force!\u201cThere is also another reason; it is so I could easily assassinate you! Is that enough reason? There is also\u2026\u201d Chu Yang smiled and picked up a fragment of one of the broken swords on the ground. He then used his own sword to shave it like a carrot, \u201cThis is divine weapon. Is this enough?\u201dAll of a sudden, everyone looked at Chu Yang with surprise in their eyes.\u201cAssassinate me, hahaha\u2026 that easily? To kill me, you alone are not enough. You certainly are confident in your abilities, but in this world, there are some things where just confidence is not enough. Of course, you not liking Diwu Qing Rou is reason enough for me.\u201d Tie Long Cheng used his hawk eyes to look at Chu Yang for a while and suddenly smiled, \u201cThe other two reasons are not important!\u201dAfter a pause, he continued, \u201cGood kid!\u201dWhen Chu Yang showed such monstrous force, he was surprised, but it did not scare him. Tie Long Cheng knew that if Chu Yang wanted to attack him, he would not have been so gentle.Chu Yang actions just now was done using borrowed power from Nine Tribulations Sword. By bringing Nine Tribulations Sword\u2019s tip to his hand, he could not fail! The moment his hand came into contact with the guards\u2019 swords, their essence was absorbed by Nine Tribulations Sword!So what Chu Yang touched was essentially tiny scraps of metal!Otherwise, Chu Yang would not have been able to cut these swords like they were mud even if he used swords forged from fine iron. The four guards\u2019 swords were definitely not ordinary items! They might not be divine weapons, but their quality exceeded that of ordinary swords by far.So, naturally, Tie Long Cheng\u2019s people were shocked!\u201cI want to know your true motive!\u201d Tie Long Cheng said with great gravity!\u201cTrue motive\u2026\u201d Chu Yang mulled over it for a while, \u201cDiwu Qing Rou and I really don\u2019t have any blood debts. But I just don\u2019t want him to win this war. And I definitely do not want him to achieve his goal of unifying all under the heavens.\u201dBecause of Tie Long Cheng\u2019s blockade, Chu Yang did not have a chance to meet with Tie Bu Tian. But Tie Long Cheng came here, himself. Even though he said he was blockading Chu Yang\u2019s house, he also gave Chu Yang an opportunity in coming here.Chu Yang already demonstrated his power; he also showed off his wealth. The only thing that was left now was to show off his wisdom. Because looking at Tie Long Cheng\u2019s reaction was, in a way, looking at Tie Bu Tian\u2019s reaction.\u201cI believe no one here wants Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s goals to be achieved!\u201d Tie Long Cheng smiled faintly. Chu Yang\u2019s demonstration of power seemed to have put Tie Long Cheng at ease somewhat.Chu Yang smiled and said, \u201cCurrently, all of Iron Cloud want to defeat Diwu Qing Rou, but based on all aspects, this is a delusion. You absolutely do not have the ability to succeed!\u201d\u201cBased on what?\u201d This time, the young lady spoke. Tie Long Cheng smiled coldly and remained quiet. He was just sharp and ferocious a moment ago, but now he seemed to keeping everything in check.\u201cFirst, Diwu Qing Rou is powerful with Great Zhao\u2019s military power of about six million soldiers! Famed generals ranking from second to seventh are all from Great Zhao. Each one an out of this world talent. On the other hand, Iron Cloud only has only two famed generals ranking first and tenth. We all know this ranking is not just for show. Each person in these positions has been through countless life and death situations! Each famed general has bathed his blade with the blood of no less than hundreds of thousands of lives!\u201dChu Yang quickly brought out his knowledge from his past life, \u201cSecond, even though Great Zhao has an emperor in name, the truth is all the power is in Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s hands! Moreover, Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s spy network surpasses that of Iron Cloud by far! Even though the Golden Horse Riders Department never showed itself, within it there is a large number of talents. What\u2019s more is there are elite fighters. Their number is about eight thousand!\u201dThis piece of information was like lightning to Tie Long Cheng and the young lady!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cGolden Horse Riders Department? You also know about Golden Horse Riders Department?\u201d Tie Long Cheng\u2019s thick eyebrows came together as he waved a signal with his hand. His countenance was extremely guarded.The soldiers outside immediately moved back by more than a hundred feet. The whole street was silent. Besides the body guards, there was not a shadow within the hundred feet radius. There was suddenly some swooshing sounds on the roof as countless masters quickly appeared, bringing the entire room under tight security.Heavenly Armament Pavilion was now under such tight security that even a mosquito would not be able to pass. It was enough to show the importance of such information to Tie Long Cheng.However, it was strange that the young lady, who clearly had no business with such important national matter, was not sent away by Tie Long Cheng. In fact, it seemed as if he approved of her presence.Chu Yang\u2019s eyes lit up as he thought to himself: It seems this young lady\u2019s position is not so simple. My previous guess that she was just someone of royal blood is not quite accurate. This young lady is either a princess or the king\u2019s favorite wife\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How do you know the number of people in Golden Horse Riders Department exceed this eight thousands?\u201d Tie Long Cheng cautiously asked, \u201cDo you know what this means? It means that in the entire continent, there is no military group capable of stopping a direct attack from the Golden Horse Riders Department. I can tell you that those who have not reached the level of Martial Master would not be chosen to enter Golden Horse Riders Department!\u201dTie Long Cheng was truly surprised. The existence of Golden Horse Riders Department was a big secret even within Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s internal circle. Iron Cloud had to pay a very expensive price along with countless people laying down their lives to discover this information on Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s secret army.Even though they knew this, all the information about Golden Horse Riders Department came in fragments, and could not be pieced together.Unexpectedly, this kid in front of Tie Long Cheng spoke about it as if this was some old news, not some big secret.\u201cThe eight thousand are just the number of Golden Horse Riders warriors. Within Golden Horse Riders Department, there are not just Golden Horse Riders warriors!\u201d Chu Yang spread his fingers and counted as if he was familiar with everything.\u201cGolden Horse Riders warriors are the fighting force of Golden Horse Riders Department, their secret fighting force. Only at key moments wheren the outcome of a battle is determined do they get deployed. But that\u2019s not all. Within Golden Horse Riders Department there exists Command Horse Riders who are in charge of the upper level decision making and planning. Black Horse Riders are killers, only one in ten thousands are chose; specific numbers are unknown. Besides them, there are also Silver Horse Riders who take care of the financials. Each country on the continent has about a thousand wealthy people; within this group, at least ten are Silver Horse Riders. Then there are Iron Horse Riders in charge of information gathering. Finally, there is Mysterious Horse Riders in charge of overseeing operations within Golden Horse Riders Department. The total strength of Golden Horse Riders Department is at least thirty thousand people.\u201dChu Yang laughed and continued, \u201cCurrently, Bu Tian Pavilion of Prince Tie Bu Tian has about the same man power as Golden Horse Riders Department, but, in term of organization and fighting power, it is about ten thousand miles behind Golden Horse Riders Department; a difference of heaven and earth!\u201dTie Long Cheng and the young lady looked at each other, internally dismayed.They knew that Diwu Qing Rou never used his full strength, but they never thought that Diwu Qing Rou still reserved such massive force as this.\u201cIn addition, in court, Diwu Qing Rou has the support of all officials. All those against him, either dead or banished, are out of Great Zhao\u2019s power center. All the proposals he puts out have no objections. This focus of power is his greatest strength.\u201dChu Yang slowly continued, \u201cAs far as I know, Diwu Qing Rou has a secret agreement with the Wolf Tribe of the Northern Grassland. I don\u2019t know the details of their agreement, but I know this has happened.\u201dChu Yang tossed out a piece of crucial news.This actually happened in the previous life. When Diwu Qing Rou started full out war with Iron Cloud, Lang Tinh unexpectedly attacked. At that time, the world knew about that agreement. Before that, even in Diwu Qing Rou power circle, very few knew about it.Tie Long Cheng eyes suddenly flashed, but his face never showed any reactions, as if he was wearing a mask.The Wolf Tribe \u2013 Northern Grassland was on Iron Cloud\u2019s back\u2026 Receiving a stab in the back after a peaceful co-existence\u2026 Everything was off.Iron Cloud Nation was planning to create a good relationship with the Wolf Tribe in the Northern Grassland in the shortest amount of time possible. But they had to deal with Diwu Qing Rou first. In this past half year, the first wave of ambassadors and gifts have successful arrived at the Wolf Tribe region. They were planning on sending another one soon\u2026If Prince Tie Bu Tian\u2019s sisters had not passed away, then they would have already been given up for political marriages already.With this news, though unverified, they felt as if their insides was being burned. If this was true, then all of Iron Cloud was being played by the Wolf Tribe.This betrayal was something Tie Long Cheng could not accept because this strategy was suggested by his military advisors. The military always resorted to war not peacemaking, but the pressure from Diwu Qing Rou was too great so they had to put out this peacemaking plan. If they went straight into a trap because of this\u2026 It would be a great shame.On the other hand, the young lady\u2019s countenance looked extremely casual, as if she did not truly understand this.\u201cA large portion of people in Jiang Hu are Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s people. Besides that, amongst the seven major sects of Lower Three Heavens, two are already completely under his control. Other sects all have his people on the inside.\u201dTie Long Cheng\u2019s countenance became more and more grave.\u201cDiwu Qing Rou also has four peak-level experts working for him. Two of them are in charge of protecting him. The other two are first and second leader of Golden Horse Riders Department. I heard that with their abilities they could easily advance into Middle Three Heavens. In fact, they are no less than the experts of Middle Three Heavens. They are all of King level; the strongest person is already a grade five Saber King!\u201dChu Yang just threw out another piece of earth-shattering news.Four King level experts!This news made Tie Long Cheng and the young lady stunned. Even Gu Du Xing standing next to him looked over in shock.\u201cNot possible! Shouldn\u2019t King level experts have already advanced into Middle Three Heavens? Upper Three Heavens even. They choose to live in such place like Lower Three Heavens?\u201d Gu Du Xing asked.\u201cNot just King level, but there are some of Emperors levels who would prefer human wealth and\u2026\u201d Chu Yang smiled, \u201cOtherwise, would such a dispute happen? Becoming strong to watch over the world is only the wish of some. Fame, wealth and women are the true pursuits of most people.\u201d\u201cYoung man, what you said makes sense!\u201dTie Long Cheng sighed and muttered, \u201cNo wonder my two Revered level martial brothers went to assassinate Diwu Qing Rou and never came back. So there are even King level experts next to Diwu Qing Rou\u2026\u201dHis voice was somber, full of bitterness.Diwu Qing Rou having high level guards was something Tie Long Cheng speculated after the failed assassination attempted. However, he could never have imagined that there were actually four King level experts.King level experts in Lower Three Heavens were like mountains you cannot pass. In principal, this was something that could not be.Tie Long Cheng\u2019s straight spear-like figure suddenly stooped a little. His countenance looked strange, as if remorseful, as if\u2026\u201cIn ten years, Diwu Qing Rou had built up his circle. Especially with the military, it is everywhere. General, you have fought with Great Zhao many times. You have seen it! These past ten years, all the generals loyal to Great Zhao\u2019s emperor are nowhere to be seen. Or, they fell to Iron Cloud\u2019s victories. Am I correct?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Tie Long Cheng sighed as the wrinkles on his face deepened further.\u201cAt the same time, the upcoming young ones were extremely difficult to deal with. Diwu Qing Rou used a tactic like this to eliminate any internal opposition. He cruelly prepared his plan for ten years later\u2026\u201dChu Yang was talking when he suddenly stopped.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe just realized the most incredible thing: Diwu Qing Rou planned for events that happened simultaneously in two countries! Without cooperation, he would not be able to achieve this, no matter how incredible he was. He especially did not have the ability to control enemy soldiers.This\u2026Tie Long Cheng sighed and answered weakly, \u201cYou are correct\u2026\u201dThis powerful general, each time he spoke, he seemed to have aged a little more.\u201cThere was definitely someone cooperating in all of this! The person who cooperated with him\u2026 is none other than me!\u201d Tie Long Cheng sighed and answered sadly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But as the pensiveness in her eyes increased, that sharpness also slowly disappeared.\u201cThree years ago, the emperor suddenly got hit by a poisoned arrow. His life was like a candle in the wind. At the time, the prince was only ten. And even though he was brilliant, it would have been difficult for people to accept his rule. Iron Cloud was at the verge of crumbling down. All the officials were thinking for themselves. It was a dangerous situation like a thousand pound weight hanging by a hair.\u201dTie Long Cheng said slowly. It made Chu Yang feel as if he was explaining himself! This was the first time they met. Even if he had the status, this man still shouldn\u2019t have to explain to him like this\u2026 this was really curious.Tie Long Cheng continued, \u201cAfter that, Diwu Qing Rou suddenly made some mistakes in the battlefield. Unexplainable situations that made seasoned generals of Great Zhao leave their bodies in the battlefield. These three battles were essentially inconsequential to Great Zhao, and certainly did not have to be so costly to them!\u201d\u201cBecause, at that time, they only had to simultaneously attack, and all of Iron Cloud would have gone up in a puff of smoke in about half a year! Our Iron Cloud was basically powerless at that point! However, at that key moment, the enemy\u2019s generals suddenly went to their deaths due to erroneous intelligence reports! As a result, we were able to easily wipe them out! Those decisive battles were the surviving chance that Iron Cloud needed!\u201d\u201cAfterwards, we sat down and went over everything. In looking at those three battles, we discovered that no matter how we tried, we never had the ability to push them into such trap! In another word, they were looking for their own deaths; they wanted death. This made us surprised and puzzled.\u201d\u201cAfter these incident, Great Zhao Nation\u2019s military took a month to rest and regroup. However, they did not need to rest or regroup at all; it seemed as if they were giving us time to regain our strength and strategize our plans on purpose\u2026\u201dTie Long Cheng took in a deep breath and said, \u201cIt was not until we brought back information from Great Zhao and carefully analyzed many times that we discovered it was Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s conspiracy! Unfortunately, we could do nothing but cooperate with this conspiracy! We could not avoid allowing him to lead us by the nose!\u201d\u201cDiwu Qing Rou needed a prolonged war to gather its exploits, eliminate his dissidents, increase his following, and bring the military under his control. And, at that period, our Iron Cloud needed time much more than Diwu Qing Rou did. Moreover, we needed to gather the country\u2019s military, because that period was key to the survival of Iron Cloud!\u201d\u201cIf we did not cooperate then Iron Cloud Nation would have fallen in only a few months. And even if we did not cooperate, Diwu Qing Rou still had other opportunities. Limitless Nation for example! We had a no choice. It was a humiliation, but we had to swallow our pride and live!\u201dWhen Tie Long Cheng got to this, he let out a very long sigh.Even though he did not continue, Chu Yang and the others understood.At that time, the two sides cooperated to eliminate dissidents and unify their respective nations! Without an actual agreement, you achieve your battle accomplishments, I take back my territories, you get rid of opposition, I eliminate my enemies, and everything quietly happened that way!\u201dIn short, their goals were the same: Unify all of their respective nation\u2019s power to realize their own strength!If Diwu Qing Rou went to war at that time, Great Zhao would, without a doubt, have had complete victory. However, after that victory, he would have to face the doubt and opposition among some officials as well as soldiers. At that time, his foundation was not yet stable. In the worst case scenario, he could end up without a place to bury his dead body! Even if he could keep his life and his position at the time, he would have absolutely lost any opportunity to advance to the peak of power!With Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s ambition and the wonderful opportunity in front of him, how could he have let it pass?Of course he could not.At the time, the entire Iron Cloud Nation was held by Tie Long Cheng. In such a precarious situation, the nation seemed as if it could fall apart by itself. Tie Long Cheng, naturally, did not want to battle either!The commanders of two countries never met each other even once. And even though they were separated by tens of thousands of miles their tacit cooperation was terrifyingly perfect! The two sides controlled each other, restrained each other. Today, you beat me and kill a general opposing me. Tomorrow, I beat you and kill your opposition\u2026Millions of soldiers killing each other at the border of the two countries was no more than a game between two people! Millions of souls to create worldly fame for Diwu Qing Rou. On the other hand, those millions of souls also helped unify Iron Cloud!The only thing was\u2026 This game was for the two sides to buy some time and to gain status, but, for both sides, the underlying motives were completely different.Diwu Qing Rou was working for Great Zhao, but, even more so, he was working for himself. As for Tie Long Cheng, after a long period of battle, he had managed to successfully unify a fragmented Iron Cloud. That separated nation had now turned into a powerful force!Without such precise cooperation between Tie Long Cheng and Diwu Qing Rou, Iron Cloud Nation would absolutely not be able to hang on until now. Not to mention prince Tie Bu Tian ever having the chance to take control and standing at the same level as Diwu Qing Rou!All the changes in this was unimaginable even if one racked their brain. Moreover, with each move, the commander had to put out some underlying intentions that only his counterpart could understand. That was how they each achieved their goals. Such underlying intentions were definitely not recognized by outsiders!As an outsider, how much thought would you need to put into this? This was really unthinkable! Chu Yang really had no way of imagining how this general Tie Long Cheng got this current result.Under Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s direction, he cooperated fully, but did not allowed his opposition achieve his full goal. Moreover, under the sky net that the enemy threw out, he still managed to step-by-step build up resistant strength for Iron Cloud. Up to this point, the border between the two countries had become like a fortified wall!This person\u2019s ability to calculate, govern and control in both political and military front, while not equal to that of Diwu Qing Rou, it was not that far behind!Two enemies that could never be under one sky fought with each other while helping each other amass power. These two were truly terrifying!But there was one thing that was really chilling to Chu Yang: In Tie Long Cheng and Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s fighting, they had looked at millions of soldiers on both sides as no more than something that could be thrown away. These were millions of lives!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euChu Yang had never understood the phrase \u201cA general build his success on ten thousands dry bones\u201d as he did now!\u201cYou\u2019re regretting it?\u201dThe person that said this was Gu Du Xing. His gaze was like two icy swords aiming at Tie Long Cheng, \u201cMillions of soldiers left their bodies in the battlefield because of the cooperation between the two of you!\u201d\u201cNot millions, the actual number is two millions seven hundred ninety-three thousand seven hundred ninety-six people!\u201dTie Long Cheng\u2019s face was like that of a statue, emotionless, \u201cThis is the number up to now. This is only the number of the ones that laid down their lives. This number does not include the injured, the handicapped, unable to battle any longer, the missing\u2026! This was the great price paid for Iron Cloud\u2019s current state!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I, Tie Long Cheng, never regret. Death in the battlefield is the destiny of soldiers!\u201d Tie Long Cheng\u2019s eyes never moved, as if he was staring into nothingness, \u201cI am saddened and sorry for those fates, but I definitely do not regret!\u201d\u201cSorry and saddened?\u201d Gu Du Xing smiled coldly, \u201cWhen you sent those soldiers and placed them into their place of death, were you saddened and sorry? I know that their commanding officers were in the wrong and were not loyal to you, but the soldiers were blameless! Couldn\u2019t you have chosen another method to preserve the lives of the soldiers?\u201dGu Du Xing really was not able to imagine that there could be such a thing in this world! The better the person, the more loyal the person, the more likely they were to become sacrificed, the more easily they were to be tossed aside!What sort of sh*tty principle is this?Such ridiculous moves were actually made by the leaders of two superpowers! Two representative for two large nations who should take care of their own people turned out to be two cruel executioners. They single-handedly sent millions of young men to their deaths!\u201cIf I did not do that, how could I have won Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s trust? With all the dead soldiers, I am saddened but I have no regrets!\u201d Tie Long Cheng coldly said, \u201cThey died, but the lives of six hundred million people of Iron Cloud are protected! Without their deaths, Iron Cloud would have already become a territory of Great Zhao eight years ago! At that time, all of the men and women of Iron Cloud Nation would have become slaves for people to abuse, for people to bully!\u201d\u201cI, Tie Long Cheng, did a despicable thing, but I do not regret it! Even if history books will someday write out the truth about these past eight years. Even if I, Tie Long Cheng, am to become an eternal sinner, I have no regrets! If these things were repeated, I would also choose the same path.\u201d\u201cIf I, Tie Long Cheng, had surrendered and let Great Zhao attack, my own losses would not be that great. In Iron Cloud, I am a prince and also a grand marshal. If Great Zhao takes over, I would at least be a royal or a royal court official. I will never be a person for people to step on, even Diwu Qing Rou would not dare!\u201d\u201cSo what if I am scorned?\u201d Tie Long Cheng smiled, \u201cEven infamy has to be bore by someone. To protect Iron Cloud is reason enough to take on this infamy.\u201d\u201cBut infamy is not easy to bear.\u201d Chu Yang snorted and said, \u201cYou two cooperated closely like this, used each other to this level, you did not forget to place spies within enemy\u2019s ranks, right?\u201dTie Long Cheng\u2019s body suddenly became stiff. His eyes shot out two sharp bolts of lightning in Chu Yang\u2019s direction and remained quiet after that.\u201cEight years! Eight years of fighting have caused both sides to suffer great damages. Naturally, there would be a high turnover. And these spies could use each victory to advance in position! Those times are the best for placing spies! I don\u2019t believe Grand Marshal Tie did not do that!\u201dTie Long Cheng countenance became cold as he stood still.\u201cI am also sure that Diwu Qing Rou already have people well-placed in Iron Cloud. Moreover, even though you are capable of strategizing, understanding tactics, recognizing battle plans, fighting for your country\u2019s interest, looking at the big picture\u2026 But you are not like Diwu Qing Rou. You are not a master conspirator and politician like him. Therefore, I especially believe in this\u2026\u201dChu Yang smiled. His words made Tie Long Cheng\u2019s whole body turn cold.\u201c\u2026 If you were able to place ten spies in Great Zhao, Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s spies in Iron Cloud would be no less than a hundred! A difference of ten times!\u201dHe paused and said, \u201cI am referring to the army, Grand Marshal!\u201dTie Long Cheng quietly let out a sigh.\u201cTherefore, at first glance it might seem like Iron Cloud is currently stable and fortified. But if Diwu Qing Rou really starts war, then Iron Cloud will be no different from eight years ago, unable to take a beating!\u201d As Chu Yang went on, he became more critical, \u201cYou don\u2019t really believe Diwu Qing Rou would allow you to turn Iron Cloud into an unbreakable block of iron, do you? If you truly believe this, you are not worthy of this number one general position!\u201dTie Long Cheng let out a strange laugh and said with heartfelt praise, \u201cThat\u2019s right! Very well said!\u201dHe then suddenly became pensive and asked, \u201cThese things you just said, do you have a secret spy network or did you see through everything on your own? Did you really figure this out?\u201dAs these words came out of Tie Long Cheng\u2019s mouth, the eyes of the young lady, who have been standing quietly on the side, suddenly brightened. Her body turned in Chu Yang\u2019s direction as her gaze seemed to show a sense of great urgency.Tie Long Cheng\u2019s tone was very cautious as he asked this question.It was because this question was of great importance. If Chu Yang had such a network of spies that was capable of getting information that he could not, then it would certainly be a big help! With this powerful spying force alone, Chu Yang would be qualified to work with Iron Cloud!Work with, not work for!However, if Chu Yang did not have any spy network and he was able to extrapolate these things from a few little clues, then it was even more terrifying! This proved that this youth in front of them had intelligence that was absolutely not inferior to Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s!Even a fraction more!This is an exceptional talent! One person who can bring glory to the state; one person who can determine the fate of the nation! This saying was meant for such a person!Chu Yang was silent for a moment, then he said, \u201cI don\u2019t have such a powerful intelligence gathering force.\u201dTie Long Cheng and the young lady simultaneously changed color with shock. Since the beginning they were acting casual. Even when Chu Yang told them about the plots and massive strength of Diwu Qing Rou, their gazes only flashed a little emotion. But after hearing these words, their countenance immediately changed.All of these things came from this young man\u2019s wisdom?\u201cI did not figure these things out.\u201d Chu Yang added. He knew Tie Long Cheng\u2019s thoughts when he asked such a question. He also knew that there were great advantages to simply letting the man misunderstand.However, Chu Yang had to let this chance go.Because if the other person truly misunderstood, after they cooperate, Chu Yang would surely be asked for input on many issues. Even though he would have many privileges beyond his desire at that time, one erroneous judgment would directly cause millions of soldiers\u2019 lives!Such a thing would have a direct effect on the war between the two nations! Once a mistake is made, even he could not have any means to turn the situation around! And everything would happen as it did in the previous life, unchangeable!If Chu Yang really had such deductive skills, he would, naturally, not avoid this. However, he was just using the memories of his previous life; he never had such fine observation skills. This, he knew.This was the reason he let the opportunity go, but he also did not explain clearly and only gave Tie Long Cheng vague hints to let him think: This person is surely an exceptional talent! (TLN: Make them think I am a talent, but don\u2019t admit it.)Tie Long Cheng thought for a little. When he looked up and still didn\u2019t hear Chu Yang say anything else, he immediately knew that since they were not cooperating, Chu Yang obviously wanted to keep secrets to himself and would not give comprehensive details. So now was the time to negotiate.But Tie Long Cheng did not because he had other plans.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe turned and looked at Chu Yang, \u201cYou have said this much. What do you want? Everything you said were undisclosed secrets of Diwu Qing Rou. Regardless of how you knew all this, based on that alone, you are of great value. You don\u2019t like Diwu Qing Rou. I believe you. So you came to Iron Cloud with what motive?\u201d\u201cWhat I want is, in fact, very clear.\u201d Chu Yang smiled, \u201cYou cannot see it?\u201dTie Long Cheng also smiled, \u201cYes, whatever you want to do is no business of mine. The person you want to find is Prince Tie Bu Tian, not me.\u201dThe moment he said the words \u201cTie Bu Tian\u201d, Tie Long Cheng did not even blink and only looked straight ahead at Chu Yang. But there was something unusual in his voice.\u201cI did not want to find you, but you brought yourself here.\u201d Chu Yang snorted and said angrily, \u201cAnd you blockaded my Heavenly Armament Pavilion!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You\u2019re even saying I shouldn\u2019t look for you?\u201d Chu Yang sighed, \u201cYou\u2019re so old you\u2019re talking rubbish now?\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201dHearing what Chu Yang said, Tie Long Cheng\u2019s guards glared, but Tie Long Cheng, himself, just laughed freely and walked out.Upon reaching the door, he turned his head and looked at Chu Yang, \u201cI like these swords of yours, but one hundred thousand gold taels is too expensive. Rare items, I also have a lot of. But these, I want to save for the soldiers; they are not for exchange. Well, how will I get these swords of yours?\u201dChu Yang was beginning to feel dizzy; he had never seen anyone so thick-skinned as this. His talking like that, was it any different from asking me to give him one?He snapped, \u201cI don\u2019t really want to part with these swords, and certainly will not give them to just anyone. The one person I will not give them to\u2026 is you!\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Tie Long Cheng was especially cheerful. He laughed until tears came out.\u201cBoy, in the end, you will have to give them to me. I guarantee this! At that time, I will not accept, leaving you to beg for a while before accepting reluctantly; just you wait and see.\u201dWhen he was done speaking, he once again laughed heartily. After leaving such a cryptic message like this, he immediately went out the door and left.\u201cWant me to beg you? You can keep waiting!\u201d Chu Yang snorted, \u201cIt\u2019s not even dark and you\u2019re already having such a nice dream!\u201dSwooshing sounds were heard outside in a very orderly fashion. Within moments, the whole street was without any soldiers. The soldiers withdrew quickly but did not create any sort of commotion, not even a tiny one.In the distance, bustling sounds started to ring out. At this time, the street started to recover its liveliness.Chu Yang turned around and was about to say something when his mouth suddenly opened wide.In front of him now was only Gu Du Xing. That strange young lady had disappeared. It seemed she had come to talk prices for fun. After not doing anything else, she left without a trace\u2026\u201cWhere did she go?\u201d Chu Yang scratched his head.\u201cWho cares if she left or not. I have a question for you\u2026\u201d Gu Du Xing looked at him seriously, \u201cYou want to intervene in the war between Iron Cloud Nation and Great Zhao Nation, don\u2019t you?\u201dChu Yang nodded and replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThis is a very stupid decision! You and I are just martial artists. I believe you know what being a martial artist means. The position of martial artists in this Lower Three Heavens, the attitude of the royal court toward martial artists, these are not things you don\u2019t know. What\u2019s more, whether it is the royal court or the battlefield, they are both much more dangerous than Jiang Hu. I don\u2019t think this is a good decision on your part.\u201d\u201cI know this is not the path for martial artists. I also know about the danger. I am also sure that once I put myself on this path I could die at any time without a place to bury my body. Even so, I still must take it.\u201d Chu Yang looked at Gu Du Xing and said, \u201cJust as you would rather die ten thousand times than not save Gu Miao Ling, I also have similar reasons.\u201dGu Du Xing looked straight into Chu Yang\u2019s eyes and saw, in the depth of his eyes, pain mixed with longing. This type of deep emotion was even more profound compared to his love for Gu Miao Ling!Gu Du Xing slowly nodded. At this moment, he suddenly understood why Chu Yang wanted to help him save Gu Miao Ling. Even though Chu Yang did not say, Gu Du Xing already understood his thoughts.Chu Yang, too, had a love like that! Therefore, he would not allow any female to suffer an unfortunate fate. He also would not allow a beautiful and sincere love to turn to dust and be buried with time.It was also at this moment that a warm feeling rose inside of Gu Du Xing.\u201cIf you think this is dangerous then you can still leave now.\u201d Chu Yang said casually, \u201cMy promise to help you, I will still keep.\u201d\u201cI want to leave\u2026 but I understand\u2026, the place that can help me cultivate the quickest is the battlefield.\u201d Gu Du Xing smiled. His smile was as bright and warm as the sun, \u201cAfter all, I already agreed to sell myself to you for ten years. I might want to back out, but honoring my commitment is more important.\u201dHe winked a few times and continued, \u201cYou only cared about keeping your own promises. You want me not to keep mine and become a bad person?\u201dChu Yang quietly looked at him for a long time before he finally relaxed and smiled, \u201cYeah, I thought you wanted to take back your words. I didn\u2019t expect this.\u201dGu Du Xing laughed out loud and punched Chu Yang on the shoulder hard. The two looked at each other and suddenly laughed. In this moment, a brotherly love, the kind that can weather through storms and hardship, sprouted inside both of them.You can put out all your efforts for my sake; I can put my life on the line for your sake. It was that simple!The two young men had officially accepted each other, but neither said a word. On the contrary, they used their previous agreement as an excuse to cover their sincerity.However, both sides knew that the other person understood their true feelings.The happiness at this moment was truly warm.********************Not too far off from there, within the military\u2019s circle of protection, Tie Long Cheng and that strange young lady were talking quietly with each other.Tie Long Cheng: \u201cThis person is useful. We can use him to do great things.\u201dYoung lady: \u201cHuh? Really?\u201d\u201cStop pretending in front of me. Why did you come here? And by yourself, too?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cEven though I don\u2019t know why he wants to go head to head with Diwu Qing Rou, when he opened Heavenly Armament Pavilion, the words Heavenly Armament were enough for me to understand his intentions.\u201d Tie Long Cheng smiled, \u201cSurely no one would be stupid enough to open a Heavenly Armament Pavilion in Iron Cloud because these two words \u2018Heavenly Armament\u2019 are a taboo here. And yet he did this on purpose. Because of this, I thought he did not know what happened before.\u201dThe young lady nodded, then suddenly turned and asked, \u201cThis is why Second Uncle\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHmmm, I came here because of this. Also because when you met him at the citadel gate, you showed interest in him, a little too much interest. Looking for talents like a drought looks for rain is a good thing of course. But you are still young. Your second uncle might be old, but I will help you look at people.\u201d Tie Long Cheng smiled, \u201cI just didn\u2019t think you would be so quick.\u201d\u201cSo everything Second Uncle said to him was all intentional?\u201d The young lady thought for a little and smiled again, \u201cEach sentence carried some meaning? Second Uncle is truly shrewd.\u201d\u201cHaha, he wants to deal with Diwu Qing Rou and you were also there, so of course, I told him the great price we had to pay for going head to head with Diwu Qing Rou. This was something that was necessary to be done, but those secrets that he spoke of, I don\u2019t even know some of them.\u201d\u201cBut this opened up Second Uncle\u2019s old wounds\u2026\u201d The young lady took a deep breath and said with great gravity, \u201cI know that in this entire Iron Cloud Nation, the one person that really doesn\u2019t want to talk about that year was you, Second Uncle. But today, you brought it up first. Second Uncle did that for me\u2026\u201d\u201cAlso for Iron Cloud.\u201d Tie Long Cheng face became somber, resilience clearly shown on his face, \u201cNot talking about it does not mean it did not happen. If there comes a day when Second Uncle can no longer go into the battlefield, I hope that you people won\u2019t make the wrong judgements because history had concealed the truth. That is why I must talk about it! Even if the wound has already scarred over, it must be uncovered.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It is certain that he wants to go against Diwu Qing Rou; there is no doubt about that. However, his reasons are unclear. The strangest thing is that I did not see a thirst for power in his eyes. This truly surprised me.\u201d Tie Long Cheng mused.\u201cHas that day finally come\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying\u2026 the trials? Well, that\u2019s a possibility.

See if there has been sudden appearances of powerful youngsters.\u201d Tie Long Cheng said plainly, \u201cIf there are, especially if there are more than one, then our guess is correct.\u201d\u201cUm, but we still have to keep some distance from that person.\u201d\u201cOf course. He could be used, but not controlled!\u201d\u201cThis Chu Yang was really expelled from Beyond the Heavens Sect.\u201d The young lady mused for a while before slowly saying these words.\u201cExpelled by Beyond the Heavens Sect? How could that be? How could Wu Yun Liang be willing to toss out such a talent?\u201d\u201cI also felt that was strange. Moreover, I felt the person next to him really came from that place.\u201d\u201cThe person next to him?\u201d\u201cThe young man next to him was also very scary. Moreover, his origin is even more mysterious compared to Chu Yang\u2019s. He seemed to have appeared out of thin air.\u201d\u201cRegardless, as long as he listens to Chu Yang, it\u2019s fine. Therefore, we only need to worry about watching Chu Yang\u2019s actions. Ah, in addition, find a way for Wu Yun Liang of Beyond the Heavens Sect and I to meet. I want to ask him a few questions.\u201d\u201cSure!\u201d\u201cLet the court officials know that the case of the massive robberies no longer needs to be investigated.\u201d Tie Long Cheng laughed, \u201cIf they keep investigating, and accidentally find out the truth, wouldn\u2019t you have to waste your energy to wipe his butt?\u201d\u201cSo Second Uncle also thought about this.\u201d The red faced young lady said. Of course her skin was still a little thin for these \u201cbutt wiping\u201d words from her second uncle.\u201cIt\u2019s more like everyone wants to wipe his butt!\u201d Tie Long Cheng laughed.This made the young lady a little pensive. Then suddenly her eyes lit up. These were crude words; but did they hold some profound meaning?At a fork on the road, the young lady and Tie Long Cheng parted ways. The young lady waved and gently fluttered off. After a few turns, she disappeared.Tie Long Cheng\u2019s eyes followed as the young lady slowly went away. In his eyes, there suddenly appeared a trace of pity. He sighed and muttered, \u201cIron Cloud has become a burden, difficult to hold up\u2026\u201d\u201cNo matter how heavy the burden is, as long as Grand Marshal is here, Iron Cloud will remain!\u201d His second in command standing next to him said respectfully, as if he completely had faith in Tie Long Cheng.\u201cI am only Grand Marshal, not\u2026\u201d Tie Long Cheng shook his head. And without finishing that sentence he yelled, \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201dWith that, he headed forward, leading the group. Not too far in the distance was Heaven\u2019s Prestige Manor, Tie Long Cheng\u2019s residence.In Iron Cloud Nation, Tie Long Cheng was given the title Heaven\u2019s Prestige Royal Highness!\u201cI am already old. It\u2019s time step aside and let enthusiastic young people take over.\u201d Tie Long Cheng thought and ordered, \u201cIn the future, all military matters, big or small, should be reported to the prince at the same time you report to me! If it\u2019s not a big battle, you don\u2019t need to ask for my opinion.

Even though many people came and looked, but not one dared to enter.However, the two people in the shop were not worried at all. Around noon, Gu Du Xing grabbed a lot of money and lavishly bought food and wine. With the entire table filled, the two took their time eating and drinking.After filling up a cup, Gu Du Xing brought it up and said, \u201cChu Yang, this one is to you!\u201d\u201cGood, cheers!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026, strangely, I don\u2019t want to drink this cup of wine.\u201d\u201cOh?

But\u2026 you fly me or I fly you?\u201d (TLN: shuang fei also means \u2018union between husband and wife\u2019)\u201cGet out of here! You can fly with a pair of pigs!\u201d (TLN: erm\u2026 shuang fei is also used nowadays as a slang for a threesome)\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d (walkthejianghu.com)After three rounds, there were two empty wine jars on the ground. The two jars on the table were half empty. Each of these was a five pound wine jar. Moreover, this was the strongest type of wine.Gu Du Xing was getting a little tipsy, and said loudly, \u201cChu Yang, I just realized how great you are! But I still can\u2019t figure out what family kicked you out. There is no reason anymore. In this world, how could there be a young person worthy of my respect? This is wrong\u2026\u201d\u201cI have no family.\u201d Chu Yang paused for a moment and hastily emptied a cup of wine.\u201cNo family?\u201d\u201cI am an orphan. More specifically, I was abandoned.\u201d Chu Yang laughed and tears came out of his eyes, \u201cI don\u2019t even know my own name. My current name was given by my teacher.\u201dSilence filled the air.\u201cThat\u2019s still good. At least you still have hope of meeting your parents again. You just don\u2019t know where they are.\u201d Gu Du Xing sighed, \u201cI have parents, and I know who they are. But my parents were both killed. I will never be able to see them again\u2026\u201d\u201cMeh\u2026! Let\u2019s not talk about that anymore! Drink, drink\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, drink! Let\u2019s not talk about that anymore.\u201d\u2026\u201cChu Yang, before I met you, I did not have a brother\u2026, hahaha\u2026, but now I have one\u2026 hehe\u2026\u201d\u201cReally? Where is he? Why haven\u2019t I met him yet?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter that you haven\u2019t met him. It\u2019s enough that I met him, hahaha\u2026\u201d\u201cBrother\u2026 A brother is what?\u201d\u201cBrother\u2026, hahaha\u2026 A brother is a brother, not a what!\u201d Gu Du Xing laughed loudly, \u201cIf there is a mountain of knives in front of my brother, I would be ready to go over that mountain for him! This is a brother! Even if my brother does not see me as a brother, I only need to see him as a brother to make it so!\u201dGu Du Xing was finally drunk. He stood up unsteadily and suddenly beat his chest as he looked up to the heavens and yelled, \u201cIn two decades, I have never been this happy! Hahaha\u2026 Happy\u2026!\u201dHe suddenly fell down on the table and started snoring\u2026Chu Yang\u2019s vision was getting a little hazy, but his hand still brought the wine cup to his mouth. After swallowing the wine, he suddenly became still. He muttered, \u201cIf there is a mountain of knives in front of my brother, I would be ready to go over that mountain for him! This is a brother! Even if my brother does not see me as a brother, I only need to see him as a brother to make it so!\u201dHe nodded his head a few times. Then he shook his head and smiled as he muttered, \u201cIf you treat your brother that way, then your brother would naturally treat you that way. Being brothers is about taking care of each other. It takes two not one.\u201dHis eyes stared blankly into space as he whispered, \u201cIf you are my brother then you will definitely not be alone!\u201dEven though the volume was low, these words were full of bravado. He suddenly reminisced about Tan Tan, the person who found the only precious treasure in his whole lifetime and wanted to give it to his martial brother!That is also a brother!He lifted the wine jar and chugged\u2026Wine spilled everywhere!**********************The consequence of this drinking was the closing of Heavenly Armament Pavilion. Two drunken men snored as they lay on the table\u2026 Outside the door, people were coming and going. But inside, sounds of snoring rang out. The smell of wine and meat spread everywhere\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThese two people had a rare indulgence. They both knew that such careless indulgence would be hard to come by later.It was not until the afternoon that the two came to. Their wine soaked clothes were dried. They looked at each other and suddenly laughed.In this moment, there was a knock on the door, \u201cExcuse me. Is this Chu Yang\u2019s place?\u201dThe voice belonged to a young lady.Chu Yang was startled. He was very familiar with this voice. It was Wu Qian Qian\u2019s voice!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even in her dreams, she would never imagine Chu Yang would suddenly appear at Iron Cloud Citadel. Moreover, he even had Prince Bu Tian\u2019s attention.When Tie Bu Tian asked her, Wu Qian Qian could not believe that the prince\u2019s Chu Yang was the same Chu Yang she met at Purple Bamboo Garden. Wu Qian Qian assumed it was someone similar, or just someone with the same name.Surely, somewhere out there, there is a heroic youth also named Chu Yang.Even though Chu Yang of Purple Bamboo Garden was quick-witted, his cultivation was too low. He was not worthy of the prince\u2019s attention.However, now that this familiar face appeared in front of her, there were no longer any doubt.\u201cElder Martial Sister Wu, why have you come here?\u201d Chu Yang asked, a little surprised.\u201cWhat? I can\u2019t come?\u201d As Wu Qian Qian spoke, her face slightly reddened. She remembered the words Du Shi Qing said to the prince:\u201cThis youth\u2019s life is really pitiful. He loves his martial sister, but his elder martial brother wanted to take his love with force. In an emotional moment, he accidentally killed his elder martial brother\u2026 What a waste of a talent\u2026 Oh, his martial sister seemed to be the daughter of the leader of Beyond the Heavens Sect\u2026\u201dWu Qian Qian\u2019s face felt as if it was burning when her thoughts reached this point. Daughter of the leader of Beyond the Heavens Sect? My father only has me for a daughter; can it be that Chu Yang likes me?But\u2026 This is all too sudden\u2026\u201cAh, you can come. You can come. Of course, you can come.\u201d Chu Yang scratched his head and took a step back, \u201cElder Martial Sister, please come in.\u201d\u201cYou are no longer a disciple of Beyond the Heavens Sect. My father has sent out notice that you are expelled from the sect to everyone. Therefore, you should not call me elder martial sister anymore; I cannot afford such a title.\u201dWu Qian Qian felt a little pity. Why was Chu Yang expelled from the sect for such a wretched reason?On the other hand, Wu Qian Qian used these words to create distance between them, to avoid Chu Yang using their old connection to cling onto her. This was Iron Cloud Citadel; if something were to happen, Chu Yang would be fine, but she would cause damage to Beyond the Heavens Sect\u2019s name.\u201cAh, I should call you little sister\u2026\u201d Chu Yang tapped his head a few times, \u201cBut you seem to be older than me, should I call you Elder Sister Qian Qian?\u201dWu Qian Qian\u2019s face turned pink. She scolded, \u201cStop being a smarty pants! Follow me quickly.\u201d\u201cFollow older sister?\u201d\u201cThe prince has sent me to invite you. I really can\u2019t see what\u2019s so great about you that the prince specified your name and wanted to see you.\u201d Wu Qian Qian glared at him.\u201cIf it was just him specifying my name wanting to meet me, I would not go!\u201d Chu Yang laughed, \u201cBut since older sister came to especially invite me, I\u2019ll go.\u201d\u201cMeet\u201d and \u201cinvite\u201d were two quite different things, Tie Bu Tian\u2019s words reflected his attitude (TLN: Tie Bu Tian used a polite \u2018invitation\u2019 instead of commanding Chu Yang to met him). Chu Yang was successful in setting up his base of power, as well as layers upon layers of tactics to show off to Tie Bu Tian. First, there was his sharp gaze and agile movements. Upon that, there were Du Shi Qing\u2019s endless praises and the irresistible Heavenly Armament Pavilion. And now, there was the addition of Tie Long Cheng\u2019s referral.Upon reflecting over everything, Tie Long Cheng would, of course, tell Tie Bu Tian about all of it. Chu Yang had no doubt about this. Tie Long Cheng\u2019s description of Chu Yang would affirm another thing: Chu Yang\u2019s conjectures and intelligence were unparalleled! That his judgements in worldly events were accurate and his understanding of Diwu Qing Rou was profound.Everything was related to the survival of Iron Cloud Nation and the outcome of the war between Tie Bu Tian and Diwu Qing Rou. If Tie Bu Tian did not ask to meet him, that would be the strange thing.After Chu Yang left Beyond the Heavens Sect, he joined Du Shi Qing\u2019s group. All his planning and arranging was for this day!And this day was finally here!In this key moment, Chu Yang naturally would not pass up the chance raise his status.\u201cIt was the prince who sent me to invite you, okay?\u201d Wu Qian Qian continued angrily, \u201cThe prince knows that I know you; that\u2019s why he especially sent me here. He also sent ninety-nine of his body guards. The carriage in front is the one used by the prince. He even sent sixteen armored riders as an extra precaution. These are all formalities reserved for national guests! These past few years, no one had received such a welcome in Iron Cloud Nation!\u201cOh?\u201d Chu Yang could not help being startled. Even though he was sure that Tie Bu Tian would send people to invite him, such ceremonious welcoming like this was entirely unexpected.*********************Big Boss Chu swayed back and forth as he sat in an extremely extravagant carriage. In the front, there were eight golden-armored riders valiantly leading the way. Each one fearless as they sat on horses white as snow and without a strand of hair out of place. (TLN: The horses\u2019 hair, but I\u2019m sure the riders\u2019 hair were neat, too.)As for the rest, there were two golden-armored riders on either side of the carriage and four golden-armored riders behind the carriage. In addition, there were ninety-nine silver-armored soldiers. Their stature was as straight as statues. Their formation was so orderly that at any angle, one could see a straight marching line with each movement smooth and in perfect unity.The soldiers neatly marched. Their figures were like statues, their gazes were unwavering, and their lines were glorious. Everything worked together to form a scene so magnificent it made people\u2019s hearts trembled.Chu Yang slightly squinted his eyes, trying to give a calm appearance, as if he was not paying attention to the whole scene in front of his eyes. He sat straight in a stately manner. However, in his mind, he was screaming: Great ancestors, this is so grand. Once everything is over, I am going to create a team like this. No matter where I go, I want them to put on the same ceremony. This is truly a distinctive style\u2026Even though he felt powerful, Chu Yan still let the curtains in the carriage down. If Chu Yang showed his face to the outside now, Diwu Qing Rou would probably know that the person invited by Tie Bu Tian was him\u2026 Hehe, it would not be a good thing!Safety above all else\u2026\u201cThank you, Senior Chu for coming. I am really grateful. Please sit.\u201d Tie Bu Tian was refined, draped in an outfit white as snow. He smiled and greeted Chu Yang warmly.Chu Yang was a little surprised when he realized that the place Tie Bu Tian met him was Bu Tian Pavilion. On the way there, he did not see another shadow. As if this meeting was extremely secret. (TLN: It really doesn\u2019t make sense to me either. I am sure everyone noticed the shiny marching band.)Their meeting place was a small lake behind Bu Tian Pavilion. In the middle of the lake, there was a small island with a little gazebo.The guards brought Chu Yang to the gazebo and immediately withdrew.Chu Yang watched Tie Bu Tian, who had a calm and quiet air. He was even a little aloof.The courtesy that Tie Bu Tian showed Chu Yang had made him feel warm for a moment. But now it had completely disappeared.If it was some green boy of the same age, he would have surely cried tears of gratitude and be loyal to the prince for the rest of his life. But Chu Yang was a monster that lived two lifetimes, so he kept calm. Being able to impress him for just a little bit; Tie Bu Tian was pretty good already.\u201cYour Highness, what orders do you have for me?\u201d Chu Yang asked leisurely.\u201cI dare not say orders. Senior Chu is talented. I am sure you know why I want to meet with you today.\u201d Tie Bu Tian smiled gently.\u201cThis peasant is ignorant. I still don\u2019t understand the prince\u2019s intentions.\u201dTie Bu Tian sighed and stood up. He clasped his hands behind his back and turned to look at the calm lake surface. He lightly opened his mouth and said, \u201cSenior Chu came from a sect in Jiang Hu. Surely you understand the current views of the world. The royal courts and Jiang Hu might be clearly divided, but, in principle, the two have the same root and are not separated from each other.\u201d\u201cIf the royal court is a circle of prevailing power that envelopes everything, then Jiang Hu is a different circle of power, just slightly weaker!\u201d Tie Bu Tian quietly said, \u201cIn other word, Jiang Hu is a secondary force, capable of assisting the royal court\u2019s power at key periods. For example, when the people fall into hard times, a hero would rise up and rally the people. Thus, creating a new center of power.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cNew countries are started by Jiang Hu! Or they might be depending on some power from the royal court, but the dominant force is still from Jiang Hu! After some changes, these people would accumulate their own power, their own territory and their own laws. The final result of such success is them becoming the leader of the royal court!\u201dChu Yang thought carefully and finally nodded, \u201cWhat Your Highness said is true.\u201dHe thought about how things changed over the past few thousand years. After unexpected changes, numerous countries fell and many new ones rose by that path.Those new countries were indeed started by people of Jiang Hu. Even though a great majority failed and were destroyed, many also succeeded.Saying that the royal court was an evolved form of Jiang Hu was not necessarily wrong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 82 \u2013 A head to head with the prince\u201cMy ancestors were a big family in Jiang Hu. They were called East Mountain\u2019s Tie Family. Before we entered the royal court, we did rule over a whole region.\u201d Without turning back, Tie Bu Tian continued to speak slowly, \u201cBut once a force from Jiang Hu becomes involved with the political arena of the royal court, it has to follow the rules of the royal court. The management methods of Jiang Hu might be fine for ruling over a family or even a people in one region, but they cannot be used to rule a nation. This is Jiang Hu\u2019s limitation.\u201d\u201cThere comes a time when you have to decide to get rid of something in exchange for something new. That something you have to get rid of is usually\u2026 good people! In Jiang Hu, all are brothers. In the royal court, it\u2019s emperor and subject. If the subject still sees the emperor as a brother, then the situation of brothers killing each other would be bound to happen!\u201d (TLN: Killing for power because of a lack of clear divide.)In history, it has always been so. If there are no more rabbits then the dog goes in the pot; if there are no more birds then you break the bow. If there are no more shields and swords, then get rid of the cavalry. If the emperor and subject relation thrives, then get rid of the brotherly relation!\u201d (TLN: Get rid of the unnecessary stuff?)\u201cSuch a method may be ruthless, but they are necessary! Those who spend their days lamenting about this method are all failures. To rule a nation, you have to remain indifferent to these things. Moreover, you must be willing to accept the ridicules of history. Once you are capable of carrying these burdens, then you are suited to be a leader of a nation! You cannot lead a nation with your heart or brotherly love, but with rules. This is the biggest difference between the royal court and Jiang Hu!\u201dChu Yang frowned as he thought about these words. He was wondering why Tie Bu Tian was saying these things to him.\u201cSo people say emperors are ruthless!\u201d Tie Bu Tian concluded, \u201cBecause if an emperor uses his heart, he would not be able to rule a nation. Everyone knows that brothers are valuable and reliable, but once a brother is praised and eclipses the leader he must be put down. Even if this brother is faithful, it has to done to fortify power. An emperor lives in constant torment. Their days are filled with ridicules and their nights are filled with agonizing tears.\u201d\u201cBut that price is fair, for stability of the kingdom and for peace in the world!\u201dTie Bu Tian turned his head and looked at Chu Yang, \u201cSenior Chu has no desires for the royal court. Senior Chu came to Iron Cloud as a person of Jiang Hu. But Senior Chu wants to borrow the strength of Iron Cloud to topple Diwu Qing Rou!\u201dTie Bu Tian took a deep breath and said slowly, \u201cThis is Senior Chu\u2019s main purpose!\u201d\u201cSenior Chu does not want have a subject/ruler relationship with Bu Tian. You want to work with Bu Tian as brothers. After everything is done, Senior Chu wants to return to Jiang Hu. These are Senior Chu\u2019s thoughts!\u201d\u201cSenior Chu is a Jiang Hu person to the core! This Jiang Hu pride is as high as a mountain so Senior Chu would never be content under anyone\u2019s command! And certainly not under anyone\u2019s control!\u201dHe smiled showing a trace of sadness, and slowly asked, \u201cSenior Chu, is Bu Tian correct?\u201dChu Yang was terrified as he looked at Tie Bu Tian. Even though his eyes remained calm as if his mind was completely innocent, he was shocked. This was Tie Bu Tian\u2019s first conversation with Chu Yang, but he saw right through Chu Yang\u2019s thoughts.Such a mind made Chu Yang see the person in front of him in a different light.\u201cYour Highness is correct.\u201d Chu Yang said casually, \u201cThat is exactly how I feel.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Tie Bu Tian laughed bitterly, \u201cThis is our first meeting; I wanted to make this issue clear. Because if Senior Chu continues to work with this mentality, then there will surely be contradictions with Bu Tian. And these contradictions between the royal court and Jiang Hu are irreconcilable.\u201d\u201cYour Highness worries too much.\u201d Chu Yang said sincerely, \u201cWhat Your Highness worries about is the contradictions that will rise after peace is restored. I have never been interested in the power of the royal court. Once Diwu Qing Rou is toppled, you will never have to see Chu Yang again!\u201d\u201cI know that this is, of course, Senior Chu\u2019s decision!\u201d Tie Bu Tian sighed, \u201cBut I am also sure that, when that time comes, many territories of Iron Cloud would not be maintained with Senior Chu gone! The moment Senior Chu leaves, Iron Cloud Nation would fall into turmoil!\u201d\u201cYour Highness, may I ask how old you are?\u201d Chu Yang asked.\u201cI have wasted nineteen years already.\u201d Tie Bu Tian\u2019s eyes suddenly showed a melancholy and lost look.\u201cYour Highness has been immersed too deep in the tactics and strategies of the royal court.\u201d Chu Yang said sharply, \u201cWith you, everything has to be measured by the royal court, has to be thought over before a choice is made, has to be weighted by the benefits, and has to be seen as a part of a greater picture; all of these things are too tiring and unnecessary!\u201d\u201cYour Highness worries too much, but forgets one thing. This one thing must be measured and considered; it is life or death, victory or failure that is about to come.\u201dChu Yang continued coldly, \u201cCurrently, Iron Cloud Nation is like a candle in the wind; it could go out at any moment. Great Zhao has ten times the national strength of Iron Cloud Nation; it has daring soldiers and strong leaders. Great Zhao Nation also has ten Great Dragon Tiger Generals, each one with a thousand victories under their belts. Diwu Qing Rou is especially talented, Great Zhao\u2019s best resource. He is an incredible tactician, with an icy heart and an ambition to rule the continent.\u201d\u201cIron Cloud could fall at any time, six hundred million people at the border of life and death. Facing such enormous danger and Your Highness could only think about the peaceful future.\u201d Chu Yang sneered, \u201cI did not know Your Highness is that confident, or perhaps arrogant is the right word! If Your Highness keeps holding on to the mentality that you could fight with Diwu Qing Rou, Chu Yang might as well retire to the wilderness and just not care about any of this.\u201dTie Bu Tian\u2019s countenance changed. He looked at Chu Yang for a while, then suddenly tilted his body and bowed, \u201cSenior Chu\u2019s words are true. Bu Tian is honored to learn from you. Currently, we should not talk about that future\u2026\u201dIn this meeting, the two people had sparred with each other. And Chu Yang currently seemed to have the upper hand.Tie Bu Tian went through all the trouble of saying those things to eliminate Chu Yang\u2019s conviction to Jiang Hu and make Chu Yang willingly become one of his subjects. Even though there were some truths in what he said, they were somewhat overexaggerated and biased.Chu Yang\u2019s counterattack was proof that his decision would not change. Moreover, he pointed out the errors of Tie Bu Tian\u2019s thoughts. His words were naturally overstated, not giving Tie Bu Tian any room for rebuttal. Chu Yang also knew that Tie Bu Tian was suffering under great pressure from Diwu Qing Rou; how could Tie Bu Tian not think about life and death, victory and failure?If anything, Tie Bu Tian probably thought about this every day.Chu Yang\u2019s counterattack simply made use of the wordings, not Tie Bu Tian\u2019s actual thoughts.Tie Bu Tian used the whole world to pressure Chu Yang. Chu Yang immediately countered with Diwu Qing Rou as well as the six hundred million people of Iron Cloud Nation for good measure.Both somewhat overstated their points. Both also understood each other\u2019s intentions. They just did not say them outright, because such directness would be too confrontational. At that time, Tie Bu Tian\u2019s loss would not be minimal, and Chu Yang\u2019s purpose would be difficult to achieve. Therefore, the two sides naturally formed a delicate balance.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euUnder pressure from Chu Yang\u2019s last statement, Tie Bu Tian had to take a step back and admit defeat in this battle of wits. However, it helped him prove that he was a person capable of accepting the ideas of others.\u201cSenior Chu, your words are definitely as sharp as a knife.\u201d Tie Bu Tian smiled.\u201cYour Highness also had a solid defense.\u201d Chu Yang smiled likewise.\u201cSenior Chu has wasted much thoughts on your journey to Iron Cloud. First,your appearance was like a bolt of lightning, giving me quite a shock. At that time, I immediately wanted to recruit your talent. After that, you had Saintly Physician Du\u2019s help in recommending you, taking advantage of my urgent need for talents!\u201dTie Bu Tian sighed and smiled, \u201cAfter the completion of all this, Senior Chu did not even bother to come and see me. Instead, you used Heavenly Armament Pavilion as a force that Iron Cloud Nation could not resist. Because of that, Senior Chu\u2019s position went up another level. Moreover, it created a strong impression at the highest level of Iron Cloud Nation\u2019s royal court. So much so that Royal Uncle, himself, went to see you. From there, you showcased your strength and great insights on worldly matters! Finally, Senior Chu simply sat at Heavenly Armament Pavilion and waited for my invitation.

However, this time I had no other choice but to act according to Senior Chu\u2019s plans. While I am taking a loss, it\u2019s still a happy one. Senior Chu made such an all-encompassing move. From a no-name with just the shirt on your back, you made such a position for yourself with your own bare hands. Moreover, your tactics clearly stated that Senior Chu would be no one\u2019s subject. You have given me no choice but to collaborate with you on our national military affairs!\u201dTie Bu Tian reluctantly smiled, \u201cSenior Chu was able to create such a circumstance alone. Clever, precise planning, seasoned grasp of the situation\u2026 You really made me admire you greatly! The two words talented person are truly suited for Senior Chu.\u201dChu Yang squinted and laughed, \u201cSuch words of praise, I am always happy to receive them, the more the better.\u201dThe negotiation period was now over. Plus, Tie Bu Tian had already conceded, so Chu Yang naturally wanted to create a friendlier atmosphere.Chu Yang\u2019s comment caught Tie Bu Tian by surprise. He was not able to hold back a giggle. And as if remembering something, he hastily wiped the edge of his mouth and smiled, \u201cSenior Chu is really funny.\u201dWithin this moment, Chu Yang shivered. He almost wanted to run away!The prince\u2026! What prince? Can a woman be called a prince? More like a princess?Tie Bu Tian was clearly a man, but he just acted one hundred percent girly! That smile, those eyes\u2026 Chu Yang\u2019s eyes widened as the edge of mouth twitched.Oh heavens\u2026!You let me go against fate, go against history\u2026 But now you want me to collaborate with this gay guy?Chu Yang convulsed internally. He thought to himself: No wonder this guy cultivated Icy Heart Jade Bone Saintly Technique. If a gay guy like that did not cultivate it\u2026 that would be a waste\u2026Once Tie Bu Tian finished pretending to wipe his mouth and once again emitted an all-encompassing aura, Chu Yang fell his hair stood on ends.

Suddenly, Chu Yang felt his future was dark and his life was full of tragedies\u2026\u201cSenior Chu, with the current state of Iron Cloud Nation, if Senior Chu was in charge, where would you begin?\u201d Tie Bu Tian smiled and asked seriously, as if he did not notice Chu Yang\u2019s mood changes.\u201cYes, this\u2026 I need a moment to think about it.\u201d Chu Yang put one hand on his forehead, pretending to be deep in thought. In truth, he did not need to think about it at all; it was just that previous scene had caused him to be too shaken up.\u201cIf you want to eliminate the foreign invasion, you need to first deal with internal pacification.\u201d Chu Yang placed all of his efforts into activating Nine Tribulations Transcending the Nine Heavens Technique to suppress the troublesome thoughts.If you want to eliminate the foreign invasion, you need to first deal with internal pacification\u2026 Tie Bu Tian could not help but shiver when he heard these words. Why did these words sound so familiar? The first time he heard these words, there was a great change in the royal court. The second time he heard them, three million soldiers became dried bones in the battlefield\u2026 The third time he heard them was when the royal court was convening. At that time, Royal Uncle Tie Long Cheng raised his saber and sorted out the officials all at once, creating a river of blood!Today, Chu Yang came here, and his first priority was these words.Could there be another period of wind and rain of blood?\u201cYes, that is right.\u201d Tie Bu Tian smiled and said, \u201cBut the problem is\u2026 the foreign invasion might be in the open, but internal turmoil is hidden.\u201d\u201cThey just need to be screened.\u201d Chu Yang smiled confidently.\u201cWhat if I give Senior Chu total control of this process?\u201d Tie Bu Tian smiled as he formally submitted a collaboration request.\u201cStill not enough!\u201d Chu Yang shook his head.\u201cNot enough?\u201d\u201cI hear that Your Highness created a Bu Tian Pavilion?\u201d Chu Yang asked casually, \u201cIf we are to collaborate, we should trust each other. I want Bu Tian Pavilion!\u201dTie Bu Tian looked at him coldly. His cold gaze continued for a while as he remained motionless.After a long time, Tie Bu Tian stood up. He clasped his hands behind his back and slowly walked to the gazebo\u2019s railing. His eyes followed the twinkling water in the afternoon light. A gentle wind glided over the lake and made his white robe flutter.\u201cBefore I was eleven, I was an innocent child, loved by my father and mother\u2026 As for my six older sisters, they treated me like a treasure\u2026 I was carefree\u2026 The world was beautiful.\u201d At this moment, Tie Bu Tian\u2019s back was facing Chu Yang. His eyes were starting to become hazy, but his voice was just as calm as before.\u201cWhen I was born, my father was really sad. He banned all talks of my birth. Back then, I did not understand why.\u201d\u201cOne year, father put on his golden armor and went to war! In my eyes, he looked like a god of war, unbreakable, undefeatable! But in less than half a year, my world crashed down! My father was carried home, dying.\u201d\u201cWhen my mother came to take care of him, he suddenly became angry and killed her with his sword! He single-handedly killed his beloved wife!\u201d Two streams of tears rolled down Tie Bu Tian\u2019s cheeks.Chu Yang looked up in surprise. He was startled by what he just heard. Why did this emperor of Iron Cloud Nation kill his wife?\u201cAfter that, father suddenly became lucid. He ordered all of my six sisters and their families killed! Then he ordered Second Uncle and his troops from the battlefield to come back and attack the palace, killing everyone! That day, inside of the imperial city, blood formed a river. Everyone thought Second Uncle was usurping the throne; it was not until later that they found out it was not the case.\u201d\u201cAfter that, father held my hand, and said these words before falling into a coma.\u201d Tie Bu Tian stood erect, but his quiet voice was trembling. He continued with a firm but pained voice, \u201cFrom now on you are called Tie Bu Tian! The sky (Tian) of Iron Cloud Nation has collapsed, but I hope you could help repair (Bu) it. You need to always remember: to rule a nation, you have to be cruel! If you have the cruelty to kill the enemies, you also must have the cruelty to kill yourself!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAfter he finished talking, father held second uncle\u2019s hand and simply said \u2018I am entrusting him to you.\u2019 And father immediately became unconscious\u2026\u201dChu Yang frowned and silently thought: This story of Tie Bu Tian has many unclear details. But one thing was for sure; when the emperor killed his wife and daughters, his mind was lucid! People say fierce tigers do not eat their young; why did he have to do that?Chu Yang had the feeling that there was some great secret in this whole story!Tie Bu Tian took a deep breath and continued, \u201cI hated father, hated him for killing all of my family! Second Uncle was extremely strict with me. He announced to everyone that I was the prince of Iron Cloud, and once I grew up, I would be Iron Cloud\u2019s ruler. And from that time on, Second Uncle invited countless masters to teach me about many things. Each day, there were at least ten masters waiting for me. Each day, I could only sleep for an hour. Even when I am eating and drinking, there was someone in front of me, teaching me. Whenever I slacked off a bit, Second Uncle would give me a beating. At that time, out of three hundred sixty-five days, there were at least three hundred days when I was black and blue. Second Uncle\u2019s strictness toward me surpassed that of the most difficult teacher in the world!\u201dTie Bu Tian said lightly, \u201cI went to see father often. Even though he had moments where he was awake, he would insist on killing himself at those times. And after he was prevented from doing so, he would quietly cry\u2026 Year after year, he would hold on to my mother and sisters\u2019 name plaques with tears running down his face. He usually cried until he became unconscious. His body also became weaker by the day\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Is he miserable? He deserves to be miserable!\u201d\u201cEven now, I still hate him! However, after many years, especially when I started to understand this situation, I found it more difficult to hate him.\u201d Tie Bu Tian continued to clasp his hands behind his back as tears ran down his cheeks. His eyes reflected conflicting feelings.\u201cIt was not until these past few years that I realized my father\u2019s heart is filled with agony. As a father, the sufferings he has to bear; as a man, the responsibilities he has to take; especially as an emperor, the burdens he has to endure are even more so.\u201dTie Bu Tian took a deep breath, \u201cAs for me\u2026 I was always under Second Uncle\u2019s unrelenting pressure to learn everything. There were countless times when I had to learn so much that I could not bear it and just cried. I continued to cry like that and Second Uncle would use the whip or the fist to get me back to my senses\u2026 I kept going like that. As the days went by I had to learn not just philosophy, but mental fortification, tactics, martial arts, and ruling strategies. Second Uncle carved those words father said to me on my table, hung them on my bedroom wall, and many other places that I went to. I was forced to recite these words before every meal\u2026\u201d\u201cSecond Uncle fought in the battlefield and planned strategies; he was the deciding factor in victory or defeat. At the same time, he held control of the entire nation. During that time, he was so busy he could barely open his eyes; he did not even have time to talk to me. However, he always saved time to talk to my teachers about what I learned; and afterward, he would give me a beating, as if he would never be satisfied with me\u2026\u201d\u201cIn the end, I did not dare to slack off anymore\u2026\u201d There was a gulping sound from Tie Bu Tian\u2019s throat like he swallowed something. He continued, \u201cI hated father, and I hated Second Uncle even more\u2026 But one day, I accidentally saw Second Uncle using Dark Flower Juice to dye his hair. At the time, he was only thirty-two years old. Second Uncle was extremely valiant; in Iron Cloud, he was famous for being handsome. But since father became ill, white hair began to appear on his head, until there was more white than black. Therefore, Second Uncle had to periodically dye his hair.\u201d\u201cAt the time I looked down on Second Uncle. What kind of man worried about his looks and dyed his hair? Later, I realized, because father was sick and I was still young, Second Uncle alone bore the weight of Iron Cloud Nation! His good health was Iron Cloud Nation\u2019s greatest hope! If the soldiers found out that his head was full of white hair, it would be an immeasurable shock to the military!\u201d\u201cEvery day, Second Uncle was either on the battlefield or training soldiers. He looked powerful; he only needed to yell once and the hearts of hundreds of thousands of soldiers trembled. But every night when he came home, he could not even lift his legs! Even talking was difficult. His hands shook while he ate\u2026 He was a Revered Martial Artist at the time! But each day he was exhausted to that point\u2026\u201d\u201cAfter I understood father and Second Uncle\u2019s suffering, I began to put all of my efforts into learning. Each time he came home from a battle campaign against Diwu Qing Rou, he would go over them with me a few dozen times! About three years ago, I finally started to grasp everything and began my life as a true prince. That\u2019s when I discovered that all the decisions Second Uncle made before were in my name. All of Iron Cloud Nation, even the whole world, knew that there was a heaven-born ruler in Iron Cloud! All of Iron Cloud was filled with hope!\u201d\u201cHowever, no one knew how such a heaven-born ruler came into being. How could there be such a thing as a heaven-born ruler? How many people know that the path of a ruler is full of cruelty?\u201d Tie Bu Tian\u2019s voice became sorrowful and cynical.\u201cWhen I first took control, nothing was done well. Luckily, there was Second Uncle; he was my angel. Every day he stood by me when the royal court convened. Anyone who disrespected or questioned my authority, he immediately had them dragged out and beheaded. Second Uncle became even worse than tyrants; but after I had a firm grip on Iron Cloud, Second Uncle did not bother to get involved in royal court affairs any longer.\u201d\u201cI heard that after he continually watched over me for three months, he went home and said to Second Aunt, \u2018I am relieved.\u2019 Afterward, Second Uncle immediately went to sleep for three days straight, giving everyone at home a fright.\u201dTie Bu Tian sighed and continued, \u201cThe military and politics of Iron Cloud were finally on the right track. I then founded Bu Tian Pavilion to gather heroes. I have always hoped to find someone to help me carry some of this weight.\u201d\u201cFor the stability of Iron Cloud, for the livelihood of six hundred million people, the pain that those of us at the top have paid with is unimaginable!\u201d\u201cI am too tired! Second Uncle is too tired!\u201d Tie Bu Tian said lightly. His tone was really casual, but Chu Yang could hear the fatigue hidden in it.\u201cSecond Uncle had recommended you to me.\u201d Tie Bu Tian still did not turn around but his voice was firm, \u201cI trust my uncle\u2019s judgments, so I will trust you! You need Bu Tian Pavilion, I can comply! However, you can only get the position of Adjunct Minister. I cannot directly give you a higher position than this. I am sure you can understand.\u201d\u201cOnly when you have earned the respect of everyone, can I give you full access of Bu Tian Pavilion! If there is mistrust, then there is no working together; if we\u2019re already working together, then I will trust you!\u201d Tie Bu Tian finished and walked out without turning back. He glided on the water surface like a cloud in the wind. He gently touched the water a few times and created little ripples on the surface of the lake. After that he disappeared from Chu Yang\u2019s view.He did not turn around because he did not want Chu Yang to see the tears that covered his face\u2026\u2026Chu Yang slowly sat down and was silent for a long time. He was still digesting Tie Bu Tian\u2019s words. They were truly sincere, honest and moving.Chu Yang did think that Tie Bu Tian\u2019s motive in telling him these things was to win him over, so he could lay down his life for Tie Bu Tian! Chu Yang was someone who was seasoned with two lifetimes of experience. In his previous life, while Chu Yang was in Upper Three Heavens, he inadvertently learned Deep Spirit Principle. Now was the perfect time to use it to carefully evaluate everything that was said.Deep Spirit Principle was a really strange technique. It did not have any power, but could detect all falsehoods! This technique was a legacy of the Heavenly Three Star Clan. It ensured that the person with this technique would not be deceived by anyone.But under the analysis of Deep Spirit Principle, Chu Yang discovered that all of Tie Bu Tian\u2019s words were true!In his words, there were many holes and many things that could not be explained. But that was the strangest part. Anyone would have seen these holes in Tie Bu Tian\u2019s words, but his words were one hundred percent true!For example, why did the emperor of Iron Cloud, after his great injury, kill his wife? Why did he kill his six daughters and their families? Why did he order a blood purge on the royal court?All these things had no clear explanations! But they were the truth!Chu Yang also did not know what had happened. Even after he reviewed the history of his previous life, he could not figure it out. In any case, Tie Bu Tian died too early in his previous life, before Chu Yang had a chance to help.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis whole thing was filled with layers of fog! Chu Yang felt that there was some great hidden secret, as forceful as a mountain and as burdensome as an ocean!Chu Yang sat and thought for a long time only to discover that his mind was as foggy as ever! He stopped bothering to give it more thought. The royal family is too complicated. If I want to figure out the mind of an emperor, it\u2019s even more so. I tried to guess but there are really no clues. There\u2019s really no more hope on that end.Chu Yang only needed to know that Tie Bu Tian met his conditions for collaboration.In this process, Tie Bu Tian did not even bother to haggle. Of course, this was because Tie Bu Tian was an open-minded person. Plus, Chu Yang was a useful person and that certainly helped the ruler to be magnanimous. Besides these things, Tie Bu Tian had the mind to take a gamble on this collaboration.However, there was a very important factor that Chu Yang understood full well. It was Icy Heart Jade Bone Saintly Technique. This type of technique and Deep Spirit Principle were slightly different but had similar results. Even though Icy Heart Jade Bone Saintly Technique was not capable of discovering lies, it helped seeing through people\u2019s hearts. This gave Tie Bu Tian an incredible intuition!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 85 \u2013 Adjunct MinisterTie Bu Tian clearly understood Chu Yang\u2019s thoughts. Even though he did not have any solid basis, he absolutely believed that Chu Yang would not harm him or Iron Cloud Nation. Additionally, he was sure that Chu Yang would not abuse his position in Iron Cloud to achieve some dark plot!If he was sure about all these things and Chu Yang\u2019s incredible abilities, then Tie Bu Tian would of course give it a try! At this point, he desperately needed someone to help. Carrying the burden all by himself had made him exhausted! He needed someone to share it with, but none of the civil and military officials in court could help.Because no matter what, he was a prince and they were just his subjects!Chu Yang\u2019s appearance perfectly made up for this deficiency! Even though Chu Yang would never be subjugated under him, it was the exact thing that made Chu Yang, a man of Jiang Hu with no connections to the court, the best candidate to take charge of Bu Tian Pavilion!With anyone else from the groups of civil and military officials holding a sharp weapon like this Bu Tian Pavilion, Tie Bu Tian would be worried! As for himself, he founded Bu Tian Pavilion in earnest, but did not have enough energy to manage and develop it into something powerful.Therefore, when Tie Bu Tian complied with Chu Yang\u2019s request earlier, he had his own reasons as well.Or who knows what other reasons he might have.As for Chu Yang, at this time, he was currently thinking about Tie Bu Tian\u2019s childhood\u2026 it was truly a tragedy. Even compared to a prince of some normal country, Tie Bu Tian\u2019s childhood was many times worse.As Tie Bu Tian said, the path of a ruler was a cruel one!\u2026\u201cYour Heavenly Armament Pavilion\u2026 What to do with it?\u201d When Chu Yang met with Tie Bu Tian again it was already late in the afternoon. He had already recovered his natural composure as he smiled and asked.\u201cHeavenly Armament Pavilion\u2026\u201d Chu Yang originally wanted to merge Heavenly Armament Pavilion with Bu Tian Pavilion, but when the words reached his mouth, they came out quite differently, \u201cHeavenly Armament Pavilion would of course exist independently. However, it cannot remain as it currently is; it\u2019s too wasteful. Your Highness, my Heavenly Armament Pavilion will be moved to Emerald Flow Lake; is that okay?\u201dEmerald Flow Lake was a small lake inside of Iron Cloud Citadel. It was about ten blocks from Iron Cloud Inner City, but they were separated by a dense area of buildings, so it seemed really far away. This was a favorite area for people to go for a stroll.\u201cEmerald Flow Lake? Not a problem.\u201d Tie Bu Tian readily agreed, \u201cI will immediately arrange for this.\u201d Tie Bu Tian thought the \u201cwasteful\u201d part Chu Yang was referring to was those divine weapons; he did not know that Chu Yang was in fact referring to Gu Du Xing.Such a powerful expert with limitless potential left to sit around idly\u2026 that was really wasteful!Chu Yang\u2019s countenance remained unchanged, but he was overjoyed on the inside.Only he knew that Emerald Flow Lake was not just a good place for a stroll. In his previous life, this was where he found the second Nine Tribulations Sword fragment!Now he could directly take over this area, then all he would have to do is wait until his cultivation was high enough to break the seal of the second Nine Tribulations Sword fragment. And finally, he could take it without anyone knowing.Nine Tribulations Sword, second fragment! Chu Yang was burning with excitement.The two boarded a carriage and went forth. This carriage was completely covered without any openings. If someone from the outside were to look, they would not expect that the prince was sitting in this ordinary looking carriage.Though the inside of the carriage was quite spacious, the two were sitting not too far from each other\u2026 Chu Yang could smell a faint fragrance that seemed to be drifting in the air. He could not help but snort. Internally, he was annoyed. How can a man wear perfume?Tie Bu Tian seemed to have realized something was amiss. So he started to distract Chu Yang with a rambling conversation about some irrelevant topics. Tie Bu Tian\u2019s education was truly profound. From heaven to earth, from legends to current famous figures, he could talk about them all. Moreover, regardless of whatever the topic was, he seemed to have some insightful comment about each one.In terms of his education, Chu Yang trailed behind Tie Bu Tian by a great distance. The only thing he could do was listen. Time slowly passed and Chu Yang became more and more engrossed in Tie Bu Tian\u2019s words; he did not notice the fragrance in the carriage anymore.The carriage stopped.The two got off the carriage and went into a large manor.\u201cThis is Bu Tian Pavilion\u2019s headquarters.\u201d Tie Bu Tian said softly as he walked. Chu Yang replied with an \u201coh\u201d, feeling really surprised.For anyone who heard of the three words \u201cBu Tian Pavilion\u201d, a grand building would come to mind. However, it turned out to be just an ordinary one story building.So that place with the plaque \u201cBu Tian Pavilion\u201d and the small lake that Tie Bu Tian had his first discussion with me at was just a cover? To Chu Yang, that place felt more appropriate for the three words \u201cBu Tian Pavilion.\u201dThis place was a little too ordinary.Walking into the building, Tie Bu Tian brought Chu Yang straight into the main hall without stopping. There were a few people there discussing something; when they saw Tie Bu Tian entering, they immediately stood up and greeted him.\u201cThis person is Chu Yang, Senior Chu.\u201d Tie Bu Tian introduced, \u201cFrom today on, Senior Chu is a person of our Bu Tian Pavilion. His temporary position is Adjunct Minister of Bu Tian Pavilion. From now on, Senior Chu will be participating in all of Bu Tian Pavilion\u2019s matters, from planning to decision-making.\u201dIn the room, all five faces changed at once.Adjunct Minister, this was no ordinary position. If the word \u201cAdjunct\u201d was left out then he was Bu Tian Pavilion\u2019s Minister. Before this, the minister position belonged to Tie Bu Tian; this position was even higher than Pavilion Lord.Could it be that this youth is the future Minister of Bu Tian Pavilion?They were all extremely surprised. Tie Bu Tian had brought a youth in to take over this important Minister position. Currently, the Pavilion Lord and his deputy were also present in this room. The other three people were all Martial Great Masters. How could they just tolerate a youth being above them?\u201cThis is Bu Tian Pavilion\u2019s Lord, Icy Soul Revered Saber Artist, Cheng Zi Ang. This is his deputy, Shooting Star Revered Martial Artist, Chen Yu Tong.\u201d Tie Bu Tian introduced each person to Chu Yang. All five faces managed to smile and came up to greet him one by one.Icy Soul Revered Saber Artist Cheng Zi Ang seemed to be about sixty. He had gray hair and a thin body that seemed capable of getting blown away with a strong gust of wind. As for Chen Yu Tong, he was a large man with a strong build. He was about forty-five or forty-six years old with a crude face.They both looked and evaluated Chu Yang with their gazes. In their smiles, there were traces of alienation.After the brief introduction, Tie Bu Tian brought Chu Yang into an inner room. This was a study filled with documents lying in piles and piles.\u201cThis is where Bu Tian Pavilion keeps all of the documents on all of Iron Cloud Nation\u2019s personnel. Each one has carefully accounted details from great to small. All the events that happened in their lives, as well as things such as personal abilities or skills are all written down. You can look\u2026 Normally, a person with cultivation level below Martial Master would not be allowed to join Bu Tian Pavilion. Someone with unclear background would not be able to join either.\u201dTie Bu Tian slowly continued, \u201cAt present, Bu Tian Pavilion has a total of eighty-seven people. Within this group there are one Revered Saber Artist, five Revered Martial Artists, and thirteen Martial Great Masters. The rest are Martial Masters of grade four and up.\u201d\u201cThis strength is weak. Too weak!\u201d Chu Yang shook his head. Such strength in a sect would be incredibly powerful, but placed in a war between two large nations, it was too little.Compared to Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s Golden Horse Riders Department, this strength was not enough. In fact, it did not even earn the right to compare to Golden Horse Riders Department.Golden Horse Riders Department was already well-established with about thirty thousand people! Even if you didn\u2019t count the support staff, the number of experts at the level of Martial Master and above were about twenty thousand!Such a horrific number, how could a newcomer like Bu Tian Pavilion compare?\u201cUntil now, Bu Tian Pavilion, with its status as my personal force, only dealt with strategies. Our few assassination attempts have all ended in failure. Instead of success, we lost many people.\u201d Tie Bu Tian said slowly, \u201cBecause of this, I dare not develop it any further.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euChu Yang lightly nodded.Even though Tie Bu Tian did not say it outright, Chu Yang heard: There are spies in Bu Tian Pavilion!As long as there were spies, unknown ones, no matter how rigorously the assassination attempts were planned, they would still be a joke\u2026 It was no different than sending your subordinates straight into the hands of the enemies!\u201cThis is the first problem you have to solve.\u201d Tie Bu Tian said casually.\u201cNot a problem.\u201d Chu Yang glanced at the piles of documents and said decisively.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 86 \u2013 The new official must show off his authority\u201cThe second problem is that our Iron Cloud has countless spies sent by Diwu Qing Rou since so many years ago. And I am guessing many of them currently hold high positions on both the civil and military sides.\u201dTie Bu Tian smiled, \u201cSenior Chu, you once said, \u2018If you want to eliminate the foreign invasion, you need to first deal with internal pacification\u2026\u2019 Once you have successfully completed your first task in cleaning out Bu Tian Pavilion, this second task will be given to you as well\u2026 Your final task would be to fight with the two outside forces! But the stabilization of the country comes first.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mind if you have to kill a lot of people. In fact, to maintain stability, you can kill all the people here if it must be done.\u201d Tie Bu Tian smiled, \u201cBut there are some whose deaths would cause great turbulence in the world.\u201dChu Yang smiled mysteriously. He understood Tie Bu Tian\u2019s meaning. In other words, \u201cIf you cannot even complete the first task, then you should just leave. Don\u2019t even bother thinking about the second or third\u2026\u201dAs for what he called stabilization; it was not something he said for the moment, but the one thing that Iron Cloud needed most right now!Currently, stability was much more important to Iron Cloud than the rapid development of strength. This had also been Tie Bu Tian\u2019s biggest headache for a very long time.\u201cSenior Chu, Bu Tian Pavilion will have to depend on you from now on.\u201d As Tie Bu Tian walked out the door, he turned his head back and smiled.\u201cBu Tian Pavilion, haha\u2026 Your Highness wants me to patch up the sky starting right now?\u201d Chu Yang laughed.\u201cSince Senior Chu sincerely wants to collaborate, then you should prove your ability. Divine weapons are just accessories after all; no matter how much you show them off, they\u2019re only as good as empty ranting.\u201d Tie Bu Tian smiled, \u201cBu Tian Pavilion will be your test.\u201d\u201cBu Tian Pavilion has been in existence for three years, yet it is still not quite developed.\u201d Tie Bu Tian\u2019s smile was full of hidden meanings as he waltzed out.From beginning to end, Tie Bu Tian only introduced Chu Yang and did not say any words of support. He did this so Chu Yang would have to use his own abilities to fortify his position, consolidate Bu Tian Pavilion, clean out the place, and finally, gain complete control. After this process was done, then it could be considered that he had completed his first task in his collaboration with Tie Bu Tian!Chu Yang was by himself with his Martial Warrior status. If he wanted to gain control of all of Bu Tian Pavilion, he needed to at least have the strength of a Martial Master. Moreover, he also needed their complete respect to establish his authority. This was an almost impossible task!However, Chu Yang could no longer go back. He was already here. He wanted respect; Tie Bu Tian gave him that. He wanted attention; Tie Bu Tian gave him that. His initial plan to create an important status for himself was completely successful. In fact, when he asked for the one thing that was most important to Tie Bu Tian, Bu Tian Pavilion, Tie Bu Tian also gave him that!Even though this Tie Bu Tian was a little girly and a little feminine in Chu Yang\u2019s eyes, he gave Chu Yang the trust he wanted without reservations.Everything that Chu Yang had wanted for his first step in Iron Cloud, he had achieved.Now was the time for him to show his abilities. If he could not earn the respect of the people in Bu Tian Pavilion, then he would prove that he was not worthy of Tie Bu Tian\u2019s trust!The current situation was essentially Chu Yang and Tie Bu Tian\u2019s collaboration to push Chu Yang to a point where he could no longer turn back!Tie Bu Tian left a long time ago, but Chu Yang was still engrossed in the endless documents. He carefully analyzed each line. These documents were just plain texts, and these texts were not exactly accurate compared to reality. But Chu Yang was looking for tiny bits of truths or flaws in these fuzzy reports. From there, he would decide on the next step.Picking through a lot of people who had already been through a rigorous screening process, moreover he was picking based on only what was written, the difficulty of this process was immense.However, Chu Yang could only start with this for now. Because he currently had no spies of his own, he could only rely on his own efforts!Chu Yang wholehearted believed that any organizations would have cracks where outsiders could enter. In Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s plans then, this place of Tie Bu Tian\u2019s must have had some flaws. Even the staff responsible for screening people to enter Bu Tian Pavilion might not have been loyal to Tie Bu Tian!Chu Yang used up the afternoon to carefully go through the files of the eighty-seven people in Bu Tian Pavilion. Within this short time period, he memorized them all!He closed his eyes and all eighty-seven individuals\u2019 files ran through his head all at once, without one detail left out!Chu Yang then walked out.\u201cMinister.\u201d Seeing Chu Yang come out, Icy Soul Revered Saber Artist Cheng Zi Ang stood up first, and the rest of the people behind him followed. Since the time Chu Yang arrived, there had been an addition of seven more people. There were now twelve people total.These people looked at Chu Yang with guarded gazes filled with hostility and mistrust, but when they saw him sit on the main seat, they greeted him respectfully. There were a lot of people with cynicism in their eyes, waiting to be entertained by a comedic skit.\u201cOfficial Cheng, from now on we are of the same house, there is no need for ceremony.\u201d Chu Yang said casually, making that Icy Soul Revered Saber Artist\u2019s mouth twitch a few times.You\u2019re acting like my superior? No need for ceremony? Moreover, in this statement, Chu Yang used \u201cOfficial Cheng\u201d and not \u201cSenior Cheng\u201d\u2026 he meant to indicate that he was using the rules of the royal court, not that of Jiang Hu.One rank higher was enough to crush the people below!Chu Yang\u2019s first sentence told Cheng Zi Ang that even though he was a Revered Saber Artist, this was the royal court, under the prince\u2019s command! Even if a weakling student was your superior, you would still have to obey!In Chu Yang\u2019s mind, he did look down a little on this Revered level expert. Since ancient times, there were many Revered level experts who ruled over Jiang Hu, but not many coveted worldly wealth and status.If you abandoned your place in Jiang Hu and went to work for the royal court, then you are nothing but a court official.Once you gave up that identity, you lowered yourself. You will never truly be a Revered level expert again! You could still hold on to that title, but if you have to come face to face with a Revered level expert from Jiang Hu\u2026 Cheng Zi Ang, you don\u2019t stand half a chance of winning!\u201cOfficial Cheng, please let everyone from Bu Tian Pavilion who is currently in Iron Cloud Citadel know that there will be a gathering early tomorrow morning.\u201d Chu Yang said casually, \u201cI am a newly instated official and I want to show my authority a little bit; this is pretty standard. I hope Official Cheng will wholeheartedly assist me in this matter!\u201dCheng Zi Ang was stunned.This new adjunct minister is too straightforward! Even if he wanted to show off his authority, did he have to say it outright like that?*****************When Chu Yang came back to Heavenly Armament Pavilion that night he heard the sound of wind swooshing from the backyard. Of course, Gu Du Xing was practicing his sword art.Chu Yang stood on the steps and watched Gu Du Xing practice, but inside, he was contemplating.This Gu Du Xing, should I bring him out with me? His fighting strength in this Iron Cloud Citadel is that of an expert. Having him with me would greatly help me in solving any problems I might encounter.After all, I am currently only a grade four Martial Warrior.Looking at the flashing sword in the backyard, Chu Yang finally shook his head. It was better that Gu Du Xing did not show himself. Bu Tian Pavilion was Bu Tian Pavilion, and Gu Du Xing\u2019s strength was insurance for the two martial brothers in this Iron Cloud Citadel.Keeping an ace card like this hidden, regardless of the situation, was much better than showing it to everyone.\u201cElder Brother Chu, you\u2019re back.\u201d Gu Du Xing was done with his sword practice. His clothes were soaked and his face was pale; he had used up a lot of energy. It looked like he had started to understand Revered Berserker Sword Technique.Gu Du Xing was really curious when it came to Chu Yang. Chu Yang is much younger than me; this is sure enough. But I don\u2019t understand why every time I talk to Chu Yang, he seems much more mature than I am.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Du Xing was sure that Chu Yang was younger than him, but Chu Yang never brought up the age difference between the two. This gave Gu Du Xing a headache; how was he supposed to address him?Should you keep calling me Elder Brother Gu? Should I keep calling you Elder Brother Chu?Of course Chu Yang would never talk about age with Gu Du Xing. If it was based on age\u2026 would he not be the lower-ranking one? Such a position, he would not be so stupid as to voluntarily enter into one.Gu Du Xing also could not see through Chu Yang\u2019s cultivation level. Was this youth a Martial Great Master? Or a Revered Martial Artist? Gu Du Xing dared not guess lower; he only guessed higher and higher.If Gu Du Xing found out that Chu Yang was currently just a Martial Warrior, he probably would collapse on the spot\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 87 \u2013 In the future, we won\u2019t stay here\u201cUm\u2026 Elder Brother Gu, our Heavenly Armament Pavilion is going to change location soon.\u201d Chu Yang said casually, \u201cIt will be moved to Emerald Flow Lake. As for me, I have agreed with Tie Bu Tian in becoming the Minister of Bu Tian Pavilion.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d Gu Du Xing wiped his sweat. Clearly, he had no interest in this Bu Tian Pavilion.\u201cElder Brother Gu, I have this idea.\u201d Chu Yang and Gu Du Xing walked side by side as they talked, \u201cGiven the current situation, we need to have our own forces to get things done. Since Heavenly Armament Pavilion only has the two of us, we\u2019re spread a little thin.\u201dGu Du Xing\u2019s eyes brightened, \u201cYou mean?\u201d\u201cWhether it is to protect our lives or to do some great deeds in this troubled world, we need to have an elite team in our hands. Moreover, the Middle Three Heavens that we are aiming for is even more troublesome compared to Lower Three Heavens. It\u2019s even more lawless; there is only one rule there, big fish swallow little fish. At the least, saving Gu Miao Ling would require strength.\u201dChu Yang continued, \u201cThere are some things you don\u2019t need me to say. The Gu clan has its own successor, and you are only their adopted son\u2026 With this fact, even at the peak of Sword Emperor level, your saving Gu Miao Ling would be dependent on the how the people of the Gu clan felt. Any family clan would place its survival ahead of one person\u2019s life.\u201dGu Du Xing\u2019s face darkened.Everything Chu Yang said was true. Based on their ages, by the time he achieved Sword Emperor, the two Gu young masters would already hold power. Currently, the two were busy fighting for power so they were not paying attention to this situation. Once Gu Miao Ling is freed, everything would change. First, he was an adopted son, not an outsider. Second, his cultivation level of Sword Emperor would make him the most powerful person in the Gu clan. Third, marrying Gu Miao Ling would make him the son-in-law of the Gu clan.It would be odd if the two Gu brothers did not guard against him.\u201cOur Heavenly Armament Pavilion needs to become more powerful quickly.\u201d Chu Yang\u2019s gaze became more profound, \u201cYou will be the first divine weapon of Heavenly Armament Pavilion!\u201d\u201cOnce you have a first, then there will be a second.\u201d Gu Du Xing\u2019s eyes brightened with great interest, \u201cHow do you want to proceed?\u201d\u201cThe development of Heavenly Armament Pavilion cannot be publicized; it must grow in secret.\u201d Chu Yang said as he rubbed his chin, \u201cAs for the specifics of this development, it will be up to you. I will not deal with that. Additionally, we should temporarily put the weapons of Heavenly Armament Pavilion aside. Once the recruits have sufficient skill, we will give them those. That would be good motivation.\u201dGu Du Xing\u2019s eyes emitted sharp rays of lights as he nodded repeatedly, \u201cYes, our divine weapons would be an irresistible temptation for any martial artist.\u201d\u201cThe second thing is our Heavenly Armament Pavilion will develop secretly so we do not necessarily need masters; we should concentrate on those with the potential to advance to such levels!\u201d Chu Yang smiled, his eyes were like bright flashes in the dark, \u201cIn the future, we will not only stay in Lower Three Heavens, but advance to Middle Three Heavens\u2026 and then Upper Three Heavens as well! We will kill and fight to our top position!\u201d\u201cThose we recruit will be part of our team; they will advance with us. From fighting in Lower Three Heavens to bathing in Jiang Hu blood in Middle Three Heavens, even when we are in Upper Three Heavens, we will walk arrogantly!Gu Du Xing\u2019s face was radiant. His breathing had become more rapid, \u201cDo you mean\u2026\u201d\u201cWe won\u2019t work by the rules of others. What we want\u2026 is to set rules for others to follow!\u201d Chu said quietly, \u201cRegardless if it is Lower Three Heavens or Upper Three Heavens\u2026\u201d\u201cGood!\u201d A bright-eyed Gu Du Xing said, \u201cSince you already have such ambitions, I, Gu Du Xing can\u2019t just sit around. Let us two brothers join forces and see!\u201dChu Yang nodded and said deeply, \u201cI will leave this to you. In this time period, I need to quickly finish up things at Bu Tian Pavilion. Anyway, our mission at this Lower Three Heavens is to defeat Diwu Qing Rou. This absolutely cannot be changed.\u201d\u201cDefeat Diwu Qing Rou\u2026\u201d Gu Du Xing muttered and nodded. He did not know why Chu Yang was so insistent on defeating Diwu Qing Rou, but he knew that, having said it, Chu Yang must have his own reasons.Heavenly Armament Pavilion just opened for a few days\u2026 then closed.Gu Du Xing already went ahead to Emerald Flow Lake; at this time, his stubborn character clearly showed itself.With Chu Yang\u2019s generous financial backing, Gu Du Xing played a big hand and surrounded the area around Emerald Flow Lake with a thirty feet tall wall. In a sudden, he took over the entire area.At the time Gu Du Xing did this, even Chu Yang did not know.Chu Yang\u2019s original plan was to only take over the lake. He did not expect Gu Du Xing to directly take not only the entire lake, but also Shadow Hill near it as well. In total, he took a few acres of the surrounding area!Even though there were no homes or government offices in this area, it was a favorite area for people to go for a stroll. There were also many thriving businesses like brothels and gambling dens.With Gu Du Xing taking such a big bite, the others were certainly not happy. So he started making lots of noise.When people came to make trouble, Gu Du Xing showed off his cold dead face, warning them not to come close. When officials came to question him, they got beaten to black and blue and left. He even yelled after them, \u201cThis is the prince\u2019s order! If you are capable, don\u2019t find me; go find the prince!\u201dThe money Chu Yang gave him, other than spending on hiring workers and construction material, he did not have to spend on anything else.During this time, Official Chu Yang just got his position so he put all his efforts into showing off his authority.\u201cMy colleagues, today I gathered everyone here because I have just come into office. I needed you to know that. First, we need to become familiar with each other so we can easily work together. Second, there are some things I don\u2019t understand and I need your help in clarifying them. In other words, the new official will be showing off his authority today!\u201dThe Pavilion Lord and his deputy, sitting next to Chu Yang, sank down slightly. As for the people sitting in front of Chu Yang their faces were all gloomy.Chu Yang looked at the eighty-five people in front of him. His face was serious as he clasped his hands behind his back and paced back and forth; he was one hundred percent authoritative. With one look, he could easily tell that these eighty-five people as well as Cheng Zi Ang and Chen Yu Tong were not with the group welcoming Du Shi Qing. Moreover, those people were more skilled compared to these people by far.Tie Bu Tian really did not show all his strength.\u201cWho I am, I am sure everyone has already heard. Compared to everyone, I am probably just a student who could barely tie up a chicken. However, since I have undertaken this task the prince has given, I will use all my efforts to make Bu Tian Pavilion the best it could be! I hope you will cooperate and not make it difficult for me.\u201d Chu Yang smiled coldly, \u201cIf it becomes difficult for me, it would be even more difficult for you! This, I promise you!\u201dThere was a commotion and lots of whispering. Everyone here has been in Jiang Hu, and they felt Chu Yang\u2019s words were a little ridiculous. Threatening people? How many of us have not put our lives on the line? Threats? Stupid threats!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euStudent? A student wants to control Bu Tian Pavilion?Cheng Zi Ang and Chen Yu Tong looked at each other. They both did not know whether to laugh or to cry. It had always been the case that a newly appointed official showed off his authority a bit, but saying it straight out like this\u2026 Official Chu was definitely the first.\u201cThis is not Jiang Hu; it does not need Jiang Hu\u2019s rules. While this is not a military camp, it still needs its own rules. Moreover, it should be even stricter than that of military camps!\u201d Chu Yang took one glance and not letting anyone interject, he continued to show his authority, \u201cI will ask you now. Is there anyone who has opinions regarding my methods? If you do, you can leave immediately. I will not stop you!\u201dEveryone smiled awkwardly; once you joined a secret organization like this, how could you leave? The only exit was death.\u201cGood! If no one has any opinions, then you have all recognized my position. Then, from now on, for anyone who goes against my orders, there is only one punishment\u2026 death!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Big official Chu seemed as if he was carrying out a monologue by himself!\u201cI will now call a few names; the people with those names, please step forward.\u201d Chu Yang apparently did not care about what was going on because they were just as he expected.Chu Yang grabbed a stack of documents and called loudly, \u201cLiu Zu Guang.\u201dBelow, a middle-aged man with one eye reluctantly walked forward one step at a time.\u201cLiu Zu Guang, third grade Martial Master, from the area Thriving South. Three years ago, you fought with an enemy and lost one eye. This enemy was a ranger named Ping Wu Ying from the Clear Spring Prefecture of Great Zhao, correct?\u201dLiu Zu Guang slowly nodded, \u201cOfficial Chu, everyone knows about this.\u201d Implying: What you are saying is useless.\u201cPlease take one step forward.\u201d Chu Yang took two steps toward Liu Zu Guang and felt the pulse on his wrist. At the same time, he activated Deep Spirit Principle and Nine Tribulations Transcending the Nine Heavens Technique on his hand.Liu Zu Guang immediately pulled back. His eyes were as cold as two sword blades.\u201cYour main strength is hidden weapons. You were a disciple of Thriving South\u2019s Sun Clan, famous for their hidden weapon tactics. Sun Clan\u2019s hidden weapon tactics have one special thing about them; it is weak on the left and strong on the right. The left side only contributes thirty percent while the right, seventy percent. This combination is used together with their signature mental technique Return to Throwing Hand to throw weapons over a long distance, right?\u201d\u201cYes. Official Chu is indeed clever.\u201d Liu Zu Guang did not know whether he was being praised or mocked. Currently he was really nervous. This information about the Sun clan was top-secret, but this person said everything in one breath.\u201cHowever, these hidden weapon tactics of the Sun Clan, while clever, the weak left and strong right approach has one limitation. That is that all disciples of the Sun clan have one undeniable habit when facing the enemies. Their right eye are usually narrowed or closed altogether. In other words, they only use their left eye to aim at the enemies. Because of this, the left eyes of the Sun clan\u2019s disciples are the most critical part of their bodies. Without their left eyes, their hidden weapons tactics would be useless. Weak left and strong right might make it tough for the enemies to guard themselves, but it has a very strict requirement on the individuals practicing this tactic. Liu Zu Guang, one of your eyes was blinded by the enemy. And this was none other than your left eye, but your hidden weapons skill is still accurately thirty percent left and seventy percent right. Why is this?These words of Chu Yang made everyone sitting there change color. They all clearly understood the meaning of Chu Yang\u2019s words.Liu Zu Guang changed color; he said, \u201cIt is because of my left eye being blinded that I worked hard to train my right eye to replace my left. Official Chu, if a person stumbled once, can he not pick himself up again?\u201dChu Yang did not pay attention to his explanation, and said coldly, \u201cWhen I checked your meridians earlier, I discovered that the meridians of both your eyes are good and without any damage. You lost your left eye but your meridians are fine. Everyone knows that whether it is sword, saber, punch, or kick, they would all cause injuries to the meridians over a long period of time. If the injuries are serious, then your meridians would be damaged to the point where they get distorted completely.\u201d\u201cAnd you, while losing your left eye, still have the surrounding meridians intact. According to the report, you said that Ping Wu Ying punched your eye, destroying it. Haha\u2026, Liu Zu Guang, your enemy loved you so much that he blinded your eye and not damage one bit of the meridians. A person with cultivation level of Martial Master like Ping Wu Ying has such precise control of his power; that\u2019s impressive. Our Official Cheng at the level of Revered Saber Artist could not have such precise control\u2026 Liu Zu Guang, why don\u2019t you ask Official Cheng if he could do it?\u201dChu Yang smiled coldly, \u201cThe palace has its own physicians, and we have our own Bu Tian Pavilion physician right here as well. He could check you out. Liu Zu Guang, do you have any more to say?\u201dAt this point, Cheng Zi Ang and Chen Yu Tong\u2019s faces became pale as they sat in their seats.Chu Yang\u2019s words were simply basic knowledge of martial injuries. Every one of his words were true, but how did they not know? Damaging someone\u2019s eye without damaging his meridians, forget about a Martial Master, even Revered Saber Artist Cheng Zi Ang did not have the capability. To be able to do this, the cultivation level had to be at least Martial Monarch.If Liu Zu Guang\u2019s injury was like what Chu Yang said, then there was only one possibility: Liu Zu Guang was a spy and his injury was intentional. Besides this, there was no other explanation.Liu Zu Guang took one step back, blood completely drained from his face. Next to Chu Yang, Bu Tian Pavilion\u2019s physician stood up and was heading in his direction.On Liu Zu Guang\u2019s face there was a look of despair. He suddenly laughed and said, \u201cYes, kiddo, you are very powerful. I cannot believe I damaged my own body and came here as a spy only to be discovered by you. Not bad. I am Liu Xiao Cheng. Liu Zu Guang had died by my hand a long time ago. Haha, you might have uncovered my identity, but don\u2019t expect to get anything else from me.\u201d\u201cIn order to spy, you actually destroyed your own eye. Haha\u2026 such a desperate act would naturally get a lot of sympathy from others. Moreover, they would not inspect your eye\u2019s injury. Sacrificing an eye to spy is actually not too much of a price for you since you could use this to give people a misconception.\u201dChu Yang smiled coldly and said, \u201cBut you did not expect that, right now, no such misconceptions exist.\u201dLiu Xiao Cheng sneered, \u201cSo what? I can only die once.\u201dCheng Zi Ang\u2019s face reddened. He stood up and angrily said, \u201cLiu Xiao Cheng! Damn you! The two assassination attempts in Sun Citadel prefecture were foiled by you?Liu Xiao Cheng laughed, \u201cThe meat was placed in front of my mouth, why not eat it?\u201dCheng Zi Ang\u2019s whole body shook. He sent two people to assassinate a general of Great Zhao twice; one of those assassins was Cheng Zi Ang\u2019s disciple. He could not have imagined that his plans were in the hands of the enemies; they died in vain.Cheng Zi Ang was seized by uncontrollable anger; his eyes were completely red. At the same time, he was also filled with remorse. With a spy hidden in his own ranks, and one that he especially valued as well. He brought the lives of his own man and his disciple and handed them over to the enemies with both hands.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you.\u201d Cheng Zi Ang roared as his body flew forward.\u201cStop, capture him alive.\u201d Chen Yu Tong quickly yelled.With the enemy\u2019s spy in front of them, it was more useful to capture him alive. Who knew how many of more than eighty people left were of his kind?\u201cHaha, Chen Yu Tong, no need for such wishful thinking. I am not really thinking about living anymore.\u201d Liu Xiao Cheng laughed loudly, and then his body suddenly jolted. His eyeballs rolled and black blood leaked out of the edge of his mouth. It was poison. He had long ago hidden a highly toxic poison in his mouth.Bam! Liu Xiao Cheng\u2019s body fell on the group. It twitched a little and then there was no movement.Cheng Zi Ang roared angrily. He kicked Liu Xiao Cheng\u2019s body and yelled, \u201cCheck Liu Xiao Cheng\u2019s background. I want to kill his entire family, all nine generations.\u201d (TLN: great great grandfather to great great grandchild)Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euCheng Zi Ang was ashamed and humiliated. Such a spy under his own watch for such a long time and he did not know. Moreover, he directly set up one mission after another and sent the lives of his martial brothers into the enemies\u2019 traps. He even sent his most valued disciple.If Chu Yang did not uncover this guy today, then who knew how many more times would Cheng Zi Ang keep falling into the enemies\u2019 traps.Everyone looked at Chu Yang in a different light. This newly appointed Adjunct Minister was really not simple. He only took this position for one day and he already caught a spy. This was tantamount to saving some of their lives. Who knew who would be the next one to die on a mission? It could have been any one of them. With a spy like this, anyone would have died.\u201cWait.\u201d Chu Yang shouted.\u201cWhat orders do you have, Minister Chu?\u201d Cheng Zi Ang\u2019s attitude toward Chu Yang had completely changed at this point. He committed a serious dereliction of duty and Chu Yang had helped him correct it. Even though he was a youth with low cultivation, he had keen observation and superior wisdom; the others could not help but respect him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why would they leave their own name and give you a clue to investigate with? It might just lead to a bunch of powerful enemies. We must be careful in this matter.\u201d\u201cThe Minister is right.\u201d Cheng Zi Ang\u2019s face seemed frightened as he said gravely.Towards this young Minister, his admiration was increasing.Deputy Pavilion Lord Chen Yu Tong also agreed with Chu Yang\u2019s insight and became pensive.\u201cWe first need to investigate based on appearance, cultivation level, and special characteristics of the body. From there, we could verify his true identity. We cannot believe in anything he said.\u201d\u201cThe second step: while the name Liu Xiao Cheng might not be credible, one person will surely know. It is the Ranger, Ping Wu Ying, from Clear Spring prefecture. This person must be captured.\u201d\u201cAt the time Liu Xiao Cheng joined Bu Tian Pavilion, we investigated him through Ping Wu Ying. Ping Wu Ying verified Liu Xiao Cheng\u2019s identity. In other words, Ping Wu Ying was involved in this. He was not the mastermind, but he is definitely an enemy. We absolutely cannot spare Ping Wu Ying and his family.\u201cYes.\u201d Chen Yu Tong said, \u201cI will arrange it immediately, and bring Ping Wu Ying back for questioning.\u201d\u201cNo need, just kill him with one slash and be done with it. Questioning will not bring us any results.\u201d Chu Yang said firmly, \u201cSecrets between two countries, the position of someone like Ping Wu Ying is not high enough to know anything. Most likely they would have already severed ties with him by the time we catch him. We don\u2019t have such an advantage.\u201d\u201cWe should at least try; we might just be able to catch a big fish.\u201d Cheng Zi Ang insisted. He had made such a grievous mistake before, so he was trying to make up for it. And Ping Wu Ying was the closest opportunity; he could not just let that go.\u201cUp to you.\u201d Chu Yang said casually, \u201cThere is another connection, the Sun Clan. They gave this person a background. In other words, the Sun Clan is also another force involved in this conspiracy.\u201dChu Yang\u2019s cold eyes slowly looked over everyone as he said lightly, \u201cThriving South\u2019s Sun Clan, kill them all.\u201dWhoever his gaze fell upon, felt as if they were being eyed by a poisonous snake; their whole body felt a sudden chill. As those three words came out of Chu Yang\u2019s mouth, a killing aura followed it and spread in all four directions, making everyone tremble.\u201cI will have to bother Official Cheng with this.\u201d Chu Yang looked in Cheng Zi Ang\u2019s direction, and slightly nodded as he said politely.Even though Chu Yang\u2019s voice was polite, this was an order. This was Chu Yang\u2019s first action after his investigation. If he wanted to have total control of Bu Tian Pavilion, Cheng Zi Ang\u2019s attitude was the most important.On Cheng Zi Ang\u2019s face there appeared a conflicted look; after his countenance changed a few times, he slowly said, \u201cYes, I shall carry it out.\u201dChu Yang smiled with satisfaction and said, \u201cAs for any invasion routes discovered by this spy, we will toss them out from now on. They can no longer be used.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 can we use these routes to plan against the enemies and salvage some of our dignity back?\u201d Chen Yu Tong mused and asked.\u201cNo, we have no way of knowing whether there are still spies left. Just one would be enough for the information about today\u2019s purge to be leaked out. Then the enemies could also use these routes to plan against us. This would be a road of death.\u201d Chu Yang\u2019s gaze changed. It seemed this Chen Yu Tong had some brains, only he was still too inexperienced and green.\u201cYes, the Minister is right.\u201d The sweat on Chen Yu Tong\u2019s forehead poured out like rain. He certainly did not consider that possibility.Chu Yang picked up the second file, his eyes swept over them as he slowly asked, \u201cWho here is Meng You De?\u201dBelow, in the third row, a bearded man suddenly turned pale.Everyone around him immediately turned around and looked at him, their eyes showing a guarded air.Chu Yang\u2019s clear gaze was on Meng You De. He quietly asked, \u201cMeng You De, do you want to kill yourself now or after I expose you?\u201dThe beard on Meng You De\u2019s face trembled, then he suddenly snapped, \u201cB*, don\u2019t think that just because you got to go on the prince\u2019s carriage and got a few praises from him that you are truly the Minister. My whole life, I have never done anything to be ashamed of. Bu Tian Pavilion had dozens of missions; all the successful ones, where we came back alive, included me. I am completely dedicated and put my life on the line for Iron Cloud. But today, a little b* like you dare to call me a spy?\u201dAfter he said this everyone immediately re-evaluated everything. It was true that in all the assassination missions, only Meng You De\u2019s squadron was able to successfully complete theirs; the other six squadrons were all annihilated. Moreover, Cheng Zi Ang and Chen Yu Tong also had a celebration in honor of Meng You De and promoted him from squadron leader to captain.How could he be a spy?Cheng Zi Ang frowned and looked at Chu Yang. Meng You De was a good fighter that he wanted to promote. If he was really a spy then Cheng Zi Ang might as well toss out his dignity.Chu Yang looked at Meng You De calmly, \u201cThose assassination attempts, four other squadrons went southeast and continually failed. Only you, Meng You De, went southeast and succeeded. And your strategy was based on information from Liu Xiao Cheng. Furthermore, your mission was carried out in the territory of Thriving South\u2019s Sun clan. Yet somehow you managed to not only succeed, but also came back safely without a scratch. So I ask you, what happened to the others? Why did your squadron come back alive time and time again?\u201d\u201cThe other four squadrons\u2019 cultivation levels were not lower than yours; they had more manpower and their targets were actually weaker than yours. And yet, in the end, they all failed while you came back in victory. Perhaps Liu Xiao Cheng only knew the plans of the four other squadrons but not yours? How could this be? If I am not mistaken, he and you were both on the second squadron and the plans were completely in the hands of the second squadron. So in other word, Liu Xiao Cheng definitely knew your plans.\u201dBefore being able to verify the true identity of that person, Chu Yang could only refer to him as \u201cLiu Xiao Cheng.\u201dChu Yang gave Meng You De an icy look, \u201cIs your luck that good?\u201dCheng Zi Ang sighed, his face pale. In this respect, Meng You De was looking really suspicious.\u201cIs my superior skill not enough?\u201d Meng You De looked full of anguish, but behind that fa\u00e7ade, there was a flash of panic.\u201cNo.\u201d Chu Yang slowly shook his head and stated with certainty, \u201cYou are a spy.\u201d\u201cIf you are accusing me of being a spy, then bring out your evidence.\u201d Meng You De roared.\u201cWe might be part of Iron Cloud\u2019s royal court, but this is not the justice department.\u201d Chu Yang said coolly, \u201cI only need to suspect you, then it would be enough for me to kill you. What evidence would I need? People, grab him.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe moment the order was given, two men immediately jumped up and headed toward Meng You De. One of them was Cheng Zi Ang.Cheng Zi Ang was really furious; he did not expect that when Chu Yang gave the order so many subordinates below actually started to move. This was essentially the official recognition of Chu Yang\u2019s authority over them. This symbolized the solidification of Chu Yang\u2019s authority over Bu Tian Pavilion.Cheng Zi Ang\u2019s face was as red as a liver. His anger was about to burst out from under his skin.If Meng You De was a spy, then the spies essentially saw him as an idiot. Moreover, with more than one spy in his organization, and he, himself, helped promote one of them. He was, in essence, one of their confidants.What kind of mockery was this?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Don\u2019t tell me you guys are believing this? Because of a little b* that just arrived, you are ready to cut down a meritorious brother like this?\u201d\u201cMeng You De, if you are not a spy then we will surely give you back your good name. Why are you being so scared like that?\u201d Chu Yang said coldly.Meng You De was surprised, then he suddenly laughed out loud, \u201cIf Tie Bu Tian already gave power to a little b* like you, then is this a place for me anymore? I don\u2019t need to answer any questions; I will bid you all farewell!\u201dRight after he finished, he immediately shot toward the window as fast as a flying meteor.However, there was someone even faster than him. In a flash, Deputy Pavilion Lord Chen Yu Tong appeared by the window.\u201cBam\u2026\u201dThe two people palmed each other. Chen Yu Tong shook violently after that one move. His face turned dark; he yelled angrily, \u201cYour cultivation level is clearly Great Martial Master; why did you pretend to be a Martial Master?\u201dHe thought that his opponent was a Martial Master so he only used a quarter of his martial power. He did not expect the opponent\u2019s strength to be so powerful; he did not have time to activate more energy and almost suffered a major injury.Chen Yu Tong\u2019s words made the atmosphere even grimmer.Just the cover up of his cultivation alone was already very suspicious.Meng You De fell to the ground, and took a few staggered steps before stabilizing himself. He laughed mockingly, \u201cThat\u2019s enough. If you don\u2019t believe me then let me just die! My own martial brothers don\u2019t trust me; what else is there to make this life worth living?\u201dAfter he finished, he raised his palm above his head and started to slam down, his face was filled with frustration.\u201cElder Brother Meng, wait a minute!\u201d A big man stepped up, reached out and grabbed Meng You De\u2019s wrist. He said hastily, \u201cSomeday, everything will be clear. Why must you put down your own life like this?\u201d\u201cShiiing\u2026\u201dBefore the man was done speaking, Meng You De\u2019s face turned devious. The hand that was aiming at his own head now turned and grabbed the other man\u2019s wrist tightly. At the same time, his right arm reached down toward his waist and only a bright flash was seen before his long sword was on the man\u2019s throat.\u201cLet me leave!\u201d Meng You De grinned, \u201cOtherwise, this guy will die with me!\u201d\u201cYou would rather threaten the life of a hostage than explain yourself. If you\u2019re not a spy, then what are you?\u201d Chu Yang looked at him from a distance and used a strange, unseen force as he slowly spoke, \u201cMeng You De, even though you are a spy, I really admire you. The process Great Zhao uses to choose talents is truly impeccable. I don\u2019t even know how they managed to find such powerful people like you guys!\u201dMeng You De sneered. With his hand holding a sword, his eyes looked around as he slowly moved toward the door. His mouth unconsciously answered, \u201cUnder Minister Diwu, no one is afraid of death!\u201dAfter those words came out of his mouth, his face suddenly became pale.In the great hall, everyone immediately let out an angry hmm. These words were his own admission of his true identity!\u201cYou really are a spy!\u201d Cheng Zi Ang was so angry he almost vomited blood. The feeling of shame rose right to his head. At that moment, he felt extremely depressed; he only wanted to kill himself to pay for his errors!Chen Yu Tong looked at Chu Yang with surprise. This Meng You De had a really fortified mind. Even in great struggles and hopelessness, he was still a formidable person. Such a person was normally tight-lipped; why did he reveal his flaws after a few words from Chu Yang?Chu Yang\u2019s face seemed nonchalant, but inside, he was sneering. He secretly used Deep Spirit Principle with the words he said earlier. Moreover, he used all of his mental strength to speak, and these words came out at a key moment. When Meng You De had just relaxed his mind, Chu Yang\u2019s question along with this hypnotic method powerfully fell upon him. Meng You De was too busy looking around him for any movements to notice Chu Yang\u2019s mental attack, and just conveniently answered his question.A sentence he could never be redeemed from.\u201cNo worries, they\u2019re both on the same side. Kill them!\u201d Chu Yang said coldly as he looked at Meng You De pulling the other man toward the door, \u201cHe took that guy as a hostage instead of anyone else. Just earlier, the two were against each other. But suddenly, that guy jumped up for him to take hostage; and so easily, too! Who would be fooled by such a cat and mouse game? Kill them all.\u201dThese words barely came out of Chu Yang\u2019s mouth, yet they gave everyone another shock. Even Meng You De and that man were not any less shocked. Suddenly, the two roared out loud and separated from each other. With their weapons out, they tried to break out!Such actions further verified Chu Yang\u2019s speculation. All the doubtful minds immediately understood. No wonder that man acted so strangely. No wonder Meng You De captured a hostage so easily. No wonder\u2026Chu Yang\u2019s words had forced the two to take desperate actions. In their head, Chu Yang\u2019s words rang clearly: \u201cI only need to suspect you, then it would be enough for me to kill you. What evidence would I need?\u201dThis made the two think: Death is death. It is better to risk it with a fight. Even if we die, news would be sent back and our families would be safe.Besides, we might not die!They were already at the door, another ten feet then they would escape. This might not have necessarily meant survival, but it was still safer than this enclosed great hall. The two felt like success was in their grasp. They were so happy when Chu Yang unexpectedly revealed their tactic.However, there was not that great of a distance left. Taking a desperate rush might not end up being so bad for them. Once they were out of here and in the midst of Iron Cloud Citadel, they would surely find help.Cheng Zi Ang angrily roared. A bright saber suddenly flashed in the great hall.That saber just flashed, there was immediately two screams. There were two dead people chopped into four parts at the door. Blood spilled on the ground. Cheng Zi Ang with his saber in hand, stood like a statue at the door with his back against everyone.He killed the two spies with one swing of his saber!\u201cMinister, I\u2026 have done wrong!\u201d Cheng Zi Ang turned toward Chu Yang\u2019s direction and kneeled with his head down as he spoke with great difficulty.Cheng Zi Ang felt extremely shameful. Earlier, he was almost fooled again. If Meng You De did not use his fellow spy to escape, then he would still be here to continue causing damage to Bu Tian Pavilion.What was most intolerable was the fact that he almost got fooled again. If Chu Yang was not here, then he surely would have believed what he had seen.There are so many spies in my ranks, and yet I am still a na\u00efve idiot. So na\u00efve that I could have been fooled so easily. I don\u2019t have any dignity left to live. How can I take on the responsibilities of a Pavilion Lord of Bu Tian Pavilion?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDon\u2019t be in such a rush to confess. This is not over yet.\u201d Chu Yang glared at him coldly, then looked at the documents in his hand and randomly pulled out one file. He said nonchalantly, \u201cWho is Feng Cheng Zhi? Step out. Suicide or be killed, choose one.\u201d(walkthejianghu.com)After this cleansing, Cheng Zi Ang and Chen Yu Tong only wanted to crawl down a hole and die. In the group of eighty-seven, Chu Yang managed to pull out nine spies!With each one, he had evidence. If not actual evidence, then Chu Yang would use some psychological methods for them to show their tails.The most incredible one was number nine. Chu Yang did not even call his name yet. He only shifted his gaze toward that guy, and he immediately looked around and stepped out of his ranks.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I am a spy and I only knew the identity of one of those spies; you managed to find them all. What\u2019s most admirable is that you did this by only looking through documents. This power of insight alone is worthy of my respect!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Chu Yang closed the documents and waved his hand as he looked at this person.This time, Chu Yang did not need to say anything. Chen Yu Tong automatically took the documents from Chu Yang\u2019s hand. Only a single day had passed, but Chu Yang had managed to establish absolute authority. Notwithstanding anything else, the existence of these spies meant that Bu Tian Pavilion could have fallen at any time. Moreover, as long as they did not show any big flaws, they could have continued to spy indefinitely!What Chu Yang did was equivalent to saving their lives, more than once!Forget about how young Chu Yang was. Forget about what his cultivation level was. His insight alone was unmatched in this world!Chu Yang did not bother to move a finger. He also did not have to show his cultivation. His keen insight was enough to conquer these stubborn people of Bu Tian Pavilion.\u201cYou are also a spy? You\u2019re admitting it on your own? Good, you saved me the trouble!\u201d Chu Yang smiled, \u201cCould it be that you have something to tell me?\u201dThat person smiled and said, \u201cYou did not ask those before me. Now that I have stood up on my own, you definitely should not ask.\u201dChu Yang nodded in agreement. Witnessing his calmness when he identified himself, Chu Yang had long since given up any hope of him talking. This man was clearly ready to die since he was so calm.Chu Yang gently tapped his finger on the tabletop, \u201cI understand. Most of you people are faithful to Diwu Qing Rou; the rest are controlled with the lives of their family members. Currently, we do not have the power to save them, and we especially are in no condition to recruit you; so I won\u2019t ask. You may go ahead and kill yourself if you want.\u201d\u201cBu Tian Pavilion has indeed found a good leader. Minister Chu\u2019s intelligence, cunning, and insight are little different from the legendary Official Diwu. I actually wanted to see you two fight, to see who will win in the end. It\u2019s a pity that this is no longer possible!\u201d That person smiled as black blood slowly ran down the side of his mouth. He had bitten the poison sac in his mouth.\u201cIn fact, we also have never seen Diwu Qing Rou\u2026\u201d That person looked at Chu Yang with blank eyes. His body remained erect like that but his breathing had stopped. It was not until a long while after that it fell down.His last words were filled with hidden meanings.The entire great hall was flooded with the smell of fresh blood. The atmosphere was so quiet it was suffocating!Cheng Zi Ang\u2019s people were stunned. All those spies, and none of them turned. While some of them were captured and killed, most of them committed suicide.What sort of methods were used to train a group of people like that? Especially that last one, even when he was dying, he was calm and smiling.As Chu Yang looked at the bodies on the ground, his countenance was grim. How many more of such people did Diwu Qing Rou still have in his hands? He suddenly felt that this Diwu Qing Rou had become a giant mountain in his path.He already knew that Diwu Qing Rou was incredibly powerful, but after what had happened today, Chu Yang was forced to place Diwu Qing Rou at an even higher level!An unprecedented rival!Chu Yang smiled faintly and gathered his thoughts. Looking at the remaining people, he said, \u201cThose who are still here, there is\u2026 ahhhh\u2026 The evidence I have currently is still too inadequate, so we will temporarily stop here. In any case, there will not be any missions in the near future. I hope all the remaining spies will quickly leave Bu Tian Pavilion on their own. As for those who are currently in contact with Diwu Qing Rou\u2019s people, but are still on the fence, I hope that you will quickly make a final decision!\u201dHe paused a little, then slowly continued, \u201cBu Tian Pavilion was just founded not too long ago. The reason you people had come here is to, first, use your efforts to make your own fortune, and second, help your families live a good life. However, spying\u2026 haha\u2026 This is not exactly a good thing. If you leave on your own, I will not pursue any further! Anyone who comes to me on their own, not only will they not be punished, they would be rewarded! I solemnly guarantee it! Besides not pursuing it further, I will also help those people keep their secret!\u201dAt this point, his gaze swept over the dozens of people below. One by one, as his gaze fell upon them, they felt as if they were being watched by a poisonous snake!An icy chill rose right to their heads.\u201cI only have from now until midnight.\u201d Chu Yang said coldly, \u201cFrom the Pavilion Lord and downward, two people every quarter of an hour; everyone will have to come in for a chat with me. By dawn tomorrow, those who are still on the fence will be killed. Absolutely no mercy!\u201d\u201cPavilion Lords, do you have anything to add?\u201d Chu Yang turned and asked.His question was simply a false courtesy to appease the two. He did not expect Cheng Zi Ang and Chen Yu Tong to immediately step forward and answer, \u201cWhatever the minister decides, we will absolutely follow!\u201dChu Yang smiled with satisfaction, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, let\u2019s start. I will be waiting inside.\u201dWith that, he casually stood up and walked away.After Chu Yang left, everyone simultaneously stood up with all eyes on his back.\u201cThis Minister is really powerful!\u201d someone whispered.\u201cTrue, this insight and this intelligence are really indescribable. I have not done anything against my conscience, but when he looked at me, I felt guilty.\u201d\u201cYes! Yes! I also had that feeling.\u201d\u201cWhat is his cultivation level?\u201d one person wondered.\u201cForget it. Don\u2019t try to poke into things you don\u2019t understand! With just his intelligence alone, would it matter if the Minister did not know any martial arts? Do you not see Diwu Qing Rou?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201d\u201cHaving said that, it seems that the Minister does not even know a little bit of martial arts. His appearance seems gallant, but also a little weak. I am sure he will grow to be handsome. Such a weak physique, but one glance was enough to send chills over the whole body!\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d (walkthejianghu.com)Everyone was still talking when Cheng Zi Ang stood up and walked toward the room Chu Yang just went in. Behind him, a discussion rose up, \u201cYou guys try to guess. After this purge, how many people will remain?\u201d\u201cWho knows. With nine dead\u2026 Mother*! Those nine guys lived in the same place as us every day, and yet I did not notice anything.\u201d\u201cAhhh\u2026 Honestly speaking, this minister saved our lives.

After hearing you say that, a chill ran down my back!\u201dAfter a short while, Cheng Zi Ang came out from the room, his gaze shifted back and forth. Chen Yu Tong sighed and went in.\u201cLook, it seems that the two Pavilion Lords have yielded. Since the founding of Bu Tian Pavilion until now, besides Prince Bu Tian, they have not yielded to anyone. This minister is really not a simple person\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you kidding? Currently, the whole world is fighting for power. An individual\u2019s strength can only rule one region, but superior intelligence can rule the world. How could these two things even be compared?

Even while he was in the room, Chu Yang still attentively paid attention to what was going on outside. Even after everyone went back out, he did not stop paying attention. Yet, he did not discover anything else.Perhaps there were no more. Or perhaps they were extremely crafty and did not reveal any flaws. Chu Yang himself did not have much hope; he only wanted to go through every member of the pavilion.By the time everyone came back out, it was almost midnight. Those who already went in came out quietly and waited in the great hall. They did not dare to make noise or complain about being hungry; they just waited in silence.Finally, Chu Yang also came out. His face was so grim, it disturbed everyone. It seemed\u2026 was something not right? Perhaps there were too many spies?Under everyone\u2019s watchful eyes, Chu Yang finally spoke, \u201cI am very sad!\u201dHe frowned and said with a sigh, \u201cI thought since you are all people of Iron Cloud, you would love your country passionately. At the battlefield, two million eight hundred thousand brothers became spirits, and yet I can\u2019t believe\u2026 yet\u2026\u201dSilence in all four directions, it seemed there were really still spies left within their midst!\u201cIf the spies are people of Great Zhao, then that can\u2019t be helped! Because that is their country, their home. But you people are Iron Cloud people! Yet, because a few taels of silver, because of some empty promises, you would hand over six hundred million of your own people over to others. To let them trample\u2026 to let them abuse\u2026 Are you people still human beings?\u201dChu Yang seemed really agitated; his face was completely red.More than seventy experts of Martial Master and Martial Great Master levels stood muted below.\u201cI will remind you once more. If a person from Great Zhao committed these offenses, I will kill only that person. However, if it is an Iron Cloud person, I will kill nine generations of his family!\u201dChu Yang sternly asked, \u201cDo you think I should do that?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe people below replied in unison.\u201cPerhaps, their names should be written down in history, so they can suffer the ridicules of many generations as well!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you correct your mistakes now, I will not investigate further. I hope everyone will learn from this! Today, I will let bygones be bygones, but you should keep in mind, the chance you are given today is once in a lifetime!\u201d Chu Yang spoke these words with an extremely solemn air.The people below, even if they never committed any betrayals, felt guilty upon hearing these words. Two million eight hundred thousand souls laid down in the battlefield? I have not done anything worth mentioning yet. Moreover, from the minister\u2019s words, it seems there are still spies in our midst? As well as people who are wavering?This was infuriating to everyone!\u201cI will now announce a new partitioning of power for Bu Tian Pavilion. From now on Bu Tian Pavilion will divide in to three brigades. The first is Iron Blood Brigade, directly supervised by me. This brigade will be in charge of punishments!\u201d\u201cIron Blood, the blood of Iron Cloud, must have unquestionable loyalty!\u201d Chu Yang\u2019s eyes, full of prestige and radiance, swept the room as he spoke, \u201cEverything in this world has rules! If the rules are not strict, there will be flaws. Once there are flaws then there will be loss. And this loss will be human lives! Our Bu Tian Pavilion does not deal in selling and buying, but in killing. I am sure everyone understands this very well! Therefore, everyone in this organization must obey Iron Blood Brigade unconditionally!\u201d\u201cYes, as the Minister commands! Creating Iron Blood Brigade for Bu Tian Pavilion is something that must be done!\u201dChu Yang nodded. By talking about this first, he had brought the entire Bu Tian Pavilion into one singular unit. Unconditional obedience, this was not simple at all.\u201cThe second is Fierce Blood Brigade, Iron Cloud\u2019s hot-bloodedness. At any time this brigade must be ready to take on dangerous missions; it is Bu Tian Pavilion\u2019s fist! This brigade is Bu Tian Pavilion\u2019s most important source of strength!\u201dChu Yang\u2019s eyes was filled with trust as he looked at Cheng Zi Ang and said sincerely, \u201cI think, with this great burden, no one is better suited than Official Cheng!\u201dCheng Zi Ang was caught by surprise; he took one step forward and, with one hand holding the other fist, he said, \u201cAs the Minister commands!\u201dOf course, Cheng Zi Ang knew Chu Yang\u2019s intentions very well. Chu Yang wanted to hold all of Bu Tian Pavilion\u2019s power in his hands. If Chang Zi Ang took on the position of the second brigade\u2019s leader, then that was no different than him leaving his Pavilion Lord position.From now on, Bu Tian Pavilion would not have a Pavilion Lord, only one Minister!Today, Chu Yang not only established his authority, but also suppressed the prestige of the two Pavilion Lords down to nothing. Currently, if the two of them stubbornly maintained their Pavilion Lord positions, they would just end up with a name without any substance. Moreover, the two of them had made such a big blunder; they did not have the face to sit in that position anymore! (TLN: It\u2019s been a while since we got some face!)At this time, when they felt guilty and depressed, Chu Yang made this request that hit right in their weak spot. If they protested, the rest of the pavilion members would have probably jeered them.Therefore, this brigade leader position, Cheng Zi Ang had to take it even if he did not want it. Currently, Chu Yang\u2019s authority was as powerful as the mid-day sun. Cheng Zi Ang no longer had any options!Chu Yang smiled happily and said, \u201cOfficial Cheng is extremely skilled, a top level expert under the heavens; I am extremely assured!\u201d\u201cThank you for Minister Chu\u2019s praises!\u201d Cheng Zi Ang smiled forcefully, and thought to himself: This guy got rid of my position with barely any effort. He took all my power, lowered my position and destroyed my fame. And yet, I have to thank him. Mother*, life is really strange!\u201cThe third brigade is \u2026\u201d Chu Yang pondered a little. He raised his eyebrow and said decisively, \u201cThe third will be called Heavenly Secret Brigade. All of Bu Tian Pavilion\u2019s information shall be handed to them. This is the bloodline of Bu Tian Pavilion. If the information has even the smallest of errors, the price would be none other than our blood! Therefore\u2026\u201dHeavenly Secret (TLN: Tian Ji, a mystery only known to heaven) was the name of Mo Tian Ji! Master of Calculation and Manipulation, Mo Tian Ji was the person who orchestrated Chu Yang\u2019s demise in the past life. He intentionally named Bu Tian Pavilion\u2019s intelligence unit Heavenly Secret Brigade to remind himself every minute, every second that there was still a powerful enemy ahead of him. If he slacked off just a little, in the hands of Mo Tian Ji, he would reach a hopeless end!How terrifying Mo Tian Ji was, no one knew better than Chu Yang.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMinister Chu, I volunteer to be the leader of the third brigade. I promise to share some of the hardship with Prince Bu Tian and Minister Chu!\u201d Chen Yu Tong did not wait for Chu Yang to finish before stepping up and volunteering to take on this position.Cheng Zi Ang had to give in, then why would I bother to protest? I might as well concede\u2026 As long I can have a stable foothold in Bu Tian Pavilion in the future.Minister Chu was brought in by Prince Bu Tian, himself. Handpicked amongst all of Iron Cloud Nation! What can I gain by going against him? Chen Yu Tong thought to himself.\u201cThank you Brigade Leader Chen. Haha, and I was worried that Heavenly Secret Brigade would not have an experienced and resourceful leader. Official Chen volunteered to take on this responsibility; I am pleasantly surprised!\u201d Chu Yang said happily.Pleasantly surprised, my butt! If I didn\u2019t volunteer, you would still throw it in my face. Cheng Zi Ang\u2019s lesson is still fresh. I am not that stupid! Chen Yu Tong thought inwardly, but his face was all smiles, \u201cWe are Iron Cloud\u2019s people. If we could help contribute to our nation, then that is already a lifetime\u2019s privilege for us fighters!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Official Chen is truly a good man.\u201d Chu Yang praised happily.Then suddenly he seemed to have realized something, then said sincerely, \u201cOfficial Chen, Heavenly Secret Brigade is something that has to be carefully handled. Every piece of information must be verified because I want us to be one hundred percent sure. Then I could send the brothers from Fierce Blood to complete their missions. If on the small chance that\u2026 Well, the responsibility of Heavenly Secret Brigade would not be small. Official Chen, all these lives in Bu Tian Pavilion are placed in your hands. The great responsibility that you have shouldered is not light at all.\u201dChen Yu Tong almost choked with anger.This guy talked like a righteous person, but in truth, he was clearly just seizing power! Complete certainty! Who can be so certain about anything like he wanted? Forget about sneaking into the enemy\u2019s lines and assassinating their general; even if you just got married, there would still be a chance of impotence when the night comes.\u201cOnce we have information, this brigade leader will immediately discuss it with Minister Chu. Then we can analyze the bad and the good carefully. Finally, we can come up with the perfect plan together.\u201d Chen Yu Tong suppressed his anger and continued, \u201cAt that time, I hope Minister Chu can put aside some time out of his busy schedule to deal with such urgent matters, and join in the intel work of Heavenly Secret Brigade for the safety of all the martial bothers.\u201dChen Yu Tong had lost his Deputy Pavilion Lord position in a painful way. These words of his were the same as to him handing his intelligence leader position over as well. At this point, he was just an intelligence gathering machine, without any decision-making capability.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Chu Yang made a show of facing a tough decision and said, \u201cOfficial Chen does not need to do that. I only said so without any other hidden meanings. Besides, I am in charge of both Iron Blood and overseeing the whole operation. Everything will keep me very busy; I am afraid I won\u2019t have time\u2026\u201d\u201cI hope the Minister will carefully reconsider for the sake of the greater good, and all the martial brothers!\u201d Chen Yu Tong\u2019s mouth was saying this while his heart was cursing this shameless Chu Yang\u2019s eight generations of ancestors. You clearly forced me to hand my rights over, but, now, you are putting up your false pretense.\u201cAhhh\u2026\u201d Chu Yang sighed and spoke with great reservation, \u201cIf that is the case\u2026 Ok, ok! I shall take a chance with these old bones, then.\u201dBelow, a number of people pursed their lips.\u201cThen I officially announce that we now have three leaders for the brigades!\u201d Chu Yang dealt with the two Pavilion Lords without pulling out his blade. Now that all the power was completely in his hands, he could not help but feel exhilarated.Next, Chu Yang took the opportunity to hand out assignments as if he had lived with these people for decades. Who was good at what, who was bad at what, who was best suited for what brigade so they can show their full potentials\u2026 Everything was arranged in their rightful place. There was nothing that was not clear and orderly.Everyone was given the position most suited to them! The three brigades in the great hall were just formed, and they immediately divided clear responsibilities. One could imagine how such divisions could make their strength increase tremendously compared to what they were before, when everyone were just tossed in one pile.Cheng Zi Ang and Chen Yu Tong were currently critical of Chu Yang, but they could not help admiring his arrangements.Without wasting one ounce of strength, Chu Yang completely controlled Bu Tian Pavilion!Chu Yang looked at Heavenly Secret Brigade, and immediately thought of Gu Du Xing. How are things progressing on his end?*******Within the Prince\u2019s manor.Tie Bu Tian frowned as he looked at the two people in front of him, \u201cWait a moment.\u201dSitting opposite of him was two officials dressed in court attire; their faces looked worried. The two of them came here because of the incident of Gu Du Xing taking over Emerald Flow Lake. After all, Gu Du Xing was essentially throwing names and said that it was Tie Bu Tian\u2019s order. With the prince\u2019s name, the officials did not dare to do anything rash, and came here for a consultation.They did not expect when they came here in the late afternoon that it would be midnight and Prince Tie Bu Tian\u2019s attitude was still ambiguous. He did not say they could leave, but he also did not say they were not allowed to leave. He only kept saying one phrase: Wait a moment.Wait a moment more\u2026 It has been a few dozen times since Tie Bu Tian said \u201cWait a moment more,\u201d making the two unable to leave. They had to sit like that for a long time. Every time the two people tried to talk, the prince would only say, \u201cWait a moment.\u201dThese two pitiful men sat so long that they became antsy. They did not even dare to go to the bathroom. Their stomachs made sorry gurgling noises.Finally, there was an announcement at the door, \u201cYour Highness, Official Cheng asked to see you!\u201d\u201cSend him into the side hall.\u201dThen Tie Bu Tian slowly stood up, and turned to the two people, \u201cPlease wait a moment. I will be back shortly.\u201dThe two officials quickly nodded. They smiled and said, \u201cYour Highness is busy, please feel free to go.\u201dTie Bu Tian nodded and walked out.*********Side hall.Cheng Zi Ang was pacing back and forth. After performing his ceremonious greeting with Tie Bu Tian, he seemed to want to say something but hesitated.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Tie Bu Tian asked quietly.\u201c\u2026 Your Highness has a keen eye for people!\u201d Cheng Zi Ang finally managed to squeeze out one sentence after half a day of suppression, \u201cBu Tian Pavilion is right now under his sole command!\u201d\u201cWhat? Did he use force to control everyone?\u201d\u201cIt is not the case. He managed to dig out nine spies from within Bu Tian Pavilion! From beginning to end, he only used the fa\u00e7ade of a weak scholar to take care of everything. Finally, he took away Chen Yu Tong\u2019s and my power.\u201d Cheng Zi Ang sighed, looking ashamed.\u201cWhat?\u201d Tie Bu Tian was a bit shock, and murmured, \u201cSo fast?\u201d\u201cYes. Moreover, all the martial brothers at the pavilion respect him completely!\u201d\u201cRespect\u2026\u201d Tie Bu Tian stood up and walked a few steps back and forth. Of course, he had faith that Chu Yang was capable of controlling Bu Tian Pavilion. What he did not expect was that it would be so fast. Plus, he never bothered to use force to achieve his goals.This made him see Chu Yang\u2019s abilities in a whole new light.After contemplating for a moment, he said, \u201cYou may go.\u201dLooking at Cheng Zi Ang leaving, Tie Bu Tian faced the heavens, quietly thought and muttered, \u201cIf he has such capabilities, then I have to give him Emerald Flow Lake. What\u2019s there to hesitate about? Without trust, the person can\u2019t be used; if the person is used, there should be no suspicions.\u201dIt was true that Chu Yang had an existing agreement with Tie Bu Tian, but that was for part of Emerald Flow Lake only. However, Gu Du Xing currently played a big game, and took over all of Emerald Flow Lake. The area he took over was much larger than what was agreed upon\u2026Even though this was outside of his original expectations, Tie Bu Tian patiently waited. He was waiting, waiting to see if Chu Yang could control Bu Tian Pavilion\u2026 That was all.If he did not have the ability to control, then he would not get anything. However, Chu Yang had now demonstrated abilities surpassing everyone else. Even if he asked for the whole world, Tie Bu Tian would acquiesce if he could!********The two officials in the great hall exchanged gazes. They had a bad feeling, as if the prince had already made some promise with Emerald Flow Lake. But\u2026 if that was the case, the Prince only needed to say so and this whole thing would be buried. Why did he hesitate like this?\u201cI have made you two wait long.\u201d Tie Bu Tian slowly walked forward, smiling as he spoke, \u201cWith so much work, it could not be helped. Please forgive me.\u201dThe two hurriedly said they did not dare.\u201cAh, you were talking about Emerald Flow Lake, correct?\u201d Tie Bu Tian rubbed his brows, and said sadly, \u201cMy memory is not that good.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s about that Emerald Flow Lake. We wanted to know if the Prince has any orders.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI heard that person\u2019s attitude was very bad?\u201d Tie Bu Tian frowned and asked with some displeasure.\u201cYour Highness, that young man had no reason! He isolated the entire Emerald Flow Lake and turned it into an off limits area. He made it into his personal property. Moreover, he announced that it was the Prince\u2019s idea. This commotion drove the people\u2019s anguish to the breaking point. If we don\u2019t intervene in time, it might cause a great upheaval in the citadel.\u201d In front of Tie Bu Tian was a middle-aged man with a big position in the royal court. Tie Bu Tian\u2019s less than happy attitude gave him the hint that the prince was not pleased with that person, so he immediately made a big deal out of it.\u201cThe people\u2019s anguish reached the breaking point? Might cause a great upheaval?\u201d Tie Bu Tian mouth\u2019s curved up, showing a mocking smile, \u201cOfficial Wang, you are the head scholar of the court. When I was little, I was also taught by you. From you, I learned many valuable ideas. But these words \u2018the people\u2019s anguish reached the breaking point\u2019 that just came out of your mouth disappointed me.\u201dOfficial Wang was momentarily stunned, \u201cThe prince\u2019s words, this lowly official does not understand.\u201d\u201cFive years ago, this Emerald Flow Lake became your family\u2019s property!\u201d Tie Bu Tian used a calm and peaceful voice, enough to lull people to sleep. He said lightly, \u201cOfficial Wang, your nephew is Wang Bao Ping. That year, he helped the son of You Xiang take over Emerald Flow Lake. Afterward, You Xiang was killed by Royal Uncle in the golden hall, and all his properties were confiscated. And the person in charge of confiscating that property was you, Official Wang!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 94 \u2013 DefeatedOfficial Wang suddenly paled. How could he not understand Tie Bu Tian\u2019s implications?\u201cYou Xiang\u2019s son was sentenced to be exiled as a soldier, but ended up dying a questionable death in prison. From then on, Emerald Flow Lake, while seemingly without an owner on the outside, was actually controlled by your Wang family.\u201dTie Bu Tian said casually, \u201cOfficial Wang, around Emerald Flow Lake, there are a total of a few dozen businesses. Um\u2026 there are sixty-eight altogether. Thirty-seven of those belongs to the Wang family. The truth is, the royal court had not investigate this because: First, in the chaos of war with external forces, we have been busy. Second, all three inspectors of the royal court have properties at Emerald Flow Lake. Although not too many, those thirty-one properties left over were somehow fairly divided amongst the three. Hahaha, the income from all these years were not little at all; they were quite impressive actually!\u201d\u201cThird, I was hoping that there would be a day when you realize your mistake and turn back. Because for building my Iron Cloud, it was not easy for you officials either. What we have today is partly from your efforts. There is also the support of the royal court, public relations, as well as all your merits. For the country and the people, you have made your contributions! Haha\u2026\u201dWithin Tie Bu Tian\u2019s voice there was a slight chilliness. The two officials trembled as sweat poured down their faces\u2026 They felt as if their heads were spinning.\u201cEmerald Flow Lake is a place where seven or eight of you officials have been sharing profits for a long time! Yet, now that the royal court wants to take it back for use, you dare come to me complaining about the people\u2019s anguish\u2026! Where are the anguished people? Could it be that the people\u2019s anguish is really your anguish?\u201d\u201cYou used the pretense of public opinion to put pressure on my decision!\u201d Tie Bu Tian\u2019s gaze became icy all of a sudden. He yelled coldly, \u201cWang Zhi! Do you think I am an easy target to pick on because I am young?\u201d\u201cPlop!\u201dThe two men trembled uncontrollably. Their legs became weak; unable to stand they kneeled flat on the ground.Tie Bu Tian continued, \u201cSo, officials, do I need your permission to make use of Emerald Flow Lake?\u201d\u201cWe do not dare!\u201d The two people banged their heads on the floor repeatedly. At this moment, they were filled with regrets. They could not believe that this Emerald Flow Lake incident was the prince\u2019s idea. Moreover, they could not believe that he was that determined!\u201cHmm! Emerald Flow Lake is property of the country, a beautiful scenic area in Iron Cloud Citadel\u2026 yet you people conspired to make your own profits. What a joke! You are officials of the royal court; you get paid by the royal court and yet\u2026 You truly disappoint me!\u201d Tie Bu Tian said hurtfully, \u201cNever mind! You are elder officials of the royal court; I don\u2019t want to pursue this any further. Official Wang, go and notify all the other houses that they have to contribute half of their earnings from Emerald Flow Lake these past years to the country\u2019s treasury. You may leave.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. Thank you for your generosity, your highness. The two bowed over and over again. Sweat were pouring as if they just bathed, as if they just took a tour past the gate of hell and managed to return.\u201cDo you think any of the houses need me to send my own books for comparison?\u201d As the two thankfully backed out, Tie Bu Tian seemingly muttered this phrase. It immediately startled them, and caused them to trip down the stairs in the most embarrassing manner.Looking at the two people leaving awkwardly, Tie Bu Tian\u2019s gaze remained cold. He had been waiting and waiting for news from Bu Tian Pavilion, news about Chu Yang, not words from these people.Now that he had verified Chu Yang\u2019s ability, Tie Bu Tian made his final decision. If he had not yet gotten the results, Tie Bu Tian would have kept those two waiting for another day\u2026\u201cBu Tian Pavilion is finally beginning to take shape.\u201d Tie Bu Tian looked up the moon suspended outside his window, and sighed. Since it was formed, Bu Tian Pavilion was just a useless name. It was nothing more than a diversion to distract the enemies. Even though Tie Bu Tian\u2019s title was only prince, he held the complete responsibilities of a country\u2019s ruler. How could he have had any time for Bu Tian Pavilion?This appearance of Chu Yang basically filled in that gap.\u201cShadow Lord, what do you think? How far will Chu Yang raise Bu Tian Pavilion?\u201d Tie Bu Tian seemed to be muttering to himself.The air in front of him became blurry and twisted mysteriously for a while. The atmosphere seemed to have been slightly contorted\u2026 and suddenly a ghostly shadow appeared. A dry and low voice spoke, \u201cYou really should not be asking me about this.\u201d\u201cI am not asking you. It\u2019s just\u2026 I want to meet you two for a little.\u201d Tie Bu Tian said lightly, \u201cI rely on you two the most, and yet I cannot see you\u2026 Umm, it has been a few days, so I wanted to talk with you that\u2019s all. Only when I am sure that you are next to me that I can sleep peacefully. Only then will I dare fall asleep\u2026 Haha\u2026\u201dThe eyes of that shadow seemed to be slightly touched. It said with a raspy voice, \u201cYour highness can rest assured, as long as the two of us are here, then no one in Lower Three Heavens can kill you.\u201dTie Bu Tian chuckled and nodded. He muttered, \u201cI am so tired\u2026\u201d After that he took two steps back and lay down on the bed. He whispered, \u201cTwo shadow lords, you should rest also.\u201dThe atmosphere changed and contorted for a while before the shadow completely disappeared in the darkness of the night.On the comfortable bed, Tie Bu Tian quickly became immersed in deep sleep. The appearance of the shadow seemed to have greatly reassured him. Even though Tie Bu Tian did not know what the shadow\u2019s cultivation was, he was clear on one thing: If it were not for these two shadows always staying next to him, Diwu Qing Rou would have picked off his head countless times already.********By the time Cheng Zi Ang came back from Tie Bu Tian\u2019s place it was almost morning. When he got the door of his room and was about to push it open, he suddenly became startled. He yelled in a low voice, \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d A cool voice answered. Then the candle in the room was immediately lit.\u201cSo it\u2019s the Minister.\u201d Cheng Zi Ang breathed a sigh of relief as he pushed the door and walked in. In the room, Chu Yang was haughtily sitting in the middle chair. His cold eyes looked at Cheng Zi Ang.\u201cDid the Minister visit my room this late in the night to teach me something?\u201d Cheng Zi Ang did not understand why his heart started to beat fast.He clearly felt that the opponent\u2019s strength was not equal to his. He only needed to raise his arm and he could send Chu Yang to his death\u2026 However, he did not understand why he felt reluctant and even scared when it came to this frail looking youth. To him, this was something that really could not be explained.\u201cI dare not.\u201d Chu Yang smiled and said, \u201cThis afternoon, my words were a little harsh. Plus, I did not notify Official Cheng ahead of time about the changes in positions so I felt a little uneasy.\u201d\u201cNo, no. Minister Chu is clever. With a flick of your hand, you found a bunch of traitors and helped Bu Tian Pavilion eliminate this quiet danger. Moreover, as fast as lightning, you organized all of Bu Tian Pavilion\u2019s strengths into the appropriate groups. I truly admire that.\u201d Cheng Zi Ang laughed.\u201cAh, so in that case, Official Cheng agreed with all of my actions, correct?\u201d Chu Yang smiled and asked.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOf course, of course. I fully support them.\u201d Cheng Zi Ang nodded repeatedly as he continued to contemplate Chu Yang\u2019s true motive in this visit. At this time, he felt a little apprehensive and a little unsettled.\u201cAh, the prince did not say anything right?\u201d Chu Yang smiled as he continued to ask.\u201cUh, he didn\u2019t say anything, he didn\u2019t say anything\u2026 ah!\u201d Half way through, Cheng Zi Ang suddenly became lucid. The words choked in his throat as he looked at Chu Yang in astonishment. His eyes looked as if he just saw a demon.\u201cIt\u2019s good that he did not say anything, ah\u2026\u201d Chu Yang stood up, and said with a slight nod, \u201cActually, I had hope that he would add something, hahaha\u2026 Official Cheng, you are of a great age and yet you have to work so hard\u2026 haha. You should rest soon.\u201d He stopped there, then pushed the door open and walked out arrogantly.Cheng Zi Ang\u2019s head was full of sweat; however, his whole body was cold.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He went to the prince\u2019s manor at top speed. After that, he relayed everything in the shortest amount of time possible, and returned at the fastest speed. The whole process did not even take fifteen minutes!And yet, Chu Yang already knew everything; he was waiting right there. Even if Tie Bu Tian secretly notified Chu Yang, he could not have been that fast!Cheng Zi Ang suddenly understood. The youth in front of him had a mind with a depth as deep as the sea. In front of him, no one could hide anything!Just now, he did not say anything, but he clearly came to find me.\u2018Your whereabouts are in the palm of my hand. For ten thousand times, you should not have any wrong ideas, or you will be sorry!\u2019This was his meaning.Looking at Chu Yang leaving, Cheng Zi Ang let out a deep sigh.Walking in the night wind, Chu Yang felt very refreshed. He had always paid attention to Cheng Zi Ang because he was sure that Cheng Zi Ang was Tie Bu Tian\u2019s representative at Bu Tian Pavilion.Cheng Zi Ang might have been a high level expert, but he was not a suitable leader! He could climb to the position of Pavilion Lord because, first, he was currently the most powerful one, and, second, he was trustworthy!Otherwise, Tie Bu Tian would not have let an outsider hold the pavilion lord position of Bu Tian Pavilion like that. Moreover, while Tie Bu Tian was the founder, he did not hold a single important responsibility. In fact, his leadership position was in name only and not even notable.This was because Tie Bu Tian trusted Cheng Zi Ang.Chu Yang absolutely believed that Tie Bu Tian would not have abandoned Bu Tian Pavilion just like that. That was why upon seeing Cheng Zi Ang disappear after everything ended, Chu Yang knew that he ran to report to Tie Bu Tian.After all, Bu Tian Pavilion underwent such a big change, he would have to immediately notify Tie Bu Tian!So Chu Yang immediately went into Cheng Zi Ang\u2019s room and waited.Having such a bad aftertaste did not feel too good. What Chu Yang wanted was total control of Bu Tian Pavilion, not having an informant by his side all the time. Having an unsettling feeling like that was not too good. However, getting rid of Cheng Zi Ang altogether was beyond Chu Yang\u2019s ability. So Chu Yang wanted to use this threat to put the maximum amount of pressure on Cheng Zi Ang!It\u2019s fine that you are the prince\u2019s person, but this is my territory! If you are a dragon, you will still have to curl up; if you are a tiger, you will still have to bow! Without my permission, don\u2019t you dare try to create any waves!Don\u2019t think that because you have the prince\u2019s trust, you can do whatever you want. As long as I am the boss of this place, it is my territory!Chu Yang went hmm, hmm, and let out a ferocious and hideous laugh. That terrifying voice was carried outside by the night wind\u2026 In a home next to the road, a baby had been crying; it immediately stopped and became completely silent\u2026After arriving at Emerald Flow Lake, Chu Yang, even with superhuman composure, was rendered dumbfounded by the scene before him!Around the lake was a fortified wall, blocking all possible views. Emerald Flow Lake was famous for its tranquility, but now, in the middle of the night the deafening commotion of construction went on.There were numerous brawny overseers with their leather whips supervising on the side. In the middle of the lake, there was a gazebo. Gu Du Xing stood motionless there with his arms crossed in front of his chest. His gaze was as cold as a blade, watching over the entire surroundings.He continued like that without moving, but somehow he made the atmosphere around Emerald Flow Lake feel chilly like the end of autumn.At the floor of the gazebo was some sort of chaotic mess. Upon closer observation, it turned out more than ten people were tossed there. They were not dead bodies, but those people were about half dead. The bunch of them let out feeble moans but none dared to yell out loud.One of them groaned a little too loudly, and Gu Du Xing, seemingly relaxing above, yelled coldly, \u201cNoisy!\u201d\u201cBam\u2026\u201d Half a piece of tile fell down from the roof and hit the wound on the man\u2019s leg. A painful wail rose. That person wanted to cry more, but dared not make any more noises. He just bore his suffering and suppressed it internally.All those around him shuddered in fear.Still in his dumbfounded state, Chu Yang ran closer. He smacked his own head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault\u2026 I did not tell Gu Du Xing clearly that I only wanted the center island. Now this guy has taken over the entire lake!\u201d\u201cYou have arrived?\u201d Gu Du Xing flew down from the pavilion like a cloud and landed in front of Chu Yang. With the exception of that previous drunken incident where his face was a little friendly, the sober Gu Du Xing continued to show the icy appearance of a cadaver.\u201cAh, you did these things?\u201d Chu Yang pointed to the surrounding area.\u201cUh huh. I took over all of Emerald Flow Lake!\u201d Gu Du Xing said coolly, \u201cWe have a lot of money, and we needed to be fast, so I invited all of the construction teams here.\u201dChu Yang was reeling, \u201cWhat happened with those people?\u201d He pointed to the bunch of people who got their limbs broken by Gu Du Xing.\u201cThis is a minor thing, not worth mentioning at all.\u201d Gu Du Xing said calmly, \u201cI heard that this area belonged to some officials; these are their people. Mostly housekeepers, and such. Anyone that came to cause trouble, I gave them a beating and sent them running. I already sent many of them away.\u201dGu Du Xing rolled his eyes and said coldly, \u201cJust a few officials, and they dared to interfere with our work. They really are gutsy!\u201dChu Yang rubbed his forehead and asked cautiously, \u201cDid you kill anyone?\u201dIn his heart, he was quietly praying that this man did not kill too many people. If that was the case, it might be hard to clean up after them. Even with Tie Bu Tian wiping his butt\u2026 it would still be a little unreasonable. Taking over people\u2019s properties and killing them would make them look like criminals.He looked around a little, and saw numerous injured people. As for dead bodies\u2026 there seemed to be none.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I have self-control.\u201d When Gu Du Xing said this, Chu Yang relaxed quite a bit. However, he almost keeled over as Gu Du Xing continued, \u201cI just killed a dozen or so people. Not a big deal, but having dead bodies here is unlucky, so I had people drag them away.\u201dChu Yang\u2019s body trembled and his face darkened. Finally, he could only raise his thumb, \u201cYou are really ruthless!\u201d\u201cA weak tolerance does not make a gentleman; without cruelty, there is no great man!\u201d Gu Du Xing said casually, \u201cOnly those who are cruel can live in this world!\u201dChu Yang was silent. He finally waved his arm and said, \u201cI am going to sleep.\u201d\u201cWait.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s your turn to watch for a while. I have been watching all day. Now I need to practice my sword work and rest.\u201d Gu Du Xing did not bother turning back and just walked off. Before leaving, he left these words, \u201cThere is no place to sleep here. I had all the old structures destroyed. You should just make do by finding some place to sit.\u201dChu Yang, \u201c\u2026\u201d (walkthejianghu.com)Chu Yang had all the injured people brought to the lake\u2019s side. Gu Du Xing was nowhere to be seen at this point.Chu Yang stood quietly for a while before shaking his head in resignation. After that, he found a secluded place near the lake and sat down with his legs crossed. He activated Nine Tribulations Transcending the Nine Heavens Technique.For Chu Yang, each day, around bedtime was the best time for cultivation! He definitely did not want to waste that precious time.He followed his thought and entered the sea of his mind. Chu Yang also concentrated on getting rid of impurities. All things between heaven and earth became completely peaceful! And just like that, he slowly rid himself of all distractions as his heart became like a quiet lake surface.The construction site was currently noisy and bustling, but it did not seem to have an effect on his cultivation.From a distance, Gu Du Xing was in a frenzy, practicing with his sword. Suddenly he shot toward Chu Yang\u2019s direction; his mind was in shock.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHow could this be? He is only a fourth grade Martial Warrior?!Even though Gu Du Xing was practicing his sword arts, he never stop paying attention to Chu Yang\u2019s movements. Since the day the word \u201cbrother\u201d was spoken, Gu Du Xing felt as if he had a place to lean on. He felt as if he had a family member, Chu Yang!Though the two never talked about ranks, Gu Du Xing knew that Chu Yang was younger than him. And though he and Chu Yang did not know each other before, he gave him a home and helped him when he was at the end of his rope. He even promised to help him reach the pinnacle of his cultivation\u2026Since the day Chu Yang said that he would help him so that he would not let down Gu Miao Ling\u2019s love, Gu Du Xing already saw Chu Yang as not only his savior but a brother! A brother who he would share life and death with!Because my brother understood me, knew everything about me!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But now he had one more person to worry about, Chu Yang. At first glance, Chu Yang seemed to act mature, but Gu Du Xing knew that his maturity was borne from being through many hardships in life!Every time he thought about this, Gu Du Xing felt greatly distressed. Compared to Chu Yang, Gu Du Xing felt he was luckier by far. At least when he was young, he had the love, attention, and care of his parents. After his family\u2019s tragedy, he was taken care of by his foster father. It could be said that he did not suffer too much hardship.But Chu Yang?Gu Du Xing felt Chu Yang was like a little brother who was forced to grow up, and was in need of his care and protection. There was no reason; this kind of feeling naturally arose.At first, he thought that Chu Yang\u2019s cultivation was higher than his. He absolutely did not imagine that Chu Yang\u2019s cultivation was actually just grade four Martial Warrior! Therefore, when he witnessed Chu Yang cultivating tonight, he was initially startled and stupefied.Gu Du Xing thought to himself: So what if he is only grade four? With me here, who would dare to do anything to him? So what if he barely has any martial power? Is Gu Du Xing the type of person that would stand by and watch while his brother is in danger?With such thoughts, Gu Du Xing felt completely relaxed. However, the moment he raised up his sword and tried to continue cultivating, he was taken aback once again. He immediately turned and looked in Chu Yang\u2019s direction again. This time, he used too much force and almost twisted his neck.Chu Yang, how\u2026 how did he enter meditative state already? Gu Du Xing was at a complete loss; for a grade four Martial Warrior to enter meditative state immediately after sitting down was too monstrous! Even a Martial Great Master could not be that fast!Gu Du Xing stared with his eyes wide opened.On the edge of the pond, the chaotic construction site suddenly seemed far away; in fact, it seemed to have disappeared from this world altogether. The wind gently blew creating tiny ripples on the lake\u2019s surface. Each wave gently hit the shore, one after another in an endless cycle.In this moment, this lake\u2019s quiet sounds were carried toward Chu Yang by the curtain of the dark night. Inside his mind, a spiritual light flashed. His energy continued to move as before but part of his consciousness was concentrated on the sounds created by those gentle waves lapping against the shore. Time slowly passed by, and it was as if Chu Yang had appeared next to a quiet, small lake, whose surface was calm enough to reflect the vast sky.Chu Yang\u2019s mind was even more peaceful this time compared to all other times he was in his meditative state. His whole body seemed to have escaped from the bondage of life and became immersed in that tiny lake of his mind\u2026On the other side, Gu Du Xing sighed. This Chu Yang is some sort of abnormality\u2026 With such abilities, there is no doubt that he would surpass me in a short time. Entering meditative state right after sitting down, I can\u2019t beat that\u2026However, after he finished sighing, he immediately felt that Chu Yang\u2019s breath had become elusive. Gu Du Xing was once again startled and turned around. His left hand rubbed his eyes in disbelief. This person entered meditative state just after sitting down. And after only a few breath, he was already able to advance into the enlightened state! (TLN: Total escape from reality.)Gu Du Xing almost yelled out loud.For Gu Du Xing, he must be in meditative state for at least two hours before entering the enlightened state! This was cultivation at the most profound level; this was when the consciousness and thoughts become one. Compared to the normal meditative state, cultivation would be twice as effective in the enlightened state!Chu Yang could advance into it so easily?Monstrous\u2026 (walkthejianghu.com)The edge of Gu Du Xing\u2019s mouth curved into a slightly bitter smile. He had always thought that he was a rarity in the Middle Three Heavens. He did not expect this kid who was younger than him by a few years could make him lose almost all of his confidence with just a few breaths!Inside his consciousness, Chu Yang slowly opened his eyes and stared intensely at the little waves tirelessly lapping at the shore. He started to understand a little\u2026 These waves might not have that much strength, but they did not cease to advance, retreat, advance again, retreat again, \u2026No even slightly weary.Chu Yang could not help but think: Just like a person cultivating, these extremely ordinary waves did not become cheerful because of a little success and did not become weary because of a little failure. They were not rash but simply continued to aim straight ahead\u2026 not knowing how their cultivation would increase\u2026He continued to stare as he felt the energy in his body slowing becoming like the waves endlessly flowing through his meridians and lapping in an energy circle. One round after another, quietly advancing\u2026At this moment, Chu Yang\u2019s consciousness advanced into an even more profound state. He felt as if all of heaven and earth suddenly became nothing. No material, no desire, nothing existed. His whole body seemed to have dissolved into the quiet pond in front of him, softly becoming the gentle waves that went back and forth\u2026This process by itself seemed able to gather all emotions in life: contentment and happiness, sweetness and tranquility\u2026 It was as if they could go on forever, and one would not be bored\u2026In a distance, Gu Du Xing mouth opened wide as he stared. His mouth opened wide like a hippo. His sword quietly dropped to the ground\u2026Gu Du Xing collapsed!Oh god! Help me. Tell me this is not real!How could this be?! Gu Du Xing was pulling his hair and it was not until he felt great pain that he came to his senses. Oh god! The legendary heaven and man becoming one; this peak state\u2026 I can\u2019t believe it actually happened in front of me.Earlier, when he discovered a strange happening, he did not turn back. He even had hoped that Chu Yang could stay in the enlightened state for a long time; the longer the better. This would have been good for his cultivation\u2026However, he did not expect what happened next. An even more monstrous thing happened in front of him. He clearly could see Chu Yang sitting there, but he no longer was able to feel Chu Yang\u2019s existence!Such a situation could only happened for one reason: heaven and man becoming one, the ultimate state of enlightenment in martial arts! It transcended normal cultivation, and only existed in the realm of legends! This state was supposed to be achievable only upon reaching the level of Martial King!Even with Martial Kings, this was not common. Only in the occasional realm of deep understanding can this state occur! According to legends, each time a person advanced into this state, the yield would not be small!Bu how could this rare situation happen? Normally, absolute serenity must be maintained for more than two hours of the enlightened state before having a small chance of entering the heaven and man becoming one state. Rushing would guarantee failure! Everything must happen naturally! If disturbed, everything would be for naught; plus, there would be a decrease in level also!But Chu Yang, how\u2026 how could he, in this loud construction with the lapping water of the lake, advanced into the \u2018heaven and man becoming one\u2019 state? This\u2026 Are there any heavenly laws left?Gu Du Xing plopped his butt on the ground! It hit hard on a rock, but all his senses still did not come back.After Chu Yang entered this peak state, he leisurely explored. At this moment, the interspace where Nine Tribulations Sword tip resided opened up, as if it was breathing in and out. Above the water of the lake, a layer of fog, unseen by the naked eye, slowly gathered. It flew in the air, and, as if guided by some unseen force, twirled around Chu Yang\u2019s body. Finally, it quickly entered his body, and disappeared\u2026Time slowly passed by. Another layer of fog gathered on the lake\u2019s surface\u2026And then another layer\u2026Who knew how long, two hours, four hours\u2026Gu Du Xing remained stunned where he sat, soaked in dew. The first ray on sunlight just rose behind the curtain of fog, but Chu Yang still did not rouse.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euUnder Gu Du Xing\u2019s gaze, the air around Chu Yang suddenly stirred.Chu Yang\u2019s level was going up slowly\u2026 It was only because of this that Gu Du Xing could still feel Chu Yang\u2019s existence\u2026Grade four Martial Warrior, mid-level grade four Martial Warrior, top-level grade four Martial Warrior\u2026 peak\u2026 breakthrough!Grade five Martial Warrior!Gu Du Xing felt his jaw dropped to the ground!

This guy has totally transcended beyond the \u201chuman\u201d category!The advancement in martial arts level became more and more difficult as your level got higher. Each level was divided into nine grades, and each grade was divided into top, middle, and low. Had it not always been the case that people broke through step after step, slowly accumulating?While Martial Warrior level was still low and using elixirs to advance by multiple orders at a time was not strange, but not using any elixirs and advancing in one shot during cultivation like that was unheard of. The living legend, Limitless Extreme Saber Liu Yong Xiang of Upper Three Heavens, broke through the ranks of Martial Warrior in four days during his youth. This record had not been broken by anyone.However, today, Gu Du Xing saw with his own eyes, a freak who broke through from low to top grade in two hours! He actually witnessed this wonder!Gu Du Xing swallowed, feeling extremely inferior.Aaaah\u2026 god! He\u2019s still not done. Gu Du Xing\u2019s eyes widened because he felt Chu Yang\u2019s energy fluctuated once again.Mid-level grade five Martial Warrior!The term thunderstruck could not describe the shock and fear that Gu Du Xing was feeling right now. He was numb!Top-level grade five Martial Warrior!Peak of grade five Martial Warrior!Grade six!Mid-level grade six!Aaaaaah\u2026 god! Thank goodness he\u2019s finally stopped! If not, I would probably vomit blood. He stopped at the peak of grade six! Gu Du Xing banged his head on the ground as he said a silent prayer\u2026 Living with such an anomaly really hurt one\u2019s self-esteem!I\u2026 I am also a\u2026 a\u2026 talent, ah\u2026 Compared to that guy, I\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2026 might as well bang my head against the wall and die.He went up two grades in less than four hours\u2026 Gu Du Xing felt as if he was dreaming, an incredible, absurd, bizarre dream!Finally, Chu Yang emerged from that miraculous state.At the moment he came to, the voice of Nine Tribulations Sword rose in Chu Yang\u2019s head, \u201cYou have finally come to understand the power of heaven and earth!\u201d The voice was filled with happiness.\u201cThe power of heaven and earth?\u201d Chu Yang asked skeptically, \u201cIs this the power of heaven and earth?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 This is still far lacking compared to the power of heaven and earth. What you have just experienced was one of one hundred thousand types of forces of heaven and earth, Gentle Force of water. This is a lucky chance. Your previous life was filled with hardship; your head was so preoccupied with revenge, you were not able to see anything else. I cannot believe you were able to experience one type so early in this life.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWater is divided into tangible and intangible forces. Tangible energy force includes Roaring Sea Force, Flash Flood Destructive Force, Heaven\u2019s Water Force, and Heaven\u2019s Violence Force. What you just experienced was the Gentle Force of the tangible forces.\u201d\u201cWhat is the use of this force?\u201d\u201cConquering with gentleness.\u201d That voice said, \u201cAs to how to use it, that depends on you. There is nothing Nine Tribulations Transcending the Nine Heavens Technique cannot use.\u201d\u201cAh. Then in that case, mountains, rivers, oceans, lakes, forest, dirt, wind, lightning, rain, snow, and clouds all carry different forces?\u201d Chu Yang mused.\u201cYou can\u2019t even imagine. If you could experience them then that is your good fortune. If you could not, then anything I say would be meaningless. This is a matter of chance and understanding.\u201d That tiny voice slowly disappeared.\u201cHmm\u2026 Isn\u2019t the purpose of your existence to show me the way to these chances?\u201d Chu Yang asked.Not a sound answered him; it seemed that voice had fallen asleep once again.Chu Yang knew that Nine Tribulations Sword was not a cure-all. If he wanted to reach the peak of cultivation, he must depend on himself. Whether it was Nine Tribulations Sword or Nine Tribulations Transcending the Nine Heavens Technique, even with the sword spirit, they could not replace the actual person.Only when he reached a certain specific point by his own efforts would Nine Tribulations Sword tell him the appropriate details. If he did not work hard, then holding the most powerful weapon in the world would be equivalent to holding a rotten piece of wood!Chu Yang mused. That little reminder earlier was enough open his eyes to the vast infinite nature of martial arts!Before, Chu Yang had cultivated following a small and narrow path. But, currently, he could see the wide open space and blue sky, a universe without end.With an elated sigh, Chu Yang stood up. His joints cracked\u2026 It was not until he looked up at the morning sky, that he was somewhat surprised. Clearly, he only sat for less than four hours; how could this phenomenon happened? It was definitely not from fatigue, but for the joints to crack like that, you normally had to sit for the whole night!Normally, when he would sit and cultivate for the whole night, this phenomenon would happen in combination with the feeling of fatigue. Today, he felt refreshed, as if freed from some shackles and his whole body was so light it could fly. It was like instead of cultivating, he had a great night of sleep.He tried activating his energy a little bit when energy suddenly surged up from his dantian and flowed around his meridians. Chu Yang felt something was not right and immediately tried to push the energy flow for another round. His mouth gaped; normally, the energy could not reach two consecutive points at once, but this time, it was unexpectedly unimpeded.Breakthrough? (walkthejianghu.com)Chu Yang could not contain his excitement. He could not believe that only after four hours of cultivation, he was able to breakthrough two grades. This was too fantastic!Chu Yang felt completely relaxed when a person appeared in front of him. Staring at Gu Du Xing, he only saw a haggard face and two bloodshot eyes staring back at him. His countenance was scary, but the cold dead look he normally carried around was not there.\u201cHuh, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Chu Yang asked in surprise.\u201cWhat\u2026 What is what?\u201d Gu Du Xing gritted his teeth and let out a low growl, \u201cWhat do you have to say?\u201dChu Yang scratched his head and asked in annoyance, \u201cIs there something important?\u201dGu Du Xing went berserk. He jumped up and roared loudly, \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d\u201cHow did I do what?\u201d Chu Yang asked in confusion.\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 Are you still human?\u201d Gu Du Xing hurriedly circled Chu Yang. Then he bent down his head, with his nose almost touching Chu Yang\u2019s nose, \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 are you going to tell me? How did you\u2026 you\u2026 ah\u2026 how did you advance two grades in four hours? Aaaaaaaaah\u2026!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Du Xing almost cried. Mother*, this guy is pretending to be innocent!\u201cAh, you are talking about this?\u201d Chu Yang innocently scratched his head, \u201cTo tell you the truth, I am not sure about this myself. I only discovered that I had advanced two grades when I came to. I am still secretly happy about it.\u201dYou are not sure about this? Secretly happy? Gu Du Xing could only see blue and red stars holding hands and dancing in front of his eyes; his whole world was spinning. He let out two moans and looked at Chu Yang in disbelief. Finally, he slammed his foot down and took a deep breath to suppress his rising blood pressure. In the end, he suddenly felt that this kind of thing might not be clear to the party involved either.When it comes Martial Warrior rookies like Chu Yang, it was even more possible that he did not know. This was just his good fortune! Everything was borne out of a state of unconsciousness. If Chu Yang was aware of what was going on\u2026 that would have been an impossible thing.\u201cI really don\u2019t know!\u201d Chu Yang said innocently, \u201cI was just cultivating when I just suddenly broke through\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He almost wanted to kick Chu Yang. This was too much! Someone so clueless like this advanced so quickly. While I witnessed it from beginning to end at that\u2026 I, myself, have been pursuing this state for so many years and have not experienced it even once.With that thought, Gu Du Xing suddenly became so emotional he almost cried, \u201cI\u2026 I should be the one who advanced.\u201dChu Yang didn\u2019t have any answers. How could he not want Gu Du Xing to quickly advance in his cultivation? After all, his own strength was still too weak; advancing by two grades was of little use\u2026 On the other hand, Gu Du Xing was a grade five Sword Great Master. Even if he advanced by only one grade, his fighting strength would greatly increase.However, this sort of thing depended entirely on chance and the person\u2019s understanding. If Chu Yang tried to help him understand before his due time, it might even cause a delay in his advancement in cultivation. It could even lead to Gu Du Xing never being able to experience the states that Chu Yang told him about!It can only be yours if you experienced it yourself. No matter how good the other person\u2019s experience was, it was still their own thoughts. How could two people\u2019s thoughts be the same?If Gu Du Xing had already experienced what Chu Yang experienced earlier during his cultivation, then Chu Yang would imitate the sword spirit and give him some hints on how to get the best results\u2026 But, currently Gu Du Xing had yet to arrive at these states. Telling him anything at all would not be good for his future.Chu Yang understood this principle; Gu Du Xing understood as well. Therefore, they were both gloomy.\u201cThis\u2026 that state, how did you enter it?\u201d Gu Du Xing asked with a ray of hope. But as soon as those words escaped from his mouth, he immediately shook his head, \u201cNever mind. I am guessing you don\u2019t entirely know it either. This kind of mysterious state, even if you knew ahead of time, you couldn\u2019t enter it anyway.\u201d\u201cVery wise. You know a lot.\u201d Chu Yang praised with a thumb up. But that kind of compliment only made Gu Du Xing\u2019s face flashed red and white; he became even more depressed\u2026\u201cI don\u2019t know how to advance into such states. More importantly, I cannot tell you about my own experience. But I know one thing\u2026\u201d Chu Yang looked at Gu Du Xing, and said slowly, \u201c\u2026That is\u2026 You are in too much of a rush. You should know that haste makes waste! The more you rush, the less you will accomplish. Currently, you have not entered any states. You could keep training hard, but you will end up destroying yourself!\u201dGu Du Xing was stunned\u2026 He suddenly stood erect with a pensive look\u2026 These words Chu Yang just spoke seemed to have struck a chord and woke him up\u2026He quietly thought for a moment. His breathing normalized, and he said calmly, \u201cThat is right. I have been in too much of a hurry. This was my dark side. Your experiences and your advancements are your own thoughts and chances\u2026 If I am to have my own experience, that would be my own chance. Why must I forcefully ask for it? I only need myself.\u201dChu Yang smiled and said profoundly, \u201cIn the end, you will need to depend on yourself.\u201dThese words were part of what Chu Yang just came to understand. Any enlightenments related to the world of martial arts could not be told to Gu Du Xing. But enlightenment about life could definitely be shared.\u201cDepend on yourself.\u201d Gu Du Xing\u2019s right hand held tightly onto the hilt of his sword. His whole body seemed as if it had been transformed into an unsheathed sword, and radiated a sharp energy\u2026 His eyes gradually brightened.Depend on yourself did not mean to not get any help from friends and live alone your entire life\u2026 It simply meant to rely on your best efforts and your own state of mind. Of course, Gu Du Xing understood this very well.\u201cChu Yang! Brother! You have helped me once again.\u201d Gu Du Xing said sincerely as he gazed upon the morning light rising from the east.\u201cYou once said if there was a mountain of knives in front of me, walk on you without any regrets. \u201c Chu Yang smiled, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, before going over that mountain, what is this little favor I am doing for you?\u201dGu Du Xing smiled and stood up. With a rarely seen peaceful smile, he repeated softly, \u201cRight, if in front of you is a mountain of knives, I will let you walk on me to cross it.\u201dHe said these words really quietly, barely emitting a sound\u2026 Chu Yang could only see his lips move slightly but could not hear what he was saying. But Gu Du Xing knew that this was no different than him making an oath.He knew Chu Yang\u2019s previous words were out of jest. But Gu Du Xing was also sure that if, one day, there was a mountain of knives in front of him, Chu Yang would probably do the same for him.There were some things that need not be said; they were better off kept inside one\u2019s heart. Therefore, Gu Du Xing did not say anything else\u2026 he simply took those words and engraved them deep in his heart.\u201cBy tomorrow, this wall border will be complete. As for the rooms inside, I have already given the work orders. For now, I want to go out for a bit.\u201d Gu Du Xing stared at the calm lake surface as he spoke, \u201cIf we just keep sitting here, no martial experts will come and join us. I need to go out and choose a few more people. Also to\u2026 kill a few more people!\u201d\u201cOkay, leave all of this to me.\u201d (walkthejianghu.com)Gu Du Xing said slowly, \u201cI ran away from home to also give myself a chance to train. A phenomenon of heaven and earth had appeared; all of the Nine Heavens will change. Middle Three Heavens and Upper Three Heavens all have disciples of large family clans coming out to train. Moreover, they are all outstanding talents from one clan or another\u2026\u201dGu Du Xing did not have to finish for Chu Yang to understand his intentions. He interrupted, \u201cSo you intend to recruit these people?\u201d The moment Chu Yang finished his question, he immediately felt disturbed\u2026 The world is changing, the Nine Heavens are changing, family clans training\u2026 what does all this mean?This never happened in the previous life\u2026 The appearance of these people in Lower Three Heavens, what will happen now? How will fate be affected? What will happen to this continent? What effects will all these things have?Gu Du Xing thought for a little, and finally shook his head, \u201cI am not sure\u2026\u201dHe thought a little more and sighed, \u201cI am not sure at all.\u201dChu Yang smiled. He understood Gu Du Xing\u2019s meaning when he said the phrase \u201c\u2026 not sure\u2026\u201d First, when it came to getting talented people from powerful families into Heavenly Armament Pavilion, it would be difficult. Each of these people was extremely talented; how could they agree to be subservient to others? Second, if he did manage to get someone to join, that person would not want to be under anyone. In fact, that person might just want to take over the whole thing. In that case, he was not sure if he could stop that person.After all, how could these little masters not take a few powerful guards with them when they go out to train? And the strength of just Gu Du Xing and Chu Yang was still very weak.\u201cThe two sons of your foster father, which one will be coming down here?\u201d Chu Yang asked.\u201cThey are both coming down.\u201d Gu Du Xing let out a faint smile, \u201cThey are very competitive with each other; neither of them would agree to sit still.\u201d Gu Du Xing smiled and said cynically.\u201cShould we kill them?\u201d Chu Yang suggested sincerely, \u201cThey have always walked all over you. Later on, they surely will not leave you alone. Have you ever thought about this?\u201dGu Du Xing was shocked. His eyes expressed mixed feelings as he looked at Chu Yang, \u201cIf I had intended to kill them, I would have killed them already.\u201d He turned and said quietly, \u201cNo matter what, they are still my foster father\u2019s sons. He only has these two sons. Plus, they are Sister Xiao Miao\u2019s brothers. If the two of them died\u2026 I am afraid my foster father and Sister Xiao Miao would be devastated. As for the Gu family, they would no longer have a successor.\u201d\u201cIt is strange, but I want to kill them more than you do. But I will never kill them. Because of the Gu family, because my foster father\u2019s care for me was as great as a mountain, and because of Sister Xiao Miao.\u201d Gu Du Xing said sincerely, \u201cI would even protect them if they were in danger.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe laughed bitterly, \u201cIt\u2019s contradictory, right?\u201d\u201cGu Du Xing.\u201d Chu Yang said earnestly, \u201cYou are truly a great man. No, you are a model of what a man should be. To kill is a great man. But to not kill is a role model for all men.\u201d\u201cTo kill is a great man. But to not kill is a role model for all men.\u201d Gu Du Xing quietly repeated. A little later, he smiled and shook his head without saying anything. He quietly stood for a while, looking at the eastern sky. Afterward, he took a deep breath and said, \u201cThe sun is up, I am going. At the latest, I should be back within a month.\u201dWithout waiting for Chu Yang\u2019s answer, he lifted his arms. Like a gliding eagle, he did not fly up, but touched the water surface with his feet twice before reaching the shore on the other side. From a distance, he waved goodbye. His body shook twice, and he completely disappeared.On the lake, the two ripples created where Gu Du Xing\u2019s feet touched the water were still slowly spreading outward.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He seemed to be waiting for something\u2026Morning came. The massive lakeside construction made the entire area noisy. Since last night, after Tie Bu Tian reprimanded the two officials, the six great families dared not come and ask about those properties anymore. However, they were not shy about getting justice. After all, their guards and servants had either died or suffered from injuries. All their housekeepers were also detained.This caused a great uproar amongst the aristocrats of Iron Cloud Citadel.People came to ask for justice. People came to look at the excitement. There were even some officials who came to help mediate. It was chaos!But this chaos barely lasted five minutes when there was suddenly a voice like thunder rumbling from all four directions. A group of guards came out from all directions. The leader shouted, \u201cHis majesty has decreed that Emerald Flow Lake will be a place to recruit new soldiers. Anyone who dares to get in the way will be charged with treason, and will end up losing all properties and having all nine generations of his family killed!\u201dThe group of guards did a few laps around the lake, and shouted out the royal decree ten times. After that, they dismounted from their horses and groups of two stood guard in each direction. The rest of the guards returned to the palace.Throughout the whole ordeal, the troublemakers dared not even look up at the guards. The terror brought on by this decree was obvious.The people from the great families looked at each morosely and left.In the gazebo, Chu Yang closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep; he did not make a sound. It was not until the guards left that he opened his two eyes and smiled with satisfaction.Tie Bu Tian\u2019s way of doing things was definitely agreeable.This had shown how important Chu Yang was to him.\u201cIn this case, I will immediately help you with your internal affairs!\u201d Chu Yang smiled slightly and stood up.Chu Yang did not arrive at Bu Tian Pavilion until noon. At this time, Cheng Zi Ang\u2019s people were busy finding anything suspicious from the information they got yesterday.Since morning until now, they have already sent out three groups to do their jobs. When they saw Chu Yang arrive, everyone in the pavilion looked at him with admiration. (walkthejianghu.com)\u201cTell the three groups that already went out that they are to record everything along the way, no matter how small. In the process of doing their job, they must not let others know that they are making notes of these details!\u201d Chu Yang ordered, \u201cIn addition, anyone who went through Bu Tian Recruitment House must have his identity verified.\u201dChu Yang\u2019s eyes scanned the room, \u201cAll those masters hired by Bu Tian Recruitment House, after passing the verification process, must sign their names.

Patriots need food, too; they also want to get married and have a family; they also desire wealth and luxury!\u201dHe smiled and looked at the two, \u201cEven you two are like that!\u201dCheng Zi Ang and Chen Yu Tong looked at each other; each saw a flash in the other\u2019s eyes.\u201cThe prince really said those things?\u201d Cheng Zi Ang still felt suspicious. He thought that his Revered Saber Artist cultivation, while not a top level master in Lower Three Heavens, was enough to make a contribution and rule a region without much difficulty.If Tie Bu Tian really promised so, then I must work hard and try even harder!\u201cI can testify to this!\u201d Chu Yang said sincerely.On the two people\u2019s faces appeared an uncontrollable happiness.\u201cEnough! Send all documents on every Iron Cloud official to me. Let\u2019s start with Iron Cloud Citadel. Only the fifth rank officials and higher; I don\u2019t need the lower ranking ones!\u201d With that, Chu Yang immediately turned and walked out.There was one thing he did not say: Diwu Qing Rou would not waste his time with the lower ranks anyway!As for what Chu Yang said about the rewards, one hundred taels was not much, but becoming royal officials in the court, generals on the battlefield, or honorary royal family members\u2026 These were much more attractive to people. In this time period, leaders and officials were greatly valued. For those in Jiang Hu who would normally resort to robbery and thieving, this was especially inviting!Chu Yang could gander a guess as to what kind of sensation this would create after the notices go out.News of Chu Yang\u2019s request for documents on the officials quickly got to Tie Bu Tian\u2019s ears. This prince immediately went to see Chu Yang with such haste, it was as if there was a fire burning behind his butt.\u201cSenior Chu, you want to cleanse\u2026 the royal court?\u201d Tie Bu Tian hastily asked before he could even sit down properly.\u201cAh! Is that not okay?\u201d Chu Yang asked back.Tie Bu Tian smiled. He always felt that his relationship with Chu Yang was a little weird. He practiced Emperor Saintly Technique, and while he was very busy recently, he never stopped. Therefore he carried a regal aura of a ruler that all those who faced him would find intimidating.However, each time he faced Chu Yang, he was treated like an ordinary person. Tie Bu Tian could not imagine how fortified Chu Yang\u2019s mind must be. According to the information he had, Chu Yang was only a youth of seventeen!\u201cIron Cloud\u2019s royal court has been through three cleansings already! To do this again now, would be too soon\u2026\u201d Tie Bu Tian said with a trace of bitterness, \u201cSince Iron Cloud fell into this weak position, many officials even left their Iron Cloud posts. Especially at the borders, many of them moved over to Great Zhao and attempted to enter that political arena\u2026\u201dTie Bu Tian had every intention to straighten out the royal court, but he did not expect Chu Yang to make his move so quickly.\u201cDo you believe that those kinds of people are useful to Iron Cloud?\u201d Chu smiled cynically, \u201cLike a phoenix, after burning to ashes it will live again. Only from great suffering can this country be truly powerful. If there is only smooth failing, then the only path will be that of destruction!\u201d\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d Tie Bu Tian said miserably, \u201cCurrently, we do not have many people left, let alone replacing them!\u201d\u201cBetter to have a trustworthy few!\u201d Chu Yang said coldly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTie Bu Tian lowered his head and thought for a while. Then he lifted his head and said, \u201cLet\u2019s do this! I will give you a list of a few hundred old families. In the cleansing process, if you have to deal with these people, at least give them a way out!\u201dTie Bu Tian laughed at himself, \u201cThese families are deeply rooted in Iron Cloud. If they rise up, I am afraid Iron Cloud would be shaken. That year, Second Uncle tried his best to avoid them even through two cleansings. You should pay close attention!\u201dChu Yang considered for a little and said, \u201cAlright! But if I really can\u2019t avoid it, I will use a more gentle method.\u201dTie Bu Tian pretended not to understand Chu Yang\u2019s meaning, \u201cThat would be good! Whether it is to rule a nation or to do anything else, a little gentleness is always good!\u201dThe two people looked at each other and smiled. They finally have an understanding. Tie Bu Tian understood Chu Yang\u2019s meaning of the word \u201cgentle\u201d very well, but he did not say it. An unspoken understanding was wise, whereas openly saying it out loud would be foolish! (TLN: Your guess is as good as mine, but I suddenly remembered that Ma Tuo Zi was really gentle.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 100 \u2013 Minister ChuTie Bu Tian was silent when he suddenly raised his brows and asked, \u201cEmerald Flow Lake\u2026 how is it?\u201d\u201cVery good!\u201d Chu Yang said cheerfully, filled with satisfaction, \u201cAbout the award system for the candidates, what does Your Highness think?\u201dTie Bu Tian laughed mischievously, \u201cVery good.\u201dChu Yang also laughed. Both of their laughs seemed to carry some hidden thoughts.\u201cI already ordered Cheng Zi Ang to leave all decisions in regards to Bu Tian Pavilion\u2019s matters to you.\u201d Tie Bu Tian looked at Chu Yang seriously, \u201cBut I need to get information from your side, because I cannot remain deaf to it all!\u201dChu Yang was moved by these words. They had shown that Tie Bu Tian was very sincere.\u201cI know! That\u2019s why I just put a little pressure on him instead of getting rid of him. But there is something I am not too clear on! Why do you trust me so?\u201d Chu Yang said.Tie Bu Tian calmly looked at Chu Yang for a moment. Then he slowly smiled and said, \u201cIntuition! I sensed that you are a trustworthy person! It\u2019s that simple!\u201dChu Yang suddenly discovered that Tie Bu Tian\u2019s smile was very fascinating. It started at his eyes, and traveled gradually to the tip of his nose which moved slightly. Then it reached the edge of his mouth which stretched. And finally, it reached his cheeks.His eyes brightened every time he smiled, and made others feel very happy. In this moment, Tie Bu Tian\u2019s smile does not carry any majestic aura. It is\u2026 umm\u2026 lovable! Yes!! Very lovable!!!Strangely, this line of thought rose inside Chu Yang, startling him. He continually reminded himself: Chu Yang!\u2026 That is a man! That is a man\u2026!!!Seeing Chu Yang staring at him, mesmerized, Tie Bu Tian became annoyed all of a sudden and said, \u201cI will leave now!!!\u201dWithout waiting for Chu Yang to see him off, Tie Bu Tian stood up and left with Dragon Tiger Steps, and quickly disappeared.It was as if he was running away!Chu Yang mouth became crooked as he muttered, \u201cCome on, must you use such an imposing air even when leaving? Clearly he just used a technique for emperors! Mother*! If he didn\u2019t use that technique would anyone say he\u2019s not a prince? That was a little extreme!\u201dAfter leaving Bu Tian Pavilion, Tie Bu Tian suddenly remembered, \u201cOops! I forgot to tell him about the movements at the border\u2026\u201dHe was going to turn around but decided against it after thinking it over. \u201cThis little fox, every time he talks to me he always looked straight into my eyes, making me so nervous\u2026\u201dTie Bu Tian was a prince whose authority had been growing greater and greater over the past few years. With the exception of Tie Long Cheng, no one dared look up when talking to him. But time and time again, Chu Yang proved to be the exception!Chu Yang had a habit of looking into people\u2019s eyes when they talked.Of course Tie Bu Tian did not know that this habit was created by Chu Yang\u2019s Deep Spirit Principle. At any time, Chu Yang always used Deep Spirit Principle to verify if the other person was being truthful. This was truly a good habit! He did not care if the other person was a man or a woman; Chu Yang always used that gaze when talking to people.Because if a person was lying or thinking of something else, there would always be something a little abnormal in their eyes. Very few people have the cultivation state where they could lie without some anxiety in their hearts. And their eyes would show this abnormality.******** (walkthejianghu.com)For the next few days, Chu Yang was very busy.That afternoon, Tie Bu Tian decided to send Wu Qian Qian over to be Minister Chu\u2019s assistant.Chu Yang was dumbfounded with this decision; he did not know whether to laugh or to cry. Everything was going well, and the prince sent a beauty like Wu Qian Qian to these wolves at Bu Tian Pavilion. The minister\u2019s good luck inspired looks of envy and admiration. They all had to praise the favor the prince bestowed upon Minister Chu: \u201cSuch a beauty and the prince was actually willing to send her over\u2026 This really shows how much the prince trusts and values you!\u201dDuring these few days, many tasks were quickly carried out by Bu Tian Pavilion.After cleansing Bu Tian Pavilion, the new minister got started right away. Because he could not show himself, for all deliveries of important documents, he sent the female official the prince sent over, Wu Qian Qian.Each one of those papers was essentially a death sentence! First, an official was arrested. Then, he was handed over to Minister Chu for questioning. After they had all the evidence, the evidence was then submitted to Tie Bu Tian. Finally, a decree was handed down: seizure of all properties and execution of the guilty official.Every now and then, a few other families were also implicated.Even though Minister Chu himself designed special uniforms for the three brigades of Bu Tian Pavilion, they would all wear black when they carried out their tasks. The Fierce Blood Brigade headed by their leader, Cheng Zi Ang, never stopped raiding, arresting, and killing\u2026Iron Blood Brigade headed by Minister Chu continually interrogated, searched for evidence\u2026As for Heavenly Secret Brigade under the leadership of Chen Yu Tong, they took turns deciphering information recovered by their spies to find even the smallest clues. After all that was done, they submitted the results for Minister Chu to make his decisions.It went on non-stop for half a month; the rancid smell of blood filled the sky of Iron Cloud Citadel. Bu Tian Pavilion essentially replaced the Judicial Department; with the exception of the jail cells, everything else was handled by Bu Tian Pavilion.Bu Tian Pavilion worked with efficiency and speed never seen before. Each member did not even have enough energy to complain. They did not stop; they did not rest. Even if they had free time every now and then, they were forced to cultivate.Because as Minister Chu once said, \u201cMembers of Bu Tian Pavilion must be martial experts, must be great talents! If your cultivation does not meet the required standards, you might as well kill yourself so you won\u2019t be killed by others! You want to quit? That is not an option! Once you join, unless you die during a mission, you cannot leave even if you are handicapped. Handicapped people will be given tasks like intelligence analysis\u2026\u201dUnder this strict management, all members of Bu Tian Pavilion moaned and groaned during training. At any given moment, they felt as if there was a saber hanging above their heads.Minister Chu was truly impartial. He once discovered one of the brothers who was close to him not cultivating, he directly ordered him to be paddled two hundred times on the spot.The punishment was so harsh four sticks broke and blood and meat were everywhere.All the while, Minister Chu sat on the side going over various documents while periodically handed out a piece of paper with the words: \u201cContinue paddling! If he dies then he deserves it; if not then he must continue cultivating!\u201dWith the risk of losing their lives, everyone did not make a peep.Under such high pressure, everyone thought that they would not be able to survive. But nine days later, early in the morning, a third grade Martial Master suddenly announced: Under such great pressure he had broken through to grade four Martial Master!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWho did not know how hard it was to breakthrough in cultivation? And so everyone ran over to check it out! After verifying the whole thing, their eyes lit up with jealousy. Under great pressure and such a busy schedule, he still managed to breakthrough\u2026A few days later, some people discovered that after a few years of hitting a cultivation bottleneck, they were on the verge of breakthrough.With such role models, even those not required to breakthrough put greater efforts into cultivation. They could not let themselves fall too far behind the others\u2026 How humiliating would it be? Moreover, with greater strength they would have a greater chance of making a big contribution. Marrying, having children, becoming an official\u2026 everything was waiting for them!!!After that, everyone seemed to understand Chu Yang\u2019s painstaking care. That old repressive atmosphere from before quickly changed to an encouraging one.Minister Chu did everything for our sake!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
