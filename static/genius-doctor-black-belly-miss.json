Come back! You can never get out of here! You belong to me!\u201dMore than ten years of hard work engulfed into nothingness.The girl calmly stopped in her tracks as she turned around to see the man swallowed by the flames, she coldly said: \u201cYou are dying, while I still live.\u201dThe man was screaming in anguish . As she gave a last look at her greatest nightmare, she coldly said: \u201cFarewell, grandfather.\u201dThe cat sitting on the girl\u2019s shoulder gave a contemptuous ridicule and sneered. Grandfather?For someone who was obsessed in studying medicine, a madman who locked his own granddaughter up deep within the mountains using her as a guinea pig , what right did he have to be it\u2019s owner\u2019s grandfather?\u201cMaster, what are your plans?\u201d Ignoring that voice which was gradually engulfed by the flames, the cat asked the girl.She looked at her slender hands and softly answered, \u201cTo test for a veterinary license.\u201d\u201cHa ha ha! That old man, if he knew that you, a peerless genius in the medical field actually want to be a vet, he would certainly not rest in peace.\u201d exclaimed the cat as it was laughing hysterically on the girl\u2019s shoulder.\u201cHe won\u2019t rest in peace?\u201d The girl\u2019s eyes were downcast as her lips slightly brought back a hint of a smile almost.A year later, she settled in City A and obtained a veterinary license, and went on the path of treating animals.\u2026\u2026Life is very unpredictable. Just a moment before she was still in the operating room performing a surgery, however there was an explosion, and she fell into darkness.Heavy rain poured down as she stirred. She found herself lying on some rocks as she gave a calm judgment of the current situation.She was in a strange new world, replacing a dying soul and as she searched the fragments of foreign memories that flooded\u00a0 her mind, she came to realise that this new \u2018her\u2019 was also known as the Wu Xie, but with a surname, Jun.

Arrogant, haughty and unreasonable, not even putting royalty in her eyes, everyone is a miniscule existence in her eyes.Lin w.a.n.g and the founding Emperor of Qi State relations.h.i.+p swore an oath to the heavens to be sworn brothers. When the State of Qi was formed, the founding Emperor personally granted Lin w.a.n.g a grand t.i.tle which rendered him power almost akin to the royalty.In the whole country, it is one of the most revered place, even the current emperor has to be courteous to them. Lin w.a.n.g has two sons, however his extreme doting of his granddaughter Jun Wu Xie has reached a pinnacle. When she took a liking to the Second Prince, Lin w.a.n.g coerced the Emperor to have the Second Prince and his granddaughter betrothed.However, this arrogant woman was now lying on some jagged rocks in such a sorry state, if not for Wu Xie\u2019s soul, she would just be a dead body dumped in the wilderness.\u201cBoth legs fractured, three broken ribs on the left side, dislocated right wrist\u2026Falling from such a height, this body has miraculously survived.\u201d Another voice in the body of Jun Wu Xie sounded, it was the familiar voice of the little black cat which accompanied her for more than a decade and surprisingly it was in the same body.\u201cStill alive.\u201d Jun Wu Xie muttered as she lay on the rocks without any hint of pain on her face, as if the physical pain had nothing to do with her.\u201cCongratulations owner, you\u2019ve escaped death once again.\u201d Black smoke seeped out from Jun Wu Xie\u2019s chest and condensed into a black cat, strutting at her side.She survived a calamity however she was still hovering near death\u2019s door.She felt her energy slowly seeping away as she shuddered from the torrential downpour which was raining down hard on her body.She needed to find a place to shelter from the rain quickly before her body temperature drops further! Luckily, there was a cave under the low cliffs nearby.Relying on her two hands and the sole thought of survival, she dragged herself in the direction of the cave.Her tattered clothes, soaked in sweat and drenched in the downpour, hung from her battered frame. Crimson blood trailed along the path from the wounds on her legs, washed away from the merciless rain hammering down upon the small crawling figure. The black cat gave occasional nudges as encouragement as they made their way towards the cave.Having mustered every ounce of strength she had left in her frail body, although the distance wasn\u2019t far, it was an enduring feat.With such an amount of injuries and over a rough terrain, even those with high endurance would have fainted numourous times.When she finally reached the dark cave, her face was deathly pale, void any of any colour.Huddled against the walls of the cold cave, finally free from the barrage of the rain, she let out a small sigh of relief. Suddenly a ghostly voice came from within that deep dark cave.\u201cWho is it?\u201dThe black cat asked in a scared voice, body arched, as it lunged itself in front of Wu Xie.\u201cGo take a look.\u201d Wu Xie choked out as she knew her current predicament. Alone in such an environment without any medical equipments, she\u2019s unable to carry out her own treatment hence she can only look for other possibilities.Having another person around to help her would be best.Leading the way, the black cat inched closer towards the source of the sound. In the darkness, Wu Xie felt the presence of another person.\u201cYou\u2019re about to die.\u201d A masculine voice doused with a trace of playfulness came from above her head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Beneath the depths of this desolate cliff?As soon as it heard the man\u2019s voice, the black cat immediately turned into a wisp of smoke and hurriedly fled into Wu Xie\u2019s body. This man was dangerous!\u201cYou\u2019re chained up?\u201d Wu Xie totally disregarded his tone of voice as her mind only echoed a single thought, this man can help her. All she needed was \u2026\u2026his freedom of movement.\u201cAh? You mean these small things?\u201d The man in the dark was pulling chains, a deep magnetic voice echoed in the dark caves, \u201cI guess so.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll free you\u2026 but you\u2019ll have to save me.\u201d Wu Xie stuttered as she struggled to get the words out. She was trembling from all the cold and pain. Her body temperature was falling dangerously low and her battered body which was riddled with severe injuries wouldn\u2019t hold up if she didn\u2019t do anything soon.The man in the dark kept quiet, he seemed surprised that this half dead girl would say such words.\u2018Silence means consent\u2019 Wu Xie self-reasoned as she had no other alternatives so she decided to gamble on this chance.As she groped around in the darkness, she leaned on the man and pulled out a thin pin from her hair. She was a doctor, not a thief. That fool had once performed this trick for her, she wasn\u2019t sure if she could pull it off.Wu Xie\u2019s little hands tried to reach for the chains as she fumbled around in the dark. From a doctor\u2019s perspective, she could \u2018feel\u2019 that this man\u2019s physique was exceptional.Using her last shred energy, Wu Xie attempted to free the man with her poor skills. She had never felt so clumsy in her life.With all her toiling efforts, she finally unlocked one! This effort had left her breathing heavily as she struggled to keep her consciousness from fading.\u201cAs per your wish.\u201d The man finally spoke with an enigmatic deep smile, his deep masculine voice echoed throughout the cave.Before she could even react, \u2018click\u2019\u2026 \u2018click\u2019\u2026 \u2018click\u2019, a series of broken metal sounded around her. He broke free from the other three shackles as she felt some warmth as he pulled her into his arms as he embraced her.He gently lifted her up and carried her as he trudged along towards the light.Outside, the rain continued to fall relentlessly.Although the weather was gloomy, it was daytime and just this little light was enough to show off his exquisite face. The man\u2019s high cheekbones, perfectly accentuated his face along with his long satin hair casually draping down. As the crystal clear rainwater ran down his neck, it was G.o.d\u2019s most outstanding work.The man was looking up at the sky, when felt a gaze from her, he bowed his head slightly, violet eyes slightly narrowed, his lips breaking into a smile.Wu Xie looked on indifferently into that pair of purple eyes, without any trace of expression. The rain was falling on her pale cheeks as she calmly watched him.He raised his eyebrow slightly. Her unusually calm demeanour was a refres.h.i.+ng reaction.This is the first time someone didn\u2019t scream and panic when they saw his eyes.\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid?\u201d He asked in his deep husky voice.\u201cI\u2019m about to die\u201d Wu Xie reminded him matter-of-factly. Her dark eyes, looked deeply into that pair of purple eyes, without any hint of desperation or fear, but rather with a clear gaze, as though the death she was talking about wasn\u2019t her own.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How he wanted to rouse her calm demeanour and mess up her pace! This girl was unbelievable, how can she be so calm in such a situation?\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t let you die\u201d he said gently.\u201cSend me home.\u201d She retorted.Considering how badly injured she was, the best option and only use for him was to send her back to her own \u2018home\u2019.He gave a devilish smile, leaned down and kissed Wu Xie right between her eyebrows.\u201cAs you wish.\u201d He chuckled.The little black cat hidden in the depths of Wu Xie was petrified, it\u2019s owner had just been taken advantage of!\u2026..Wu Xie felt her surroundings slowly fading out as she slipped into darkness. When she finally stirred, her long eyelashes fluttered open and she found herself lying down on a nice warm bed in a luxuriously decorated room.A white-haired old man was sitting by her bed and when he saw that she had awoken, his whole face lit up and exclaimed :\u201dSilly girl, you finally woke up! Don\u2019t scare your grandfather!\u201d\u201cSilly girl, it\u2019s just a contractual spirit. So what if you don\u2019t have any? Who do you think I am? I am the almighty Lin w.a.n.g! I\u2019ll support you no matter what. There\u2019s nothing to be afraid of!\u201d Jun Xian huffed.Grandfather?Wu Xie furrowed her brows as the body\u2019s memories flashed through her mind. The old man sitting by her bed was none other than Qi\u2019s state Lin w.a.n.g which is also the former\u2019s Grandfather \u2013 Jun Xian.What Jun Xian mentioned \u2013 \u201ccontractual spirit\u201d was unique to this world.When a baby is born into this world, contractual spirits will form a bond with the human soul and the contractual spirits will sleep in the soul and only awaken at the age of fourteen. A ring will appear on the right hand\u2019s ring finger, each spirit is like an evolution of the soul where each person\u2019s contractual spirit\u2019s form is different. Some can be condensed into a powerful weapon while some can morph into mighty beasts.A few days before was Jun Wu Xie\u2019s fourteenth birthday and there should have been a spiritual awakening, but the whole day nothing happened\u2026She was henceforth labelled as a waste.In this world where one\u2019s future is determined by the strength of their contractual spirits, those that didn\u2019t have any were regarded as wastes.Jun Wu Xie refused to believe it and had never received such a heavy setback in life. She actually went missing for 2 whole days! Jun Xian was shocked, thinking that this proud granddaughter of his couldn\u2019t take this heavy setback and had actually attempted suicide.Jun Wu Xie remained silent.Commit suicide? I don\u2019t think so.After inheriting all the memories of this body, Wu Xie was clearer than anyone else that it definitely wasn\u2019t suicide. The reason she left Lin Palace was simply because three days ago the second prince had arranged to meet up with her.As the previous Wu Xie was depressed that she did not have any contractual spirit, when her beloved second prince asked to meet up with her she had agreed in a heartbeat. She yearned to be consoled by her beloved prince.When she arrived at the appointed place, in place of her handsome prince stood a mysterious masked man in black instead.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If it weren\u2019t for those trees growing by the cliff breaking her fall, she wouldn\u2019t have had this second chance in life.Not suicide, but homicide.Jun Wu Xie\u2019s mind quickly pondered on the situation. Whether that masked man in black was the second prince himself did not matter. This definitely was related to him one way or another.Jun Xian had contributed greatly to the expansion of the State of Qi\u2019s borders with his elite troops \u2013 the Rui Lin army. No one else wanted to get tangled with them unless they were courting death! Even the current Emperor is polite towards Jun Xian.His Majesty still treats Lin Palace with extra care but the decline of the Jun family is apparent. Jun Xian had two sons, but one died and the other was disabled leaving only a wastrel Jun Wu Xie who only knew how to keep her nose in the clouds. The future of the Jun family looked bleak.It can be said that today\u2019s Lin Palace is just a paper tiger, the main powerhouse Jun Xian was already over seventy years old.After all he\u2019s been through so much especially since after that great war which caused him to lose his eldest son and crippled his younger son, all the hards.h.i.+ps had contributed to Jun Xian\u2019s health deteriorating coupled with occasional bouts of illnesses and his age, he feared didn\u2019t have much time left. As of late, the royal family is acting more blatantly towards the Lin palace.Jun Wu Xie\u2019s encounter could very well be the designs the Royal family had towards the Lin Palace.\u2018It\u2019s obvious that the second prince no longer holds the Lin Palace in regards and even dared to act so brazenly.\u2019 The black cat muttered. At first it had thought that its master was reborn into a good home, but did not expect her to be embroiled in such a situation where she still had to fight for her own survival.Jun Wu Xie raised her eyebrow slightly.The small black cat immediately curled into a ball, burying its head between its pair of furry paws.Seeing that his granddaughter was silent, most probably still feeling scared, Jun Xian did not nag any further. He looked lovingly at Wu Xie and said: \u201cIt\u2019s alright, as long as you are back, take a good rest, if you need anything, call your brother.\u201dBrother?Jun Wu Xie searched through the memories yet she did not find any \u201cbrother\u201d. Jun Xian had only two sons, the eldest son was her father, while her mother had died soon after she gave birth to Jun Wu Xie. In that fateful war, she had lost her father in the b.l.o.o.d.y battlefield and her uncle was gravely injured and had became a cripple.\u201cWu Yao, come in and take care of your sister, I\u2019m heading out for awhile.\u201d Jun Xian called out.The door was pushed open and a tall man\u2019s figure could be seen.She looked at her \u201cbrother\u201d in amazement.Exquisite handsome face just like G.o.d\u2019s most perfect work, that magnetic pair of eyes as dark as night.\u201cYes.\u201d The man smiled.Jun Xian nodded with satisfaction, he repeatedly nagged at Wu Xie to rest before he left this pair of siblings alone.On one end of the room stood Jun Wu Xie and at the other end stood a dazzlingly striking Wu Yao.The next moment, a black shadow flashed by Wu Xie\u2019s body and in front of Wu Xie stood a black cat fiercely guarding her as it stood by the bed with it\u2019s small mouth slightly curled up revealing it\u2019s sharp teeth as it hissed.Jun Wu Yao casually looked at the small hissing figure while he leisurely walked over and slowly pulled out the chair as he sat down on the chair and crossed his legs, his gaze finally landed on Jun Wu Xie.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Lin Palace never had a Jun Wu Yao In the family registrar. That man sitting in the chair was that very man she had saved from the cave that day but the only difference was that pair of deep purple eyes were now black as obsidian.\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d She asked with a frosty expression as she stared menacingly into his eyes.Jin Wu Yao gave her a casual side glance as he propped his chin and raised his eyebrows slightly and curled his lips upwards in a teasing fas.h.i.+on as he stared back at this presumptuous girl.\u201cRepaying my grat.i.tude.\u201d He replied.\u201cNo need.\u201d She retorted.\u201cUnfortunately, the choice is not yours.\u201d he threw her an enigmatic smile.Jun Wu Xie furrowed her eyebrows. This man is dangerous! What method he did he use to make even the great Lin w.a.n.g acknowledge him as his own grandson?\u201cWhat did you do to the people of my Lin palace?\u201dJun Wu Yao faintly smiled at her and lifted his hands to reveal a small hair-like snake coiled around his finger tips. Don\u2019t be afraid, I just let these little things into their body and temporarily tweaked a little of their memory. I will not hurt anybody here, you can rest a.s.sured.The black cat was completely shocked.What kind of demon did its master save this time? Also those black hair-like snake creatures had its instincts on high alert! They were not to be trifled with! They can enter a human\u2019s body and can even alter people\u2019s memories?\u201cIs this kitten your contracted spirit?\u201d He asked as he looked on amusingly while studying the various expressions on the black cat.\u201cThat has nothing to do with you.\u201d She sneered.\u201cWhy are you so cold towards me,\u00a0my dear Sister?\u201d He chuckled.\u201cThis place is not for you, it\u2019s time for you to leave.\u201d She stated. Her inner thoughts were in turmoil. This man was too dangerous. Nothing good will happen with him staying on in the Lin Palace.Just as Jun Wu Yao lowered his voice and smiled, a sudden surge of power could be felt as those black hair-like snakes started dancing wildly on his fingertips. \u201cDon\u2019t be so heartless , you saved me, all I want is to exact vengeance on my enemies. If you can\u2019t even accede to this humble little request of mine, then I can only destroy these little things in the body of those of your Lin Palace. It\u2019s just that\u2026 If these were forcibly destroyed from within, I\u2019m afraid they may suffer\u2026I wonder what will become of the Lin Palace?\u201d\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes.\u201cNope, this is a request.\u201d he replied as he curled his lips upwards.Request? If she did not agree, he would kill everyone? This is considered a request?\u201cDon\u2019t be so nervous, it\u2019s just that I have temporarily nowhere to go to, when the time comes, I will naturally leave. Before leaving I would also like to repay your kindness. I can a.s.sure you, I won\u2019t hurt anyone here.\u201d Jun Wu Yao said with a smile.\u201cWon\u2019t you kill everyone off when you leave?\u201d She asked in a chilling voice.\u201cI won\u2019t, when it\u2019s time to leave, I can promise you that I won\u2019t harm anyone.\u201d He patiently replied.\u201cIt\u2019s not as if I have a choice\u201d she icily said as she gritted her teeth.Jun Wu Yao shrugged.Knowing that she can\u2019t get rid of this dangerous man for the time being, she simply closed her eyes to rest and no longer paid him any attention.The little black cat was a.s.sured that no harm will come upon its master for the moment. It let out a small sigh of relief as it nimbly leaped onto the bed and curled up at the edge of Wu Xie\u2019s pillow, but it maintained it\u2019s vigilance as its pair of watchful eyes never once left the man sitting on the chair.This man is very very dangerous. He\u2019s the most dangerous person it has ever encountered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Since the heavens had blessed him, he would definitely regain all that was lost. Before he exacted this vengeance of his, he needed to rebuild his strength back to its peak. Meeting this interesting little girl along the way might relieve his boredom. She was unlike those other boring people. Staying here would be entertaining.Over the next couple of days, all sorts of rare pills and potions were being sent into her room. While all the best doctors in the country were summoned for Jun Wu Xie\u2019s treatment.If she had a choice she would have seeked to treat herself.Looking at the treatment those white-haired doctors were administering, Wu Xie was trembling with anger within. They were quacks! They were all quacks!If it was her, such injuries would have been easily treated within 10 days but from the mouths of these \u2018doctors\u2019 all of them reported the healing period of not less than one month.As her injuries were too serious for her to tend to herself, she didn\u2019t have any choice but to patiently bear through the month.During this period, her Grandfather dropped by to visit her Everyday to check on her recovery. Wu Yao rarely visited.When she had finally recovered enough to walk on her own, Wu Yao appeared at the door.\u201cYou are finally looking much better\u201d he chortled as he leaned against the door and flashed her a devilish grin.\u201cI\u2019m going to change clothes\u201d Jun Wu Xie expressionlessly glanced at him \u2013 all with a single meaning. Scram.Unfortunately\u2026someone did not seem to get the hint.Rather than going away, he actually strode over to Wu Xie\u2019s side and raised his hands and gently lifted her up.The black cat\u2019s fur stood on ends.Release it\u2019s owner you beast! It screamed out in it\u2019s head.\u201cSister has not completely healed yet, it\u2019s very inconvenient for you.

It\u2019s master was being taken of such a huge advantage! And yet she had no response? Now it\u2019s not the time to be in a daze!

He was wearing a pale blue robe, but he was seated on a wheelchair. \u00a0It was such a pity that such a good man, turned out to be a cripple.To his right sat man wearing a light yellow robe, handsome face with an air of arrogance. Next to him was an elegant beauty dressed in white.\u201cPlease wait for a while Second Prince, Wu Xie has not fully recovered hence she would take some time to come over.\u201d The man in the wheelchair politely informed his guests. He was none other than the youngest son of Jun Xian \u2013 Jun Qing.Second Prince Mo Xuan Fei nodded with an indifferent expression. Although he was Jun Wu Xie\u2019s fiance, during this whole period, this was actually his first time coming round to visit. What\u2019s more, he even brought along another woman.Jun Qing\u2019s face naturally did not look good.Soon, Jun Wu Yao came to the hall.Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s indifferent att.i.tude dispersed immediately as he creased his forehead.Mo Xuan Fei can be said to be one of the best looking men in the entire State of Qi, but now his fianc\u00e9e Jun Wu Xie, was carried out by a man far surpa.s.sing his own league.As Wu Xie was still recuperating, she had lost her former rosy little face. It was now slightly pale, which made her features exude a feeling, like a blooming white lotus. She was quietly nestled in the arms of a strange man. Her former domineering att.i.tude was replaced with a delicate and charming demeanor.Mo Xuan Fei did not like Jun Wu Xie, this was a well-known fact known throughout the entire State of Qi. Their promised marriage was only due to fear of antagonising Lin w.a.n.g as he had complete control on his Rui Lin Army.But this does not mean that Mo Xuan Fei was happy to see his fiancee make a cuckold of him!\u201cAnd this is?\u201d Mo Xuan Fei asked with a deep frown.\u201cThis is Jun Wu Yao, Wu Xie\u2019s brother\u201d, Jun Qing subconsciously answered.\u201cWhat?\u201d Mo Xuan Fei expression changed for the worst. Lin Palace third generation only had one person, where did this Jun Wu Yao appear from?Does that mean that Lin w.a.n.g had long taken precautions against the Royal family and actually concealed such an important fact?Mo Xuan Fei eyes slightly narrowed.\u201cNo Wu Yao is an orphan, brought up by my father who had picked him up and raised him outside. This time as Wu Xie was seriously injured, with father\u2019s poor health and I am of no help, we decided to call Wu Yao back to take care of her.\u201d Jun Qing replied.They had no blood relations. Mo Xuan Fei heaved a sigh of relief. From the beginning, Mo Xuan Fei did not care about Jun Wu Xie.Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie slowly settled into their seats. She gave the opposite couple a casual glance, and secretly sneered. So this was the man the original owner was so fascinated with. However she had no recollection of the woman seated next to him.\u201cImperial Father learned that Wu Xie is injured, so he sent some tonics over. Qiao Yun happened to be around and I asked her to come by and take a look at the injury. Qiao Yun is a skilled medical doctor and it\u2019s better that she had a look to make sure you recover well. \u201cHis indifferent expression had already returned however whenever he mentioned that woman, he would affectionately look at her. That look was as though he was looking at his own sweetheart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They are well renowned through the continents and had remained undisputed in the field of medicine for generations.They\u00a0have a long history of producing geniuses, each whose name had fame that could shake the entire continent. The most famed was their Sovereign who has the ability akin to a saint, garnering \u00a0every kingdoms\u2019 respect. The State of Qi will definitely be on the losing end if they angered the Qing Yun Clan.Yun Xian\u00a0was the Sovereign\u2019s disciple which meant that her status in the clan was quite high\u00a0.After Mo Xuan\u00a0Fei had introduced her, Bai Yun Xian lifted her chin up slightly and her features could be seen clearer and it was of\u00a0an otherworldly appearance.\u201cI spent a lot of effort to invite Yun Xian over. Furthermore,\u00a0Wu Xie has no contracted spirit. If she doesn\u2019t heal well, what will become of her? Although we are not destined for each other, no matter what, as an acquaintance or even a friend, I should also help her. \u201cMo Xuan Fei finally conveyed his intentions.Jun Qing\u2019s face was black as coal.Previously Mo Xuan Fei had taken Jun Wu Xie as his\u00a0fiancee, entirely due to Lin Palace\u2019s military power, but now he had nothing to fear as he found an even stronger backing.Even Jun Xian\u2019s military power,\u00a0no matter how big, is not Qing Yun Clan\u2019s\u00a0opponent.Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s\u00a0purpose was very clear, he wanted to break this marriage engagement!\u201cDoes this mean that\u00a0Second Prince wants to break your engagement with our Wu Xie?\u201d Jun Qing\u2019\u00a0was\u00a0gripping the wheelchair so hard his knuckles turned white.\u201cThis is quite upsetting,\u00a0although I have no feelings towards Wu Xie, since I had gained her affection, I wanted to try to get along and see if we could progress further. But it\u2019s been so long, I really do not harbour any\u00a0feelings towards her\u00a0and it\u2019s been\u00a0determined that she has no contractual spirit. We are not destined for each other. \u201d\u00a0Mo Xuan Fei patiently explained.How can he marry such a spoiled and haughty girl who did not even have a contractual spirit? No matter what he was was a Prince of a nation! How could he marry a waste and become a laughing stock?He did not care about\u00a0Jun Wu Xie and\u00a0had thoroughly humiliated her by bringing out her infatuation with\u00a0him as well as her status as a waste.He had completely pushed the blame to her and wiped his slate clean.Jun Qing\u2019s already ashen face, silently cursed himself and\u00a0blamed own uselessness. Due to his\u00a0disability, others are bullying his niece in his own home\u00a0yet\u00a0he could do nothing at all to protect what\u2019s precious to him.Has Lin Palace declined so much?Jun Qing could not bear to see Wu Xie\u2019s forlorn expression. Knowing how much she was smitten with Mo Xuan Fei, with her\u00a0arrogant temper, and now she was\u00a0insulted by that very man she had pinned for, how she can stand it?However, what he saw left him stunned.Instead of a drama unfolding before his eyes, what he saw was entirely different from his expectations. \u00a0Jun Wu Xie with an aloft and indifferent aura, casually glanced at Mo Xuan Fei and Bai Yun Xian.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was beyond their expectations.When she wanted the engagement, she desperately did every single thing in her power, even to the extent of abusing her grandfather\u2019s position to corner him into agreeing. However now that he himself had announced the annulment, she acted as though it had nothing to do with her.\u201cJun Wu Xie, let\u2019s go our separate ways. Let Yun Xian heal you and we\u2019ll owe each other nothing henceforth.\u201d Mo Xuan Fei furrowed his eyes as he couldn\u2019t read her. What was she scheming this time round?Jun Wu Xie cast a glance at Yun Xian and she looked at her from head to toe as if appraising an item and her lips curved into a gentle smile.\u201cThe world is a vast place, why don\u2019t you go out and have a look?\u201d Jun Wu Xie asked in a playful tone.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Mo Xuan Fei was puzzled.Jun Wu Yao simply chuckled. \u201cI think she meant it\u2019s time for you to scram.\u201d his eyes slightly teary, trying hard to hold back his laughter as he very \u2018kindly\u2019 offered them her explanation.Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s face instantly became livid. \u201cJun Wu Xie, even if you do not agree to the annulment of our engagement you have to. Imperial Father has already prepared the edict and it would be announced to the whole world tomorrow.\u201dBai Yun Xian who was quiet all this time finally softly spoke out. \u201cMiss Jun, my master once said that all life will eventually end. Some things can\u2019t be forced. In your current predicament, it is not wise for you to further pursue this marriage.\u201d She \u2018kindly\u2019 offered her advice guised with an undertone of arrogance.In short, do not be shameless and stick to Mo Xuan Fei.\u201cHow dare she! Master! This woman is berating you!\u201d Little black cat was fuming at this adulterous couple.\u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d Jun Wu Xie gave an exaggerated look of fatigue and didn\u2019t to even bother to cast her glance at the couple although they were directly in her line of sight. She turned and looked over at Wu Yao.Jun Wu Yao stood up naturally, stretched his hands out as he scooped Wu Xie\u2019s pet.i.te body into his arms and left the hall without looking back.Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s face got uglier by each second. Jun Wu Xie had never ignored him before but today, she practically ignored his existence.\u201cIt\u2019s getting late already, dear guests, please return.\u201d Jun Qing said coldly. If not for their special ident.i.ties, he would have kicked them out long ago!Mo Xuan Fei was about to say something but Bai Yun Xian stood up with a hint of dissatisfaction. He swallowed whatever he was about to say and could only follow quietly as she stormed out.In the quiet hall, Jun Qing\u2019s face was as white as sheet. When did Lin Palace need to tolerate such insults? Looking at how things are progressing, with his aging father and no suitable successor to the Rui Lin Army, the Royal family is starting to act out their thoughts. From Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s actions today, it can be seen that the Royal family no longer held the Lin palace in any regards.\u2026\u2026\u2026Whilst carrying Wu Xie in his arms, Wu Yao had on a playful smile.\u201cYou\u2019re not angry?\u201d He lowered his gaze and looked at her. It was clear as day that the Second Prince had purposely brought his new love to visit with bad intentions.However not a trace of anger could be seen.She raised her head slightly. Staring at him was a pair of eyes as calm as night filled with question marks.Jun Wu Yao could not help but his smiled deepened as his crescent eyes revealed a faint glint. No one could fathom what he was on his mind.\u201cWu Xie, you really have a good temper.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No matter how much Mo Xuan Fei tried to coax her, she simply ignored him.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t you who had requested me, do you think I would have even stepped into that place? Who does she think she is?\u201d Bai Yun Xian huffed as she bit her lower lip. As Qing Yun Clan Sovereign\u2019s disciple, the number of people seeking her was as long as a dragon, however on the account of Mo Xuan Fei despite her own reluctance she still went over. The result? She was driven out! She had never suffered from such humiliation before.\u201cYun Xian, why waste your energy over a waste?\u201d he cajoled her.\u201cNo matter what, you are a prince! By lowering your head in front of another\u2026you\u2026.\u201d Sneered Bai Yun Xian.Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s face flushed with embarra.s.sment.\u201cDo not be angry, I will definitely take revenge for you.\u201d Appeasing her was the key.Sure enough, after hearing those words of his, Bai Yun Xian\u2019s expression was slightly better.\u201cDon\u2019t forget this promise of yours.\u201d She peeked over at him.\u201cDefinitely, I won\u2019t make any empty promises.\u201d Mo Xuan Fei heaved a sigh of relief.To cheer her up, Mo Xuan Fei did not directly head back to the palace. Instead, they travelled in the carriage with a team of guards and went out of town to sightsee. Only when she finally revealed a smiling face after watching the sunset at the famed \u2018Sea of Flowers\u2019 did they head back to the city.On their way back, in the carriage Mo Xuan Fei was holding onto Yun Xian\u2019s hands as they leaned on each other.The carriage came to an abrupt stop. The carriage was travelling at a relatively fast pace and when it was stopped so suddenly, they almost fell out of the carriage.\u201cWhy did you stop!\u201d bellowed Mo Xuan Fei.But no one responded to his question.As he went out to reprimand them, he could see a silhouette of a person quietly standing in front of the entourage as the darkness of the night enveloped him. The light from the flames of the torches could not reach his face.\u201cWho is there?\u201d Mo Xuan Fei asked with a guarded expression. By this time, Bai Yun Xian had also stepped out of the carriage.The team at the front watched the stranger cautiously as they watched him slowly raised his slightly opened hands when he suddenly clenched his fist.Instantly all the bodyguards\u2019 bodies burst at the same time, splattering blood everywhere.\u201cAaahhhhhhhh!\u201d \u00a0Bai Yun Xian let out a shrill scream as the b.l.o.o.d.y remains splattered onto her beautiful skirt.The fire torches all fell to the ground, turning their surrounding into a wall of fire. In the middle of it all were two frightened figures closely huddled together.Watching the ring of fire, a lone figure took a step back. \u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t have a good temper.\u201d He whispered under the moonlight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What happened today only showed that Lin Palace could not hold out much longer. The Royal Palace actions is clearly getting out of hand.\u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d Jun Wu Xie casually replied.This world was not the same as her past life, though Lin Palace was slowly crumbling, it was still the safest haven.Even though she was an expert in medicine, she can\u2019t change the fact that the current her was physically very weak, in this strange world there are too many dangers lurking around.\u201cLin Palace\u2019s main power is Jun Xian, since I\u2019m here, I will not let him die so easily.\u201d Jun Wu Xie eyebrow raised her eyebrows slightly, whoever she wanted to protect, she would not fail at it.\u201cThis body\u2019s const.i.tution is too poor, even lacking a contractual spirit, if I had one I would be able to survive better in this world.\u201d\u2018What is a contractual spirit?\u2019\u00a0The black cat knew nothing of this world.Jun Wu Xie raised her right hand, and showed it her ring finger.Slender fingers, soft and smooth\u00a0like white jade.Normally upon reaching the age of fourteen, a ring will appear on the right hand\u2019s ring finger but there was nothing on hers.\u201cMeow?\u201d Black Cat held onto her slender fingers with its furry paws, clinging onto her slender fingers and gently licked the finger she stuck out.Suddenly it constricted its pupils!\u2018Master, there seems to be a strange power on your finger, are you sure it is not a contractual spirit?\u00a0\u2019The black cat could sense a small trace of spiritual fluctuations.Jun Wu Xie eyebrow raised her eyebrows slightly, stroking her right hand\u2019s ring finger, she could not see anything, but when her fingers grazed past she could feel a strange surge of spiritual fluctuations surrounding her fingertips.\u00a0Her heart was beating with excitement as she felt the power converging around her ring finger.There was a sudden burst of brilliance which illuminated the whole room!A white lotus enveloped in a silvery white light was floating in mid-air.\u2018A flower? \u2018 The pair of black eyes blinked a few times and looked over at Jun Wu Xie hesitatingly.Contractual spirits species are divided into two types \u2013 they can either turn into weapons or morph into mighty beasts.But Wu Xie\u2019s spirit turned out to be a white lotus \u2026\u2026Plant contractual spirits were really unheard of.Jun Wu Xie carefully reached out as the white lotus slowly landed on her palm.As she was slowly studying the lotus, there was a knock on the door.At that moment, the white lotus disappeared without a trace.\u201cCome in.\u201d\u00a0she answered impatiently.Jun Wu Yao stepped in as he lazily leaned against the door, hands holding a bowl of medicine.\u201cTime to take your medicine.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Jun Wu Xie continued sipping the medicine.As Jun Wu Yao carried the empty bowl away, as soon as he left the room, his smile faded, raising his hand he sniffed his sleeve, a very faint smell of blood.Earlier on, he was careful not to get any bloodstains on himself.\u201cIt seems that next time, I must take a bath first.\u201d Frivolous smile appeared once again on Jun Wu Yao\u2019s handsome face, dark eyes so deep that reflected no traces of any emotion.\u2026\u2026The second morning, the news spread like wildfire in the Imperial City.Last night, on his way back from the \u2018Sea of Flowers\u2019, the Second Prince and his entourage was attacked by a mysterious group and all his guards were annihilated. Second Prince had a b.l.o.o.d.y battle with the enemy and only managed to protect the life of his own and a beauty, this matter has enraged the Emperor who had ordered a thorough investigation of the matter, putting a huge bounty on the culprits who had dared to a.s.sa.s.sinate the Prince.There was a huge outburst within the Imperial city walls. There were many discussions going around the grapevine. Everybody was talking about it.Everyone knows that the Second Prince and the Lin Palace\u2019s Jun Wu Xie have an arranged marriage. However that night when the Second Prince was attacked, that beauty whom he saved was not his fianc\u00e9e Jun Wu Xie! This meant that earlier that day he had gone with another woman to the \u2018Sea of Flowers\u2019.Jun Wu Xie was a tyrant!Everyone knows that Lin Palace Miss was extremely rude and arrogant, always stirring trouble in the city.People cannot help but speculate that the attack on the Second Prince was none other than Jun Wu Xie. After all, her fiance went out with another woman, a normal woman cannot stand for this, let alone the tyrannical nature of Jun Wu Xie?In only one morning, the Imperial City was in chaos, the Second Prince was unwilling to endure the outrageous tyrannical Jun Wu Xie and secretly went out with a beauty however she found out about it and had sent the Rui Lin Army to go undercover and to kill the Second Prince and his new love.There rumours went about as if those they were the ones who witnessed it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, with the arranged marriage dissolved at such timing only proved one thing, they were definitely related!Within the Imperial City, Jun Wu Xie\u2019s reputation had hit a bottom low. After the rumours spread, she was said to be the most vicious woman at the tip of everyone\u2019s tongue. Many women, who were also smitten by the Second Price\u2019s handsome looks, berated her actions endlessly.All these chaos enveloped the perimeter of Lin Palace walls. Inside, all was tranquil. She cooped herself up in her room, busy studying her own white lotus contractual spirit.In the Lin Palace study, Jun Xian was enraged, suppressing the urge to tear the Imperial edict up into shreds. \u201cGood! Very good! Now that I\u2019m old and useless, everyone thinks they can bully my granddaughter!\u201d His clenched his teeth as he gripped the edict tightly in his hands.Jun Qing had told him of the previous day\u2019s happenings and although he expected the imperial edict to arrive sooner or later, he didn\u2019t think it would have been at such a crucial timing. Receiving the edict at such time will only let the rumours run amok with speculations that Jun Wu Xie had a hand in the attack.Although Jun Xian knew his granddaughter had an arrogant att.i.tude, he knew she didn\u2019t have the guts to kill anyone. Not to mention she was at home throughout the whole time to recuperate, she hadn\u2019t left the house even once, how could she have engaged anyone to attack Mo Xuan Fei?The chaotic grapevine even involved the Rui Lin army saying that she had engaged them to help her with her little revenge. How was this even possible? Despite his excessive fawning over her and although the Rui Lin Army was his own troops, he had an upright and strict character. Not once had he ever let her be in contact with the troops, let alone give her precedence over such a great power.Mo Xuan Fei had yet to recover from the shock of the attack and yet the edict was sent out. This couldn\u2019t help but make others think that the Lin Palace was involved in this and rendered a great black mark towards the Lin Palace.\u201cFather, are we going to tell her all these things that are happening?\u201d Jun Qing\u2019s sullen face was apparent. He hated the fact that he was crippled and he had no power to protect his family.Jun Xian shook his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell her anything! Knowing her temper, what kind of ruckus would she cause? Also her body has not fully healed. His Majesty has appointed me to lead the investigations of the attack on the Second Prince. I will find out the truth and clear her name of all charges!\u201d After serving his country loyally for so many years, this was what he was repaid with. His two sons were sacrificed in the process, one died in battle, while the other was crippled.He only had his precious granddaughter left but with the Imperial decree, it washed her reputation down the drain. Who else would dare to marry her after such treatment by the Royal family?\u201cHis Majesty, you are really very heartless.\u201d Jun Xian whispered as he closed his eyes wearily.It was apparent that the Lin Palace had not much hope for the future, but they even wanted to involve his only granddaughter in this power struggle.Jun Qing lowered his head in silence and bit his lower lip as he unconsciously clenched his hands on his pair of wasted legs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What was suffering, what was despair \u2013 she had a thorough grasp on them.However, the \u2018Grandfather\u2019 of this body was like a sunlight piercing through the darkness. When she had first met him, he had poured out overwhelming love and concern which she had no idea how to react to.This was something that she has never experienced before. Whenever he found something interesting, the first thing he did was to send it to her room. If she had a slight frown on her face, he would try all means and ways to coax her.Subconsciously, she started to avoid contact with him as she did not how to respond to him as the memory of her \u2018grandfather\u2019 was completely different.But she did not think that he would have done things for her to this extent.Also Lin Palace has been suspicious towards the Royal family\u2019s schemes but had turned a blind eye to it as he had sworn his loyalty and believed that all the years of service he had rendered wouldn\u2019t be overlooked. But this time, with the spearhead pointing towards his granddaughter the blind loyalty dissipated.For his granddaughter, he was willing to give up everything.With her faint heart still throbbing, she squeezed her skirt tightly.\u201cAre all \u2018Grandfathers\u2019 supposed to be like that?\u201d she asked with furrowed brows.Standing beside her Jun Wu Yao was looking at her pale little face and he did not know why her face suddenly flushed with excitement.\u201cDo you still want to go in?\u201d he asked as he looked at her curiously.\u201cNo.\u201d she shook a head as her usually calm expression had a glimmer of warmth.

Somehow she had always felt that whenever she smelled this scent, her blood flow deemed smoother, as though this scent had a relation to this feeling.This lotus fragrance is very strange, it has a very enticing smell and an even conditions the human blood, perhaps this lotus might have other uses as well.As she reached out to pull off a petal\u2026 at that moment\u2026before the petal was pulled off\u2026\u201cOuch! Pain\u2026Pain\u2026Pain\u2026\u201d A gentle child like voice sounded out as her surroundings turned misty.When the mist gradually dispersed, a small little boy was sitting on the floor tearfully holding his arm, looking dejectedly at Jun Wu Xie.\u201cMeow!\u201d The sudden appearance of this little kid scared the black cat out of its wits and it almost fell off as it scrambled to sit back on Jun Wu Xie\u2019s shoulders.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Jun Wu Xie looked on speechlessly at the small milky white doll-like boy seated on the floor. He was wearing a small bib with a vivid white lotus design which looks exactly like her white lotus contractual spirit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This guy is definitely a monster!\u201d The black cat felt almost numb. Ever since they transversed into this world, the variety of bizarre things have happened so much.When the little boy heard the cat said that he should be thrown out he immediately started crying.\u201cI am not a monster, you cannot throw me out! I\u2019m your contractual spirit! Contractual spirit! How could you throw out your own contractual spirit \u2026\u2026\u201d the sobbing little boy claimed, while looking at Jun Wu Xie, big tears from his eyes were falling when suddenly, the room was infused with a deep lotus scent.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that contractual spirits could turn into humans?\u201d Jun Wu Xie reb.u.t.ted harshly, her gorgeous face not a trace of softening up.Little boy opened his mouth, looked at Jun Wu Xie as if wronged.\u201cI really am your contractual spirit, if you do not believe me, I can change into a more familiar form for you.\u201d Then it slowly stood up, stifling its tears when he disappeared without a trace, in his place, a beautiful white lotus was floating in mid-air.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Jun Wu Xie no longer knew how to express the shock in her mind.*Poof* The white lotus disappeared once again and the little boy once reappeared in the same place.For that moment, Jun Wu Xie thought of the magicians in her previous world.\u201cNow do you believe me?\u201d The little guy was watching Jun Wu Xie\u2019s response in earnest.Although \u2026\u2026 he also knows that even in the spirit world, he was different from the rest\u2026 but he really is \u2026\u2026 a contractual spirit!Jun looked leisurely at her own \u201ccontractual spirit\u201d white lotus flower which was already hard to accept as it was the first she had heard of a plant contractual spirit but now that it could even transform\u2026! However, looking at the little arm and legs, not to mention the fighting, if others gave him a punch, it would most probably put him to death almost immediately.\u201cSure enough, it\u2019s still useless?\u201d Jun Wu Xie muttured out loud, frowning slightly not hiding her discontent that this was not her ideal contractual spirit.Brooding Jun Wu Xie did not notice, after she carelessly said those words, the already uneasy little lotus was again on the verge of tears.\u201cSniff \u2026please do not turn me away, I\u2019m..I\u2019m useful\u2026I\u2019m really useful.\u201d Alert to his own master\u2019s \u201cloath\u201d the little lotus could no longer bear it, he threw himself at her while clinging onto one leg, tears running like a tap.\u201cI am very useful, really, do not throw me back.\u201d Little Lotus stubbornly clinging to her leg, fearing her outright rejection.\u201cThrow back?

No known method except in the event of death, can separate them.One can only form a bond with one contractual spirit for life, so no matter how useless her own contractual spirit is, she has no other choice in the matter and even more so to throw it out.\u201cThe Spirit World\u201d little lotus bitterly replied.\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re from?\u201d This was the first time she\u2019s heard of this place.Little Lotus nodded, as if afraid of Jun Wu Xie disliking him, in a well-behaved manner he added: \u201cBefore the awakening, the contractual spirit will stay in the spirit world, if the person dies, we will go back there again. That place is terrifying, I\u2019ve just managed to escape, please, do not throw me back, OK? \u201dShe\u2019d like to, but can do that?\u201cI \u2026\u2026 I can prove to be useful, please wait!\u201d A sudden determination seemed to have possessed little lotus when he finally let go of her leg, his small frail body quivering as he stood up, lifted his tender little arm straight out in front of Jun Wu Xie.\u201cAh?\u201d Jun Wu Xie asked with big innocent eyes looking at him.Little Lotus snorted, his tender little face with a painful expression looking at her, he mustered up his courage and finally shouted: \u201cEat!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d What\u2019s there to eat?\u201cI am a special lotus, if you eat my petals, it can purify your blood and remove all impurities within it.\u201d Little lotus declared with vigor and pride.Jun Wu Xie eyes lit up when she heard that. No one knew better than her, how rare was it to purify one\u2019s blood? Even if a medicine is amazing, there was still a limit. To be able to condition the human body and to improve the physique was possible to truly cleanse the body of all impurities was akin to being reborn!In her previous world, despite technology and medicine being very well developed, many Scientists were still researching genes and how they affect the human body, but still have not found any suitable methods.If what little lotus claimed was true, then he really is important!In order to determine if little lotus was speaking the truth, Jun Wu Xie held onto his little tender arm\u2026although she knew the little guy in front of her was in fact a white lotus, the appearance of him in human form made it difficult for her to act any further. She brought his arm to her lips and looked at him, he was already bawling with huge teardrops falling.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dShe really wasn\u2019t a Monster.Softly sighing, she put his tender little arm down.Although the the little lotus was \u2018determined\u2019 to be useful to his master, when he saw that she had put his arms to Her lips he couldn\u2019t control his own fear and tears started falling on its own. When the expected pain did not come, he had mixed feelings \u2013 he was really very happy not to be eaten but\u2026 The owner will feel that he is really useless and abandon him.\u201cI\u2026I am really not afraid of pain,\u201d little lotus weakly declared.Jun Wu Xie glanced over to his red and watery eyes.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Little lotus was instantly discouraged.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hence, he had reverted back to his useless status.\u201cAh! I have this!\u201d Little lotus suddenly exclaimed as he touched his little ap.r.o.n and held out his small clenched fist.He slowly opened his hand revealing five small seed quietly lying on his palm.\u201cWhat are these?\u201d Jun Wu Xie asked.\u201cThese are lotus seeds!\u201d Little lotus blinked a few times.\u201cAlthough the effect isn\u2019t as great as eating the petals, consuming it can strengthen the bones, purify the bone marrow though its unable to renew the tendons and flesh.\u201d he slowly trailed off.\u2018Only five?\u201d Jun Wu Xie raised her eyebrows. Having such an effect is pretty good too.\u201cI\u2019m left with five for now. I can produce one once a month, the others ate them all up, I could only save these five seeds.\u201d Little lotus explained timidly.\u201cThey?\u201d Jun Wu Xie found it really hard to understand his manner of speaking. However once a month is still good.After keeping the five lotus seeds safely, Jun Wu Xie thought about her own little lotus. Although he had no fighting ability his ability to sense seems quite good and these lotus seeds although they are not at the same level as elixirs, it can significantly improve a person\u2019s const.i.tution. This is what she needed most now!Whether it was herself ,Jun Xian or Jun Qing, they all needed to improve their body\u2019s const.i.tution.Conditioning drugs can only achieve a certain effect, there will still however have some side effects and targeting the bones were one of the hardest to achieve. These lotus seeds have solved the first major step!With strong bones as the base, conditioning the rest of the body is simply child\u2019s play to her.With a contractual spirit meant that she could start cultivating in this new world, even tough little lotus was unable to fight, at least she could start cultivating and rely on herself!Little lotus was waiting anxiously at the side waiting for some kind of affirmation from Jun Wu Xie as it fiddled with its fingers when she finally nodded at him.Knowing that it would not be abandoned, little lotus gave a wide smile as tears started trickling down. He vowed in his heart to be a good contractual spirit and do his utmost for his new master.She started studying him in earnest as she found that various parts of his body have different effects. His flesh and blood could practically make one\u2019s physique reborn even his tears have the effect of conditioning the blood.It can be said other than its zero combat abilities, it could be considered a priceless treasure.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was specially prepared for Jun Xian and Jun Qing.Before she grew strong on her own, Lin Palace safety fell on the shoulders of the two of them.After crying so hard, the poor exhausted little lotus changed back into a barely visible ring and sat quietly on her finger.After the little harvest, Jun Wu Xie fell into a deep slumber.At the crack of dawn, she went to look for Jun Xian.Jun Xian was surprised to find his precious granddaughter look for him on her own accord. Ever since she was injured, he rarely had the chance to spend time with her, everytime he tried to interact with her, she seemed quiet and withdrawn, p.r.i.c.kling his heart.\u201cWu Xie? Why are you here? Come, sit down quickly.\u201d Jun Xian hurriedly ushered her to the nearest seat.Jun Wu Xie was treated like a treasure as she is the only in her generation, with Jun Qing\u2019s disability, having children may not be possible.She sat down meekly as she slowly warmed up to her new grandfather.\u201cGrandfather, I\u2019d like to discuss something with you.\u201d she said solemnly.Her sudden declaration made his heart skip a beat. Could she have heard all the rumours that have been going around?\u201cJust say it. Whatever you want, just name it! \u00a0As long as it is something within my means, I will do it for you.\u201d he addressed her warmly.Jun Wu Xie cleared her throat. This was her first \u2018family\u2019 formal conversation she\u2019s ever had.\u201cGrandfather already knows that I have no contractual spirit. I know that I\u2019m unable to cultivate and I\u2019ve been thinking, ever since I\u2019ve been recuperating in my room, I\u2019ve been looking through some medical books. My writing skills are not that bad and since I can\u2019t cultivate any spiritual power, I was thinking of studying medicine.\u201dHe looked at her with a shocked expression. \u00a0She&h.e.l.lip;She actually came to say something so sensible? Although he loves his granddaughter, he knows she has no skills other than brewing trouble. He sat there petrified.Jun Wu Xie saw that he was frozen in place, she persisted on: \u201cLin Palace is not as peaceful as before. After my injury, I\u2019ve come to terms with a lot of things. You don\u2019t have to worry about me, I really want to change.\u201dJun Xian remained silent, Lin Palace current predicament wasn\u2019t good even Mo Xuan Fei personally broke off the engagement shows that their standing was no longer stable.

On top of that, she even became so well behaved and sensible. This caused Jun Xian to feel conflicted and inevitably sad.After all, having him as a grandfather was useless, although she had lost both her parents since young, as her grandfather he couldn\u2019t even protect her and give her a stable life\u2026\u201cThis matter I\u2019ll leave it to you. As long as you want to, just go for it. Just remember, as long as I am around, no one can bully you.\u201d Jun Xian declared with a glint in his eyes. Jun Wu Xie\u2019s change naturally made him very happy.\u201cThank you, Grandfather\u201d she nodded.\u201cWe are family, no need for such formalities! As long as you are happy, as your grandfather, I feel at ease.\u201d If she was really interested in medicine it would be a good instead of letting her think of the scoundrel Mo Xuan Fei.\u201cI will ask the servants to prepare some medical books and herbs for you, if anything is lacking, just tell Uncle Fu.Uncle Fu was an authoritative figure in Lin Palace. He had followed Jun Xian from a young age and was second in command in the Rui Lin Army before handing down his power to Jun Wu Xie\u2019s father. After retiring from the army, he took charge of all the household matters in the Lin Palace.Before it was even lunch time, Uncle Fu sent the servants to send over medical books and herbs. Her room was quickly filled up with medical books and large boxes of medicinal herbs. Jun Xian even instructed for a room near her courtyard to be turned into pharmacy.Uncle Fu came by to check if everything was in order after which he left her room. She quickly glanced through a few books nearby. After reading a few casually, she placed them aside.Those books that were sent to her might not be top tier medical books but they were still very rare books, but once they went through her hands, she could memorise everything and even describe an even more advanced treatment than what was described in the book.She was despairing at this world\u2019s medical level after experiencing first hand through those quacks, she needed to see if the herbs and treatments if they were any different from her previous world. Although there were some similarities, her comprehension of fusing the medicine and herbs of this world and her previous world was terrifying. In one day, she fully comprehended all of it. The books recorded most of the herbs and efficiency of this world and within a short span, she had them all clearly sorted in her mind.\u201cWhen are you going to start?\u201dThe black cat walked elegantly around the pharmacy, the room was filled with the scent of nostalgia as the fragrance of herbs filled the room. It suddenly had a flashback of its master seated in a similar room surrounded by various herbs and medical books as she dabbled in various prescriptions and treatments for a decade.\u201cI\u2019m in no hurry.\u201d Jun Wu Xie calmly replied as she took little lotus out. To condition and maximise Jun Xian\u2019s and Jun Qing\u2019s potential, she must master the effects of the little lotus.The white lotus looked like a crown jewel with each petal looking like a crystal,unlike any ordinary lotus she\u2019s ever seen. She sucked in a deep breath as she savoured this beauty with her eyes.She took out a small lotus seed and swallowed it gracefully, what better way to test the effects than herself?It started off with a dull and uncomfortable pain from her bones as an itching sensation took over. She narrowed her eyes as the pain became more unbearable as the feeling changed with each minute. From a dull itching sensation to a sharp knife like pain as though someone was sharpening a knife with her bones. She was soon drenched in a thin layer of sweat as she bit her lower lip.This feeling was worse than being stabbed by a knife!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her clothes clung on to her slim body frame as she was drenched with sweat and a layer of black sticky fluid.She was finally free from the torment! She gave a sigh of relief as she looked at her hands and those impurities that were expelled out.\u201cThat little guy didn\u2019t lie.\u201d Jun Wu Xie muttered absentmindedly as she tried to feel what changes were made to her body. She could feel that her joints were more flexible and her body felt lighter as well.In this world if one wanted to cultivate their spiritual power, one needed an excellent physique. Previously she did not hurry to start cultivating as she had wanted to hone her physique to an almost perfect state before embarking on the arduous \u00a0journey ahead. Starting with a strong foundation will lead to exponential gains in the future!After experiencing all the pain and reaping the enormous benefits herself, Wu Jun Xie was convinced that she was ready to start the treatment for Jun Qing and Jun Xian. It was time to improve their const.i.tutions and put Lin Palace back in their rightful place!One of the main reasons why the Emperor dared to act so presumptuously was because Lin Palace has no successors in line. With Jun Qing crippled and the arrogant good-for-nothing Jun Wu Xie, the seemingly bleak future encouraged such acts against them.If Jun Xian and Jun Qing are in the pink of health, with their valiant vigor and aura, one would have to think twice before acting against them. With Jun Xian as the backbone of the Rui Lin Army, there can be only one outcome \u2013 blood will be shed!During this time, Jun Wu Xie spent her time scurrying to and fro her little courtyard to her pharmacy, busy conditioning her body\u2019s\u2019 physique through her diet, when her pale face finally turned a hint of rosy.Jun Xian was worried that his granddaughter would play doctor only for a short while before her interest died out, hence he was pleasantly surprised to hear that she was busy scuttling to and fro her pharmacy and felt relieved that her complexion was looking better each time he saw her.In the Imperial Palace, they still have yet to receive any action or any retaliation from the Lin Palace which made the Emperor smile. Lin Palace had chalked up too many military merits over the years. Who would pa.s.s up such a great chance like this to bring their name down? \u00a0This was the desired result he had wished for, crus.h.i.+ng them in spirit.By now, the flames of the malicious rumors of Jun Wu Xie engaging the Rui Lin Army to act on her personal selfish whims had long spread out far beyond the city\u2019s walls.All this while, Jun Xian was trying to trace and find the group of mysterious men in black and get proof to clear Jun Wu Xie\u2019s name. He had however a trace of suspicion that they were hiding something important.All the Second Prince\u2019s guards had no complete corpse, as though they had exploded from within. Also, the Second Prince was said to have been badly injured due to fighting with them and fending off their attacks, however he had not been granted any audience with the Second Prince to determine what injuries or what type of weapon had caused them.Clearly the Imperial Palace was withholding important clues to slow him down in his investigations so as to bring down Jun Wu Xie\u2019s reputation.From morning till night, Jun Xian is always out looking for clues. On the other hand, Jun Wu Yao\u2019s figure was rarely seen in the compounds of the Lin Palace. As for Lin Palace matters, only Jun Qing and Jun Wu Xie remained.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Jun Qing however was not in the mood to appreciate it.Hearing small footsteps from the side, Jun Qing turned his wheelchair in that direction and smiled as he saw a slightly flushed Jun Wu Xie.\u201cYou are finally willing to come out?\u201d Jun Qing asked feigning annoyance.Ever since Jun Xian permitted Jun Wu Xie to study medicine, she was practically a shut-in, only going to her pharmacy and nowhere else. Such an appearance was rare indeed.Jun Wu Xie looked at her Uncle who was smiling dotingly at her. She was slightly surprised as her body had undergone intensive conditioning through the special lotus seed and tears, although she has yet to cultivate any spiritual power, her footsteps have become very light. Unless she was in the person\u2019s line of sight otherwise anyone within five steps from her would not be able to discover her presence.However this time she clearly had just entered the s.p.a.cious backyard and her Uncle who was facing the lotus pond knew right from the start that it was her. His hearing was too amazing!\u201cUncle\u2019s legs were injured on the battlefield?\u201d Jun Wu Xie searched hard through the fragments of memories related to this little uncle of hers but not much information could be obtained. From her memory, Jun Qing had always been sitting on a wheelchair and had rarely talked about his legs, only once at a family feast had he mentioned that he was injured on the battlefield.\u201cYes.\u201d Jun Qing answered.\u201cIt isn\u2019t an ordinary injury, right?\u201d Jun Wu Xie pressed on as she was certain that there was more to it than a simple battle wound. When he was injured, Lin Palace was at its prime where all the superior doctors from all around would be invited to heal him.When Jun Wu Xie fell off the cliff, her injuries were very serious as well, with broken bones as one of the main bane. Within a month, she was able to walk hence a simple wound from the battlefield should not have any reason to take away his ability to walk.\u201cIt\u2019s poison, I was stabbed in the back by the enemy with a fatal poison. If not for your Grandfather, I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t have any Uncle to talk to. He was able to get Qing Yun Clan\u2019s Sovereign to heal me, \u201d he said melancholy, as he raised his hem at his waist to expose a hideous scar.Although the wound was over a decade old, there was still a trace of dark purple surrounding it.\u201cQing Yun Clan?\u201d she slightly frowned.\u201cYour Grandfather traded our family heirloom in exchange for his help.\u201d Jun Qing quickly explained and attempted to clarify as he thought of the deep enmity between Qing Yun Clan\u2019s Bai Yun Xian and his niece.Previously when Jun Wu Xie had told Jun Xian of her intentions to pursue her future in medicine, he had wanted to suggest to enrol in Qing Yun Clan as that was the mecca of medical studies in this world.Unfortunately, with Mo Xuan Fei and Bai Yun Xian\u2019s entanglement, having her join Qing Yun Clan was no longer possible.\u201cLet me look at Uncle\u2019s leg.\u201d Jun Wu Xie had never once thought of that pair of adulterers.\u201cOkay.\u201d He quickly obliged and rolled up his pants.Jun Qing\u2019s legs were pale and slender, if not for that injury, this pair of legs which were once robust and strong was now reduced to a pair of thin and weak legs. After more than a decade of not utilizing the leg muscles, they shrunk and now his upper body and legs were very out of proportion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hmmm\u2026 I wonder if Uncle likes to eat lotus seeds?\u201d She casually asked.Jun Qing gave a quick thought and replied : \u201cI do eat them occasionally.\u201d\u201cI just picked some yesterday and thought they tasted really good! Would you like to try some as well?\u201d She asked again in a casual tone.\u201cOf course I would, It\u2019s been handpicked by you.\u201d He happily agreed. His own little niece is now so sensible. If it was before, even if she ever picked any lotus seeds, the first person she would give it to would be Mo Xuan Fei!\u201cUncle open your mouth\u201d she added.Jun Qing was surprised although he didn\u2019t know what she was up to but as a doting Uncle, all he wanted was for his niece to be happy so he listened to her and opened his mouth.As soon as he did that, Jun Wu Xie immediately flicked the lotus seed into his mouth and before he could even react, she closed his mouth and tilted his head up forcing him to swallow it down.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d From her \u2018gentle feeding\u201d method, he almost choked out tears.Just when he thought she was finally getting more sensible, the way she did things was still a little\u2026.rough.Jun Wu Xie can\u2019t be blamed for crude method of feeding medicine. It\u2019s just that it was never in her genes to begin with. With regards to patients who refused to eat medications, she always had a single thought- that was to have the patient eat it and her method was crude but effective without room for resistance.\u201cIsn\u2019t it delicious?\u201d She enquired.Jun Qing looked at her with a dumbfounded expression. She simply shoved it down his throat! When did he get the luxury to taste it?\u201cMmmm.. Delicious.\u201d He coaxed her.\u201cThen I shall leave first.\u201d After doing what she came for, she whizzed away back to her courtyard.Jun Qing stared at her back as left, feeling a little baffled. This little girl came all the way here and after talking so much, it was merely to feed him a lotus seed?\u201cMaster\u2019s body still has some remnants of poison, as the lotus seed is of cooling nature, would you like me to brew a bowl of ginger soup to warm you up?\u201d The \u2018servant\u2019 who had been standing behind him all this while broke the silence. If one looked closely, this man had a tall and robust stature, with his stoic expression, one would think he resembled nothing like a servant.Jun Qing raised his hands, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to kick up a big fuss over a single lotus seed. I\u2019m not that weak.\u201dThat man no longer pursued on and said his thoughts out loud. \u201cLittle Miss seems a little different lately.\u201dEver since Jun Qing was injured, he had been tending to him for over a decade and had watched Jun Wu Xie grow up. He never had a good impression of her due to her lofty and arrogant nature hence he did not even bother to greet her when he saw her.\u201cYou think so too?\u201d Jun Qing\u2019s lips curved upwards as he gave a deep thought. With a trace of nostalgia, he absentmindedly said, \u201cSeeing her now somewhat reminds me of Brother.\u201d\u201cPlease do not jest, some things cannot be compared.\u201d That man frowned as he sternly replied, he didn\u2019t seem to agree with the words of Jun Qing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If one day Father and I are no longer around,she will be in your\u2026..\u201dBefore he could finish his sentence, an uncomfortable itch was felt as if someone was sawing his bones with a blunt knife and he hunched over as this feeling started to spread to every bone in his body.\u201cMaster!\u201d The man looked worriedly at the pale faced Jun Qing.Jun Qing\u2019s poison from that time had yet to be fully purged and the residual toxicity had penetrated deep into the bone marrow, even the famed Yun Qing Clan\u2019s Sovereign had failed to neutralise it. Over the years, Jun Qing had been very cautious right down to his diet. He was fine just a moment ago and was still rebuking him,\u00a0why did he suddenly\u2026?He suddenly thought of something.\u201cThat lotus seed? But how could it be?\u201dNo matter how much he disliked Jun Wu Xie, the blood of the Jun family still flowed within her, that\u2019s why when she had approached Jun Qing just now, he did not have any apprehension towards her. How could it have been her?Jun Qing clenched his teeth tightly as he felt the itch slowly became an indescribable pain. It was as if they were slowly being crushed and the overwhelming pain swept over him as he broke out in cold sweat.As the man watched Jun Qing\u2019s condition worsen by each pa.s.sing moment, he quickly lifted Jun Qing up with his wheelchair and rushed back to the room.All these was not relayed to Jun Wu Xue. She was cooped up in her pharmacy researching. She had not given it a second thought as she had personally gone through the bone cleansing process and although it was not the most comfortable experience, it was still manageable in her opinion.However, what she did not know was that the cleansing of a regular human bone and one that had been poisoned had a totally different effect.In a different courtyard, at this moment Jun Qing was suffering from an excruciating pain, as if a thousand knives were hacking away at his bones. An emergency summon for all the capable doctors of the State to quickly head over to Lin Palace to treat him.However, all the doctors were helpless in their diagnosed as Jun Qing lay on his bed as his body temperature soared, as his body kept twitching and soon the sweat soaked through the sheets. The sweat expelled also carried a faint black smelly substance.This scene scared the wits out of the group of doctors who knelt at the bedside quivering.Jun Xian had received the news and rushed back to see his son lying on the bed, complexion as white as sheet. His condition did not look optimistic and it was as if he had one leg in the grave already.Jun Xian broke out in cold sweat as he roared, \u201cWhat the h.e.l.l happened?!\u201d A pair of bloodshot eyes was staring viciously at the doctors kneeling by the bed.\u201cTh..thi..this humble one\u2026does not know how .. How his blood flow is in chaos and the poison in his bone marrow suddenly spread..spread to wh..whole body. Thi..this humble one really tried my best\u2026 Lin w.a.n.g please have mercy!\u201d The group of doctors all cried for mercy as they all had the same diagnosis- Jun Qing did not have long to live!This bolt of information almost made Jun Xian faint as he steadied himself.Was his last son going to die?No!This can\u2019t be happening!He immediately rushed over to the Royal Palace, intending to seek out Bai Yun Xian as she is Qing Yun Clan\u2019s Sovereign\u2019s disciple. To his dismay, Bai Yun Xian had refused audience with anyone saying that she was still frightened from the attack and was still recuperating.He immediately stormed into the Grand Hall to seek an audience with the Emperor instead.\u00a0His Majesty was placed in a difficult situation and as he did not have much of a choice, he could only watch on helplessly as he saw Jun Xian lead all the doctors in the Royal Palace back to Lin Palace to a.s.sist with the treatment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He sat there sadly as he buried his face in his hands.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201cIs that true?\u201d The Emperor who was seated in the study was listening to the doctor who was reporting Jun Qing\u2019s situation to him, his face void of any expression as he listened solemnly.\u201cThis humble one does not dare lie. Jun Qing\u2019s poison has indeed acted up and the poison has attacked the heart.\u201d The doctor reported truthfully.\u201cThat\u2019s a pity, order for the Snow Mountain Ginseng and the Red Lingzhi to be sent over to Lin Palace.\u201d The Emperor was feeling very generous, both the Snow Mountain Ginseng and the Red Lingzhi are rare herbs that was used to prolong life and it was apparent to everyone that Jun Qing has not much longer to live.\u201cYes, your Majesty.\u201d\u201cWithdraw\u201d The Emperor waved his hand.When the doctor left, the Emperor leaned back in his chair as he went through all the various scrolls on the desk, a small smile could be seen.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..In the Lin Palace was overshadowed with gloom as Jun Qing lay on his bed motionless, his breathing was very weak.Jun Xian sat by his side with red eyes.\u201cWhy did this suddenly happen? You were alright all these years, why did the poison suddenly flare up?\u201d Jun Xian could not understand, all these years his condition had been stable, what could have triggered it?The man standing by the side had on a solemn expression as he clenched his fist tightly.\u201cHas any suspicious personnel entered the Palace lately?\u201d Jun Xian asked with a deep frown.The man shook his head as he looked over at Jun Qing lying on the bed, his heart was struggling internally. Before Jun Qing fainted, he had specifically told him not to tell anyone that Jun Wu Xie was there before. No matter what had happened, he believed from the bottom of his heart that Jun Wu Xie would not hurt him. He simply took it as his life was going to end a little sooner that\u2019s all. He did not want to implicate his niece into anyone\u2019s grand scheme to throw the Lin Palace into further turmoil.But now all the doctors have diagnosed that he did not have much time left. Did he have to hide this forever?The man was conflicted, if it was anyone else, he would have directly interrogated them but the perpetrator was Jun Wu Xie!If Jun Qing really died, Lin Palace had no more future.\u201cThis\u2026what happened here?\u201d a puzzled voice suddenly sounded.The man and Jun Xian both turned to look at the same time as they saw Jun Wu Xie carrying a black cat in her arms, with a quizzical expression at the doorway.\u201cWu Xie\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Jun Xian\u2019s husky voice was full of sorrow.The man clenched his trembling fist and choked back the words he wanted to say.\u201cYour uncle has been poisoned.\u201d Jun Xian slowly broke it to her as he closed his eyes in despair.Poison? Jun Wu Xie was slightly surprised when she heard this. She immediately went to the bed ignoring the surprised Jun Xian and man as she took Jun Qing\u2019s pulse.His pulse was very weak, barely discernable. Jun Qing\u2019s face was pale and covered with sweat mixed with a dark substance. All these fit the description of being poisoned.If it was others, they would have concluded it as severe poisoning however, who was Jun Wu Xie? She had immediately found something different.Although Jun Qing\u2019s pulse was weak, it was also very stable.Jun Wu Xie immediately pulled off the quilt and removed the pillow.\u201cWu Xie, what are you doing?!\u201d\u201cUncle is fine.\u201d Jun Wu Xie\u2019s mind was focused on the treatment and did not know how her sudden actions and words had impacted the rest who were standing there with their mouth agape.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It looked as though the poison had penetrated the bone marrow, as the lotus seed actually cleanses the bones and as it purges all the toxins out, these will be purged out from the pores of the body together with the sweat. Before the process is complete, this acc.u.mulation of discarded toxins will confuse people and think that the terrifying amount of poison had actually reached his heart and hence the death verdict.In actual fact, it was not so dangerous!Jun Wu Xie placed Jun Qing on a flat position as she wanted to smoothen the detoxification process. She swiftly took out a needle bag as she pulled out a long slender needle and accurately pierced a main meridian point. She continued on with a few other points to unblock them with the intention to increase his blood circulation and to hasten the process and put an early end to his ordeal.As she was self immersed in an ethereal state as she skillfully used her needles to treat him, she was oblivious to her surroundings. When she had initially pulled out the needle, the man could not take it anymore and had stepped forward to stop her when the equally shocked Jun Xian raised his hand and blocked him.They stood beside the bed and watched her quietly as she skillfully and accurately unblocked his meridiens. They had all seen Jun Wu Xie grow up and had never expected her medical skills to be so good.\u201cPrepare ten stoves in the room and shut the door and windows.\u201d she calmly ordered.\u201cWhat are you up to? He\u2019s your Uncle! Can\u2019t you see, he\u2019s dying!\u201d The man bellowed. He could not take it any more! Jun Qing was already so sickly and his sweat had soaked through the sheets and she still wanted him to be cooped up in the room with ten stoves?!Jun Wu Xie glanced over and spoke in a cold voice, \u201cI don\u2019t speak to idiots.\u201dShe did not care about how horrid his expression was, she simply carried her black cat in her arms and left.There was nothing wrong with Jun Qing\u2019s detoxification process but his body was very weak as his lower body was immobile for too long. His internal organs were all in disarray, hence even if the bones are cleansed, she still needed to help him rebuild his whole body const.i.tution to what it was before, or even better! Now, her main goal was to purge out all the remaining toxins in the shortest time possible.She immediately rushed to get the prescription for stabilizing and boosting his internal system.In Jun Qing\u2019s room, the air was very stifled as the man\u2019s face was as black as coal while Jun Xian wore a heavy expression.As Jun Xian watched Jun Qing Ying on the bed with that deathly pale complexion, Jun Xian was struggling for a bit when he finally ordered, \u201cPrepare ten stoves! Shut the doors and all the windows tight!\u201d\u201cLin w.a.n.g, you would even let Miss mess with his life?\u201d He gave Jun Xian an incredulous look.Jun Xian sighed. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard what all the other doctors have said. They said there was no way to cure him. They have all given up on him. The fact that there is a glimmer of hope, no matter how ridiculous it is, I am going to try it. I have only one son left and I\u2019m not going to let him leave me so easily. Even if the chance is one in a million, I\u2019m going to cling onto it.\u201dHe was pushed into a corner and had no way out. He was willing to risk it all, after all, what did he have to lose?When he saw his granddaughter\u2019s skill with the needle, a glimmer of hope ignited within. He\u2019d rather place his hope within his family!\u201cYou are going to place all your hopes in her? How long has she dabbled in medicine for? This is too much! It\u2019s a life you are playing with! Isn\u2019t Qing Yun Sovereign\u2019s disciple currently residing in the Royal Palace? Even if his Majesty doesn\u2019t agree, I\u2019m going to tie her up and drag her here!\u201d He argued bitterly.Jun Xian shook his head. \u201cJun Qing\u2019s been poisoned too heavily, even the Sovereign cannot neutralize it, what more his disciple?

The sudden increase in temperature forced both Jun Xian and the man to circulate their spiritual energy and soon they were each covered in a thin cloak to protect themselves from the extreme heat.Jun Qing\u2019s sweat mixed with black substance came trickling out and he was completely drenched. It was as though he had just been fished out from a pool of water. Those sweat beads that dripped onto the floor evaporated quickly and soon the room was filled with steam.A creaking sound was heard as Jun Wu Xie entered the room with a bowl of her own concoction as the little black cat stayed by her side.Without paying heed to anyone, she marched straight up to Jun Qing.Suddenly, she felt a strong grip on her wrist. The man had rushed forward in an attempt to stop her.\u201cHe\u2019s your Uncle!\u201d He stared at her menacingly. Although he did not tell Jun Xian that the cause of this was all because she had fed him the lotus seed, he still held her responsible in his heart. Although he did not want to believe that she was out to hurt Jun Qing, the facts were right there.\u201cLet go.\u201d She said icily as she frowned. \u00a0She immediately broke free from his grasp as she flung her hand away. She was very annoyed to be interrupted and questioned repeatedly while treating a patient.The man stood quietly at the corner with a gloomy expression as he watched her slowly feed Jun Qing the bowl of black liquid.After drinking the bowl of medicine, there was no response from Jun Qing as he lay quietly on the bed.As time slowly ticked by, the intense temperature of the room was a great torture to Jun Wu Xie. As she had yet to start her cultivation much less protect herself with a cloak of her own spiritual energy from such extreme temperature. She continued to sweat profusely as her thin dress was soaked through but no matter what, she just sat there quietly as she meticulously paid attention to every single change in his pulse.The black cat leaped onto the bed as it stared at Jun Qing and looked up at Jun Wu Xie.\u201cMeow.\u201d Physical condition seems stable.Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly.An hour later, crystal clear beads of sweat started forming, a huge contrast to the previous murky sweat that was expelled.Jun Wu Xie immediately called for the servants to remove all the stoves and air the room.\u201cPrepare hot water and help freshen Second Master up.\u201d Jun Wu Qing ordered.Everyone outside the room looked at her with a puzzled expression. What was their little Miss up to again? The situation for their Second Master was already very bad with almost every doctor in the State giving him the death verdict. Now she comes in and play doctor?The servants hesitated as they looked towards Jun Xian and when he nodded, they scuttled in and went to clean up.\u201cYou there, go to my pharmacy and take the medical pot I left on the table over and add it into warm water and let Second Master soak in it for three hours.\u201d She called out to the man standing nearest to her.During this whole process, Jun Xian stood quietly by the side never once interfering with her arrangements as he watched her with his tired eyes, he felt a wave of relief wash over him.Regardless if everything she did was useless, at least she had changed for the better.After she finished all the necessary arrangements, she discovered that her dress had many stains, these were all from the black substance expelled out from Jun Qing\u2019s body and it had an odious \u00a0stench.She quickly retreated back to her own room to take a bath. She really hated all these smells!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although he was unconscious, it was apparent that his condition had improved as his breathing was no longer as weak and his face although pale, it was not deathly white as before. The man could see this but he still huffed his chest up haughtily as he still bore some grievances towards Jun Wu Xie.Jun Xian was by his son\u2019s side all this while and when he saw the improvement, he gave a sigh of relief.\u201cAfter all, Wu Xie is his daugher, she may have been somewhat naive in the past, now she is all grown up. You must not have any prejudice against her, she may\u2026 she may need the protection from you guys to grow up safely in the future.\u201d He patiently explained. He could tell that man did not like Jun Wu Xie very much. He wanted to try to diffuse the animosity as much as he could.The man remained silent and left the room as soon as he saw that Jun Qing\u2019s complexion had finally turned for the better.After her bath and changing into a fresh new set of clothes, Jun Wu Xie sat in the pharmacy as she held a tea cup in one hand while the other was writing down all the various names of herbs with fervour.Jun Qing\u2019s condition has stabilised but to return his condition to its peak, a lot of effort is needed, as such she was busy scribbling away all the medications needed.To complement the medicine, she also wrote down the list of dishes to pair them with, to complement each other so as to nourish him and speed up the process.A knocking the door interrupted her thoughts.\u201cCome in.\u201dThe door creaked opened and there stood the same tall man who had been interrupting her all these while. She furrowed her eyebrows.\u201cIf you\u2019ve got something to say, spit it out now, or else just scram.\u201d For people other than family, she does not pay any heed to the words used. She says whatever comes to mind without a care.As she just finished speaking, the man standing in front of her suddenly went down on one knee with a loud thud.\u201cMajor General of the Rui Lin Army Long Qi has greatly offended Miss, please punish me as you deem fit!\u201d He said grimly as his tall frame was kneeling with on one knee and his head slightly bowed.Rui Lin Army\u2019s Major General\u2026she glanced over at Long Qi..she had always felt that he was always staying quietly by her Uncle\u2019s side and fussing over him on quite a few occasions, although she had always thought he did not seem like a servant or a bodyguard, it never crossed her mind that he would be Rui Lin Army\u2019s Major General!But\u2026\u201cOkay?\u201d Jun Wu Xie frowned.Long Qi continued kneeling on the ground without uttering a single word. He did not deny he had always some prejudice against her. He even deeply suspected that she poisoned Jun Qing! When he saw how she meticulous she was as she treated Jun Qing and the effects of her treatment could be seen, he knew he was in the wrong.Rui Lin Army\u2019s protocols have always been severely strict hence he had habitually seeked his own punishment. It was an ironclad rule that every single member had been drilled into since day one. If one did something wrong, it\u2019s punishment!\u201cSince it\u2019s nothing then you can leave.\u201d She had no interest whatsoever in his position or request. \u00a0This man had repeatedly interrupted her so many times but this was all due to him worrying over Jun Qing, so when he was rude, she really did not care nor take it to heart.He maintained his position for a while longer, stood up and left the room. Only this time, he was very respectful towards her and had even bowed slightly before he closed the door.\u201cWow, what extraordinary thing did you do when I was not around? This looks interesting\u2026\u201d an enigmatic voice with a hint of mischief trailed off from the doorway.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His long black satin hair draped down the side and framed his gorgeous face.That picture itself was a sin.Jun Wu Xie had not seen him for the past few days and had almost forgot about his existence. Didn\u2019t think that he would appear so suddenly.With his appearance, she could vaguely smell the familiar scent of blood, despite it being covered by the strong fragrance of herbs, with her sensitive nose, she could still sniff out that faint trace.Jun Wu Yao looked at her happily but his expression almost crumbled when he saw her frown at him as she covered her nose with her hand. His handsome smile was frozen.\u201cNext time, if you have not completely removed the smell, you are not allowed in the pharmacy.\u201d She warned him with a deep frown. She did not care where he\u2019s from, as long as he didn\u2019t provoke her and Lin Palace, he could do whatever he want.Jun Wu Yao slowly stood up as he looked at her with a distressed expression.The smell was barely discernible moreover this place had such strong pungent herb smell, how keen was this nose of hers to be able to sniff that out from this myriad of smells?\u201cYou dislike that smell this much?\u201d He chuckled.\u201cYes!\u201d She saw him walking towards her slowly. She subconsciously took a step back as he came closer. This smell made her feel really sick if she wasn\u2019t treating any patient!\u201cReally\u2026 sorry\u201d as he looked at the Jun Wu Xie was out outwardly avoiding him, an evil smile flashed by as he suddenly disappeared. Before she could even react, she was embraced by a pair of strong arms.Her delicate little face was forcibly pressed into his broad chest as the smell of blood a.s.saulted her nose as it was many times stronger. Jun Wu Xie stood there petrified.\u201cLet go!\u201d\u201cBe good, next time I will not let you smell it.\u201d Jun Wu Yao not only did not let go, he actually hugged her even tighter.So pet.i.te, so soft, it was like a small little animal hiding in a safe place but the little one he\u2019s holding onto seems to have sharp fangs and was baring it.She was in a frenzy as he hugged her tightly and rubbed her head as if she was some kind of pet! The clothes which she had just changed into had to be changed again as it now had the stench of blood. When he finally let her go, she rushed out of the pharmacy and scrubbed herself many times before she willingly came out.After being abandoned by its master, the little black cat could only glare at Jun Wu Yao. Jun Wu Yao could not help but laugh out as he saw the fleeing shadow of Jun Wu Xie. The black cat could feel some strong energy fluctuations and realised how dangerous this man really was! He immediately followed his master\u2019s\u2019 footsteps and fled the pharmacy.Master! Don\u2019t leave me alone with this crazy man!\u2026\u2026\u2026.Jun Qing finally stirred as he groggily saw a familiar silhouette sitting by his bed. As his vision slowly restored, he realised that it was his worried Father who seemed to have aged since he last saw him.\u201cFather?\u201d Jun Qing struggled to sit up but his body felt as if the bones have all been broken up and it was so intense he could not move.\u201cDon\u2019t move! Lie down!\u201d Jun Xian quickly reached out.\u201cWhat happened to me?\u201d Although his whole body felt as though it was breaking apart and he could not move, he still felt a hint of comfort and ease.\u201cYou really almost scared your Father to death!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Jun Qing helplessly looked at the sullen figure by his bed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Now that he\u2019s much better and can finally eat to replenish his strength and nourish the body, what more are they waiting for?When the servants entered the room with the piping hot porridge, the aroma was so enticing that both Father and Son momentarily looked at the steaming bowls absentmindedly.The porridge had a faint smell of herbs but the smell was not too overpowering. Having not eaten for such a long time, Jun Qing could feel his stomach contracting once the bowl was placed in front of him.Once he took in a deep breath, the aroma a.s.saulted all his senses and his previous loss of appet.i.te was history. He struggled to sit up in his bed to enjoy his first meal for these past few days.After he had eaten his fill, with a bit of difficulty as he sat up in his bed and had only realized that he was in a very precarious situation while he was unconscious.\u201cEvery doctor who saw you concluded that you were on at death\u2019s door..if not for her\u2026.\u201dJun Xian sighed as he thought about the pain of losing his eldest son \u2026 If this kind of thing happened again he really did not know if he could survive.\u201cBut\u2026Jun Wu Xie just started on her medical studies not too long ago, how could she have known that I could be saved?\u201d Jun Qing was full of questions, it seems that this time, \u00a0it was really a huge change in Jun Wu Xie. The wayward rude little girl from before seem to have disappeared without a trace. Even in the face of Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s bullying, she still did not express any discontent, unlike the her before who would have whipped up a storm. She\u2019s so sensible and level headed now.\u201cRecently that child has changed a lot, she\u2019s become very sensible. I think her injury before might not be as simple as we have thought. If not for the major turn of events, she would not have changed so much in such a short time.\u201d Jun Xian did not say it out but he had been thinking about it for a while and made a few guesses.All these started only after she came back riddled with all those injuries. What did she go through?Jun Qing hesitated for a moment before he finally told the truth that Jun Wu Xie had given him the lotus seed right before this incident.\u201cLotus seed?!\u201d Jun Qing frowned slightly. Initially he had thought that someone had secretly tempered but now Jun Wu Xie is suddenly involved.\u201cPerhaps she gave it to me without any deeper meaning or my body simply could not hold up against the poison. No matter what, I believe that Wu Xie will not harm me. But I have to say, although I\u2019m tired now, I\u2019m feeling much better than what I\u2019ve felt over in a decade! The poison has deeply seeped into my bones, all these years, and though it didn\u2019t manage to take my life away but it has been wearing my mind and spirit down.\u201d Jun Qing was worried he would implicate Jun Wu Xie further as he hastily tried to explain.He really wasn\u2019t exaggerating, his body still felt very weak now however his mind was very alert. Also the poison before seem to have rendered him unable to muster up any spirit energy but now he could feel a slight throb as he tried to sense his spirit energy.\u201cReally? Do not think that you can pull a fast one over me. Naturally I believe in our Wu Xie. But if you still feel any discomfort anywhere, do not hide it.\u201d No matter what, both of them are his closest kin and he did not want any harm to befall them.Jun Qing smiled and nodded as he moved his arms in exaggerated motion in an attempt to show his father that he was really fine.However in that moment, there was a surge of a strange feeling. His whole body stiffened as he was deep in thought.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Jun Xian quickly asked as he saw the strange expression Jun Qing had on.Jun Qing gulped as he gave a bewildered look of disbelieve.\u201cMy legs\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat happened to your legs?!\u201d Jun Xian asked anxiously.\u201cThey\u00a0feel\u00a0a little\u2026sore?\u201d Jun Qing\u2019s voice trailed off\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, he could clearly feel something now, something he had missed all these years. Even though it was pain, nevertheless, it was still a feeling!\u201cFather, where is Wu Xie?\u201d He had a sudden flashback.[\u201cUncle, do you trust me?\u201d]When Jun Wu Xie had asked him that question, he didn\u2019t think too much into it but now after all that has happened&h.e.l.lip; After she had asked him that very question, she fed him \u2018that lotus seed\u2019 after which his body underwent major changes.All these were too coincidental!Jun Xian had sent someone to invite Jun Wu Xie over.When she entered the room, there was a faint aroma of herbs as she carried her little black cat in one arm and walked over to the bedside.\u201cUncle woke up.\u201d As if she was expecting it, there was not a trace of surprise in her voice.\u201cWu Xie, this time Uncle really need to thank you properly.\u201d Jun Qing smiled warmly at his niece. He saw the cat that was looking happy and contented in her arms. Jun Wu Xie had always liked animals but because of her impatience, whenever she approached animals, they couldn\u2019t keep still and would run off. He even tried grabbing various cats and dogs \u00a0and let her touch but they always end up running away so it was a very rare sight.\u201cNo need, this is my fault.\u201d She softly said as she stroked the cat\u2019s fur and looked down.This shocked both Father and Son.\u201cWu Xie, what do you mean?\u201d Jun Xian asked gently, fearing his tone was too harsh and scaring off his granddaughter.Jun Wu Xie looked at both of them with bright eyes and slowly said, \u201cIn fact, there\u2019s no reason to hide from both of you. That time, when I fell from the cliff, almost all my bones were broken, if not for Master saving me, I\u2019d have long be dead.\u201d\u201cMaster?\u201dJun Wu Xie nodded, \u201cHe was the one who saved me and sent me back to Lin Palace. However, he did not want other people to know about him, which is why he handed me over to Wu&h.e.l.lip;brother. That entire time while I was recuperating, Master saw that I was interested in learning medicine and he took me in as his disciple. Although I don\u2019t know about his origins, he\u2019s my savior and I know he has amazing skills. The reason why I picked up studying medicine is not because I had an interest in it but because Master said that since my body const.i.tution was weak and I had no contractual spirit, this was a way for me to protect myself.\u201d \u00a0She glanced over to look at them as they looked at her seriously. She continued on, \u201cActually, that was not an ordinary lotus seed, it was given by Master and it has the ability to cleanse the bone marrows.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I also ate the lotus seed, though some discomfort, my body did not have such a reaction like Uncle\u2019s. His poison flaring up scared me but luckily master taught me the way to treat it.\u201dJun Wu Xie spoke calmly, though her voice a little immature, she sounded very credible.This speech was thought up after some deliberation to gloss over the origin of the medicine.She had originally wanted to build up their body const.i.tution discreetly, who knew that lotus seed would have triggered off such a big incident! Now she had to find a plausible excuse as a cover up for her medical skills. Hence, the little black cat and her had been discussing it and they eventually came up with a \u2018Master\u2019. Pus.h.i.+ng everything to her mysterious master would pave her way free from all future problems.After listening to her explanation, Jun Xian and Jun Qing were both in shock. They did not think that Wu Xie would ever acknowledge anyone as her Master.When she had returned back that day, their memories were tampered with and all they knew was that her \u2018brother\u2019 had brought her back, however the specifics were not known.Her explanation may have sounded a bit too incredible, what kind of luck did she have to meet such an expert? However, it did fit all the current questions they had in their minds, like her change in personality as well as her interest in medicine.\u201cWell, Wu Xie, all these time did you meet your Master here in our Palace?\u201d He had on a weird facial expression when he as asked her.Jun Wu Xie nodded.Jun Xian and Jun Qing exchanged glaces. If one looked closely, you could even see their eyebrows twitching.Lin Palace may not look heavily guarded however there is a great number of Rui Lin Army secretly guarding it in the shadows. Not to mention strangers, even any animals, they would be the first to know if any trespa.s.sed into Lin Palace.However this time, they had not heard anything at all. This meant that her Master was an expert who could enter and leave this fortress at his own will while escaping the tight net of surveillance of the Rui Lin Army. He did not leave behind a single clue.Towards this Master of hers they were piqued with curiosity but they knew he meant them no harm or else he wouldn\u2019t have saved her and taught her medicine as well.\u201cFor you to have such a Master is a fortunate thing. Since he doesn\u2019t want to meet anyone, just help us express our grat.i.tude for all his help.\u201d From his vast experience, Jun Xian deduced that this Master of hers did not want to get involved in worldly affairs and hence did not insist any further.To have this Master was good for both Wu Xie and Lin Palace. Jun Xian was elated.\u201cAlright.\u201d She calmly replied as the black cat in her arms shot her a look of misgiving and let out a small meow.Master, you\u2019ve been led astray.

Oh please he does not even exist!Jun Wu Xie remained calm and collected topping it up with a frosty expression.\u201cWhat! You said you ate the lotus seed as well? How are you? Was it very painful?\u201d Jun Xian had witnessed his Son who was a Battle General curl into a shrimp because of the intense pain. What more a mere fourteen year old girl who did not have an ounce of spirit energy? He was very frantic as he asked with a worried expression.Jun Wu Qing shook her head, \u201cI\u2019m fine, there was a bit of discomfort but nothing like Uncle. His body reacted badly to it as he was poisoned before and the poison has seeped deep into his bone crevices over this long period. The lotus seed cleanses the bone marrows giving him a set of bones akin to being reborn. He experienced such pain as it squeezed out all the poison from every nook and cranny. As the poison is embedded deep in his bones, the purging process is very thorough to expel all the impurities and poison out. All these have been expelled out through his pores with his sweat, so there is no need to worry for any future complications.If she wasn\u2019t able to even save Jun Qing, she really didn\u2019t deserve to live anymore.When Jun Xian heard that all of Jun Qing\u2019s impurities and poison has been expelled out with his sweat, his eyes almost popped out.\u201cWhen I woke up, I did feel a difference. My body feels much lighter and when I sat up just now, my legs could feel some sensations.\u201d Jun Qing stated excitedly.It had been the same for all these years, it was as though he didn\u2019t have any legs. Now, even with the slightest feeling, he was delighted.\u201cMaster said that after everything has been cleared, with additional medicine and medicinal bath conditioning, in half a year\u2019s time your legs would be like before.\u201d Borrowing her \u2018Master\u2019 to reveal how skilful she was.The whole room was silent.Both men stared agape at Jun Wu Xie, with eyes wide open.After struggling for over a decade they finally see a glimmer of hope!\u201cWu Xie, what do you mean by\u2026 like before\u2026? Could it be that your Uncle can really walk again? Jun Xian could not stop his excitement , he was just short of jumping in joy in fear of scaring her.She nodded, \u201cHe\u2019ll be able to walk like a normal person, it\u2019s just that he\u2019s been on a wheelchair for over a decade, his muscles are not very developed. Hence if he wants to return to his previous condition, he\u2019ll need up to a year to train and develop his lower body.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u2026I am able to return to that state in a year\u2019s time?\u201d Jun Qing felt as though he was floating along in a dream. He was simply dumbfounded and ecstatic to the point he felt dizzy and his expression was that of shock mixed with happiness.He had thought that this life, he would be wheelchair ridden for good. Any hope that he could ever walk again was a dream. A dream he would trade anything for to be real.And Jun Wu Xie said that he could walk and restore to his previous condition too!Is he really not dreaming?Jun Wu Xie looked at the two men who were verge of tears as their whole face were red with excitement. She looked at them with a hint of puzzled expression. Was there a need to be this excited?She could not understand, his legs were never a problem. Extracting all the poison that had seeped deep in his bones was the problematic issue, however now that it\u2019s been dealt with, why would they get so excited?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her skills were at an unprecedented level, it was as though a University Graduate was doing an elementary school kid\u2019s homework. That was the vast difference.\u201cYes\u201d She replied to their excitement.They remained silent but one could see the flame ignited within their eyes as they tried to digest all the information.Lin Palace was on a decline as there was no successor, however if Jun Qing was able to recover within the next couple of years to his peak, Lin Palace would once again be able to bask in glory.This opportunity was too important to them right now.\u201cWu Xie, there\u2019s a lot of important things at stake here, the matter on your Uncle\u2019s recovery must be kept with strictest confidentiality. About your Master\u2026\u201dJun Xian immediately thought of this critical matter.\u201cMaster said he was not interested in worldly affairs.\u201d What can a non-existent person disclose?\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. We must really thank him for all his help! Please convey to him that if there is anything that Lin Palace can help him with, if it\u2019s within our means, we will do everything we can to fulfill it!\u201d Jun Xian started chattering excitedly.\u201cI will convey it to him.\u201d she faintly responded.\u201cWu Xie, thank you.\u201d Jun Qing looked at Wu Xie with his warm eyes and a gentle smile. He was very thankful that he had such great family support all these years and now his beloved niece said that she could cure him with her Master\u2019s help, he simply could not wait!His \u2018thank you\u2019 made her feel something stirring within. She was slightly surprised. In the past she had saved many people and she had received countless \u2018thank-yous\u2019 from all those she had saved , but those \u2018thank-yous\u2019 \u00a0never carried any weight in her heart.However this time, Jun Qing\u2019s \u2018thank you\u2019 indeed made her feel a nice warmth from within as she felt a glimmer of joy as she let out a rare gentle smile.So it turns out rendering treatment to a family member feels completely different.As she was intoxicated with this feeling, she carried on, \u201dMaster gave me a few lotus seeds and I wanted to give one to Grandfather as well but due to Uncle\u2019s special case, I\u2019ll need to concentrate on Uncle\u2019s treatment for the time being. I will need a bit more time to prepare the conditioning of Grandfather\u2019s body.\u201d She could not be too careless as Jun Xian\u2019s was rather advanced in his age and she had to be extra vigilant. She would want to prepare everything fully before she started and get rid of any variables.Jun Xian never thought he had a share in this fortuitous opportunity. Listening to Jun Wu Xie he had guessed she had already started in her preparations for him.His chest felt warm and fuzzy as he awkwardly turned away as he silently wiped away the tears that were threatening to fall.His Granddaughter is all grown up now. She is finally sensible.In the future who would dare call his Granddaughter a waste?!He\u2019ll not let anyone touch a single hair on her! No one will get away with bullying her!\u201cI\u2019ll leave it all up to you. I will let Uncle Fu know and ask him to brief the kitchen staff. Do what you need to do, no need to ask me for my advise.\u201d \u00a0He chortled heartily and heaved a sigh of relief.In the past, although he had doted on her and loved her unconditionally, he knew that she loved to play pranks on others and she had a haughty temper so he had placed many restrictions on her to prevent any trouble. But now he feel that his heart is finally at ease as he looked at his precious Granddaughter.Sensible, calm, amazing medicinal skills, cares deeply about her family and even backed by a\u00a0powerful Master.

He wanted to flaunt her in front of the other old geezers gloat at their shocked expressions and see if they still dared to call her a waste!Lin Palace\u2019s current predicament could be overturned with Jun Wu Xie\u2019s help. She was the key to it\u2019s revival and to keep her protected as well as Lin Palace, they had to keep everything under wraps until Jun Qing fully recovered.Jun Xian had suffered greatly under someone\u2019s grand scheme and it caused him to lose one of his beloved Sons another was gravely injured and could not even live normally all these years. To keep Lin Palace safe, he had to reduce The Rui Lin Army over the years. If they had found out that Jun Qing could recover and the person doing the treatment was Jun Wu Xie, he was not sure he could keep them both safe with his power alone.Now, keeping Jun Wu Xie safe was top priority.Under Jun Xian\u2019s orders, Jun Wu Xie had complete freedom to do the things she wanted without anyone raising any questions. All the servants no longer procrastinated when she asked them to do something.In order to prevent any repercussions after eating the lotus seed, Jun Wu Xie decided to use herbs to aid in the conditioning of Jun Xian\u2019s body.Jun Wu Xie meticulously prepared various herbal concoctions and diets to complement and condition Jun Xian\u2019s and Jun Qing\u2019s body. She also added in a drop of the white lotus\u2019s tear each time.During this whole process, everyday Uncle Fu personally delivered all the food and medicine from the hands of Jun Wu Xie to Jun Xian, while Long Qi delivered Jun Qing\u2019s portion.Jun Wu Xie treated this very seriously and she could only trust the both of them! No other point of contacts were allowed in case someone slipped in and tempered with anything. This way she could personally supervise their progress without any worries.Both Father and Son were recovering at an astonis.h.i.+ng rate under her care, the only victim was Little Lotus.As his tears were the \u2018special ingredient\u2019 was needed, every few days he had to contribute his part. Every time he appeared, the black cat would always be hot on his tracks as it pounced on him and chased him around as it scuffled with him. The room will be eventually filled with m.u.f.fled sniffles and sobs.He really deserved some sympathy!Battered Little\u00a0Lotus once again contributed his tears as he huddled at the corner of the room with his little body still trembling as it looked at the black cat that was calmly licking its paws by the bedside.Jun Wu Xie had just finished collecting the tears when a light knock on the door sounded. In a practised manner, she swiftly flicked her hand as the Little White Lotus instantly disappeared as it turned into a barely visible ring on her right hand\u2019s ring finger.\u201cCome in.\u201dThe door swung open and Long Qi stood there and bowed slightly while maintaining this posture with his head hung low as he held out two scrolls.\u201cSecond Master has instructed me to hand these over to you, Young Miss.\u201d Long Qi was a man of few words, although he did not talk much, the tone he was speaking in was totally different from the past. Although it still was cold, it had a hint of respect.Jun Qing\u2019s body had been improving at an alarming rate and he knew that all the credit lay in this young maiden in front of him.\u201cPut it over there.\u201d she pointed to the table nearby as she raised her head slowly.Long Qi bowed once again as he entered the room without making any eye contact, he looked towards the ground as he made his way in. After placing it on the table, he was about to leave when she suddenly said, \u201c Wait.\u201dHe immediately froze on the spot.\u201cTake the medicine that\u2019s on the table with you as well.\u201d she a.s.serted.Long Qi raised his head and looked at the table saw a small white porcelain bottle. As he picked it up, he asked, \u201cHow should I apply this for Second Master?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201d as she galnced over at him.His whole body stiffened.\u201cWith your injury, how do you expect to do a good job in protecting my Uncle?

So that saying was referring to people like you.\u201d \u00a0A teasing voice came from the window.Jun Wu Xie furrowed her brows as she looked towards the source of the sound.

Didn\u2019t think that you will be so kind to have prepared medicine for him.\u201d His half amused eyes gradually disappeared as he stared at her.That day after Long Qi had apologised to her and asked her for punishment, she had brushed it off. This stiff and upright man had imposed his own punishment by getting flogged by the pole 150 times until his whole back was in a complete mess, however he did not even let out a scream and he appeared as per normal beside Jun Qing the very next day.Incidentally, Jun Wu Yao had known about this however it did not have anything to do with him moreover he had no interest and had almost completely forgotten about this if not for her actions today.\u201cI hate that smell.\u201d She replied grimly.Jun Wu Yao let out a chuckle as he lightly leaped into her room.\u201cWu Xie is so unfair. When I was injured, how come you didn\u2019t give me any medicine?\u201d With a slight pout he walked over to her side and leaned in with one hand against the wall behind her as he backed her into a corner.His black hair draping down the side of his exquisite face, as it tickled her cheek.Jun Wu Xie frowned as she swept the hair away.\u201cBecause of your name.\u201d She glanced at him and took a step to the side and she walked away calmly.Jun Wu Yao, no medicine, incurable. (TL: this is a literal translation from his name, \u65e0\u836f\u3001\u65e0\u836f\u53ef\u6551\uff09\u201cHahahaha!\u201d After hearing her explanation, he couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing. He grabbed her wrist and pulled her into his arms and gave her an overbearing hug.Her small body was so soft and it carried a faint scent of herbs, it really made one feel at ease.She did not struggle, did not resist, just quietly stayed in his embrace except for that bright pair of eyes glaring at him full of disapproval.\u201cToday I cleaned up properly. Here, smell me, is any of that distasteful smell still lingering?\u201d He whispered closely to her ears as his deep magnetic voice mixed with a tinge of mischief resounded as he teased her.\u201cNo.\u201d Jun Wu Xie felt that something was wrong but she could not pinpoint what with this closeness of his.\u201cRest a.s.sured, as long as it\u2019s anything you not like, I will not let it exist.\u201d As he gave her his commitment with a smile, he wrapped his arms around her tighter.

Many had secretly cursed in their hearts as they sneered, how plain Jun Wu Xie was and how unmatched they were!

He had always been straightforward and always pointed out his shortcomings.

However after Lin Palace started its decline, he gave up all his regard for Lin Palace and had been behaving as he liked without holding anything back.The reason why Mo Xuan Fei and Jun Wu Xie\u2019s broken engagement spread like wildfire was thanks to him as well.All the ministers started crowding around them to watch the good show.\u201cThis matter does not require Wu w.a.n.g to worry, although they are as slippery as eels, I will chase them to the ends of the earth and catch them to ensure the safety of Second Prince.\u201d He replied without any emotion.\u201cThat must really be hard on you, Lin w.a.n.g is no longer young and still have to work so hard, how can we let you handle all that by yourself?

His Majesty also said that he felt bad with regards to what happened with the engagement and has specially extended the invitation to your Wu Xie.\u201cFine.\u201d Jun Xian did not want to waste anymore of his precious time with these geezers as he flicked his sleeves and walked away.Wu w.a.n.g laughed gleefully as he watched Jun Xian\u2019s retreating back and \u2018defeated\u2019 demeanor.\u201cStill putting on such an arrogant front? Does he still think that he is the Lin w.a.n.g of the past?\u201d Wu w.a.n.g scorned as he put on his trademark greasy smile as the other ministers laughed along.\u201cLin w.a.n.g is unable to accept hard reality and his head is still living in the clouds. That Jun Qing is not able to live much longer and with him gone, Lin Palace is only left with that waste. Let\u2019s see how long the Rui Lin Army can last.\u201d Another minister sneered with a smile.\u201cHmph, he still thinks himself as a Great General commanding an entire army but all he has accomplished is losing his two sons.\u201d Wu w.a.n.g and the other ministers continued on their banter.None of them had noticed that once Jun Xian had turned his back on them, there was a glint in his eyes and as he walked away, his \u2018retreating back\u2019 lost its former vicissitudes and he strode on with vigor, no different from when he was commanding the entire army, reverting back to the very same hero which made the State of Qi today.As he entered Jun Wu Xie\u2019s courtyard, he could smell the familiar scent of herbs.Jun Wu Xie was holding two pots of herbal concoctions as she slowly stepped out of her pharmacy when she saw Jun Xian.\u201cGrandfather.\u201d She called out gently as he acknowledged her with a warm smile and nod.\u201cYou are still fiddling around with these? Don\u2019t you feel bored staying at home all the time? Next month the Prince will be having his birthday celebration, I\u2019ll bring you along.\u201d He gave her a loving smile.\u201cAlright.\u201d She didn\u2019t give it much thoughot in her reply.Jun Xian smiled and patted her on the shoulder, without saying another word, he went back to his room.Jun Wu Xie stood rooted to the spot as she watched his disappearing back. Only after his back view was no longer visible, she then continued on her way to Jun Qing\u2019s room.\u201cMeow\u201d the little black cat was playfully rubbing itself against Jun Wu Xie\u2019s calf while walking.Grandfather\u2019s expression was a little off.\u201cMmm.\u201d Jun Wu Xie had noticed that as well.\u201cMeow\u201dIs it related to the Prince\u2019s birthday?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Lin Palace is left with me as the younger generation. So to them, Lin Palace is left with a kid once Jun Qing dies and as Grandfather is already advanced in his age, there is nothing for them to worry about anymore. No matter what they have to put on a show. They weren\u2019t able to dig out any information from my Grandfather\u2019s mouth on Jun Qing\u2019s situation, but if it was a fourteen year old kid like me to prattle on \u2026 Moreover what do you think if a girl who was dumped by a guy and she attends his \u00a0older brother\u2019s birthday celebration and sees him cajoling with another woman affectionately in the presence of others.

This is too outrageous! No wonder he and the second prince are related! On the surface they act all good but in actual fact they want to take this opportunity to embarra.s.s you and make you lose face! How can there be such shameless people in the world?!]\u201cIt\u2019s alright, this is not a big deal, I\u2019ll let them wallow in their happiness for a little while longer. I\u2019ll show them\u2026\u201d She said indifferently as a cold glint flashed across her eyes.Bother her? She does not mind.However those people even dared to put her grandfather and uncle in their calculations? Then they can\u2019t blame her for being ruthless.\u201cFoolish ones who do not deserve to live in this world will perish.\u201d She stared icily at the pot of medicine she was holding.\u201cMeow!\u201d[Master, show them your might! Kill that group of idiots!]Jun Wu Xie no longer spoke as she calmly walked on with her mind full of thoughts.Jun Qing was recovering very well, however to get back to his peak, he needs more time. During this period, she will not be idle, she has her contractual spirit as well and she will train too, one step at a time to be stronger and pull out all those weeds. Clear them all out.To be more powerful, she must start her cultivation. Having a contractual spirit was her key secret.Ever since Jun Xian had given her more authority and lifted most of her restrictions, she could be seen frequently in the Resource Hall where she could be seen flipping through various cultivation techniques.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So no matter how much she read, how much she scoured through each book, she could not find a single cultivation technique suitable for her.If she wasn\u2019t able to find any technique, she wouldn\u2019t be able to cultivate her spirit energy.Where was she to find a plant cultivation technique? This problem became a headache for her.She bore no more hope of finding it within Lin Palace. An idea flashed through her mind.In the memories of this body, there was a secret place hidden deep within this Imperial City.It was an underground market which entrance was tucked in a secluded corner of the city. Many rare items which could not be found in the city could be found here, it also had many unconventional things for sale.The only difference was that the items on sale cannot be bought with money. They could only be exchanged with something equivalent in value.It was pure simple barter trade.The former Wu Xie had once been there when she was on a \u2018date\u2019 with Mo Xuan Fei. She did not even know of it\u2019s existence even though she grew up within the city walls until he had brought her there. She did not like that place as it was dark and gloomy.However, that place was the only place she could think of now and she needed to make a trip there in hope of finding a suitable cultivation technique.Her face was well known in the Imperial City and she needed to go there incognito. She took out various herbs, grinded some into powder, extracted some of the juices and combined them into a paste as she applied it to her face and carefully moulded and changed her face shape.Looking in the mirror was now a young scholarly looking man. She had slightly tweaked and changed her facial features to a more masculine look and changed into a white robe.Before going to the underground market, she needed to prepare the \u2018currency\u2019 there where ordinary silver was deemed worthless. These days she had been in the pharmacy making various elixirs and potions to nourish and aid Jun Xian and Jun Qing\u2019s recovery. She picked a few bottles, stuffed it into her robe and snuck out of the back door in the still of the night.The Imperial City was extremely quiet at night and although it was her first time stepping out of Lin Palace, she followed her body\u2019s memories to the entrance of the underground market.She stopped in front of inconspicuous restaurant. It was a humble looking place, no different from any other buildings lining the streets, sitting at the counter was a waiter who was lazily resting his head on the counter top, when he saw her, he did not say h.e.l.lo and continued lazing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A few men who had just climbed up the stairs looked at Jun Wu Xie, stunned for a moment.\u201cThis kid is actually going to Ghost City alone, how rare.\u201d They whispered amongst themselves as they left.Ghost City was the name of the underground market.Jun Wu Xie stepped into the dark entrance as she slowly descended the steps. When she finally reached the bottom, she was greeted by a lively sight.Even though it was a quiet night in the Imperial City, over here it was just like another world.The streets were bustling alive with various people selling their wares. There were no shops here, only makes.h.i.+ft wooden stands littered the street. These wooden stands were around half the height of a person and items are placed there for sale.Two men were stationed at the entrance of Ghost City. They each wore a mask and only a pair of sharp and quiet eyes could be seen through the slit of the mask.Jun Wu Xie walked over to them and they did not even blink.\u201cMeow?\u201d The little black cat followed her closely as it looked at the sight before them.[Master, how are we going to find a suitable cultivation technique for you?]\u201cIf it is suitable for me, when we are near it Little Lotus would be able to sense it.\u201d Jun Wu Xie whispered. Each cultivation technique had a small spiritual imprint and if it was suitable for the contractual spirit to cultivate it, there would be a spiritual resonance between them. This would help her in identifying it amongst this myriad of items placed in this vast marketplace.\u201cMeow.\u201d[Are you sure that little crying idiot will be able to sense anything?]The little black cat held the Little Lotus in contempt, whenever they met, it only knew how to cry.\u201cWe\u2019ll have a look around first.\u201d Jun Wu Xie still held onto a small strand of hope.Despite going through the huge book collection in Lin Palace, Little Lotus did not have a single reaction to any of the cultivation techniques. This was her last resort.Ghost City was big but Jun Wu Xie was purely focused on books and had no interest in any other things as she sieved through the crowds as she carefully inspected the items on display at each stall she pa.s.sed.The only thing was\u2026When a group of people crowd together, the surrounding is mixed with a variety of odors, sweat, perfume and as the number of people in this marketplace was not small, this led to an increase in temperature which made it hot, humid, stuffy and smelly.To others, they were simply too excited about the items on sale here and paid no heed to such minor discomfort.To Wu Xie, however, this combination was driving her crazy. She wrinkled her brows as she tried her best not to get into contact with anyone as she weaved her pet.i.te body through the crowd.This place \u2013 she will definitely not come again!The little black cat who was nimbly following by her side could clearly feel her frazzled nerves.For its Master who had an acute sense of smell, this place was simply h.e.l.l.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Under these harsh conditions, she had a hard time concentrating and looking for cultivation books as the items sold there were not specialized shops but individual sellers who sold anything and everything!After great difficulty, she finally reached a less busy place as she calmed down a bit. The stalls here were remotely scattered about, as she was about to move on, she felt a trace of warmth emitted out from the ring. She stopped in her tracks. She could feel her ring warming up.Is it here? The cultivation technique? This was the first time Little Lotus had responded to anything as she scanned her surroundings intently.Where she was currently frozen in place, there was a total of ten stalls nearby. Her eyes darted around as her gaze finally landed on a stall which had a few old books on sale.Displayed on the stand were a bunch of dilapidated books, some of which even the cover was barely intact, some t.i.tles could not even be read.Manning the stall was a pale faced unkempt teenager who was shabbily dressed. He was sitting on a wooden stool, chewing on a blade of bamboo leaf and \u00a0smiling happily as he was deeply engrossed in a book he was holding.Even when Jun Wu Xie stood in front of his booth he did not respond.Both parties did not bother with each other as they both each did their own thing.Jun Wu Xie was now focused on the row of books displayed in front of her as she felt the intensity of Little Lotus\u2019s reaction much stronger as she came closer to the books. She was sure that the book she needed must be within these books.All the dilapidated books may have lost the former glory of their cover but their contents were still intact.However\u2026After flipping through the contents a few times, a frown appeared between her brows \u2013 These books were not books on cultivation.These books were clearly meant for a gardener!The contents taught people how to grow plants and flowers and had absolutely no relation to cultivation.On her scholarly masculine face, her lips were twitching as she tried to compose her inner self. Little Lotus intense reaction was definitely related to these gardening books. She knew that if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that they were outside, Little Lotus would have turned into his human form and s.n.a.t.c.hed them all up!Little Lotus was on the edge as he couldn\u2019t transform and take the books himself, he kept on urging her.\u201cDear lovely Master, please bring these all home! Dear Almighty Master, please bring these books home! Dear lovely Master, please bring\u2026\u201dJun Wu Xie clenched her fists.She had accepted that her contractual spirit was a rare plant type lotus and had resigned herself to her fate, however now that she wants to embark on her cultivation, this little guy wants her to pick up some gardening books?Jun Wu Xie wanted to leave but Little Lotus kept pleading and urging her to bring the books back.\u201cMeow?\u201d The little black cat looked at Jun Wu Xie with a puzzled expression.\u201cHmm?\u201d The unkempt youth finally pulled himself away from his book and noticed that there was someone browsing as he raised his head and lazily looked at the scholarly youth in front of his stall ,as if appraising an item, he looked at Jun Wu Xie from head to toe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although his pale face had dirt smeared all over, he gave his best business smile.\u201cPlease have a look, if you see anything that interests you, just let me know!\u201d He said enthusiastically.Jun Wu Xie forced out a smile as her lips tightened into a straight line. She still felt conflicted on these books as she fiddled her fingers against the warm ring.\u201cWhat do you want in return for these books?\u201d Jun Wu Xie asked coldly. She came to this marketplace full of hope and expectations; never had she thought that she would end up trading for some dilapidated gardening books instead.\u201cAll of these? You want all of these books?\u201d The unkempt youth flashed a bright smile as an excited glint flashed across his eyes, as if looking at a fat sheep.\u201cYes.\u201d She nodded curtly, all she wanted was to quickly get this over with and continue looking for her cultivation technique book!The unkempt youth grinned as he stuck out one dirty hand emphasizing all five fingers.\u201cFive Eastern Pearls!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Jun Wu Xie stared at him blankly, looked at the books and swiftly turned around to walk away.One Eastern Pearl\u2019s value was equivalent to a ton of gold! That would be millions of gold coins worth! This youth\u2019s opening price was ridiculously exorbitant!\u201cHey! Hey! Don\u2019t go! Don\u2019t leave!\u201d The youth immediately got fl.u.s.tered as he saw her turn away.Jun Wu Xie did not even bother with him and continued to walk away as the ring started to glow and suddenly there was a bright burst of light.\u201cDo not go! Do not go! Do not go!\u201d From her side came an anxious yet tender voice. Jun Wu Xie was startled as she glanced at her right sleeve.THIS LITTLE LOTUS DARED TO DEFY HER?For the sake of these dilapidated books he actually defied her and transformed so openly?Not to mention how eye-catching his appearance was, when he appeared the bright burst of light in such a dark environment was enough to cause an uproar. A strong lotus scent was floating in the air along with his sudden appearance. This had attracted a lot of attention of many people close by and they all had stopped in their tracks and started looking around.If only she knew how, she would have sent him straight back to that Spirit World he mentioned before!\u201cShut up and stay still.\u201d Jun Wu Xie growled. No one knew that she had a contractual spirit and if it was exposed here, things will get messy.During their banter, the unkempt youth had managed to catch up to her and within his hands were those few books she had indicated her interest in.\u201cPlease do not go! If you think it\u2019s too much, I can give you a discount. How about four pearls?\u201d He ran in front of her to obstruct her path as he tried to hard sell the books in hand.Jun Wu Xie knew that Little Lotus would not let her go back without kicking up a fuss if she did not purchase these books. She sighed in resignation as she looked over to the youth and said, \u201cI do not have any Eastern Pearls, only elixirs.\u201d\u201cHuh? Elixirs?\u201d The unkempt youth did not bother masking his disappointment as he scratched his head and his smile slowly faded as he muttered, \u201cWhat can I do with elixirs from such a place\u2026..\u201d\u201cWell, let\u2019s forget about it if you do not have any Eastern Pearls.\u201d He turned and walked back listlessly.Just as he did that, Little Lotus started acting up by struggling and kicking about in her sleeves.Jun Wu Xie\u2019s face turned completely black.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The contrast in his reaction was evident.\u201cI just need you to tell me where can I find a stall in this vicinity that accepts elixirs and I can trade it for something you want?\u201d She asked him in a straightforward manner.He looked at her as he deliberated for a while as he touched his nose and replied, \u201cThere is actually a man trading Eastern Pearls for elixirs, it\u2019s just that\u2026the type of elixirs he wants is a bit\u2026Truthfully, I don\u2019t think a kid like you has the type of elixirs he wants.\u201dThis kid in front of him looked kind of fragile and he didn\u2019t want to dash his hopes and have him humiliated in front of so many others. Although such a young kid in Ghost City was rarely seen, at such a young age what kind of elixirs could he possibly have to trade for Eastern Pearls?\u201cBring me there\u201d Jun Wu Xie curtly said.The youth looked at her wide-eyed as he looked back at his empty stall.\u201cIf the trade is successful, other than your four Eastern Pearls, I can give you a bottle of elixir.\u201d Jun Wu Xie had seen his reluctance and wanted to get this over and done with as soon as possible.\u201cI really do not want your elixir\u2026If I had wanted elixir I do not need to come all the way here\u2026\u201d He grumbled and muttered to himself. He looked over at this kid in front of him and could not place this nagging feeling within.Somehow he had felt that there was something different about this kid standing in front of him. The calmness he exuded was very different from all the other people he had came across in Ghost City. Usually young masters from prominent households would be swaggering around with a bunch of people fawning over them. This kid however, despite his young age, seem to emit a confidence that was rarely seen.\u201cOh well, I might as well accompany you to that old man\u2019s place. Since it\u2019s been so many days I\u2019ve been here and you are the only person to have made an offer.\u201d He said decisively as all the apprehension he had disappeared.Compared to the unkempt youth\u2019s stall, this stall selling Eastern Pearls was packed with people as the crowd was gawking at the various treasures lined up.Nine large luminous pearls were placed around a velvet box. With these luminous pearls surrounding it, the Eastern Pearls seems to be glowing with breathtaking iridescent sheen. Other than Eastern Pearls, this stall also sold many other Spiritual Gems of various grades.After the contractual spirit has established the bond with their master and formed the ring, such gems and pearls were excellent cultivation resources that could nourish the spiritual energy and amplify the bond.Such Spiritual Gems were worth much more as compared to normal precious gems. Each Spiritual Gem could make one\u2019s cultivation improve by leaps and bounds! However the price was exorbitant, hence these resources are usually limited for the rich and powerful.Lin Palace had the luxury to secure a few of these in their vault as the Founding Emperor had bestowed them a generous amount to reward them for their military merits.Jun Xian had especially set aside a few top grade Spiritual Gems for Jun Wu Xie to use once she had become of age but there was no chance to use them.For now, Jun Wu Xie had little interest in these Spiritual Gems. It was too early to use them as she had not even found a suitable cultivation technique. It was like a baby trying to run before it even learned how to crawl.The stall owner was a man in his fifties, smoking a pipe as he openly gauged all the patrons surrounding his stall. Even with such a demeanor, the crowd at his stall did not seem to mind, in fact, more people began crowding around.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This attractive couple was was eye catching as people kept sneaking glances to admire them.\u201cThis place has some good stuff.\u201d The young man said gently as his almond eyes were glued to his lady companion.The lady simply nodded with an air of arrogance.The little black cat which was by Jun Wu Xie\u2019s side went ballistic. It\u2019s fur stood on ends as it hissed.[That adulterous couple!]The couple was precisely Mo Xuan Fei and Bai Yun Xian.Jun Wu Xie casually glanced over without much response.\u201cThese two Spiritual Gems as well as these nine Eastern Pearls are quite something!\u201d Mo Xuan Fei chirped. Ever since that incident, Bai Yun Xian \u00a0had been very gloomy and never smiled. He had tried all means and ways to make her smile but nothing had worked when he suddenly thought of Ghost City. With all its novelties and rare items, he was sure he could find something to cheer her up with!After strolling about Ghost City for quite sometime, Bai Yun Xian was not moved. She was Qing Yun Clan Sovereign\u2019s disciple! What rare things had she not seen?They had combed almost the whole market place when she finally found something that caught her interest.Each spiritual gem was barely the size of of her pinky finger nail however it was considered big and it was filled to the brim with spiritual energy as both of their contractual spirits had reacted to it.The nine Eastern Pearls made even a prince of a state sigh as Mo Xuan Fei looked at them with admiration. Such exquisite quality Eastern Pearls in the Imperial Treasure Vault were very rare.\u201cThese nine Eastern Pearls are a perfect fit for the crown that I\u2019ve specially prepared for you. Do you like them?\u201d He nudged her tenderly as he looked into her eyes, seeing if she understood the hidden meaning behind his words.Bai Yun Xian nodded coyly as she finally let out a smile.While this couple continued their flirty exchange, the crowd was busy whispering amongst themselves and spun some tales of their own. Everyone around them had long known who this infamous couple was.Previously when Mo Xuan Fei and Jun Wu Xie were officially engaged, Mo Xuan Fei had been the subject of sympathy. Everyone had pitied him and empathized with him. However now that he was together with Bai Yun Xian, he became the object of jealousy and hate as people around stared at him enviously.Jun Wu Xie was notoriously known throughout as a tyrant. Although she was as beautiful as a flower, her personality and actions had overshadowed her looks. Not many could stand that fiery temper of hers!Bai Yun Xian was completely different, not only was she beautiful, she exuded an aura of a celestial being with her gentle demeanour and soft spoken manner. To top it off, she was Qing Yun Clan Sovereign\u2019s disciple! No matter what, she was the G.o.ddess of many men and when news was out that Mo Xuan Fei and her were together, it aroused the animosity all around.People respected Bai Yun Xian all the more when they saw her in real life and berated Jun Wu Xue as they chattered among themselves.Word for word, all these had been heard by Jun Wu Xie but she remained calm and collected. Not a single reaction or expression could be seen.Instead, the little black cat standing by her lost all its patience and saw red. All it wanted to do now was to charge at all these imbeciles standing before it and wipe them all out! It hissed menacingly.[What do these imbeciles know?!

He gave the surrounding crowd who were admiring Bai Yun Xian a look of contempt.He had said it very softly but Jun Wu Xie had caught what he said.When the youth met Jun Wu Xie\u2019s gaze, he gave her a grin and he laughed out. \u201cDidn\u2019t I say I wasn\u2019t interested in elixirs? Naturally I won\u2019t be interested in Qing Yun Clan as well.\u201dThe youth tried to explain however Jun Wu Xie paid no heed to him as she strode past him.He helplessly laughed to himself and said no more.\u201cWhat do you want to trade for in exchange for these two Spiritual Gems and the nine Eastern Pearls?\u201d Once Mo Xuan Fei saw the smile on his beloved, he had decided to splurge on her.That time when Mo Xuan Fei brought Jun Wu Xie to Ghost City, not to even a single gold coin was spent. They had only walked a couple of streets and they headed back.Now with Bai Yun Xian by his side, he was much more generous.The old man looked up at Mo Xuan Fei, exhaled some smoke from the pipe and casually said: \u201cI only accept elixirs.\u201dMo Xuan Fei was slightly startled.As a Second Prince to a nation, he had seen all sorts of treasures and had access to a large portion of them as well. However, in terms of medical advancements and elixirs, State of Qi was not as developed as its counterparts and this was one area he was lacking in. All the valuable potions and elixirs were locked up in a separate vault which he had no access to.\u201cI\u2019ll trade it with you for jade.\u201d Mo Xuan Fei countered. He did not want to lose face in front of Bai Yun Xian, as he casually took out a piece of fine jade almost as big as his palm. This jade was indeed a rare treasure. Mo Xuan Fei was determined to impress Bai Yun Xian.Unfortunately, the old man did not bother to even give it a glance and continued smoking his pipe.It was clear that he wasn\u2019t interested. If this had happened in Imperial City, who would dare to offend Mo Xuan Fei and not give him any face? He was a dignified prince and he actually wanted to buy something from you and that meant that he had placed you in his sight and that itself should be the greatest honour. If you did not comply, the guards will dismantle the stall and the person thrown in the dungeon.But this was Ghost City.Although it was opened beneath the Imperial City, it wasn\u2019t owned by the State of Qi. It was opened and managed by a mysterious origin that had brawny guards wearing masks and maintaining the order within the marketplace. It was truly a unique place which was hidden away from the main stream but these guards were not to be trifled with. No matter what you sell, no one bothers. However, if someone wants to stir trouble by not matching the trade, the guards will immediately throw that person out.There were also those who tried to play dirty tricks were \u2018invited\u2019 out and banned from returning to Ghost City. There was a zero tolerance policy on troublemakers.There was once when the Prime Minister\u2019s son had been thrown out into the streets and had disgraced the entire family. However, the Prime Minister did not dare create any trouble in Ghost City and suffered silently by pretending that no such incident ever happened.Since then, the people knew that the ident.i.ty behind Ghost City must be from a powerful background and no one dared to mess around again.As for Mo Xuan Fei, he did not know who exactly was behind Ghost City but he knew that it was someone he could not afford to offend. If he did, he may end up with the same outcome as the Prime Minister\u2019s son!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Bai Yun Xian slightly wrinkled her brows as she stepped forward and handed that old man a small porcelain bottle.\u201cThese should be enough?\u201d She tilted her chin upwards and asked smugly.The old man took the bottle as he lifted his brows and glanced over at her.All the onlookers craned their necks to see what Qing Yun Clan Sovereign\u2019s disciple handed over. It certainly must be good stuff!The old man opened the bottle and took a whiff.Once he opened the bottle, a sweet refres.h.i.+ng scent permeated the surroundings and left the crowd fascinated.\u201cThis is\u2026?\u201d He asked in a raspy voice.Bai Yun Xian sneered and replied, \u201cThis is Qing Yun Clan\u2019s infamous Qing Yun Pill.\u201dOnce these words came out from her mouth, gasps could be heard everywhere.Qing Yun Pill!This was the rumoured elixir which was personally concocted by Qing Yun Clan\u2019s Sovereign. It was infamous to be known as THE life saving pill \u2013 even a person who had half a foot in the grave could extend their lifespan by having a pill a day.This recipe was a closely guarded secret and the Sovereign was the one and only person who knew how to concoct this pill. For this, many kings and rulers had tried all means and ways to get their hands on it. This time, Bai Yun Xian had made this trip to State of Qi to specially deliver this prized elixir to the Emperor.The one she had just handed over was specially given to her by her Master for her own use.The name of this pill resounded throughout various nations and was an illusive name that many wanted but could not get their hands on.\u201cWow, she really lives up to the name of being Qing Yun Clan Sovereign\u2019s disciple. She could even pull out THE Qing Yun Pill out so easily! This old man is really lucky and have scored big time.\u201d Many people were secretly envious as they stared agape at that little porcelain bottle as they discussed in hushed tones.Changing these items for a Qing Yun Pill was a huge loss for Bai Yun Xian.\u201cWhat do you know? These pills were personally concocted by Qing Yun Clan Sovereign! Even if she finished it, all she need to do is to simply ask for more from her Master. Don\u2019t mix her up with the ordinary folks like yourself! These pills to her may not be worth that much.\u201d One of the onlookers said as he looked enviously at the golden couple in front of him.To be able to hook up with Bai Yun Xian, the Second Prince influence had gone up by a few notches.Bai Yun Xian was definitely in a different league from Jun Wu Xie.Although these were spoken in hushed tones, it could still be heard and Bai Yun Xian nodded in approval inwardly as she smiled towards Mo Xuan Fei.However, after sniffing the elixir, the old man simply stuffed the cover back and chucked the bottle back to her.Bai Yun Xian\u2019s smiling face stiffened.\u201cThis is something I do not need. Not changing\u2026 Not changing.\u201d He said wistfully as he sat back in a laid back position and slowly inhaled a deep breath and blew out the smoke from his pipe.For that moment, everyone\u2019s eyes almost popped out.Had this old man gone senile already?!That was THE Qing Yun Pill!Bai Yun Xian\u2019s smile immediately crumbled and her displeasure was shown on her face. This was the first time someone had rejected her Master\u2019s personally concocted elixir!\u201cDear Sir; this is The Qing Yun Pill. Q-I-N-G Y-U-N pill ah!! Are you sure you don\u2019t want it?\u201d She broke it down for him in exasperation.\u201cNo, no, no! If you don\u2019t have any other types of elixirs then don\u2019t disturb my other patrons.\u201d He snorted impatiently.This was a huge blow to the couple as they stood there awkwardly \u2013 their expressions black to the extreme.They even began to suspect this old man was not out to do business, he even had the audacity to slight and reject the Qing Yun Pill?\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to trade then we won\u2019t trade! You really think your items are worth that much?!\u201d Mo Xuan Fei coldly reb.u.t.ted.The old man glanced at him, sneered and no longer bothered with him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He strutted to the stall and handed it over to the old man.\u201cHey kid, do you think this is a party? Just squeezing in and following other peoples footsteps by simply handing in any elixir you have with you? For goodness sake, the old man just rejected the Qing Yun Pill ah! THE Qing Yun Pill! Do you even know what that entails? Careful he doesn\u2019t throw it right back in your face!\u201d A rowdy bystander heartily added oil to the fire.Jun Wu Xie simply ignored the others as she looked at the old man.The old man looked at the fair boy standing in front and got up as he reached for the bottle. \u201cLittle boy, what do you want to change it for?\u201d\u201cEastern Pearls.\u201d Jun Wu Xie replied.\u201cOh.\u201d The old man casually opened the bottle. Once he opened the bottle, a sweet refres.h.i.+ng scent of herbs mixed with a hint of lotus permeated the surrounding. Those that were near enough had the luxury to inhale this immediately felt physically and mentally more comfortable.Those gathered close to the stall could not help but let out an involuntary sigh as they felt their mind at ease and their spirits uplifted.The old man\u2019s once clouded eyes seemed to have regained their brightness, all the apprehensiveness dissipated away as he raised his head and looked at Jun Wu Xie with a bewildered expression.\u201cLittle boy, what is this elixir? What is the name of it?\u201d\u00a0 The old man asked in an urgent tone.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a name. It\u2019s just a regular blood conditioning elixir.\u201d Jun Wu Xie had not bothered to come up with names for these as they were created simply for Jun Xian and Jun Qing\u2019s body conditioning, part of their recuperation regime. She did not need to waste time on something so trivial.\u201cHow much do you want to trade it for? How about this? You give me this bottle and you can take these nine Eastern Pearls and choose any other three Spiritual Gems?\u201d The old man\u2019s nostrils flared up as he asked in an overly excited tone and looked at Jun Wu Xie with sparkly eyes. He folded his hands across as he careful tucked the bottle within his embrace, making it clear he had no intention of handing back the medicine.As soon as the old man made the offer, the crowd was rendered speechless. In a moment, there was an outburst of discussions as they stared at the incredulous scene in front of them.This eccentric old man blatantly rejected the Qing Yun Pill and yet he coveted a nameless elixir from an unknown source?What did this imply? That kid\u2019s elixir was even better than Qing Yun Clan Sovereign\u2019s infamous Qing Yun Pill?\u201cNo, I just want the Eastern Pearls.\u201d Jun Wu Xie was not interested in anything else.\u201cHow about you have another look at the other items?\u201d The old man coaxed as he looked at her anxiously, tightening his grip on the bottle.\u201cNo need.\u201d Jun Wu Xie frowned in annoyance. This old man was really long-winded!\u201cThen tell me what do you need? If I have it, I\u2019ll change it with you?\u201d He bent down and started digging for something and he retrieved a pouch and opened it.As he revealed the contents, everyone\u2019s eyes were sparkling and intermittent gulping sounds could be heard all around. In it were various precious Spiritual Gems full of brilliance and Spiritual energy. The quality of these made those previously displayed pale in comparison.For a moment, everyone stared at the pile of precious Spiritual Gems in a daze.\u201cI just want the Eastern Pearls.\u201d Jun Wu Xie\u2019s voice had a hint of impatience in it.The old man was about to say something when a figure took a step and stood between them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I am willing to use anything to trade it with you. All I want is to let my beloved woman be happy by getting a suitable present for her, please help me fulfill this wish.\u201d Mo Xuan Fei arrogantly stepped between the two as he voiced his intentions.He did not know what backing this kid had, but this trip today was to cheer Bai Yun Xian up, if not this would all have been for naught. He didn\u2019t have any more ideas to cheer her up.That old man did not know his stuff and did not want the Qing Yun Pill. He, however, treated a nameless elixir with an unknown origin as a precious treasure. He wanted to show that with his ident.i.ty and resources he could get his hands on whatever he wanted! That fool of an old man should awaken from his stupor.Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes as she looked at Mo Xuan Fei.Hmph. All these years, these people from the Imperial Palace kept looking for trouble with her Lin Palace. They\u2019ve been bullying her dear grandfather and uncle for so long. They are really asking for retribution.These pills she made herself? She\u2019d rather feed the dogs than to give it to him.\u201cNot trading.\u201d She said coldly.You want elixir? Maybe in your next life. Now? I can consider feeding you poison. With compliments \u2013 at no extra charge at all!When the old man first rejected him, he felt as if his face was being slapped. Once again, within a short span, this little kid in front \u2018slapped\u2019 his face yet again! Mo Xuan Fei had never felt so humiliated in his entire life! He was raging inside, his face was utterly black and ugly to the extreme. \u00a0(TL: It\u2019s more like a metaphor when \u2018he lost his face\u2019 it\u2019s as though someone slapping his face)Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s timely interruption made Jun Wu Xie change her mind.She immediately took a step to the side and asked the old man: \u201cI can give you another two bottles as well! Just give me all the Spiritual Gems with the similar attributes as the first two you offered me.\u201d Jun Wu Xie casually pointed to the new pile of gems the old man had taken out from the pouch.All eyes were shocked wide open, how many bottles of elixir did he have? Looking at this reckless kid casually pointing to the Spiritual Gems as though he was choosing fish in the market. He chose all the similar attributes to the first pair the golden couple had their eyes on.This sudden turn of event shocked everyone silly. At first he had rejected the old man\u2019s offer, however even though Mo Xuan Fei had put up a ridiculously generous offer for the unknown elixir, the kid actually rejected Mo Xuan Fei as well. The craziest thing was that after Mo Xuan Fei made his offer, the kid changed his mind instantly.Everyone\u2019s attention was now on the golden couple, they were all focused on the couples\u2019 reaction.Mo Xuan Fei nodded in approval as he felt much better.This kid was really clever! He had understood the hidden meaning behind Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s proposal. By refusing him, the kid could change all the Spiritual Gems and present it to Bai Yun Xian and himself for other treasures. The kid had settled the whole matter beautifully.The old man did not care for the reason, as long as he got his hands on the wondrous elixir, and it was not only one! The kid had two more! What a fruitful encounter!\u201cOk, I\u2019ll get it for you.\u201d Without a trace of hesitation, the old man begin picking out the various gems as he was smiling and humming a tune.Jun Wu Xie took out another two bottles and pa.s.sed it to the old man.Jun Wu Xie tucked the nine Eastern Pearls away safely and took some Spiritual Gems in her hand. She looked at the sparkly beads in her hand and looked over at Mo Xuan Fei and Bai Yun Xian.The couple had on a relieved expression while their eyes betrayed them as their eyes were burning with desire for those Spiritual Gems in her hands.Everyone was waiting anxiously in antic.i.p.ation. Waiting for that kid to pa.s.s these treasures to the Second Prince as the kid picked up two gems with two fingers.Crunch.Everyone focused on the two Spiritual Gems held between the fingers and mouth dropped open when they saw the boy crus.h.i.+ng the Spiritual Gems, as the broken gems turned into specks of sparkling stars falling to the ground.Jun Wu Xie blankly looked at the couple in front and little by little, her hands began crus.h.i.+ng all the priceless Spiritual Gems in her palm, turning them into stardust. She then casually dusted all the sparkly dust off her two hands after doing the deed.Spiritual Gems may be more priceless than precious gems however their toughness was their main flaw. They were very brittle, being the main reason why they were so rare as well. If one was not careful, it would easily turn into dust.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The veins around his neck were popping out.If this wasn\u2019t Ghost City, he\u2019d have killed this arrogant young punk a million times!Bai Yun Xian bit her lower lips she stared viciously at Jun Wu Xie.Feeling satisfied from watching Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s expression, Jun Wu Xie turned around and handed the box containing the nine Eastern Pearls over to an unkempt youth behind.\u201cMy book.\u201d She demanded.The youth froze for a moment as he absentmindedly handed over the few dilapidated books to her.As the crowd saw the exchange being carried out, their mind frazzled.This kid\u2026is not that stupid\u2026 right?Crus.h.i.+ng priceless gems into dust easily and now traded a box of precious Eastern Pearls for\u2026for a few dilapidated books?!!Everyone went crazy.This kid really had character! He was too rich! Too domineering!When Mo Xuan Fei saw that Jun Wu Xie had changed those l.u.s.trous Eastern Pearls for some old and worn out books, he almost vomited blood. Some of these books had some of their covers partially torn, these books were in such bad condition that even if they were left by the roadside, no one would have bothered taking a look at them. These books were actually traded for NINE Eastern Pearls?Today, he was really humiliated to the bone.Once Jun Wu Xie had gotten hold of the books, she could feel Little Lotus\u2019s happiness. Now that all has been settled, she turned to leave.\u201cLittle Guy! When you have time please come again! Come by whenever you are free, no matter if it\u2019s Eastern Pearl or whatever Spiritual Gems you are looking for, I have plenty!\u201d The old man clamoured after her.After she left, Jun Wu Xie felt someone following her from behind. She whirled around and saw the unkempt youth. He blinked a few times and gave her a rogue smile.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d She asked coldly.\u201cWell, I was wondering if you still have any more of that elixir you\u2019ve just traded? He scratched his head in an embarra.s.sed manner.\u201cYou said you had no interest?\u201d Jun Wu Xie frowned. It was because he had rejected her elixirs that she had to go through all that just now.\u201cUh, I did not know you had such quality elixir, in such places usually nothing of that calibre appears. \u201c He answered truthfully with a sheepish tone. He did not even put Qing Yun Clan in his eyes, what more could a young kid offer?However when that old man opened the bottle, he knew he had made a huge mistake!\u201cWell, didn\u2019t you say that you would give me one?\u201d He asked as his dirty smeared face hid some of the redness.\u201cThat box has NINE Eastern Pearls.\u201d She cautioned.Previously she had promised him an elixir but now that she had paid in double, she no longer needed to pa.s.s him a bottle of the elixir.What\u2019s more, he didn\u2019t want it in the first place!\u201cI can pay you five!\u201d He quickly offered.\u201cI don\u2019t need.\u201d She answered immediately as she turned around.

All she had were those few gardening books and she even made a loss of three bottles of elixir.It was late in the night and not a single soul could be seen.On an empty street of the Imperial City, Jun Wu Xie and the little black cat were on their way back, the lonely silence of the night with the moonlight s.h.i.+ning on them, elongating their shadows \u2013 only her footsteps could be heard. She walked back in resignation with her mind full of thoughts.As they continued walking, the cold wind was howling loudly through the dark streets.

A deep enigmatic voice hushed her.\u201cShhh.\u201d The black shadow directed it this time to the black furball.The little black cat stiffened.\u201cGoing out so deep into the night all alone is not a very good choice.\u201d The deep voice said in a teasing voice as he breathed down her slender neck. She trembled slightly.\u201cJun Wu Yao, let go of me!\u201d Without turning back, Jun Wu Xie knew who it was right away.This playful voice was ingrained deep within her.\u201cHold still, its so cold at night. Look, your body is so cold,here, let me warm you up.\u201d Under the veil of darkness, Jun Wu Yao smiled contentedly as he held her close and hugged her even tighter. He loved this feeling, so small and pet.i.te and her body was so soft.\u201cI\u2019m not cold.\u201d She retorted.\u201cOh? I\u2019m cold, you help me warm up then.\u201d The chuckled as he leaned in further bending slightly, chin resting on her shoulder.\u201cYour are really not aware of your surroundings. You need to be more alert, you\u2019ve been followed by other people for a whole night and yet did not notice.\u201d His dark purple eyes narrowed.

With Jun Wu Xie sneaking out at night, just having some of the elite shadow guards following her would have sufficed, there wasn\u2019t a need to have Long Qi personally guarding her.Her medicines seem pretty incredible, they have really won quite a number of people over!Jun Wu Yao frowned slightly, not waiting for her to say anything, he turned her back, with one hand on her waist, the other hand clasping her jaw and lifted her face.Under the moonlight, a face that could move countries was replaced by a plain ordinary face.As Jun Wu Yao\u2019s rough fingertips gently rubbed against her delicate lips, he gave a teasing and playful grin.\u201cReally ugly.\u201d The foreign face with the different facial features staring back at him really made him want to wipe them away completely.\u201cDo not look then.\u201d Jun Wu Xie frowned, she really could not understand what was on his mind.He rarely stayed in Lin Palace, his presence was very elusive. He would sometimes surprise her by suddenly appearing, at times not a single trace could \u00a0be found. As he had said before, he had no animosity with Lin Palace meant no harm to them.

He heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Jun Wu Yao carrying Jun Wu Xie in his arms as they came out from a dark alley.\u201cYoung Master, Miss.\u201d He called out but he was secretly astonished that he could not sense the presence of his Young Master previously.Without even giving a glance at Long Qi, Jun Wu Yao simply continued to carry Jun Wu Xie as they headed back to Lin Palace.Long Qi silently followed behind them.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.The whole incident of Jun Wu Xie was simply \u2018forgotten\u2019. When the sun rose the next day, Jun Xian and Jun Qing did not bring the matter up as Long Qi still followed Jun Qing and tended to him as they carried on their daily routines.As soon as Jun Wu Xie and the little black cat entered the pharmacy, little lotus was called out in a firm voice by the little black cat.[You rascal, come out!]A trembling little figure could be seen as it quickly sprawled into the ground on all fours with its head bowed down.Jun Wu Xie had her arms folded across her chest, looking at that little figure with a cold glare.Little lotus shook involuntarily.The room was quiet.After half an hour standoff, little lotus could no longer bear the suffocating pressure. He started to cry out, with his watery eyes looking pitifully looking at Jun Wu Xie.\u201cDo not leave me\u2026\u2026. P..Please do not \u2026*sniff*..se..send me back.\u201d Little beads of precious tears came rolling off his cheeks. He quivered as he looked over at Jun Wu Xie. He knew that he had incurred the wrath from his master when it appeared on his own accord in Ghost City.Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes as she gave him a piercing stare.Little lotus small legs began to s.h.i.+ver again.[When I said that you were useless, I didn\u2019t think that you were that useless, even forcing Master to get these dilapidated gardening books. Tell me, what are we going to do with these musy old things?]Little black cat jumped onto the table as one of its paws touched the pile of old books that were placed there as it looked menacingly at little lotus.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I must say your luck is really good\u2026\u201d \u00a0Little lotus tried his best to explain it to Jun Wu Xie, except that his shy and reserved demeanor did not seem to be very convincing.Jun Wu Xie looked at the books in hand if little lotus had not explained it to her, she really can\u2019t imagine these dilapidated gardening books actually turned out to be prized cultivation techniques!\u201cGrowing plants can enhance spiritual energy?\u201d Jun Wu Xie casually flipped through the topmost book.Little lotus nodded enthusiastically.\u201cWhat should I plant?\u201d She did not recognise any of the species of plants in the book.Little lotus immediately raised his hand and pointed to his nose.\u201cMe! \u00a0Plant me!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Jun Wu Xie was speechless. She also could not help but imagine a herself planting the lotus seeds in the earth and when it was harvest time\u2026 there were many many little lotuses. Only their heads were poking out of the earth while their body were still buried beneath. This was really quite a scene!\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d She shuddered for a moment.\u201cWell, as it states here, as long as you place me in a place with water, well, not me but my seeds and they will start to absorb, develop and grow and acc.u.mulate spiritual energy after which only you can absorb. When they grow into lotuses, although the effects isn\u2019t as great like me, eating them will have lots of benefits!\u201d Little lotus chirped merrily as he blinked his eyes which still had some tears attached to them.Jun Wu Xie felt that if he had a tail, he would be wagging it happily.It seems to be easier than the other types of techniques I\u2019ve come across?\u201d She had perused so many variety of \u00a0books and they were all rather complicated, some even nitpicked about the way you breathed! These books, on the other hand, were simple, straight to the point.All you needed to do was to plant flowers!Chapter 54: \u201cStrange Cultivation Technique (1)\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s currently out of reach for you.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jun Wu Xie pressed on as she raised her eyebrows.Little lotus dropped his head and his two little chubby hands grabbed his ap.r.o.n and whined: \u201cThose few guys can\u2019t come out yet\u2026 So it\u2019s out of reach for you.\u201dJun Wu Xie furrowed her eyebrows. What this little lotus was trying to say, was really difficult to understand. He always says things that were hard to comprehend.When he first appeared, he once said that his lotus seeds were eaten by some guy. And now from this little mouth if his he once again referred to some guys. Jun Wu Xie was referring curious to who those guys were.\u201cWho are they?\u201d\u201cContractual spirits\u2026\u2026\u201d Little lotus muttered.\u201cSo they have to wait for an owner first before they are able to come out?\u201d She asked.Little lotus nodded.. Then shook his head..frowned hard as he was trying to explain himself.Jun Wu Xue was even more puzzled.\u201cErm\u2026Uh..that.. Actually if Master practices hard and cultivates properly\u2026you\u2019re sure to be able to find the others\u2026 However as you are now\u2026. Isn\u2019t it better to grow my seeds first?\u201d Little lotus hesitated for a bit before looking nervously on at Jun Wu Xie and took two quick steps and stood in front of and raised his little head with a pitiful expression.\u201cMaster, you do not need to be in a hurry to find the other plants, ok? I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be of help to you, can you please start planting me first?\u201d Little lotus pleaded with his misty eyes.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Jun Wu Xie had a feeling that if she shook her head, he would start bawling.\u201cAlright.\u201d She affirmed.Little lotus immediately laughed and the whole room was filled with a sweet lotus scent.Jun Wu Xie started looking through the pile of musty old books, searching for one that had a water cultivation method.Previously she had thought that these were some regular gardening books however after little lotus\u2019s explanation, she noticed that the \u2018water\u2019 stated in the books were not regular water. The term \u201crootless water\u201d came out a few times and this \u201crootless water\u201d was the lowest grade and this was water that \u2018flowed out of heaven but have yet descended on earth\u2019, not the waters in the lakes and rivers.The book described various water plants, one of which was the snow lotus cultivation method.After reading that portion, Jun Wu Xie\u2019s face went black.To plant the snow lotus, one needed \u201cwater\u201d. To call it water was no longer feasible as the records \u00a0explicitly stated it needed the water from the heavenly spring.Heavenly spring? Jun Wu Xie searched through her memories of both worlds but to no avail. She has never heard of this or heard anyone else mention this heavenly spring before.Jun Wu Xie had always thought that there was always a balance in the world, her cultivation techniques were way simpler than others BUT the conditions were pretty tough. Who can tell her where can she find this heavenly spring?Do you know what is this heavenly spring water?\u201d She asked little lotus while frowning.Little lotus shook his head vigorously.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If the seeds were placed in regular water, the lotus will wilt and have no chance of recovery. In other words, if she placed the seeds in regular water, they will die.\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dSure enough, this troublesome lotus could not be raised with any regular water! In addition to the heavenly spring, she noted that another liquid that could plant the snow lotus was called \u2018jade nectar\u2019.In this world, this term meant that it was wine of the highest quality, even Jun Xian only ever had one chance to drink a small cup of this when the first Emperor had bestowed him a cup in celebration of winning the war.\u201cYou can even use wine to cultivate a plant\u2026hmmm.\u201d Jun Wu Xue rubbed between her\u00a0furrowed\u00a0brows to ease the tension as she was in deep thought. Although this wine was very precious and rare, at least she knew what it was. As for the heavenly spring, she\u2019s never heard of that before!Jade nectar was given by the First Emperor, this meant that there was a high chance that there\u2019s still some stored away in the Royal Palace.Jun Wu Xie thought back to the conversation she had with Jun Xian that day, it will soon be the Crown Prince\u2019s birthday celebration and she was invited as well. This would be a great opportunity to check if they still had this in the palace.Although she got her cultivation techniques on hand, however she was not able to start her cultivation due to the lack of resources.Just as she was pondering hard over the issues on the resources needed to kick start her cultivation, ever since they returned from Ghost City, Mo Xuan Fei and Bai Yun Xian\u2019s mood had hit rock bottom.Under the laws of Ghost City, Mo Xuan Fei could not do anything to that punk who made him lose his face completely! He gritted his teeth as he thought back on how hard he was trying to appease Bai Yun Xian after the whole incident at Ghost City. That young punk! How dare he cross his path like that? He had summoned the court painter urgently and had him draw out that kids face based on their description.Even though he could not touch him in Ghost City, once he\u2019s out, he won\u2019t let him off!Mo Xuan Fei mobilised his secret forces and had them comb through the entire Imperial City that very night.However, the strange thing was that no trace of that kid could be found. It was as if he mysteriously vanished into thin air.He even had his men stationed at the entrance of Ghost City to inform him once that kid was sighted, however, there wasn\u2019t any news at all.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..Time pa.s.sed quickly as the whole city was busy in preparation for the Crown Prince\u2019s birthday celebrations.Just the night before the birthday, Jun Xian called\u00a0Jun Qing and Jun Wu Xie over to his study.This time round, not only the \u2018waste\u2019 Jun Wu Xie was invited, even the \u2018dying\u2019 Jun Qing received an invitation.\u201cThe Crown Prince\u2019s birthday is tomorrow, both of you need to come along with me. Long Qi is not allowed in so Wu Xie, I\u2019ll leave the care of your uncle in your good hands.\u201d Jun Xian looked over at Jun Wu Xie with pride. His little girl had grown up to be so dependable and this was such an a.s.surance. Unknowingly he had placed all his hope of Lin Palace\u2019s future in this little girl\u2019s hands.\u201cAlright.\u201d Jun Wu Xie nodded.\u201cOne more thing, people outside do not know the condition of your uncle. As of now, they all still think that he has not much longer to live. If they find traces of his recovery, I\u2019m afraid\u2026 Wu Xie, can you ask your master if there is anyway to make your uncle seem \u2018terminally ill\u2019?\u201d Jun Xian was worried as he only received Jun Qing\u2019s invitation just five days prior to the Crown Prince\u2019s birthday.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Lin Palace had an additional two guests which made Jun Xian a little worried.Jun Wu Xie\u2019s invitation was due to the \u2018Emperor\u2019s grace\u2019 when he extended his invitation to her as an \u2018apology\u2019 for breaking the engagement.Whereas Jun Qing\u2019s invitation came late as it\u2019s since been more than a month since he was diagnosed and everyone that thought that he would die during this period. However no news of his expected death had spread and this made many restless.It seems that tomorrow\u2019s Crown Prince birthday banquet was not just a simple celebration.Many wanted to take this chance to probe Jun Qing\u2019s situation.\u201cHow\u2019s Uncle recovery during this period?\u201d Jun Wu Xie did not answer Jun Xian immediately as she did her usual check up routine, turning towards Jun Qing and checking on his recovery progress.Jun Qing\u2019s condition had improved drastically. After his blood had been cleansed and all the poison purged from his body, they had started the body conditioning stage. With all the acupuncture and medicines personally done by Jun Wu Xie, even his legs had both recovered and he could feel his legs again. Now, he\u2019s doing therapy to strengthen his leg muscles and training to start walking again. He\u2019s been practicing walking with crutches to aid his recovery.Although Jun Qing was struggling, as compared from before, this was a huge improvement.\u201cIt\u2019s much better than before, I think I may be able to walk in half a year\u2019s time.\u201d Jun Qing beamed brightly, as he chortled. This time of recovery had been the happiest time he had in a decade.\u201cEverything cannot be rushed, even if you are recovering well we cannot overdo it or else it would all be in vain.\u201d Jun Wu Xie warned Jun Qing.Although he looks very gentle and docile, when it comes to doing things, he was very resolute and aggressive and tended to push things to the extreme. This could be seen when he had been doing therapy lately and only until he collapsed and was carried back by Long Qi had he stopped practicing. Jun Wu Xie was called over many times due to this.Jun Wu Xie had to sternly remind Jun Qing or else his over enthusiasm might result in a backlash instead.Being nagged by his own niece Jun Qing laughed loudly as he slapped his legs in excitement, eyes filled with vigor, \u201cWu Xie, whatever you said I definitely understand\u2026It\u2019s just that for over ten years\u2026I\u2019ve been a cripple. For over ten years! Now I have this chance of walking again, I really can\u2019t wait. The feeling of being able to walk again, I don\u2019t think ordinary people can understand this.\u201dAfter he was crippled, the amount of ridicule and the humiliation he received was countless however the times he laughed could be counted easily. The despair he had felt were all washed away by this brilliant niece of his.The day when he will soar back into the sky is near and it would be payback time!\u201cTake it as if I didn\u2019t say anything then. I will add in more tonic for you.\u201d Jun Wu Xie had seen such over zealous patients before, however this post treatment therapy stage was not entirely her responsibility.Jun Qing was different from those other patients, she would not let anything happen to him no matter what.\u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard.\u201d Jun Qing looked warmly at Jun Wu Xie, in the past his fondness for this niece was because they had blood ties, but now he really loved this niece of his from the bottom of his heart.He wanted a speedy recovery so he could protect with his two hands, this family which was very dear to him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Tomorrow I will give something for uncle to take, it won\u2019t be detrimental to him, it just masks his health and let others view his pulse and his symptoms as though he is hanging on by a thread of life.\u201d She had long thought of this and had prepared in advance some pills that could act as a deterrent in the event of any emergency.Jun Xian and Jun Qing were glad that her master had such foresight and had everything prepared so comprehensively.It seemed this master of hers was determined to help their family.During this period of recuperation, Jun Qing was not only given back the use of his legs, his whole body had been strengthened and conditioned from inside out. On the other hand, Jun Xian\u2019s health had improved so much, his whole body had become more robust, his mind was sharper and clearer, his whole body was conditioned to its peak.\u201cYour master has contributed greatly to the Lin Palace, we are forever indebted to him.\u201d Jun Xian sighed, this elusive master of hers had helped their family so much yet he refused to show up or made any demands on them.\u201cHe does not care.\u201d Jun Wu Xie looked down wistfully while stroking the little black cat in her arms.All she could do now was to let Jun Xian and Jun Qing get more powerful. However that was not enough, she wanted to be more powerful herself, strong enough to wipe out all the enemies off the face of this earth.The day was soon over as everybody was busy preparing for the grand banquet. The sun rose and all the households were busy preparing for tonight\u2019s banquet. Horses brushed, carriages polished, lavish outfits donned on and as the sun began to set, the whole Imperial city was set abuzz as the streets were filled with the most luxurious carriages as they all went towards the Imperial Palace. With all the various carriages lined in front of the palace, all the various ministers had with them treasures from all over gathered here today to celebrate the Crown Prince\u2019s birthday.Jun\u2019s family carriage arrived grandly at the Palace gates. Long Qi was sitting outside the carriage as he looked coldly at the carriage coming over to the side.Wu w.a.n.g\u2019s extravagant carriage caught up with them, crystals clinking could be heard as Wu w.a.n.g stuck his head out of the crystal beaded curtain.\u201cWhy isn\u2019t it Lin w.a.n.g? What a coincidence!\u201d he sneered with his plump face and gave a greasy smile.Jun Xian drew his own carriage curtain and nodded.When Wu w.a.n.g saw the other two Jun family members in the carriage, he smiled even more.\u201cLittle highness and Wu Xie really came? Wow, it\u2019s going to be so boisterous, oh, but I wonder if his little highness\u2019s body can take it? Rest a.s.sured Lin w.a.n.g, based on our close relation, I\u2019ve already informed the servants to wait on him during the banquet, no need to worry!\u201d\u201cThank you for the arrangement.\u201d Jun Xian retorted curtly as he clenched his fist tightly and put the curtain down, not wanting to see that sickening face any longer.\u201cOh!\u201d Wu w.a.n.g contentedly shrank back into his own carriage as the crystals clinked together noisily.Within the carriage, Jun Wu Xie raised her head and asked. \u201cWhat filthy thing did that man eat?\u201d His mouth was really cheap.Jun Xian and his son immediately knew what she meant when she cursed that way as they smiled wryly.\u201cHe is the king\u2019s brother \u2013 Wu w.a.n.g, he doesn\u2019t have much skills so he relies heavily on his relations.h.i.+p to have things his way. He doesn\u2019t use his brain much, no need bother about him, he\u2019s just a waste. You have to remember that the real danger are those who hide their hostilities deep within and stab you in the back when you least expect it.\u201d Jun Qing was worried about Jun Wu Xie as she was still young and had not much experience with the real world.He really wanted to protect her from all danger if he could, to forever s.h.i.+eld her from this cold and deceptive world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Well, she must first give you an opportunity for that.In the past, she only trusted her back with one person. In this world, she wouldn\u2019t give anyone that chance other than Jun Xian and Jun Qing.Seeing that she understood his meaning, Jun Qing laughed.Sometimes he felt that his little niece grew up way too fast. Her perception and mentality seemed to have gone through an enormous change overnight \u2013 fortunately it was a good change.More and more carriages entered and dropped off various important Ministers of the State as the crowd trickled in to join in the celebration of the Crown Prince\u2019s birthday. While waiting to enter the banquet, all the guests entered from the side door and were ushered into a large waiting reception area.When it was finally their turn as the carriage arrived at the side door, Long Qi prepared the wheelchair, a.s.sisted Jun Qing and took a thin blanket to cover his legs.With the arrival of the three generations of the Jun Family, there was a huge commotion as many s.h.i.+fted their attention to the newly arrived guests.Jun Xian was like a sleeping tiger, although he had more wrinkles over the years, no one dared to underestimate him. By his side was a young maiden who was an alluring beauty. She was like a little flower bud which had yet to bloom. In a few years, she definitely would be a beauty that could topple nations! She seemed to grow more beautiful each time they saw her.In terms of appearance, very few could rival this precious flower from the Lin Palace, however everyone knew under this beautiful exterior lay a hot tempered fiery girl who could burn them easily and she brought trouble wherever she went! Jun Wu Xie\u2019s notoriety was known throughout, no one dared to treat her as a well behaved little rabbit!However now the one that they were most concerned about was the handsome man sitting on the wheelchair.Although he sat there quietly with his pale face, one could tell he had quite a bit of difficulty even breathing. His raspy and disorderly breathing could be heard, gripping people\u2019s hearts as they hear him struggling for his breath.It was known that Jun Qing was in a bad shape for quite some time and everyone speculated that he would have died after a few days when Jun Xian forced his way into the palace asking for all the Royal Doctors. With one look at Jun Qing today, one did not need to be well versed in medicine to tell that he was really hanging onto his life by a fine thread. Even if Jun Xian used up all the precious herbs, nothing would be able to save his son.Affirming their own notions, they looked over at Jun Xian and saw him brooding, this further confirmed their own speculation.Some ministers went over and offered him some words of encouragement, portraying a n.o.ble front and disappeared into the crowd soon after.This whole facade went on as both father and son played the victims and looked vulnerable. Jun Wu Xie on the other hand, was totally ignored.Compared to Jun Qing\u2019s imminent death, \u00a0being dumped by Mo Xuan Fei paled in comparison.Anyway the impending fall of Lin Palace was nearing, what can this outrageous tyrannical little girl do? She seemed to have toned down a lot from previous occasions. At least she knew her place \u2013 various inner thoughts and whisperings went around masked with bright smiles and vibrant music. Regardless of what\u2019s happening on the surface, everyone had deemed Lin Palace a huge joke.They had been in power for such a long time,showed their prowess before but all of that was in the past, now they were only waiting for their downfall.After pa.s.sing through the reception area, the guests were led to their seats in the banquet hall. Soon, it was in full swing as music, laughter and lantern lights filled the whole palace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The banquet was held at the Crown Prince Palace Wing and one could see that the Emperor really held the Crown Prince birthday in high regard. The main hall was decorated lavishly and the feast itself was pure luxury. Silk brocades with exquisite embroidery could be seen all around as beautifully carved wine gla.s.ses out of precious materials graced their presence. The finest dishes were brought out with rare and delectable ingredients in beautiful artistic designs were presented to the guests.For this banquet alone, how much gold was splurged?Jun Wu Xie was pus.h.i.+ng Jun Qing on the wheelchair, following quietly behind Jun Xian as they entered the banquet hall. A small memory flashed by, in the past, the previous Wu Xie had attended the Crown Prince\u2019s birthday once and that was the time when she had met Mo Xuan Fei and fell for him.\u201cThe Crown Prince doesn\u2019t have it easy as well.\u201d Jun Wu Xie looked at the grandeur surrounding her as she coldly stated her thoughts.Jun Xian and Jun Qing\u2019s expression stiffened.Jun Qing was about to say something when Jun Xian suddenly cut it and said: \u201cWu Xie, why do you think so?\u201dJun Wu Xie replied: \u201cIf his Majesty really loved the Crown Prince, he would create an image of a benevolent ruler that doesn\u2019t spend the people\u2019s money in such ways. The way I see it, it\u2019s not the case.\u201d\u201cThe Crown Prince\u2019s abode is so luxurious and just for a banquet such extravagance splashed out isn\u2019t it just for all to see?\u201d She stated everything very matter of factly, in front of her this beautiful scene was just like an invisible shackle.Jun Xian widened his eyes in shock, he did not think that the young Wu Xie could see through the secret.Jun Xian glanced at the servants walking in front of them as he whispered softly: \u201cHis Royal Crown Prince was born by the Queen, her own family was very powerful which enabled her to sit on the Queen\u2019s throne. In just a few years after her death, her family also faced an unexpected calamity and their power declined tremendously.\u201dJun Wu Xie finally understood, the only reason why the Crown Prince could hold on to his t.i.tle was because of his Mother\u2019s side of the family, not because the Emperor favoured him. From the look of things, with the decline of the Crown Prince\u2019s support, the Emperor seemed to have started making his move.To say the least, the current Crown Prince\u2019s predicament was similar to Lin Palace.Without a powerful backing, the Emperor who was previously helpless before them had his own designs.However his schemes really ran deep, even when dealing with the Crown Prince, he portrays it as if he doted heavily on this son of his.\u201cThen who does His Majesty actually favor?\u201d Jun Wu Xie asked softly.\u201cThe Second Prince.\u201d Jun Xian answered coldly.Jun Wu Xie suddenly realised how everything fell into place. No wonder Mo Xuan Fei was so persistent on pursuing Bai Yun Xian, her ident.i.ty itself could boost him up to take over the coveted position of Crown Prince. If they were engaged, it was a great opportunity\u00a0to make the favored son the Crown Prince instead.\u201cHe have eyes but fail to see, how ignorant.\u201d she scoffed.Although she did not know the Crown Prince very well, however in the eyes of Jun Wu Xie, Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s personality was rotten to the core.Even a lump of **** was better than Mo Xuan Fei.Jun Xian laughed, although his little princess did not talk much, her mouth was really quite toxic.After all the ministers have arrived and sat at their seats, the Emperor turned to his right and whispered something to the handsome youth seated by his side.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was donned in a silver silk brocade, however he was dressed quite casually for the occasion as compared to all his guests, with his inner snow white robe peeking out. He was sitting idly with a wine cup in hand.Although the feast had yet to start, he had already drank a lot, his eyes seemed to be intoxicated but there was still a hint of sharpness.At first glance, Jun Wu Xie felt something was amiss with the Crown Prince but she said nothing and continued sitting quietly at her seat.On the other side of the Emperor sat the Second Prince, Mo Xuan Fei was seated with his beautiful lady companion, Bai Yun Xian. The golden couple was smiling and in high spirits as their laughter added to the festive mood.When viewed from the hall, the contrast between the Crown Prince and Second Prince was apparent.A beautiful cue presented by the court musicians invited the Emperor to make a toast. Mo Xuan Fei straightened his back and gave a congratulatory speech to his brother and expressed grat.i.tude for everyone\u2019s presence and gifts.The main lead tonight, Crown Prince Mo Qian Yuan had been silent throughout, sitting at his own corner drinking his wine.\u201cQian Yuan, today is your birthday, when you were just born, when\u00a0you and your mum were in grave danger, luckily Jun Gu saved you both! Today, Lin w.a.n.g, Jun Qing and Jun Wu Xie are all present, why don\u2019t you take the opportunity and give a toast to them.\u201d The Emperor smiled and asked the silent Mo Qian Yuan.Mo Qian Yuan frowned deeper as he contemplated for a short while before taking his wine cup and got up, trying to stabilise himself. He seemed to be a bit drunk as he staggered over.A lot of ministers secretly shook their heads. People were really not optimistic about this future king as they inwardly judged him.Mo Qian Yuan held out his cup: \u201cThank you Lin Palace for your grace.\u201d Without waiting for any response, he downed his whole cup of wine in a single swig.His actions were very brash and sudden that he lost his balance and tumbled towards the table.Jun Xian helped the Crown Prince up as the strong smell of alcohol a.s.saulted his nose. Jun Xian couldn\u2019t help but let out a sigh softly.\u201cSorry.\u201d Mo Qian Yuan straightened himself as he frowned and tapped his head absentmindedly as he muttered a few more words and went back to his seat.Jun Wu Xie looked at him as a glint flashed by her deep eyes.\u201cMeow!\u201d Faint meowing came from her sleeves.Before entering the banquet, the little black cat had hid itself in her large sleeves, fortunately it was very small and it had gone in unnoticed.[Master, that man has something nasty on him!]The little black cat had an extraordinary sense of smell and with a whiff of the strong alcoholic smell from the Crown Prince, it sniffed up something bad along with it.\u201cMmm.\u201d Jun Wu Xie sat there without moving, the reason which why she herself had an ultra sensitive nose was mainly due to her soul link with the little black cat. In her previous world, this deed was due to that person\u2019s extreme experiments and had her increase her sense of smell by few times, although it was nothing compared to what the little black cat, it was still much more sensitive than an ordinary person\u2019s.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the previous world, there was a type of flower and the extract of that flower could be made into a type of drug. If a person was taking that drug, their clothes would have this faint floral scent on them.After taking this drug, it would make people all floaty and happy, throwing all their problems away. If taken long-term, it could change a person\u2019s mental capacity. If a person ate it for an extended period, he would turn into a waste very quickly as the drug not only damage a person\u2019s nerves, it also corroded their organs. Moreover, it was highly addictive and if not taken on time, it was as though there were hundreds of ants on them and this extreme discomfort could even cause personality disorders.Jun Wu Xie did not think that such a vile drug had existed in this world as well and what made her even more surprised was that this scent came from the Crown Prince!Looking at his disorderly state, it seems that it was not simply excessive drinking of wine but more related to that flower scent emitted.\u201cThe period of him taking the drug seems to be for quite some time.\u201d She touched her chin as she a.s.sessed it based on her experience. It seems that he had been taking this drug for a few years, he can\u2019t drag this on for much longer. If he continues, it is estimated he had only two more years left.It made no difference to her if he lived or died.However, the Emperor can justify his death and use it as a means to raise the Second Prince, Mo Xuan Fei.This was something she did not want.\u201cThis man cannot die.\u201d She decided immediately as she narrowed her eyes in determination. It may also be a great opportunity to help a desolate prince and perhaps he may prove useful to change the current State of Qi.Well, whatever makes her enemy unhappy, she\u2019ll be more than happy to lend a helping hand.\u201cGrandfather, father saved the prince\u2019s life before?\u201d She asked softly.\u201cThat was a long time ago, your father had just taken over the command of Rui Lin Army. That year, the Crown Prince was born and the Queen was on the way to bring him to visit her family. They met with bandits on the way, luckily your father happened to be in the vicinity and he saved them.\u201d Jun Xian casually replied.\u201cMo Qian Yuan\u2019s performance had been pretty good, however, over the past few years he seemed to have undergone a personality change. If he really becomes the King of Qi, perhaps our Lin Palace might not have such a hard time.\u201d Jun Xian sighed, the only promising Crown Prince was now also at stake.Jun Xian and his sons had saved too many people before, hence he didn\u2019t say much more.Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes as she looked at the Crown Prince.From the memory of the previous Wu Xie, she could only find a little bit of rumours on him. Mo Qian Yuan was born six months earlier than Mo Xuan Fei, as the Emperor\u2019s eldest son, once he was born, he was given the t.i.tle of Crown Prince. When he was young, the common folk had all said that he was talented, modest, mindful and polite, many sang praises of him. At that time, the Emperor too had doted on him and everyone praised him.All these of course was when the Queen was still around and her family was a large faction that had lots of power. She was still in charge of the harem then.With the pa.s.sing of the Queen, the whole country was mourning and Mo Qian Yuan fell terribly ill for three whole months and after his recovery, his temperament had undergone major changes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Are you feeling better?\u201d The Emperor smiled gently at Jun Qing.Jun Qing sat weakly on the wheelchair and as he tried to speak, his breathing became chaotic and he started gasping for his breath.The Emperor\u2019s face changed immediately and quickly said: \u201cQuick! Imperial Doctors quickly go have a look!\u201dUpon the Emperor\u2019s order, the two Imperial Doctors on standby quickly rushed over to Jun Qing\u2019s side and attended to him.During the whole process, Jun Qing\u2019s face was pale and his breathing was very faint.Jun Wu Xie sat there quietly sipping her tea looking at the two doctors taking the pulse of her uncle.This uncle of hers was not bad, he added quite a clever touch. The purpose of the Emperor\u2019s invitation to Jun Qing was clear as day. When the Emperor started probing, Jun Qing immediately gave him this opportunity.Jun Qing\u2019s situation was no different from the previous time they had taken his pulse. His pulse was very weak and his breath was faint\u2026 his life seemed to be so fragile and could be extinguished any moment.After both the physicians thoroughly checked, they whispered amongst themselves and turned towards the Emperor with a serious tone, said: \u201cPlease pardon us, but we are unable to resolve this for his highness. We can only advise his highness to rest as much as he can and do not cause any unnecessary strain on the heart.\u201d They were very subtle in their diagnosis.The two Imperial Doctors were helpless and with their diagnosis, Jun Qing was already deemed dead.The mood was heavy as all the ministers showed a face of regret and remorse, a total different emotion from what they were feeling inside.\u201cGo prepare some Ginseng.\u201d The Emperor ordered as he gave out a long sigh, giving the impression of a helpless enlightened ruler, he turned to Jun Xian and said: \u201cIf there is anything you need, just feel free to speak out. Since today Bai Yun Xian is also present, how about we let her have a look as well?\u201dJun Xian got up respectfully: \u201cThis humble one is touched and very thankful for Your Majesty\u2019s grace!\u201dThe Emperor nodded and Bai Yun Xian who was seated beside Mo Xuan Fei got up from her seat and walked over to take Jun Qing\u2019s pulse.Jun Wu Xie rested her chin on her hand and looked at the approaching Bai Yun Xian, her eyes flashed an icy cold glint.\u201cMeow.\u201d[This old fool is really disgusting, if he had truly wanted to save your uncle, he should have asked Bai Yun Xian to have a look earlier. What use is there to ask her come now?] The little black cat sneered as it puffed it\u2019s chest up unhappily. It naturally sided Jun Wu Xie\u2019s family and was lamenting on the unfair treatment they received.\u201cShe\u2019s not here to see if she\u2019s able to save him but to check whether is he really dying.\u201d Jun Wu Xie calmly a.s.sessed. The Emperor thought that he was so smart but to her he was hopelessly stupid.Want to use Bai Yun Xian to check on Jun Qing? He really regarded that woman too highly.Qing Yun Clan\u2019s disciple? So what? In her eyes they were nothing but a joke.Bai Yun Xian carried an air of aloofness as she covered his wrist with a thin cloth and tapped his wrist gently and took his pulse.Jun Xian was nervous as he looked at Bai Yun Xian.She was after all not an ordinary doctor but from the famed Qing Yun Clan. He was not sure of how good her abilities were as he had not witnessed them for himself but he knew they had to take this gamble.His heart was filled with anxiety but when he looked over at Jun Wu Xie, he was surprised that his own granddaughter was preoccupied with the teacup in her hands and too lazy to even look at Bai Yun Xian.With Jun Wu Xie\u2019s calmness, Jun Xian had a little peace of mind.Shortly after, Bai Yun Xian straightened herself with a cold and aloof expression: \u201cThe Imperial Doctors\u2019 diagnosis was not wrong, my Master had tried his best to neutralise his poison but if my Master can\u2019t even clear his poison, I\u2019m afraid no one can. It is already a miracle that my Master managed to suppress the poison for so many years.\u201d After singing praises of her master, she proudly glanced around the hall.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Those with sharp eyes noted his hands holding onto his wine cup was trembling.Looks like Jun Qing\u2019s condition was really hopeless, look, even Jun Xian\u2019s hands were shaking! Indeed his hands were trembling but it never crossed their minds that it was not due to grief but due to him holding back his own laughter.If it wasn\u2019t for the situation at hand, he could not wait to shout out to the whole world and tell them that his son\u2019s poison had already been completely cleared by his brilliant granddaughter! Not only that, his son would soon be able to walk again! Qing Yun Clan\u2026was simply.. to simply put it they were simply ****!!!Just his granddaughter alone could clear the poison that the Qing Yun Clan\u2019s Sovereign deemed hopeless, under the guidance of an esteemed master. This Bai Yun Xian actually had the audacity to say that her Master\u2019s solution was the best and if he could not cure it, no one else could! Hmph!Previously he had admired the Qing Yun Clan fervently, however after seeing with his own eyes how his granddaughter easily did\u00a0what their Sovereign could not accomplish, he had lost all his respect for the clan and scoffed at them instead.Other than his family\u2019s Wu Xie, who else dares to say that they are best in the world?!Jun Xian looked around at the reaction of the crowd and swore in his heart that after the comeback of his Lin Palace, he would make these guys know where they stand! He couldn\u2019t wait to see their expressions after they knew the truth!For now, he played a distraught man.Jun Wu Xie simply admired her own grandfather and uncle for their acting skills and gave them full points.After completing the task, Bai Yun Xian went back to the Second Prince\u2019s side. He immediately looked at her gently and said: \u201cYun Xian, you\u2019ve worked hard.\u201dBai Yun Xian smiled sweetly back.\u201cYou really are a romantic at heart dear brother, looks like your feelings run deep.\u201d The silent Crown Prince suddenly spoke up, with a pair of sharp eyes staring intently at Mo Xuan Fei.\u201cBig Brother, you really know how to joke.\u201d He did not know why his brother suddenly praised them.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if this romantic you is a bit too irresponsible, favouring the new over the old is not the style of our Royal Family. Now here you are acting all lovey dovey with Miss Bai, have you ever thought about the feelings of others?\u201d Mo Qian Yuan sneered.Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s face stiffened.Even a fool knew what Mo Qing Yuan meant as all eyes subconsciously s.h.i.+fted to Jun Wu Xie who had been neglected the whole night.The infamous lady in question was surprisingly really quiet tonight, if not for the Crown Prince mentioning her, everyone had almost forgotten about her presence.Mo Xuan Fei and Jun Wu Xie were betrothed, however after the appearance of Bai Yun Xian, Mo Xuan Fei no longer met up much with Jun Wu Xie and not long ago, the Emperor even broke their engagement.When their engagement was broken off, the incident sparked a major uproar that spread beyond the State of Qi. Everyone had been antic.i.p.ating the trouble she would bring with her, however she had instead remained low-key and disappeared for such a long time. In fact, this was the first time people had seen her after that incident.Although she was more beautiful now, somehow they felt that there was something different about her from the past.In the whole country, it could be said that she was one of the finest beauties. However with her brash,fiery,rude and arrogant personality it conflicted with her outward appearance. Today she was sitting quietly in the corner made her seem like totally different person!Misty ramblings: In the beginning it was emphasized that she was not a beauty however it changed after awhile. My guess is that\u2026 after she went through the whole lotus seed conditioning, her complexion had improved and she looked fresher too. In many other novels usually such changes will let them have virtually poreless skin almost akin to a baby\u2019s skin. So think models without the photoshop and without makeup.Also her demeanor is now different so the charisma she exudes now makes her more poise. And also she\u2019s still growing, there\u2019s this chinese saying \u201c\u5973\u4eba\u5341\u516b\u53d8\u201d which if you do a search these are the literal :a girl changes eighteen times between childhood and womanhood (idiom) and not so literal:\u00a0girl changes fast in physical appearance from childhood to adulthood.Also, it had been emphasized over and over again how horrid the previous Wu Xie\u2019s character was so perhaps her personality really was so bad that her beauty did not matter.

She was austere and alone in a world of her own.Elegant, pure and transcendent beauty were words that immediately appeared in their minds.Those words which were initially tailored for Bai Yun Xian now seemed to fit her better.Her reserved demeanor made her unapproachable but made one\u2019s heart long to keep looking at her.Although they hate to admit it but truthfully, the quiet Jun Wu Xie no matter in terms of demeanour or charm had risen significantly.She had been very low-key, too low in fact that people had almost forgotten all about her but after placing her in sight and noticing her subtle changes, they could not help but be attracted to her.Sneaking a peek at Jun Wu Xie and s.h.i.+fting their gazes to Bai Yun Xian\u2026Bai Yun Xian didn\u2019t seem to be as elegant as they had previously thought.It looks like the real ice cold elegant G.o.ddess position would be given to Jun Wu Xie. It was time for Bai Yun Xian to step down.\u201cQian Yuan, you are drunk.\u201d The Emperor frowned, he did not understand why the usually silent Crown Prince would suddenly speak up for Jun Wu Xie. He clearly remembered that this was only the second time they had met and previously when they met, Mo Qian Yuan did not have a good impression of her.\u201cAh, yes, I\u2019m drunk. Your son had drank too many cups of wine, I\u2019ve let Imperial Father seen something funny. Please allow me to go back and rest first.\u201d Mo Qian Yuan straightened himself up as he let out a faint smile.\u201cGo.\u201d The Emperor bellowed.Mo Qian Yuan no longer hesitated and immediately got up, raising his hand and waving away the servants who wanted to a.s.sist him. He narrowed his eyes as he hissed: \u201cI still can walk myself, no one is to allowed to touch me!\u201dThe manner which the Crown Prince left had instilled discontent in many.Jun Wu Xie looked at his departing back as she pondered for a while amidst the toasts that were going on around, she spoke to her Uncle in a soft tone: \u201cUncle, I want to go out for some fresh air.\u201dJun Qing was surprised for a moment, thinking back on how this niece of his was devoted to Mo Xuan Fei and looking at how lovey dovey he was with Bai Yun Xian now, she must be feeling miserable. He sighed loudly and said: \u201cGo have a walk around but do not leave this Palace Wing. Don\u2019t stay out too long.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cWu Xie.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be so sad over Mo Xuan Fei. He does not deserve you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Jun Wu Xie\u2019s steps froze midway.How did he come to that conclusion? Which eye did he use and see that she was upset over that sc.u.m Mo Xuan Fei?The moonlight streamed into the garden and brightly illuminated the pavilion which Mo Qian Yuan was as he chugged down wine straight from the jug. He was sitting on the stone chair as he smiled bitterly by himself.\u201cIf you want to die early, go ahead and drink more!\u201d A tender voice with a coldness broke the tranquility of the still night.Mo Qian Yuan was very surprised. Under the moonlight, a beautiful young maiden dressed in a lovely yellow silk brocade holding a little black cat in her arms stood there. Surrounded by flowers and with the moonlight gently s.h.i.+ning on her body, her delicate features against the surreal background, she looked like a fairy that had descended into the mortal realm.\u201cJun Wu Xie?\u201d Mo Qian Yuan\u2019s lips curved upwards as he looked at her in a drunken stupor.\u201cI was still wondering who had the audacity to curse me, the Crown Prince to die early?\u201dJun Wu Xie walked towards the pavilion, as the stench of alcohol a.s.saulted her. She stopped just before entering the pavilion.\u201cEven if I don\u2019t mention it, you will also die\u2026moreover\u2026how long more will you be able to stay as the Crown Prince?\u201d She replied icily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He seemed to have transformed into a panther that was waiting in the dark ready to pounce onto it\u2019s prey.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d His eyes had a dangerous glint in them.Jun Wu Xie casually stroked the fur of the little black cat, without even looking up, she said icily: \u201cSome people do not want you to continue being the Crown Prince and are hoping for you to have an early demise. If you also think the same way and want to find an earlier release, just hit your head here against the stone table, no need to waste everybody\u2019s time.\u201dMo Qian Yuan\u2019s mouth twitched slightly. He had always thought that she was a little outrageous but he just realised he had thoroughly underestimated her after experiencing her poison tongue first hand.This little girl, couldn\u2019t she say things properly? Did she need to say it in such a manner?\u201cThis kind of words can\u2019t be said so carelessly, I\u2019ll just take it as I didn\u2019t hear this.\u201d He rubbed his wrinkled brows.\u201cCareless words? Well, since I\u2019m already saying it I might as well continue. If you want to avenge your Mother and your maternal family, you have to live and keep your position as Crown Prince.\u201d She slowly looked up with eyes that were filled with intensity looked at him straight which startled him.\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d His eyes had a trace of panic in them.\u201cI know that you are a coward and a waste.\u201d Jun Wu Xie raised her eyebrows.\u201cYou!\u201d Mo Qian Yuan was infuriated, he should not have spoken up for her just now!\u201cIf you are not willing, then find all means and ways to survive. If not just raise your hands and surrender.\u201d She retorted.Mo Qian Yuan sucked in a deep breath, this little girl really knew where to stab where it hurts the most! As he had been drinking wine prior to this, he was light headed when he felt a sudden rush to his head. He stood up and flung his jug of wine into the floor.It shattered into pieces as the strong smell of wine permeated the surroundings.\u201cYou think I want this? Huh? Do you think I asked for it? So what about the t.i.tle of Crown Prince? Hah! I don\u2019t even want anything! My life, my position, they all don\u2019t belong to me! Even my own father wants me dead! Everyone thinks that I\u2019m an incompetent Prince! Who else in this world can save me? So what if I\u2019m not willing? What can I do about it?\u201dHe yelled with bloodshot eyes as he unravelled everything that had been plaguing him deep within. All the years of bottled up emotions came forth like a gus.h.i.+ng spring.\u201cYou\u2019re right! I\u2019m going to die soon! Going to die! What else can I do about it? I\u2019m almost as good as dead! Tell me, what can I do?!!!\u201dJun Wu Xie looked at him coldly as he flung about and wallowed.\u201cWhat if you do not need to die?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d He looked at her wide eyed. It was as though a sudden jolt of lightning had struck him.\u201cWell, to be more precise, not only do you not die, in fact you won\u2019t die in the next few years or decades.\u201d She corrected her own words.\u201cYou\u2026you\u2026what do you mean?\u201d He swallowed his saliva as he asked nervously, not daring to hear what he had wished for most.Jun Wu Xie did not bother answering him as she impatiently said: \u201cYou\u2019ve been poisoned right?\u201d\u201cHow did you know?\u201d What was this little girl?! He was very surprised.She furrowed her brows. She really wasn\u2019t very good at explanations, might as well spend the time proving it instead.\u201cLittle Black, hold him down.\u201d She said as she suddenly threw the little black cat in her arms out.Under the bright moonlight, the little black cat which was the size of her hand suddenly transformed \u2013 It\u2019s body grew bigger in an instant and it became huge and strong panther as it pounced onto Mo Qian Yuan.The unsuspecting Mo Qian Yuan who was standing there just moments before was now pinned onto the ground by a huge black panther.

In a very practiced and swift manner, she opened his mouth and shoved a pill in as she closed his mouth and hit his chest. It happened in seconds, it was simply fast and accurate.Before he could even react, he had swallowed whatever she had thrown in.\u201cWha\u2026What are you up to\u2026.?\u201d He looked at her with bloodshot eyes as he felt his heart palpitating quickly.

The huge panther opened its mouth wide as it gave a warning growl and lowered its head as it positioned Mo Qing Yuan\u2019s neck between it\u2019s sharp teeth.\u201cIf he utters a single word, feel free to bite him.\u201d She said emotionlessly as she gave the panther the order.The black panther stood there motionless as it stared at the man beneath it.Mo Qing Yuan\u2019s mind was distraught as he thought to himself. This was the worst birthday ever. Tonight must be one of the most depressing nights he ever had, to think that he actually let a little girl pull a fast one over him!Under the threat of the panther, he slowly closed his eyes, as he reluctantly began to accept his own fate.Sure enough, he really is a good for nothing. He gave up so easily. He did not dare move a single muscle.Time ticked by slowly, Mo Qian Yuan felt that the discomfort he had, all the p.r.i.c.kly sensations, all that disgusting feeling of ants crawling all over him for all these years seemed to be subsiding.He flung his eyes wide open as he looked at Jun Wu Xie with a shocked expression.\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d\u201cROAR!\u201d The panther issued another warning as it tightened it\u2019s grip on his neck.Jun Wu Xie glanced over and said: \u201cLittle Black, let him go.\u201dAs soon as she uttered those words, Mo Qian Yuan felt the pressure on him suddenly released as the huge figure swooped towards Jun Wu Xie and a cute little black cat once again appeared in her arms.\u201cMeow.\u201d[Ugh, his whole body reeks! It stinks of alcohol! The stench is killing me!]Jun Wu Xie gently stroked it\u2019s fur lovingly.\u201cIt..no\u2026You\u2026What did you feed me with? Why am I\u2026?

With this sudden soberness, it had happened too suddenly that he did not know what to ask.\u201cSomething that can save your life.\u201d Jun Wu Xie felt that this approach was much simpler as results could be seen quickly.Mo Qian Yuan looked deeply at her, his fingers slightly as he asked in a low voice: \u201cWhy do you want to help me\u201dJun Wu Xie replied very matter of factly: \u201cI want you to fight against your father and Mo Xuan Fei. I want you to ascend the throne so that you can keep my Jun Family safe.\u201dThe position of the Emperor should have been changed long ago as the current Emperor will die, Mo Xuan Fei too. Since the country needs a ruler, she will choose one that would protect her family.\u201cYou want me to usurp the throne?!\u201d Mo Qing Yuan was completely shocked.

Just mind your own problems. If you want to live and exact your revenge, you have to accept the condition. If you want to die, I will not force you. That pill you ate just now can only relieve your discomfort temporarily, there\u2019s too much toxins acc.u.mulated in your blood stream so we need more time to completely clear it.\u201d She explained.Mo Qing Yuan took a deep breath, he knew he had no choice as he\u2019s been backed into a corner by his own family already. He still had to avenge this blood feud! Who cares what condition she threw at him, even if he had to brave through fire and h.e.l.l he\u2019d do it!\u201cI agree.\u201d He made this life changing decision instantly.\u201cVery good, next time you\u2019ll have to find some reason to meet up with me, I will slowly get rid of all the poison.\u201d She looked at him in the eye before turning around as she softly said: \u201cMo Qian Yuan, you won\u2019t regret this choice you made today.\u201dShe carried the little black cat in her arms as she went back towards the banquet hall.Looking to her fading back, he clenched his fist tightly trying to suppress all the emotions that he was feeling now. Over the years, he had felt that his soul and mind had slowly breaking down into many pieces and he even considered giving up. Never had he thought that this day was possible. He felt that today he had finally found back a small piece of himself and was determined to recover back all that he had lost.Jun Wu Xie, no matter what you want, as long as you help me accomplish what I want to do, this life of mine belongs to you!In Jun Wu Xie\u2019s arm, Little Black was swis.h.i.+ng its tail excitedly.\u201cMeow.\u201d[Its been such a long time since I\u2019ve transformed\u2026 I\u2019m still not really used to it. Say, Master, how did you know that the Emperor was the one behind the Queen\u2019s death? How did you also know that it was the Emperor that destroyed her family?]Little Black was certain that it did not hear such news from Jun Xian and Jun Qing, so how did she acquire such privileged information?\u201cI did not know.\u201d[What?]\u201cI said it casually.\u201d She answered calmly.She slipped back into the banquet as she sat there quietly.The Emperor sat on his throne as he was enjoying himself as he talked and laughed loudly among the various ministers. The banquet was heating up as the music and dance carried on through the night.As the main star of the party, Mo Qian Yuan had actually left in the midst of it, giving Mo Xuan Fei a chance to perform his perfect king candidate role. He and Bai Yun Xian entertained the various ministers and was every bit the golden couple everyone was talking about. They had completely ignored Jun Wu Xie, on the other hand, the one who kept sneaking glances to see if she was alright was Jun Qing who was worried that she was heartbroken.However, the facts proved that Jun Qing\u2019s theory was all wrong.Throughout the rest of the banquet, Jun Wu Xie did not even bother to look at the couple.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just right after his banquet, the very next morning using the pretext of \u2018Wu Xie and I really hit it off\u2019 as the reason, he invited Jun Wu Xie to the palace.The biggest reaction came from Jun Xian and Jun Qing. They did not understand why did Mo Qing Yuan suddenly invited Jun Wu Xie over, what was even more surprising was that Jun Wu Xie had expressed her intention of accepting the invite. They could only helplessly let her go as she pleased.It was noon as Jun Wu Xie sat across Mo Qing Yuan in his study, with one hand on his wrist, taking his pulse.\u201cYour grandfather actually let you come?\u201d Mo Qing Yuan asked with an incredulous tone as he propped his chin with the other hand looking at Jun Wu Xie who was concentrating on his pulse.Lately the Royal Family had not been too kind towards Lin Palace, with such strained tension in the air, he was surprised that Jun Xian had allowed Jun Wu Xie to come alone.Jun Wu Xie did not look up as she continued on with her diagnosis: \u201cWith a prince that is deemed a good for nothing, what\u2019s there to be afraid of.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Mo Qing Yuan\u2019s mouth twitched slightly, this little girl\u2019s mouth was really poisonous. He glanced over at the \u2018little\u2019 black cat that was curled up on her feet as he recalled everything that happened last night. He involuntarily gulped as he still had lingering\u00a0fear of that black fur ball as his heart pounded faster.\u201cCome to think about it, if I had a strong enough backing and held quite a bit of power, Lin w.a.n.g would surely stop you from making any contact with me to avoid arousing any suspicion. However my status now is that of a Crown Prince that\u2019s going to lose his own crown, no smart person would want to have anything to do with me.\u201d He chuckled.Lin palace held half of the country\u2019s military might and if they formed close ties with the Crown Prince, at first glance, this was a very powerful alliance.However if thought through carefully, it was a sinking s.h.i.+p with two ailing tigers on it.\u201cCan you guess\u2026 What reason did I tell him that made him consent to your visit?\u201d Mo Qian Yuan looked at her with a pair of bright eyes. Privately, he did not want to call that man Imperial Father.Jun Wu Xie ignored him as she continued on what she was doing.Mo Qian Yuan continued excitedly: \u201cI told him that I fell in love with you.\u201dJun Wu Xie finally raised her head, but her eyes had not the slightest trace of surprise in them. She just looked at him with a pair of clear eyes.\u201cSo, you are prepared to let him think that you have caught interest in someone that was discarded by Mo Xuan Fei?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d \u00a0When she said this, he was completely defeated and lost all reason to retort her. Mo Qing Yuan laughed bitterly as he looked at her dumbfoundedly.\u201cDo you always speak like that? Do you always speak in such a ruthless manner even to yourself?\u201d Why was she so hard even to herself? Using terms like \u2018discarded\u2019 so easily on herself. Mo Qing Yuan felt that his brother was really stupid and the biggest mistake was letting go of Jun Wu Xie.The past Jun Wu Xie may not have been that great but the Jun Wu Xie that was sitting across him now was the most intriguing woman he has ever met. Well, more accurately\u2026 young maiden.A girl that dared to make a prince yield and even forced him to usurp the throne, what kind of guts did she possess?\u201cI\u2019m just stating the facts.\u201d She replied.Mo Qing Yuan chuckled, shaking his head in exasperation. He really could not read her.\u201cDuring my birthday banquet when I had spoken up for you, all I wanted was to spite him. Who would have known that it\u2019s the perfect cover now?\u201d He chortled as he thought back to the expression that the Emperor had when he had told him about his feelings towards Jun Wu Xie. That look was priceless.\u201cThe two people that he wants to get rid of most are now paired up, he should be so happy, right? Now he can kill two birds with one stone, won\u2019t that be much easier?\u201d He laughed at the very irony of it all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You\u2019ve been poisoned for quite a long time, as for your body, I can treat it and have you well again. However, I\u2019m unable to determine the source of the poison. To completely rid yourself from this, you\u2019ll have to find out it and eliminate it to prevent this or else you will be caught up in this mess again.\u201dAlthough this man was nearing death\u2019s door, how come he still had so many thoughts? He had been going at it for almost half a day as he chattered on incessantly.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Mo Qian Yuan was rendered speechless once again. This girl had regarded everything he talked about as \u2018noise\u2019.In the end what was up with her? She was the very person who asked him to seize the throne but she was not interested one bit in how he did it?\u201cYou\u2026..\u201d\u201cHow you want to go about it is your problem, I\u2019m only a doctor.\u201d She looked at him with a blank expression.Mo Qian Yuan threw his head back in laughter.This missy of the Lin Palace was really something! How old was she only? She\u2019s so young but she could be so calm and collected, more than that, her thoughts ran so deep. Yes, she was absolutely right. How he went about it was his own problem. If he succeeded, Lin Palace would be celebrated and hailed as loyal supporters. If he failed, he would be the only one to bear the consequences, he had no relations.h.i.+p between Lin Palace and Jun Wu Xie.\u201cJun Wu Xie, you\u2019re really smart and can be so cruel at the same time.\u201d He laughed wryly.Jun Wu Xie looked at him, not easing any of her wrinkled brows.\u201cMeow.\u201d[Master, he must have misunderstood what you meant! This imbecile\u2026]For Little Black, it had been with Wu Xie for the longest time and it understood Wu Xie the most. It very clearly knew that she had no other meaning when she said that. She definitely wasn\u2019t scheming anything like what the idiot Prince was thinking about. All she really meant was that these things would be better handled by the Prince who was more experienced in these matters. Now all that she needed to do most was to get him back in shape so that he could put up a good fight.The Crown Prince who had been brought up in the tangled Royal Palace where schemes ran amok so frequently as if having a regular meal, his way of thinking was conditioned to survive in such a treacherous place.To simply put it, they were on two totally different wavelengths.This little misunderstanding had caused Mo Qian Yuan to have the impression that Jun Wu Xie was a very resourceful and an adept natural-born conspirator for a long, long, time to come in the future.Not wanting Mo Qian Yuan to have any further strange thoughts, Jun Wu Xie reb.u.t.ted: \u201cStop talking so much nonsense. If you want to live properly, you\u2019ll have to find the source of the poison.\u201dMo Qian Yuan sighed softly: \u201cTruth be told, when my body was getting weaker by the day, I had also faintly guessed that I may have been poisoned. In fact, only after you asked me last night was when I finally confirmed my suspicion. I do not know the source of the poison as well.\u201d He smiled bitterly, if he knew what the source was, he wouldn\u2019t let himself be in such a dire situation.Jun Wu Xie took out a small porcelain bottle and handed it over to him. \u201cYou\u2019ve been poisoned by the wheat night flower. Drink this and if you\u2019re in contact with any extract of this flower, you will have a reaction.\u201d To find the source of the poison was child\u2019s play to her as she knew the method. However, she didn\u2019t want to use it herself.Because\u2026The reaction she mentioned earlier was really too disgusting!She definitely did not want to experience it herself.Jun Wu Xie convinced Mo Qian Yuan to drink it as he downed the contents of the whole bottle in a few gulps. Immediately after, he got up and started searching the room thoroughly.Mo Qian Yuan searched it through once and couldn\u2019t find anything suspicious. He combed through every nick and cranny.Nothing was found.The always dignified Prince was now in his own quarters sniffing and scurrying about like a rat. This made Jun Wu Xie speechless.Should she have told him that the extract of the wheat night flower could not withstand being exposed for an extended period of time and hence he would not be able to find it on all those items he just tried searching?Looking at the current Prince who was \u00a0busy searching through his clothes as he studied each single one of them intently, she decided to keep this to herself for the time being.Exercising more would also aid the detoxification process.Ah, yes, that\u2019s it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After such intense searching, he could feel the strain and the poison from the wheat night flower had already invaded his system and eroded away his health and stamina. His healthy robust body was now a thing of the past.As he sat down to get some respite, his whole forehead was covered with a thin layer of sweat.\u201cAre you sure that vile thing is really in my residence?\u201d He asked in a resigned manner.Jun Wu Xie was leisurely sipping tea when she finally placed the cup down and answered him: \u201cTo administer the poison of the wheat night flower, it has to enter the body orally.\u201dMo Qian Yuan\u2019s face turned livid as his mouth twitched. This girl! Fine, he admitted he did not ask and he just a.s.sumed it was something near him. However, why did she not tell him earlier and only told him after he had went through all that fuss?\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d Jun Wu Xie was not bothered that Mo Qian Yuan\u2019s face was black as coal.Mo Qian Yuan gritted his teeth as he reminded himself that they were in this together. He could only silently simmer as he ordered for the servants to prepare lunch to be sent into the study.\u201cIt\u2026what does it want to eat?\u201d Mo Qian Yuan looked at the black fur ball that was now curled up on her lap, swis.h.i.+ng its tail as it looked back at him. His eyes twitched.This..After the incident yesterday, this black cat had left a shadow in his heart. He still could not figure out the origin of this black cat.If it was a contractual spirit, wait\u2026 that couldn\u2019t be right, Jun Wu Xie\u2019s affinity with contractual spirit had been known throughout the country. This girl did not have any during the awakening ceremony.\u201cWanna eat?\u201d Jun Wu Xie looked at the little black cat on her lap.\u201cMeow.\u201d The little black cat blinked as it brushed its bushy tail on her arms, gently swis.h.i.+ng it up and down her arms.[Fis.h.!.+ I want to eat fis.h.!.+]\u201cFish.\u201d She replied.Mo Qian Yuan\u2019s mouth twitched slightly once again. Watching the strange conversation between this cat and girl refreshed his view on the world.Shortly after, servants came into the study and filled the desk with a huge array of food as colourful dishes filled the entire table. At the side was an eight treasure mandarin fish. Without any need for anyone to call for it, it swiftly jumped onto the table and contentedly helped himself to the delicious fish.Jun Wu Xie sat down to eat silently, on the other side Mo Quan Fei had no appet.i.te as he had no mood because he had failed to find the source of the poison. He just poured himself a cup of wine resting his chin on one hand as he watched Jun Wu Xie slowly sampling the spread before her.Although Jun Wu Xie was pet.i.te, her notoriety was so well known that people had subconsciously avoided and feared her.However the girl in front of him was just a young girl enjoying her food.If she was not born into the Lin Palace, she would have had a very calm and easy life.Jun Wu Xie was slowly tasting each dish, amount of food she actually ate was a similar amount the cat had.Mo Qian Yuan felt more and more intrigued by this female \u2018tyrant\u2019 which the whole capital had called her. Although this was only the third time he had met her, the feeling she gave him each time was different.The first time was also his birthday, he remembered clearly that year her bright smile and that pair of sparkly eyes always followed his younger brother wherever he went. She was clearly smitten by him, she ws a lovely young maiden in love.The second time was yesterday\u2019s birthday banquet, but this time her reputation had gone up a notch, but in a bad way, her name was at the tip of everyone\u2019s tongue for quite a period of time. She was seated quietly at one corner. Too quiet until her presence was almost forgotten. Despite Mo Xuan Fei and Bai Yun Xian\u2019s loving scenes. She did not waver and sat there as if she was in a different world.When he had met her again in the garden, he was surprised that this small girl actually had a strong character.The third time was today, he felt that he had found out another side of her. She had watched quietly by the side \u2013 the entire time of him making a fool of himself as he searched for the poison. This girl also had a little mischievous side to her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her eyes were downcast as she picked at the food with her chopsticks as if she was all alone in a room, not in the study of the Crown Prince\u2019s residence with the Crown Prince seated across her.After staring for a long time, seeing that she had no reaction nor had she the intention to raise her head, Mo Qian Yuan got bored as he lifted his cup up and downed it in a single swig.Once the wine entered his mouth, a sizzling spicy sensation scorched his whole throat all the way down to his stomach, before he could even understand what was happening, he felt another wave as though there was a fire within as he lurched forward and vomited.Without any warning, he had emptied his entire stomach onto the table full of food.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Jun Wu Xie finally looked up, in her hands was a small gla.s.s bowl and the other was a pair of ivory chopsticks, as she looked at the Mo Qian Yuan who was still vomiting with a calm pair of eyes.The little black cat froze. It looked at the uneaten portion of fish that was still on the table that was covered in a suspicious liquid. It also had some splashed onto its fur.\u201cI\u2026\u2026.\u201d Mo Qian Yuan knew he had messed things up and had wanted to explain himself but before he could even speak any further, he felt another burst of nausea as he quickly covered his mouth and rushed to the corner of the room and held into a wooden barrel and vomited into it.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Jun Wu Xie calmly put the bowl and chopsticks down as she got herself up and left the table of ruined delicacies.\u201cMeow!\u201d The Iittle black cat recovered from its previous stupor as it arched it\u2019s back. It jumped off the table and rubbed itself crazily against the clean soft carpet.[Master! Why are you always like that! You knew that the effects of coming into contact with the wheat night flower poison would result in vomiting, why couldn\u2019t you just warn that imbecile?!]Little black cat had tears streaming out as it frantically rubbed itself against the carpet, trying to clean it\u2019s precious black fur.\u201cI forgot.\u201d Jun Wu Xie calmly at a corner, watching Mo Qian Yuan at one corner of the room belching out as he was clutching tightly to a wooden barrel. On the other side was the black cat rolling itself frantically on the carpet. Her lips curved upwards into a small smile.From the outside of the room, the guards could hear a commotion from within. They however did not dare enter as they asked if everything was alright. Mo Qian Yuan who had been vomiting felt like crying as he roared at them to go away.His whole face was as white as sheet.Only after drink ten whole cups of water did he feel much better as the spicy burning sensation subsided. He sat weakly at the corner of the study. His whole body had lost all its energy as he sat there limply, his clothes were messy and his collar slightly open, his eyes were hanging traces of tears as he sadly looked at Jun Wu Xie.\u201cIs it the wheat night flower poison?\u201d He asked seething with anger.Jun Wu Xie nodded.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything earlier\u2026..?\u201d He lamented. Even if you beat him to death, he wouldn\u2019t believe that she did not know the reaction if he came in contact with the poison. After he saw her calm demeanour, he knew that she had expected it!\u201cThere is no difference.\u201d She sat there at one corner looking bright and fresh and most importantly, she was clean. She took out another the small porcelain bottle and opened it. A refres.h.i.+ng fragrance filled the air as she poured some onto her hands and she rubbed her hands together. The refres.h.i.+ng scent filled the room and the stench slowly disappeared.Even if she had told him in advance, he still had to vomit it all out, what difference did it make?So that\u2019s was why she did not bother telling him.Mo Qian Yuan felt that his alliance with this girl here was a double-edged sword. He might eventually die in her hands instead of his father and brother!\u201cSo, what did you eat?\u201d Jun Wu Xie faced him without the slightest bit of guilt as she asked him in a nonchalant manner.Mo Qian Yuan was taken aback for a moment before his gaze filled with murderous intent landed on the jug on the table.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had brewed this wine himself, the recipe is extremely complex, after the death of the First Emperor, there wasn\u2019t anyone else who could brew it other than my mother. After she has pa.s.sed on, there was no one left in this kingdom that can brew it, hence the only Jade Nectar left are the ones that my mother had personally brewed.\u201d They were bestowed to him after her pa.s.sing so everyday he would drink this wine in small amounts to remember his mother by.Who in this world could be so cruel\u2026to actually put poison in this precious keepsake he had left! Mo Qian Yuan clenched his fists tightly until they turned white, visible veins could be seen protruding out as his eyes had a murderous glint in them.In memory of his mother, the only thing she had left for him\u2026 they actually polluted it with such a vile thing!He would never ever in the slightest suspect that it was in this precious keepsake of his!\u201cHow much Jade Nectar are you left with?\u201d Jun Wu Xie\u2019s eyes had a slight sparkle as she asked him calmly.\u201cThere\u2019s a few barrels left.\u201d He gritted his teeth.\u201cBring me over, let me have a look.\u201d She stood up quickly as the little black cat who was still rolling on the carpet immediately stopped and followed behind.Mo Qian Yuan did not put much thought into why she wanted to go as he brought her along to the cellar. On the way over, he did not forget to put some blame on the food saying that the ingredients were not fresh and Jun\u2019s Family missy felt uncomfortable after eating it.Having the entire blame s.h.i.+fted onto her was so ridiculous that Jun Wu Xie shot him an incredulous look with a cold glint in her eye.Mo Qian Yuan could feel the murderous cold gaze coming from his back and did not dare turn around to look at the source as he quickly hurried and brought her to the wine cellar.In the cellar, there were five huge barrels, four were sealed tight as one was temporarily sealed for his daily consumption.\u201cIn the entire State of Qi, there\u2019s only these five barrels Jade Nectar left.\u201d He said with a hint of pride in them. Looking at these barrels of wines, he reminisced on the past when he was only half the height of these barrels and was sitting by the side, watching his mother brew this wine with undivided attention.Today, his mother was no longer around, he only had the wine left.Jun Wu Xie dipped her little finger into the barrel that was used for his daily consumption. She sniffed it and she could smell the extreme complex scent of a full bodied wine without any traces of the wheat night flower poison.\u201cThese wines are safe to consume, the poison is only administered before your consumption as it loses its effectiveness if left exposed for too long a period.\u201d From the beginning, Jun Wu Xie\u2019s line of sight never once left those five barrels of Jade Nectar.\u201cReally?\u201d Mo Qian Yuan\u2019s face lit up, he could still keep his mother\u2019s personally brewed wine?Jun Wun Xie nodded, a trace of loneliness was reflected in her eyes.She could feel her Little Lotus\u2019s excitement and she knew that this was the Jade Nectar she had been looking for.She had finally found the Jade Nectar!\u201cThis wine, I want some.\u201d She immediately asked him in the most direct manner.Mo Qian Yuan was surprised for a moment before he retorted: \u201cYou are a minor!

Even Mo Xuan Fei could only sit idly by and watch them drink this.However this wine held a deeper meaning to Mo Qian Yuan, it was a precious memory of his mother.Jun Wu Xie wanted to use this wine to brew medicine made Mo Qian Yuan surprised.\u201cIt can be used as medicine?\u201d The only reason why he drank a little of this wine everyday was because he missed his mother, not because he was an avid wine lover.Now, if the perpetrator knew that he had found out the source of it, they would use other means, rather than alerting them, he had to use another method.\u201cAlright, you can have some.\u201d He had made his decision.\u201cI\u2019m going to give you the wine only because I don\u2019t want to go through all that again to find out a new source.\u201d Just the thought of that tragic response, he felt suffocated once again. How his dignity was crushed in an instant when he had vomited all over the table. Thinking back also made him feel a little queasy as his face paled.Jun Wu Xie knew that this chance was hard to come by. Such a precious commodity that could kick start her cultivation was just in front of her! What heavenly spring? Who knew if she could ever find that in this lifetime?\u201cPlease prepare a small jug for me to bring back whenever I come visit you.\u201d Jun Wu Xie decided to lay low and do this discreetly, anyway the wine was here and she could get it from him every time she visited.

If they knew it was for her, they wouldn\u2019t poison it.\u201cOk, I\u2019ll have it prepared for you.\u201d He decided that he would deal with this step by step. He would let them know that this wine was a gift for her. He shuddered to think that he didn\u2019t even know that he was poisoned in his own quarters and means that he was simply living in a cage where most things were not within his control. The servants watching him are the accomplices as well.When the day comes, he shall return toot for tooth, blood for blood!He was relieved after ascertaining the source of the poison. Now he could start fighting back! He was also thankful that Jun Wu Xie had left some pills to aid him in his recovery.To completely cure him and have him back in the pink of health, time was of the essence. She had also set aside a lotus seed for him, but that had to wait till his body was in a better state, after which she would let him condition his whole body with the best of her ability. Towards people who were useful to her, she was rather generous.Mo Qian Yuan accepted the bottles she had given him, he knew deep down that she could spare no effort to save him, however she could also do the same by sparing no effort to dispose of him.After Jun Wu Xie had left him all the instructions on the various medicines, he had personally prepared a small jug of Jade Nectar and walked with her all the way up to her carriage. He stood rooted to the spot even though the carriage had long disappeared from his sight. He let out a big sigh as he stood there for quite some time.He looked up into the blue sky, he was feeling elated.Mother, I have found an incredible ally!A group of servants looked at him with a complex expression as they saw the smiling Mo Qian Yuan staring happily into the sky.To see such an expression on him, did it mean that he had really fallen head over heels for that tyrant?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Early this morning, the Crown Prince had asked permission from the Emperor to let her visit him in his residence. For half a day, they were both cooped up in the room, a lone girl and a lone guy\u2026 Before she left, the Crown Prince even personally gave her his very own prized Jade Nectar as a gift! What was even more shocking was that he had personally walked her all the way to the carriage and after she had left, he had stood at the same spot watching for a long time\u2026..and he was smiling the entire time! What did all of this imply?The news spread like wildfire within the Imperial City.His Royal Majesty has only two sons, the oldest was Crown Prince Mo Qian Yuan, the younger son was Mo Xuan Fei.The Crown Prince\u2019s reputation had far surpa.s.sed the Second Prince, however with the death of the Queen, the Crown Prince who was known for his extraordinary disposition and intelligence had suddenly changed. Not only had he became eccentric, his grace also slipped. His mannerism had turned 180 degrees. His reputation went downhill and now even people found it hard to compare the current Crown Prince and Second Prince.In terms of appearance, he definitely did not lose to Mo Xuan Fei in this aspect. However because of his capricious character, people kept him at arms length. On the other hand, Mo Xuan Fei had been actively interacting with the citizens quite frequently as he slowly garnered support.Even that night at the banquet where he had spoken up for Jun Wu Xie, others thought that what he did was uncalled for and it wrecked his image even further.Today, the Crown Prince was known to be a capricious character and being paired with the tyrannical Jun Wu Xie, people were shocked silly!This couple had not met many times, in fact they had met only twice and both were at his birthday banquets.The first banquet Jun Wu Xie had set her eyes on the Second Prince and used her family\u2019s position to get her engagement to him.At the second banquet, shortly after her engagement with the Second Prince had just dissolved, she had found another target so quickly!For a period, rumours on Jun Wu Xie\u2019s frivolous nature spread fast with many going with the version of Mo Qian Yuan \u2018picking up his Brother\u2019s old shoes\u2019.Some people scoffed at Mo Qian Yuan and said that he had eyes but was blind, some laughed at the new perfect \u2018trash couple\u2019.Either way, in a few hours, various versions were running across the grapevine as everyone on the street was talking about it.When Jun Xian saw Jun Wu Xie carrying the jug of wine, his face was pitch black.With Mo Qian Yuan\u2019s sudden invitation, it would have lead to others misunderstanding and now he actually gifted her his own precious treasure, the Jade Nectar?One had to know how much the Crown Prince treasured this Jade Nectar, even if \u00a0the Emperor wanted to drink it, unwillingness was written all over his face. There was also an incident on the previous birthday banquet when Mo Xuan Fei had drank a small cup of it, Mo Qian Yuan had rebuked him harshly for it.Since then, everyone knew that this treasured wine was only for him alone.Even his own family did not qualify to enjoy this wine, but he actually gave Jun Wu Xie some of his precious Jade Nectar, morever a whole jug of it! How could anyone explain this?Million and one questions were at the tip of Jun Xian\u2019s tongue however when he saw Jun Wu Xie\u2019s lucid eyes, he swallowed back whatever he wanted to ask.Since she had just been bullied by that b.a.s.t.a.r.d Mo Xuan Fei, wasn\u2019t it good to have someone to divert her attention away?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She would never have thought just a mere wine would make all sorts of conclusions run wild. In the eyes of others, she had already been paired together with Mo Qian Yuan.Since she finally managed to get her hands on some Jade Nectar, she couldn\u2019t wait to start and quickly went back to her room. As soon as she entered her room and closed the doors, she immediately called Little Lotus out.A small barefooted Little Lotus appeared as he quickly hobbled to the table as he stared at the bottle of wine. He was greedily looking at it with some drool dangling at the side of his mouth. His eyes were bright as he took in a deep breath.\u201cAhhhh\u2026smells nice\u2026\u201d Little Lotus looked at the wine that was poured out as he gulped several times, eyes fixated onto the beautiful sparkling liquid being poured out as his tiny hands reached out.Jun Wu Xie looked over at the eager Little Lotus with his sparkly eyes, \u201cYou can also use this to grow?\u201dLittle Lotus hesitated for a small moment before he gulped and fervently shook his head.Jun Wu Xie glared at him and he immediately retracted his small hands.After using it on herself and her family and putting aside one lotus seed for Mo Qian Yuan, Jun Wu Xie was only left with one lotus seed as she casually rolled it about in her palms as she took a shallow ceramic basin that was suitable for growing lotuses. She gently poured the Jade Nectar into it as the fragrance filled the air, even with a single whiff, it could make one gulp down involuntarily as the liquid entered the basin and gentle ripples formed.Little Lotus continued to stare intently at her actions with his mouth half opened, as drool dribbled down the side of his mouth.Little black cat was lying on the table, leaning against the lotus basin as it slowly licked its paws, intentionally exposed its sharp claws as it stared at Little Lotus with a glint in its eye.Little Lotus immediately shrank back, as he quickly wiped off the drool with one hand.According to the book, to cultivate the snow lotus, one had to pay attention to the temperature and to cultivate the snow lotus, the optimal temperature of the Jade Nectar\u2019s temperature had to be cool. Jun Wu Xie cautiously checked the temperature as she dipped her fingertip in, after which she placed the lotus seed in.As soon as the lotus seed was placed in the Jade Nectar, a fusion of lotus and wine fragrance permeated the air and soon the wondrous fragrance filled the whole room.Little Lotus\u2019s face was flushed just from the smell as his eyes sparkled more.Jun Wu Xie stared at the lotus seed in the wine for a long time but found that it did not have any further reaction, except for the fragrance that was getting richer by each moment. Despite her sensitive sense of smell, she found that this fragrance did not make her feel uncomfortable but rather it was very invigorating and refres.h.i.+ng. She felt as if she was being cleansed thoroughly and felt as though she was soaking in a hot spring as all her tension and stress melted away.This also washed away all the apprehension she had held for this cultivation method as she felt her heart felt peaceful and calm.Although she did not know what spiritual energy was, under this fragrance, she could clearly feel a warm wave of air flowing into her meridians.Could this be the spiritual energy of this world?Jun Wu Xie\u2019s eyes sparkled as she sat by the table, enjoying this moment as she breathed calmly.Although the materials were hard to find, the effects were way too effective!However, she did not know if this jug of Jade Nectar was sufficient to develop this seed. Mo Qian Yuan had only a few more barrels left, if it was consumed too quickly, she really did not know where else could she find a new supply.The probability to find more in the State of Qi was close to zero.The first time absorbing spiritual energy was an indescribable feeling, somewhat warm yet as if there was something soft embracing her at the same time as it slowly fused together with her body. She gently closed her eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This familiar scent was from the lotus fragrance which Jun Wu Xie had on her.It was a very nice intoxicating smell.She lifted her head and glanced at him in an indifferent manner, it seems she was getting accustomed to his displays of affection, although some part of her was unwilling but it did not really affect her in anyway hence she was not too concerned about it. She did not want to spend too much effort arguing with him so she did not even bother to bring it up.He moved to her side and scooped her up as he sat down, placing her on his lap as he continued embracing her from the back. \u201cSo\u2026That Mo Qian Yuan guy gave you this?\u201d Although he was smiling, it failed to reach his eyes as a cold murderous glint could be seen as he looked at the wine with displeasure.Not waiting for her answer, he picked up the jar of wine as he raised his eyebrows as he gave her a glance and brought the jar closer.\u201cThis wine is unworthy of your mouth.\u201d After saying that, he flicked his wrist and attempting to pour all the wine away.Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes as she glared at him coldly wanting to block him, however his grip on her was very strong as he held onto her firmly as he hugged her tightly with one arm, rendering her helpless.\u201cGive it to me. Put it back!\u201d She seethed.Jun Wu Yao looked at her with a lascivious grin, not a trace of anger could be seen.\u201cWu Xie\u2026Don\u2019t be angry, if you like wine, I can help you find some good wine, how can you drink such garbage?\u201d\u201cPut it back.\u201d She glared at him menacingly.Jun Wu Yao continued smiling at her without moving as his deep black eyes flashed a faint hint of purple.\u201cLe\u2026Let\u2026Let my Master go\u2026\u201d a tearful voice came from the side.At the corner of the wall stood Little Lotus with his eyes looking at the situation with a confused expression and a slightly flushed face, his little body leaning on the wall as his legs were wobbling a little.\u201cThis is\u2026?\u201d Jun Wu Yao raised his eyebrows with interest.Jun Wu Xie was gloomy, Little Lotus was still in his physical form, with Jun Wu Yao\u2019s sudden appearance, Little Lotus still stayed around!For Jun Wu Yao, finding out Little Lotus\u2019s ident.i.ty would be child\u2019s play.\u201cOh? I thought that black cat was your contractual spirit, well looking at things, guess I got it wrong.\u201d He lowered his head as looked at Jun Wu Xie, his lips curled upwards.\u201cYo..You! If you don\u2019t let go of my Master, don\u2019t blame me for being impolite to you!\u201d Little Lotus puffed up his little flushed cheeks, looking absolutely adorable.The little black cat that was sitting quietly on the table lifted its paw to cover its eyes.It wasn\u2019t that it was too weak but rather its enemy was way too strong.That little fool was good as dead!\u201cOh?\u201d Jun Wu Yao looked at that little boy coldly as he slightly lifted his finger and a flash of black light hit Little Lotus on his forehead.\u201cOuch!\u201d Feeling a sharp pain from his forehead, Little Lotus fell to the ground as he curled up in pain.\u201cI\u2019m speaking with Wu Xie, when was it your place to interrupt us?\u201d Jun Wu Yao laughed lightly as if nothing happened and as he turned around to face Jun Wu Xie. He was stunned as his lips curled up.A pair of eye filled with cold murderous intent was staring back at him, she was still restrained by him in his embrace but in one hand she had several needles that were at his throat.\u201cI\u2019ve got no mood to play around with your nonsense! Stop bothering me.\u201d She glared at him icily. She usually did not bother what he did however if he disturbs her, she would not be polite with him at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This girl was too interesting, she exposed her fangs just like that!Jun Wu Xie placed those needles at several points. Although she wouldn\u2019t kill him, she also wouldn\u2019t let him off so easily!Jun Wu Yao lowered his body and leaned into the needles as they pierced through his skin and into his throat as bright red blood flowed out, dying her hands red. Despite this all, her eyes had not a single trace of panic in them.\u201cIt was my fault, I should not have disturbed you, how do you want to punish me? I\u2019ll leave it all up to you.\u201d Although all four needles had pierced his throat and crimson blood was flowing out, he still gave her a meek smile with a pleading expression.\u201cPut it back.\u201d She retorted coldly.Jun Wu Yao sighed as he placed the jug of wine back on the table.\u201cWu Xie, I was wrong, if you like, you can keep this garbage temporarily to play with, but remember you cannot drink it, the alcohol content is very strong and it will hurt your throat, I\u2019ll find a good one and bring it for you tomorrow.\u201d He softly said as he tried to cajole the angry her, completely disregarding the wound on the throat.\u201cI don\u2019t want anything.\u201d She snuffed.Jun Wu Yao did not force it any further as he saw that she was still upset. He raised his hand and hooked his finger as the black object that hit Little Lotus\u2019s forehead flew back to his hands.\u201cI was only joking, I didn\u2019t really mean to hurt him. He\u2019s your contractual spirit, how can I bear to kill him?\u201d He tried to appease her as he gave her a charming smile.Little Lotus slowly stood up groggily, that flick to the forehead was so painful he felt as if his soul would shatter anytime! This was the first time he had experienced such pain, generally injuries inflicted by humans only exhausted their spiritual energy, they can\u2019t feel any pain from attacks by humans however this time the pain was so intense!He looked at Jun Wu Yao with a lingering fear, this mysterious man was too terrible!\u201cYou, come here.\u201d Jun Wu Yao hooked his fingers and beckoned Little Lotus over.Little Lotus was shocked as he stood there petrified.\u201cI only teased you for a bit, no need to be so afraid, here, this is for you, take it as compensation.\u201d Jun Wu Yao tossed a dark green orb over as the quivering Little Lotus caught it.Jun Wu Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie gently.\u201cNow, are you still angry?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re annoying.\u201d Jun Wu Xie glared back.\u201cYour words are so hurtful.\u201d Jun Wu Yao responded in a distressed tone with a slight frown.\u201cIf you like to get hurt, I have here one hundred and eight needles.\u201d She looked at him icily.Jun Wu Yao chuckled as he pulled her hands to his lips and kissed it. \u201cIf it makes you happy, even if its ten times of that, I\u2019m willing.\u201dJun Wu Xie frowned at his comments, she had seen her fair share of desperate people however one that was such a m.a.s.o.c.h.i.s.t was her first time.\u201cI\u2019ll be happy as long as you do not bother me.\u201d She retorted. If he dared to touch her contractual spirit and her Jade Nectar ever again, she would be more than willing to use those hundred and eight needles!\u201cI won\u2019t bother you but I cannot bear to leave your side.\u201d He said with a weak smile.She glared at him and didn\u2019t say anything further as she stood up.This time, he did not dare to restrain her as he released her.\u201cYou reek of blood. You can go now.\u201d Jun Wu Xie frowned at his blood stained hands as well as the strong stench of fresh blood that now filled the room. With the fresh blood mixed in with the wine and lotus fragrance, it made her very uncomfortable. She needed to wash up and get rid of this horrid smell a.s.saulting her nose now!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This counts as being hurt?\u201d He looked at the four needles on his blood stained hands. His eyes no longer had any hint of black in them as a deep purple colour surfaced.But this was the girl\u2019s small \u2018teethmarks\u2019, so he didn\u2019t really mind it.\u201cHave you found the person I\u2019ve asked for?\u201d Jun Wu Yao asked coldly.\u201cEverything has been prepared.\u201d\u201cAh, that group of old geezers , \u00a0want to trap me in there? They really know how to dream. I will make sure to repay them properly for that day.\u201d His lips curled upwards as he looked at the needles in his hand. There was a glint in his eyes.He had never experienced any rejection from her Nor had she put up a fight before, however today he had finally seen a different expression on her usually cold and expressionless face. That look in her eyes was priceless, more precious any gems in this world.He really wanted those eyes\u2026However, if they left her, they would lose its beauty. Those eyes were really meant for her, they suited her perfectly and only she could draw out its beauty.\u201cHow can those fools deserve to be your rivals?\u201d The shadow whispered, his voice was full of admiration and wors.h.i.+p.\u201cLet them gloat and enjoy for a while longer, when I crush them, It\u2019ll be more interesting that way.\u201d The higher they climb, the harder they fall\u2026Jun Wu Yao narrowed his cold eyes.\u201cYes!\u201d The shadow answered fervently.\u201cThis time, I\u2019ll stay here, If you have any message just send it here directly.\u201d Jun Wu Yao ordered.\u201cThis subordinate obeys!\u201d\u201cOh yes, one more thing.\u201d Jun Wu Yao suddenly thought of something.Tomorrow go over to Jade Moon and request for a jar of wine.The shadow was surprised for a moment, although he did not know why his lord had requested for the wine, he quickly answered \u201cYes!\u201d\u201cJade Nectar\u2026was it?\u201d Jun Wu Yao narrowed his eyes as his murderous intent filled his surrounding. He did not mind going into the Palace to make that meddling Crown Prince disappear for good.The shadow was just kneeling quietly at the side, he did not dare to reflect the meaning behind those words, he knew he only needed to do what he was told.After making a few more arrangements, Jun Wu Yao no longer stayed around. The shadow faded into darkness and completely disappeared.In Jun Wu Xie\u2019s room, she was frowning as she washed and scrubbed her hands over and over again \u2013 only after ascertaining that there was no longer any trace of blood scent on them did she walk over to the table.Little Lotus stood there in silence as he stared at the dark green orb. Fiddling it between his fingers as he held it towards the moon and looked at it.\u201cDoes it still hurt?\u201d Jun Wu Xie asked Little Lotus monotonously.Little Lotus was slightly surprised for a moment as he raised his head and rubbed his little forehead, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt anymore.\u201d His rosy face wore a sweet smile. Earlier when Jun Wu Yao had retracted back the black object, all the pain instantly disappeared, without feeling the slightest discomfort, Little Lotus began to doubt himself if he had really just been hurt by a human.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After carefully examining it and when she could not find a trace of any injury did she finally relax as her eyes turned gentle.\u201cIn the future, do not do anything, just let him be.\u201d Jun Wu Xie felt that Jun Wu Yao was not as gentle as he appeared on the surface. No matter if it was that incident with Mo Xuan Fei or the few times that he carried the scent of blood, those were all warning signs.Jun Wu Yao was strong, much stronger than anyone she has ever met. He was powerful yet mysterious at the same time and he exuded a dangerous aura. She really did not want him to be her opponent now when she was still weak and powerless. As long as he did not provoke her, she will not bother what he does. However if he crossed the line, she would let him know that she was not to be trifled with!\u201cBut\u2026.\u201d Little Lotus choked out. Based on his intuition, he could feel that man was extremely dangerous and when he saw that he was very close to his Master, he could not help but felt chills run down his back.Although that man was smiling on the surface, it gave him a chill that was bone deep.\u201cHe will not hurt me.\u201d If he had attempted anything dangerous on her, she would have acted already.She just couldn\u2019t understand why he had stuck around. He was indeed in a league of his own, even if he was not here in Lin Palace, in this world she didn\u2019t think anyone had much ability to cause him any major harm. Moreover he had repeatedly used the excuse of repaying his grat.i.tude to her. She found it such a joke.Little black cat was lying on the table silently, swis.h.i.+ng his long tail as it looked at Jun Wu Xie.Jun Wu Xie didn\u2019t have much of a temperament. As long as you didn\u2019t disturb, bother or provoke her and left her alone, she was generally docile and aloof. However if you messed with her, results were unthinkable.That night, that huge fire in the mountains that devoured everything, who would have thought that the culprit would be such a seemingly harmless and quiet girl? She had burned down everything in that villa, including her only family as well as her nightmare.Jun Wu Xie was just like that, she was generally amiable and doesn\u2019t care much about what other\u2019s think. However if someone had provoked her, she would put no stop to it until the other party had no way out.Little black cat was never afraid that she would suffer, because even if she is disadvantaged, she would absolutely not be at the losing end. The opposing party would definitely be in a much worse condition than her.\u201cMaster, this bead\u2026can I use it?\u201d Although Little Lotus never knew what was his master thinking of, he could still vaguely sense that she cared about him.This was the first time that she had shown him concern\u2026Such a nice feeling\u2026so warm and fuzzy\u2026\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jun Wu Xie couldn\u2019t help but ask as she looked at the dark green bead in his hands.\u201cEmbellished Wooden Bead! This can aid contractual spirits in their cultivation! This is the second time I\u2019ve seen it. I had seen it once in the Spirit World, didn\u2019t think that I could actually find one here as well.\u201d Little Lotus chattered on excitedly, with the appearance of this Embellished Wood Bead, compared to the miserable state he was in prior to this, he seemed to have completely forgotten about it.One had to know that this simple looking bead was actually a highly sought after treasure that was very precious to aid contractual spirits in their cultivation.\u201cYou can also cultivate?\u201d Jun Wu Xie raised her eyebrows in surprise, she had initially thought that the only way to strengthen contractual spirits was through the person\u2019s cultivation. It seems there was more to it If the contractual spirit could cultivate on their own, wouldn\u2019t that save a lot of time and effort?She had to give some credit to Jun Wu Yao, at least he compensated something worthy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Only upon the awakening ceremony, will they be truly able to appear in this world.In the spirit world, the contractual spirit can continue to cultivate their growth there however in this world, they can only rely on the human\u2019s cultivation to grow in their cultivation.When the contractual spirits cross over to this world, their cultivation would be extremely slow.The Embellished Wood Bead was something that did not harness any power within, however it had a special ability, that was its ability to purify.In this world where humans live, the environment was polluted hence the contractual spirits were not able to cultivate on their own, only relying on their human counterpart, would they be able to cultivate. The energy they try to absorb from the environment would be mixed with impurities that were hard to be extracted, making it a daunting task.However things were different if the Embellished Wood Bead was used! It could especially extract all the pure energy from the polluted surroundings, and this in turn could be easily absorbed by the contractual spirit and directly used for its cultivation.\u201cPurification.\u201d Jun Wu Xie muttered out as she pondered for awhile, looking at that plain looking bead. It didn\u2019t look like much but it\u2019s use was really essential.Little Lotus\u2019s \u2018medicinal\u2019 value was already very beneficial, if he cultivated more, how would he grow and develop? What would happen? However his endurance and physical strength really required a much needed boost.\u201cIt is a treasure!\u201d Little Lotus grinned from ear to ear as he carefully held the bead in his hand.Although he had experienced such an intense pain just now, it was all well worth it. If he could exchange for a few more treasures, he really didn\u2019t mind more pain in exchange.\u201cJust keep it safe, I\u2019ll leave it to you how you want to cultivate yourself.\u201d Jun Wu Xie nodded. This Jun Wu Yao was indeed a mysterious person, his approach was very vicious however he could easily toss a treasure like this out so readily, it lead her to wonder what was his origin\u2026Although she had no prior knowledge to this Spirit World until Little Lotus explained things to her, for Jun Wu Yao to even possess something of this caliber and throwing it so casually to Little Lotus\u2026 she really was quite speechless.If such a person was an enemy, things will be difficult\u2026If friends\u2026Jun Wu Xie thought of the word friend and Jun Wu Yao. She furrowed at that thought.This word \u2018friend\u2019 only made her think of one person and that person was from her previous world. An image of that person popped up in her mind.\u201cThat idiot.\u201d Jun Wu Xie\u2019s clenched fist trembled. She was originally working as veterinarian in A city, however she was discovered by a mysterious organization. She ended up joining that mysterious organization, saving people\u2019s lives with her veterinarian license.She vividly remember that day when they were suddenly attacked by a group of people and that idiot had jumped in front of her so suddenly and s.h.i.+elded her from the oncoming a.s.sault.\u201cYour hands and legs are so small, what\u2019s the use of staying here? Quickly, leave\u2026do not linger\u2026\u201d After which that person had on a smile but she was already\u2026Jun Wu Xie rubbed her brows, she didn\u2019t remember much from her previous world as she had always been a loner, even towards her only family she could bear to be so ruthless. She never had much interactions with others and never placed much importance towards life and death, Only when that person had protected her in exchange for her own life, this was something she could never forget.The reason she hated the smell of blood was precisely due to that day \u2013 that person\u2019s chest was marked by the death G.o.d as a crimson red flower bloomed on her chest as the smell of fresh blood overwhelmed her.\u201cIt\u2019s not worth to save someone like me\u2026\u201d Jun Wu Xie muttered, as she looked down and bit her lower lip. If that person had not jumped out to protect her, perhaps that person might still be in that world saving other lives now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Amidst the beautiful pink lotuses in the pond was now a pristine white lotus.That\u2019s why plant type contractual spirits are very easy to nurture! Just plant them anywhere suitable and you\u2019re done!Little Lotus needed time to cultivate on his own and could not be by Jun Wu Xie\u2019s side every moment now. Jun Wu Xie however did not really care about this point as she patiently took good care of the lotus seed in the lotus basin in her room.Just within a night, the lotus basin that was full of the Jade Nectar had gone down by half, as the lotus seed that was in there showed signs of germination.This speed was simply too fast!Although Jun Wu Xie had acc.u.mulated a little spirit energy, the rate of consumption of the Jade Nectar couldn\u2019t keep up. If this continues on, it would take only two more days before the whole jar of Jade Nectar runs out and she will have to go back to the Palace for more.A knock sounded and Jun Wu Xie turned towards the door and said: \u201cCome in.\u201dShe waited for quite sometime and yet no one came in. Seeing that, she walked to the door and opened it, there was not a person in sight but a beautiful jar was on the floor by the door.Jun Wu Xie opened the cover of the \u00a0jar and a strong intoxicating burst of \u00a0fragrance filled the room, masking even the scent of the Jade Nectar.The fragrance from this jar was much stronger than the Jade Nectar.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Jun Wu Xie did not have to even bother thinking to know who was it from.Holding the jar as she left the room, a faint chuckle sounded as Jun Wu Yao smiled, looking at Jun Wu Xie\u2019s back disappearing around the corner.In the study, Jun Qing was scribbling something and Long Qi stood by his side silently.As Jun Wu Xie entered the study, Jun Qing\u2019s face lit up.\u201cWu Xie.\u201d\u201cUncle, this jar of wine is for you.\u201d She put the jar of wine on the table.\u201cJade Nectar?\u201d Jun Qing smiled, his darling niece whom received a jar of Jade Nectar from Mo Qian Yuan had Long reached his ears.\u201cThis isn\u2019t it.\u201d\u201cAm I able to drink wine now? Can my body take it?\u201d Jun Qing did not want to probe any further with regards to the wine.\u201cA few small cups is fine, this wine\u2019s quality is not bad.\u201d Jun Wu Xie never had any interest towards wines, the Jade Nectar was specially reserved for gardening.This wine was good but it could not aid her in her \u2018gardening\u2019 so it was useless to her.\u201cThat\u2019s nice of you, thanks.\u201d Jun Qing grinned.Jun Wu Xie nodded back and left the study. Long Qi bowed down respectfully as he watched her leave.A tall figure was outside the room watching all that happened in the study through the window. He had also caught the act of her gifting his wine away. His handsome smile was overflowing, if he saw her pouring the wine into the lotus basin, he would have been really upset.That girl did not drink the wine but used it to nurture the lotus seed, how interesting.If it was used to grow flowers then it didn\u2019t matter anymore.For the Jade Moon which was a better wine than the Jade Nectar, with regards to her gifting it away, someone wasn\u2019t that upset about it as the words \u201cthis wine\u2019s quality is not bad\u201d left a good impression.Rather than using it to rear flowers, gifting it to someone else means that it\u2019s grade was significantly higher was it not?Two days later, Jun Wu Xie once again went to the Palace to visit the Crown Prince and returned home with another jar of Jade Nectar.Crown Prince\u2019s precious Jade Nectar, which even money could not buy, was always given to Jun Wu Xie whenever she visited. Whenever she left the Crown Prince\u2019s residence, she always brought a jar of Jade Nectar home.When this trend was affirmed, everyone around had already linked the two up as a couple.As people talked more and various versions kept going around, more and more found this funny. The incident which Mo Qian Yuan had snided Mo Xuan Fei during his birthday banquet was still fresh in Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s mind as he kept brooding over it.One of the days when Jun Wu Xie was visiting Mo Qian Yuan, Mo Xuan Fei evidently brought Bai Yun Xian over to the Crown Prince\u2019s residence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The past few days of treatment had removed most of the toxins in his body and Mo Qian Yuan was feeling much better. His usually pale face now had more colour.When the Second Prince visit was announced, his face showed a hint of impatience.\u201cChoosing this time to come, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s up to no good.\u201d Mo Qian Yuan sneered.The relations.h.i.+p between the two brothers were not harmonious. Mo Qian Yuan\u2019s mother was the Queen while Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s mother was a concubine. After the Queen had pa.s.sed away, she took over the harem and also became Emperor\u2019s favourite. The Emperor had doted heavily on this concubine although the Queen had pa.s.sed away and this made Mo Qian Yuan\u2019s heart chill.Jun Wu Xie pulled her hand that was taking his pulse back as she said: \u201cNow that your recovery is known, some people are afraid and cannot keep still.\u201dMo Qian Yuan did not conceal his recovery and this was also specified specifically by Jun Wu Xie.Who would support a stupid Prince and Lin Palace? He must first re-establish the reputation from the ground up, starting by gaining back the trust from the citizens and the other ministers.This point was understood well by both Jun Wu Xie and Mo Xian Yuan.\u201cI\u2019d like to see what he can do to me, the Crown Prince.\u201d Mo Qian Yuan scoffed as his eyes flashed a hint of cold intent. Although the Crown Prince\u2019s position was not stable, the Emperor still needed to ensure his own reputation. Hence he would not do anything radical and even Mo Qian Yuan wouldn\u2019t dare do anything in front of others.In a few moments, Mo Xuan Fei and Bai Yun Xian strode in leisurely.In terms of appearance and temperament, Mo Xuan Fei had a high reputation in the whole country, Bai Yun Xian was dressed in white like a fairy, being by his side had complemented this couple as an air of elegance and pride could be felt.\u201cImperial Brother, I\u2019ve not seen you for so many days, your complexion looks much better.\u201d Mo Xuan Fei spewed his words out smoothly as he entered and caught a glimpse of Jun Wu Xie which startled him slightly.Mo Xuan Fei felt a discomfort in his chest, as unhappiness filled it. The number one reason which her looks were never emphasized in the past was because of her terrible temper that had surpa.s.sed and overshadowed her appearance.She had always looked at him with eyes full of admiration and enthusiasm however now her eyes were cold and aloof and what\u2019s more, she didn\u2019t even look his way.This change in temperament gave a feeling as if she was a totally different person, her ethereal beauty matched her ice cold personality as if she was a snow lotus \u2013 pristine,beautiful and unattainable.Jun Wu Xie also was dressed in white today as she was seated casually on a chair with her bright eyes slightly downcast reading the book in her hands, with no intention to raise her head.Both were dressed in white, both had cold personalities, both were gorgeous women, but somehow, Mo Xuan Fei actually felt that after seeing Jun Wu Xie, Bai Yun Xian seemed less elegant and stunning.Jun Wu Xie\u2019s indifference that she exuded was as if the mundane world had nothing to do with her as she sat there quietly, everything about it was so natural, even her sitting her posture was perfect. In contrast, Bai Yun Xian didn\u2019t look that natural although her chin was raised up in an aloof manner, if directly compared with Jun Wu Xie, hers was simply intentional and made it seem less apealing.Mo Xuan Fei felt that he must be crazy to actually feel more moved when he looked at Jun Wu Xie.Impossible! This must be an illusion!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This can nourish the body, hope Imperial Brother can enjoy its benefits.\u201dMo Xuan Fei politely replied with Bai Yun Xian sitting by his side, she placed the bottle of pills on the table.Mo Xuan Fei said it articulately, but this \u2018concern\u2019 came a little late didn\u2019t it?Jun Wu Xie eyes were downcast all these while, she had not the slightest interest to waste her time with such a small character.If it was in the past, perhaps Mo Qing Yuan might have felt a little moved to be able to get his hands on pills personally refined by Bai Yun Xian. However, with Jun Wu Xie personally overseeing his body\u2019s conditioning, he could feel that his whole physique had been significantly improved in such a short time. The effectiveness was simply too astonis.h.i.+ng! So now, if it was Bai Yun Xian\u2019s pills, or even her Master\u2019s personally refined pills, Mo Qian Yuan would not even waste his effort of giving a weak smile.In Mo Qing Yuan\u2019s heart, Jun Wu Xie was simply a saint! An unparalleled genius doctor!\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to thank you.\u201d Mo Qing Yuan however had not made any movement, as he just sat there with no intention of reaching out for the bottle.Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s face did not look good as he subconsciously looked to Bai Yun Xian, sure enough, his lack of interest in the pills had made Bai Yun Xian unhappy.\u201cDoes his Highness despise this Jade Dew pill which I\u2019ve refined?\u201d Bai Yun Xian suddenly spoke coldly, although the ident.i.ty of the other party was the Crown Prince, she did not have the slightest humility in her tone.She is Qing Yun Clan Sovereign\u2019s disciple. No matter where she went, people had always highly respected her and she had never given away anything so easily, usually it was others begging from her. \u00a0However once she was in State of Qi\u2019s Imperial City, again and again, she had been rebuffed a total of three times! The first time was at Lin Palace where she was rejected by Jun Wu Xie who had outright refused her offer to help. Second time was when they encountered in Ghost City, an ignorant old man showed disdain over her Master\u2019s personally refined elixir and chose a nameless young boy\u2019s medicine over hers! This. .h.i.t of a series of two times was as if a nail had struck her twice. This had also led to Bai Yun Xian\u2019s haughty self-esteem to be very dissatisfied, and now even the Crown Prince was behaving so perfunctory, as if he completely despised her Jade Dew pill.This was simply intolerable to Bai Yun Xian, she had high qualifications in medicine, otherwise she would not be received as a disciple of the Sovereign, whether if it was in Qing Yun Clan or elsewhere, everyone had always fawned over her and highly regarded whatever she said.Now, Jun Wu Xie and Mo Qian Yuan had both hit her sore spot with nails, it made her proud heart feel as though its been stabbed twice.\u201cMiss Bai, why do you say so? My body presently has no serious issues, I simply do not want to waste this treasure for nothing.\u201d Although Mo Qing Yuan mouth was saying so, but his face had not the slightest expression of sincerity.Bai Yun Xian gritted her teeth, she was not stupid, how could she not see that Mo Qing Yuan was simply stating a perfunctory remark?Seeing Bai Yun Xian\u2019s face getting blacker by the minute, Mo Xuan Fei immediately changed the subject, \u201cImperial Brother\u2019s mood has been very good the past few days, but it\u2019s my duty as your younger brother to remind you that too close contact with someone is not a good thing. All that glitters is not gold, Imperial Brother must not be confused.\u201d When he said that, his gaze naturally fell on Jun Wu Xie.From the time he has stepped in till now, Jun Wu Xie did not even given him a glance, which made Mo Xuan Fei express his displeasure.He did not want Jun Wu Xie was one thing, he could not tolerate that haughty att.i.tude she was adopting towards him. That was another matter altogether.This was something the wretched human heart was like, when Jun Wu Xie\u2019s affection towards him was as deep as the sea, she was completely smitten with him to the point of obsession, he even felt disgusted at one point.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Who knew, she acted as though nothing had happened and even worse she treated him as if he was air. What\u2019s more, she further entangled herself with the Crown Prince!This was completely different from what he had thought!When he had abandoned Jun Wu Xie, she should have been very heartbroken, how could she be so calm?Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s words made Mo Qian Yuan\u2019s eyes flash a cold murderous intent.\u201cWhoever I choose to interact with, younger brother do not need to worry about it.\u201dMo Xuan Fei eyes was staring at Jun Wu Xie the whole time, seeing that she had no response, his heart got more irritated as he brazenly retorted, \u201cImperial Brother has misunderstood, I was worried for Imperial Brother, as a prince, the Crown Prince of our State of Qi, whoever Imperial Brother chooses as a bride must also be able to be a mother to our Nation. Some people may be beautiful, but in reality are not very bright, Imperial Brother does not know her very well yet, I was really worried Imperial Brother would be fooled.\u201dMo Qian Yuan was very unhappy, since when did Mo Xuan Fei had the right to come over to the Crown Prince residence and start finding fault at everything? \u00a0Just as he was about to rebuke Mo Xuan Fei, he discovered that Jun Wu Xie who had kept her head down all these while had suddenly looked up.A pair of cold eyes with a hint of smile, as if full of mockery looked towards Mo Xuan Fei.\u201cIs making a fool of oneself very fun?\u201d Jun Wu Xie suddenly spoke up, as she casually glanced at Mo Xuan Fei and Bai Yun Xian.\u201cWhat did you say!\u201d Mo Xuan Fei stared incredulously at Jun Wu Xie.Jun Wu Xie glanced that Jade Dew pill.\u201cMeow\u201dSuddenly a black cat jumped on the table, it\u2019s bushy tail inadvertently swept the bottle of pills off.As the bottle fell, a shattering sound could be heard as a few white pills rolled onto the carpet.\u201cJun Wu Xie! Look at what you have done!\u201d Mo Xuan Fei bellowed angrily as he stared fiercely at Jun Wu Zie, Bai Yun Xian\u2019s pills had been ruined!Jun Wu Xie did not even cast a glance to him, just stared at the little black cat as in jumped onto the carpet. It went over to the exposed white Jade Dew pills and sniffed, but the next second, Jun Wu Xie pulled it back into her embrace.\u201cDo not eat, it\u2019s dirty.\u201dJun Wu Xie\u2019s comment instantly made Bai Yun Xian and Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s complexion turn green.She actually said that Bai Yun Xian\u2019s refined pills were dirty!Bai Yun Xian\u2019s face was completely black, she knew who Jun Wu Xie was and also knew the relations.h.i.+p between Mo Xuan Fei and Jun Wu Xie had before. This woman had previously stuck onto Mo Xuan Fei like glue, how dare she say such a thing?Mo Xuan Fei was about to say something but Bai Yun Xian raised her hand, stopping him.\u201cMiss Jun.\u201d Bai Yun Xian slowly spoke, her cold voice had a trace of pride and displeasure.Jun Wu Xie ignored her as she continued fussing over the little black cat and even started brus.h.i.+ng it\u2019s fur.\u201cAlthough this Jade Dew pill is not a top tier medicine, but also very rare, and now that you\u2019ve ruined the Crown Prince\u2019s pills, don\u2019t you feel that you are too rude?\u201d Bai Yun Xian looked at Jun Wu Xie as though she was an eyesore, Jun Wu Xie was a Missy of Lin Palace, so what? Before her, compared to Qing Yun Clan, Jun Wu Xie was simply nothing!In front of her, Qing Yun Clan Sovereign\u2019s disciple, let\u2019s see what kind of reply can she give, Bai Yun Xian sneered inwardly.Jun Wu Xie looked at Bai Yun Xian in a condescending manner, \u201cRare?\u201d She raised an eyebrow slightly, seemingly focusing on Bai Yun Xian\u2019s Jade Dew pill as she felt a little ridiculous.What was this att.i.tude?! Bai Yun Xian frowned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That was all in the past, now she treats him like air, this new contrast made Mo Xuan Fei feel irritable.\u201cDream of obtaining it but not unable to have it?\u201d Jun Wu Xie just made light of what Mo Xuan Fei had said, as her clear eyes were looking at the pair of adulterers hopping about.That remark sounded very familiar, when they were in Ghost City, didn\u2019t the crowd also use a similar phase, \u201cmany wanted but could not get their hands on\u201d with the Qing Yun pill?In the end, it was still rejected by other people, well, it was that old man who knew his stuff.\u201cMeow.\u201d Little black cat nestled comfortably in Jun Wu Xie arms as it looked at the pair of adulterers with disdain.[Really a disgrace, parading out here like fools when they treat such level of pills as rare pills. My Master makes much better quality pills and much better than that master of yours. So what are you even being so proud of? She can easily outdo your master not to mention you.] Little black cat scoffed as it raised it\u2019s little nose in the air full of pride.Bai Yun Xian had never been mocked by anyone so directly in her entire life and the other party was just a young missy who did not even have the right to hold her shoes?\u201cThis is Miss Jun despises my pill? But this pill was not given to you, you have damaged the Crown Prince\u2019s medicine, I\u2019m afraid it is not appropriate.\u201d Bai Yun Xian proudly glanced over at Mo Qian Yuan, Lin Palace in the country is certainly powerful, but if compared to Qing Yun Clan, they were like ants, if Mo Qing Yuan was not a fool, naturally he would know what to say.If Jun Wu Xie were to offend Qing Yun Clan Sovereign\u2019s disciple, this was not a wise choice.Bai Yun Xian looked over at the couple as she started from Mo Qing Yuan and her gaze eventually rested on Jun Wu Xie.Bai Yun Xian was right, whoever who had brains knew who to choose out of the two, Mo Xuan Fei was a cla.s.sic example and he chose Bai Yun Xian.But\u2026\u2026Mo Qian Yuan sneered, \u201cMy things are Wu Xie\u2019s things, what she wants to do with it, I do not mind.\u201d Then he looked at Jun Wu Xie warmly, full of affection in a doting manner.So what if it\u2019s Qing Yun Clan?Bai Yun Xian and Mo Xuan Fei are close, this was a well known fact, even if this time he had chosen to support Bai Yun Xian, what could he have gained?Mo Qing Yuan was not a fool, he knew Jun Wu Xie was his real ally.Bai Yun Xian\u2019s face appeared a hint of surprise, Mo Qing Yuan was obviously standing on Jun Wu Xie\u2019s side.Mo Xuan Fei secretly gnashed his teeth, he did not know how Jun Wu Xie and Mo Qing Yuan had hooked up together, they have only met each other a few times? If say love at first sight, it should have been at the instance they had first met. But when Jun Wu Xie and Mo Qian Yuan met was at Mo Qian Yuan\u2019s birthday banquet and at that time she had clearly fancied Mo Xuan Fei, not the Crown Prince! This did not happen too long ago and now they are on such close terms?First Jade Nectar wine was generously being given to Jun Wu Xie, and now he is directly opposing Bai Yun Xian to protect Jun Wu Xie.Mo Qian Yuan\u2019s brain is not working? To protect Jun Wu Xie, he was not even afraid of offending Qing Yun Clan ?\u201cIt\u2019s only some medicinal pills.\u201d Jun Wu Xie retorted defiantly, she felt that Bai Yun Xian was very funny, she was making a mountain out of a molehill and kicking up such a fuss.\u201cIt\u2019s only some medicinal pills? The way you\u2019ve put it sounds really easy, do you know how much time and effort Yun Xian had spent making those pills? You spoil your cat and pamper it without even doing anything to it. It was your cat that knocked them off the table and yet you don\u2019t want to account for anything. Imperial Brother has already protected you and said not to pursue the matter any further, I naturally did not say anything, but since when could you make such irresponsible remarks? \u201d Mo Xuan Fei laughed coldly. Mo Qian Yuan looked at Jun Wu Xie\u2019s indifferent expression face and found her dazzling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

To have an untamed beast doing such nonsensical stuff in her presence, it\u2019s a bane! Today, you have to kill it to offer your apology to Qing Yun Clan to prevent any such things from happening ever again!\u201d Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s had a glint as he flashed a sinister smile. He could not touch Jun Wu Xie right here in the Crown Prince\u2019s residence, however to push the blame onto the cat and have it killed, that wasn\u2019t very difficult.He could tell that this little black cat was very precious to her and right now, what he wanted to do most was to tear that calm and indifferent expression off her face.Mo Qian Yuan could protect Jun Wu Xie but not the black cat. If he chose to protect both of them, that would be slapping Qing Yun Clan in the face.This was but a small matter but blowing it up had its advantages. Mo Xuan Fei wanted to pressure Mo Qian Yuan by using Qing Yun Clan\u2019s name.Mo Qian Yuan narrowed his eyes as a glint of anger could be seen.Jun Wu Xie was holding onto the little black cat as she looked casually at Mo Xuan Fei running his mouth off.The little black cat\u2019s eyes narrowed as the surroundings had a subtle change in atmosphere. It\u2019s shadow started showing signs that it was going to transform, Jun Wu Xie who had sensed the change in the atmosphere quickly pressed her hand down firmly on the little black cat\u2019s neck as she tried to calm it down to prevent it from being further agitated.\u201cIt\u2019s only some play thing, if you all care so much about it, I\u2019ll just compensate it back to you.\u201d Jun Wu Xie suddenly spoke up.\u201cCompensation? What are you going to use as compensation? The Jade Dew Pill cannot be bought with money, you\u2019ve glossed over such an important detail and simply making things sound easier than they really are.\u201d Mo Xuan Fei sneered.Bai Yun Xian\u2019s face turned ugly when she heard that little missy calling her Jade Dew pills \u2018play thing\u2019. This Lin Palace missy, don\u2019t know if she should call her arrogant or ignorant.Although the Jade Dew pill was not as precious as her master\u2019s Qing Yun pill, however nowhere in this world can you find the recipe other than Qing Yun clan! It\u2019s secret recipe was only exclusive to Qing Yun Clan\u2019s disciples and not any ordinary disciple had access to it. How was Jun Wu Xie going to compensate her?Jun Wu Xie paid no heed to him as she carried the little black cat and asked Mo Qian Yuan, \u201cIs there a furnace room for making pills?\u201dThat question caught Mo Qian Yuan off guard as he looked at her with wide eyes.Mo Qian Yuan had absolutely no idea what Jun Wu Xie was up to. Although he did not like Bai Yun Xian, he did not doubt her abilities, he quickly called out: \u201cWu Xie, you don\u2019t have to push it, don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t let them touch you.\u201d\u201cIs there one?\u201d Jun Wu Xie ignored his pleas and pressed on firmly.Mo Qian Yuan gave a small sigh in resignation as he called a servant over.After the pa.s.sing of his Mother, his health had deteriorated and for the initial period, the Emperor had shown him great concern and called in all the best doctors. Due to his weak body, he did not leave his residence much and to let him recover soon the Emperor had a furnace room specially constructed in the Crown Prince Residence. At first, the various arrangements made by the Emperor had touched Mo Qian Yuan deeply, he thought that his father had really wanted him to have a speedy recovery. When he had discovered the Emperor\u2019s motives, he chased away all the doctors and destroyed all the medicinal pills and elixirs that were specially prepared for him.\u201cLet him take you there, if there is anything you require, just let him know. Although the room has not been used for quite some time, I\u2019m not sure if the furnace is still usable.\u201d Mo Qian Yuan finally relented as he looked helplessly at Jun Wu Xie.Jun Wu Xie nodded and turned to follow the servant.Mo Qian Yuan looked at her back as he secretly clenched his fist.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

We are talking about Qing Yun Clan, how could their pills be so easily replicated? If I remember correctly, Jun Wu Xie has never studied any medicine before, the only reason she\u2019s doing this today is because she does not want to make a fool out of herself in front of you.\u201dWhen Jun Wu Xie had asked for the furnace room, Mo Xuan Fei laughed, although he did not like her, it was a fact that they were previously engaged although it was due to the pressure by Lin Palace. One or two things he had learned during that period of putting up with her was to be patient and had gained some insight into her temperament.Jun Wu Xie was simply an arrogant girl who was blessed with looks. If she wasn\u2019t born into Lin Palace, with that temperament of hers, who knew how many times she would have died.Make a pill? That was even more of a joke.Who did not know that Lin Palace\u2019s Missy specialized in brewing trouble, and had absolutely no talent in anything else.Even today, she wanted to personally make a pill to compensate Bai Yun Xian, would that not be an utter disgrace?From Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s perspective, this was something she would do, such an outrageous act to try to save her face in front of her favored person. She had often went beyond her means to look impressive however it was at her own cost. Keeping up with appearance has been one of the things she had tended to do although they were all beyond her means.When he suddenly thought of who her current \u2018favored person\u2019 was, his face started to be more gloomy.\u201cI don\u2019t need you to tell me what kind of person she is.\u201d Mo Qian Yuan replied coldly. He was very clear in the eyes of others, they had an ambiguous relations.h.i.+p, although in actual fact they were simply allies.Jun Wu Xie had some skills, this he knew.However her opponent was Qing Yun Clan Sovereign\u2019s disciple, and what\u2019s more, this was a secret recipe where others had no access to.She had not even touched the Jade Dew pill before, how could she refine it?\u201cIf Imperial Brother is distressed, just kill the black cat and everything will be resolved. If she is reluctant, all you need to do is to compensate her with another. We cannot let others say that our Royal Family neglected Qing Yun Clan.\u201d Mo Xuan Fei chuckled, however there was a dangerous glint in his eyes, he wanted Jun Wu Xie to know that Mo Qian Yuan is not a good choice. Even if he, Mo Xuan Fei did not want her, it was impossible between Jun Wu Xie and Mo Qian Yuan.A prince who can\u2019t even protect his own beloved woman and what\u2019s precious to her, that was simply a trash.Mo Qian Yuan glared at Mo Xuan Fei, apparently after strolling into his residence with Bai Yun Xian, he had been forgetting his decorum and had been acting more presumptuously by the minute.This idiot really thought that he was sowing a discord between their relations.h.i.+p? Really stupid.He could still vividly remember the fear from that night when that huge shadow pounced on him. No way would he ever commit the same mistake again by looking down on that little black cat.Mo Qian Yuan knew that if Mo Xuan Fei carried on what he was doing now, he would most likely be seeking death, he would experience the black shadow pouncing over him and biting his neck.On the other side of the Crown Prince\u2019s Residence, Jun Wu Xie had followed the servant to the furnace room. It was just as Mo Qian Yuan had mentioned earlier, although the room was clean, it was evident that this room had not been used in a long time as the bottom of the furnace was clean.\u201cPen and paper.\u201d Jun Wu Xie requested from the servant standing by the side.Once she had the writing materials, she quickly scribbled down a list of herbs that she needed and handed it back.The servant immediately picked up the written list and looked at it.\u201cBring this list of herbs here.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She is neither haughty nor superciliously aloof. She just \u2026.. , does not know how to get along with others \u2026.. in a normal way.Just imagine, a person kept alone from birth, it is for certain there will be repercussions on human interrelations.Jun Wu Xie was locked up thirteen long years, her world had only been herself, the mountains of medicine and treatments, and the cold and lifeless medical equipment.At that time, she barely spoke two words throughout the years. When the little black cat first met Jun Wu Xie, it thought she was mute, and autistic.She viewed everything coldly, her eyes never showing a single trace of emotion.From a young age, she was able to dissect still warm bodies unfeelingly, soaking the still fresh organs in formalin.The little black cat has always felt, its owner, is just a machine incapable of emotions.That was till the first time she learned to hate, it burned that cage that had imprisoned her.She was finally freed, but more than a decade of imprisonment had made her develop a regimented, closed up lifestyle. Coming into society, she is unable to blend and mingle with people, unable to integrate.She preferred to stay in the animal clinic, treating the animals.Though animals are incapable of speech, and Jun Wu Xie cannot fathom the behavior of people, she is very sensitive and understands the needs and pains of the animals. She knows, why they are suffering, and how to help them.At these times, Jun Wu Xie, does not need to speak.Having joined that organization, where she met her only friend, she then began to feel, like a human.Alas, the time Heaven gave her was short, everything ended before she could learn to lead a normal human life.For those who viewed Jun Wu Xie as an oddball, little black cat had hated them. It was not its owner that was odd, but it was those people who were stupid, and does not know how to get along with Jun Wu Xie. The unscrupulous little thief was the exception, and it is just proves that its owner is not without feelings, just that she does not know how to show it.Because \u2026\u2026No one ever taught her.But with the Jun Family father and son, the little black cat believes, its owner will be able to go far on this road to being normal!Meanwhile, the servant sent a lot of herbs, and the medicine furnace fire was rekindled, and the temperature in the room started to rise.Jun Wu Xie had everyone leave the room, sorted out all the herbs, to treat and process them, her eyes lowered in concentration. In this moment, she was back in those thirteen years of captivity, with the same eyes, familiar movements of the hands, absorbed into her medical prowess.Extraction, grinding, crus.h.i.+ng \u2026\u2026 Jun Wu Xie\u2019s soft and fair hands seemed imbued with magic, all that pa.s.sed those hands, in the blink of an eye, was processed with impeccable precision.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Though she is unable to produce western medicine, chinese medicine is a breeze for her.Seeing the herbs being processed one by one, little black cat lay there swinging its tail, unable to shake off the feeling of familiarity with the scene playing out in front of it.In the past decade, is that not exactly what Jun Wu Xie does? Holed up in the room, labouring over countless heaps of herbs?In the study, Bai Yun Xian looked on coldly as Mo Xuan Fei and Mo Qian Yuan were engaged in an intense war of words.Light was fading, as sunset approached, the Imperial City was aglow in the last vestiges of the warmth from the waning sun, enshrouding the palace in a veil of intoxicating beauty.\u201cHow long do I have to wait?\u201d Mo Xuan Fei looked out at the sky, his patience gradually dissipating.It has been more than half a day, Jun Wu Xie was still nowhere in sight. He even suspected that in order to protect her, Mo Qian Yuan had even asked his people to secretly hidden her away.He stood up, intending to check on it.\u201cImpatience? My brother?\u201d Mo Qian Yuan raised his eyebrows in ridicule as he looked up at Mo Xuan Fei, a sneer on his face.Mo Xuan Fei was now relying on Bai Yun Xian\u2019s background and his actions were getting impetuous and out of hand. He had almost completely disregarded the Crown Prince status.\u201cThis is the Crown Prince Residence, where you wield absolute dominance, where you can do anything without a single soul knowing. \u00a0I just hope that you do not cause any friction with Qing Yun Clan because of a small matter. I will remind you to bear in mind that Qing Yun Clan is not to be slighted.\u201d \u00a0Mo Xuan Fei said retorted.\u201cHiding behind a woman\u2019s skirt and you can still be so proud?\u201d An icy voice sounded from a distance. Although her voice still had a hint of immaturity in it, but every word was articulated properly and it was as though each word was doused in ice water.Outside the door, Jun Wu Xie was standing there with the warm orange sunlight s.h.i.+ning\u00a0on her back, her whole body had a faint glow. With her pure white robe basking under the magnificence of the golden sunlight, everything seemed unreal. With the little black cat lying on her shoulder, this contrast in black and white was so striking, and in her small hands held a white porcelain bottle, this scene was as if she walked out of a dream.\u201cWu Xie.\u201d Mo Qian Yuan stood up in awe, as if his body did not belong to him. Under the beautiful golden dusk, she was a sight to behold.This beautiful scene had also impacted Mo Xuan Fei who imprinted this deep within his mind as he looked on in a daze. Bai Yun Xian had caught sight of his reaction and nibbled her lower lip.Jun Wu Xie walked into the room and placed the porcelain bottle on the table as she carried the little black cat and took a seat.\u201cHere\u2019s your compensation.\u201d Jun Wu Xie did not look at Mo Xuan Fei but directly at Bai Yun Xian.Bai Yun Xian furrowed her eyebrows.Mo Xuan Fei was still in a trance, only when he had happened to see the displeasure in Bai Yun Xian\u2019s eyes did he come to his senses. He hardened his heart and immediately asked: \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cJade Dew pill\u201d Jun Wu Xie replied.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s mouth twitched slightly, he had thought that Mo Qian Yuan had sent her away in secret and did not think she was still loitering around. She even had the audacity to claim that the bottle on the table was a bottle of Jade Dew pills!\u201cJun Wu Xie, this is quite a claim you are making! This thing here is the Jade Dew pill?\u201d Even if you beat him to death, he would never believe that she could refine the Jade Dew pill.\u201cBai Yun Xian would know.\u201d Jun Wu Xie did not bother explaining anything. If these two men started their banter and kicking up a fuss, who knew how long this would take? She was not interested in wasting time.Mo Xuan Fei was about to say something but Bai Yun Xian stood up and picked the bottle up from the table.\u201cMiss Jun, your cat ruined my pills, I do not mind, but now you just stuff something in a bottle and say its Jade Dew pills? That is an insult to our Qing Yun Clan\u2019s reputation and I won\u2019t allow it!\u201d Bai Yun Xian glared at Jun Wu Xie.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Based on the time needed to refine this pill, it\u2019s already wrong. To completely refine the Jade Dew pill, you need at least three to five days. You spent only half a day and you claim it\u2019s the Jade Dew pill? Do you think I\u2019m a child and you can easily fool me?\u201d Bai Yun Xian laughed coldly, she absolutely did not believe that the contents in the porcelain bottle was the Jade Dew pill.The refining method to this pill was unique to their Qing Yun Clan, others did not know that the time to refine such a pill would take such a long time. This Lin Palace Missy simply wanted to pull a fast one and stuffed some medicinal pills, claiming the contents in the bottle to be the Jade Dew pills. If she let such mockery drag on, it would really be a huge joke.\u201cThree to five days?\u201d Jun Wu Xie raised her eyes and looked at Bai Yun Xian in a condescending manner as if challenging her.Bai Yun Xian sneered.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you say something after verifying it?\u201dAfter talking so much, wouldn\u2019t the facts speak for itself?\u201cThere is no need for that.\u201d Bai Yun Xian scoffed as she raised the bottle up in an attempt to throw it.Mo Qian Yuan swiftly got up, with a set of resolute eyes, he said, \u201cMiss Bai, why are you in such a hurry? We just need to verify the contents of the bottle. Unless Miss Bai is worried that you aren\u2019t able to recognize the Jade Dew pill?\u201d Mo Qian Yuan secretly clenched his fists under his long sleeves. After hearing the time needed to refine the Jade Dew pill, his mind was thrown into disarray.However when he saw that Jun Wu Xie was cool and composed, he did not know why but his heart had also calmed down.Her expression was still serene and remained unaffected by Bai Yun Xian\u2019s comments.He should believe her, he told himself.Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s unconditional trust towards Jun Wu Xie had prompted his previous actions and his questions had forced Bai Yun Xian to do a verification.Yes,\u00a0forced to.\u201cYour Highness, what do you mean?\u201d Bai Yun Xian\u2019s expression was getting uglier and uglier.\u201cI\u2019m sure Miss Bai is able to determine Qing Yun Clan pills quite easily, and you are a very sensible person. Regardless whether the pills refined by Jun Wu Xie are the Jade Dew pills, if you do not personally verify it, it might cast a doubt whether or not you have the ability to accurately verify if the pill is genuine or not? Others might think you may be eager to destroy evidence?\u201d Mo Qian Yuan had made his decision to carry this through with determination.Bai Yun Xian had no way to back down. If she does not validate it, wouldn\u2019t it let their imaginations run wild and they might really think of something so preposterous?\u201cYour Highness is this determined to protect Jun Wu Xie? If that\u2019s the case, then I shall do as you wish. However, if the pills which she has refined are not the Jade Dew pills, then Your Highness will also bear the same guilt of slandering my Qing Yun Clan.\u201d Bai Yun Xian replied curtly.\u201cAlright.\u201d Mo Qian Yuan gritted his teeth, he was going all in.Mo Xuan Fei secretly sneered, it was not that he didn\u2019t pave a road for Mo Qian Yuan, he was suicidal and was courting his own death.Regardless whether the Crown Prince has power or not, the Emperor and Mo Xuan Fei cannot touch him directly as they needed to uphold their reputation. Now that he had threaded on this path of no return on his own by offending Qing Yun Clan, they did not need to dirty their own hands and let Qing Yun Clan crush him.Mo Qian Yuan ah, Mo Qian Yuan, you are stupid beyond redemption.

With Mo Qian Yuan\u2019s intervention, she remains silent.With Mo Qian Yuan dragging Qing Yun Clan\u2019s name into this, Bai Yun Xian was forced to verify the pills\u2019 authenticity. Veiled under her calm exterior, her heart fostered a deep hatred for Jun Wu Xie and Mo Qian Yuan, as no one has ever dared to speak in such a manner to her.Bai Yun Xian smiles coldly, and opens the medicine bottle.In the brief moment the lid is opened, a balmy fragrance permeates the air, an all too familiar smell, exactly like the Jade Dew pills scattered on the ground.Bai Yun Xian paled, eyes widened in surprise.\u201cImpossible \u2026..\u201d As a disciple of Qing Yun Clan, Bai Yun Xian had made the Jade Dew pills countless times, and its fragrance, is deeply ingrained into her heart.The smell from this bottle, is exactly the same?The flabbergasted look on Bai Yun Xian made Mo Xuan Fei sit up tensed, his face darkening.\u201cAre you convinced?\u201d Jun Wu Xie asks, eyebrows slightly raised, bringing her cup of tea to her mouth, slowly, calmly sipping.\u201cI am not done.\u201d Bai Yun Xian answers, through gritted teeth.Pills glistening like white jade poured from the bottle into his hand, no different from those scattered across the floor. Bai Yun Xian turned the pills over and over again in meticulous scrutiny, as a chill crept into her heart.These are clearly Jade Dew pills!\u201cHow could this be \u2026\u2026\u201d Bai Yun Xian\u2019s lips trembled, unable to believe herself.Mo Xuan Fei saw the disbelief in Bai Yun Xian\u2019s eyes and his heart sank. He hurriedly jumps to his feet, and insinuates: \u201cEven though the appearance and smell do have similarities, the pills are after all fake. Rest a.s.sured Yun Xian, for the insolence Jun Wu Xie has shown you and the disrespect to Qing Yun Clan, justice will be meted out.\u201dI will not allow Bai Yun Xian to admit the authenticity of those Jade Dew pills!Bai Yun Xian looked blankly at Mo Xuan Fei, before it dawned on her.That\u2019s right, it is up to her to say whether those Jade Dew pills are real or fake. If she proclaims them fake, they will be deemed fake, irregardless of authenticity.Bai Yun Xian composed herself, putting up her usual cold front.\u201cMiss Jun, these are not Jade Dew pills of the Qing Yun Clan.\u201d\u201cI see now what disciples of Qing Yun Clan are like.\u201d said Jun Wu Xie as she threw a bitingly frosty glance at Bai Yun Xian who was struggling to maintain her forced facade of calm.Bai Yun Xian felt chilled from those eyes.\u201cIf they are not Jade Dew pills, what are they?\u201d Jun Wu Xie asked, head tilted slightly, staring at Bai Yun Xian.\u201cThey are just some spices, can\u2019t even call them medicine.\u201d said Bai Yun Xian stiffly.\u201cOh?\u201d Jun Wu Xie questioned as her eyes flashed.\u201cMiss Jun, trying to pa.s.s off these inferior imitations as the real deal, I must say I have been rather slighted.\u201d Bai Yun Xian Jun intoned seeing Jun Wu Xie\u2019s silence, confident the situation is under her control.Jun Wu Xie sat calmly stroking the little black cat. Bai Yun Xian was about to continue on her tirade when Jun Wu Xie murmured: \u201cI sent a bottle to His Majesty.\u201dBai Yun Xian stood with her mouth agape, twitching.What did she say!\u201cBy now, the Imperial Doctors who should have verified it\u2019s authenticity, and sent it to His Majesty.\u201d Jun Wu Xie raised her eyes, watching the paled and stiffened face of Bai Yun Xian.Bai Yun Xian\u2019s stood lips trembling, reeling from the shock.Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s face darkened, he never would have imagined, Jun Wu Xie hid such a hand!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Any medication taken by the Emperor, has to be ascertained by the Imperial Doctors to be safe, before it can reach him. The Imperial Doctors might be be able to replicate the myriad medicines pa.s.sing through their hands, they can easily determine their properties.Mo Xuan Fei had intended for Bai Yun Xian to declare the pills to be fake, \u00a0rendering Jun Wu Xie unable to refute. After all, no one will believe a n.o.body like Jun Wu Xie, over the words of a disciple of the esteemed Qing Yun Clan.No one could have thought, Jun Wu Xie had prepared her hand so well against the treachery, before the pill verification.Being in the hands of the Emperor, the Jade Dew pills gifted by Bai Yun Xian must have pa.s.sed through the Imperial Doctors, who have checked on their properties and content. Having them verify if these pills here are the same will be easy to ascertain.Judging from Bai Yun Xian\u2019s reaction, Mo Xuan Fei can guess that the Jade Dew pills Jun Wu Xie brought are genuine!When did Jun Wu Xie become so intelligent?Mo Qian Yuan watched this scene unfold from the sidelines, heaved a sigh of relief, a hint of a smile as the ends of his mouth curled up, watching Jun Wu Xie intently.This seemingly young, quiet girl, is more capable than she seems!Jun Wu Xie could have asked Bai Yun Xian to send the pills to the Imperial Doctors for verification, but she held back, luring Bai Yun Xian to declare the pills were fake, before she revealed she sent the bottle to the Emperor.When Imperial Doctors can ascertain authenticity of Jade Dew pills, and Bai Yun Xian cannot, it can only mean she lacks the ability to ascertain, or she harbours ill will and deliberately made a false declaration!What is said cannot be undone, this stroke of genius from Jun Wu Xie is equivalent to a slap on the face of Bai Yun Xian.A resounding slap!With a single move, Jun Wu Xie has Bai Yun Xian slapped senseless, and pinned down Mo Xuan Fei.He looked upon Jun Wu Xie in disbelief, a stranger to him.Is this not the fawning girl who followed behind yearning and craving attention? Or the boorish, rude and mindless idiot?Why does the Jun Wu Xie here feels so unfamiliar, so distant?He had thought, Jun Wu Xie\u2019s cold and aloof manner to him was due to her being abandoned over Bai Yun Xian, and in an attempt to catch his attention, she imitated the cold mannerisms of Bai Yun Xian, thinking that he liked that about her. It is clear now, it was just all wishful thinking on his part.The Jun Wu Xie of the past, does not even know medicine, let alone making Jade Dew pills. Hiding her hand, by secretly sending the pills to the Emperor, the Jun Wu Xie he knew should not have been capable of such!Now, in this situation, it feels like slaps across the face of Mo Xuan Fei, knocking him off his pedestal of arrogance, and driving the despair of defeat deep into him.No!He will not allow that to happen!\u201cJun Wu Xie, that was wilful of you, how can you send that to my Imperial Father, the Emperor?

It is clear if the Royal Doctors are to verify the Jade Dew pills as the real deal, she will suffer utter disgrace and humiliation.Jun Wu Xie sat there watching Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s dramatic antics, making no move to stop him.With Jun Wu Xie\u2019s inaction, Mo Qian Yuan jeered after the departing figures.\u201cSecond Brother, why the hurry? If there are issue with the pills, the Royal Doctors will not allow medicine of dubious origins to reach our Imperial Father.\u201d Mo Qian Yuan taunted with a smile at the fl.u.s.tered Mo Xuan Fei, in return for the oppression suffered at the hands of Mo Xuan Fei all this time, freeing the heavy knot in his chest.Being helpless himself against Mo Xuan Fei, it was a grand sight to behold seeing Jun Wu Xie\u2019s resounding \u2018slap\u2019 on Mo Xuan Fei. That felt really good!Mo Xuan Fei was in no mood to bicker with Mo Qian Yuan, he just needed an excuse to leave quickly. Irregardless whether he can stop the Royal Doctors, as long as he leaves the Crown Prince Residence now, he could pretend that none of today\u2019s events ever happened and salvage some dignity for Bai Yun Xian and him.Alas, the Heavens seemed to be against Mo Xuan Fei. Before he could scamper out of the Crown Prince Residence, two palace eunuchs scurried forward, carrying a tray of jewels, wide smiles across their faces.\u201cYour Highness, Miss Bai, I was thinking I will find you here. The Jade Dew pills from Miss Bai have been received and His Majesty has gifted these jewels for Miss Bai\u2019s pleasure.\u201d The eunuch bearing the gifts was His Majesty\u2019s personal senior eunuch, obsequiously smiling.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Mo Xuan Fei could not believe his ears.The eunuch was somewhat taken aback by Mo Xuan Fei grim expression, and stammered.\u201cHi \u2026\u2026 His Majesty, ordered your \u2026.. lowly servant \u2026\u2026 to send these gifts over\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou said Yun Xian sent the pills to Imperial Father?\u201d Mo Xuan Fei stared, eyes wide in astonishment, Bai Yun Xian paled further, blood drained from her face.The eunuch did not know what to make of the situation, Jade Dew pills are exclusive to the Qing Yun Clan, they must have been sent by Bai Yun Xian.Mo Qian Yuan looked on at the stupefied people by his doorway, his mouth curled up in scorn, and turned to see Jun Wu Xie, calmly head lowered, still sipping her tea.Jun Wu Xie had known Mo Xuan Fei would develop cold feet, and weasel his way out. She secretly sent the pills to His Majesty and sent it under Bai Yun Xian\u2019s name! The Emperor, to garner support from Qing Yun Clan, will gift in return, oblivious to the fact that will cut off his way out of this mess.With the gifts here, it just showed that the pills sent by Jun Wu Xie have been verified by the Royal Doctors, and conveyed to the Emperor.It is now clear, whether those Jade Dew Pills were genuine.The eunuch\u2019s uncanny timing with his arrival bearing the gifts, did not give Mo Xuan Fei any wiggling room.\u201cJun Wu Xie, you dare deceive His Majesty! Those pills were clearly not from Yun Xian!\u201d Mo Xuan Fei eyes full of malice, refusing to be toyed around by Jun Wu Xie, a woman he once abandoned, it was intolerable.Jun Wu Xie slightly raised an eyebrow, \u201cIt belongs to her.\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense!\u201dJun Wu Xie said indifferently: \u201cReplacement for the bottle my cat broke.\u201dShe had a.s.sured, she will compensate Bai Yun Xian for the Jade Dew pills.\u201cThe result is plain to see, Bai Yun Xian, your conclusion?\u201d Jun Wu Xie fixed her frosty gaze upon the pale quivering frame of Bai Yun Xian.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was impossible she can process and produce those Jade Dew pills!Moreover, she achieved it in half a day! It was already unimaginable she produced a bottle of Jade Dew pills in such a short span of time, she made TWO bottles at that!\u201cYour furnace room is old and falling apart, and that wasted a lot of my time refining the pills.\u201d Jun Wu Xie grumbled at Mo Qian Yuan.Due to the furnace room being run down due to disuse and neglect, and much of the equipments left not functionable, Jun Wu Xie would have produced five instead of two measly bottles.Mo Qian Yuan stifled his laughter at the thought of Bai Yun Xian declaring that the production of Jade Dew pills needed three to five days, and Jun Wu Xie\u2019s nasty rebuke by producing two bottles within half a day. To add insult to injury, she now claims my furnace room is dilapidated and equipment spoilt, causing her delays in production, telling Bai Yun Xian that she is capable of more in ideal conditions?This unspoken reprimand and innocent grumbling, had delivered another two slaps upon the face of Bai Yun Xian.Such exhilaration! You could almost hear them!Mo Qian Yuan finally understood Jun Wu Xie\u2019s contempt for Jade Dew pills.Bai Yun Xian\u2019s praise for her unparalleled jeweled Jade Dew pills, in the hands of Jun Wu Xie, had turned to mere worthless rocks, being thrown upon the face of Bai Yun Xian.\u201cJun Wu Xie, how did you come to know the recipe for Qing Yun Clan\u2019s medicine!\u201d Bai Yun Xian was seething with anger, as she had never been so humiliated.Jun Wu Xie replied nonchalantly : \u201cYou need a recipe for this? You can tell just by smelling them.\u201d\u201c \u2026.. \u201c Bai Yun Xian almost foamed at the mouth with her dismissive tone.Mo Xuan Fei, sensing that the situation steering out of control, held Bai Yun Xian\u2019s by her shoulder.\u201cWe were just kidding today, it is getting late, we should go.\u201d Mo Xuan Fei said abruptly, thinking they have been humiliated enough and staying any longer wouldl only embarra.s.s them further.\u201cNo hurry, my dear brother. Miss Bai has not verified the pills\u2019 authenticity.\u201d Mo Qian Yuan was unwilling to let him off easy.Bai Yun Xian glared at Jun Wu Xie, murder in her eyes.Struggling to find the words, she faintly mumbled: \u201cThose pills are \u2026.. Jade Dew pills.\u201dThose words seemed to have drained her completely as she stumbled, her legs giving out..\u201cYun Xian!\u201d Mo Xuan Fei rushed to hold her up, and through gritted teeth : \u201cWe shall not impose on you anymore, Yun Xian seems unwell, we will catch up again another day.\u201dWithout waiting for Mo Qian Yuan\u2019s reply, Mo Yuan Fei hastened out, holding Yun Xian up.The eunuch bearing the gifts, confused, hurriedly hastened behind the Second Prince, to present the jewels.When everyone has left, Mo Qian Yuan could not suppress his mirth anymore and laughed out heartily.\u201cJun Wu Xie, Jun Wu Xie, you greatly surprise me, the humiliation you put my brother and Bai Yun Xian through today, it was a sight to behold! You withheld the truth in the beginning, luring them to sink in deeper by allowing them to brag more, before you dropped the axe. That was simply wicked! Ha ha ha.\u201dJun Wu Xie glanced at Mo Qian Yuan laughing heartily, and thought to herself.Wicked? I don\u2019t think so.The humiliation they suffered today was their own doing. Evil begets evil.\u201cBut, your actions today will earn the wrath of the two of them.\u201d warned Mo Qian Yuan.\u201cIt\u2019s bound to happen.\u201d Jun Wu Xie lowered her eyes, hiding the lethal glance that flashed briefly in her eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Before that, they need to build up their bodies, and fortify their tendons, arteries and veins, in preparation for the awakening. Originally, before she took over this body, Jun Xian conditioned and cultivated Jun Wu Xie from a young tender age intensively in preparation for her spiritual awakening, and made it extremely receptive to spiritual cultivation now.From age fourteen onwards, people have to rely on the contractual spirits to endlessly cultivate their spiritual energy, as their spiritual energy increases, the spirit absorbs more, allowing them to grow.They are intertwined and interdependent.When an average person starts cultivating their spiritual energy, the body is able to gather a minute amount of it and to have the energy manifest outwards would take anyone at least half a year\u2019s time.However, Jun Wu Xie only took half a month\u2019s time to accomplish this, if anyone knew this, they would be frightened to death!Jun Wu Xie suddenly retracted everything as the red glow vanished, the next moment, there was a knock on the door.After she started cultivating, her five senses had been heightened.\u201cCome in.\u201dThe door creaked open as Long Qi stood outside as he gave a respectful bow: \u201cSecond Master has invited Miss to see him.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dLong Qi led the way as he brought her to the underground training grounds, it was an expansive land and it looked awe-inspiring as weapons filled the four majestic walls surrounding it.At the centre was a lone figure, holding a sword relentlessly practising his sword moves, as the movements were swift and fierce, fluid and sharp, his robe was soaked with perspiration, however he did not seem to care as he continued on with a firm determination.\u201cUncle.\u201d Jun Wu Xie called out to him.Once he heard her, Jun Qing immediately sheathed his sword into the scabbard on his back as he gave her clear and bright smile.\u201cYou\u2019re here, Wu Xie.\u201dJun Wu Xie gave a quick a.n.a.lysis as she looked at him from head to toe. No one could have imagined that just not too long ago, the very same person was crippled that was just half a step into death\u2019s door.Ever since Jun Qing he discovered he could stand, he had been secretly training, pus.h.i.+ng himself to his limits daily, in this hidden training grounds, in an attempt to make up for the time lost when he did not have use of his legs.\u201cI asked you here today seeing the weather has been nice lately, and thought it would be nice to have my lovely niece accompany me to enjoy this equally beautiful spring.\u201d Jun Qing smiled warmly and handed the sword over to Long Qi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The entire time, her eyes were lowered while she stroked and caressed the cat sitting quietly in her lap.Looking at Jun Wu Xie, Jun Qing could not help but sigh.Jun Wu Xie had never been talkative from a young age, but seeing this blossoming girl so withdrawn, still so quiet, does make one worry.After some time, the carriage finally stopped. Long Qi helped Jun Xian down from the carriage, and Jun Wu Xie followed suit.After getting off the carriage, she looked around to see where she was and was taken aback.Just meters away, an army garrison stood, Jun Wu Xie turned to look back, the Imperial City sat far off in the distance. Unknowingly, the horse carriage had taken them out of the Imperial City.\u201cThe Jun family is famous for their Rui Lin Army, as a daughter of the Jun Family, you will have to come here sooner or later.\u201d Jun Qing proclaimed, sitting in the wheelchair, with Long Qi pus.h.i.+ng him from behind.\u201cMiss, please come with me.\u201d Long Qi asked respectfully, pus.h.i.+ng the wheelchair into the barracks.The Rui Lin Army, the most ferocious army in the State of Qi, had proven their mettle on countless battlefields. Their reputation preceded them, it kept their enemies holed up behind their borders for many long years.In recent years, State of Qi enjoyed stability at their borders, only then did Jun Xian pull back the Rui Lin Army. To avoid suspicion from the Emperor, Jun Xian handed over most of the military might over and garrisoned the barracks away from the Imperial City. He housed the Jun family of three within the Imperial City, to put the Emperor at ease of any rebellion, with their three lives within the grasp of the Emperor.It was known, only the descendants of the Jun Family can command the Rui Lin Army.With the lives of the Jun Family in your hands, you control the Rui Lin Army indirectly.It was the first time Jun Wu Xie had set foot in the Rui Lin Army barracks, for her and for this body as well.It was high noon, the sun was beating down strongly, in the huge expanse of the barracks, only one group of soldiers were on patrol, the whole encampment was silent.With Long Qi leading with the wheelchair, he brought Jun Wu Xie deep into the barracks. Enveloped in utter silence, Jun Wu Xie followed behind without a word, intently observing all that she saw.There was no one in the barracks, there was no sign of the Rui Lin Army out at the garrison. The notoriously feared Rui Lin Army seems to have disappeared into thin air.However, the moment when Jun Wu Xie came to the training grounds, her eyes widened.Rows upon rows, soldiers fully armored, under the scorching sun, weapons gripped in hands, engaged in mock battle, in uniformed unison. The heavy still air within stirred into a warm rush, from the forceful slashes of the weapons.Feeling the warm rush up close, it felt oppressive and overwhelming.\u201cThis is our Jun Family\u2019s Rui Lin Army, our sharpest sword, Wu Xie, remember, this sword, can only be wielded by the Jun Family.\u201d Jun Qing turned, his smile faded, his eyes steeled, chilling to look at.Rui Lin Army, it can be the strongest talisman of the Jun Family, protecting them for centuries, but it can also attract the suspicions of the Emperor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Such a highly disciplined and ferocious army!\u201cThe Rui Lin Army, as a whole can defeat the enemies, fragmented can take the enemy general\u2019s head. Remember this, Jun Wu Xie, no army in Qi, matches up to even a minute fraction of the Rui Lin Army. The Emperor had generally left the Lin Palace to its own devices, because we command such a formidable force.\u201d Jun Qing\u2019s eyes no longer showed the soft pampering gaze of her uncle, but the gaze of a commander of an army, steadfast, and proud.Any soldier picked out from the Rui Lin Army can easily take on five grown men in a brawl. One wonders what it must have taken the Jun Family, to shed how much sweat and blood, in what way, to achieve command of such a formidable force, willing to fight under the Jun Family\u2019s banner.No one knows.Many have tried to poach from the Rui Lin Army, they have either died at their hands, or unceremoniously thrown out.They are the sharpest blade, a blade that will never point at the Jun Family!\u201cI understand, Uncle.\u201d replied Jun Wu Xie, hiding the awe she is feeling. This trip to the Rui Lin Army was not a mere tour, Jun Qing has deemed Jun Wu Xie, qualified to know of their outstanding army, and no longer looked at her as an innocent and ignorant kid, but as one of the Jun Family\u2019s stalwart pillars.Jun Qing softened his gaze and nodded his head.\u201cYour coming to the barracks today, was the intention of me and your grandfather. There is something, we have to give you.\u201d Jun Qing gestured to Long Qi.Long Qi handed over a brocade bag to Jun Wu Xie.Outlined on the black brocade bag, with silver silk thread, was a *Qilin (Chinese mythical creature), treading on clouds, an auspicious sign. There were three tubes, as wide as her finger, in the bag and Jun Wu Xie looked up in wonder at her Uncle.Jun Qing explained: \u201cThose are Soaring Cloud Signals\u00a0of the Rui Lin Army, pull the lever on the Soaring Cloud Signal\u00a0and a flare will fire high into the sky, bringing the Rui Lin Army to you. Wu Xie, your grandfather and me were worried you would be rash at such a young age, unable to weigh the severity, and were hesitant to hand you something that mobilizes the Rui Lin Army. However, you have recently surprised us with the huge changes in you, and both your grandfather and I agree, you are mature enough to handle the Soaring Cloud Signal.\u201d The Soaring Cloud Signal, to the Jun Family, is something very closed guarded. Once the signal flare is fired, it mobilizes the entire Rui Lin Army.The shows the trust bestowed upon Jun Wu Xie, by Jun Xian and Jun Qing. They have handed the sharpest blade, over to Jun Wu Xie.\u201cThank you.\u201d was all Jun Wu Xie could manage, the three tiny tubes were light, but the implications it came with weighed a ton.\u201cWe are family, no thanks needed.\u201d Jun Qing smiled, he knew, they were in Jun Wu Xie\u2019s good hands.Recently, Jun Wu Xie had been on close terms with the Crown Prince, and the Crown Prince health was improving, as was his temperament. His reputation which had vastly improved both in Court and among the commoners, was a good thing, except to the eyes of some \u2013 it was something else.Lin Palace will s.h.i.+eld Jun Wu Xie from any harm, for anyone scheming otherwise, shall best reconsider, whether they can withstand the might of the whole Rui Lin Army storming down in vengeance!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This razor sharp blade has killed many who had plotted against the Jun Family, and weighed heavily even on the Emperor\u2019s mind, deterring any moves against them.Jun Xian and Jun Qing had backed down and ceded their authority, as there had been none capable enough to succeed the Rui Lin Army.Now, that has changed!After her return from the Rui Lin Army barracks, Jun Wu Xie went straight to the pharmacy.The sharp blade of the Jun Family, must be honed further.From that day on, Jun Wu Xie never left the Lin Palace, holed up in the pharmacy, having heaps of medicinal herbs delivered everyday. Despite being absent from the Crown Prince residence, Mo Qian Yuan had sent Jade Nectar to her every other day.Even the budding lotus was moved to the pharmacy and no one knew what she was doing in there.Jun Wu Yao pushed the door open and saw the pet.i.te frame, leaning back on the chair, fast asleep.Jun Wu Xie\u2019s tranquil beauty shone as she slept, with the absence of her usual cold and distant self.Jun Wu Yao glanced at the crates in the corner, strode over to Jun Wu Xie and gently carried her up.\u201cMeow.\u201d The little black cat asleep upon the knees of Jun Wu Xie stirred, looked up at Jun Wu Yao once, and snuggled back into the embrace of Jun Wu Xie, asleep.[\u2026\u2026\u2026.]The little black cat\u2019s movements roused her and Jun Wu Xie opened her eyes briefly. Seeing the mischievous face of Jun Wu Yao, she closed her eyes again.\u201cIf I did not come here, you intend to make the pharmacy your home?\u201d Jun Wu Yao asked, an eyebrow raised.\u201cHow long did I sleep for?\u201d Jun Wu Xie rubbed the sleep from her eyes, a crystalline tear at the corner.\u201cWhy are you working so hard? The Rui Lin Army is already so strong, you are not a robot! You cannot possibly produce fortification medicine for an army alone!\u201d Sitting down on a chair, Jun Wu Yao placed her on his lap, gently curling stray strands of her hair behind her ears.\u201cWhy not?\u201d Jun Wu Xie countered.Medicine for an army of a hundred thousand might be overwhelming, but with her speed, it could be done.Jun Wu Yao laughed and leaned over and rested his forehead on her forehead as he said tenderly: \u201cI thought you only cared about the father and son of the Jun Family.\u201dWithin a month, tens of crates of fortification medicine, every single one packed to its brim were ready.The soldiers in the Rui Lin Army are all grown men, and have cultivated their spiritual energies for a long time. The harsh military training have developed their bodies to excessive extends, but their veins and arteries, crucial in the spiritual development, were hard to develop. It is widely known, the stronger the veins and arteries, the faster the spiritual development.Before one turns into an adult, one can strengthen the veins and arteries with medicine. Once they reach adulthood, and the veins and arteries mature, it is difficult to strengthen or develop them any further.Within the vast lands, many have sought to find ways to develop the veins and arteries of adults, very few have succeeded.Not Bai Yun Xian, nor her master.Not even the Sovereign of Qing Yun Clan can develop medicine such as this, but Jun Wu Xie was churning them out as if they did not require money , intending to give out tens of thousands pills free, to mere soldiers who were commoners.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She walked to the furnace, adding more firewood.The furnace, was requested from Jun Qing after visiting the barracks.It was huge, yet finely detailed, most suitable for the production of ma.s.sive quant.i.ties.Production of fortification medicine for an army of a hundred thousand, was an insurmountable task.But in the hands of Jun Wu Xie, it was relatively easy for her.For an average pract.i.tioner of medicine, they avoid ma.s.s production of any medicine, due to the inability to control the various precise quant.i.ties of herbs in the doses, resulting in blunders.It was not a problem for Jun Wu Xie, as in her past life, her grasp and control of medicine, were more precise than machines. Medicine produced under her hands, were always flawless.Let Lin Palace\u2019s Rui Lin Army, the sharpest blade, be honed further!Jun Wu Yao, chin in his palm, watched lazily as Jun Wu Xie busied herself. He rubbed his long slender fingers together, feeling the lingering warmth from the body of Jun Wu Xie.This girl, I must say, has moves both smooth and bold! His lips curled up as he watched her concentrating and effortlessly making more and more.While Jun Wu Xie was busy with the medicine, another scene was unfolding in the Imperial Palace\u2026.After the humiliating episode at the Crown Prince Palace at the hands of Jun Wu Xie, Bai Yun Xian had been moody ever since. Mo Xuan Fei had tried all ways and means to cheer her up, but to no avail.Having been snubbed by the lady, Mo Xuan Fei went to the Emperor.\u201cFather, Jun Wu Xie is getting rather impertinent, will you continue to indulge them?\u201d Mo Xuan Fei implored, kneeling in the Imperial Study, brows knitted as though in pain.The Emperor looked up from the scrolls he was perusing, \u201cI have told you countless times to stay away from the Crown Prince Residence.\u201dMo Xuan Fei bit down on his lip, and implored further: \u201cBut, the change in the Crown Prince recently has been strange! His health is improving, temperament reverting back to normal, goes out of the Imperial Palace frequently, spreading benevolence in the city\u2026 He is planning something! I, \u2026.. your son and va.s.sal, does not feel at ease.\u201dWith the poison from the Wheat Night Flower purged, Mo Qian Yuan had regained his strength. With his finesse and natural flair, it was easy as pie to win over the hearts of people. Mother to Mo Qian Yuan, the late Queen, her virtuous fame widely spread throughout the lands, made the people more receptive to him.Sensing Mo Qian Yuan\u2019s strong comeback, Mo Xuan Fei was getting restless.The Emperor sighed, \u201cYou mentioned the other day, the Jade Dew pills were made by Jun Wu XIe. Was that true?\u201dMo Xuan Fei hesitated a moment, and said: \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWith the exclusive recipe for Jade Dew pills with Qing Yun Clan, how did Jun Wu Xie learn that? Moreover, you know too well her temperament, arrogant and ignorant, how is it possible for her?\u201d The Emperor gazed down at his kneeling son, with eyes narrowed.\u201cThat\u2026.. Your son does not know, it is said though, that Lin Palace has recently gathered lots of medical books. May\u2026..be\u2026.. The Lin Palace is secretly in contact with someone, who in turn teaches Jun Wu Xie medicine.\u201d Mo Xuan Fei\u2019s brows furrowed deeper, at the thought that Jun Wu Xie was able to produce Jade Dew Pills. It was simply unbelievable.\u201cFather! Jun Qing was poisoned previously, the Imperial Doctors declared he did not have long to live. It has been quite a long while since and things have been quiet at the Lin Palace, Jun Qing is holding on till now, all these smells rather fishy!\u201d\u201cHmm? If what you say is true, there is a gifted doctor in Lin Palace?\u201d The Emperor queried, his gaze turning cold.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
