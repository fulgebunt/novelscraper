    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1 \u2013 The servant who sweepsNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA new day begins, and Kai Yang woke up. He cleaned up and took the broom lying in the corner of the small room and walked out. Standing at the front door, he stretched a little. He looked up at the touch of grey in the dawn sky and closed his eyes while breathing in deeply. He was enjoying this moment of peace, before reopening his eyes to start sweeping the ground, cleaning away the dirt and leaves.Dressed in black clothes that were simple and clean. The aged clothing colour for no reason, highlighted the youth\u2019s loneliness and years of isolation here. Kai Yang\u2019s spine was as straight as a javelin, and with his face had a meticulous expression. Even though he was completing the lowest ranked job. His actions were very calm, he didn\u2019t exert much force on the broom, his body didn\u2019t even move that much. With only the rotation of his wrist, the broom moved effortlessly. When his body moved, the dust and trash on the ground seemed to magically accumulate in one place around him, just like they had grown a pair feet.Kai Yang was the Sky Tower\u2019s experimental disciple. For three he had trained in the school, but he had only reached the tempered body third stage. Yet the other disciples that had entered at the same time as him had long surpassed him and reached higher stages. They were all able to enter into the main building, pay their respects and make advances towards their futures. While he can only lament about his inadequacy in the outer courts.The tempered body third stage in three years cannot be called bad or good, but really, really mediocre.Helplessly, Kai Yang could only continue to sweep out here in the outer court. Working hard to support himself and working hard in training.Sky Tower School is a very unique school. This uniqueness is seen through the ruthless competition between disciples. In the school, the strong are like kings, while the weak are eliminated. The strong eat the weak; the law of the jungle, in the Sky Tower School is actively followed by all.In other schools you may be able to school friendly competition, brotherly bonds and people working together to achieve the same goal. But in the Sky Tower school, you will only be able to false bonds, in order to use each other and rise in power. Stepping over each other\u2019s bodies is the only way.Under Sky Tower\u2019s strict system, it\u2019s well-known throughout the entire Han Dynasty. Although the grounds were not that large, but due to the brutal nature of their disciples, their might is second to none! This is also because, each disciples\u2019 skill is like a tiger and walking out, no one in all the rivers and lakes dares to provoke them.Though the Sky Tower School has one rule. That\u2019s to fourteen year old disciples, the first three years of their acceptance is considered the testing phase. In these three years, all of the disciples food, clothing, shelter are provided by the outer court. Disciples only need to focus on cultivating. If in these three years you can breakthrough the tempered body, then you are able to enter the inner court to pay respects to your elders and become their students. Of course you don\u2019t need to have a teacher and practise on your own, but the difference in learning by yourself and having a teacher is very large. In a way, the Sky Tower rules do have some flexibility and freedom.In those three years if you don\u2019t break through, then you can either leave the school or be demoted to an experimental disciple.Experimental disciple is Kai Yang\u2019s current status! He is also Sky Tower School\u2019s shame!Compared to normal disciples, their treatment is very different. Experimental disciples must provide for their food, shelter, clothing, for the outer court will no longer waste cultivating resources on these trashes. Once demoted to experimental disciples, you basically can never advance. Unless you manage to increase your cultivation level quickly. Only then will the school let you attempt to become a true disciple.The entire Sky Tower consists of three thousand disciples, while the experimental disciples? You can count them on your ten fingers! Kai Yang has faith that he can become a true disciple!For experimental disciples who want to survive in Sky Tower, is like wanting to reach the heavens. Take Kai Yang for example, the current hut that he is living in was built by him, one log at a time. The holes on the small roof, he doesn\u2019t even have time to fix them. When it rains, the water can\u2019t exit properly and builds up in the room. He buys his own clothes, his food he got himself, he is responsible for all his own needs.Kai Yang\u2019s small hut is in the school\u2019s most remote and most uninhabited location.Generally with such horrendous treatment, it is difficult to endure. That is the reason why the school only has a very small number of these disciples. Most who couldn\u2019t breakthrough the tempered body chose to leave, but Kai Yang stayed.Already been kicked out, how is ok?A few months before, when he was made a experimental disciple, Kai Yang accepted a sweeping job to provide for himself.Right now Kai Yang was both an experimental disciple and the tower\u2019s little sweeping servant. But just by sweeping to maintain a living is hard. There are times when he is cold or hungry, in this life he had chosen this path. Even so, he didn\u2019t play the drums of retreat, because in this this life he had chosen this oath and must continue down it. That was what men did.In Kai Yang there was toughness, if you don\u2019t hit into the brick wall, then don\u2019t look back type of toughness!(TLN: Chinese idiom, to continue on with your own decision/idea/plan)The sky gradually began to light up as he swept. Cleaning the trails, sweeping dust from the space.Even though sweeping itself didn\u2019t use a lot of energy, but without food or drink since the morning and constantly moving, Kai Yang was covered in sweat. This had nothing to do with strength, by his physique was very poor. Two out of three meals he was hungry. For anybody living like him, how could their physique be good.Gradually Sky Tower disciples surrounded him. These disciples had woke up early, not to cultivate but to look at him. They had great interest in Kai Yang, looking at him with avid gazes like they were staring at a naked beauty. A sweet fragrance like juicy meat bins wafted.Among those Tower disciples gathered around Kai Yang, there was also a tense competitive atmosphere in the air. Looking at each other warily, all held an unfriendly look.Someone in the crowd softly said: \u201cSo many people, it\u2019s a bit excessive ah.\u201dIt was that moment they said: \u201cDo you think anybody can walk this path huh. Nobody wants you to stay.\u201dThat statement made the person who spoke embarrassed. For everybody body knew why they were gathered hey, why they were all looking at Kai Yang, all waiting for that moment to come. The deadline was about to arrive, leaving now was not a pity? If you can grab the funds, and today it is also a harvest.The commotion next to him, Kai Yang naturally knew, though his expression never changed. They will parade themselves every five days, six times a month. He has already gotten used to it, nothing to make a fuss out of. He also noticed the amount of people in front of him had decreased, they probably had not all arrived yet.(TIN: Wow, these guys are really bothered to come there six times a month. Don\u2019t they have better things to do?)As he was being discredited, he turned a blind eye to the people next to him and began to sweep.Following the passage of time, the people around Kai Yang gradually increased. There was roughly thirty-forty people present.Kai Yang suddenly stopped and sat down in the middle of the road. Slowly he breathed in the early morning air to restore his own physical stamina.At this movement, the people gathered around him all spread out and surrounded him, with Kai Yang as the centre. A tense atmosphere filled the air, it was as if the air no longer flowed.No one looked at each other pleasingly, but all looked intensely at Kai Yang.If people were to see this crowd, they would hold the misunderstanding that expert was in the middle. Or else, how could so many people surround one person like that? In reality, Kai Yang was only a experimental disciple with a tempered body, third stage. Any of the people present, were stronger than him.\u201cKai Yang, no need to bother. Why don\u2019t you just obediently lie down on the ground so I can beat you and save some time?\u201d Seeing him like this, they really held disdain.How much energy can a tempered body third stage restore? You are going to lose anyway, so why linger?\u201cHear, Hear. Kai Yang, please think about our fellow disciples feelings too. We are not like you, after this game we need to go practise.\u201dThe statement was to let Kai Yang quickly submit and let them beat him. Making the act of restoring his internal energy disrespectful to them. Though he just turned a deaf ear, like Buddha Lao.Time continued to pass by, suddenly the melodious Tower bells sounded. It reached the ears of all the disciples surrounding Kai Yang and himself, startling the disciples. The bells tolled nine times, and from the east the sun rose. It was a new day! Everyone\u2019s breathing calmed down, helplessly looking at Kai Yang as he slowly got up. He took up his broom and glanced at the people encircling him.\u201cChoose me Senior Yang!\u201d Shouted a person. \u201cI strike lightly, I can guarantee you no pain!\u201d\u201cRubbish! Choose me, I will be merciful. I will end it in one fist, and I promise not to waste everyone\u2019s time.\u201d\u201cPick me\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cPick me\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt was very clamorous, just like in a marketplace where vendors were trying to sell their produce and competing on whose produce was fresher.\u201cKai Yang, you can choose your own opponent!\u201d Someone reminded.Kai Yang chuckled, readily he lifted his broom and threw it to the sky. The dozens of pairs of eyes looked up, full of expectation, waited for the broom to fall whilst praying: \u201cchoose me, choose me!\u201d Time seemed to slow down, the broom turned a few times in the air and immediately fell on the ground with a loud boom, no longer moving.The broom head pointed into the crowd to a burly teenager. A regretful sound, the crowd full of resentment and resignation. But that burly youngster laughed out loud and rushed out: \u201cFellow disciples, this brother won this battle today, but hopes fellow disciple do not blame me.\u201d\u201cChe, lucky bastard!\u201d One jealously said.\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t it choose me, for I come every five days, for a month! Kai Yang you aren\u2019t doing this on purpose are you?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, I have already come for a full three months and not once was I chosen!\u201d\u201cBrother, you are more miserable than me.\u201d\u201cNot miserable, not miserable, watching a good good show.\u201d The two brothers looked at each other, smiling secretly to in their hearts.In the courtyard, the others had already dispersed, leaving only Kai Yang and the burly teenager looking at each other.\u201cExperimental disciple Kai Yang, tempered body third stage!\u201d Yang Kai introduced to his opponent.\u201cOrdinary disciple Zhou Ding Jun, tempered body fifth stage!\u201d The burly teenager introduced.Sky Tower disciples were also ranked. From bottom to top are the ordinary disciples, lower base disciples, elite disciples, and core disciple; the five ranks. Zhou Ding Jun said that he was an ordinary disciple, that means he has yet to pay his respects and doesn\u2019t have a mentor. If the breakthrough of the tempered body disciple had a mentor, then their status would be higher than those ordinary lower base disciples. And those elite disciple were selected from the best lower base disciples.As for the core disciples, they were treated as the hope of the next generation of the Sky Tower School and thus cultivated accordingly.The awe-inspiring disciple hierarchy, though it seems unreasonable it can stimulate the younger generation into the fierce sense of competition, which is the foundation of the brutal Tower regime. This is the main reason why Kai Yang fought countless people, another rule of Sky Tower, the Challenge Rule.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 \u2013 Breaking through the wall and not looking backPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the school there was one rule: All Sky Tower disciples were allowed to be challenged once every five days. Though they could at most be three levels higher, or they were allowed to decline. The winner then be able to gain contribution points, while the loser will have points deducted.Contribution Points are also known as Main Gate Contribution Points!In the Sky Tower, contribution points are equivalent to money. If you have enough contribution points, you could exchange them for anything you want, cheats, weapons from the Main Gate Logistics Department. Points can also be exchanged for gold and silver, but generally speaking these contributions were hard-won, and the disciples were generally reluctant to exchange it for that.There were also many different ways to obtain these points. You can exchange them through the treasure hunt, completing tasks, etc.The most common way to earn contribution points was to challenge others! The duels were to test their strength against other disciples, and if they won they earned contribution points.So early in the morning and many people crowded around Kai Yang, it was like staring a ripe persimmon about to fall.Kai Yang\u2019s name, in the school could be considered famous. Not only because he carried the identity of a trial disciple, but also because he was still in Sky Terrace. Also every time someone challenged him, he lost.Kai Yang naturally remembered what it the commotion was, today is the fifth day from the last challenge. They who didn\u2019t challenge him previously, could now. Who isn\u2019t jealous? It was basically free contribution points. Although the points gained were not large, it was still enticing, thus many people still came.In position, Kai Yang shouted out two words, \u201cPlease instruct!\u201dThat being said, anyone knew that Kai Yang was in for another beating!Kai Yang was always the first to attack. Even with his thin body he would always put out an amazing fight, taking the step to Zhou Ding Jun, then punched to the chest. Afterwards a simple and direct attack, then a tiger fist, his attacks were strong and it felt like all of his energy were in his attacks.In the school, all disciples had to learn the Shaolin Fist. This fist was well-known, a basic move to keep disciples in shape and start them off.Zhou Ding Jun didn\u2019t panic, because he was stronger than his opponent by two levels. Sadly, this battle didn\u2019t hold any suspense. Kai Yang\u2019s fist was seen coming and easily dodged by that burly body.Grazing past his clothes, Zhou Ding was unharmed. Punching again, Kai Yang was easily countered and hit in his solar plexus.Suppressing the pain, Kai Yang quickly retreated and avoided Zhou Ding\u2019s third strike.\u201cEh?\u201d This surprised Zhou Ding, he hadn\u2019t thought that his tird stage brother, could actually react fast enough. With this, his future plans were disrupted.But this small error didn\u2019t affect the situation. Thinking quickly, Zhou Ding took to the occasion to catch Kai Yang unaware.Unaware, Kai Yang suddenly kicked his right foot forward. Seeing the shadow rapidly approaching, Zhou Ding saw his indomitable spirit, whilst executing a Shaolin fist.Crap! He heart jumped. Although he had higher cultivation, he was inferior to Kai Yang\u2019s battle experience.But what would it matter? Even if he couldn\u2019t dodge, he would take it head on.Two light chuckles were heard, then Kai Yang fell backwards, while Zhou Ding was still standing. If his opponent was at the same cultivation as him, the he would have been the one to fall down.Others couldn\u2019t see the fists, but they clearly felt it. This disciple was too fast, so in other words he first hit himself then the opponent.But, it was only his fist that was powerful. This body and health were all too frail, skinny arms, legs and body. Malnutrition was very obvious, thus resulting in this ending.\u201cSenior, you let me win!\u201d This battle left quite a bitter result in Zhou Ding Jun\u2019s heart. Although he won, he didn\u2019t feel as if he had won.To the side, many whispers could be heard: \u201cThis person thought he won?\u201d\u201cHa ha. Doesn\u2019t that mean he didn\u2019t know of Kai Yang\u2019s reputation and challenged him? \u201d\u201cThis is really too hilarious.\u201dZhou Ding furrowed his brow, for really didn\u2019t know of Kai Yang\u2019s reputation. He had heard people talking about him. So today when he saw many people crowding around, he had decided to participate too and was super lucky to be chosen.Could you not win? His own fist made him go flying, thus making him at a supreme disadvantage. According to the gate rules, he had already lost.\u201cAgain!\u201d After this thought, Kai Yang yet stood up again and without the slightest hesitation but with even more intense spirit.Without waiting for answer, Kai Yang charged over. Three feet away, he swept his foot towards Zhou Ding\u2019s legs in an attempt to topple him.A leg whip! The school had disciples cultivate various martials arts. Yet Kai Yang\u2019s application of them far surpassed his peers, even though he knew less techniques.So you could use a leg whip here.Then without notice, Kai Yang went flying away again.With two realms apart, also the gap between physical fitness, Kai Yang was once again defeated. His attack to Zhou Ding\u2019s leg had clearly wounded his own bones, making him falter slightly.\u201cAgain!\u201d He said while clenching his teeth and eyes full of determination.\u201cPeng\u2026\u2026.\u201d Kai Yang flew away again.\u201cAgain!\u201d\u201cPeng\u2026\u2026.\u201d Kai Yang flew away again.For those who couldn\u2019t watch any longer had left, while the ones who stayed marvelled: \u201cKai Yang, this guy had real tenacity. No matter how many times he\u2019s beaten down, he just gets back up. He won\u2019t let it go!\u201d(TLN: ~Let it go~! Let it go~o! Sorry had to do that. :P)Hearing these words, Zhou Ding felt real bitter. He hadn\u2019t imagined that his opponent was such a crazy person.So Kai Yang was sent flying another seven or eight times. His face was swollen, eyes were black, staggering around and breathing quite heavily. But he still continued to persist and continue fighting.Finally Zhou Ding exclaimed: \u201cAre you crazy? Throw down the towel or you\u2019ll die!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 \u2013 147 LossesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWithin the Tower disciples\u2019 internal struggles, every year there are many who die. Zhou Ding Jun seeing this unflinching and courageous brother, couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit alarmed.When he thought that, Zhou Ding Jun knew he couldn\u2019t reach such a degree and was afraid that he would have to surrender.Keep your cool, will then you will not be afraid to be burned. This is the way of life, to stubbornly follow your decision. This is perseverance!Despite Kai Yang\u2019s sorry figure, his eyes were becoming more and more powerful. Zhou Ding Jun knew that if he didn\u2019t settle things now, then there will be no end.Thinking of this, Zhou Ding Jun rushed forward to execute a palm knife to Kai Yang\u2019s neck bone. Kai Yang with an imposing manner swiftly escaped. Then his eyes clouded and he fell limply to the ground.Seeing this scene, tens of feet higher, a disciple who was sitting on a tree branch took out a small book. Flipping the page she wrote: Trial Disciple Kai Yang vs. Ordinary Disciple Zhou Ding Jun, Zhou Ding Jun wins.(TLN: Experimental disciple will now become trial disciple)The person who was on the tree branch had a graceful figure, it obviously was a woman. It was just that black mask on her face, didn\u2019t allow people to see her face. But those delicate eyebrows, proved that this person was not old. The armband on her arm also indicated her identity, a Sky Tower Dark Hall Disciple!Sky Tower\u2019s Dark Hall is a special sector; the school\u2019s three main elders were responsible for governing and the hall disciples were responsible for to recording down all affairs of the school, no matter how big or small, all matters are recorded. This also included the results of duels between disciples.So for all battles within the school, you do not have to worry about not being able to prove your wins and earning contribution points. For in the shadows, dark hall disciples will record them down for you, and summarise your monthly records.This woman, after recording the outcome for this duel, took out another smaller book from her waist and opened up at May 7th century, 14 years Kai Yang\u2019s 147th defeat.Even if you remove this, above are numerous records of Kai Yang\u2019s battles. From the first battle to the most recent, all had one word: Defeat!One hundred and forty seven battles in a row, he had lost every single one of them. This simply can be said that since the school\u2019s history, it was a unique record and was enough to be awe-inspiring. Though the owner of this record was lying on the ground, not knowing if they were dead or alive.Kai Yang had never challenged others, so these 147 losses were from others challenging him. So to say, from being challenged once every five day, this had last for two years.Looking at Kai Yang on the ground, she wrinkled her eyebrows. She didn\u2019t understand how Yang kai could endure to this state. He had already become the Tower\u2019s trial disciple, even his very survival was endangered, so why did he still linger? If he had left, then his life will certainly be better. This thin boy, what kind of dedication did he have? Even with 147 straight losses, he remains undaunted.Perhaps this is a man\u2019s folly? Taking notice of Kai Yang was also a moment\u2019s coincidence. When Xia Ning Chang became a dark hall disciple, she was placed in charge of monitoring this area. Yang Kai was challenged every time, not once, not twice, and every single time she saw him being beaten to near death. Xia Ning Chang, began to pay attention to this tempered body third stage youth.She was really curious, with his strength, how long could he endure before finally leaving Sky Tower. This type of talent, this type of training speed, he really was not fit to remain here. The ordinary world is his place.The people below had already long scattered, only Kai Yang was still there on the ground. Coming and going, time passed by.Xia Ning Chang, disappeared from the branch in a flash.When Kai Yang woke up, it was already three o\u2019clock. There was nowhere on his body that didn\u2019t hurt. Staggering, he stood up and looked up, only to be surprised. For the place in which he woke up from was under the shade of a tree and not where he fainted.This was really surprising, was there a fellow disciple that was kind enough to carry him over? This had never happened before, causing Kai Yang to furrow his brows. He could vaguely remember there was a shadowy figure darting in front of him. But memory was too vague, thinking harder just made it more unclear.But between his current position and the place he fainted, there was very distinct drag marks, clearly showing that he had been dragged over.Once again he felt his back, immediately flaring hot pain spread out.Kai Yang froze for a moment, becoming furious! The trace of goodwill he felt towards his benefactor had quickly disappeared. That person directly dragged him over, otherwise how could his back bled like this.He might as just have left him there on the ground! Kai Yang thought to himself.Being depressed, Kai Yang realised that in his right hand he was clutching something. Looking down in doubt, he was surprised to find a small, fine work of porcelain in his hand.What is this? This was definitely not his, for the only things that Kai Yang owned were the clothes on his back and his broom. How could he have this?The small porcelain bottle had a label. Yang Kau read it out: \u201cBlood Clotting Cream\u201d.Blood clotting cream, Kai Yang knew of this.This was the school\u2019s cream to help heal wounds, although it was ordinary, its effects were very good. Generally, disciples will carry one bottle around for emergency uses. this one bottle of cream in Sky Tower Logistics,was very expensive.Ten points of contribution was the bottle\u2019s cost!How much contribution points can Kai Yang earn for sweeping for a month? He can only earn ten points, in other words, this one bottle\u2019s worth was equal to one month of work for him.Who was it? At this moment, the resentment Kai Yang had towards this person was reduced greatly, but as he moved, the pain flared up again. He had already come to this Tower for three years, three years. Within this time, Yang Kai had already gotten used to the lack of compassion between disciples. But today, for this person to leave behind a bottle of blood clotting cream for him, greatly touched Yang Kai\u2019s hearts.Originally, he had thought all the disciples were cold-blooded people.Perhaps this bottle of cream was not worth much to them, but to Kai Yang currently, he desperately needed it.There was a saying, dripping water is grace, is hard to forget even when one\u2019s teeth fall out!(TLN: Meaning one small kindness must be remembered eternally and returned)Kai Yang was both grateful and tried to remember who it was. It was becoming harder to remember. He could could only recall the thin strand of fragrance lingering around.\u201cWas this medicine this fragrant?\u201d Kai Yang pondered.Calming down and straightening his clothes, he carefully put the bottle away. Kai Yang re-picked up his broom and commenced his work.Inside and outside all were swept, then at midnight, his work was considered completed. Kai Yang dragged his tired and hungry body back to his hut.The morning\u2019s battle wounds had yet to be treated. Even when Kai Yang was starving, he could only endure. First treat the injuries then deal with the hunger.Taking off his clothes, he then carried over a tub of water to wash his body. If someone were to be by his side and look at Kai Yang\u2019s body, they would cry out in shock.Kai Yang\u2019s bones, along with his ribs were all clearly visible. It was clear that his body didn\u2019t have much flesh on it and lacked nutrition. There were also bruises and scars littering his body everywhere. There was practically no place that wasn\u2019t scarred.Every five days he was challenged, every time he lost, every time he was knocked unconscious. When old injuries had yet to fade, new ones were added. Switching to any other person, they would be unable to tolerate this pain, but Kai Yang did. Not only did he bear with it, but he continued his daily sweeping, not letting those injuries affect him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 \u2013 The Black BookPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOnce his body was clean, Kai Yang picked up the bottle of blood clotting cream and sniffed it a little. He found that the medicine was quite refreshing and lost himself in it and then he shook his to clear it.Kai Yang opened that bottle, and tried to smear the cream directly onto his injuries but stopped. He hastily went to fetch a new tub of water and then put some of the medicine into the water to dilute it. Stirring carefully, he began his treatment using the diluted formula.(TLN: Ah, the life of a poor person. Too relatable\u2026T_T)Enough the effects of the blood clotting cream were good, after diluting it, the effects were also reduced. But Kai Yang only had this one bottle, so naturally he would have to use it sparingly.After the tub of diluted was used up, Kai Yang had also finished treating his injuries. However, it also left him some doubts. For the paste\u2019s smell was not the same as it was previously and also slightly spicy.Putting his clothes back on, he went to get the dark coloured sweet potato and wolfed it down. Kai Yang then plonked down on his bed, and soon fell asleep.The holes in the small roof, allowed some light to seep in, lighting up the hut. The hut was extremely sparse, there was no table or chairs. Only one small bed with a deerskin blanket and square shaped pillow. This was all of Kai Yang\u2019s possessions.The deerskin, was from a deer Kai Yang hunted previously. Although it was not thick, it was still warm. While his pillow was from his time outside the school when he was hunting, he happened to pick up.Pillow was a square, a foot long and three fingers thick. It looked like stone, felt like one but didn\u2019t bear the weight a stone should. Kai Yang didn\u2019t know what it was, but used it as a pillow, and didn\u2019t investigate further.This blackstone pillow had already been with Kai Yang for a year already, yet he still didn\u2019t know what it was. Nonetheless, it was a great pillow.Fast asleep, Kai Yang dreamt of today\u2019s battle. Time and time again he was hit flying away by Zhou Ding Jun. And time and time again he would stand back up, persevering and continuing with a blood crest on his chest.As the dream continues the blood crest became more and more powerful. Kai Yang\u2019s sleeping face was clench up in pain, but you could see it was resolute. He only had one goal in his heart; to succeed. Even if he was ordered to cut off his foot or fry his body in flames, he would not cower in fear.The unconscious Kai Yang didn\u2019t take notice that the pillow below his had started to exclude a clouded light that corresponded with his moods. This light became more and more luminous.In the dream, Kai Yang continued with his early morning encounter with Zhou Ding Jun; repeatedly getting knocked to the ground. At his thousandth time of getting knocked and getting back up, with his unwavering will suddenly broke through. He rushed mercilessly towards Zhou Ding Jun, who immediately fell to the ground. Zhou Ding Jun\u2019s figure then became hazy and morphed into his own figure.At this moment Kai Yang\u2019s mind calmed down, though it wasn\u2019t due to him beating his opponent, but he winning against himself. Winning against his inner fear and yielding heart.A faint feeling gradually rose up, there is no longer anything under the sky that can make him submit to them.In reality, the black pillow under Kai Yang\u2019s head suddenly burst forth a black ray. This black ray emerged from the black stone and hovered in the air for a bit before drilling into Yang Kai\u2019s head. Instantly disappearing from sight.At the same time, in an ancient and desolate place a strange presence descended. Like tidal waves, the collapse of snow, any person in front of him was insignificant that strange presence thought.Kai Yang suddenly opened his eyes, his whole body sweating and bursting with fear.He was awoken by that strange presence.Calming himself, he forced a smile. When was dreaming, he could actually scare himself like that, it\u2019s ridiculous. Rubbing his face, he looked up into the night sky to determine the time, and was annoyed. He had only slept for two hours, seeing it was quite dark outside.Hurriedly he got up, folded up the deerskin blanket and re-positioned the blackstone pillow. As he got up, he frowned and turned to look back at the pillow.This feeling\u2026\u2026his gut told him that it was not the same.Under doubts, Kai Yang reached out towards the pillow and picked it up. He was correct, its weight had decreased a lot.Strange, how can this block stone, suddenly become so light? Questioning this, more questions started to appear.It was like a thick book was being thrown into the air, with the pages spread out as it landed. Kai Yang was flabbergasted, momentarily forgetting to catch it.Pa, the blackstone pillow fell to the ground and opened up like a book. He couldn\u2019t believe it, even though it was spread out in front of him.Wasn\u2019t this a stone? How could it suddenly turn into a book?The Blackstone pillow had been with Kai Yang for over a year already, he was very clear. Did he not previously find a blackstone and not a book? Did an old turtle take off his shell and become a snake?A while ago when he stooped down to pick up the book, and he immediately felt a connection with it.Looking at it again, he really had to admit it was the pillow he was using. This thick book, left him speechless, though there were no words. It was empty. But the books pages couldn\u2019t let him see through it. He gently tried to tear a page, but he couldn\u2019t tear it at all.It really makes him rethink. He had owned it for an entire year, and only just discovered its true colours.But such an empty black book, what is its use? He inspected the book all over, and still nothing.Mysterious. Kai Yang turned to the first page, and nothing. Staring at the blank book page.With little effort, he still found little change to the page. Then he discovered there was a little change to the page. The strange presence that appeared in the desolate place of his dreamed had appeared again. A line of golden coloured characters had started to appear.\u201cBlood is cited, the golden body descends, not a miracle, but a golden immortal!\u201dThis penetrated deep into the soul, which caused Kai Yang to slam the book shut, with his limbs shaking uncontrollably. Breathing deeply, he managed to calm his heart down a bit.What secrets did this black book hide? He didn\u2019t know at all, but he knew that this object he obtained from Black Wind Mountains contains great history.After a long period of silence, he once again opened the black book. This time, he read the first line on the page.Turns out\u2026\u2026\u2026it wasn\u2019t a dream.Gradually, other lines slowly appeared.\u201cProud golden body, rules the fence, indomitable spirit, will it descend!\u201dEight lines and thirty-two words occupied an entire page. Giving one a dominating heavenly and earthly feeling, as if those words were imbued with domineering spirit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 \u2013 The Proud Golden StatuePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThese thirty-two words\u2019 meanings were very easy to understand. Naturally Kai Yang understood.But the black book\u2019s history was unclear, thus he was a bit afraid. What if this was a trap of some sort? Thinking of this he laughed at himself, for currently he was only a trials disciple of Sky Tower\u2019s. Who would go to the effort of taking care of him?From just looking at the last couple of lines and their meaning, the reason why the blackstone pillow will turn into a black book was probably because of his dream tonight.For over one year, the pillow didn\u2019t change, then suddenly after that dream it turned into a book. They must be connected.Is it because of his own change that also changed the blackstone pillow.Since it was I who led to the book\u2019s birth, then this black book was born for me! Thus, I am this black book\u2019s owner!Thinking of this, Kai Yang hesitated no more. The writing clearly on the book clearly states that he must drip blood in order to lead. Thinking of this, he bit onto his finger hardly and dripped a drop of blood on to the page.Drip, drip. The blood went onto the page, but there was no apparent change. After a fair amount of time passed, from the page, black light started to emerge. His body immediately felt unwell, for the injuries from earlier today had started to sear in pain. His head had also started to hurt.Biting down on his teeth, he continued to endure. His blood continued to flow, and the light on the book was becoming brighter and brighter.After a large amount of time and effort, Kai Yang nearly fainted. But there had been substantial change to the book, and the black light had started to wiggle and contract. And from the center of the page, a tiny vortex had appeared.Following that, from within the vortex a golden swirl could be seen. Kai Yang put great effort to maintain a clear mind, staring intently to the transformation in front of him.Within the black vortex, a small, round, shiny, black object gradually came out.He was shocked, for there really was something in the the book. Even though while he was dripping his blood, he had some expectations, he didn\u2019t think that is was actually true.But right now, right in front of him, the thirty-words from before were not false.Blood is cited, the golden body descends!So, what kind of golden body is it? Anticipation covered his pale face.After a while, after the shiny, round thing had fully appeared in front of him, he couldn\u2019t help but swallow a mouthful of saliva. How matter how rich his imagination was, he wouldn\u2019t have thought that the golden body would be like this.This thing was about 30 cm high golden skeleton, and to think the first thing that came out was this skeleton\u2019s skull. The golden skull just floated on top of the book page, sitting crossed legged like it was mediating. Every bone lighting up Kai Yang\u2019s tiny hut.The black vortex on the page slowly began to recede and everything reverted back to its tranquil state.Kai Yang had watched this strange golden skull appeared, for a time did not know how to react. On page said only how to get the golden body out, but didn\u2019t say what to do after it came out.Looking at it, he thought there wasn\u2019t something right. The golden skeleton in front of him had no eyes, but he felt like it looked like his own. It obviously didn\u2019t have any mouth but was clearly mocking its weakness.Thinking of this, Kai Yang was furious and went to pick it up.This small, insignificant skeleton dares to be arrogant!He didn\u2019t think that when he went to reach out for it, the golden skeleton flew out towards him. Flying past his hand and embedded himself on his chest.This was a bit of a horror. With a skeleton smashing onto his chest, he cried out and then the skeleton started to emit a fluorescent light, and penetrated deep into the pores of Kai Yang\u2019s limbs.Suddenly, pain exploded all over his body, but the pain was not an ordinary pain, but the pain from the depths of the bone! He breathed in painfully, fell to the ground, his body bent like shrimp, with waves of cramps.His whole body\u2019s bones shattered in that moment, and he couldn\u2019t even lift a finger, for he had no strength. This was not an illusion, if you could see into his body, then you can see his bones being crushed, and next to each crushed bone, there was a layer of gold wrapped around. Continuously repairing the broken bones, but far slower than the damage speed. When the repair was finished, it was crushed again.Human bones wrap around bone marrow and bone marrow nerve. Any small touch to them can bring great harm. One can only imagine his suffering at that moment.In his body, not a single bone wasn\u2019t shattered.Even for others, even if their strength of thousands of times higher than his, they would have probably fainted now. But with Kai Yang, he could only feel the pain a thousand fold right now.Tragic cry came from the hut, not far away a fellow disciple was out for a walk was frightened by the cry and quickly ran away.Form somewhere, he received a message that came from this golden body: Destroy Kai Yang\u2019s consciousness, and seize his body!Did Kai Yang agree? Even if he was unable to move, but also struggled to maintain the awareness, he will never let golden body take over the magpie nest. The golden body felt fear, so over and over again crushed Yang Kai\u2019s bones, tortured his nerves, so that he fainted thereon.One is a proud golden statue, another with an indomitable spirit, who wins who loses, one cannot see the outcome.Kai Yang knew that right now it was really important, unlike the previous challenges with his fellow disciples. If this was the past him, then he would have given up but now he will not. Even if it hurts like hell will endure.His consciousness, the golden body\u2019s destructive power, both commenced a hard tug of war. And the battlefield is the Kai Yang\u2019s body, you pull, I pull, each not letting an inch go.Over time, Kai Yang was surprised to find that the intolerable pain was slowly reducing, help lift his spirits and fill him full of energy.It\u2019s no wonder, after Kai Yang and the golden body clashed time and time again, the numerous crushing of his bones had strengthened them. With his bones becoming stronger and stronger, and the golden body\u2019s powers becoming weaker and weaker, the pain thus naturally alleviated. The struggle will soon end.With the scales tipping in his favor, the unbearable pain slowly became bearable. Transforming into light tickles, then becoming like splashes of cold water. This feeling was like applying cream, allowing his millions of pores to open and relax.Aware of the golden body\u2019s desperate struggle, made Kai Yang furious. Cursing loudly, he crushed that presence within him.Inside his body, it had finally calmed down.A sigh could be heard, a sigh full of comfort and trace of great relief.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6 \u2013 BMWs are a good ride and beauties go to heroesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHe after quietly lying on the ground for more than an hour, Kai Yang stood up, for he had just used up all his strength.An hour before, Kai Yang felt it was like a dream. He really could not believe this was true.Quietly he punched himself and felt the pain.\u201cIn the end what it is, what history does this black book have?\u201d He muttered to himself in helplessness.Waiting until his heart stopped beating, he suddenly found himself somewhat different from before. For he couldn\u2019t eat three, fulfilling meals a day, and every five days he would suffer beatings. Thus his body bones are weak, but now he clearly perceived that his bones were full of vitality. A surge of energy, filled with warmth, slowly circulated inside and outside, his body.Moving slightly, the bones burst out a crystal-clear sound. Making it seem like a melody being played. And he who was hurt today, couldn\u2019t feel the pain anymore.Aware of this, Kai Yang quickly roll up his sleeves, and opened his clothes. Looking closely, he found that his body no longer had any bruises and injuries. They had actually all disappear, even those old wounds were healed.Feeling as unblemished as a newborn baby!Rubbing the places that previously held wounds, dead skin fell. This revealed the new tender skin underneath, like a baby\u2019s but far more healthier.\u201cI cry \u2026\u2026\u201d He swallowed down a cold lump, thinking of that golden skeleton in his body had such a strong recovery ability!Then feeling his own strength and found that he was still at the tempered body third stage with no change. This discovery somewhat made him a little disappointed.Rivers and allusions, with secrets known only to insiders, this type of story Kai Yang heard much during his childhood. He knew in world there are many men eligible to jump past the dragon gate, becoming powerful and famous.But after all it\u2019s just a story. How many people can really be happy and gain such luck and results in this world? Those senior experts with greater strength, the more I could not bear to lower themselves with earth and buried. Always finding inheritor before death. I want to jump off a cliff drill a cave and encounter events, such unlikely things will happen?But the current problem had happened to him. That black must have great background, and that old golden skeleton must be extraordinary.This can be said as his good fortune. It could also be said as fate.The four sentences on the black book\u2019s first page: Proud golden body, rules the fence, indomitable spirit, will it descend!If he didn\u2019t pick up the black book, but another picked it up, they too will treat it was garbage. Unable to prise open like Mt. Tai. Precisely because he picked it up, and used it as a pillow for a year, it felt his body\u2019s unyielding and tough nature. Unlocking the of the secret black book today.In other words, this thing really is his first encounter, but it\u2019s the first achievement that he obtained through his own hands. Thought of this, Kai Yang sudden burst comfortable, is called the BMW with a good saddle, beauty gifts hero\u2026\u2026\u201cThat black book.\u201d Thinking of it suddenly, this book that was his pillow for over year. He wasn\u2019t anxious to find out what it was nor how he found it.Between being anxious, and somewhat weakened in the body, the black book abruptly appeared in front of Kai Yang, and snapped shut, falling to the ground.He was stunned. Picking up the book, he furrowed his eyebrows while thinking hard. Struck by with an idea, a move from his hands the book disappeared. And a further move, made it appear again.This scene was like a magic trick. One could see that Kai Yang\u2019s face was very solemn, because he truly felt, that the black book could escape into his body with a single thought.\u201cThis black book possibly\u2026\u2026be made from a soulstone!\u201d After saying it, he nearly gave himself a fright.A soulstone! This was considered a legendary gem.Only when hundreds of millions of ghost gather in the abyss and with the help of vast amounts of human vitality, will it start to form.Rumor has it, that this is how is was formed.Inside the blackstone, with misery of a hundred million lives, the living cannot enter, and green grass can\u2019t think to grow!Those words were somewhat exaggerated. But for a soulstone about 3.5cm x 3.5 cm to form, how many lives must be taken? The formation of this mythical rock was really cruel and bloody. What every life near it during its creation, will be dead within milliseconds.Also the formation time is unimaginable, it could that up to a millennium or even ten millenniums.Putting the formation process aside, this soulstone can be considered a supreme treasure. That is because it has a very unique ability, for it can be melded with one\u2019s body and also open up a dimension. This space is quite flexible, storing things will be no hassle.Even though Kai Yang is only a trial disciple, a humble position, his experiences were not lacking. Not to mention, the story of the legendary soulstone has been around more many years, anyone would know the story.When he just obtained this black book, he didn\u2019t think about this. Thinking about how the books went into his body, he thought about how the golden skeleton came out from the book. How could he not recognise the book\u2019s material?He immediately started sweating.Soulstones were the things of legends, long extinct in the world. He didn\u2019t think that he will be able to encounter one, let alone such a large one!The legends only talked about 3.5cm x 3.5 cm sized soulstones, for it was only found that large. Even at that size, it was priceless. But the only in front of him, was somehow made into a black book, that was 30 x 7 cm!It\u2019s value\u2026\u2026was immeasurable!If this news were to spread out, even if it\u2019s the entire Han Dynasty, not mention a mere martial school, they will probably be crushed overnight to obtain it.Kai Yang couldn\u2019t help but feel his hands heat up. This heart had not forgotten the terror, but luckily it could be taken into his body. Otherwise he would be in great danger.His body hiding this treasure, he swiftly escaped back into his hut. He dared not to be carelessly, while his heart beated madly.He was becoming more and more excited, whilst also becoming more and more uneasy.HIs strength was currently too low, so how could he guard this treasure? Even though the black book could be taken into his body, eliminating chances of being discovered. This didn\u2019t lessen the worry in his heart.Only practise, only the strong will be able to protect what is theirs! Thinking about what happened three years ago, Kai Yang\u2019s eyes gradually calmed down.All on his, without any support he came to this school. What is not for practise and strength?Even though he obtained this book, he took it into his hands. On the first page was the proud Golden Body. Even though he didn\u2019t know what use it had, it couldn\u2019t be useless. This book also had so many pages, it couldn\u2019t only possess this one Golden Body?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 \u2013 Breaking through stages, is like being rebornPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAlthough Kai Yang is only fifteen this year, due to his experiences these past three years, he is far more mature than his peers. It is also because of this, that he forged this unyielding character.So when he calmed down, sitting on his bed he carefully started to read the first page.After confirming there were no extra things popping out of the first page, he started to read the second page.With his previous experiences, his actions seemed more natural and knowledgeable. And then Kai Yang\u2019s eyes slowly widened as golden words emerged on the dark pages\u201cProud Golden Body: Tempered Body Record!\u201dPreviously his mood had dropped but now it soared. Sure enough, as he suspected, every page had something hiddenAlmost without thinking, Kai Yang\u2019s entire mind was focused on the second page of the book.Abruptly, the golden characters flew off the pages like a fish and swiftly drilled themselves in Kai Yang\u2019s brain. The glow enveloped the darkness around him and then disappeared. After it was gone, he felt as if his brain had gained new information. This had all come from the golden characters.Calming his heart, Kai Yang closed his eyes and began to digest the information.In fact, he didn\u2019t need to digest and absorb the information. For when the characters imprinted themselves into his brain, he was already able to comprehend their meaning with ease. A full mastery in another sense.\u201cThis is the tempered body record.\u201d Yang Kai muttered, for he found that it was a fist technique.Though it may seem simple, in reality it was not. In order to perform it, there were strict requirements. For it is extremely profound. In order to cultivate it, you must be facing the rising sun, in the east, to learn it.So at most, you could only practise for half an hour a day.Currently it was night, so he had to wait at least five-six hours to start. This frustrated Kai Yang, for he had exerted himself all day and only ate one measly sweet potato. Nonetheless, he had obtained a priceless treasure, and was jubilant.Aftering trying to sleep for half an hour, he decided to analyse the third page of the black book.But it just let him down, no matter how much he checked and flipped, there were no changes to the page. While doing this, he fell asleep.When Yang Kai then woke up, it was nearly sunrise. The pre-dawn darkness was clouded and stillness covered the whole area, with the occasional insect and bird noises.With his heart looking forward to what was going to happen, Kai Yang quickly leapt out of bed, and went to the front of the cabin. Standing there, he took a few deep breaths and let his body slowly relax.Oriental? A touch of gray dawn appeared, then he opened his eyes. The set of instructions on the fist technique was practised countless, hundreds of times.His hands shaped into a palm. With a gentle, slow movement, pushing to the left, to the right, pushing forward. Embracing the world in his mind, everything in between the palm, the vast land, even the air covering the moon and stars.Left foot forward, right next to the horizon, the right foot stepped powerfully like the king of the underworld. Between breaths, the world full was full of vitality, like spring flowers blooming.The autumn wind blew, like a golden message. Then the cold wind whistled by, signalling the coming of snow, ice, cold snow.Yang Kai\u2019s look gradually deepened, slowly his fists pressed on the hefty rocks. In any case, the rock didn\u2019t hint at opening any time soon.With a burst of sound, Kai Yang with a pale face, suddenly staggered, nearly fell to his knees.While exercising countless times in his mind, he discovered that this art was an absolute fist. Kai Yang never expected this record actually contained such mysterious quenching body technique.For just that short while, Kai Yang felt that the entire world was weighing on his shoulders. But he also felt that he could sense all things in the world, under this pressure.This quenching body record, was not the practise of fist techniques. It was the practise of worldly transformation and the fate of the world. This practice was full of ups and downs, joys and sorrows. A slow punch and kick in, could affect the power of heaven and earth, but also was full of secret rules.When he launched a six palms, it took three steps. This result wasn\u2019t even one percent of the result recorded in the book. Just that, had been difficult to sustain. Then a crack emitted from his spine, making him believe that he broke his spine.He Quickly inspected it, but only found that his back was in some pain. It wasn\u2019t anything big.Steeling his mind, Kai Yang once again started to practise according to the tempered body record.Because he wasn\u2019t psychologically prepared, Kai Yang\u2018s mind was in a trance. Feeling unclear, he held his breath to regain a clear mind. Accompanied by a slow dance of his fists, Kai Yang once again felt his mind had become clear and regained the atmosphere required to continue.Then his body emitted several indistinct feelings, Kai Yang was uncertain as to what they were. Not only that, with the routine deployment, his fist was actually heavier, like being at the bottom of the ocean. With more hardships, there were more improvements.Kaka sounds could be heard. Kai Yang\u2019s every action, made his bones explode like firecrackers. Excruciating pain permeated throughout his body, but he was unmoved. His tenacity at this moment vividly appeared.In the blink of an eye, Kai Yang felt his hands and feet tremble like they were beaten to pulp. It was like heaven and earth both imposed themselves on his body.Persisting, he didn\u2019t falter.Suddenly a warmth surged, alleviating the pain within his body in this moment. Spirits lifted, he restarted practise. He knew that this must have been due to the integration of the golden skeleton. After all, both of these things came from the same place.In front the sun rising, near a cabin in a remote place of the school stood a sweating young man. Diligently practising, slow fists and discovering his future.Half an hour passed when Kai Yang suddenly felt light. He no longer felt the heavy pressure on his body. Right at this moment, he could no longer continuing cultivating this skill.The record was very clear, you could only cultivate for half an hour everyday at sunrise.His effort seemed to have drained him. Thus Kai Yang fell to the ground in a heap and took a deep breath. A surge of purple gas accompanied his breath and disappeared. In an instant, he felt refreshed and energised.Looking distracted, he couldn\u2019t help but but be shocked.Atmosphere sense! He had already developed a sense to the atmosphere. That is to say, he had broken through the tempered body third stage and was entering the fourth stage?This news made him elated. Since entering Sky Tower, it took three years of practicing to reach the third stage. But after thirty minutes of practising, the mysterious quenching body technique had let him break through and enter the fourth stage.The tempered body had nine stages. Until the third stage, it really just enhanced one\u2019s physical capabilities. But after the fourth stage, it would generate a presence within the meridians.Only with the birth of atmosphere sense, are you considered a true cultivator.Although at this time you will have the atmosphere sense, the body will still have no real strength. You could only wait for the seventh stage, where the body will develop its own strength, all the way until the ninth stage. That is when the body breaks through and opens / creates a door to strength to the Kai Yuan Boundary. Only then will you truly have strength.Kai Yuan Boundary, is a true warrior\u2019s start.Everything in the tempered body territory, was laying the foundations for the future of the Kai Yuan Boundary . This foundation was not finalized, like with a man\u2019s strength. For your bones, skin would grow continuously, until you reach the peak.Kai Yang had just having entered the fourth stage, and obtained atmosphere sense. To outsiders, this may not seem like much, but to him it was great news and progress.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 \u2013 A beautiful thin waistPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHalf an hour after he broke through, the results of quenching body record were evident. Although his own knowledge contributed, if not for that technique, he believed that he needed another three-four months before advancing.With this, he breathed in deeply and exhaled out the impurities in his body.From within his mouth, out came a pitch-black smoke. Filthy, as it tumbled to the ground. After expectorating this smoke out, his six senses all became more acute and sharpened.(TLN: He\u2019s been possessed by a demon! [Supernatural style] Senses: Sound, touch, sight, taste, smell and sixth sense [instinct])Was this his body\u2019s impurity? Kai Yang shook on the spot.With the practise of cultivation you will reduce and drain the body of impurities each time. Kai Yang previously had experienced this, but never at this level.Numerous ideas and joy lingered in his mind. Although he had successfully entered the fourth layer, he had made no real progress in the tempered body record\u2019s fist technique. His daily practise could only produce one percent of the total result, out of the 101 punches.Hasty men don\u2019t eat hot tofu and with a hasty heart, you won\u2019t be able to feel a hot butt.(TLN: Saying that have patience and results will come, if you rush you will miss things.)Thinking for awhile, Kai Yang planned a bit of his future. Even though it wasn\u2019t thorough, he could no longer be like how he had been, taking each step as it came. For after awhile, you couldn\u2019t help but become impatient.Then after eating something he continued to sweep the area.Although he was a sweeper, it didn\u2019t mean that he needed to sweep the entire school. He was only responsible for one tenth of the school. Even though it was cumbersome, it would only take an hour or so.Within the trees, Xia Ning Chang had started to monitor the disciples and inadvertently saw Kai Yang sweeping away. To not have some emotions would be weird. Today, there was something different about him, but she wasn\u2019t sure. For over half an hour, he hadn\u2019t left that spot, sweeping it until it was shiny and spotless. It was so slick that if a mosquito were to go on, it would have a sprained ankle.(TLN: Trying to express how clean it is. This author has a major issue with mosquitos I say.)This guy\u2026\u2026..Xia Ning Chang didn\u2019t know what to do with him.At that moment, Kai Yang was thinking about other things. Yesterday he had obtained a huge opportunity, so naturally he was considering his future. But no real options were found. He could only continue to practise at sunrise everyday, for now.While he was pondering, rapid footsteps approached quickly from behind. He quickly went to dodge, but didn\u2019t realise that the other party was making preparations to avoid him too. So they crashed into each other.Though he didn\u2019t sustain any major injuries, when he crashed into that person, it felt as if he had crashed into a steel wall. With a cry, he fell to the ground and the place he bumped felt numb.Kai Yang quickly recovered and apologetically asked: \u201cThis fellow disciple, are you okay?\u201dThe young man was annoyed and when he looked up to see that it was Kai Yang, that explosive anger dissipated. Holding anger for such person held no meaning and it was also his own fault.Replying immediately while waving his hands: \u201cIt\u2019s alright, it\u2019s alright!\u201dWhile saying this and getting up, he then energetically ran away.Kai Yang asked: \u201cFellow disciple, where are you going to hurriedly?\u201dThe young man faintly shouted: \u201cThe Contribution Hall, where else?\u201dListening to his words, Kai Yang realised that today was already the eighth day of the month. It was the day where the main gate distributed last month\u2019s contribution points!So every month of this day, the Logistics Department would be crowded with disciples flocking to collect their points. With these points they could exchange them for various cultivation pills, treasures and martial arts to improve their strength. So this day made all disciples all excited.Some were excited, while others disappointed. Kai Yang was of the latter.Startled, he couldn\u2019t help but frown. Each month, the amount of points he received was quite meager.Sweepers could earn ten points, but in the last month he was challenged six times, and each time he lost! With reductions after each loss, he was only left with four points.This\u2026\u2026this really made people cry.Fortunately he was only a trial disciple. His status was the lowest, so if he lost, he would only lose one point. Normal disciples lost two!Thinking of this, Kai Yang was thankful.But even a small mosquito has flesh. And with his savings, he will one day earn enough to exchange them for something worthwhile.(TLN: Again, what does the author have with mosquitos?)There had been enough delay today he thought as he continued to sweep.When he had finally finished the job, it was noon. Time to go to the hall to collect his points.After the morning\u2019s bustle, the hall was now deserted and quiet. Thankfully he hadn\u2019t came in the morning, or the wait would have been too troublesome.Waltzing into the hall, you could clearly see an old man dozing away.This old man was the treasurer of the school. He was about fifty with thin white hair and a kind face. Looking at him, he looked harmless to animals and humans, but Kai Yang knew he was a sly fox!There was once an elite disciple who dared to act arrogant here and was then pushed out of the hall a few hundred feet. His life was almost taken. Kai Yang was present, so he knew this and also knew that his old man held unfathomable strength.Stepping into the view of the old man, Kai Yang could clearly see the old man snoring away.This old thing! Don\u2019t know which female Sky Tower disciple he is dreaming about again!(ED: Doesn\u2019t even give the old guy the benefit of the doubt O.o)Holding a broom, he gently nudged the old man while softly calling: \u201cTreasurer Meng!\u201dThe old man\u2019s surname was Meng, his first name Kai Yang didn\u2019t know so he couldn\u2019t call him that.Tapping the counter a few times, the old man was finally awoken. He groggily opened up his eyes and saw that it was Kai Yang. Wrinkling his face as if he saw s**t.(TLN: For young viewers, just in case.)\u201cWhat\u2019s with that face?\u201d Kai Yang asked indignantly.Rolling his eyes: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come in the morning?\u201dConfidently he replied: \u201cThere were too many people in the morning, and currently it\u2019s peaceful!\u201d\u201cInterrupting this old man\u2019s rest. Do you know what respecting the elderly means?\u201dLeaning in, Kai Yang whispered: \u201cWhich young lady did you dream of?\u201dSuddenly full of energy Treasurer Meng replied to Kai Yang with eyes full of contempt and loudly proclaimed: \u201cYour words just now, tarnished this old man\u2019s reputation! Too outrageous.\u201d\u201cGood body figure?\u201d\u201cGreat!\u201d Treasurer Meng unconsciously leaked out.(ED: GG I had high hopes but alas they were shattered.)\u201cSupple legs, white skin and a beautiful, thin waist?\u201d\u201cEn, en, en\u2026\u2026.\u201d Immediately he nodded his head, immediately thinking Kai Yang as a friend.\u201cHe, he\u2026\u2026\u201d Kai Yang sneered.Treasurer Meng stammered and blushed as bright as a monkey\u2019s ass. Full of shame, he just wanted to dig a hole and crawl inside to hide.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 \u2013 Treasurer MengPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThroughout his years at Sky Tower, the only person Kai Yang really knew was Treasurer Meng. After all, he needed to go to him every month.Treasurer Meng had a nickname which most people referred to him as, Bully Meng. Even though his position is a treasurer, he still liked to extort contribution points from other disciples.Take blood clotting cream for example, usually it would be sold around ten contribution points. He will sell two bottles for the price of three. Also the amount of cream that should go in two bottles, was put into three. It\u2019s very simple he said, buy it or get lost!Of course Treasurer Meng doesn\u2019t always do it, only occasionally. He only targets richer disciples, for poor people like Kai Yang he doesn\u2019t even bother.Contribution points are hard to come by, so how can disciples stand by and be exploited? Every disciple that had been cheated by him would report him to the council. They have warned him numerous times, but he still continued, unmoved. Furthermore, his position is crucial, and there was no one who could replace him.Due to this, all of the school\u2019s disciples hated him to the utmost limit.That old man was ruthless to everybody, except Kai Yang, to whom he could do nothing. That was because one time, he was peeking at a female disciple, and was caught red-handed by him.No respect for the elderly! What a scandal! He was caught, so Treasurer Meng could only lower his head in front of Kai Yang.It was exactly because of this that Kai Yang became very familiar with the old man.The lecherous old man, with thick skin quickly adjusted his attitude and said: \u201cSame as always?\u201d(TLN: For those who don\u2019t know, thick skin is being very shameless)\u201cYeah.\u201d Kai Yang said earnestly while nodding his head.Not saying a word, Treasurer Meng took out ten silvers from within the counter and recorded it down.Taking the silvers, he asked: \u201cHow many contribution points do I have now?\u201dRolling his eyes, the treasurer replied: \u201cYou earn four points each month and then use one point to exchange for 10 silvers. That leaves you with only three points to save, making a total of twelve points in your account. What, you want to exchange them for a bottle of blood clotting cream?\u201d\u201cNo, I was just asking.\u201d He replied while muttering: \u201cTwelve eh.\u201dSuch a small amount, even if you just wanted to exchange it for a small medicinal herb, it wouldn\u2019t even be enough.With a serious face, Treasurer Meng whispered to him: \u201cLittle Kai Yang, you want to save up and exchange it for a tempered essence pellet. But to save up for it, and then to rank up with your speed, how long will that take?\u201cWon\u2019t I eventually reach it?\u201d He replied chuckling.This left Treasurer Meng speechless. He thought that with his speed, by the time he makes it, this old man will have already been dead for many years.\u201cBut Treasurer Meng, there is one thing I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cSpeak!\u201d The old man said while putting on a \u2018I am in a good mood so I will tell you\u2019 attitude.\u201cThe tempered essence pellet is a very precious medicine, how could it appear here?\u201d\u201cHe he\u2026\u2026..\u201d Speaking with a proud face: \u201cThat is because this pellet is this old man\u2019s treasure, others don\u2019t know about it.\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s yours?\u201d This left Kai Yang stunned. He had always thought that this pellet belonged to the school. No wonder this old thing set such an astronomical price.\u201cNow don\u2019t be angry.\u201d He joyfully said, while taking a drink from the teapot. \u201cI won\u2019t bully you, as long as you bring enough contribution points to exchange, Old Meng will give it to you. For my word is not nothing.\u201d\u201cI will collect it.\u201d He said nodding.With his face downcast Old Meng asked Kai Yang: \u201cI heard that yesterday you got a beating?\u201dImmediately Kai Yang turned around and left.From behind Treasurer Meng shouted: \u201cLet this old man ask, don\u2019t be in such a hurry to walk away.\u201dHe said, but really he was gloating inside.Seeing that Kai Yang had no intention to stop, he straightened up and yelled: \u201cLittle Kai Yang, you should hurry up and leave. Sky Tower is no place for you to be, sooner rather than later you will be killed.\u201dPausing but without turning around Kai Yang sighed: \u201cI have no place to return to.\u201dHe was finished if he left.After holding the teapot for a while, Treasurer Meng said: \u201cThen why did you come?\u201dTempered essence pellet\u2026\u2026.he he, this expensive treasure, how could this old man possibly own it? He only made up this lie to give you hope, he had never thought you would take it seriously.Kai Yang then hurriedly went back to his hut and put the broom away, then briskly walked out.He was going to the small village outside of Tang Lin to buy his food with his ten slivers, like he did every month.For the first time this trip didn\u2019t make him feel tired.Previously, every time he walked down this path, he would get bad asthma attacks again and again. But this time, not only did this not happen, his body felt strengthened compared to before felt less strained walking down the path. Even if he walked a hundred miles, he felt that he wouldn\u2019t tire.Is it the golden skeleton? This made him think of something that happened this morning. While he was sweeping, another disciple had crashed into him, but on the contrary to what normally occurred he had held his ground very stably, while the disciple had fell to the ground.Although this wasn\u2019t much, in retrospect, it was unusual. With his weak physique, how could he not have fallen but the other party fell. It had always been him who fell.Growing more and more excited, he thought about the changes the golden skeleton had brought to his body. Although these changes were small, gradually over the course of time they could culminate into great changes.Thinking of this, Kai Yang recovered and soon walked to town.Looking around, he went to the left hand side of the street. He was going to a rice shop. The shop wasn\u2019t big and the owner is surnamed He, and was a local resident. He treated all customers the same this was one of the reasons why Kai Yang bought from him.Such a small store could be found everywhere. The reason why Black Plum Village was very busy, was because in the surrounding area, apart them there was not only Sky Tower School but also the Windy Rain Sect. The relationship between the two could not be considered bad. The various other small schools couldn\u2019t compare to these two main sects for they didn\u2019t even own their own land.It was precisely because of these two main sects that the village was able to sell many different weapons and maintain such a bustling environment full of many different wares.Creating an environment just like the Han Dynasty\u2019s Capital!After walking around for awhile, Kai Yang inadvertently walked past an alley where some people were gathered. He didn\u2019t know what they were doing, but they were pretty suspicious and gave Kai Yang an extremely vicious glare.Chuckling lightly, he just followed the principle \u2018if they don\u2019t don\u2019t harm me I won\u2019t harm them\u2019 he just ignored them. But among those three there was one who dressed in a similar fashion to Kai Yang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 \u2013 Money & BankruptcyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayKai Yang didn\u2019t think much of this though, because they were in Black Plum Village, located close to Sky Tower, other disciples coming down to the Village was quite common.A little while ago, Kai Yang arrived at the line for rice. The line was quite long, the length of two stalls. The business was very prosperous, but only has one waiter running around serving. The boss was calculating about money on an abacus at the counter, while the wife greeted the guests.As more people finished ordering, the line gradually became shorter and Kai Yang joined the line.\u201cMadame\u201d Kai Yang cried out, a 40 year old looking lady looked up to see who it was. When she saw it was Kai Yang she suddenly smiled and said, \u201cAh, young man, you came to buy rice again.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d He walked to the front of the counter, and pointed a bag behind the counter and said \u201cGive me one bag please.\u201dWhile the lady was tying up the bag with a string she said \u201cYoung man, you buy just one bag a month, is this enough for you?\u201dKai Yang replied, \u201cIt\u2019s enough.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re lying!\u201d The lady retorted while looking at Kai Yang ,\u201dLook at you; such thin arms and legs. If you\u2019re eating properly then what\u2019s with the skinny arms and legs?\u201dYang Kai smiled sheepishly, \u201cI also go to the mountains to hunt, so therefore even with just one bag I won\u2019t be hungry.\u201dWhile the boss concentrated on calculating the bill, he whispered to her: \u201cGo fetch the old rice from the back and give it to this child.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll listen to the boss.\u201d Madame replied with a smile.\u201cHow is this right? You are also trying to make a living here.\u201d Yang Kai said out loudly.The Lady immediately frowned her face, \u201cWhat use is old rice? Leaving it there will only provide a place for insects to grow. Anyways, people won\u2019t eat it. But the owner said that this rice still has some nutrients although less. You wait here I will go get some for you take home.\u201dAs she was saying this she had already started walking towards the back room.Kai Yang\u2019s heart swelled, for he didn\u2019t know what to say. Everytime he came to buy rice, the boss and his wife would always find various excuses to give him more. They say that insects will grow in old rice and the like, but in fact, it was always good rice they gave him not old rice. Their generosity gave Kai Yang hope in this sad world.\u201cThank you Uncle He.\u201d Yang Kai\u2019s voice had a slight trembling to it.The Boss smiled and looked up, \u201cWhen living alone, don\u2019t you have household problems? In the future, whenever you\u2019re hungry just come to our shop, we may not have much, but we still have enough rice for you to eat.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Yang Kai nodded his head, this world still had good people around.Shortly, two enthusiastic people came to the rice store and kicked some people who were ready to order their meals from the line and away from the store front.\u201cAhhhh\u2026..\u201d the second Little Brother fell, landed on his butt, and flipped over. It was a big problem because after he fell to the ground he couldn\u2019t get up again.\u201cWhy?\u201d Boss He called towards the people who had kicked the little brother as he ran out from behind the counter and towards the two men. Kai Yang quickly helped second little brother up whilst intently glaring at the two evil faced men. One of the men, looked pale and thin, was clutching his stomach, while the other one was built like a bear, supported the pale one. These two were the ones who kicked the second brother.\u201cWho\u2019s the boss here?\u201d The man people shouted out.\u201cI am, I am.\u201d Boss He quickly replied. He was only an ordinary merchant, yet the two men who called him out had such fierce looking faces. The swords at their waist and the fierce faces that showed they were not easily trifled with. Boss He wondered what had happened.\u201cWell, well. So you are the black-hearted boss. You even dared to sell poisonous rice to my brother. Look at him! Originally he was a strong man, but after eating your rice he became this sickly. Normally he is as strong as a bear, but he can hardly stand now! You black-hearted person, worrying only about money and going as far as to take lives!\u201dAt this outburst from the man, Boss He worriedly stammered out: \u201cAh, how could this be? How could it?\u201dThe man then said: \u201cHow would I know? This morning my brother bought some rice from you, and made rice porridge, then he became like this after eating the rice he bought from you. I was lucky I didn\u2019t eat any, otherwise I also would\u2019ve become like him.\u201dBoss He\u2019s forehead began to sweat, he took his sleeves and kept wiping his forehead and said \u201cRespected customer, I fear there might be a misunderstanding.\u201d\u201cMisunderstanding? Misunderstanding your mother! If it wasn\u2019t your rice, then what caused him to become like this?\u201d The Han man roared.(TLN: Han people were a type of ethnic inside of China)Kai Yang sat down and pondered the situation while all eyes were on the commotion. Boss He is such a nice person, Kai Yang couldn\u2019t believe that this person who gave him rice, would put poison in it. Not to mention the fact Boss He couldn\u2019t possibly have a black heart in Kai Yang\u2019s mind, a black-hearted businessman wouldn\u2019t be so stupid as to poison his own rice.If these information spread how would he do business in the future? Who would dare come and buy his rice?The two men\u2019s poor excuses were really unbearable, and they couldn\u2019t even consider a that it was something else.Therefore, these two are definitely here to ruin others. But this move was a bit too evil, for they implied that the Boss needed someone to die just to earn some money.Even though Kai Yang\u2019s body was weak he was still a practitioner. And through these past years he had seen countless types of people, so he felt he could accurately judge Boss He. The man was also someone who he owed greatly and when Kai Yang witnessed this, it caused his face to fall. He stood up and said: \u201cThese two\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d One of the men threw him a glare, his anger evident.Kai Yang didn\u2019t speak, but Boss He immediately sprang in front of him. He slowly shook his head for Kai Yang to stop.(TL: *Tear* Boss He, you\u2019re too kind.)\u201cUncle He\u2026..\u201d Kai Yang was stunned.\u201cEven in bankruptcy, avoid misfortunes!\u201d Boss He whispered.Kai Yang just helplessly sighed. That fact that the boss said this, signalled that he knew what the two Han men were on about. But in order to do business, one must have a good name. The earlier commotion had already attracted a lot of attention, if this continued, then the rice stand\u2019s reputation would go down the drain.Even if one knew what they said was false, one could only comply with them and hurriedly hope to end this fiasco before too much damage was done.In desperation, Boss He faced the man: \u201cRegarding your brother\u2019s illness, I can say that it has nothing to do with me\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter the two men heard this, one cried out in anger: \u201cEven if it\u2019s not related, I have already come to this rice stand. If I don\u2019t make the truth clear, then my brother\u2019s suffering would be in vain. He should be sent to the doctor immediately! But of course, if you are willing to shoulder the medical bills, then we are willing to drop the subject.\u201dAfter this statement it was clear the that you really needed to go bankrupt to avoid misfortunes. If people really wanted to extort money, they would do it over a period of time. The demands that these two men were making were too short sighted, if Boss He agreed to pay them off now his rice stands reputation would still suffer. For nothing is watertight and news of him selling poisoned rice would spread. This told Kai Yang that the men were either not interested in extorting Boss He for more money or that they had some other goal.Who would have imagined that these two Han men had not intention of compromising: \u201cYou black hearted boss. Who do think we two brothers are, to be exploited by you so freely? We two brothers were really unlucky to have bought poisoned rice from you! Where is your guilty conscience?\u201dThat statement resonated quite deeply with Kai Yang. He curled his lip while sitting, thinking were they virtuous and living life a clear conscience?Boss He was also stupefied. What? Weren\u2019t these two men here to extort money?While stunned and unsure what to do, more and more people had started to gather. A handsome boy similar to Kai Yang\u2019s age had also appeared. From his looks, he was clearly far better off than Kai Yang.That young man casually walked up to the men, and circled them with interest. Whilst doing so he constantly clicked his tongue.Others may have not noticed, but with a glance Kai Yang recognised those three as the people he spotted earlier in the alley.The crowd just stared at the boy, who had just appeared!Weren\u2019t these three men together? Kai Yang sensed an evil plot in the air.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 \u2013 Do good and in the end you will be sent to heavenPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySuddenly the Sky Tower disciple walked out to the crowd and circled around. His expression slowly turned to one of mockery and arrogance.But the two Han men were not easily mocked and creased their faces: \u201cYou little brat, walking around in circles has made this uncle dizzy. Do you want be the same?\u201dThe youngster just snickered. Standing in front of the two men, watching the \u2018poisoned\u2019 man he said: \u201cYour face is very pale. Looks like your poisoning isn\u2019t simple.\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s not.\u201d He viciously responded: \u201cIf it were not, why would I be here and with my brother, instead of at the doctor\u2019s. We\u2019re here to reveal this boss\u2019 black\u2019 heart and his true colours. Hoping that no one will buy from his store again and suffer as we have.\u201dThis made Boss He\u2019s face pale, for he didn\u2019t know what the aim of these two men was. If it were extorting money then he would understand, but their motives were very puzzling and unclear.Just when he was pondering this, Kai Yang softly inquired: \u201cUncle He, did you offend anybody during this time?\u201dThinking hard, Boss He miserably wailed: \u201cNo one.\u201d\u201cThen could it be that your rice shop prevented someone from earning money?\u201d Even though Kai Yang was young, he had experienced many things. So this thought was not impossible.\u201cThis is just a humble job to survive, how could I prevent others from their income?\u201dNow this was weird! Staring at the ground, Kai Yang thought hard, but was still confused.Then, the Sky Tower disciple sneered and asked the two men a question. They shouted out: \u201cLook, trickery!\u201dWhile shouting, the man resorted to a trick, to open the black heart of the poisonous apple.(TLN: Saying for showing true colours)This surprised people around, for the morning had been quite sluggish. The Han man was wildly hopping about, while his fists were clenched. Jumping, he went to expose the poisonous truth.Moving like this, his once pale face became flushed and rosy.This caused to crowd to gasp. Clearly they were shocked over this sudden change.\u201cPoisoned.\u201d Looking that the two Han men, he sarcastically said: \u201cSuch skill. I respect them, respect.\u201dThe two men couldn\u2019t help but pale. Not only did the fallen man not turn white, he also looked like he wasn\u2019t poisoned.The surrounding people also started to boo. They weren\u2019t stupid, how could they not be able to understand the situation? They didn\u2019t know what motives these men had, but to slander Boss He\u2019s Rice Stand was shameful. Luckily, that Sky Tower disciple had uncovered the truth.More and more people had started to despise the men and started to praise that young man. This young man was naturally easy to like and with this incident, his reputation sky-rocketed.While Kai Yang secretly confirmed his suspicions that they were all acting. They were acting out the play of a honourable knight uncovering foul play and protecting the weak, in order to gain reputation! If he hadn\u2019t seen them together earlier in the alley, he was afraid he would have also believed them.But why did they go to all that effort?The two Han men could no longer keep up the accusations. Staring fiercely at the young man they asked: \u201cBrat, who are you to interfere in my brother\u2019s issues!\u201dGracefully he turned around and arrogantly replied: \u201cI am Sky Tower\u2019s Su Mu!\u201dHearing those words, one of the men became afraid: \u201cNo wonder, you are a Sky Tower disciple. A dragon within here. Today these two brothers have admitted defeat. If fate allows it, I hope we will meet again!\u201dThis sentence felt like it was planned beforehand, making Kai Yang Laugh.Su Mu just laughed coldly: \u201cLeave safely, for I won\u2019t escort you!\u201dWith the situation like this, and if it were indeed no accident like Kai Yang suspected. Then the two men would leave and \u2018Su Mu\u2019 would then seek out the audience\u2019s praise. Especially Boss He\u2019s.But Kai Yang didn\u2019t want Boss He to be fooled. Before those two men left, he quickly said: \u201cYou can\u2019t let them go, they are too despicable. Today\u2019s victim was He\u2019s Rice Stand, but if we don\u2019t teach them a lesson, they may target Liu Shi\u2019s Clothes shop or Jiang Shi\u2019s Grocery.\u201dMost of people who heard this, couldn\u2019t help but notice that what he said was correct. How could they let these despicable villains leave so easily? If they let them go today then tomorrow they might target another shop and leave them destroyed. If it came to that, then they may not be as lucky as Boss He.Thinking of this, the people started to block off the path in front of the two Han men.From his position, Kai Yang could clearly see the panic in Su Mu\u2019s eyes. This in turn, lead Su Mu to source of the voice, to Kai Yang. While the two men exchanged glances and quickly readjusted their expressions.Chuckling, Kai Yang added: \u201cFellow disciple, there is a saying that goes; Good people follow through to the end. Just like how Buddha went to the west, why don\u2019t you and I both arrest these two criminals?\u201d(TLN: Saying that he should finish his job. Also the Buddha reference is to this. You guys should try it, Chinese folklore.)Seeing Kai Yang\u2019s thin and fragile physique, Su Mu couldn\u2019t help but burst out in annoyance: \u201cWho\u2019s your fellow disciple?\u201dKai Yang Replied: \u201cI am also a Sky Tower disciple. I entered the Main Gate three years ago.\u201dThis made Su Mu speechless, for he really was a fellow disciple.\u201cNow, without further ado.\u201d Kai Yang came forward and said: \u201cThroughout the land, it is important to be reasonable. While one must also be chivalrous, so brother you must not let only me take the benefit. Let both of us arrest these two cowardly men and help Boss He claim justice, while also helping Black Plum Village. \u201dWith this statement, the surrounding people began to applaud. This filled Su Mu with anxiety, for he felt as if he was dragged upon a pirate\u2019s ship by this unknown brother. Even he wanted to escape, he couldn\u2019t.Those two men were also glancing continuously at Su Mu looking for guidance/help/assistance. Looking at them, Su Mu couldn\u2019t do anything for them.\u201cBrother, let\u2019s go!\u201d Pulling on Su Mu\u2019s shoulder, Kai Yang rushed over.What is this! Su Mu was in tears, wondering where did this brother come from. This really ruined my plans! But it had already come to this point, so Su Mu could only charge over. While he was preparing to capture them, he was also signalling for them to look for a opportunity to escape.The two men nodded, but Kai Yang saw the exchange and guessed what they were doing.He was worried that Boss He would be tricked, so he took extra precaution and shouted: \u201cFriends, fellow owners, don\u2019t just watch. Come help us two brothers!\u201dHearing this, Boss He also went to help. The rice stand\u2019s youngsters joined in, their hands carrying empty rag bags. Boss He was previously abused by these two men, so naturally they would want revenge.Seeing that Boss He had acted, the crowd couldn\u2019t just watch and they all flocked towards the two men to capture them.Previously the two men weren\u2019t worried, but as they saw this scene, their faces paled. So they quickly yelled: \u201cDon\u2019t hit the face!\u201d While protecting their face, they curled up on the ground.(TL: Tsk, tsk. You\u2019re men, and you say \u201cDon\u2019t hit the face!\u201d, appalling.ED: That\u2019s their money maker. How will they make it as actors if they are beaten up. no mercy from you.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12 \u2013 The TrickPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBang, bang, bang, bang, the sound of the beating rang out. Even though the businesses on this street were run by ordinary people, they currently displayed a powerful fighting spirit that left others flabbergasted. These merchants, more or less did anything for money and were generally detested by others. And now, when they were given to chance to release their stress, how could they be lenient?This was especially true for He\u2019s Rice Stand\u2019s waiter. With rag bags in his hands, he relentlessly beat down on the men.Furthermore, with so many people hitting these men, they couldn\u2019t identify who was hitting them. So these people didn\u2019t have to worry about the consequences.There is strength in numbers. Kai Yang only asked for aid, but before he could lift a finger, he was pushed aside by these merchants.After a while, the beating gradually stopped and you could see the two men curled on the ground bruised all over. The rag bag had also disappeared. Looking at the men, Su Mu\u2019s heart cried out in pain, and his leg started to cramp. For the men were beaten bloody and their faces so swollen, that even theirs mothers won\u2019t be able to recognise them.(ED: No mercy on their faces, crowd has the same attitude as you, so harshTL: Geez, just saying.)This situation only occurred because the men didn\u2019t have enough strength to protect themselves. Although they had swords, one could see that it was only for decoration. If they could use them would they suffer these attacks?Though on the other hand, how could experts stoop so low as to perform such despicable acts?Now, even though the beating was finished the merchants remained.The two Han men with their horrendous faces, and hearts full of fear weakly called: \u201cSu\u2026.\u201d Their hands trembling.Unfortunately, Su Mu\u2019s expression changed and he loudly exclaimed: \u201cWhat su, you want this young master to give you *pasty bones?\u201d(TLN: *Because his name is Su, a play a words with his name\u2019s meaning)Seeing this, Kai Yang smiled and proclaimed: \u201cYou two scumbags! I don\u2019t know have many others you have framed, but it\u2019s extremely hateful!\u201dHis words words are an exaggeration, but for the merchants present, this seemed like the truth. That waiter who previously held the rag bag spat: \u201cPei, you trashes. You actually dared to act arrogantly at this rice stand.\u201dThe waiter continued to let out his frustrations, but didn\u2019t expect Kai Yang to expand on his statement: \u201cCorrect. These types of people should really die. Fellow disciple, why don\u2019t you and I each kill one. That will teach them to break the law again and also be for the greater good.\u201dHearing this remark, the two people on the floor started to break out in cold sweat and were terrified. They had never expected this frail boy to be so ruthless.Su Mu just stared at him, trying to figure out whether or not he was joking. But Kai Yang\u2019s face held no sign that it was a joke.To tell the truth, although what the men did was cowardly, it wasn\u2019t serious enough to die for. Undoubtedly Kai Yang\u2019s punishment was a little too cruel.Su Mu could only ask: \u201cBrother, isn\u2019t that a bit excessive? Right?\u201d\u201cExcessive?\u201d Kai Yang just shook his head: \u201cIf their little lie were to succeed today, then Boss He\u2019s life would have been ruined. How would he maintain a livelihood? This is pushing people to the limits, so how is this excessive? You know, for every person, every action that they do, will have a consequence.\u201dPreviously, when those merchant heard Kai Yang\u2019s words, they had also thought this. But hearing his reasoning, they understood the sense behind his words and were conflicted. But the final decision wasn\u2019t up to them, so they just stood on the sidelines. But when Boss He wanted to say something, he was stopped by a look from Kai Yang.\u201cThis\u2026..this may certainly be the case, but we can\u2019t just casually go killing people.\u201d Now Su Mu was really worried. He didn\u2019t think that this disciple in front of him was so ruthless and merciless. Originally he had planned it out quite well; Firstly, those two men would go slander Boss He and then he would go and stop them, saving Boss He. Then they would escape and he would receive gratitude from the Boss thus accomplishing his goal. But he hadn\u2019t thought that such a vicious disciple would appear, so easily choosing to kill them.This was far from good.Su Mu could see that the two men were pleading him to save them. Within those gazes, were signs of threats. How could Su Mu not understand their meaning?It was like being tied to the body of a grasshopper. If we are to suffer a tragic end, then you would not come out unharmed. That was their meaning..At that moment, Kai Yang said: \u201cBrother, there is no other method. Through my experiences, killing is a natural thing. Could it be that you haven\u2019t killed before? Or you guys already know each other\u2026\u2026.so you are unwilling to kill?\u201dThis statement made Su Mu\u2019s heart jump to his throat. Turning around to look at Kai Yang, he found a mischievous smile.\u201cBrother what do you mean?\u201d With a cool face he questioned, while thinking whether or not Kai Yang saw through him. He hadn\u2019t revealed any clues, so how could he know?What he didn\u2019t know, was that Kai Yang knew of his plan purely by coincidence. If not he would had also been fooled.Boss He was also smart, he understood the hidden meaning in Kai Yang\u2019s words and asked Su Mu: \u201cLittle brother, what tune are you singing?\u201d(TLN: Chinese phrasing of what are you up to/planning.)Kai Yang had revealed a portion of Su Mu\u2019s true colours, how could Boss He not be able to see?Kai Yang just shook his head, he didn\u2019t point out anything in particular but just continued to stare at Su Mu: \u201cBrother, I think that you are a courageous person, but you are hesitating. Don\u2019t worry, I am here to accompany you and the villagers too. So what are you afraid of?\u201d\u201cWhat am I afraid of?\u201d Su Mu laughed out loud, as if reassuring himself, he said: \u201cWhat am I afraid of? Isn\u2019t it just killing a person? Who hasn\u2019t killed before?\u201dIt was like he was unwillingly to admit he hadn\u2019t killed before, in front of Kai Yang.In the end, this person\u2019s disposition shocked him. Su Mu hadn\u2019t stepped down from the challenge.Su Mu then directed a cold, ruthless intent towards the men lying on the ground. Looking into that young man\u2019s eyes, those two men knew they were finished. This round, they were used too thoroughly.\u201cBrother, let\u2019s do it.\u201d Kai Yang continued to pour oil on the flame.Breathing deeply, Su Mu slowly nodded.Seeing this happen, the two men immediately knew their end was nigh. So how could they endure without doing anything? Jumping up, they pointed towards Su Mu and proclaimed: \u201cSu Mu, you treacherous bastard. You asked us brothers for a favour, to slander Boss He\u2019s stand so that you could come to the rescue and become a hero. But how do you repay us? Not only are we beaten like pigs, now we have to die for your crimes. You really are trash.\u201d\u201cYou lie!\u201d Hearing his scheme revealed, Su Mu was furious.\u201cHmph!\u201d As if their injuries didn\u2019t affect them, the men just sneered and the larger man shouted out loudly, informing all: \u201cEverybody, young or old, today my brother and I came out and caused trouble for you. But this was all at the command of Su Mu. He had taken fancy to Boss He\u2019s daughter, but sadly she rejected him. So he hatched a plan to obtain her.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 \u2013 Just you waitPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen this was revealed, something clicked inside the heads of the onlookers. Many people could not help but turn to look at Su Mu with disbelief in their eyes.So that was it! Kai Yang was satisfied that he had guessed correctly, Su Mu really had an ulterior motive. Though he had thought it was something related to profit or reputation. He hadn\u2019t thought it was actually for his own sexual desires.He had also met the Boss\u2019 daughter, even though she wasn\u2019t outrageously beautiful, she was still a work of art. Alluring body, delicate features, slim figure and the most beautiful girl in the entire village at only fourteen.Such a young girl, unfortunately had caught Su Mu\u2019s eye, provoking such trouble.\u201cWhat utter rubbish!\u201d Su Mu\u2019s face was as red as a tomato, trying to deny the truth.Sneering the man continued to say: \u201cI have said no lies. Even though us two brothers have our faults, and do some criminal acts,slandering Boss He and poisoning his rice this we would never do. Fellow people, you should know that sabotaging others\u2019 livelihoods, is equal to sabotaging my own. So how can I survive? Everything was instigated by this little brat.\u201dThis statement was very sincere, causing everybody to start laughing.In a timely manner Kai Yang asked: \u201cAfter this was over how much did he promise to give?\u201d\u201cFifty two silvers!\u201d The man replied.\u201cFifty two, that\u2019s a lot.\u201d Kai Yang softly said while nodding.During this banter, Boss He was listening carefully. This made him understand the situation thoroughly, turning towards Su Mu he angrily said: \u201cYou despicable person. You actually dared to to use such dirty methods to get my daughter. Thankfully she has eyes and saw your true face. Ah, how could Sky Tower have such a degenerate disciple. You are ruining your school\u2019s good name. You are vain and selfish, with a character completely opposite to brother Yang. I feel ashamed for your mother and father.\u201dSurrounding merchants also started to feel more contempt towards Su Mu\u2019s outrageous acts.Su Mu\u2019s face was bright red, for he knew that he could no longer come back to Black Plum Village. For his mask had been taken away and his true face revealed.And the source of all his misfortunes was in front of him\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026this disciple! If not for him, he would have been able to win the boss\u2019 favour and further his reputation. That would have made it easier to curry the daughter\u2019s love for him.But all that planning had gone to waste. Not only had he failed to gain any reputation, he had also lost reputation he had previously for being a disciple of Sky Tower.Under that situation, Su Mu put on a calm face and turned towards Kai Yang and asked: \u201cBrother, how may I call you?\u201d\u201cYou guess!\u201d Kai Yang replied with a wink.Taking a deep breath Su Mu said: \u201cThough you may chose to withhold your identity, I will able able to find out. For you have already entered the school for three years, yet you are not a official disciple. That means you are a Trial Disciple and within the entire school, there are only a few of you. Finding you will be simple.\u201dWhen he finished he immediately turned around and left. In the end, he did have some strength. For those who blocked his path, he pushed them to the side. Waltzing away unhinderedWhen he had left, the people had only just remembered the two Han men. But where were they? There was no trace, for when Kai Yang and Su Mu were arguing, they had sneakily ran away.The debacle had finally been resolved. Kai Yang was satisfied, for he had exposed the deceit, gained approval from the merchants and Boss He was especially grateful to him.That waiter also looked at Kai Yang in worship.After the crowd dispersed, the Boss\u2019 wife also came out. Taking Kai Yang\u2019s hand, the more she looked, the more she came to like him.On the contrary, Boss He\u2019s he was full of worry: \u201cVirtuous nephew Yang, today you have offended Su Mu. I\u2019m afraid that in the future, this will cause you ceaseless trouble.\u201dAfter this incident, Boss He\u2019s started to refer to Kai Yang more intimately.\u201cAfraid?.\u201d Kai Yang just smiled. \u201cThe Main Gate has its own rules, so even if he hates me to death he can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\u201cEven so, you must be careful nephew. If because of your involvement in this matter you were to suffer misfortune then I as your Uncle would worry greatly.\u201cI will be careful.\u201d He consoled.Kai Yang was immensely grateful to the He couple for extending a helping hand. They even insisted he stay for dinner, originally Kai Yang wanted to, but was scared away by the boss\u2019 wife.\u201cLittle Yang, where are you parents? Where do you live? Have you married already?\u201dLooking at this, clearly the boss\u2019 wife wanted to become his mother-in-law. Knowing this, Kai Yang hurriedly left.When he left, he was carrying a bag of white rice, but it far surpassed the amount 20 silvers could get you. So for an entire month, Kai Yang didn\u2019t have to worry amount his meals.Originally, Kai Yang was worried that Su Mu would ambush him on his way back. For as innocent as Su Mu looked, he was a sinister and treacherous snake on the inside, this was not impossible. Though, even when Kai Yang returned, Su Mu hadn\u2019t appeared.He thought about it carefully, not attacking was the correct choice. Even though duels between disciples often resulted in death, the Main Gate didn\u2019t allow the needless killing of others. In short, if Su Mu had attacked on his way back to the school, then when things leaked out, it would have resulted in his own doom too.If he wanted to deal with Kai Yang, then he would definitely come to challenge him, while making a fuss too. As for the matter of Kai Yang\u2019s identity, there is no doubt that he would be able to find it. In the Sky Tower, as long as Su Mu inquired a bit, then naturally he would find his identity.Su Mu\u2019s true strength, Kai Yang didn\u2019t fully see, but he most definitely was at the peak of the tempered body. The only thing was he didn\u2019t know what stage exactly.Seems like he must focus more on his practises. Otherwise, Kai Yang truly couldn\u2019t continue staying at Sky Tower.Knowing this, Kai Yang swiftly returned back to his hut to practise.At this hour, he was unable to practise the Tempered Body Record, but he could practise the basic skills that the school gave. These basic skills were to establish the foundations for the tempered body, to achieve spiritual consumption beyond his own body. This was the aim.(TLN: It\u2019s talking about things like qi/ki/spiritual energy)Kai Yang\u2019s previous usage of the Shaolin arts and the leg whip were all based around his foundation work. If not for this, then the skills couldn\u2019t be considered true martial arts. They would only be considered as the basic of basic skills, essential for all schools and families.To the left of Kai Yang\u2019s hut, there a wooden figure. This was made, from a century old tree, by Kai Yang to practise on. Small dents were littered over it, there were even traces of blood. These were all made through Kai Yang\u2019s many days of diligent training.Assuming his position, Kai Yang started to hit the wooden man. He infused all his might into each strike, beating the wooden man relentlessly. Peng, peng rang out as he struck the wooden man. However, after a few strikes, he felt that something was amiss.It was his own fists and leg so he clearly felt that they were stronger than before. From the strike and the sound it made, all of them were stronger and more stable, incomparable to before. And over time, his hand and the bones started to feel numb and warm. This clearly indicated that he was stimulating his meridians, increasing his atmospheric affinity.Reaching the tempered body fourth stage, gives birth to the atmospheric affinity, developing your meridians further and allowing you to sense the energy more clearly. This warm feeling was Kai Yang\u2019s meridians developing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14 \u2013 IncensePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayKai Yang practised until the sun set, only then did he stop. Even after this period of time, not only was he not fatigued, he even felt more alive. Ever since he merged with that golden skeleton his strength seemed to skyrocket. Walking twenty miles today didn\u2019t even tire him out, even with the added weight of the sack of rice he hadn\u2019t become fatigued.It was only when he was cultivating his tempered body, that he would truly feel pressured. Thinking about that morning\u2019s practise, Kai Yang couldn\u2019t help but shudder. That pressure was like the heaven and earth were crushing him, horrifying.But with strain/pressure come development. Without extreme pressure, how could you possibly advance.Only then, would a person\u2019s true potential show. And only then would your strength grow, step by step, each time breaking past your limits.Though currently, even after throwing large amounts of punches and kicks out, Kai Yang has yet to feel any fatigue. He doesn\u2019t feel strained, how can he force out his potential and improve?This made things difficult and made him depressed. That skeleton also gave him extreme recovery, making the basic skills of the school useless. Did that mean that he could only practise for half an hour each day at sunrise?Daylight had around twelve full hours, and yet he could only practise for half an hour. What would he do the rest of the time? Sleep? This was obviously impossible, Kai Yang immediately rejected the idea.(TL: wow getting stronger by only practising 30 mins each day while sleeping the rest? lucky.ED: so glad he\u2019s not following in the footsteps of contribution Hall Uncle)While he absentmindedly cooked, Kai Yang thought about how he should train to exhaustion. If anyone else knew of this, they would have laughed to death.Other practitioners may have wanted to take it easier, but Kai Yang wanted to push himself to the limit.In the end, he still couldn\u2019t think of any good methods. Though the main reason was Kai Yang needed elixirs to help boost his training. There were also other methods, but in the end, all of these had one thing in common, they required\u2014- money.In Sky Tower, contribution points were the currency. Alas, Kai Yang was poor and only had a measly twelve points.After the rice finished cooking, he wolfed down a few bowls. Although there were no sides dishes, and he could only eat plain rice, Kai Yang was very satisfied. That was the only meal in the past few days, which made him full.After dinner, he couldn\u2019t go train, so he went to take a bath. After that he lay down and went to bed. Continuing his practise, there would be no result, so he might as well try to solve that problem. Consider the solutions, to hasten the work speed.After thinking for awhile, he suddenly remembered; the black book.One of the pages had something inside, so Kai Yang figured that the other pages would be the same. So if he had enough strength, he could unseal each page.The first page contained the Golden Skeleton, which was also the cause of his current predicament.While the second dealt with the methods to cultivate the tempered body with Golden skeleton.However the third page remained blank. He had already tried to decipher it, but Kai Yang concluded he wasn\u2019t strong enough yet.With the first and second pages unlocked, Kai Yang could start to study them. But after good half day he still couldn\u2019t figure them out. Until he accidentally turned to the third page and went into a trance.Eh? Kai Yang frowned as he started to read the third page.Almost instantly, countless gold words started to appear on the page and jumped into his mind. Then a small whirlpool started to appear in the center of the page. From it, arose an antique incense burner.This turn of events left Kai Yang in shock, but quickly he started to rejoice.Ah right, didn\u2019t he break through into the fourth stage this morning? Last night he was still in the third stage, but today he\u2019s in the fourth. So that\u2019s why he couldn\u2019t access the third page before?Although it was only one level, it had still hindered his ability to comprehend the third page.After he thought about this, Kai Yang couldn\u2019t help but feel regret. If this morning he had discovered this, then he wouldn\u2019t need to waste time now thinking about it.Calming his beating heart, Kai Yang held the incense burner and carefully inspected it.This burner wasn\u2019t large in size, and was a common item used by people. But it was half sealed, with a lid on the mouth and a few holes. It was also antique and of outstanding quality, but it wasn\u2019t attention grabbing at all.Gently he sniffed, but there was no odor and slowly he lowered it.What is it made of? Even after a while, Kai Yang still didn\u2019t know but could only go on the information imprinted in his mind.After a short pause, Kai Yang opened his eyes with a strange look in them.According to the information in his mind, this incense burner could aid him during training. The burner itself has no special properties, however if you were to gather herbs and burn them in it, the fragrance released would aid you during training.Different herbs were needed for different stages.Unfortunately, Kai Yang had some doubts. The plants needed to aid him at his current level were the Three Leaved Destruction/Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass.According to his understanding, the value of these two herbs were not high but they were very hard to find. They also possessed small amounts of toxins. Inhaled over a short period of time these toxins would do no lasting damage, but over many years the accumulation in your body would really injure you.Would these two herbs really be effective in helping him?These herbs were definitely available in the Contribution Hall, but with Old Man Meng\u2019s personality, he would definitely charge high prices for them. And with only a few points in his possession, how could he spend them like that?There was only one option left. He would have to venture into the Black Wind Mountains to look for them himself. Kai Yang had already hunted in there before, so was quite familiar with its geography and perhaps the herbs were there.Tomorrow into the mountains he shall go! With his problems currently solved, Kai Yang slowly drifted to sleep. But before he fell asleep, he checked the fourth page so as to not repeat this morning\u2019s embarrassing action. Unfortunately nothing appeared, it seemed that Tempered Body Fourth Stage was not sufficient for this page.The next morning, Kai Yang got up early.Yesterday\u2019s practise had already had such a large impact on his cultivation, so naturally he would make full use of the short time he had to cultivate. Not to mention, he was not a lazy person.While immersing himself in the purple eastern air/gas, that slow but with the might of heaven and earth infused, Tempered Body Record fist\u2019s might gradually unfolded.While he was a stage stronger than yesterday, Kai Yang still didn\u2019t make much progress on the fist. You could only perform it twenty times and when he touched his back, torturous pain responded. His back, hip and bones all ached, they felt like smashed beans.Inhaling a mouthful of purple gas, his bodily senses as energy became clearer. His meridians all opened up and began to expel the impurities in his body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 \u2013 Looking for Medicine inside the MountainPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWith his daily training finished, he started his sweeping, which since absorbing the golden skeleton he had been able to complete in only one hour. After he finished sweeping he ran to the Contribution Hall.Although Kai Yang had decided to go into the mountains to find the herbs, he had no knowledge regarding herbology. He had only heard of the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass, and didn\u2019t know what they looked like.Most of his preparatory work for his journey into the Black Wind Mountain was done. To avoid an embarrassing situation, Kai Yang hurried to the Contribution Hall to write down the herbs\u2019 appearance.Originally he had planned to ask Treasurer Meng to teach him, he hadn\u2019t expected Treasurer Meng to give him a book on herbs instead.Looking at the book, Kai Yang found that it had an introduction to herbs and their medical properties, habitats and illustrations. Though it would give create a feeling of disappointment in those who read it. As it merely contained information on ordinary grade herbs and nothing on the herbs of a higher grade, but it was quite suitable for Kai Yang\u2019s current needs.Just as practitioners were classified into different ranks, so to were herbs, weapons and medicinal pellets. They were divided into, Ordinary Grade, Earth Grade, Heaven Grade, Mystery Grade, Spirit Grade and Saint Grade. Each of the Grades were then divided into the lower, middle and peak level.Luckily the herbs that Kai Yang needed were both Ordinary Grade, Lower class herbs so they were in the book. And since they were such a low grade, their value wasn\u2019t high.After he left the Contribution Hall, Kai Yang went to the General Affairs Office. Afterall he was still a sweeper of Sky Tower\u2019s and this roundabout journey to Black Wind Mountain would take more than a day. So he had to ask to be excused from his work.The General Affairs Office didn\u2019t make things difficult for him. They gave Kai Yang three days of leave, with his obligations taken care of he set off\u2026Black Wind Mountain was only twenty miles away from Sky Tower by foot. Since it wasn\u2019t that far, Kai Yang frequently went there to hunt for his meals, making him quite familiar with the terrain.In this mountain was a vast and diverse range of herbs. But since it was his first time collecting herbs, Kai Yang made sure to be fully prepared. Carrying his water, food supplies, a shovel and a bag, he hit the road.Rushing over, Kai Yang came to Black Wind Mountain and surveyed the area. The Mountain was like a prehistoric monster, lying down between the heavens and the earth. Imposing, with no end in sight, the mountain with its lush forests, jagged edges proudly stood against the horizon. Standing there, Kai Yang felt a cool breeze blow through his hair.Within Black Wind Mountain lived many ferocious beasts. Some high levelled ferocious beasts could even make martial practitioners flee with no chance of victory. So generally when people ventured into the mountain, they wouldn\u2019t go too deep. The first thirty or so miles were classified as the safe zone, the next ten miles were the dangerous zone. And the area beyond that, was the life-threatening zone. Basically the deeper you went, the more dangerous it was.Since Kai Yang was only looking for ordinary grade lower level herbs he didn\u2019t need to venture too far in. So naturally he didn\u2019t have to worry about his safety as he would only be searching within the safe zone.Currently it was still in the early hours of the morning and Kai Yang was trying to recall whether or not he had stumbled upon those herbs in his previous trips to the mountain. But it didn\u2019t matter whether he had or not, as he was prepared this time to find them equipped with the knowledge from the book.Thinking back, Kai Yang remembered that there were many potential places for herbs to grow in. In his current situation he didn\u2019t even know the locations of the herbs he wanted to find.But filled with anticipation, Kai Yang followed the familiar track into Black Wind Mountain.After half an hour Kai Yang spotted his first harvest hidden within the thicket next to the track he, was a bunch of Li Chi/Sharp Teeth herbs. Harvesting them, Kai Yang put them into his bag and continued his search, thinking to himself this was a good start. Walking down the road, Kai Yang looked at the various vegetation scattered about, and memories of the forest came flooding back, informing him of his location. With his knowledge of the Mountain, gained from hunting, he could accurately create a mental map of where he was in relation to Sky Tower, preventing him from getting lost. By evening Kai Yang had collected four different types of herbs.When searching for herbs it is naturally very hard,not to mention that many people like to come here to collect herbs, making it even harder to find them. Although Kai Yang only found four herbs, he was still pretty satisfied.Unfortunately Kai Yang didn\u2019t need these four herbs, to make matters worse their grades were only at Ordinary Grade, lower level too. Nevertheless if he were to take them back, he could exchange them for contribution points, so they were of some value.At this time the sun had already started to set. Hurrying, Kai Yang finally arrived at an area which was suitable for the growth of many herbs.This area was very strange, for all its bountiful vegetation it was devoid of any living presence. Especially for an area of thirty feet around around the area of herbs the land was completely dead and nothing grew, not even weeds.Though in the center of the this wasteland, there were three bunches of grass. They fluttered in the wind, Kai Yang saw that they were brown coloured, and thought that is was just necrosis. But this was just the grass\u2019 natural colour.After looking at it in more detail Kai Yang recognised them as a type of herb and with a sigh of relief, rushed over. Smiling widely, he quickly dug them all up.A little while later, these three herbs were collected.As he held these herbs, Kai Yang took out the herbology book that Treasurer Meng gave him earlier and checked it to see where he had seen them before. They were indeed the Dead Jedi Tree Grass. The illustrations, growth and environment all matched up.Dead Jedi Tree Grass grew from dead trees, which made it quite easy to find. Basically in the mountains, any place that had dead land, you could find it growing nearby.Carefully, Kai Yang placed the grass in his bag and took out some water and food, then took out his water and food and looked for a place to eat and rest.This time when he entered the mountains his main goal was to find the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass, now that he had found the Dead Jedi Tree Grass he need to switch his focus to the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower. Not only did he need to find the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower but he also needed a large quantity of it.. Kai Yang decided he must double his efforts.Though right now, it was already evening and the sun had set. This was naturally an inconvenient time to search for herbs so Kai Yang decided to find a spot to rest and continue tomorrow.Previously when he entered/forayed into the mountains, he had never stayed overnight, however as the saying goes \u201cEven if you hadn\u2019t tasted pork, you have at least seen a pig before\u201d. On that note, he naturally knew the dangers of the mountains at night.(TLN: I think it\u2019s pretty self-explanatory. But for those who are confused, it means that even if you haven\u2019t experienced some things, you should have some knowledge of them.) Man even got to edit the comments, no rest for the wickedAfter he found the nearest tree, Kai Yang climbed up and looked for a suitable place to sleep, after locating a place he immediately laid down and closed his eyes.(ED: Trees are so hard to locate in a forest on a mountain)By one-thirty am, Kai Yang had yet to fall asleep, so he took out the black book and turned to page three. With a thought, the incense burner floated out.This was also a little mystery that Kai Yang had solved about the black book. Anything that was stored inside could be called out and returned at will. It was afterall a storage book, and the burner had obviously been placed in there before so this function didn\u2019t come as a complete surprise.(TL: Our MC isn\u2019t very bright. It\u2019s a storage book, if you could take things out, why couldn\u2019t they be put back in? How did the burner end up in it in the first place? A mystery\u2026\u2026..\u0ca0_\u0ca0)What Kai Yang didn\u2019t understand was that apart from the incense burner, other things could not be stored in the book. This made him wonder, was the black book a soul stone? Do soul stones normally have restrictions on what to accept and reject?After playing with the black book for a while, Kai Yang fell asleep. He had just spent the entire day walking around the mountain after all.After a peaceful night, Kai Yang got up early the next morning and practised the tempered body record for half an hour. In order to gather a good harvest, he must work very hard for the next two days. He also felt that he was on the brink of a breakthrough, not only did he feel that his atmospheric sense was at the utmost limit, he also felt his body was as well. Kai Yang just needed a final push in order to breakthrough.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

For it took him three years to make it to the tempered body third stage. But on the second day of obtaining this book, he had broken through and now once again he will break through again. This training speed also made Kai Yang somewhat scared.Practising the tempered body record consumed a large amount of stamina. So Kai Yang rested afterwards and slowly regained his stamina . After he had regained his stamina he ate some of the remain food and continued his search for the herbs.Yesterday he had travelled to all the places from his memory that could potentially grow his required herbs. Today he would have to rely on luck. Fortunately, the value of these herbs were not high, so the chance of finding them today was still high.(TL: Trust me Kai Yang, luck is the only thing you don\u2019t need to worry about.)After an entire day of searching, Kai Yang had found a total of seventy eight herbs and two Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flowers. This time he had finally found the herbs he required to activate the incense burner, but the quantity he had was still lacking.Time passed by, and soon darkness came. Kai Yang was still awake though, it was not because he wasn\u2019t tired but rather that he was too hungry to fall asleep.(\uff08\uff0a\u3007\u25a1\u3007\uff09\u2026\u2026! &amp; (O.O) )Originally he had planned to hunt some wild game, but had not even seen a single rabbit. Unfortunately he could only find some fingernail-sized berries which were very sour. When he finished eating them it only made him feel even more hungry.Ah! If I knew that this was going to happen, I would have brought more rice balls! Kai Yang repented. There is no shop in these desolate areas, where is he going to find food?This hunger was a real embarrassment. Kai Yang then saw in the distance, a hint of a fire. Instantly his energy came back, picking himself up he walked towards it.They dared to light a fire in a forest; these people were either idiots or they had nothing to fear. This time, these people belonged to the latter.When he approached, a person near the fire thundered: \u201cWho!\u201d(TL &amp; ED: T^T, Kai Yang you\u2019re finally going to make some friends)At that moment, Kai Yang felt his muscles tighten and his spine shiver. The two people by the fire were vigilant. One was tall and the other was short.One had a burly physique and held a bow with an arrow notched he pointed the arrow at Kai Yang. The other was a young boy, aged about eleven and his eyes were bright and held no trace of fear. In this boy\u2019s hand was also a bow, and he also had notched an arrow back, but it was much smaller.(TL: Maybe not\u2026\u2026..ED: How can you doubt our MC, have some faith)Although Kai Yang was faced with the two arrows, he didn\u2019t have the slightest intention to retaliate. Walking around, he acted as if their threats were nothing big.\u201cTake it easy. I only entered the mountain to collect herbs.\u201d Kai Yang quickly said.After they heard this, the two people looked at each other. The burly (I really want to say buff) slowly lowered his bow and arrow down. He then signalled for the boy to relax and laughed: \u201cI had thought that the fire had attracted a wild beast, but it was just a false alarm.\u201d\u201cSorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Kai said slightly embarrassed and laughed.Touching his forehead, the burly man waved towards Kai Yang: \u201cCome, the nights are cold and surviving alone here will not be easy.\u201dWhen he heard this, Kai Yang walked up and sat next to the fire. Beside him, the burly man kept looking at Kai Yang and couldn\u2019t but feel pity when he saw Kai Yang\u2019s thin, boney body.Now that they were sitting together it would be natural to talk to each other. From this chat, Kai Yang learnt that this father and son pair lived at the foot of the mountain, and came here to hunt and earn a living. Although they weren\u2019t rich, it was enough to maintain adequate food and clothing. The boy, although he was young, was a veteran at hunting. And along with his father, they had come to Black Wind Mountains many times to hunt. Thus their knowledge of the mountain was far greater than Kai Yang\u2019s.Kai Yang also told them a bit about himself. After he told them that he was a Sky Tower disciple, the burly man was taken aback. While the little boy became more interested in Kai Yang and kept on glancing at him with his glossy, black eyes.The Han man said: \u201cMy son also wanted to train to become a practitioner, but his talent was not enough and he was refused. So he practically worships you people.\u201dThis statement made Kai Yang recall the past three years and his experiences. Not only did it move him deeply, it also made him softly rub the boy\u2019s head with affection.When he was about to say something, Kai Yang\u2019s stomach grumbled loudly. The little boy stared blankly and suddenly laugh out loud, from his bag he took out some dry rations and gave it Kai Yang.This once again made him very moved, but he didn\u2019t accept. Kai Yang looked at the burly man and he smiled: \u201cEat it. It seems that you did not eat anything today.\u201dThis time Kai Yang didn\u2019t reject the offering and quickly wolfed down the rations.After chatting some more the three then went to sleep around the fire. Though Kai Yang didn\u2019t dare sleep too heavily, if any danger were to approach the father and son, he would be able to react. He also considered this to be returning the favor for giving him the rations previously.Fortunately the night passed peacefully and nothing happened.When the morning arrived Kai Yang didn\u2019t wait for the father and son to wake before quietly leaving. But before he left, he left two herbs behind as a thank you for last night.If these two herbs were crumpled they had a healing effect. Since they were constantly in the mountains, these herbs were bound to be useful to the father and son pair.With the eastern purple gas increasing in volume, Kai Yang trained the tempered body record for half an hour. When he finished his practise, Kai Yang took in a large breath of the purple gas causing his meridians to suddenly shake. A warm feeling then began surging through his body, with the energy in his meridians swirling endlesslyThe tempered body fifth stage! His intuition was correct, he indeed broke through today. After practising for half an hour he really broke through to the next stage!Kai Yang was extremely happy, and felt more and more grateful towards the golden skeleton in his body.Although it had not been very long since he obtained the proud golden skeleton, he had broken through twice thanks to it and the tempered body record. This speed was simply unmatched. And this was practising under quite a number of restrictions. If he could practise all the time, what speed would he reach then?This thought left Kai Yang somewhat speechless. Though after all, the tempered body was only the foundation to becoming a true warrior. Training the early stages were easier, the higher the realms, the greater the difficulty to train in.After a quick rest Kai Yang continued to search for herbs.Today he had yet again gained quite a harvest. He had collected more than a dozen herbs and caught a plump rabbit, solving his food problems.This was already the the third day of his mountain journey and he had reached the end of the ten mile safety zone. Any further and Kai Yang dared not to enter inside, for with his current strength his only option was to become food for the beasts within.Although he did not go too deep, his harvest was still quite good. He had collected more than twenty different types of herbs, and counting the previous two days he had forty different types making his journey here very fruitful. Unfortunately the two main herbs that he needed were very small in quantity.To find forty different types of herbs in three days was no small harvest. Even if they were all ordinary grade, lower rank herbs, he was still able to exchange them for a fair amount of contribution points. But this greatly reduced his training time, doing more harm than good.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17 \u2013 Battling the Demonic BeastPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was now the afternoon and Kai Yang had started to walk towards the track that would lead him back to Sky Tower.Kai Yang was only given three days of leave, so he had to return before tomorrow morning, otherwise there would be harsh punishment waiting for him.Kai Yang felt he had plenty of time and was certain that he could return before dark. Afterall, he was only hundred miles away, not a long distance.In his heart he held great anticipation with regard to the black book\u2019s third page. Thinking about the results it would bring for him made him delighted and put a bounce in his steps.Halfway through his journey back Kai Yang heard an unexpected, piercing cry not to far from his position. There was the sound of a child screaming/crying mixed in.When he heard this he paused his footsteps and strained his ears. Soon after, his face changed and Kai Yang swiftly ran towards the direction of the sound.When he was listening to the sound, he recognised it as the sounds of the father and son pair from the night before. And that child\u2019s crying sound was from the little boy.Those two probably had encountered some sort of trouble, or why would they make such a ruckus. Last night they had given Kai Yang some of their rations, and even if were for their past kindness, how could he just ignore their trouble?As he ran towards them, the father\u2019s roaring became increasingly desperate and the boy\u2019s grew softer and softer.Kai Yang\u2019s face gradually hardened and he started to have a bad feeling.By the time Kai Yang arrived, the father\u2019s roar could no longer be heard and he only saw a dark cave in a high hill. To the side of the cave in the midsts of some bushes, tangled between some spiderwebs was a silver bow. This bow the same one the little boy had been holding the previous night.Without thinking, Kai Yang threw this possessions onto the ground, heightened his senses and plunged straight into that dark and sinister cave.Although the light inside the cave was not bright, it was still enough to see.When he looked around, Kai Yang was shocked to discover that the cave was covered in webs. On the walls and the ground, they crisscrossed each other and varied in thicknesses. Layer upon layer, the road ahead was blocked by the multitude of webs.Not only that, the cave was damp. The water dripped down at a steady pace, and when Kai Yang took a step forward, his foot sank into the ground.Steeling his nerves, Kai Yang walked to the sound of deep breathing. Only he saw a large human sized cocoon spun from a spider\u2019s thread in a chrysalis-like state. At the top, it revealed a human face, that face belonged to the burly man from the night before.Worriedly, Kai Yang dashed over to the trapped hunter, his worry eased upon discovering that he was only unconscious.Hearing Kai Yang calling to him, the hunter groggily awoke and called feebly: \u201cSave the child! My son was dragged further inside. I beg of you, please save my child!\u201d\u201cGot dragged inside?\u201d This shocked Kai Yang, as he struggled to free the hunter from the web. Sadly the web was too strong for his current strength, being unable to break it he could only temporarily give up. Diving into the hole, he chased after the little boy.From behind the hunter warned: \u201cBe careful! That is a Demonic Spider Beast!\u201dWhen he heard the words, Demonic Spider Beast, Kai Yang\u2019s heart thumped loudly. These demonic beasts were not like ordinary wild animals; they loved to slaughter. They were true ferocious beasts and Kai Yang was not a match for even the lowest among them with his current strength.In the Black Wind Mountains, the reason why the first thirty miles were deemed a safe zone, was precisely because there were no ferocious beasts. Unfortunately it seemed, one had appeared. This was seriously outside one\u2019s expectations.Now that he knew it was a ferocious beast, Kai Yang movements became more and more cautious and soft. Slowly, he groped his way through the tunnel and after about ten feet, he spotted the little boy.The son was in a similar situation to his father, wrapped up in a cocoon which was suspended in mid air by a larger spider web.At the side of the little boy, there was an enormously, large flower patterned spider sucking on a straw. The straw was inserted in the little boy\u2019s arm, and you could clearly see the dark red blood streaming out from the straw and into the spider\u2019s mouth.On the ground of this hillside cave, were various bones of all different types of beasts piled up like mountains. One could only imagine the amount of time the Demonic Spider Beast had spent living here and the number of poor souls, humans and animals alike, that had fallen prey to it.Kai Yang had no time to spare to think about this spider\u2019s capabilities and form an appropriate plan. Every second he delayed, increased the chances of this little boy ascending straight to heaven. After a moments silence, he suddenly charged forward.The enormously, large, flower patterned spider did not expect to be disturbed at that moment. Shortly after Kai Yang charged forward, a large amount of force was applied to the side of the Demonic Spider, and a large hole was torn in the web. The flower patterned spider fell alongside Kai Yang. The little boy also fell through the hole and onto the ground.Being attacked so suddenly caused the flower patterned spider to be furious. It\u2019s eight long, hairy legs stamped the ground, and all of its eyes focused on Kai Yang.Before he even had to time to get up, he was pinned down by a single single pounce from the flower patterned spider.Kai Yang snarled, a steel fist flew out and landed squarely on the throat of the spider. This momentarily stunned it, Kai Yang took the opportunity to kick the spider, sending it flying away.With a single roll, Kai Yang got to his feet and crouched down, his eyes fully focused on the movements of that flower patterned spider.After that small confrontation, Kai Yang\u2019s furiously beating heart had calmed slightly. For that demonic beast\u2019s rank was not that high, otherwise he would even be able to struggle against it. It\u2019s most likely that it\u2019s only a first realm demonic beast.However even if it was only a first realm demonic beast, given Kai Yang\u2019s current strength it was still a difficult opponent.As both sides were sizing up their opponents, the flowered patterned spider started to show signs of impatience, and it wasn\u2019t just him Kai Yang began to exhibit them as well.It seemed that the little boy had lost too much blood, and was showing signs of poisoning. If the current situation could not be resolved quickly, then there would be no time to save him.Abruptly, the flower patterned spider opened its mouth to spit out a long, gem-silk thread. It spat the thread towards Kai Yang, signalling the start of its attack.Previously, Kai Yang had learnt about this thread\u2019s durability, so naturally he was wary to not be trapped by it. At once, he rolled to the side and narrowly dodged the attack.The flower patterned spider didn\u2019t show much reaction to his dodge and continued to spit out other thread pieces. By the time Kai Yang noticed the spider wasn\u2019t aiming at him it was already too late, the entire cave had been covered by in a web of these threads, sealing off his exits and trapping him inside.\u201cIs it forcing me to fight to the death?\u201d Kai Yang laughed at that thought, any fear he had previously harboured was quickly expelled by the arrogance seeping out from his bones, pumping adrenaline through his body.With the current situation, if he didn\u2019t kill the spider, he would not be able to leave. Since it had come to that, he could only fight to the bitter end; either you die or I die.With time ticking, Kai Yang could not afford to delay. Firmly planting both feet on the ground, he sprinted towards the flower patterned spider. Out flew another strand of thread, fortunately Kai Yang was on guard, so how could he not avoid it?After dodging three of these threads in succession, he had finally closed the distance between them. But before he could throw out a punch, that flower patterned spider raised its front two legs and drove them towards him.Kai Yang could only lift up his arm to block, the spider\u2019s forelimbs pierced through his arm.Kai Yang roared out in pain, his blood boiled out. Not only was he not in a fearful panic, instead he had an indescribable feeling of excitement and anticipation in his heart. All of his bones clanking together caused a warm feeling passed through his entire body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 \u2013 Good men will be rewardedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThrowing out a punch, Kai Yang\u2019s fist whistled through the air and smashed into the eyes on the left hand side of the flower patterned spider\u2019s head. The moment his fist hit, it pulverised two eyes.The flower patterned spider was horrified. Even with its limited intellectual capacity, it knew to fear that human with blood dripping from their arm. When it went to retract its two legs that were lodged in Kai Yang\u2019s arms, the spider found that the arm muscles had tightened around its forelimbs so the spider couldn\u2019t pull them out.Kai Yang\u2019s second punch followed shortly after his first, pulverising another two eyes.The flower patterned spider screeched out in pain, incessantly trying to retreat, but it\u2019s hind legs could only scratch at the ground. In desperation, it lashed out at Kai Yang, leaving many shallow wounds on his arms. Although they weren\u2019t deep, they still drew blood.But, the pain only served to increase Kai Yang\u2019s excitement, his whole body bubbled with overflowing strength. The corners of his mouth curved into a cold and merciless smile, his fists flew endlessly towards the spider\u2019s forehead. Under the unceasing barrage of attacks, the flower patterned spider\u2019s forehead cracked open, and its bodily fluids oozed out.A dismal whimper escaped from its mouth, the flower patterned did not wish to sit and wait for its death. From its mouth, it spat out streams of its web, and at such close proximity, the web wrapped Kai Yang up.However at that moment, the flower patterned spider was in a horrible state; its head was disfigured so much that it had nearly burst. If it hadn\u2019t become a demonic beast, and gained the tenacious vitality that is associated with it, it would have already died many times over.Since this was the case, even though it had trapped him with its web, under Kai Yang\u2019s relentless fists, it soon ceased all signs of struggling.Kai Yang would have never imagined he could win a fight with a demonic beast. Furthermore, not only had he survived, he had also killed it.Even though it was a first realm demonic beast, it was still not something a cultivator at the tempered body fifth stage should be able to defeat. Although Kai Yang\u2019s wounds weren\u2019t considered light, he didn\u2019t feel much pain from them; as if they nothing at all.After certifying that the flower patterned spider was truly dead, Kai Yang went to extract the leg that had pierced into his arm. When he pulled it out, a gush of warm blood followed.(TL: O.O, you just casually pulled something that was stabbed into your arm? Oh it\u2019s stuck, let\u2019s pull it out.)Without even pausing to inspect his injuries, Kai Yang tore apart the spider web that was binding him and rushed to the little boy\u2019s side; gently cradling his body he brought him out of the cave.The little boy\u2019s father had managed to finally escape from his web cocoon. And just as he was preparing to run further into the cave, he saw a blood-drenched Kai Yang carry out his son. He quickly inquired: \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d\u201cHe has lost too much blood and has also been poisoned.\u201d Kai Yang replied.After reaching the cave\u2019s entrance, Kai Yang placed the little boy onto the ground and raced towards his fallen bag. Taking out some of the herbs inside, he began chewing on them. Without hesitation he called over the hunter: \u201cChew on these herbs to soften them, then feed them to him.\u201dThe hunter was already scared out of his wits, so when he heard Kai Yang\u2019s orders, he didn\u2019t hesitate. Swiftly, he placed the herbs into his mouth and began to chew them diligently.In that moment, Kai Yang\u2019s mind was all too clear; his understanding of each herb\u2019s medicinal properties began to appear in his mind within his mind. Which herbs could detoxify, which herbs could help with healing, which herbs could help staunch blood flow, the knowledge flowing through his mind was comparable to that of a veteran pharmacist.After a short period of time, Kai Yang took out the herbs he had been chewing on and smeared them over the little boy\u2019s arm. The hunter followed his actions and began to feed the chewed up herbs to his son.Under the nervous gazes of the two people, colour gradually returned to the boy\u2019s pale face and his breathing steadied.The hunter could finally release the tension in his heart and fell on his buttocks. Crying out loudly he said: \u201dFortunately nothing happened, fortunately nothing happened\u2026\u2026..\u201dKai Yang poured cold water on his new found hope: \u201cNot yet, my herbs are only low levelled ones and can only alleviate his symptoms.You have to leave the mountain and find a doctor, otherwise I\u2019m afraid that the poison will become incurable. \u201dThe hunter could only listen to Kai Yang\u2019s advice. Immediately he said: \u201cThen I shall go take him to find a doctor now.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no hurry.\u201d said Kai Yang as he held out his hand to stop him. \u201cAllow your son to stabilise first then move him.\u201d\u201cOh, what the saviour says is correct.\u201d With such a great catastrophe befalling on the hunter, he had long since lost his nerve. So whatever Kai Yang said, he would follow.After replying, he remembered that his saviour was also injured. His injuries were not light, so he worriedly asked: \u201cSaviour, do you not want to also treat your own wounds.\u201dKai Yang replied: \u201cNot need.\u201d\u201cBut you have shed such a large amount of blood, how is that alright?\u201d The Hunter looked at him in shock.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Standing up, Kai Yang jumped up and down vivaciously. \u201cEven I don\u2019t know, but I feel great.\u201dHe not only felt great, but also excited. Kai Yang suspected all this was somehow related to his golden skeleton, but how could he explain it to a simple hunter? As he thought back to the recent fight, Kai Yang\u2019s blood began to boil once again.That was the very first time he had ever been in a life or death situation. But he had not experienced even the slightest amount of fear, instead he had only felt enjoyment at the feeling of blood splattering all around him. Like it was the most common occurrence.(TL: The birth of an asura/bloodthirsty demon/demon king???)\u201cThat\u2019s right, please wait a bit. I will return soon.\u201d As he picked up his bag, Kai Yang once again rushed into the cave.The hunter thought he had gone to sort out the demonic beast\u2019s corpse, but that was not it.Although the flower patterned spider was a demonic beast, it\u2019s corpse didn\u2019t hold any value; it was too low levelled.Kai Yang\u2019s goal was to pick herbs growing inside the cave!Before he had begun his battle with the flower patterned spider, he had discovered a large amount of purple coloured flowers. Previously he didn\u2019t have the time to examine them, but now that he thought back to them, his spirits couldn\u2019t help but rise.If he didn\u2019t see incorrectly, those purple coloured flowers were actually the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flowers that he desperately needed.(TL: here comes his xianxia luck!!!!)Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flowers grew in dark and damp places with a lot of corpses. Making this cave an ideal environment for them to grow in.With his heart full of anticipation as he entered the cave, Kai Yang nearly laughed, such was his joy.Helping others will really reward you well. It seemed that this saying was true! If he had not come to rescue the father and son pair, then he would never have found the herbs that he was looking for.The vast expanse of purple flowers in front of him truly were the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flowers. Plus, there appeared to be a vast quantity of them; a quick count showed there were at least thirty to forty of these flowers. These small purple flowers, all bunched together would make anyone who saw them feel delighted.Without further ado, Kai Yang hurriedly took out his shovel and started to harvest these herbs.While he busied himself, Kai Yang\u2019s heart was more than content. Just as he was preparing to leave the cave, Kai Yang discovered a red, mushroom like plant in the corner of the cave.His curiosity piqued, Kai Yang walked towards it to carefully examine it. This thing was about the size of a bowl, dark red and was like a mushroom or fungus. Kai Yang didn\u2019t recognise this thing, for it was not mentioned in the little book that Treasurer Meng had given him.Could it be a priceless treasure? Rolling up his sleeves, Kai Yang went to pick the mushroom like plant. As for the matter of its identity, he could work it later; it wouldn\u2019t take much space up anyway.By the time Kai Yang exited the cave, his bag was filled to the brim.\u201cLet\u2019s go, I will descend the mountain with you.\u201d Kai Yang told the the hunter, treating him like an equal.\u201cMany thanks to the saviour.\u201d The hunter was moved to tears, for he knew that Kai Yang was worried they would encounter more danger on the journey out. That\u2019s why he was following them.\u201cWe just happen to be travelling the same path, no need for thanks.\u201d Kai Yang replied humbly, and the three of them quickly descended the mountain.By evening they had arrived back at town, and in the dark, they searched for the doctor\u2019s home.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 \u2013 Su Mu comes, looking for troublePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEven after settling the little boy, Kai Yang wasn\u2019t in a rush to leave. Afterall, that night, the little boy had given him some of his rations. So he had to stay until the boy opened his eyes; only after that would his heart be at peace.Inside, the hunter was paced around restlessly, worried about his boy. Before long, the doctor shooed him out \u2014 saying he was too noisy.\u201cDoctor Chu said it is fortunate we did some emergency treatment. Otherwise my son would have truly lost his life. Saviour, your mercy and kindness I will be forever unable to repay. Even if I worked hard my entire life, I will be unable.\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, the hunter knelt down in front of Kai Yang.Kai Yang did not help him up but smiled and said: \u201cBig brother Zhang, men only kneel before gold. With you kneeling, you have harmed our good relationship, you do not need to kneel in the future. I also ate some of your child\u2019s rations, if you are talking about owing, then I owe you too.\u201dAfter finishing his sentence, he went to help hunter Zhang up.Hunter Zhang was moved to tears: \u201cSaviour, you truly are a good person!\u201dAs they were speaking, the doctor walked outside and said to hunter Zhang: \u201cIt is no longer dangerous, so you need not worry. But because he has lost a large amount of blood, he will be asleep for a while longer but once he wakes up, he\u2019ll be fine.\u201dWhen they heard those words, Kai Yang and hunter Zhang both let out sighs of relief.Once he relaxed Kai Yang felt a wave of exhaustion flow through his body. Today had been far too exciting, he had also received many wounds and lost a lot of blood. Even with his previous energy, his body had still received damage, so when he relaxed himself, he fell asleep; sleeping until the sun rose.Early in the morning, Sky Tower.Many of the disciples woke up early, with high spirits. Together they gathered in a certain region, waiting in anticipation. Thirsty eyes, craned necks, a unruly state of mind; these things were consistent throughout the crowd. Together they surrounded the house like a housewife who had waited many years for her husband to return home. Exemplifying that devotion and expectation.With the passing of time, the number of people who gathered gradually increased. It was like they were telepathically connected, everybody turned their heads at the same time to look at one place.That place was the path that lead to the residence of Kai Yang, a small little hut.Today was the day when they could once again challenge Kai Yang! This was equivalent to a free contribution point box, how could these disciples give up this golden opportunity? Some people pitied Kai Yang\u2019s predicament, for every five days he was challenged and beaten to a pulp. This was really a bit too brutal.However sympathy alone could not help Kai Yang. Even if they did not challenge him, many others would gladly take their place. In the end, he will still be beaten to a pulp, so they might as well do it themselves, at least they could take it easy on him. When they thought about it like that, they all came to try their luck.En, if he chose me, I will definitely hit lightly, so he will not be injured too badly. Many people were making excuses like this in their hearts.Typically Kai Yang was already awake and had begun to sweep the area by this time, but it was really strange today. Even after waiting quite a while, they still had not seen Kai Yang. Even when they tiptoed over to look around, they could not find him.\u201cWhat\u2019s with Kai Yang? Did he oversleep? How come he has yet to come out?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, thinking about it, has anyone has seen him in these past few days?\u201d\u201cCould it be that he has already left Sky Tower?\u201d\u201cImpossible, it\u2019s not like you don\u2019t know about Kai Yang\u2019s stubbornness. Even if you killed him, he would not leave. If he really wanted to leave, he would have left a couple months ago, when he was made into a trial disciple. Why would he wait such a long time just to leave in the end anyway?\u201dSurprisingly with all the discussion going on, no one knew that a few days prior, Kai Yang had asked for leave to enter the Black Wind Mountains and had yet to return. Though this was no surprise, for during normal days, Kai Yang did not interact much with others, and so naturally no one knew of his whereabouts.While this group were making a ruckus, a person had started to walk towards this crowd. His face was flawless like jade, and his body also like jade, he really was a handsome youth. But no one knew why at that moment, this youth\u2019s expression was very gloomy. As he walked, he was gnashing his teeth and cursing someone.Following behind this youth, were a large number of Sky Tower disciples. Surrounding him, they made him the centre of attention.While the youth was surrounded he showed a very unpleasant face. He said in doubt: \u201cWhy is it? Why are there so many people here?\u201dIn response to his request someone hurriedly came up to him and informed him in a lowered voice: \u201cMaster Su, today is the day when we can challenge Kai Yang. So many fellow disciples have gathered here today to collect some contribution points.\u201dThe youth that was called Master Su furrowed his eyebrows before laughing heartedly. \u201cLooks like our fellow disciple Kai Yang is in an abyss of suffering.\u201dHis words were full delight at Kai Yang\u2019s misfortune.\u201cEn. Basically he is challenged every five days. Not only that, he will not admit defeat unless he can no longer stand properly.\u201d The person who had spoken earlier further explained.Master Su laughed again: \u201cEn, this young master feels that the resentment in his heart has decreased greatly. But this is not enough, I must make him leave Sky Tower. For as long as he is not a Sky Tower disciple I can do whatever I please with him and no one can say a word.\u201d\u201cMaster Su is right. That brat dared to tarnish your good name, he really cannot differentiate between a noble and a horse. He doesn\u2019t even bother to inquire as to Master Su\u2019s identity. He is too arrogant!\u201dThis ass-kissing made Master Su feel much better, causing him to repeatedly nod his head.Master Su, whose reputation Kai Yang had tarnished, was exactly the same Su Mu he had met in Black Plum Village. It was the same Su Mu, along with the two Han men, upon whom Kai Yang had enforced justice. Because of this, Su Mu had flown into a rage, enquiring around Sky tower on the identity of Jai Yang.In the end, he had found out about the ins and outs about Kai Yang in less than a day. Afterall, he did have his own network of connections and channels. But under the iron rule of the Main Gate, he could not easily move his hand and had waited until this day to bring a bunch of people over to cause trouble for Kai Yang. Unfortunately he didn\u2019t expect that so many other people would also come for Kai Yang.This made Su Mu somewhat displeased, Waving his hand, he said: \u201cMake them leave. Tell that today, Kai Yang will only be mine today.\u201dThis statement made Kai Yang sound like some sort of young girl, or like an available prostitute, ready to be brought.The person next to him promptly walked into the crowd, cupped his hands and said: \u201cFellow disciples, today\u2019s battle with Kai Yang, Master Su has already reserved it. So I ask my fellow disciples to please line up at the door and watch. I am sorry any inconvenience.\u201dThis announcement took many by surprise. They all turned to Su Mu in confusion and asked: \u201cWhy should we? Everytime, Kai Yang would use his broom to choose the opponent, so for what reason should we allow you to fight him? Even if he did not choose, shouldn\u2019t it be first come, first served?\u201dAfter that was said, someone pulled at the speaker and whispered to them: \u201cThat is Su Mu. Do you know who Su Mu is?\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d This person had just been accepted, so he really didn\u2019t know who Su Mu was.\u201cIdiot! There is an Elder who is surnamed Su, there is also a core disciple within the top ten surnamed Su. Why don\u2019t you say who he is?\u201d That person spoke.Although the one listening didn\u2019t nod his head in understanding, he still understood the meaning behind those words. He had been temporarily stunned by the information. When he heard that Su Mu had such powerful people backing him, how could he dare make another sound?\u201cWinning against Kai Yang will not even earn me many contribution points, so it\u2019s best not to offend him.\u201d\u201cYes yes yes.\u201d The person replied while cold sweat dripped down his back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 \u2013 Burn the housePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySu Mu was very satisfied with the reaction to his demand, but witnessing this made him snort softly in disdain.Although today\u2019s battle with Kai Yang had been secured by Su Mu, the crowd had yet to disperse. They didn\u2019t know what Kai Yang had done to offend Su Mu, so of course they wanted to stay behind and watch the show.After waiting for some time, Kai Yang still hadn\u2019t appeared. Su Mu impatiently asked: \u201cWhere is he?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Usually, he is already out sweeping the grounds by this time, so I don\u2019t why he has yet to come out. Master Su, should we check his hut?\u201dAfter thinking for a bit, Su Mu nodded and replied: \u201cThat\u2019s a good idea. He is just a small and insignificant sweeper, yet he dares to make this Master Su painstakingly wait for him. I will make him pay for this later!\u201dThe location of Kai Yang\u2019s residence was no secret, so the people around Su Mu swiftly lead the way.The ones who had stayed behind to watch the show also followed, creating a grand procession of disciples.A short while later, the procession of people had arrived at Kai Yang\u2019s small hut. When they saw the pitiful and wretched state of his hut, with holes littering the hut walls, they were not surprised. For no apparent reason, Su Mu lifted his hand pointed at the hut: \u201cThat brat lives here?\u201d\u201cIn response to Master Su\u2019s question, because Kai Yang is a trial disciple, he must provide for all his own clothing, food, housing and training materials. The Main Gate will definitely not provide them for him. This hut was probably built by his own hands.\u201d\u201cGood good good.\u201d Su Mu laughed happily. Thinking about how drenched Kai Yang would become on rainy days elevated his spirits.Sighing, Su Mu controlled his smile and strode confidently, like a dragon or a proud like tiger, forward. With a loud voice, taking care to clearly articulate each word he called out: \u201cYou, Kai Yang. Get your arse out for this Master Su and prepare to receive a nice beating!\u201dThat loud shout was powerful, like a storm and yet unlike a storm it was not detached and uncaring it was filled with utter hatred.The hatred and bloodthirsty desire, made everyone present shiver in their shoes. This clearly displayed the level hatred between Kai Yang and Su Mu to the crowd, evidently it was not a small issue.Su Mu stood their, exuding a majestic presence, in this moment it appeared that not even the eight winds could move him. After he finished shouting, he waited expectantly outside the door for Kai Yang to coming running out, while pissing his pants, and crying to beg for mercy. The more he thought about it, the more arrogant be became.But no matter how long he waited, there was not a even a hint of movement within the hut.Su Mu\u2019s face was now full of rage, snarling he called out again: \u201cKai Yang, be a smart one and get your arse out here. Otherwise we will come inside and drag you out.\u201dYet, there was still no reply.Su Mu now felt there was something odd, for if Kai Yang was really inside, there should be at least sounds of him breathing. Could it be that he was not inside?Su Mu signalled one the people around him exaggeratedly. That person promptly sprang forward, forcefully kicked down the wooden door and rushed into the small hut.Not long after they had entered, that person ran out again and reported to Su Mu: \u201cMaster Su, there is no one inside. There is also a small accumulation of dust. Looks like this trash knew that a calamity was approaching, so had fled already.\u201d\u201cFled?\u201d Su Mu nearly vomited blood in anger. He had racked his brains, scheming for many days all in preparation for this day, the day he would get to exact his revenge and make up for the shame he suffered at the hands of Kai Yang. He had even brought many disciples to come and watch the show, yet that Kai Yang had unexpectedly fled?This was like a powerful punch had been let out, but landed on a piece of cotton. It made Su Mu feel gloomy and depressed.\u201cSpeaking about it, these past fews, we haven\u2019t seen even a hair of Kai Yang.\u201d\u201cA wise man will submit to the circumstances. Since Kai Yang had offended this Su Mu, he probably knew that all hell would break loose. Forcing him to leave the Main Gate.\u201d\u201cNo wonder even after waiting such a long time, he had yet to appear.\u201d\u201cAh! Now that Kai Yang has left, we will no longer be able to obtain easy contribution points.\u201dThe crowd muttered softly, none of their mutterings escaped Su Mu\u2019s ears.Although he was pleased by the respect they were showing him, he hadn\u2019t been able to extract his revenge. Thus Su Mu\u2019s heart was still unsatisfied.After thinking for awhile, with a gloomy face, Su Mu could only accept the fact he would not get to extract his revenge on Kai Yang today. In a fit of rage he said: \u201cThat trash really got lucky, however my anger will not dissipate, I will get something. Burn down this pitiful hut.\u201dThis demand alarmed everybody present, even the people Su Mu had brought with him were stunned. One asked: \u201cMaster Su, is it a good idea to start a fire inside the school?\u201d\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d Su Mu eyed him: \u201cEven if the sky falls down, I will be there to catch it. Furthermore, it isn\u2019t even important to the school. So what if it is destroyed, it wouldn\u2019t be much of a loss. Also, leaving this ragged hut standing will harm this younger master\u2019s eyes.\u201dHearing him say that, dispelled the concerns within their hearts. With the Master Su as backing them, burning this hut is nothing.Before they lit the fire, some went to look for dry grass to use as kindling.After awhile, everything was prepared. Grinning, Su Mu lit a torch, its flames distorted his face greatly making him appear evil?.\u201cKai Yang, I warn you never to let me see your face in the future. Otherwise I will not let you live or die!\u201d Su Mu said while grinding his teeth. Just as he was preparing to throw the torch into the hut, a person to his side tapped his shoulder and whilst releasing a bloodthirsty aura enquired of him: \u201cWhat is this for?\u201dSu Mu didn\u2019t even need to think before replying: \u201cBurning a house.\u201d\u201cWhy are you burning my house?\u201d That person\u2019s voice carried a hint of anger.\u201cYour house?\u201d Su Mu curled his lip ferociously and turned his head. As soon as he saw the speaker, he immediately jumped to the side like a frightened rabbit seeing a wolf. Then with an exaggerated movement, he assumed a defensive posture. His face was filled with alarm and the hairs on the back of his neck all rose.It was because the appearance of the person who had spoken was too frightening. Not only were his clothes all tattered, his hair was messed up, with plants sticking out all over the place and dirty beyond compare. His body also displayed numerous bloody marks, his clothes were bloodstained and a bulging bag was tied around his back. God only knew what was in there.A gentle breeze blew past, causing his tattered pants to flap revealing a strong and sturdy leg covered in leg hair.The wind carried with it the stench from Kai Yang\u2019s several dirty body, Su Mu was unable to stomach that smell. That appearance, coupled with the blood and smell made Su Mu want to vomit up his three meals.That posture, that manner, was strangely familiar.If he were to hold a broken bowl in one hand, then he would look exactly like a beggar.But\u2026\u2026.why did he feel that this horrifying person looked familiar?Su Mu looked more closely, becoming more and more confused. After he thought for a while he cried out: \u201cKai Yang!\u201dIf it\u2019s not Kai Yang, then who could it be? Even though his body shape had changed and his face was covered in filth, how could Su Mu, who hated Kai Yang deep down in his bones, not recognise him? If he could he not recognise him then who could?Kai Yang also recognised Su Mu. Grinning widely, he revealed a set of ivory white teeth. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t fellow disciple Su who brazenly tried to frame others in Black Plum Village?\u201dThe voice that said so was full of ridicule, turning Su Mu\u2019s white face a deep red. Stamping his foot Su Mu retorted: \u201cKai Yang, you did not choose to walk the path to heaven but chose to walk through hell\u2019s gates! You are destined to die today!\u201d\u201cYou want to find issue with me?\u201d His brow creasing, Kai Yang asked.\u201cNonsense!\u201d Su Mu cried proudly. \u201cYou thought I came to see you?\u201d\u201cIf you have something to settle with me, come and find me. Why do you need to burn down my house?\u201d Kai Yang questioned.Su Mu promptly threw the touch away and rushed to step on it; like he was stamping on Kai Yang directly. Venting on the torch, after a while, the torch was finally stamped out.This moment of pause allowed the people present to understand what was happening. They finally realised that Kai Yang had not run away from fear of Su Mu, but rather that he had only left to complete some business.But what business did he have to complete which had caused his appearance to become so appalling? Such bloodiness, isn\u2019t it a bit too much? Also the tears in his clothes were obviously made by some sort of sharp weapon. Who did he go and fight with? And was it a life and death type of fight?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21 \u2013 I will give you three movesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThose bloody wounds naturally came from the fight with the flower patterned spider. Back then he didn\u2019t have enough time to treat them, because he had to bring the little boy back to the village to see a doctor and then he had collapsed from exhaustion and immediately fallen asleep once he knew the child was safe.Kai Yang had slept until the next morning without waking. And after he saw that the little boy was awake and well, Kai Yang had hurried back to the Sect. When he drew near, he saw a hoard of people surrounding his home. They all held torches and looked like they were going to burn down his home. But how could he allow this? Naturally he would go and ask why they were doing this, but he didn\u2019t expect it would be Su Mu who came to look for trouble.Just as the owner of the house appeared, Su Mu who had intended to burn it down, did not even feel the tiniest bit guilty. Instead he felt excited and pointed towards Kai Yang: \u201cKai Yang, don\u2019t you dare say that this young master did not give you a chance. So if only you will\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWait a moment.\u201d Kai Yang lifted his hand to stop him, and then leisurely entered his hut.\u201cHey\u2026\u2026..\u201d With his words stopped halfway, Su Mu felt like he ate a fly; the ones that liked to appear before dung piles. He felt extremely uncomfortable.\u201cMaster Su, this person doesn\u2019t give one face at all.\u201d Someone cried out seeking justice for Su Mu.\u201cHumph!\u201d Sneering Su Mu said: \u201cLater, help me beat him ruthlessly, for I heard that this brat never surrenders. So no need to be soft with your strikes. Today, I must teach him the consequences for offending this young master.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhen he entered his hut, Kai Yang took off the bag on his back. Inside this bag were herbs, his precious harvest from the three days he spent on the mountain. If he didn\u2019t secure their safety first, his heart wouldn\u2019t be at rest.When he put the bag safely away, Kai Yang exited his hut and said to Su Mu with a serious face: \u201cWhat was it that you wanted to tell me?\u201dSu Mu looked at him, his face a picture of abhorrence. His face full of bitterness, like he was going to spit out a mouthful of blood.Previously, before he could say his perfectly rehearsed lines, he had been interrupted by Kai Yang. But now that Kai Yang had asked him what he wanted to say, he couldn\u2019t wait and yelled out: \u201cKai Yang, don\u2019t you dare say that his young master did not give you a chance. So as long you are willing to kneel down and kowtow for me in front of all the fellow disciples present and call me your grandfather, I will spare your life! Or else\u2026\u2026.humph, humph, humph\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe message was very clear, explicitly implying the threat unsaid.When he finished, Su Mu\u2019s face was filled with his desire for revenge; it really showed how he felt about Kai Yang.Slowly Kai Yang nodded his head, grievingly he looked at Su Mu.\u201cWhat?\u201d Su Mu was unsure, for Kai Yang\u2019s face was calm and composed. This made him somewhat restless, for he had been played around with by him before in Black Plum Village. He was still a bit traumatised from the experience.\u201cUnfilial!\u201d Kai Yang sighed.The crowd was stunned, Su Mu was stunned, they were all thinking how was this unfilial?\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Su Mu viciously asked.\u201cIsn\u2019t clear? Let me teach you!\u201d With a face of good intent, Kai Yang earnestly said: \u201cLet me ask you, do you have elders in Sky Tower?\u201d\u201cLooks like you really do have eyes!\u201d This made Su Mu\u2019s tail rise up into the heavens.Kai Yang smiled. For it was just like he guessed; Su Mu had someone to back him up. Otherwise how would he dare to act so brazenly as to burn his house.\u201cYour elder must have no small amount of power within the Main Gate right?\u201d Kai Yang asked again.\u201cHe\u2019s an elder!\u201d Su Mu snorted out. \u201cI also have an older sister who is a core disciple! As long as she wishes for it, a single finger will be able to kill you!\u201dKai Yang understood, he had a general understanding about the ins and outs of Su Mu\u2019s character. Patting his back he said: \u201cThat\u2019s right, so unfilial!\u201d\u201cWhat is right or wrong?\u201d Su Mu was furious. He was pulled around in circles by Kai Yang and now his mind was a mess. And he still didn\u2019t know what he meant.\u201cSuch an easy affair and yet you still don\u2019t understand. How has your mind developed?\u201d His brow creasing, Kai Yang looked at Su Mu pitifully and patiently explained: \u201cWith your older sister\u2019s position, then she would be my senior. If I were to really call you that, then how would your older sister call you? Then what would that elder call you? Unfilial. How unfilial! If I were that elder, I would you lock you up in the Destitute Dragon Stream. So that in this life, you can\u2019t even dream about leaving it.\u201dSu Mu\u2019s entire body shook and his face paled. Destitute Dragon Stream is a region in Sky Tower that was the most frightening place in the entire school. In the hundreds of years since the school\u2019s founding, any disciple that was found to have broken rules or committed heinous crimes was thrown into that region and never seen again. As long as you were thrown in Destitute Dragon Stream, you were a dead man.Destitute Dragon Stream; these three words were well-known in the surrounding thousand of miles. It\u2019s infamy was spread far and wide.Su Mu wasn\u2019t afraid of Kai Yang, however those three words struck fear into his very soul.One of the people that Su Mu brought with him sensed something was off with Su Mu and hurriedly said: \u201cMaster Su, this brat\u2019s mouth is very sharp, making him this confident. The reason why we came today, was to help you vent your anger.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Regaining his senses, Su Mu shouted indignantly to hide his embarrassment: \u201cKai Yang, don\u2019t talk about nonsense. If you will not kneel down and beg for forgiveness, then this young master will make you wish that you were never born in this life.\u201dHis eyes glinting coldly, Kai Yang held up his fists: \u201cDisciple Su, why don\u2019t you come and exchange some blows with me?\u201dSu Mu replied in contempt: \u201cI would like to, unfortunately you don\u2019t live up to expectations. You are not qualified! This master is at the tempered body ninth stage!\u201dHearing this, Kai Yang understood. The Main Gate rules state that if you want to challenge other disciples, the level difference must not exceed more than three levels. Su Mu really couldn\u2019t duel Kai Yang, their level difference was far too large.This was also the reason why Su Mu had brought people over with him, they weren\u2019t just here to watch the show.With a face full of loathing, a cold smile, Su Mu tilted his head towards Kai Yang: \u201cEverybody, this Yang disciple has reached the tempered body third stage. So which brother here is willingly to fight him?\u201d\u201cTempered body third stage, what a high stage!\u201d Everybody roared in laughter, for none of them had entered earlier than Kai Yang. Yet which one of them was not higher than him?\u201cAllow me to Master Su, for my cultivation is within the limit. Though I am only at the tempered body fifth stage. It should be enough to play satisfy disciple Kai Yang!\u201d A disciple said while walking through the crowd and looking disdainfully at Kai Yang.Kai Yang looked back at him laughing; their information was already long outdated.If it were five days earlier, he really would be at the tempered body third stage, but it is now longer the same story.But of course, these types of things Kai Yang wouldn\u2019t publicise. To advance two stages in five days, this speed was far too strange, such a monstrous thing would only attract unwanted attention.A person who had come with Su Mu said: \u201cYang disciple, I am called Zhao Hu. You must remember who it was, that beat you today!\u201d\u201cI have remembered it.\u201d Kai Yang replied seriously.Looks like that Zhou Hu was intentionally trying to give Su Mu face thought Kai Yang. Walking to face Kai Yang, he exaggeratedly waved his fingers: \u201cYang disciple, in order to not allow you to say I didn\u2019t give you face, I will allow you three moves. As long as you can make me take one step, it will be your victory. If not, please don\u2019t think of this disciple\u2019s strikes as ruthless.\u201dThis act of provocation contained the red fruit of contempt. To Su Mu, who was watching this, his heartbeat quickened in anticipation. This child Zhao Hu, he really knew how to thoroughly humiliate others. His choice of words wasn\u2019t bad.Although the difference between the tempered body third stage and the tempered body fifth stage consisted of only two stages, there was a large gap between each stage. Between these those two stages, there was a gap as large as a river separating them. And the strength that could be released when comparing the two were on completely different levels, like heaven and earth for these low level practitioners.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How much strength did he have remaining to fight? Additionally he was very skinny and malnourished to begin with, easily allowing others to look down upon him.Practically everybody present believed that Kai Yang would be unable to escape the calamity today. Even Xia Ning Chang who was situated in a nearby tree felt the same way.Xia Ning Chang, who had become a Dark Hall disciple, had come once again to record the outcome of Kai Yang\u2019s battle.\u201cHow is this allowed. I cannot allow my fellow disciple to be disadvantaged.\u201d Kai Yang asked, hesitating slightly.\u201cThere is nothing to worry about.\u201d Insisted Zhou Hu. \u201cSince I became a disciple, allowing you these three moves is something I should do! Ha ha!\u201d\u201cOkay then.\u201d Kai Yang replied, looking somewhat reluctant: \u201cSince Zhou disciple said so, then this senior will not be impolite.\u201d\u201cBring it on!\u201d Zhou Hu bellowed loudly, while he steadied himself and planted his two feet firmly onto the ground. His body\u2019s muscles bulged and his blue veins popped out all over his body.On the other side, Kai Yang walked forward step by step, his thin arms and legs tensed. Zhou Hu sneered internally and thought: \u2018Just with your weak physique, merely one breath from me and I will be able to blow you away. So what strength could you possibly reveal?\u2019Leisurely strolling forwards, Kai Yang walked up to Zhou Hu. He balled up his fist, slowly waved it in front of him. Smiling he cautioned: \u201cZhou disciple, I senior will now really hit you.\u201d\u201cCome then!\u201dJust as those words came out, Kai Yang\u2019s fist had already been released; striking right into Zhou Hu\u2019s abdomen.\u201cBang!\u201d That sound rang out, however none of the people present saw Kai Yang act; that fist which strangely hit Zhou Hu.As his face paled, Zhou Hu couldn\u2019t help but clutch his stomach and had to take a few steps backwards.\u201cBang!\u201d The second fist had already arrived before he could recover. It landed on his abdomen once again. Zhou Hu bent over clutching his stomach, as he felt his stomach acids rising up.\u201cPa!\u201d Kai Yang kicked out and hit Zhou Hu\u2019s chin. He cried out once before falling to the ground, motionless.He won!A great silence ensued, it was so quiet that you could have even heard a pin drop. One by one, everyone looked at Kai Yang, the shock apparent on their faces. Su Mu\u2019s eyes were especially wide, so wide that they looked like they were about to fall out of their sockets.Two punches, one kick was all it took to send Zhou Hu, who was at the tempered body fifth stage, flying away. Fu*k! Is this really the strength of someone who is at the tempered body third stage?Although from the start of the battle to the end, Zhou Hu did not retaliate, this power was far too much. A person who weighed about one hundred pounds was struck so hard he fly a few feet out. If you didn\u2019t exert some serious effort, how could this occur? Not to mention that speed was unparalleled. One moment Zhou Hu was smiling arrogantly, and the next he was unconscious.They could not believe the battle that had just occurred before their very eyes. Not to mention Xia Ning Chang, who was sitting in the tree and needed to record the battle.In her small book, it clearly stated that Kai Yang won the battle. In the past two years, he had been in one hundred and forty-seven battles and had lost them all. Unexpectedly he had changed this record today!He had also won the battle in a swift and efficient manner. Originally, Xia Ning Chang was gracefully standing on a branch, channelling her energy to balance herself. But due to the shock of his victory, she momentarily lost her concentration and fell off the branch, plummeting to the ground.A Masked female could be seen crashing down from a thirty foot high tree. As she fell butt first down to the ground, you could hear her screaming \u201cAi~ya!\u201d.Thankfully she had fast reflexes and an equally fast reaction speed. At the last moment she channeled some energy into her body to cushion the fall. Otherwise she would have come out with far more serious injuries. Though her buttocks still burned in pain causing her, muscles to tense; hot enough to make water steam.As she stood and enduring the pain,one could see her two beautiful legs shaking. Xia Ning Chang looked around nervously, but realised there was nobody present and released a sigh of relief.If this scene was seen by others, then she would have lost much face.Activating her internal energy, she dissapitated the pain on her bottom. Her eyes glinted, for Xia Ning Change could not wrap her head around Kai Yang\u2019s strength. He was just gone for a few days, so how did his strength increase this much?Those people who had witnessed the scene naturally could not be compared to Xia Ning Chang. Their cultivation was far lower than hers, so they couldn\u2019t see the truth of the matter.In that moment when Kai Yang had struck out, Xia Ning Chang clearly felt the atmospheric energy within Kai Yang\u2019s channels had been aroused. This clearly demonstrated that he was at least at the tempered body fourth stage, additionally it even looked like his actual strength surpassed this stage.But wasn\u2019t he only at the tempered body third stage a few days ago?That damn disciple! He unexpectedly hid his true strength, and not only did he give everyone a shock, he also made some fall out of trees. This was hateful to the extreme!Unconsciously, Xia Ning Chang had placed all the blame upon Kai Yang for her sore bottom.Kai Yang glanced over to the place where Xia Ning Chang was hidden. When she had fallen, Kai Yang managed to hear her short scream, but because the distance between them was too large he hadn\u2019t been able to spot her. Since he didn\u2019t find anything abnormal he didn\u2019t investigate further. He then wrinkled his eyebrows, as he looked down at his clenched fist, he felt somewhat unsatisfied.Of course Kai Yang was unsatisfied, for it was his very first battle with another human since he had obtained the golden body. Due to the fact that he hadn\u2019t controlled his strength properly, Zhou Hu was sent flying away. Originally he had only planned to send his opponent back a few steps, but it looked like his power was a bit greater than what he had imagined.At the scene, Su Mu was the first to recover. As he pointed his finger to Kai Yang, he yelled loudly: \u201cYou cheated!\u201dKai Yang turned around and calmly looked at Su Mu: \u201cSu Disciple, you can eat whatever you want to, but you cannot say words recklessly. When did I cheat?\u201dSu Mu was at a loss for words. It was true, when did he cheat? Zhou Hu had intentionally stood there and declared that he would take three strikes. Unexpectedly he was truly defeated in three moves. Under the numerous gazes of the crowd, how could he possibly cheat? How could he cheat?\u201cMaster Su, it seems that our information was not correct. This brat is not at the tempered body third stage! I\u2019m afraid that he has already ranked up, otherwise how could he possibly defeat Zhou Hu?\u201d Someone who had keen eyes and a shrewd mind quickly realised, whispering in Su Mu\u2019s ear.\u201cSo it was like this.\u201d Su Mu nodded, his face darkening. \u201cZhou Hu was too arrogant. If he had retaliated, how could he lose?\u201dIn Su Mu\u2019s mind, he thought that the reason why Zhou Hu lost was because he had underestimated his opponent. For he believed no matter how much Kai Yang ranked up, he would have only gone up to the tempered body fourth stage. With that large gap in mind, if Zhou Hu had retaliated, then Kai Yang would have been the one to be utterly defeated.\u201cBrother Kai Yang, you have done well to hide your strength!\u201d Su Mu said coldly and gloomily to Kai Yang. Today he had failed to extract his revenge, so the suffocating feeling within his heart was not goneKai Yang shrugged his shoulders.\u201cLet us settle the score later. Next time, you will not be so lucky!\u201d Su Mu coldly declared to Kai Yang. Then with a wave of his hand, he started to lead the people back, while also motioning for some to carry the unconscious Zhou Hu. But before he left, he directed one final bitter glare at Kai Yang.This enmity has been sealed for now, though Kai Yang didn\u2019t mind. In any case, in the Main Gate, there was only the Main Gate\u2019s rules. So if you wanted to cause any trouble, you could only do it in the form of duels.Moreover, he still needed to spar with others, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t know the true extent of his growth. With that in mind, Kai Yang thought that the feud between Su Mu and himself was a blessing disguise.Today\u2019s battle was not exciting enough, ah, Kai Yang was left feeling unsatisfied.With Su Mu gone, the entertainment gone, the crowd naturally dispersed. Though many of them still replayed the recent miracle in their minds, of that two year trial disciple Kai Yang. He had obtained his first victory. Although it was very fast, he had still won.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 \u2013 An incredible thingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNews of this battle was soon a hot topic between fellow disciples, with others seeking out those present to hear the details. If not for Su Mu\u2019s status, then the news would have long since been spread to the ends of the earth. However since Su Mu was involved, the disciples could only hide it within their stomachs, discreetly talking about it.In Kai Yang\u2019s small hut, it had finally calmed down.Looking at the sky, Kai Yang became depressed. Because Su Mu had come to cause trouble, he had lost precious time to practise the tempered body record. It was truly regrettable.Taking out his spare pair of clothes, Kai Yang then went to the small pond beside his hut. Taking off his tattered clothes, he prepared to take a bath. These past few days he had been wondering the mountain and then he had fought the flower patterned spider, these two things combined had really made him smell funny.Stealthily, Xia Ning Chang tip toed to the side of the hut, for she wanted to learn the true level of this fellow disciple. Yet when she turned the corner, all that met her eyes were a pair of white buttocks. Kai Yang had already become stark naked, not a stitch of clothing remained and he was in the position to dive into the water.Xia Ning Chang\u2019s small face immediately flushed a bright red. Although her cultivation was very high, she was still an innocent female. Not even mentioning buttocks, she hadn\u2019t even seen a male\u2019s thigh. How could she possibly endure this scene?Too provoking! Xia Ning Chang\u2019s heart had begun to thump erratically and she quickly hid herself.How\u2026. she today\u2026\u2026\u2026why did they have this fate? Tears streamed down that pitiful girl\u2019s face, there was no time to find out his secret. Stamping her foot, she disappeared in a flash.That stinking disciple. Those entrance examinations conducted by the teachers were too lax. Disciples stripping stark naked in broad daylight is too shameless. Far too shameless!In the pond, Kai Yang was washing his body and inspecting it.He had discovered that ever since he started to practise the tempered body record, his muscles had become sturdier and more robust. Although he was still thin, he was thin in the right places.Additionally, the wounds from yesterday\u2019s battle with the flower patterned spider had already become scars. Only the arm wound from the flower patterned spider\u2019s leg had yet to fully heal; it was still a bit painful.After all, it had penetrated through his arm, so it couldn\u2019t possibly heal that quickly. But it wasn\u2019t as severe as he had imagined, give it a few days and should be completely healed.Thinking over that life and death battle with the spider, caused Kai Yang to be excited. Not knowing why, the more dangerous the situation he was in, the more enthusiastic and excited he became. He unexpectedly had this type of character, was he unconsciously a masochist and after living a bit more than ten years, he had suddenly awakened?When he thought of that, he promptly inhaled a large breath and submerged himself in the pond; not resurfacing for awhile.Although there were many things for him to complete, Kai Yang still went to take a shower. After dressing himself, he began his sweeping.Afterall, this was his assigned work in Sky Tower. And since he was assigned this job, he must complete it to the best of his ability.While sweeping, Kai Yang clearly felt that the gazes from his fellow disciples were strange. They were full of doubt, for they were the ones who had witnessed his battler earlier in the morning. They didn\u2019t understand why Kai Yang had been able to knock Zhou Hu unconscious.Kai Yang calmly and honestly continued with his work.Completing his sweeping, Kai Yang returned to his wooden hut and opened his bag. From within, he took out the herbs he had collected, keeping the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass out and placing the other extra herbs back into the bag.These extra herbs were completely useless to Kai Yang, but he can sell them to the Contribution Hall for some contribution points.Wrapping up the herbs he started to leave before stopping. Thinking again, he went back and changed his clothes, wearing his tattered, bloodstained ones he also dirtied his face bit before leaving again.In the Contribution Hall, Treasurer Meng was sitting behind the counter while holding a teapot. Crossing his legs while sipping the tea he merrily hummed a tuned.Suddenly a human figure could be seen at the hall entrance. Old man Meng boredly lifted up his head to see, and just as he was about to scold that brat which dared to come here his eyes widened. So early in the morning and someone dared to disturb his peace and quiet. Yet when he saw Kai Yang battered and exhausted walking in. His tattered clothes which could no longer be considered clothes, his two legs were clearly seen, and so were his leg hairs.(TL: Yea, I\u2019m confused as you are, leg hairs\u2026\u2026O.o)The two female disciples at the entrance saw this and shrieked out in shock at this vagabond, quickly retreating.How was Treasurer Meng\u2019s self control? After entering the mountain, then descending into the seas, he would remain impassive. Even if there was a massacre of ten cities. Yet at that moment, he sprayed out his mouthful of tea; you could imagine the scene.\u201cLittle Kai Yang, what is with your appearance?\u201d Old man Meng nearly went into a frenzy, quickly standing up. Dumbstruck, he looked at Kai Yang.Rushing to the counter, Kai Yang then inhaled a large gulp of air before replying: \u201cI have returned!\u201d\u201cExperienced many hardships right?\u201d Treasurer Meng felt pity for Kai Yang. Just a few days ago when he had come to his place, he was still healthy, yet from a single trip to Black Wind Mountains, he had become like this. He was not like a human or even a ghost, this was too tragic.\u201cEn, I was in danger.\u201d Nodding his head, Kai Yang didn\u2019t waste anymore words. Hurriedly he opened up his bag and pointed to the herbs inside: \u201cBut my harvest was not bad, Treasurer Meng, will the Contribution Hall accept these herbs?\u201dLooking at the herbs, Treasurer Meng\u2019s eyebrows rose.They were only ordinary grade lower level herbs, and practically had no worth. These herbs were too plentiful in the Contribution hall, even if he accepted, there would be no place to put them.Just as he was about to reject the herbs, Treasurer Meng saw the expectation in Kai Yang\u2019s eyes and then looked again at his attire. Seeing this his hearten softened: \u201cOh, we will accept. For every two herbs I will give you one contribution point.\u201d\u201cOkay, then please count them.\u201d Without bargaining, Kai Yang pushed the bag forward.Treasurer Meng went to count the number of herbs. There were thirty-two herbs, a total of sixteen contribution points. Immediately he went to record this into his account book.\u201cYou were in Black Wind Mountains for an entire three days, yet you only found this much?\u201d Treasurer Meng causally asked.\u201cBeing able to obtain this is considered good.\u201d Kai Yang said while carefully looking around.\u201cKeke, it\u2019s not bad.\u201d Treasurer Meng couldn\u2019t bear to pour cold water on Kai Yang, after all he knew of the difficulties he faced. Although this child\u2019s natural aptitude was not good, he was willing to work hard. Nowadays, these types of hardworking youngsters are a rare sight. It\u2019s such a shame, his aptitude was so poor that it was a fatal downside, for it destined him to have no major achievements.As he was thinking about this, he saw how Kai Yang\u2019s eyes were darting around and couldn\u2019t help but ask he curiously: \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dMysteriously, Ki Yang leaned forward and said in a low voice: \u201cTreasurer Meng, in this trip to the mountain I seem to have found some incredible thing.\u201dSeeing Kai Yang\u2019s cautiousness, Treasurer Meng also felt that this thing was something uncommon. He also became more serious and said in a low voice: \u201cWhat thing?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I have brought it back to let you see it. You are experienced and knowledgeable, so you should definitely be able to recognise it.\u201d As he said this, he went to touch his butt and took out a another bag. Carefully he placed it on the counter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 \u2013 Earth Grade Lower Level Blood MushroomPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTreasurer Meng looked up and saw Kai Yang\u2019s face held both anticipation and nervousness. He couldn\u2019t help but become cautious too. Softly and gently he opened the bag, squinting his eyes at the contents inside.It was about the size of a bowl, dark-red coloured, shaped like a mushroom, like a fungus. It really looked unordinary, with a heaven and earthly type aura.\u201cKe\u2026\u2026.keke\u2026\u2026..\u201d Treasurer Meng couldn\u2019t help but cough a couple of times.Nervously Kai Yang looked at him and questioned him: \u201cWhat thing is this?\u201dTreasurer Meng looked at him queerly, and instead of replying, he asked: \u201cWhere did you find this?\u201d\u201cInside a cave in the mountain. There was also a first realm demonic beast guarding it. But instead of me being killed by it, it was killed by me, so I took it with me.\u201dTreasurer Meng\u2019s heart jumped out: \u201cYou met with a demonic beast? Didn\u2019t I tell you not to go past the safety boundary?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t go past the safety boundary. I didn\u2019t know why it was in the safe zone area around Black Wind Mountain either.\u201d Kai Yang replied in grievance.Treasurer Meng sighed, he had thought something like this must have happened. It was just he was afraid that with this child\u2019s strength, defeating a demonic beast, even one at the first realm must have been a very arduous task.This pitiful one, at such a young age he has already suffered so many untold hardships while in Black Wind Mountains for only three days. And this work had only earned him sixteen contribution points. He even met with a first realm demonic beast, an encounter in which he nearly lost his life. If he was to tell him that his thing was, this things was\u2026\u2026.ah this is too wrong, too wrong.Anyway, this old man rarely does a good deed, just think of it as karma.When Kai Yang saw Treasurer Meng\u2019s face changing, yet Treasurer Meng not replying, it made him somewhat anxious. Just as he was about to ask him again, Treasurer Meng picked up the teapot and drank from it. Afterwards, he squeezed out a smile and said: \u201cYou little brat, your luck isn\u2019t bad!\u201dAs soon as he heard this, the worry in Kai Yang\u2019s heart immediately dissipated. He was worried that when he went to ask, this thing would end up being worthless, that would have been embarrassing.\u201cTreasurer, what is this exactly? How many contribution points is it worth?\u201d Rubbing his hands together in expectation Kai Yang asked.\u201cOh\u2026\u2026\u2026this thing is called a blood mushroom! It is a rare medicinal ingredient, it is an ordinary\u2026\u2026..\u201d Before he finished what he was saying, he looked at Kai Yang\u2019s falling face and hurriedly went to correct himself. \u201cNo no no, it\u2019s an earth grade lower level herb. En, it\u2019s really earth grade lower level! That\u2019s right!\u201dSuch a firm tone was used that Treasurer Meng nearly fooled himself into thinking that it was true.\u201cEarth grade lower level?\u201d Kai Yang was pleasantly surprised: \u201cTreasurer Meng are you sure you didn\u2019t see incorrectly?\u201dStraightening his face, Treasurer Meng replied: \u201cYou must be joking. In this old man\u2019s life, he has inspected many women\u2026..keke, inspected many herbs. This pair of experienced and knowledgeable eyes, how could they possibly be wrong?\u201d\u201cHow many contribution points can it be exchanged for?\u201d Kai Yang was only interested in this.\u201cLet\u2019s make it twenty.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s so little.\u201d Kai Yang was somewhat disappointed. Even though its ranks wasn\u2019t that high, he thought it was at least high enough to make it worth at least twenty to forty contribution points.\u201cIt\u2019s not too little child.\u201d Treasurer thought to himself that he had given him too much already. He then found a good reason for this: \u201cEven though this blood mushroom that you found is an earth grade lower level herb, it is too small and its age isn\u2019t that high. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s only worth twenty contribution points.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Without refuting he accepted: \u201cThen twenty points it is.\u201dNodding his head, Treasurer Meng recorded down the transaction down in his account book again.This trip to the mountains had already satisfied his goal of obtaining the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass. Apart from that, it had earned him thirty-six contribution points. If he added his already obtained points, then he has a total of forty-eight contribution points. Kai Yang momentarily felt himself become rich and powerful.Although this trip into the mountains earned him quite the contribution points from the herbs, it had delayed and wasted precious time to cultivate. He had also needed luck to find the herbs and the whole trip had made him very tired. Kai Yang decided that other than as a last resort, he wouldn\u2019t do it again.(ED: How did it waste time to cultivate\u2026 he only needs to do it for 30 mins in the morning and he managed that just fine in the mountains\u2026..)The reason why he was collecting contribution points, was to aid him in his cultivation. Between these two things, contribution points and cultivation, Kai Yang still knew which was more important; he didn\u2019t lose sight due to greed.Now he has collected a decent amount of Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower. He had collected around thirty-forty of them in the cave, however the amount of Dead Jedi Tree Grass he had managed to collect was very small. He only had around five-six of them. If he really wanted to cultivate with them, then he must exchange some points for them at the Contribution Hall; he was well prepared for this.With his plan in mind, Kai Yang said: \u201cTreasurer Meng, please give me ten Dead Jedi Tree Grass herbs.\u201dOld man Meng looked at Kai Yang and wondered why he needed these herbs, however he didn\u2019t ask any questions. He only sat and stated: \u201cTen ordinary grade lower level herbs, ten contribution points. Are you sure you want them?\u201dScrunching up his eyebrows in suspicion, Kai Yang asked: \u201cThat\u2019s not right. Didn\u2019t you just say two herbs needed to be exchanged for one contribution point?\u201d\u201cThe buying price is the buying price, while the selling price is the selling price. They are not the same.\u201d Treasurer Meng smile was especially wide, the demeanor of a businessman was coming out.Furious, Kai Yang pointed towards Treasurer Meng\u2019s nose: \u201cYou are completely trying to buy at a low price and earn a profit. To reap a profit, this is too shameless. Did you let a dog eat your conscience?\u201dWaving his hand old man Meng replied: \u201cIt is not I who wants to reap a profit, but these are the prices assigned by the Main Gate. This is unrelated to me. All the prices within the Contribution Hall are unaffiliated with me, this old man is only in charge of selling and buying. How else do you think the Main Gate is able to provide for all three thousand of you disciples?\u201dKai Yang was stunned, for there was some sense in his words. Afterall this was a business, without any type of profit by Sky Tower, how could all three thousand disciples in the Main Gate survive? Even if there one were suspicious that it was for a profit, at the end of the day, no one was forcing you to buy them. No one was forcing you.\u201cThen, do you still want the Dead Jedi Tree Grass herbs?\u201d Seeing Kai Yang\u2019s face full of pain caused Treasurer Meng\u2019s mood to soar.\u201cI want them.\u201d declared Kay Yang, as he clenched his teeth together. Sooner or later he will need to use these herbs and since he had decided not to go find them in the mountain, he can only buy them.Turning around, Treasurer Meng went to the back hall and soon returned with the Dead Jedi Tree Grass. Kai Yang counted the number of herbs while Treasurer Meng recorded the transaction down.\u201cHumph!\u201d After eating such a big loss, Kai Yang turned around and immediately left the hall unhappy.\u201cPlease come again when you have time.\u201d Treasurer Meng called out warmly from behind.Come often to be killed by you. Kai Yang finally knew where Meng\u2019s nickname came from.Three steps, two steps, Kai Yang frantically rushed outside. On his way out, a figure rushing outside nearly crashed into him.These two people\u2019s reactions were fairly fast, Kai Yang stopped immediately and so did the other person. A sweet and pleasant fragrance drifted over to Kai Yang.Lifting his head, Kai Yang saw a pair of clear moon-like eyes staring at him, but he couldn\u2019t see her face clearly. This was because this person had their face covered with a veil.This was a female. Although he couldn\u2019t see her face, judging from her skin\u2019s condition, she wasn\u2019t very old. She was probably his senior.Nodding his head and apologising, Kai Yang then turned his body to the side; clearly signalling for her to enter first.The opposite party looked distracted and suddenly turned red. Seeing this made his own gaze become evasive.Seeing her flushed face, Kai Yang thought that this senior was quite shy. Swiftly he averted his gaze, as to avoid offending her.Xia Ning Chang was embarrassed to death.She didn\u2019t expect to bump into Kai Yang in front of the Contribution Hall. When she saw his face, she immediately thought of her\u2026\u2026And recalled his\u2026\u2026..Suddenly her face became red and her temperature rose. Hastily she rushed into the hall, she didn\u2019t even dare to lift her head up.Seeing this scene was somewhat laughable, for such shy females were quite rare. Although there are many females disciples in Sky Tower, they were martial practitioners and were therefore more open-minded than normal. For someone like her to become red just from looking at his face, it was no wonder she wore a veil.This senior was a little bit cute, it was just why was her body\u2019s fragrance vaguely familiar, like he had already smelled it before?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When she saw that Kai Yang had already left, she let out a sigh of relief, for she still felt a little bit guilty due to the morning\u2019s incident.While her feelings were in a mess, she heard Treasurer Meng let out an ai~o sigh from the counter.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter master?\u201d Xia Ning Chang asked.\u201cYou were just pitying that child.\u201d Treasurer Meng sighed out sobbingly. \u201cHe\u2019s a good child; willing to endure hardships, he\u2019s hardy, has a good personality, his character\u2019s not bad\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhen Xia Ning Chang heard the way her master was praising Kai Yang, she immediately grew angry. In her heart she thought that he had yet to learn of Kai Yang\u2019s actions this morning. Not only had he striped naked, he had also sullied this disciple\u2019s eyes and given this disciple of yours the fright of her life.On and on Treasurer Meng went, causing her to be more and more infuriated. Unable to bear it any longer, she slapped her hand onto the counter.\u201cPa!\u201d The sounded resounded like something had been broken.As he looked at her, his face contorted and he wailed out: \u201cThat was my earth grade lower level blood mushroom worth twenty contribution points\u2026\u201d\u201cThis was a blood mushroom?\u201d Looking at the already powdered mushroom on the counter top, Xia Ning Chang asked herself whether or not her master\u2019s eyes were failing. How is this a blood mushroom?\u201cIt\u2019s not, it\u2019s not. How could your master mistake it.\u201d Treasurer Meng replied as he let out a soft breath. The powder on the countertop then floated outside, like an invisible hand had scooped it up and scattered in the wind.\u201cOh that\u2019s right. Why did you come to find me today?\u201d Fixing his face, Treasurer Meng showed a rare face of solemnity.\u201cI broke through.\u201dHis expression changing, he went to inspect Xia Ning Chang\u2019s cultivation. Soon after he nodded: \u201cGood, good. It seems like I didn\u2019t see incorrectly, for only people of your physique are suited to this cultivation method. Come, eat this pellet to help stabilize your cultivation.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d After she took the pellet, Xia Ning Chang hesitated slightly before asking: \u201cHow is your injury?\u201dLaughing softly Treasurer Meng answered: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about your master. After so many years, there is not big hinderance.\u201dBrimming with anticipation and excitement, Kai Yang returned home to his small hut.Today the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass were all gathered and ready to be used. The amount of each was also not small, so it should last awhile.Now he had everything prepared, Kai Yang really wanted to verify, whether or not that incense burner could truly aid him in his cultivation.The location of the wooden hut was in the most empty and desolate area of Sky Tower, practically no one paid any attention to it. Since this was the case, Kai Yang didn\u2019t worry about having his secret exposed. Walking inside, he called out the black book and turned to page three. Then he extracted the incense burner and placed it on the bedside.He then took out the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass. Afterwards he stuffed them into the burner and put the lid back on.All of a sudden a faint scent, akin to a rare perfume started to disperse in the room. Breathing in deeply, Kai Yang began to analyse the perfume. Although the smell was a bit unique, there was nothing special about it.However, from the holes of the incense burner, the perfume steadily poured out and entered Kai Yang\u2019s nostrils. It was like small, snakes were purposely entering his body via his nose.Within his body, it was like there was something more. In his flesh and blood, in his meridians and even in his bone marrow a feeling of numbness spread.Kai Yang didn\u2019t dare tarry. Carrying the incense burner, he ran outside to begin his cultivation.Stepping out of his hut entrance into the light took him by surprise. For his foot felt like it was made of lead, it was far heavier than normal. In combination with this step, Kai Yang felt his strength rapidly decreasing.Taking another step, he began to feel dizzy and wanted to collapse; perspiring madly, his muscles tensed. The recently cultivated atmospheric energy in his meridians bubbled about and his bones cracked.Taking his third step out of his hut, his legs became soft and he fell to the ground. As he fell, Kai Yang\u2019s hands let go of the incense burner and it rolled far away.Hands on the floor supporting his body; immovable like a mountain, he gasped for breath. His chest heaved up and down as he took several deep breaths, his body continued twitched uncontrollably. His tendons, organs and bones expanded and contracted causing the pain to intensify as time past. Although Kai Yang wanted to howl in pain, he kept his mouth tightly shut.His current condition was one of excessive exhaustion; one he had experienced many times previously. Thus Kai Yang was quite familiar with it.But, he had only walked three steps out of his hut, so how did he exhaust all his energy? Not only was his physical stamina gone, his mental strength was also exhausted. It was like he had not slept for many nights, even his eyes had started to feel drowsy.At this point, his three energies were all exhausted to the limit, and he couldn\u2019t even move a single finger.By this time, the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass\u2019s side effects had started to take effect in Kai Yang\u2019s brain.The toxicity of these two herbs wasn\u2019t very strong. They were weak enough that normal people could resist them easily, but the prerequisite was that they were healthy. Given the hardships Kai Yang suffered daily combined with his current condition, Kai Yang had trouble withstanding them.He was afraid that inhaling the incense burner\u2019s perfume was the reason this type of situation had occurred. Though, regardless of the toxicity of the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass, such strong side effects was something they were unable to produce. The mystery originated from the incense burner; it was able to amplify those two herb\u2019s toxicity.Ever since he had obtained the golden body, every time he practised he never became tired or exhausted. And since he was never tired, Kai Yang was unable to reach his limits. Being unable to reach his limits, he was unable to improve.Though it appeared this was no longer the case anymore. He only took three steps, yet his all his strength had been consumed. But the effect of this incense burner was not as simple as enabling him to reach his limits at this stage, for in the future will there ever be any fear he wouldn\u2019t able to train to his limits again?Kai Yang always believed that a person\u2019s potential was unlimited, and the important thing was how one uncovered it. Although natural aptitude could help a person mature, one\u2019s own effort was crucial! So after all these years, even he knew his own talent was lacking, he diligently struggled and never gave up his drive to cultivate.Thinking this, Kai Yang\u2019s spirits were greatly lifted!Gradually and with much effort, he used his hand to push his exhausted body up; his thighs strained so much that his veins popped out. Gritting his teeth, he slowly pulled himself up.Almost all of his physical strength had been drained, his consciousness had started to become fuzzy once again. Yet his heart refused to give in, giving him a ferocious burst of strength and energy. In his entire life, he had never been this adamant about anything, he was adamant he would beat this!Stand up! For the place you fall, will also be the place from which you rise! If he stood up he would have broken through his limits, he would have won!Time had never flowed as slowly as it did now, both his feet had already been planted firmly on the ground. Legs slightly bent, fighting against the trembling, his desire to stand had not diminished in the slightest, he would do it even if it meant taking it as slow as possible.Finally Kai Yang bellowed/roared out, for he had finally stood up straight. Staggering forward, he steadied himself and anchored his feet to the ground.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 \u2013 An insignificant person goes for revenge all day longPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayKai Yang smiled at that moment. It seemed odd, after all both his physical and mental strength were exhausted and he could no longer see clearly. His ears were ringing and his head was throbbing very badly, yet he still laughed.\u2018I won! The sense of achievement that I feel right now is vastly greater than when I won against another person!\u2018Just when Kai Yang felt that he was going to faint, a warm feeling burst out from within his body. This warm feeling came from within his bones, like a spring rain that replenishes the fields after a drought, it blew through every part of his body. Through every inch of flesh, bringing with it a burst of vitality.His exhausted strength was quickly replenished; even his mental energy was revitalized to a certain extent. Although his energy didn\u2019t recover fully, it was enough to keep him from losing consciousness.Kai Yang didn\u2019t pause to revel in this feeling any further, but hurriedly sat down and analysed his current condition. This lead him to discover that the original numbing feeling from within his body had already disappeared without a trace. It left him with a comfortable feeling, it was so comfortable that it nearly made him cry out.His body pulsed rhythmically, and along with this, it was clear that it had become more robust and contained more explosive power than before. The atmospheric energy within his meridian pulsated incessantly; his bones also seemed to have become a lot sturdier.Just through this alone, his body had been strengthened by a large margin.This made him contemplative.Finally the last bit of warmth from his bones had seeped out; this was most likely from that golden body he had absorbed. After experiencing this several times already, Kai Yang had grasped the key information. Only when he had pushed his body to its limits, could he trigger the golden body\u2019s hidden powers.Though if he surrendered when he was in a predicament, that golden body would not give him any help.This really was the golden body\u2019s personality! Kai Yang chuckled lightly. Right now, he had finally understood how this incense burner could aid him in his training.The herbs that were put into the burner, their effects were multiplied hundreds of folds in strength. Then when he inhaled this incense, it made his strength rapidly decrease and also made him mentally tired. So much so that he could only take three steps before nearly fainting.Although these amplified herbal effects were tyrannical, they shouldn\u2019t have any long term negative side effects thought Kai Yang. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be able to the incense burner to assist in his training.But only when he overcomes his limits, and arouses the golden\u2019s skeleton\u2019s regenerative ability, will he be able to really benefit. Only then will he be able to constantly surpass his limit and grow stronger.The perfume that wafted out from the incense burner, served him well; just like that golden skeleton.Though these were all just assumptions on Kai Yang\u2019s part. But given the previous events, he felt this should be the truth. Next up, Kai Yang needed to closely analyse the incense burner.The perfume never ceased pouring out of the burner. Even when there was a gust of wind, the perfume would always float in Kai Yang\u2019s direction.He also discovered that if he stayed in the same spot and didn\u2019t move, then the perfume didn\u2019t have any effect.After another half an hour or so, Kai Yang felt that most of his strength had recovered. Staggering he stood up, once again he began to take steps forward.Since he had already been burned once, Kai Yang advanced slowly and cautiously monitored his body for the effects of the incense burner.As soon as he put one foot down, Kai Yang discovered that his strength gushed out of him like a broken dam. His physical strength disappeared, and with it so did his mental energy; with no sign or reason.As he took another step, what little strength he had remaining disappeared, causing him to nearly fall down.Clenching his jaw tightly, Kai Yang\u2019s stubborn attitude emerged again. Putting his life on the line, he advanced forward.This time, he managed to take four steps. And although he was mentally unwilling to give up, his body could no longer take it. His strength wasn\u2019t too bad.The warm feeling once again poured out from within him, but it was not strong enough so he fainted again.After repeating this process numerous times, all of his assumptions were confirmed.Although the perfume that came from the incense burner caused people to become more worn out, it didn\u2019t leave any negative side effects. While the golden skeleton on the other hand needed his will to fight, in order to be used. The stronger he felt about not yielding, the stronger the warmth it gave was and the more his body benefited.This type of training method was truly monstrous so much so that it was unthinkable. Putting it simply, you were risking your life to increase your strength. If you were a little bit careless, then there would be drastic consequences. Luckily Kai Yang\u2019s self-preservation sense was quite high. Everytime he broke through his limits, he would concede and rest before continuing. So after repeating the cycle many times, the results he reaped were bountiful.A person\u2019s potential, was truly unlimited. But in order to become stronger, you must do things step by step.After an entire day of training, his improvement was very clear. He could already walk a full ten steps, a large improvement from his first attempt of just three.But Kai Yang was still unsatisfied; even under the effects of the perfume, he was still only walking. Until the day he practised with his fists, this could not be considered training.Quickly, Kai Yang found another disastrous problem.This type of training used his herbs up far too quickly!The Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass could only be burned for about an hour. After an hour, he must once again put in more herbs for the incense burner to continue to produce the perfume.Using his hand to calculate the herb consumption, Kai Yang\u2019s face immediately became ugly.There were twelve hours in a day, he trained for about seven to eight hours a day. So that meant that he needed at least fourteen of these herbs, in order to practise under the effects of the incense burner for the a whole day. With his current store, he would use up all his Dead Jedi Tree Grass in two days, while also using about fifty percent of his stockpile of Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower.What would he do after he used up all his current herb stock? He only had thirty eight contribution points. How many days would that last him?Originally he had thought he was quite rich, but reality struck him hard and showed him how poor he really was.That night, he carried his worries to bed, his head full of contribution points and herbs. Even in his dreams, he dreamt of mining large amounts of Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and Dead Jedi Tree Grass.That night, Kai Yang didn\u2019t sleep very well at all.That night, Su Mu didn\u2019t sleep very well either.Thinking about how, overbearingly he had brought people over to cause trouble for Kai Yang, but had instead lost against him. This made Su Mu toss and turn restlessly in his bed. If it wasn\u2019t for Kai Yang, then he would be happily engaged with Boss He\u2019s daughter. If it wasn\u2019t for Kai Yang, then he wouldn\u2019t be here with a stomach full of resentment.As he recalled the He family\u2019s daughter\u2019s vivid appearance, Su Mu\u2019s heart fell into depression. In the future, he will no longer have the face to go and interact with her. As the saying went: \u2018You would rather destroy ten temples, than destroy one marriage.\u2019 Kai Yang, you dared to destroy a happy couple, you are too daring.As another saying went: \u2018For a nobleman to take revenge, ten years is not long at all.\u2019 An insignificant person however, can go for revenge all day long.Su Mu would definitely be classified as the latter, for after a few more days, he could once again challenge Kai Yang. But how could Su Mu wait until then? Su Mu wanted to go to Kai Yang immediately and beat him to a bloody pulp. Only then would it sate his inner hatred and resentment.Tossing and turning, he couldn\u2019t fall asleep such was his fury, so Su Mu got up. Not only did he get up in the middle of the night, he also made his underlings wake up too.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27 \u2013 Exchanging some pointers will not make you pregnantPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNot long after, a group of sleepy eyed Sky Tower disciples had gathered.\u201cYoung master Su, is there anything you need?\u201d Someone asked while rubbing their eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much, it\u2019s only about the affair this morning.\u201d Su Mu tried his hardest to calm down his heart: \u201cThe reason why I have gathered you all here is because I want you to help me come up with some ideas that will help me get revenge and pacify my hatred.\u201dSomeone said: \u201cYoung Master Su, why don\u2019t you just wait four days. In four days, you can go challenge Kai Yang, and you will definitely be able to beat him to pieces.\u201dAnnoyed, Su Mu replied: \u201cIf I really wanted to wait until then, then why did I call you all over?\u201dThe sleepy people who had been gathered, were suddenly startled into standing up. Evidently, they weren\u2019t very awake, so nobody had paid attention to Su Mu\u2019s words and only yawned widely. When he saw their reactions, Su Mu became vexed. Slapping the table he shouted: \u201cAll of you, help me think of some good ideas. If you guys can\u2019t help me think of some good ideas, none of you can think about going back to sleep!\u201dThis startled everyone, and they realised that Su Mu was actually angry. His slap and loud voice had caused them to fully regain consciousness and they hurriedly put their minds to use, thinking up some good strategies.Not long after a disciple named Li Yun Tian eyes widened from formulating a good plan. Opening his mouth, he told Su Mu: \u201cYoung Master, we could do this\u2026\u2026\u201dAs he said this, he crept closer to give a detailed explanation of his plan. How could they, how could they, how could they, able to, able to, able to.Su Mu\u2019s heart burst with joy, he hit Li Yun Tian\u2019s back in excitement while saying: \u201cNot bad. Not Bad. This is a good plan, so I will leave it to you to complete the task!\u201d\u201cLeave it to me young master Su!\u201d Li Yun Tian was also smiling widely.\u201cYou can all go back to sleep.\u201d Su Mu waved his hands as he said this and everybody relaxed themselves before promptly leaving to go back to their beds.Looking out at the pitch black darkness outside his room, Su Mu laughed evilly. \u201cKai Yang, Brother Kai, let us wait and see at dawn!\u201dFinally, with his heart content, Su Mu fell asleep.The next day, Kai Yang woke up to practise the tempered body record before going out to do some sweeping.Yesterday, when he used the incense burner to help practise, although he was constantly on the brink of death; so much so that even now his whole body ached; the results were really evident. This was most obvious when he was practising the tempered body fist, because he felt that the pressure he felt was slightly smaller. He had also understood that the pressure given from the incense burner was similar to the pressure he felt when practising the tempered body record. As long as he adapted to one type of pressure, he would naturally be able to adapt to another type.This incense burner was a good thing! His spirits high, Kai Yang wanted to quickly finish his work and go back to train.Just as Kai Yang was halfway through his sweeping, someone had suddenly blocked his path. Looking up, he thought that person looked vaguely familiar. When he was thinking this, that person opened their mouth and laughed loudly.(ED: It\u2019s here guys, Ning makes her reappearance. Prepare yourselves for more risque leg action, three quarter length pants incoming. Just kidding.)Last night Li Yun Tian had suggested a plan to Su Mu. Though he had everything planned, he didn\u2019t dare be careless, for he knew it would not be easy. He must not let the opposite party become suspicious and must first trick him; to make him exchange some moves with him.Yesterday when he had accompanied Su Mu to challenge Kai Yang, he had hidden himself at the rear of the crowd. He also didn\u2019t say much, so Kai Yang shouldn\u2019t be able to recognise him, making things much easier.Since earlier he had been waiting for Kai Yang to come past this area during his daily sweep. His waiting had finally paid off, Kai Yang had come here to sweep. Putting on a big and friendly smile :D, and a innocent and harmless demeanor, Li Yun Tian walked over.His current expression should be friendly enough! Li Yun Tian told himself to boost his confidence.\u201cDoes this fellow disciple have any problems?\u201d However Kai Yang was not courteous, since any disciple here currently should be his junior. It was early into the entry period, so their levels shouldn\u2019t be that high, so many would claim to be fellow disciples.\u201cAre you not senior disciple Kai Yang?\u201d Li Yun Tian asked as if he knew the answer already.Kai Yang nodded his head: \u201cYes.\u201dBreathing in deeply, Li Yun Tian said: \u201cSo it really is you! Senior Kai, I have been looking forward to meeting with you. Now that I have met you today, I can see you really live up to expectations!\u201d(TL: Arse-kisser)These words had made even Li Yun Tian himself want to vomit, but he must maintain the facade and act like his words were sincere.\u201cThis is serious, this is serious.\u201d Kai Yang\u2019s name was already loudly proclaimed by this junior.Li Yun Tian put up quite a performance. Taking Kai Yang\u2019s hand, he said admiringly: \u201cSenior Kai, I heard you had taught Zhou Hu a harsh lesson yesterday. You really a person with a big heart.\u201d\u201cWhat, you have enmity with him?\u201d asked Kai Yang while sizing him up.Li Yun Tian\u2019s face turned cold: \u201cYes I do. That person is like a beast, despicable; he even humiliated me once.\u201d\u201cBut you didn\u2019t go get revenge.\u201d Kai Yang noted.\u201cI even dream about getting revenge, but\u2026\u2026\u201d Sighing loudly he replied: \u201cSenior Kai, I\u2019m afraid you also know this, Zhou Hu has somebody supporting him. I wouldn\u2019t pay attention to an insignificant person like Zhou Hu, but the person behind is someone I can\u2019t easily provoke. \u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Kai Yang nodded his head, after all, Su Mu had some powerful people backing him. So an ordinary disciple obviously wouldn\u2019t dare provoke him.\u201cThat\u2019s why yesterday, when senior Kai gave Zhou Hu a lesson, you helped this junior get his revenge.\u201d Li Yun Tian said gratefully, tears flowing down his face.Laughing, Kai Yang replied: \u201cWe were only exchanging some pointers, it wasn\u2019t anything.\u201dLi Yun Tian pressed ahead: \u201cSenior Kai, since you were able to win against Zhou Hu, your strength shouldn\u2019t be that weak.\u201dWaving his hand Kai Yang replied: \u201cIt\u2019s not much, it isn\u2019t something so amazing.\u201dLi Yun Tian was sneering inside, you finally said something true. If you didn\u2019t plan something yesterday, then how could Zhou Hu possibly lose to you? But he didn\u2019t dare reveal his true thoughts, in case Kai Yang became suspicious. That would be disastrous for his plan.\u201cSenior you are too modest. Come, come, come, normally I, Li Yun Tian don\u2019t have the opportunity to exchange pointers with anybody. Senior Kai, you have done so much for me and since we happened to meet up today we must not miss this chance. Please spar with me.\u201d After going around in circles, Li Yun Tian finally found an opportunity to ask the question that was the true reason he had talked to Kai Yang.Forcing a smile, Kai Yang asked: \u201cYou want to compare notes with me?\u201dLi Yun Tian nodded his head enthusiastically: \u201cOf course. I hope senior will not be stingy, and allow this junior to see how senior defeated Zhou Hu. And to help me also.\u201dThis reason was really a bit hard to believe, shaking his head Kai Yang rejected the request: \u201cForget it. You don\u2019t usually fight others anyway.\u201dLi Yun Tian anxiously pressured him: \u201cThat won\u2019t do, senior you will agree even if you don\u2019t want to.\u201dLaughing, Kai Yang looked at him and laughed coldly.Li Yun Tian\u2019s heart jumped out. He was a bit impatient just then and was too rushed and forceful with his words, he immediately started laughing too: \u201cJunior is really too weak. So if senior were to give some pointers, it would be very helpful.\u201d\u201cNo can do.\u201d Kai Yang refused.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThere is no reason to\u2026..\u201dSeeing that Kai Yang was intentionally moving away from him now, Li Yun Tian called out: \u201cExchanging some notes, naturally we could help other greatly. Isn\u2019t that reason enough? If we exchanged pointers, it will benefit both of us.\u201d\u201cYou can put it like that, but\u2026..no. No, no.\u201d Repeatedly Kai Yang waved his hand.\u201cDon\u2019t be like that senior, exchanging some pointers will not make you pregnant.\u201d Li Yun Tian\u2019s face was full of anxiety, he didn\u2019t even dare reveal his true intentions. Heart thumping, he quickly thought up an idea: \u201cCould it be that senior is afraid that he will lose and his contribution points will be deducted, am I right?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 \u2013 Too pettyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 28 \u2013 Too pettyFacing Li Yun Tian\u2019s inquiry, Kai Yang had no response.Thinking that he had guessed correctly, Li Yun TIan smiled widely: \u201cDon\u2019t worry senior. Our strengths should be about the same, so it\u2019s not certain as to who will and who will lose. And if by chance, this junior wins and senior loses, then your losses will be covered by me.\u201d\u201cAre you serious?\u201d enquired Kai Yang, this was a rather unexpected.\u201cA nobleman\u2019s word is his bond!\u201d Li Yun Tian bellowed loudly.Originally he thought that he had successfully tricked Kai Yang, and had assumed his battle stance. He knew that Su Mu was hidden somewhere in the surrounding area, so if he was able to teach Kai Yang a good lesson, then he would be able to greatly increase his face.But Kai Yang just wrinkled his brows, nearly causing Li Yun Tian to stamp foot and curse his mother. This senior, is too ** annoying and like a bitch. How could Zhou Hu lose to this type of person?\u201cSenior, do you have any other questions?\u201d Li Yun Tian was on the verge of exploding in frustration.\u201cOh, although I would like to trade notes with you, regrettably I am unable to as I was already challenged by someone yesterday. If you really wanted to exchange pointers, then you must wait a few more days.\u201dBull! Li Yun Tian almost couldn\u2019t breathe, hastily he said: \u201cSenior, you can challenge me since I haven\u2019t been challenged these past few days. Don\u2019t all Sky Tower disciples have the chance to challenge someone every few days?\u201d\u201cIt was like this!\u201d Just realising this now, Kai Yang laughed out loud: \u201cJunior brother, these past few years, it has always been me who was challenged thus I had completely forgotten this rule.\u201dSlowly breathing out, Li Yun Tian really wanted to spit out all the rage and anger inside of him. After a while he inquired: \u201cSenior, now can we compare some notes?\u201dKai Yang still had another question: \u201cJunior, if I really lost, would you really pay me contribution points?\u201d\u201cI will! I will definitely pay you and not only that, I will pay you ten times the amount!\u201d He said, grinding his teeth together.Shaking his head, Kai Yang replied: \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. Unless you first pay me the contribution points I won\u2019t believe you.\u201d\u201cHow can I give them to you?\u201d Li Yun Tian replied gloomily, for contribution points were recorded down by a third party in an account book. It wasn\u2019t something you could just carry around to give to others. How was he, a senior, so narrow minded. Did he believe that he wouldn\u2019t stick to his word?\u201cI do have an alternative.\u201d Smiling cryptically at Li Yun Tian, Kai Yang beckoned him closer and whispered into his ear.Li Yun Tian\u2019s face changed into several shades of different colours and he couldn\u2019t help but admit that this Kai Yang\u2019s mind was really shrewd. He could actually think of this type of solution.\u201cJunior, if you feel that this is impossible then it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not because this senior cannot trust you, it\u2019s just\u2026\u2026\u201d Playing hard to get, Kai Yang hesitated to voice his next words.LI Yun Tian didn\u2019t know what he wanted, but in order for his own plan to succeed he must give in. So he asked: \u201cIt won\u2019t hurt, so senior please wait. Wait until I have retrieved the item. My speed is very fast.\u201dAs he was saying this, he was already speeding away.Looking at his receding back, Kai Yang sighed out in pity; to think there were still people in this world that were willing to offer themselves up to get beaten. With his request refused, he then went to retrieve something, he was really strange. Thankfully it temporarily achieved his needs. It was just that this method could only be used once, next time he would no longer be able to use it.After thinking for a while, Kai Yang mentally bashed himself. When he remembered the junior\u2019s desperateness, no matter what he requested he would have agreed.Su Mu, along with a bunch of other people were hidden too far from Kai Yang. Originally when he saw that Li Yun Tian and Kai Yang had started to talk, his heart was jumping circles. Just as he was settling down to enjoy a good show, Li Yun Tian hastily ran away, causing Su Mu to be confused.Yesterday when they were discussing the plan, this wasn\u2019t included! What was this Li Yun Tian up to?His heart full of doubt, Su Mu immediately ordered someone to intercept Li Yun Tian and inquire about the situation.After fifteen minutes, that person had returned and whispered to him: \u201cYoung master Su, Li Yun Tian said that Kai Yang is narrowed minded and had told him to first go to the Contribution Hall to retrieve some herbs to compensate him. Only then would he agree to compare notes.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you a bit too petty?\u201d Su Mu said flabbergastedly: \u201cKai Yang is only a trial disciple, so if he lost, he would only lose one contribution point. So, why would he need to compensate him ten herbs?\u201dThat person answer: \u201cLi Yun Tian caused this, he said that he would compensate him ten times the amount, so\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cEh, no wonder.\u201d Su Mu\u2019s face became slightly ugly, \u201cBut forget about it. As long as that Kai Yang can receive this lesson, ten herbs aren\u2019t that much.\u201dTen herbs cost about ten contribution points. Such a small amount of points weren\u2019t put into the eyes of Su Mu.Since everyone now knew the entire situation, they could only patiently await the battle.Half an hour passed and Kai Yang was nearly finished with his sweeping. Shortly thereafter, Kai Yang saw a red and tired face, it was Li Yun Tian running closer. Li Yun Tian didn\u2019t blame the fact that the distance of the Contribution was too large, but rather that Treasurer Meng who was still still asleep for causing him to take so long. After a long time of shouting and banging on the door, had he woken up.Since old man Meng was disturbed from his sweet dream, his temper was short. Without even allowing old man Meng the time to teach him a lesson, Li Yun Tian quickly purchased ten ordinary grade lower level herbs. This cost him about twenty contribution points.The anger Li Yun Tian held! He was determined to earn the interest back from Kai Yang\u2019s body.Returning, he saw that Kai Yang hadn't left. He stood there, with his broom in his hand waiting for him.Three steps, two steps, as Li Yun Tian gasped for breath, he rushed over to Kai Yang. Taking out the herbs, he breathlessly said: \u201cHere, check it senior.\u201d\u201cHehe, no need.\u201d Acting as if he was very big hearted, Kai Yang took the herbs without counting and placed them, along with his broom onto the ground.\u201cSenior, now can we compare notes?\u201d Li Yun Tian asked.\u201cWe can, we can. Actually, junior didn\u2019t have to go to such lengths. IF you had asked, this senior would have readily agreed.\u201d Kai Yang smiled cheerfully.Li Yun Tian was nearly angered to the point of meeting buddha, two buddhas in heaven, three in nirvana and four living together. It was you who wanted the herbs, it was you who didn\u2019t trust me, and it was you who made me travel such a distance. Could it be that this whole journey was unnecessary?But he will forget about it he decided, and chose to take some deep breaths to calm down his mind. For today, once this battle started, he would thoroughly teach Kai Yang a good lesson.\u201cJunior, shall we start?\u201d Kai Yang queried Li Yun Tian\u2019s opinion.\u201cOkay.\u201d His spirited roused, Li Yun Tian replied and cupped his hands. \u201cPlease give me some teachings senior!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t dare, don\u2019t dare!\u201d Kai Yang humbly smiled.Neither dared or wanted to reveal their current cultivation levels. Li Yun Tian was afraid that it would scare Kai Yang away, while Kai Yang wanted to keep it a secret. With each thinking of their own reasons in their respective minds, the battle started.Seeing Zhou Hu\u2019s mistake yesterday and his heart full of hatred, how could Li Yu Tian possibly be merciful? He thought as he prepared to use thunder to knock down this senior.With the lightning fast exchanges, the air around became charged with tension. Dodging each other\u2019s attacks, Kai Yang and Li Yun Tian had already exchanged fists. Since Li Yun Tian\u2019s heart was full of hatred, his fists didn\u2019t contain any real power. But within his flurry of fists, each was faster than the last and more profound.Kai Yang didn\u2019t panic but remained calm. The practise that he had been doing these past few days started to show their results. With only the Sky Tower\u2019s basic skills and the kicks, he fought.After a few exchanges, Li Yun Tian became fearful. His opponent exuded a vigourous energy, which left him unstable and pushed him back a few steps. Not only that, each punch that he threw out made him feel like he hit a boulder and left his whole hand numb.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 \u2013 A big lossPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 29 \u2013 A big lossAfter suffering a loss, Li Yun Tian didn\u2019t dare to be carelessly anymore. Intensely looking at Kai Yang, he flitted about before executing a couple of swift punches towards Kai Yang.That\u2019s for being narrow-minded, that\u2019s for making me run to the Contribution Hall so early in the morning, he grumbled inside while attacking. \u2018Peng, peng\u2019 resounded every time Li Yun Tian struck out. Nearby, Su Mu was stunned as each fist landed on Kai Yang, while Li Yun Tian felt pain with each fist.Both people were tempered body cultivators, but since their levels weren\u2019t very high, the amount of blows they exchanged were small. Furthermore, Kai Yang wanted to tests out his body's condition, so he allowed Li Yun Tian to land his attacks on his body.Within the time it took to make some tea, Kai Yang came to understand his current body condition; it was stronger, far stronger than a few days ago. With his goal achieved, Kai Yang no longer wanted to be subjected to his junior\u2019s nagging.Just as victory was at hand for Li Yun Tian, something changed. The Senior Kai, who could only retreat and defend a few moment ago, face lit up in excitement. It was like when an evil spirit met a naked young lady. This sudden change in attitude caused Li Yun Tian to feel uneasy.more closely, he noticed that Kai Yang\u2019s excitement was different to what he had previously thought. It was a colder and bloodthirsty type of excitement.With a bad feeling in his stomach, Li Yun Tian retreated, but one step from Kai Yang blocked his path, he was like a towering mountain.Jumping up, Li Yun Tian wanted to escape from Kai Yang\u2019s pursuit. Raising his leg, Kai Yang swept it towards Li Yun Tian\u2019s waist.A miserable cry leaked out of his mouth, while he flew a couple of feet. Without pausing, Kai Yang ruthlessly stepped down, stomped on him and a rain of fists followed.A bloodcurdling scream echoed.This round of \u2018note comparing\u2019 ended up with Li Yun Tian losing, begging for mercy.When Li Yun Tian was sent flying earlier, he still had the intention to continue. But under the merciless barrage of Kai Yang\u2019s punches, his injuries quickly increased.After a while, Li Yun Tian could no longer endure it. Afterwards he noticed Kai Yang and his own reactions were completely different.The more he hit Kai Yang , the more excited Kai Yang became. When he hit him, the more painful and sorrowful it became for Li Yun Tian.Why would there be anyone who would be happy to get beaten? The more red, blood and flesh that Kai Yang saw, the happier he looked. It made him look slightly mad.Li Yun Tian thought this person was mad. Yet after the end of the battle, Kai Yang returned to normal, back to his kind and amiable self. In fact, he even helped to pull him back up and smiled saying that he allowed him to win. Then he picked up his broom and left.When he was in battle compared to when he was not in battle, he was two completely different people!His body was sore all over, how could he not sustain some injuries from Kai Yang\u2019s multiple fists.This time, it really was a case of trying to steal the chicken but losing the rice to lure it, Li Yun Tian thought in tears.He had already constantly refused to compare notes with Li Yun Tian, yet he had been adamant. He even spent twenty contribution points in exchange for ten herbs to secure the exchange. And the result\u2026\u2026.he had lost. Not only were the herbs taken away from him, he will also be deducted contribution points.This time, it really was a big loss! Was this not offending because of something petty? Li Yun Tian felt endless regret.Su Mu and the others, watching from not too far away were also shocked stupid. When they saw Li Yun Tian and Kai Yang start, they were sorely tempted to jump out and started cheering; for he had finally succeed in getting Kai Yang to exchange pointers. Soon, Kai Yang was going to be beaten black and blue.Su Mu even had it all planned out. When Kai Yang was beaten, he would go over and give a few extra words of ridicule. That way, he will be able to release some of his heart\u2019s anger. But contrary to what they expected, when the battle started, Kai Yang had fought Li Yun Tian to a stand still.For a while Su Mu thought the things that he saw were a little blurry. Suspiciously, he leaned over and asked: \u201cWhat stage is Li Yun Tian again?\u201d\u201cTempered body seventh stage and has already started to cultivate train his own vitality. It\u2019s just that the time he has trained it is too little, so it cannot be used well yet.\u201d\u201cAnd Kai Yang?\u201d Su Mu asked again.\u201cI think he is about the tempered body fourth stage?\u201d His voice a bit uncertain.Everyone was overwhelmed with shock, for despite a difference of three stages, he had managed to fight evenly with Li Yun Tian and that was too monstrous. No wonder yesterday Zhou Hu was defeated with only three moves. Even with such a large difference, Kai Yang had won. So even if Zhou Hu had used all his strength, he wouldn\u2019t win.But, how could that person, of all these speculations, be that powerful? If he really possessed this type of strength, why would he lose all his previous battles? Kai Yang had been a trial disciple for three years already, and year after he was admitted, he was constantly challenged. Every time, until yesterday, he hadn\u2019t won a single one of his battles in these past two years.The greatest shock that Su Mu and co. were to experience had yet to come. They had thought that Kai Yang being able to endure even one of Li Yun Tian\u2019s strikes was nothing short of a miracle; there was no possible way for him to win. Yet, when Kai Yang really defeated Li Yun Tian, everybody was like a crow and peacock, making no sound. They couldn\u2019t believe their own eyes.A tempered body fourth stage practitioner beat a tempered body seventh stage practitioner. In the couple of hundred years of Sky Tower\u2019s history, this type of situation had never happened before. Could it be that even a stinky salty fish will have a chance to turn over?As he was standing there in a trance, Su Mu felt someone tap his shoulder gently. Turning around, he was greeted by Kai Yang smiling at him while carrying his broom. His face full of affection he said: \u201cJunior Su, if there will be another good opportunity like this, please remember to notify me as well.\u201d\u201cYou already knew?\u201d The corners of Su Mu\u2019s mouth twitched.Gently, Kai Yang chuckled: \u201cYesterday, although junior Li was hidden within the crowd, he was with you. The only good point of this senior is his memory.\u201d\u201cHow sly!\u201d Su Mu hated him so much that he gnashed his teeth together vigorously. Only now, did he realise everybody had been thoroughly tricked by Kai Yang.\u201cWe\u2019re both in the same boat.\u201d He laughed: \u201cOh right, I can still challenge someone tomorrow. Aren\u2019t we all allowed to request anyone for a battle once everyday? Enjoy your day everybody and I will come find you tomorrow.\u201dEveryone\u2019s face immediately became ice cold. Witnessing Kai Yang\u2019s current actions, hadn\u2019t he experienced the sweetness from this little action? Then when they looked at Li Yun Tian and thought how their own strengths were about the same level as Li Yun Tian, a shiver ran down their spines. Frightened they said: \u201cYoung master Su, what should we do now?\u201dSu Mu was also at his wits end. After all, duels were a long time tradition of Sky Tower. Which disciple hasn\u2019t been challenged before? Although he had someone backing him, he still didn\u2019t dare to recklessly break the Main Gate rules.\u201cRelax, he probably said it to scare you. If he really came to challenge you, I will make sure that he won\u2019t be able to walk.\u201dHearing Su Mu say this, everyone felt more secure and relaxed.Kai Yang had thought of this on the spot. All Sky Tower disciples had the opportunity to issue a challenge each day and since he had never used this privilege before, he naturally had forgotten about it. With today\u2019s reminder from Li Yun Tian, he had remembered it.One battle a day, however defeating an ordinary disciple could only earn him two contribution points, but mosquito meat is still meat. After accumulating them for a month, it would not be a small amount.Besides, on the road of martial cultivation, you cannot close yourself off completely from the outside world. Battling these fellow disciples and exchanging some pointers, will not do any harm and it doesn\u2019t take very long. Just treat it like a relaxation activity, you can even earn some contribution points while you relax. What harm is there?Though, the harvest from today\u2019s challenge was quite a good one. Not only did he earn two contribution points, he also gained ten strands of much needed Dead Jedi Tree Grass. This was such a profitable day.If there was someone to give him ten herbs everyday, how good would that be! Kai Yang daydreamed a bit.Returning to his wooden hut, Kai Yang immediately took out the incense burner and lit it. Breathing in the perfume, he started his arduous training.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 \u2013 The salty fish turns overPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 30 \u2013 The salty fish turns overThe next day, a whole group of disciples were gathered to practise. They talked and laughed together, although the work was very tiring, it was done in a festive manner. Suddenly, someone called out in a certain direction: \u201cYoung\u2026\u2026young master Su\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Su Mu asked dubiously.\u201cHe really came.\u201d\u201cWho came?\u201d Somewhat impatiently, Su Mu gazed over the in the direction the person was pointing towards. There he saw Kai Yang holding his broom and grinning while walking towards them.Everybody\u2019s faces fell.\u201cGood morning my fellow brother and sister disciples. You are all such diligent people, practising so early in the morning.\u201d Kai Yang greeted everyone, while purposely looking over at Zhou Hu and Li Yun Tian, who both backed away, their faces red. When they thought about the power of Kai Yang\u2019s fists, their skin crawled.\u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d Su Mu was a bit worried. Although he already knew Kai Yang\u2019s motive, he still asked. After all, he had opened his mouth and assured everyone yesterday that he would deal with Kai Yang.\u201cTo challenge.\u201d His smile incomparably wide, Kai Yang\u2019s gaze swept throughout the throng of people. Cordially he asked: \u201cWhich fellow disciples haven\u2019t been challenged in these past few days? Please allow this senior to test your might.\u201dThe Sky Tower\u2019s Main Gate rules state that you should not avoid challenges and not shy away from them! Disobey, and you will be expelled.With these rules in place, the people under Su Mu were deathly afraid of Kai Yang. For as long as the opponent issued a challenge, they would have to accept if they had not been challenged in these past five days. That would mean, even if they knew they would receive a beating, they could only brace themselves and accept.That day, Zhang San was the one who was challenged. Satisfied, Kai Yang walked away, while Su Mu damned him and hurled curses at his back.The next day, Kai Yang came again, that time it was Li Shi who got challenged. Walking away satisfied after winning once again, Su Mu threatened Kai Yang non-stop but it was to no avail.On the third day, Kai Yang had come yet again, it was Wang Wu who got unlucky and received a swollen face and bloody nose for his troubles. Once again, his heart satisfied, Kai Yang left, while Su Mu swore weakly.When Kai Yang had came the fourth time, Su Mu had also learned. Su Mu no longer threatened or cursed Kai Yang, for he knew they were no use because this Senior Kai was not afraid of his threats at all.Su Mu only fiercely glared at him, harbouring a bone and soul piercing hatred.Enduring this type of frustrating torment, the people under Su Mu had begun to quit.This was plain bullying by Kai Yang. For there were many ordinary disciples throughout Sky Tower, yet he purposely came to challenge the disciples under Su Mu. It was very clear that he was here for revenge. Not to mention, the amount of people within this group was not small; so he would always be able to find someone to challenge and obtain favourable results.Within these past few days, Kai Yang had caused quite a tempest. He was only a lowly trial disciple, yet he really was a salty fish that turned over and he managed to make everyone pay attention to him. Ever since he had defeated Zhou Hu, he had changed into someone that others weren\u2019t able to easily beat or manipulate. Everyday he would go and challenge disciples and each time he would win. Rumors even stated that Su Mu had gotten to the point that he no longer retaliated. What type of person was Su Mu ah, he was someone with powerful backing.Even someone like him couldn't do anything to Kai Yang, so what could ordinary disciples do? Subsequently, no disciples dared to go and challenge Kai Yang. Not one person was unaware that this person who had entered for three years and had been demoted to a trial disciple was not an easily provoked person.As this news travelled through the many disciples, many were guessing at his cultivation. Some guessed that he was at the tempered body fourth stage, some said tempered body fifth stage and some even guessed tempered body eighth stage. After all he did defeat the tempered body seventh stage practitioner Li Yun Tian.But no matter who, no one knew Kai Yang\u2019s true cultivation.Only Xia Ning Chang knew! These past few days, every time Kai Yang went to challenge someone, she was always there peeking. With her natural talent and cultivation, she could naturally see Kai Yang\u2019s true level.But since Xia Ning Chang could see his true cultivation, she feared him.This junior, when he had defeated Li Yun Tian, he was only at that tempered body fifth stage. And with the passing of a mere four days, he had risen to the tempered body sixth stage.How did he cultivate? Even if it was her, armed with her special physique, when she was cultivating in the tempered body stage, she had used no small amount of medicinal pellets, yet she wasn\u2019t as fast as him.In a state of confusion, Xia Ning Chang had sneakily stalked Kai Yang to investigate how he cultivated. Though, no matter where she looked, or went, she couldn\u2019t unravel the mystery or find anything unusual. He only punched a few fists, kicked his feet and made himself all weary and sweaty.Xia Ning Chang couldn\u2019t understand how the basic techniques of Sky Tower could make him so powerful. They weren\u2019t even profound techniques.At the end of her investigation spanning these past few days, Xia Ning Chang was left clueless. Although she had a feeling that Kai Yang still had hidden secrets, she was not bold enough to continue investigating. For a young girl to often peek at someone was not an honorable act, especially a youngster who was often half naked.Everytime Xia Ning Chang looked, she became beet red and ashamed endlessly. Everytime this person trained, he would take off his shirt, as if his bony ribs were something good to show off.\u201cHowever, he seemed to be more robust than before, with more muscles.\u201d Thinking back to the time she first saw his **, Xia Ning Chang unconsciously compared. When she finished comparing, her faced flushed red again.Meanwhile Kai Yang was oblivious to the fact that he had been watched these past days. Everyday he would sweep his assigned area and then go find Su Mu\u2019s group to challenge them. Afterwards, he would return back home to start his training. This was repetitive and tedious work, but also very fulfilling.The incense burner\u2019s impact was exceptionally large, and matched with the daily tempered body record training, it had allowed him to break through to the tempered body sixth stage yesterday. This made the atmospheric energy within his body further solidify and stabilize.With another step, with just another step he would step into the tempered body seventh stage. Once he reached this stage, he would be able to produce his own vitality; even though the amount he would be able to produce wasn\u2019t that much, it was still vitality. Also as long as he could produce his own vitality, he could then start to cultivate martial skills. At that time, his attacks would not longer be restricted to the leg whip and the shaolin fists.The tempered body seventh to ninth stages were the stage in which one's\u2019 vitality developed, and also when the vitality travelled through a practitioner\u2019s meridians and allowed them to reach the mastery stage. Only in this stage when one\u2019s vitality was being born could this be achieved, you must then use it to break open the heaven and earth bridge so as to break away from the tempered body boundary to the next stage.It was like playing with your own life, this training of Kai Yang's, each and everyday Kai Yang could feel his growth; it was an extremely vivid feeling. Today, Kai Yang was finally able to practise his fists while under the influence the incense perfume, but the duration he was able to endure wasn\u2019t very long. When he practised the tempered body piece in the mornings, it had become easier, and was improving everyday.If these conditions were maintained, Kai Yang was confident that he could truly mature and become stronger.But Kai Yang was in an embarrassing situation, his Dead Jedi Tree Grass stock had run out and his Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower, although sparingly used, was almost finished as well.These past few days, Kai Yang had used the herbs sparingly, but he still ran out. As he used them, they had inevitably run out.With no alternative, Kai Yang could only go to the Contribution Hall and use up all his remaining contribution points to purchase these herbs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 \u2013 Tonight, raid Kai Yang during the nightPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 31 \u2013 Tonight, raid Kai Yang during the nightSponsored by \u2013 Pang V.This time, out of the goodness in his heart, Treasurer Meng gave Kai Yang a few extra clippings of the herbs, but he still refused to let go of the matters pertaining to his cultivation. He constantly asked how Kai Yang manage to improve his strength so quickly.It looked like the news of Kai Yang beating Su Mu\u2019s underlings had even reached Treasurer Meng\u2019s ears.Towards Treasurer Meng, Kai Yang still had a reasonably good impression. Although the old man was a bit crazy and thick skinned, he was very likable when measured by Kai Yang\u2019s standards.This situation wasn\u2019t easily explained, so Kai Yang could only say that when he was in Black Wind Mountains, he ate a special fruit which allowed him to gain enlightenment on how to cultivate.After contemplating for a while, Treasurer Meng thought back to the time period when Kai Yang entered the mountains and his current behaviour. This explanation was the most reasonable and believable explanation, so Treasurer had no choice but to accept it.Exiting the Contribution Hall, Kai Yang was deeply worried.All of his contribution points had been used to purchase these herbs and by his estimation, they would only last him three to four days. Afterwards, what would he use to get these herbs?Even though he was able to earn two contribution points from his daily challenges, these points could only be accessed on the eighth day of every month. With his calculations, he would need to wait twenty days. How could he possibly wait until then?Without being able to think of a solutions, Kai Yang became depressed and could only continue training.A few days passed by in a blur, and Kai Yang\u2019s tempered body sixth stage cultivation began to stabilize and he marched towards the seventh stage.In comparison to Kai Yang\u2019s good mood, Su Mu\u2019s followers felt like they were thrown into a flaming abyss. These past few days, Kai Yang would come to find them and cause trouble, causing them to feel vexed beyond compare. They couldn\u2019t contend against him in strength and couldn\u2019t hide from him, it was stifling beyond compare.While Su Mu personally held some confidence at his chance of victory should he fight Kai Yang, unfortunately for the others the gap between them and Kai Yang was too large. They couldn\u2019t challenge him \u2014 Su Mu still thought that Kai Yang was at the tempered body fourth or fifth stage.Su Mu knew that this could continue no longer, if it continued any longer, then all his underlings would leave.Thinking for awhile, Su Mu prepared to do something heartless and called all the Sky Tower disciples who had been beaten by Kai Yang, frowning he said: \u201cTonight, raid Kai Yang\u2019s hut during the night, wipe away all shame you have suffered!\u201dSince they couldn\u2019t win by following the rules, they won\u2019t follow them at all!Everyone jumped up, startled: \u201cA raid?\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Su Mu nodded his head.\u201cThis isn\u2019t good.\u201d Li Yun Tian was hesitant: \u201cAlthough that guy Kai Yang is a bit dishonest, he at least openly challenged and defeated us all. If the news of us mounting a sneak attack got out, we would be unable to escape punishment.\u201dLi Yun Tian\u2019s statements got the agreement of all the people present.Su Mu indignantly replied: \u201cBut he is too much! He has completely disregarded us fellow disciples and comes everyday. If we don\u2019t give him a proper lesson, who knows how long this ferocious act will continue. Regardless, tonight I will definitely go cause some trouble for him. All those willing to do so, follow me, as for those who are unwilling I won\u2019t force you. If anything were to happen, I swear that I, Su Mu will bear all consequences and won\u2019t involve you.\u201dSu Mu\u2019s words were sincere, and even if they still felt that it wasn\u2019t honorable, they couldn\u2019t refute his position. After all, Su Mu had promised to carry all the consequences on his shoulders, showing the utmost benevolence.Thinking for a bit, Li Yun Tian spoke: \u201cThis is also good. If this succeeds, then we will be able to teach that bastard that we aren\u2019t so easily provoked. Young master Su, this time, this disciple will put his life on the line and play with you!\u201d\u201cWe will also come.\u201d The remaining people chorused.Nodding and smiling, Su Mu cried: \u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dThat night, with everybody\u2019s spirit trembling in excitement they gathered in Su Mu\u2019s room waiting until sunset.\u201cIs everybody ready?\u201d Su Mu inquired.They nodded their heads.\u201cGood. This time we must make this moment unforgettable for that bastard!\u201d Su Mu shouted, while putting a black cloth over his face, leaving only a slim gap from which his evil gaze leaked out. Their emotions roused, the others followed suite.\u201cSet off!\u201d Calling for action, Su Mu issued the move out order.Ten or so shadows flashed out of his room, quickly merging into the night\u2019s darkness.During the night, Sky Tower had disciples posted about patrolling the premises. Unfortunately, Su Mu and his group were Sky Tower disciples too and were all too familiar with the patrol routes, allowing them to easily avoid these patrols.Otherwise, why would a family thief be hard to ward against. Su Mu\u2019s current actions were a model example of this saying.Shortly, Su Mu\u2019s group gathered in front of Kai Yang\u2019s small wooden hut. Standing about ten to twenty feet away, they suppressed the sounds of their breathing, their indignation flared at the memory of the injustice they had suffered.\u201cThere are no lights inside the hut, Kai Yang must be asleep already.\u201d Calming his heart, Su Mu turned his head to face Li Yun Tian at his side: \u201cKai Yang\u2019s strength isn\u2019t weak. So later you and I will hold him down, while everyone else beats him, remember to use all your strength.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Li Yun Tian nodded his head.\u201cAs long as it\u2019s not life threatening, you can hit however you want.\u201d Su Mu reminded, and they all promised.\u201cGo!\u201d Waving his hand, Su Mu shot towards the wooden hut. Ten shadows flickered against the night, rushing onwards. Those who cultivated, could run without making the slightest noise, they just needed to suppress the noise of their breathing to hide their presence. Their imaginations running wild, all their spirits rose as they thought about how Kai Yang would look injured and bloody.This past few days, they were tormented miserably by Kai Yang.Even though they were still around ten feet away, the cold gleam in Su Mu\u2019s eyes became more intense and his lips couldn\u2019t help but curve upwards.As the distance shrunk, the wooden hut\u2019s wooden door could be seen, in the blink of an eye Su Mu had already started to reach out to push open the door.Suddenly, a sweet fragrance entered his nose. Smelling this fragrance, Su Mu felt that this fragrance was very strange. It didn\u2019t smell very nice, nor did it smell very bad, it truly was a fragrance that he had never smelt before.Although he was a bit suspicious, Su Mu didn\u2019t give it any more thought and continued to charge forwards.Stepping forward, Su Mu\u2019s body became soft, he narrowly avoided falling. Breaking out in cold sweat, Su Mu recalled just moments ago it felt like all his strength had been sucked out from him. His brain buzzing he became mind became muddled, tiredly he steadied himself.Taking another step caused Su Mu to directly fall to the ground, nose first. Then two warm streams flowed down from his nose filling his mouth with the metallic taste of blood.\u201cPa, pa, pa\u2026\u2026..\u201d A series of sounds sounded out and converged towards the wooden hut originating from the Sky Tower disciples that had followed Su Mu. One by one, each of them, like Su Mu, fell to the ground. Each of them felt weak and powerless, all had bloody noses and battered looks. Their anguished wailing resounded out in the quiet night, making it all the more livelier.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Struggling greatly, Su Mu turned his head towards Li Yun Tian and asked.Li Yun Tian struggled to drag himself back upright, but he was powerless and could only lay on the ground gasping for breath. This expression was horrendously ugly, hesitatingly he said: \u201cYoung master Su, I\u2019m afraid that we have been poisoned.\u201d\u201cPoisoned?\u201d Su Mu turned pale in fright.\u201cIn addition, it\u2019s a very powerful poison\u2026..\u201d Trembling, Li Yun Tian reached out with his hand: \u201cYoung\u2026\u2026master Su, I\u2019m afraid that I can\u2019t hold on any longer. You\u2026..you must get revenge for me!\u201dAfter he finished passing on his last will and testament, Li Yun Tian\u2019s head fell and he ceased all movement.Overwhelmed by shock, Su Mu desperately and repeatedly called out his name. But no matter how many times he called out, he couldn\u2019t wake him. When he turned his head around again, he saw that of the brother disciples that he had brought with him, none had escaped. All without exception were laying still, making no sound.(TL: You would think that Kai Young would have sensed or at least heard all this noise by now. Wot?\u10da(\u0ca0_\u0ca0\u10da) ED: Honey badger don\u2019t give a f***.)An indescribable sense of panic and mourning filled his heart, unexpectedly, Su Mu\u2019s was able to calm his mind in this situation.This was the territory of Sky Tower, how could they be poisoned? And this poison\u2019s effect was this potent, not even three breaths had passed before their lives were taken, one by one.WOOAAHHH! This is fresh, first time MC\u2019s op training killed others. Looking forward to future story arcs now! Aren\u2019t you? ^Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why did they poison this hut, was it meant for them?Just as he was thinking about these matters in a confused state, his ears picked up a sudden and surprised voice. \u201cHuh?\u201dIt\u2019s Kai Yang\u2019s voice! Su Mu hated Kai Yang down to his bones, naturally he would be able recognise his voice.It\u2019s him. It turned out that it was Kai Yang who had poisoned them! Bastard! We had only intended to come and teach you a lesson, yet you were this murderous! Isn\u2019t this too cruel, isn\u2019t it?In his heart Su Mu cursed Kai Yang, however he had rapidly begun to lose consciousness.Fuck. Could it be that this master will die this muddle headed? This poor young master who was full of ambitions, and before these ambitions could be fulfilled, he will die an early death. The heaven\u2019s were jealous, the heaven\u2019s were jealous ah!Stepping lightly, Kai Yang walked over to the the group of fallen disciples. Crouching down, he took off their face masks, only to discover that they were all people he was familiar with.Thinking for a bit, Kai Yang realised what they had wanted to do. It was probably because he had tortured them too miserably these past few days, so they had come for revenge during the night.But they really had some bad luck.Playing with the incense burner in his hands, Kai Yang didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.This really was an accident, but they were really too unlucky. Usually he would have long since recalled the incense burner back into the black book, but today\u2019s training was too exhausting. So by accident, he had fallen asleep. And before the remainder of the herbs had been burned, Su Mu and his group had unfortunately come and ended up inhaling the incense.The incense that came from within the burner was very powerful, and when Kai Yang had first been subjected to the effects, he could only manage to take three steps before collapsing onto the ground. And this was with the golden skeleton within his body, so how could Su Mu\u2019s group hope to withstand it?They didn\u2019t have the support of the golden skeleton for recovery, so he estimated they would need to cultivate for a couple of days before they would regain their strength.Although, through his negligence, he must bear some responsibility for the current situation, it was also because of their arrogance. If the moment they had smelled the incense and stopped breathing, then they wouldn\u2019t be in this pitiful state.\u201cHey, why did you come?\u201d Sighing loudly, Kai Yang stored the incense burner back into the black book, while looking at the pile of bodies strewn about his floor awkwardly.Pondering for a moment, Kai Yang decided to drag all of them to a random area and leave them there.When he returned to his wooden hut, he went back to sleep.Because of that incident, Kai Yang became more vigilant. He must quickly breakthrough into the next tempered body stage. Currently he could only use the incense burner outside of the black book, but if he quickly broke through and neared the Kai Yuan stage, then it would no longer be so inconvenient to use. At that time, even if the incense burner was still inside the black book, he would be able to use it. The only requirement would be that he still had energy to channel into the black book.The next few days, Kai Yang trained bitterly, despite using the two herbs sparingly, they decreased steadily everyday.On the third morning, after he had completed his daily tempered body record training, he faced the east to breathe in the rich qi. While doing so the atmospheric energy in his meridians suddenly stirred and rose rapidly. It was like they were little insects scuttling about his meridians.His face straightening, Kai Yang quickly paused to check his body.The scuttering of his atmospheric energy also caused his muscles and blood to tingle, numbing his entire body. He didn\u2019t know how long this numbing feeling persisted for, but suddenly Kai Yang felt his body lighten, while his abdomen began to heat up. The mad scuttering of his atmospheric energy immediately dissipated.The warm feeling in his abdomen seemed to come to life, meanwhile Kai Yang was in ecstasy.Vitality! He had finally stepped up, he was at tempered body seventh stage now and had started to develop his vitality. Vitality was a clear sign of this.In your life, the first bit of vitality that you develop comes from within your dantian, but this vitality was very nominal amount. It was unable to support the usage of even one martial skill in a battle. This was because as soon as you used this strand of vitality, it would disappear. In order to regain it, you must expend a large amount of energy.But because of this little strand of vitality, a practitioner could now be able to start their cultivation of martial skills.The Sky Tower basic fists and kicks were not comparable to the might of a martial skill. A martial skill called upon one\u2019s vitality in order to be executed, and they were the foundation of strength for all martial practitioners.For a simple punch, the power that came from the tempered body seventh stage was far superior than the sixth stage. If the tempered body sixth stage punch could produce a power of 200 jin, then with the aid of vitality, the punch from the tempered body seventh could produce 500 jin or even 1000 jin of power.Of course, when you were in the tempered body stage, a practitioner wouldn\u2019t easily use martial skills because it wasn\u2019t easy to recover your vitality. Only when you reached the Kai Yuan Stage, could you freely use martial skills as you pleased in battles. When you reached that stage, vitality was quickly recovered.The main issue was how fast one could recover their vitality.So once you entered the tempered body seventh stage, a practitioner must use that small stand of vitality to create their foundations and slowly increase their vitality.A common method was to cultivate martial skills!Every martial skill required several strands, or even dozens of strands or even the strands from various meridians to execute. With different paths and orders, one can form many different martials skills.While you were cultivating martial skills to increase your vitality, you would open your body\u2019s zhou tian and naturally progress to the Kai Yuan stage. Every practitioner would do this.Kai Yang was no exception.Once he knew he had reached the tempered body seventh stage, Kai Yang immediately calmed his beating heart and rushed back into the wooden hut to call out the black book.He flipped directly to the fourth page and earnestly scanned the page.During these past days, as soon as he had broken through, he would try to unlock the fourth page. Unfortunately he had never succeeded. Kai Yang guessed that he needed the tempered body seventh stage to unlock it, as soon as he reached the tempered body seventh stage the fourth page began to morph.His guess was indeed correct!After floating around for a short while, the wisps of golden light covered the page. Separating from the page, these gold beams of light directly entered Kai Yang\u2019s mind.Within his mind, new information appeared suddenly, True Yang Tactics! This was the reward that the black book had bestowed upon Kai Yang for breaking through. Going over the information, his expression became distorted.This True Yang Tactics was slightly different from common martial skills. Normal martials skills had set paths of sequences, and although they could change, they were only superficial changes; they didn\u2019t change the base of the skill. They didn\u2019t stray from their base, if they did, then it would a completely different skill altogether.But this True Yang Tactics didn\u2019t. It didn\u2019t have set activation sequences and changed constantly. It could be described as arbitrary or you could say that it actually didn\u2019t have any singular form.This was the first difference.The cultivation method for the True Yang Tactics was also quite simple, but there were conditions to cultivate it.You must cultivate in an environment with plenty of yang energy to cultivate the True Yang Tactics.But through this secret method, once the cultivated yang vitality reached a certain point, it could be condendensed into a liquid form and stored within the dantian.This was something no martial skill or secret art could achieve. Because there will always be a moment when one\u2019s body would be filled. Once a martial practitioner was filled with vitality, there was no way to increase the amount, unless you broke your limit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 \u2013 Origin of YangPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 33 \u2013 Origin of YangNow Vitality \u2192 World QiBut the True Yang Tactics were different. When you cultivated your Yang World Qi to the limit, your World Qi would condense into a liquid form and merge with your dantian. This would cause your meridians to empty, thereby allowing you to continue to cultivate World Qi. In other words, if you practised this secret art, there would be no limit to the amount you could cultivate, however you needed Yang qi to be able to practise it without any limit.This was the second difference. With these differences and the origin of the True Yang Tactics, it clearly displayed how this skill was far from ordinary.When he started to cultivate his Yang qi, he would be able to use his liquified Yang qi to attack.Contemplating for a while, Kai Yang decided to cultivate the True Yang Tactics.Firstly, it was because he had no other alternatives and also had no more contribution points, as a result he was unable to obtain any martial skills from the Main Gate. Secondly, it was because he had great confidence in anything that came from the black book. The skills obtained from the Main Gate may not even be comparable to the True Yang Tactics.As for the training environment, it wasn\u2019t anything to be concerned about. The sun also had a Yang attribute, so as long as there was sunlight, he would be able to cultivate the True Yang Tactics. It was just that the efficiency would be quite low.Afterall, the sun had to shine over an enormous area of land and given it was providing this in the form of a equally large expanse of light. How much of this could a human possibly absorb?With his decision finalised, Kai Yang walked out of his hut and found a patch of sunlight. Sitting down, he closed his eyes, and imagined the path for the True Yang Tactics. Concentrating, he began to focus and control the thin strand of World Qi within in his dantian and direct it according to the path from the True Yang Tactics.For everything, the beginning was the most difficult part; this saying was not wrong at all. Kai Yang could connect himself to that thin strand of World Qi, but to take it and let it travel through his meridians was difficult beyond measure.Under the blazing sun, he trained for the entire day and only increased the thin strand of World Qi by a tiny bit and the travelling speed of his World Qi was as slow as a turtle. But in the end it was the first time he attempted it, so to have this result already caused Kai Yang to be very pleased.This was a cumulative type of training and was not something that could be completed overnight. But in regards to this, Kai Yang was in no way lacking of patience.After three days of hard work, Kai Yang finally managed to guide his World Qi from his dantian to his chest meridian. With a single thought, the small and considerably weak strand of World Qi surged up from within his chest and surged around his chestal acupoint.Following the black book, he knew he must first establish his Origin of Yang. This was the first step to cultivating the True Yang Tactics.This Origin of Yang had no other use apart from assisting him in sensing the Yang qi around him. All in all, Kai Yang\u2019s strength was far too low and he still had yet to form his own divine sense, thus he was completely unable to probe the area around him to find a dense Yang qi area.However, with his Origin of Yang established this would no longer be a problem. As long as this was created, then within a certain area, he would be able to pick up even the faintest hints of Yang qi.With his strand of World Qi moving non-stop within his chest area, Kai Yang\u2019s face became tense, he could not allow the slightest carelessness. To form his Origin of Yang was a very complicated and meticulous task, if there was any errors in the forming process, than all his previous work would go down the drain and Kai Yang would need to start over again.One hour passed, two hours passed and Kai Yang who had been sitting under the sun the entire time was soaked from head to toe in his sweat. Given the length of time he had been sweating for his body naturally began to show signs of dehydration; his lips had even turned pale, but Kai Yang\u2019s face remained firm. He continued to spur that strand of World Qi to revolve around his chest acupoint with no signs of irritability or discouragement.Without knowing how much time had passed, Kai Yang suddenly felt a strange sensation from his chest and a piercing pain followed like a red hot iron had been pressed upon his skin.Abruptly, Kai Yang opened his eyes and clenched his teeth.This pain came fast and left just as fast. It only occurred for the time it took you to blink, then his chest returned to normal. In fact, it even felt cool and refreshed, but his brain was still reeling from the severe pain and wouldn\u2019t allow him to forget about it that easily.Faintly, Kai Yang felt that something extra had appeared in his chest, but when he looked down there was nothing there.Was the Origin of Yang formed? Creasing his eyebrows, Kai Yang began to contemplate. The Origin should have been successfully formed, it was just formed within his central chest acupoint, so he couldn\u2019t see it physically.Since the Origin of Yang had formed, then it should have some reaction with the Yang qi. Why couldn\u2019t he sense it?Could it be that in this area, there was no dense areas of Yang qi?Keeping this thought in mind, Kai Yang stood up and walked towards the centre of Sky Tower. As he walked, he paid careful attention to any movement within his chest.He hadn\u2019t been walking for long when a warm feeling spread out from his chest. Kai Yang\u2019s expression jolted in surprise!It seems that this was the case. The Origin of Yang had been successfully formed and the reason why it had displayed no reaction earlier was because there was hardly any Yang qi around. Now there was a reaction, it meant that there was area with dense Yang qi in the vicinity.Kai Yang\u2019s face revealed his excitement, in order to cultivate the True Yang Tactics, there were very harsh requirements. If the density of Yang qi was high, then the speed you would be able to cultivate would also be faster. Looking back at how Kai Yang had relied on the sun\u2019s Yang qi, the speed would inherently be slow due to the low density.Follow his Origin of Yang\u2019s perception, Kai Yang madly ran and soon entered a room.As soon as he entered, a very familiar voice sounded: \u201cEh, little Kai Yang, why did you come over here at such a time?\u201dLifting up his head, Kai Yang saw that it was Treasurer Meng behind his counter looking at him strangely.I turned out that this place was the Contribution Hall!Glancing at Treasure Meng, then glancing over at the back hall, Kai Yang rolled his eyes! The origin of the Yang qi was clear, it was most definitely originating from something Yang attributed in the Contribution Hall\u2019s stock.But\u2026\u2026but this was the Contribution Hall, so if he wanted that object, then he could only obtain it by exchanging contribution points for it. Kai Yang\u2019s current balance was zero, for all of his points had been exchanged for the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass herbs!Understanding this point, Kai Yang became very disappointed. He didn\u2019t even bother to answer Treasurer Meng\u2019s question and only lowered his head dejectedly and trudged out.\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d Old man Meng also became gloomy.Walking aimlessly around Sky Tower, the Origin of Yang would occasionally have a reaction and lead him to Yang qi dense areas. But these Yang qi dense areas were either domains of powerful people or they were already in someone\u2019s bag.Kai Yang even thought about disguising himself to steal one from them, but when he looked at his small and weak physique, then looked at their strength, Kai Yang could only dispel these thoughts.Although he was unable to obtain these Yang attributed treasures, Kai Yang was not left without some gain. Through his many experiments and constant use, Kai Yang\u2019s Origin of Yang could now sense any Yang qi within five hundred feet of himself.Once his search range reached the distance of five hundred feet, he could no longer increase it. It was probably related to his own strength. Once he stepped into the next stage, this area would most likely increase again.After two or three hours of walking hurriedly around Sky Tower, Kai Yang had almost visited all the places, apart from some forbidden areas. Kai Yang had come up with no results, but thinking back, anything that the Origin of Yang could sense was most likely quite valuable. Since they were quite valuable, would they just be lying around on the road for him to find? Kai Yang\u2019s childish ideas were really too funny.Should he make another trip to Black Wind Mountains? The mountain range should have some Yang attributed things right?Just as he was considering the feasibility of this idea, the Origin of Yang within his chest heated up. Kai Yang ended up following his Origin of Yang almost by reflex, and he began walking in that direction.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34 \u2013 Coiling Dragon StreamPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHey guys! Sorry for the delayed chapter release, I had a heck load of exams this week and school finishes next week! Since my summer holidays are coming up, I've decided to take on a side project! Three Marriages [\u4e09\u5ac1\u60f9\u541b\u5fc3] by Ming Yue Ting Feng. The first 3-4ish chapters have already been translated by Inno. I will soon start to release chapters once I have them translated and sorted out. Look out for more updates then. Enjoy.Chapter 34 \u2013 Coiling Dragon StreamAfter walking for a short while, an enormous; it literally stretched across the heavens and earth, mountain stream appeared. A powerful gale blew towards him as if it was greeting him, nearly knocking him over in the process.Turning around and lifting up his head Kai Yang stared blankly ahead.How could it be here? The channel in front of him was a thousand foot wide and appeared almost bottomless it was one of the most mysterious and dangerous places in Sky Tower \u2013 Coiling Dragon Stream!Now that you mentioned it, the very existence of this mountain stream was truly strange. This was because Sky Tower wasn\u2019t even located in a mountain range, but rather on a flat piece of land. Although it was called a mountain stream, it would be more suitable to call Coiling Dragon Stream a giant crack in the earth itself. It was just that this crack was a bit too big.Coiling Dragon Stream, the most forbidden place of all the forbidden places in Sky Tower! This is because once you entered, fierce winds blew. A single moment\u2019s carelessness could cause you to slip and fall, plummeting to your death.This place was also the place were exiled or traitorous disciples were sent. In the past several hundred years, whenever a disciple committed an unforgivable act, they would be given a few rations and exiled to Coiling Dragon Stream.This made Kai Yang extremely confused. For if a disciple really committed an unforgivable act, wouldn\u2019t it better to immediately execute them rather than exiling them? Giving them a few rations and abandoning them there is equal to death itself.Of course, apart from being the place where traitorous disciples were exiled, it was also the number one choice for lovers to commit suicide.There were many such stories floating around Sky Tower. Tear jerking and heart wrenching these stories certainly were, they were about lovers who came to Coiling Dragon Stream to die when their partner had perished.In the school, each male disciple would tell one or two of these stories when they were chasing after girls. If they could make these beautiful females cry, then they would then use their broad and warm chest to comfort these crying females.You couldn\u2019t know how many hearts were stirred by these heart wrenching stories, but nevertheless they were all kept in the hearts of the male disciples when pursuing love!In regards to the information Kai Yang held on Coiling Dragon Stream, he reviewed it once more in his mind. Slowly, he took a few steps forward and looked ahead in doubt.How could there be Yang qi inside? Not to mention that this reaction was different from all the previous reactions. This time it indicated there was a very strong concentration of Yang qi and that it was also slowly drifting upwards. Even though he was standing next to this place, Kai Yang could still sense a small warm feeling from the open air.This warm feeling was not from the sun, it was several folds more pure than the sun\u2019s energy.Thinking for a while, Kai Yang ended up simply sitting down on the ground and diligently started to absorb the energy, disregarding the reason for the dense concentration of energy. To cultivate the True Yang Tactics, the more concentrated the Yang qi was in the area, the quicker you mastered it.Since his current amount of World Qi was very small, the transfer speed of his True Yang Tactics was also slow, but with all this Yang qi to aid him, his speed should be greatly increased.The sun had set and it was now evening, even without the sun\u2019s qi, Yang Kai could sense that his efficiency was much higher than it had been the past few days.With his cultivation, he had unexpectedly cultivated the entire night away. It was only the next morning, that Kai Yang opened his eyes and inspected his progress.Cultivating with Yang qi and without Yang qi, it was truly different. Although he had previously trained under the sun\u2019s light, it took him three entire days to produce that one small bit of World Qi. But with just one night\u2019s cultivation, he had already achieved the same result that took three days worth of cultivation without the aid of dense Yang qi. It truly made one speechless.The amount of World Qi within him had also increased, it was no longer like a flickering flame caught in a storm.Also, with the increase of his World Qi, his control over it had improved.Since it was the start of a new day, Kai Yang didn\u2019t continue but instead stood up to practise his half an hour of tempered body record training.Next to Coiling Dragon Stream, Kai Yang sweated profusely. Although he had trained the entire night, he didn\u2019t consume much stamina, and his mental health was bursting with vigour.After he completed his tempered body record training, he quickly went to complete his daily sweeping. Afterwards, he hurried (bounced back happily) back to Coiling Dragon Stream.Since he had just about consumed his stock of his Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and Dead Jedi Tree Grass, the incense burner was temporarily unusable. That left him with only one option of training.Originally, Kai Yang had wanted to go and find Su Mu\u2019s group and challenge them to a duel, but it was very strange. Ever since that night, Su Mu\u2019s group of people had vanished into thin air, never to be seen in Sky Tower again.Although Kai Yang had some problems with them, it wasn\u2019t to the point of utter hatred and revenge seeking. And his finding them to battle was only to find some entertainment whilst also verifying his growth. So he didn\u2019t take their night raid very seriously.If he was bullied, as long as he gained enough strength, he would retaliate and make them suffer so as to never to have the idea to come and bully him again.Sitting down next to Coiling Dragon Stream and ignoring the blistering wind, strong enough to blow a human away, Kai Yang closed his eyes and concentrated. Slowly, the World Qi within his meridians surged and started to circulate.The circulation of his World Qi felt like it was pulling out a mysterious inner power. This caused all of the pores in his body to open up and suck in the Yang qi in the air into his body; like a kitten who had just smelt a delicious fishy scent.His entire body heated up, like he was bathing in hot water, making Kai Yang feel extremely comfortable.Two days flew past and Kai Yang's work had been very rewarding.After these two days of cultivation, the World Qi inside of Kai Yang had expanded greatly. And within this World Qi was small ball of flaming Yang energy.This was a distinct characteristic of cultivating the True Yang Tactics. Since the World Qi within him grew by absorbing Yang energy, it would naturally be Yang attributed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 \u2013 The first drop of Yang liquidPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 35 \u2013 The first drop of Yang liquidKai Yang didn\u2019t know the average amount of World Qi that someone who was at the tempered body seventh stage would have, they shouldn\u2019t have as much as him though. Although the accumulation speed was very slow, the True Yang Tactics allowed him to the absorb the Yang Qi around him. How many secret methods allowed one to do such a thing?After Kai Yang finished his training, he slowly opened his eyes.Over the past few days, the accumulated Yang qi had gradually become denser and the warm feeling in his meridians had also become more and more distinct. Kai Yang felt that the absorbed Yang qi would soon reach its limit.Once he had absorbed enough to reach the limit, the Yang qi would condense into a liquid state. This liquid Yang qi would then be stored within his dantian. Such a drop of Yang qi could be then used in battle giving him access to unimaginable power which caused Kai Yang to anticipate such a time greatly.Opening his eyes, Kai Yang prepared to adjust his posture when, from his peripheral visions, he caught sight of a person standing not too far away from him. His expression changed. Since he had been so immersed in his training, he hadn\u2019t sense that person approach leaving Kai Yang to wonder when they had arrived.The person was standing off to the side and was wearing a cyan robe. His sleeves were elegant and he was tall with a straight stature, white hair, a moustache and a thin wispy goatee hung down from his chin. Looking at him his age should be about the same as the Contribution Hall\u2019s old man Meng, but their auras were vastly different.At first glance, Kai Yang felt that his brain had up and gone with the wind. This person\u2019s aura and old man Meng\u2019s lecherous hoodlum attitude starkly contrasted each other. When compared together, one was up in the heavens and the other was down in the earth.Currently, one of the man\u2019s hands was behind his back while the other one was stroking his beard while he stood over there gazing down into Coiling Dragon Stream. His gaze was very strange, it was so strange that it was even strangely complex.This man was clearly a learned sage, while also being an excellent martial elder! With this in mind, Kai Yang quickly stood up and called out the standard disciple greeting: \u201cDisciple Kai Yang has seen this senior.\u201dSurprised by Kai Yang\u2019s voice, the elderly man casually turned around and kindly looked over. Nodding his head, he replied: \u201cEn.\u201d\u201cHow should this disciple address you?\u201d Although he knew that this person was a powerful person in Sky Tower, he had never met him before. Naturally he would ask otherwise he might mix up the seniority rankings and address him incorrectly.Muttering to himself, the elderly man\u2019s eyebrows knitted together as if Kai Yang had asked him an exceedingly difficult question. After a good while he said: \u201cYou can just address me as the eleventh elder.\u201dEleventh elder? This caused Kai Yang to become slightly suspicious. Although there were a few elders in Sky Tower, there couldn\u2019t be an eleventh elder. But all in all, this person was his senior so if he wished to be called that, then Kai Yang could only comply. Immediately he paid his respects. \u201cThis disciple greets the eleventh elder.\u201dThe eleventh elder smiled and his expression became kinder, gently he asked: \u201cAre you practising your martial skill?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Kai Yang nodded his head.\u201cAnd it\u2019s a Yang attributed martial skill?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The opposite party\u2019s strength was definitely not weak, otherwise how could he sense Kai Yang absorbing the Yang qi to cultivate?\u201cHow is your progress?\u201d\u201cIt has only been a few days since I started practising so the progress is not bad.\u201dEleventh elder once again asked a few more questions and Kai Yang responded to each one, with his heart slightly moved. This elder was very amiable and gentle, since he treated such a low levelled disciple with such care, easily allowing one to have a good impression of him.With great care, Kai Yang thought of a question to ask. \u201cEleventh elder, after practising for a couple of days, there is something this disciple doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cOh, say it so that I may hear it.\u201d The elders spirits were suddenly aroused.\u201cWhy is there Yang qi rising out from below Coiling Dragon Stream?\u201dLaughing for a bit, Eleventh elder replied: \u201cThe answer would be that there is a Yang attributed treasure located down there.\u201dKai Yang didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry, for this he could naturally guess. He just had no idea as to what that treasure was.\u201cDo you know how this Coiling Dragon Stream was formed?\u201d Eleventh elder suddenly asked a random question.Although Kai Yang didn\u2019t know the senior\u2019s intention he could only shake his head.Gazing towards Coiling Dragon Stream, the eleventh elder calmly said: \u201cThis was created by a someone\u2019s sword strike.\u201d(TL: \\OoO/)Kai Yang\u2019s heart shook like thunder! Coiling Dragon Stream exceeded at least a couple of thousand feet in length, it was unfathomably deep yet it was unexpectedly created by someone\u2019s sword strike? If it had been another person who had told him this, he wouldn\u2019t have believed them. However the person who had told was the eleventh elder, and there wouldn't be any reason for him to lie to him.But, what type of person was able to create such a rift with a single sword strike? And what level of cultivation had this person reached?\u201cSeveral hundred year ago, this was not Sky Tower.\u201d The elder\u2019s eyes grew distant and seemed to contain a hidden depth, his voice became lower.Kai Yang knew that this senior was going to reveal some secret or hidden affair, and held his breath in rapt attention, staring intently at the elder.\u201cBack then, when the founder passed through this land, he met a profound monster by chance. Here, those two fought a great battle. The details of the battle, no one knows, but towards the end, the intelligence of that monster wasn\u2019t low, he took out a sword.\u201d As he narrated the story, the eleventh elder also was using his hands to gesture around the east and west directions of Coiling Dragon Stream. \u201cWith one strike for the sword Coiling Dragon Stream was created! *Dun dun duuuuun!!!!* The monster then escaped inside, with the founder pursuing closely behind. With great effort and suffering equal hardship the founder managed to kill and behead that monster!\u201d\u201cBut that monster\u2019s strength was too profound and when he died, his spirit vanished into thin air. However the founder was not relieved, so he founded Sky Tower here and guarded Coiling Dragon Stream for some years. Once he confirmed that nothing associated with the monsters spirit would arise again, he floated up and left. This is the origin of Sky Tower.\u201cCoiling Dragon Stream has already existed for a few hundred years, and it's bottom is pitch black, unreachable even by the sun\u2019s light. After the founder left many disciples who broke the school's rules were sent there, which resulted in the rare birth of a Yang attributed treasure, from which you have been absorbing Yang qi.\u201dNodding his, Kai Yang asked doubtfully: \u201cEleventh elders purpose of coming here is also to go and see this treasure?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d The eleventh elder\u2019s expression became queer, shaking his head slowly he said: \u201cI didn\u2019t come here for the treasure, but instead to meet someone.\u201d\u201cMeet someone?\u201dLaughing he replied: \u201cAs I\u2019ve grown older, I find I speak more frequently. Let us end our conversation here for now, continue to diligently practise, but do not have any ideas about descending down there. There are many dangers down there, and even I do not dare to go down there casually.\u201dAs he had finished speaking, the eleventh elder left. Kai Yang\u2019s heart and mind were both touched, he was left with a lot of doubts and unanswered questions but he could only keep them to himself.Calming his mind down, Kai Yang continued the circulation of his True Yang Tactics. Now when he used his True Yang Tactics, the absorption speed of Yang qi was many folds quicker than it had been in the previous few days.(TL: Don\u2019t always train! Go find Xia Ning to bother! Learn from Linley &amp; Bebe! They train and have a life. Got reprimanded by Ben for recommending Yun Che as a role model. T_T)A few hours later, Kai Yang felt that that his meridians were bursting, even his dantian was packed to the brim. It was like eating too much during a meal, so much so that you felt like your stomach was bursting.Was it at the limit? Kai Yang was not surprised, and steeling his resolve he continued.Half an hour later, his meridians and dantian suddenly became light and that bursting feeling he had earlier disappeared without a trace. All of his World Qi had charged into his dantian and compressed into a scorching hot liquid which slowly formed into a single drop. When that drop entered his dantian, Kai Yang heard the light sound of water dripping.Liquid Yang! He had finally formed a drop of Yang liquid!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 \u2013 The beauty beneath the moonPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt's me again! So now I will attempt to post 1 chapter everyday, with a minimum of three regular chapters a week. \\-o-\\ Enjoy.Chapter 36 \u2013 The beauty beneath the moonAlthough his current training was not enough for him to develop his divine sense, Kai Yang could still distinctly feel that drop of Yang liquid within his dantian. With a single thought, the Yang drop began to move.This Yang liquid was usable during a battle, but Kai Yang had yet to test it out. In the end, the black book\u2019s explanation was not enough, so he needed test it out first hand to gauge its true potential.Although he had suffered many days of hardships to reach this point, with the creation of this singular drop of Yang liquid, Kai Yang felt content. With a heart full of excitement, he settled down and cultivated most of the night away.During the latter part of the night, Kai Yang opened his eyes and stopped cultivating.In these past few days, he had constantly skipped his meals and gone without sleep. Although this had brought about great results in regards to his cultivation, it had placed a great strain on his body. In order to cultivate well, you must do all things in moderation in order to avoid long term dangers.Standing up, he patted his bottom clean of dirt and walked lightly back to his wooden hut.When he arrived, the door to his wooden hut was ajar, alerting Kai Yang. When he had left, he distinctly remembered that he had closed the door.Cautiously he walked over and softly pushed open the door. Peering inside, the scene that awaited him momentarily stunned Kai Yang. It was like it had been taken directly out of a painting, something from a dream or fantasy. It was that otherwordly.Inside his wooden hut, there was really only his bed. And on his bed slept a person, more specifically a female.With the moonlight pouring into the room via the hole in the roof it fell onto the female asleep on the bed. With the moonlight illuminating the room, Kai Yang saw that both her hands were folded neatly and were placed on her stomach and her well-rounded chest moved up and down rhythmically in tune with her breaths. Under the moonlight, the neck and skin of the lady was as white as sparkling ice, it was accompanied by silky, onyx black hair that spread out around her head. Her shoulders made her seem delicate and fragile, while her earlobes excluded a kind of temptation.(TL: This author\u2019s tastes are weird. First [hairy] legs, now earlobes. :\\)Because she was laying down, her slim legs, her slender waist and her beautiful body were displayed to Kai Yang in full. He couldn\u2019t see her face due to the cicada thin veil she wore, but on her sleek forehead, there rested a blue gem. This was the only piece of jewellery she wore and although it was not that expensive, he thought it perfectly complimented and highlighted her frosty and pure aura.The hazy moonlight illuminating the room seemed to enhance her beauty as well.She looked as if she was an immortal from the Moon Palace, for from head to toe, there was not a single flaw to be seen and not a single part of her didn\u2019t emit a divine aura. She lay there comfortably, as if she would never wake. Unable to make sense of the situation, Kai Yang\u2019s heart soared.Usually Kai Yang wasn\u2019t an emotional person, but this picturesque scene moved him greatly. Even if tens of years passed, he would never forget this scene.Curious, Kai Yang cautiously walked over, forcibly suppressing his breathing and heartrate, afraid that they might wake her.Drawing closer to the bedside, the distance between them was now very short, Kai Yang hurriedly observed the situation. He discovered that it was the same as his guess; this female was the same female disciple that had nearly bumped into him outside the Contribution Hall the other day.(TL: YAY! It was Xia Ning Chang! Isn\u2019t everybody happy? :D)It was just that her aura that day was completely different to the one she was exuding here and now, currently she exuded a divine and untouchable aura. That day, she appeared shy and timid, with a fresh and adorable feel. Raising his head, Kai Yang took a look towards the hole in the roof and chuckled softly. These past few days the holes that he had never gotten a chance to fix had unexpectedly become very handy.This series of small laughs alarmed Xia Ning Chang who was currently laying on the bed. By the time Kai Yang lowered his head, the sleeping senior sister had long since woken and was staring at him with wide eyes.That pair of bright eyes first held some confusion before becoming flustered and embarrassed. In the blink of an eye, Xia Ning Chang\u2019s earlobes had become bright red.Luckily it was night, and although there was moonlight illuminating the hut, Kai Yang still couldn\u2019t see too clearly thus allowing Xia Ning Chang escape embarrassment.The two people eyed each other, one on the bed and the other beside it.Kai Yang\u2019s belly was full of suspicions, meanwhile Xia Ning Chang wished that she could slap herself unconscious and escape an awkward situation. Her heart was in a mess, she did not think that she would be so careless and fall asleep here.\u201cKe, ke\u2026\u2026\u201d Kai Yang coughed lightly, and tried very hard to make himself appear somewhat good natured as he asked: \u201cFellow senior sister, how should I call you?\u201dIt was unclear whether it was it due to the current mood or situation, but when Kai Yang asked that question, it didn\u2019t seem quite right. Especially when a young male and female were together in a room during the night.The question asked was like he was asking: \u201cHow should I call this prostitute/concubine.\u201dA hundred percent tasteless.Xia Ning Chang\u2019s face was as red as blood, but she calmly got up and sat on the bed. Reaching out her hand, she went to tidy her hair before saying: \u201cI am surnamed Xia\u2026\u2026\u201dXia Ning Chang did not have the nerve to give her full name, for today she felt that she had lost too much face.\u201cSo it\u2019s actually senior sister Xia. What can I do for senior sister Xia?\u201dIf there was nothing she need from him then why would this deity like female come to his hut to look for him?Under Kai Yang\u2019s questioning, Xia Ning Chang remembered her original purpose and hurriedly took out a package from her side. With her emotions calmed, she said: \u201cThis afternoon, there was a hunter from Black Wind Mountains who came to find you. He waited until sundown, but you had yet to appear. I saw that he was in a hurry to return home, so I went to talk to him. That hunter said that he was very grateful to you for saving his life and asked me to pass on this package to you, and he also said that in the future he would come to personally thank you.\u201dHearing her say this, Kai Yang was left at a loss for words for he knew who that person was.The hunter from the mountains! Last time when he had entered Black Wind Mountains, he had saved both the father and son\u2019s lives.Reaching out, Kai Yang accepted the package. Nodding his head, he said: \u201cOh so it was like this.\u201dSecretly, Xia Ning Chang raised her eyes and glanced over at him and asked: \u201cI was entrusted with something of yours, and had waited nearly the whole day for you to come back, yet you\u2026\u2026..\u201dAnd as she waited she fell asleep\u2026..she didn\u2019t have the guts to say that out loud. This was too frustrating for her and she had also unexpectedly fallen asleep in another\u2019s bed.Kai Yang already fully understand today\u2019s affair, laughing out loud (lol) he said: \u201cI have troubled senior sister, so next time I will make sure to come back earlier.\u201dXia Ning Chang didn\u2019t know if it was her own misconception or if the other party had purposely phrased it like that. No matter what, it sounded weird, like a husband promising his wife something.Nibbling her lip, Xia Ning Chang replied with some dissatisfaction: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you come late or early, the package has already been handed over to you. I shall take my leave now.\u201dFinishing her sentence, with the swaying of her hips and the stamping of her foot, her figure soon disappeared, leaving only a sweet fragrance behind in the room and around a particular person\u2019s nose.This senior sister Xia, was really too shy.Thinking about that scene, Kai Yang felt a warm feeling. Turning around, Kai Yang went to open the package left behind by the hunter. Opening it, Kai Yang found that it contained two cyan coloured long gowns.These gowns were made stitch by stitch, thread by thread and the needlework was dense and clustered; the handiwork was very meticulous. Kai Yang concluded that it was the hunter\u2019s wife who had made these gowns.The hunter has such a kind heart! Last time when he was battling the flower patterned spider, his clothes had been shredded to pieces. And it was because of that, the hunter had come today to deliver two sets of clothes for him to wear.Smiling faintly, Kai Yang put the clothes away and lay onto the bed.That night, Kai Yang slept soundly.p.s. in response to some the questions and comments, Ben said that Yun Che is not a good \"love\" role model. With one girl here, one girl there, someone there and another over there. He has a good point though.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 \u2013 The written challengePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 37 \u2013 The written challengeThe next day, Kai Yang was awoken by a light knocking on his door.By the time he had crawled out of bed and opened the door, there was nobody outside. But in the distance, a familiar body figure could be seen rapidly running away.Li Yun Tian\u2019s figure!(TL: He didn\u2019t die. ED: Sadly)What is this guy up to? Perplexed, Kai Yang didn\u2019t know what to think until he noticed a letter had been placed on his doorstep. Opening the letter, he read the contents and was unsure whether to laugh or cry.There were a few words written on the letter however they were written in blood.\u201cDear senior brother, long time no see. I hope that senior brother would be generous enough to comply to this junior brother\u2019s wishes and come to Black Wind Forest.\u201dBright red these words were, there could be no doubt these words were written in blood. He just didn\u2019t know whether it was chicken blood or a person's blood, however Kai Yang was certain it was not Su Mu\u2019s.On the back, there was another row of words and these were far more crude and vulgar than the first message.\u201cIf you have the guts, then come!\u201dThese couple of words conveyed the great arrogance of the writer, clearly displaying the extreme hatred the writer had while simultaneously acting as provocation.It was probably because Su Mu was afraid that his invitation would be rejected by Kai Yang, so he added an extra sentence on the back to attempt to provoke him into action. Young people were often hot-blooded and Su Mu had experienced this many times already. He was already long used to this and was very experienced with regards to using it to his advantage.Scrunching up the bloody letter in his hand, Kai Yang slowly shook his head.In regards to Su Mu\u2019s provocation, Kai Yang didn\u2019t take it too seriously. Perhaps Su Mu really had some grudge against him, but Kai Yang was different; his mentality was different, his goal was different. With regards to these type of small scale issues, Kai Yang only treated them as an opportunity to measure his development and aid him in his training.Although the first few meetings between him and Su Mu were unpleasant affairs, through his constant interactions with him later, Kai Yang had discovered that Su Mu wasn\u2019t really that bad. He just had major dandyism issues.If you were to develop good relations with this type of person, then they would treat you really well. But if you were to become enemies, they would become like maggots on rotting bones, pestering you to no end.These past few days, he hadn\u2019t seen a hint of Su Mu\u2019s group, they were probably hiding from him. He didn\u2019t know why they suddenly wanted to duel him again and came running over to issue a letter of challenge.Originally, Kai Yang didn\u2019t want to pay too much attention to Su Mu, but when he was doing his daily sweeping he thought about the challenge and decided to go.Su Mu was undoubtedly a petty person, and had chosen to ignore the Main Gate\u2019s rules with regards to issuing a challenge and instead used a letter to issue his challenge. He probably intended to make his fight a group one rather than an individual one as per the Main Gate\u2019s rules.The selected location also raised many questions. Black Wind Forest was located at the base of the Black Wind Mountains, it was a pine forest and as such a great place to dispose of a person.Although the group of people who hung out with Su Mu didn\u2019t number that many, only Su Mu had reached the tempered body ninth stage. Li Yun Tian was at the tempered body seventh stage, while the rest were either at the fifth or sixth stages. Kai Yang didn\u2019t know whether or not he could win, but he really needed a proper battle in order to fully understand his current progress. Not the kind that disciples usually held!Currently, Su Mu was personally waiting on Sky Tower\u2019s road towards the Black Wind Forest, not a single person was hidden in ambush. He stood there valiantly, full of vigor he stood there.When he thought about his failure a few nights ago, his fully unconscious embarrassing state, Su Mu\u2019s face became really ugly. That night, he didn\u2019t even know what had happened, all his fellow disciple brothers who had come with him to Kai Yang\u2019s small wooden hut had fainted suddenly. It had happened all too suddenly and mysteriously.It wasn\u2019t until the next morning, that they managed to wake up. Although it was summer and sleeping outside wouldn\u2019t do them any harm, there were still a lot of mosquitoes. When they woke up, everybody felt like a couple of hundred bumps had formed all over their bodies; an unfathomable amount of mosquitoes had bitten them and drank their blood while they dreamt.(TLer: Here come da mozzies, ;))The following couple of days, Su Mu\u2019s group had all been bedridden and were in a extremely weakened state.After they had healed, all the disciple Su Mu had taken under his wing had run away from Sky Tower. If they couldn\u2019t afford to offend Kai Yang, then why couldn\u2019t they run away instead?Yesterday when he was informed that Li Yun Tian had learnt his first martial skill, Su Mu\u2019s flame of revenge was once again ignited. So he sent Li Yun Tian to give Kai Yang a letter of challenge with the fight to be held in Black Wind forest.The reason why this duel wasn\u2019t held in Sky Tower was because Su Mu didn\u2019t have a lot of faith in Li Yun Tian. If Li Yun Tian were to once again lose to Kai Yang miserably, then the remaining people would flock to spectate. What Main Gate rules, to hell with the rules, for he only wanted to beat Kai Yang until he looked like a pig. If he couldn\u2019t release this resentment within him, then he would surely lose his head.Just as he was thinking about this, Li Yun Tian hurriedly rushed over.\u201cDid you deliver it?\u201d Su Mu asked, a fierce light in his eyes.\u201cEn.\u201d\u201cGood, then let\u2019s wait for that bastard to come.\u201dThere he waited, but no matter how long he waited, Kai Yang did not appear. Su Mu\u2019s face showed his impatience as he paced about before finally asking: \u201cCould it be that, that bastard didn\u2019t have the courage to come here?\u201dJust as he swore, Li Yun Tian cried out abruptly. \u201cYoung master Su, someone is walking over here.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d His mind shaking, for he thought that Kai Yang had really come over in search of death. When he went to look, the person who was walking over was not Kai Yang.\u201cYoung master Su, it\u2019s people from the Storm House.\u201d Li Yun Tian reported as he continued to observe the approaching group. \u201cAnd the lead person seems to be Cheng Shao Feng!\u201d\u201cCheng Shao Feng?\u201d Su Mu\u2019s expression became cold as he turned his head to look at the incoming group. It really was Storm House\u2019s Cheng Shao Feng who was leading a group of people, they arrogantly approach Su Mu.\u201cYoung master Su, do you want to take a walk and avoid them?\u201d Li Yun Tian asked hesitatingly, for he knew that between Su Mu and that Cheng Shao Feng, there was some history. Both of them were cultivators at the peak of the tempered body stage and had crossed paths many times over these past years, with about the same amount of wins and losses belonging to each. If they were to meet right now, there would certainly be some friction.\u201cAvoid what?\u201d Su Mu responded coldly: \u201cDoes he have the qualifications to make this lord move for him?\u201dLi Yun Tian didn\u2019t reply, for he knew that this matter was related to one\u2019s face for these two. Su Mu was a very proud person, how could he possibly move aside for another? But the number of people in the opposite party was quite a lot, so if they really started to fight then his side would suffer.As they were speaking, Cheng Shao Feng had already spotted them from afar, and his expression immediately became cheery and he said some things to the people following behind him. Their pace noticeably hastened.Not long after, the two parties met up with each other. Although Su Mu\u2019s group was occupying the road that lead to Black Wind Forest, this road was a four-way intersection that also lead to the residences of Storm House and the Blood Group. It also continued throughout the whole of Sky Tower and it\u2019s various buildings.With the positioning of Su Mu\u2019s group, it was equivalent to blocking Cheng Shao Feng\u2019s path.\u201cI didn\u2019t know who it was that dared to block my way, but it turns out it was actually Su Mu!\u201d Walking up, Cheng Shao Feng looked down at Su Mu in contempt while sizing him up. His voice was slightly mystifying.Su Mu just rolled his eyes and continued to stand there with a back as straight as a javelin stick. He wasn\u2019t even in the mood to bother with him.This blatant disregard made Cheng Shao Feng somewhat displeased.\u201cGe, ge, ge, younger brother Cheng, they are ignoring you.\u201d A tender voice sounded, it was pleasant to hear, but gave one a unrestrained feeling.Following the sound of the voice, Su Mu looked over to see a lovely looking young lady standing behind Cheng Shao Feng. This young lady wore a loose jacket with a hint of her pink shoulder showing, while emitting a porcelain doll-like aura. Her skirt barely covered her bottom, revealing half of her **, her white legs were also revealed and her jade-like feet were enclosed in a pair of wooden shoes. Small and exquisite jewel like sparkling fingers were accompanied by a pair of seductive eyes.p.s. The author actually wrote ** in the raws, so I don\u2019t really know or want to know what ** means, I want to keep my innocence. And I\u2019m already hating Cheng Shao Feng and that girl with all my heart now. Kai Yang hurry up and appear to help Su Mu beat up these pompous people!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38 \u2013 Hu Mei ErPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 38 \u2013 Hu Mei ErThe young lady and Su Mu\u2019s ages weren\u2019t that far apart, but the way she walked was much more adult with her hips swaying seductively. With a thousand different techniques to seduce bursts of ferocious waves were coming from her chest making all those who saw her faint-headed.At such a young age, she already had the air of a mature woman. It was just that this air had yet to fully develop, so it seemed a bit unnatural.\u201cHu Mei Er!\u201d When he saw this young lady, Su Mu\u2019s expression couldn\u2019t help but change, his mouth widened into a smile, and his gaze swept across her body. Unconsciously he swallowed a mouthful of saliva.(TL: Lol, her name literally means Hu Enchantress. STOP GAWKING SU MU! You\u2019re embarrassing.)Even Su Mu had reacted to such a degree, let alone others with less self control like Li Yun Tian.Every pair of eyes were like the eyes of dragonflies and locusts, glued onto Hu Mei Er\u2019s body. As they stared at that well developed figure, their breathing gradually became ragged and their shameful inner selves were revealed. Although, throughout the lands, pretty boys and girls were not scarce, those of exceptional beauty like Hu Mei Er were exceedingly rare. Not to mention that she was only a fifteen-sixteen year old girl and still had skin so tender it was out of reach even for those using the latest nivea skin creams, which just added lethality to her body\u2019s killing power.Li Yun Tian and the others were only boys still in puberty, adding to that their vigourous qi/energy, so when they saw such a stimulating scene, their reaction was imaginable.But the various reactions of the boys from the Sky Tower\u2019s Pavilion didn\u2019t enrage or disgust Hu Mei Er, to the contrary, she seemed to enjoy their reactions. Placing her hand cutely on her mouth, she said: \u201c(BITCH Please! \u2013 didn\u2019t say it, not really) It seems that younger brother Su recognises this older sister?\u201dSu Mu coughed a bit and forced himself to straighten up his expression. With his face a bit red he replied: \u201cNaturally I recognise you.\u201dCheng Shao Feng was the leader of the tempered body practitioners at Storm House, while this Hu Mei Er was the leader for them at the Blood Group, and this female\u2019s personal status was not ordinary. For she was the daughter of the master of Blood Group.It was just her reputation wasn\u2019t very good, not to mention that the master of Blood Group, Hu Man, did not control her and allowed her to act however she wished. Although Hu Mei Er was still young, the number of people that she controlled was vast.Only today, the reason why she was walking with Cheng Shao Feng was a mystery. Could it be, that he had also come under her wing?Thinking of that, Su Mu became endlessly envious. Previously he had been envious over Cheng Shao Feng\u2019s luck with women, but now he had been subdued by a woman.When he thought about that, not only did a strange smile appear on Su\u2019s face but when he glanced over to Cheng Shao Feng again, a look of contempt appeared on his face.His gaze made Cheng Shao Feng extremely uncomfortable, while the Sky Tower Pavilion people\u2019s eyes were still glued on Hu Mei Er\u2019s body spinning around in circles Su Mu was staring at him, and put him in a bad mood. At that moment, he took a few steps forward and cut off their view of Hu Mei Er.This seemingly casual movement, caused Hu Mei Er to purse her lips in amusement.\u201cSu Mu, tell your people to make way.\u201d Cheng Shao Feng said with a gloomy face; he didn\u2019t even bother to say a few words of courtesy.Su Mu only hehe sneered: \u201cThe great road goes to the sky, each one walks their own path. So how could we be blocking your way?\u201d(TL: Hehe is like a sound effect that the author included, I did too since it sounds kind of funny.)\u201cYes!\u201d Cheng Shao Feng replied with a hazy expression.\u201cWhat if I do not move aside?\u201d A measure for a measure Su Mu asked, for the tension and friction between the two people was not the kind developed overnight. Due to this, they were each far too clear on each other\u2019s methods, so what did Su Mu have to fear?\u201cYounger brother Cheng, younger brother Su standing here is nothing important, we can just take a detour. No one will say anything about you.\u201d Hu Mei Er suddenly butted in and said. It looked like she was trying to peacefully resolve the problem, but in reality, she was fanning the flames.Su Mu secretly called her a slut, for this woman\u2019s mind really was too sinister. As soon as she became a member of Blood Group, she was all too eager for the animosity between Sky Tower Pavilion and Storm House to reach the boiling point and for a fight to erupt.As Cheng Shao Feng heard Hu Mei Er\u2019s words, his originally hesitant expression instantly hardened and became decisive. Sneering he said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t fuck off now, you will regret it.\u201dHe purposely acted tough in front of Hu Mei Er. How could he back down now?The corners of Hu Mei Er\u2019s mouth twitched into a smile, while she watched the two people with a gaze full of interest, while taking a few steps back in expectation.\u201cIf you have the guts, come and try!\u201d Su Mu laughed coldly back at Cheng Shao Feng, while Li Yun Tian and the others stepped up behind him.\u201cYou brought this upon yourself.\u201d Laughing suddenly, Cheng Shao Feng waved his arm ushering everybody behind him forward. \u201cCharge!\u201dHis voice firm, Cheng Shao Feng rushed out towards Su Mu while throwing out a fist at Su Mu\u2019s face. Su Mu laughed and responded with a palm.At the moment of the collision, Su Mu was pushed back a dozen or so steps before he managed to steady himself, while Cheng Shao Feng had a calm look. His body remained still.\u201cDid you breakthrough into the Kai Yuan Stage?\u201d Su Mu\u2019s face changed greatly, for when they had exchanged fists, the World Qi that Su Mu felt from Cheng Shao Feng was stronger and denser than his own measly tempered body ninth stage World Qi. This was clearly strength gained from breaking through to the Kai Yuan Stage.Cheng Shao Feng continued to charge towards Su Mu, all the while smiling incessantly. \u201cSu Mu, you and I started cultivating at the same time, but there are great differences between people. From now on you, Su Mu, can only follow I, Cheng Shao Feng\u2019s steps. You can only eternally dream of surpassing me.\u201dSu Mu\u2019s face became ashen with despair, his heart bitter and agonised. The feeling of defeat that Su Mu experienced from Cheng Shao Feng was many times worse than being defeated by Kai Yang. In a moment, Cheng Shao Feng had nearly reached him, turning his body around Su Mu didn\u2019t dare get any ideas. The tempered body ninth stage was strong, but it was clearly insufficient to defend against the strength of the Kai Yuan Stage of Cheng Shao Feng.Before Kai Yang even arrived at Black Wind Forest, he could already hear the sounds of battle from afar. Mixed within the sounds, were the cursings and swearing of Li Yun Tian\u2019s bunch, full of humiliation and mourning.Straining his ears, he listened for a while, Kai Yang felt that something was amiss. It sounded like Su Mu\u2019s group of people had met some type of trouble.Coming to this conclusion, Kai Yang hastened his pace. When he arrived at that four-way intersection, he surprisingly found Su Mu bloody nosed and with a swollen face, laying on the ground. While a youngster sat on top of him while beating him, with Li Yun Tian and the others clustered around Su Mu. They used all their strength to protect themselves, but it was no use since the amount of people on the opponent's side was too great and their accumulated strength was vastly superior. The disciples of Sky Tower Pavilion were already preoccupied with battle, so how could they pay attention to Su Mu?\u201cSubmit or not?\u201d Cheng Shao Feng slammed one fist down onto Su Mu\u2019s eye. Su Mu\u2019s eye socket had already long since split apart, blood was dripping out.\u201cSubmit to hell!\u201d Su Mu spat out a thin streak of blood towards Cheng Shao Feng\u2019s face.\u201cSubmit or not?\u201d He asked again, while slamming another fist down, this time on Su Mu\u2019s cheekbone area and causing it to swell up.\u201cI submit\u2026.I submit to your ancestors!\u201d Su Mu was gasping for breath, yet he was still spitting out sharp phrases.\u201cSubmit or not?\u201d\u201cSubmit to your grandmother\u2019s butt!\u201dCheng Shao Feng didn\u2019t waste any more words, he just sent out a fist before asking \u201cSubmit or not?\u201d. While Su Mu continuously replied with poisonous curse phrases, causing Cheng Shao Feng\u2019s fists to become heavier and heavier, more and more vicious.Kai Yang just stood afar, calmly observing the scene. He found out how much guts and courage Su Mu possessed, and watching Su Mu like this reminded him of his old self when he met an enemy he couldn\u2019t defeat; although their bodies were littered with wounds, they did not submit.This was not being foolish, but being unyielding!Originally, Kai Yang didn\u2019t plan on interfering, and he didn\u2019t know which person Su Mu had offended, subduing him without even room to retaliate.But Su Mu\u2019s current unyielding character made Kai Yang approve of him a bit.At that moment, Cheng Shao Feng also became tired from the constant beating, although Su Mu was bloodied and swollen faced under him with broken eye sockets and mouth full of blood, the utter contempt and despise in his face and eyes had not diminished at all.Hu Mei Er once again timely butted in: \u201cYounger brother Cheng, why don\u2019t you spare him for younger brother Su has an unyielding character and this big sister just adores such types of people.\u201dAs soon as this was said, Su Mu twisted his head around and swore out: \u201cShameless whore!\u201dCheng Shao Feng hehe sneered back: \u201cHas an unyielding character? I also like it!\u201dAs he said this, he casually picked up a stone off from the ground, a pointed it at Su Mu\u2019s head.p.s. Okay, who else was utterly pissed at Hu Mei Er? Say 'aye' if you agree. I waster so much of my time tl-ing crap about how she looked and she turned out to be such a bitch. Poor Su Mu, and I guess now it's time for Kai Yang to make an appearance and lend Su Mu a helping hand! I guess the next chapter will be more interesting and less infuriating?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 \u2013 Battle!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 39 \u2013 Battle!Su Mu\u2019s gazed at Cheng Shao Feng with venomous eyes, without batting an eye, he spat out: \u201cCheng Shao Feng, if you don\u2019t kill this young master today, then this young master will never let it go!\u201d\u201cYou are still so foul-mouthed!\u201d The last remaining bit of guilt Cheng Shao Feng possessed was now overshadowed by his rage, as he ruthlessly slammed the stone downwards. This time, if the stone managed to land on his head, if Su Mu didn\u2019t die, then at the very least he would be heavily injured.\u201cYoung master Su!\u201d Li Yun Tian and the others cried out helplessly as they lay on the ground clutching their heads, they resigned themselves to their fate of having the disciples from Storm House viciously kick their bodies,A flash of amazement passed through Hu Mei Er\u2019s eyes, her heart couldn\u2019t help but throb continuously. It had only been a disagreement between junior disciples but a disciple bashing another's brain was different, she hadn\u2019t imagined that things would escalate to this level. If Su Mu really died here, with his status, then Sky Tower Pavilion and Storm house would be at each other's throats in enmity.Everyone\u2019s thoughts were different, but they were all conjugated at the stone in Cheng Shao Feng\u2019s hand.As they watched the stone slowly approach Su Mu\u2019s face, an extremely thin hand suddenly shot forward and blocked the stone\u2019s path. That hand didn\u2019t seem all that strong, it even looked thinner than average, and as the tip of the stone collided with that hand, it split the hand open and a stream of blood gushed out.With the stone\u2019s path obstructed by that hand, it ensured that Su Mu suffered no further harm from it.With this near fatal strike stopped, the tense hearts of Li Yun Tian and the others immediately released a breathe of relief. Anxiously they lifted up their heads, as they wanted to see who it was that had managed to stop that stone at such a crucial moment. But when they saw that person\u2019s face, their expressions turned into ones of shock and embarrassment.\u201cSenior Kai?\u201d Li Yun Tian cried out, for out of all the possibilities, he would never have imagined that the saviour was in fact Kai Yang; the person they had previously planned to ambush and beat up. At that moment, Li Yun Tian was ashamed and unable to show his face.The ruckus quickly settled down, the Storm House disciples stopped their kicking, and the victims, the Sky Tower disciples, took the opportunity to recover.Standing to the side, Hu Mei Er\u2019s small mouth was open, she was somewhat in shock as she stared at Kai Yang. She discovered that even though this thin figured young man\u2019s hand was overflowing with blood, his brow hadn\u2019t even crinkled nor had his expression changed from the pain. On the contrary, his face showed signs of excitement and anticipation, his pair of sparkling eyes held a savage glint.Not knowing why, Hu Mei Er suddenly felt that this person was dangerous.Drip drip\u2026\u2026\u2026..drip drip\u2026\u2026\u2026The dark red blood dripped down his fingers towards the ground, breaking the ensuing silence.Cheng Shao Feng\u2019s expression was concentrated fully on Kai Yang, coldly he asked: \u201cAre you a disciple from Sky Tower Pavilion?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Kai Yang nodded his head, while the familiar stabs of pain stimulated him further and made the blood throughout his body boil in excitement; itching to battle and caused him to be impatient as he tried to calm the surges of adrenaline.\u201cWhat is your motive in meddling in other people\u2019s business?\u201d Condescending was Cheng Shao Feng\u2019s tone, while the other Storm House disciples smiled arrogantly, and went to slowly enclose and trap Li Yun Tian and the others.\u201cOther people\u2019s business?\u201d Kai Yang grinned lazily, \u201cYou have already said I was a disciple of Sky Tower Pavilion, so how is this considered meddling? Even if that doesn\u2019t count, they still call me senior.\u201d\u201cGood, another one has delivered themselves.\u201d Cheng Shao Feng heartily laughed: \u201cEven Laozi, can\u2019t bear to watch you Sky Tower Pavilion disciples!\u201d(TLN: Laozi is a Chinese Philosopher and founder of Taoism. A pacifist type person, who influenced future politicians to be more like him, helping the weak, but Cheng Shao\u2019s saying that even this miserable state would make Laozi feel pity.)\u201cLeave quickly senior Kai!\u201d Crawling on the ground, Li Yun Tian cried out loudly, \u201cThey have too many people so you aren\u2019t their match, leave quickly\u2026..\u201dLi Yun Tian was quite unfortunate, for his current position was closer to the disciples from Storm House. And since he was making such a ruckus, a bored Storm House disciple walked up and chopped down on his neck and silenced him.While Cheng Shao Feng and Kai Yang were exchanging words, they were bickering with their words and also with that stone. Cheng Shao Feng forcibly used all his strength, but it was like the stone had grown hands, and was clutching onto Kai Yang\u2019s hands.Cheng Shao Feng was had already reached the Kai Yuan Stage, while the figure in front of him was skinny and lanky; a simple breeze could blow him over and to top it off this Sky Tower Pavilion disciple was only at the tempered body level, there was no way such a person could win against him, Cheng Shao Feng. This caused his mind to flare up in anger.Immediately he released his hold and called out: \u201cBeat him for me!\u201dThe surrounding Storm House disciples heard the command, and threw themselves towards Kai Yang. Promptly Kai Yang moved his body, still clutching the stone that was dyed blood red and threw the stone towards a nearby Storm House disciple.No matter what, this fist of Kai Yang\u2019s couldn\u2019t match up to a weapon, but even though he only held a stone, it was still mightier than a simple fist. Taking the opportunity, before the Storm House disciple reached Kai Yang, he was assaulted viciously on the head by that stone. It cut open the side of his head, revealing the red flesh beneath, while he fell to the ground.Even though he had hit a person, Kai Yang didn\u2019t stop there, infact his movements became sharper and sharper. Like a hawk closing in on a rabbit, he did to same to another Storm House disciple.Kai Yang\u2019s strikes were very fierce, his methods cruel and far from what anyone had imagined.In an instant, he had dealt with four Storm House disciples, meanwhile the stone had now crumbled to pieces. Throwing out another fist, the stone bits flew out like hidden weapons, dense and closely packed, the stone bits flew out in all directions.A wave of miserable cries rang out from the Storm House disciples clutching their cheeks, for no small amount of people had been injured as they hissed and cried out in pain.Taking advantage of the opportunity, Kai Yang threw out two more kicks and sent two more disciples flying away, but he had also started to be drowned by the remaining people.The amount of Storm House disciples was not a small amount, and although Kai Yang had dispatched a couple of people, it was still difficult to match up against enemies from all four directions.Ping pang ping pang the strikes collided, Kai Yang seemed to stumble, meanwhile a few more Storm House disciples collapsed, their bodies scalding with red hot pain. The True Yang Tactics that Kai Yang had cultivated had finally, at that moment displayed its might. All of his fists and kicks were enveloped in Yang qi, so how could they, at the tempered body sixth-seventh layers, resist?Not to mention, these were only ordinary strikes that didn\u2019t even utilise the Yang liquid. If he had used the Yang liquid, Kai Yang\u2019s strength would be even more powerful. It was just that over these past few days, he had only condensed one drop of Yang liquid, so how could he bear to use it here?The number of Storm House disciples that were defeated by Kai Yang was no small amount, but he didn\u2019t have an easy time either. Afterall, he was only at the tempered body seventh stage, furthermore, he had yet to cultivate any bodily movement martial skills. How could he possibly avoid all of the attacks rain down upon him by this hoard of people?Dripping down the side of Kai Yang forehead, his blood flooded, this scene was replicated on his arms and legs with bruises appearing all over his body. But not only were these injuries unable to impact Kai Yang\u2019s fighting strength, they actually made him more and more difficult to attack and caused his strikes to become more and more ruthless.From his bones, a warm feeling seeped out, causing Kai Yang to have an endless amount of power. Accompanied by this warm feeling, not only was his strength replenished but it also caused his attacks to become slightly more powerful and also gave him a burst of speed.Kai Yang really didn\u2019t know the mystery behind the golden body, but every time he sustained injuries, every time he got hurt, they would stimulate the golden body\u2019s healing effects. Injuries and pain would thus only make him even stronger.The observing Hu Mei Er was subjected to extraordinary scenes again and again, her small cherry coloured lips had yet to close. Originally she thought that this Sky Tower Pavilion disciple would be speedily dealt with, and then brutally beaten by Cheng Shao Feng\u2019s people. But the current battle results were vastly different from her battle forecast, there were about ten collapsed disciples from Storm House\u2019s side, not to mention first couple who were rendered unconscious by the stone, the rest were all lying on the ground rolling about in pain. Their skin steamed and was fire red in colour.Is this person using World Qi to battle? Hu Mei Er was shocked beyond compare, for those tempered body practitioners to use their World Qi, the more they used it, the less they had; it was far too hard to recover at the tempered body stage. This was equivalent to digging one's grave, wasn\u2019t he afraid that his current actions would impact his future development?p.s. Haha, I was bit too angry over Hu Meir Er. But DMR, the reason why I didn't like her not because of her using her natural assests but because she was acting all cutesy and adorable but in fact she's cruel and calculating. I hate women like that, I have no problem with cute girls but if you fake it, (urgh) then I can't stand them. Also please join me in saying thank you to Suood K.

    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 \u2013 You are such a powerful personPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 40 \u2013 You are such a powerful personThe high tension battle continued with Storm House disciples continually collapsing, but for every disciple that collapsed, Kai Yang gained a new injury. With his constant battling, Kai Yang\u2019s robes had long since been dyed red with blood, gasping out for breath, the veins on his neck protruded out distinctly, with bloodshot eyes his entire being seemed to have turned into one of a bloodthirsty beast.Unbearingly, Su Mu lay on the ground in pain as he stared blankly at Kai Yang\u2019s mind shaking battle; each time he knocked down an enemy another would rise, leaving an inexplicable feeling within Su Mu\u2019s heart. Today\u2019s affair was caused by him, and Kai Yang was also his enemy, yet he had still come to help him avoid certain death.Although he was determined to help, his strength had been exhausted due to beating he had received from Cheng Shao Feng.\u201cPeng!\u201d It sounded out, another Storm House disciple was sent flying to the ground, when he landed he howled in immense pain. The energy produced from the True Yang Tactics had entered his body, causing him feel a scorching heat and painful aching.Kai Yang\u2019s bloodshot eyes glanced over to the stunned Cheng Shao Feng, on his face was a cold and mysterious smile.Cheng Shao Feng\u2019s heart was in turmoil, for Kai Yang\u2019s savagery made him fearful. Now that his gaze was towards him, his entire body was frozen to the ground.Hu Mei Er\u2019s laugh full of scorn sounded out.This laugh made Cheng Shao Feng feel embarrassed, he straightened himself up and looked to Kai Yang coldly. Calmly he said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell that you actually had that much skill.\u201dStep by step, Kai Yang just walked over, his steps steady, his skinny body emitting a crazy torrent of pressure.Cheng Shao Feng\u2019s breathing slowly became ragged, his expression changing he suddenly called out: \u201cYou are courting death, so do not blame me!\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking,he pulled out a sabre from his belt. When he was dealing with Su Mu and the others, he didn\u2019t use his weapon at all because he didn\u2019t want there to be any casualties; the stone was only used because blood had rushed to his head and he wasn\u2019t thinking clearly. But now, if he didn\u2019t have a weapon in hand, Cheng Shao Feng held no confidence.This blood covered Sky Tower Pavilion disciple was extremely fierce.\u201cYou be careful, for this person has already reached the Kai Yuan Stage.\u201d Su Mu begrudgingly informed Kai Yang, albeit unclearly.\u201cKai Yuan Stage\u2026\u2026.\u201d Muttering, Kai Yang stopped in his tracks.Cheng Shao Face became pleased, immediately gaining arrogance, he bellowed out: \u201cBrat, you are only at the tempered body level, so how are you my match? Since you have used such a large amount of your World Qi, you would need at least a few months before being able to recover it all. If you continue to battle, it will affect your foundations and don\u2019t even think about breaking through anymore. Now be a good child and kneel for forgiveness, I\u2026\u2026\u201dds, Kai Yang had already rapidly charged over.\u201cYou\u2026..\u201d Cheng Shao Feng was greatly alarmed, is this person an idiot? He already knew he was at the Kai Yuan Stage, yet he still dared to charge over.Although he was astonished, Cheng Shao Feng didn\u2019t dare to be negligent. Gripping the sabre, he stabbed towards Kai Yang.In response to this direct attack, Kai Yang did something that no one would have imagined; he opened up his palm and motioned to catch it.Although this sabre was only an ordinary ranked weapon, it was still a sharp weapon. How could a corporal human body possibly withstand such a weapon?Cheng Shao Feng\u2019s expression was pleased, thinking that he was walking down the path to his own demise. Increasing the speed of his long sabre, he went to greet Kai Yang\u2019s open palm.\u201cPu\u201d it sounded, it seemed to go exactly how everyone imagined it would go, with the sabre impaling Kai Yang\u2019s hand and blood spurting out everywhere.Hu Mei Er\u2019s was startled, when she had seen Kai Yang\u2019s confidence and how he welcomed it with grandeur and power, she thought he had some unimaginable and amazing method. But now when she saw that he was so easily injured by Cheng Shao Feng, she couldn\u2019t help but feel disappointed.In the end, the person didn\u2019t amount to much, and only had foolishness!Before Hu Mei Er\u2019s thoughts were finished, they changed by one hundred and eighty degrees. Even though Kai Yang\u2019s hand had been pierced, he didn\u2019t stop and still closed in towards Cheng Shao Feng.In a blink of an eye, the two people were within reach of each other while the sound of flesh on the sabre made others cringe.Pa\u2026..it sounded, Kai Yang\u2019s skewered hand went to grip onto Cheng Shao Feng\u2019s sword hand and the handle.With the frenzied Kai Yang in front of him, Cheng Shao Feng could no longer hide his fear. As he tried to pull back his sabre, the opponent held on firmly for dear life.Laughing maliciously, Kai Yang\u2019s pair of bloodshot eyes glinted with a bloodthirsty luster while he threw a bloody fist towards Cheng Shao Feng\u2019s face.Frantically Cheng Shao Feng raised his arm to block while also hastily using his World Qi to assist in his defence.But Cheng Shao Feng had only just entered the Kai Yuan Stage, how much World Qi did he have within him? Ruthlessly, Kai Yang\u2019s fist smashed into his face, dislodging one of his teeth and his cheek immediately started to swell. The scalding that he felt afterwards, was like boiling water was constantly being poured onto his face.Such tyrannical World Qi! Cheng Shao Feng was finally frightened. He discovered that even though he was at the Kai Yuan Stage, the World Qi inside of him, could not block this fiery invasion; in a few moment he was burnt into dizziness.Distracted, Kai Yang\u2019s second fist arrived, causing Cheng Shao Feng\u2019s mind to become unclear.Another fist caused his entire body to become limp, causing him to kneel in front of Kai Yang with his head bent and a dazed expression.Moving his leg back, Kai Yang kicked out and sent him flying away.In the midst of the ensuing silence, Hu Mei Er was shocked beyond belief. It seemed that this person wasn\u2019t foolish, the reason why he went to grab that long sabre was because he had something planned. Only once he caught the sabre, would Cheng Shao be unable to move or properly attack.The dozens of Storm House disciples, even the Kai Yuan Stage Cheng Shao Feng were completely wiped out!Turning his head, Kai Yang looked over to Hu Mei Er. Focusing his blood red eyes on her, Hu Mei Er unconsciously shivered.She had never met such a savage person at only the tempered body stage, after all it was bloody battles that shaped the younger fighters, she had never really experienced such things before,\u201cChi chi\u2026..\u201d The noise of people\u2019s aching teeth rang out, meanwhile Kai Yang just calmly took out the sabre that had pierced his hand, letting a river of warm blood flow out.Throughout the entire process, not even his eyebrows had creased in pain. And after he threw the sabre to the side, he unhurriedly walked over to Hu Mei Er.This flirtaious to the bone girl shuddered on the spot and swallowed panickedly, while forcing out a hollow laugh.As she smiled, Kai Yang had already reached her and had her slender, white neck within his bloody grip.As her feet were lifted off the ground, she let out a muffled cry. From within Hu Mei Er\u2019s throat, came a fiery cry, and a groan that seemed to be lost in her daydreams.Leaning over, Kai Yang looked at Hu Mei Er, all the while laughing coldly.Nervously Hu Mei Er\u2019s heart thumped, and quickly she went attempted to explain: \u201cI\u2019m not together with them, for I am from the Blood Group. I also have not raised my hand against the Sky Tower Pavilion\u2019s people.\u201d\u201cReally.\u201d Kai Yang smiled meaningfully.\u201cEn.\u201d When Hu Mei Er saw that she could still talk with this person, her heart calmed down. Although she was female, she was stronger than Cheng Shao Feng, but she had no real dominance. (like powerful aura)That was because of the physique!\u201cYou are\u2026\u2026..are such a powerful person.\u201d Picking up her courage, Hu Mei Er extended one green, green, white, jade-like hand and placed it on Kai Yang\u2019s stomach. Shortly, a few of drops of blood landed on her hand and she didn\u2019t go to wipe them away. She unexpectedly put her finger in her mouth and sucked on it.In that moment, those ruby red lips appeared thrilling and alluring to touch, her mesmerizing erotic eyes flashed with a mysterious light.p.s. This was a very hmmmm chapter. I mean it was great and questionable, the end was very hmmmmmm. But enjoy it, :D! I'm getting waay to biased too.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 \u2013 Tempered body eighth stagePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 41 \u2013 Tempered body eighth stage\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u2026.are you this powerful in other places too.\u201d Hu Mei Er\u2019s sharp and watery eyes looked at Kai Yang mysteriously, her words explicitly clear.This type of open and brazen enticement, as long as it was a male, then I\u2019m afraid they wouldn\u2019t be able to resist. Not to mention Hu Mei Er, because she was also quite attractive, her figure was not bad. So many people were already thinking about it.A series of sounds came from all directions, the sound of people simultaneously swallowing their saliva. Su Mu\u2019s group of people were already weak in body, now with this type of stimulation, their blood rushed to their heads, their lower parts stuck up, while some fainted on scene.(TL: Blood rushed to my head too\u2026\u2026..T_T, man\u2026\u2026.)Kai Yang also felt a burning sensation rise upwards, his adam\u2019s apple bobbed a bit. His breathing became rough, and his grip on Hu Mei Er\u2019s neck involuntarily increased in strength.Hu Mei Er delicately gasped, her body squirmed a bit before angrily speaking: \u201cWhy do you still not let go?\u201dWhile she said that, she also reached out a tender hand to gently prise open Kai Yang\u2019s hand. It\u2019s unknown whether it was an accident or if it was on purpose, all in all she had moved Kai Yang\u2019s hand and placed it on her plump and well-rounded chest.An astonishing amount of elasticity and warmth passed on through his hand, and Kai Yang clearly felt a defined peak from the palm of his hand. This type of stimulation cause the blood flowing from his wounds to increase a bit.Kai Yang\u2019s face was somewhat red, he had never imagined that his woman would be licentious to this degree. She really was ah, she most definitely possessed some ulterior move with this flirtatious behaviour today.When she saw Kai Yang\u2019s embarrassment, Hu Mei Er unexpectedly started to laugh. Exhaling she said: \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201dAs Kai Yang looked down at Hu Mei Er, he felt like a dog that had bit a hedgehog. Thinking back to the start of the battle, this Hu Mei Er really didn\u2019t attack any of the Sky Tower Pavilion disciples so Kai Yang naturally couldn\u2019t hit her. The only reason he wanted to give this woman a lesson was because she had been constantly fanning the flames during the battle.But because he was this easily toyed with by her, Kai Yang was somewhat annoyed. Kai Yang after all was still a man, how could he be so easily played around with by her?As he thought over it, Kai Yang\u2019s hand that was covering Hu Mei Er\u2019s hand suddenly squeezed tighter. T_T\u201cEn\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Hu Mei Er\u2019s expression changed as she moaned out, looking at that handsome face hers turned red. Angrily she glared at Kai Yang, for she would never have imagined he would harbour such feelings towards females.(TL: Old man Meng\u2019s teachings are coming in)Laughing out loudly, Kai Yang stood up and said to Hu Mei Er: \u201cYou can go.\u201dHu Mei Er stared blankly ahead before looking dazedly at Kai Yang. She would have never expected that her seductions would have almost no effect. Her body, it was unknown how many people wished to have a taste. On ordinary days, there were numerous rivals that she didn\u2019t even pay attention to. But today, when there was finally a male that she held some interest in, when she had tried to seduce him, she was actually disregarded by him.Is he still a man?After standing there for a few moments, she started to laugh. With a multitudinous array of movements, she got up from the ground. Towards Kai Yang, she nibbled her red lips. Walking over to Kai Yang\u2019s side, she gently blew into his ear and whispered: \u201cYou are very interesting!\u201dOnce she finished speaking, she chuckled and turned around to leave not forgetting to use her thousand way swaying of the hips technique.From afar, Su Mu\u2019s lot were watching stupidly, their eyes full of jealousy and envy. They didn\u2019t think that Kai Yang would actually refuse this type of good luck. They were all thinking that if it was them who were in that situation, what would they do?They would have probably pounced! No, no, no they would have definitely pounced. The good luck of meat pastries dropping from the sky, why would they refuse it? In any case, they wouldn\u2019t have lost anything.After Hu Mei Er left, everybody then turned their heads back to Kai Yang, feeling both sad and embarrassed.Ai\u2026\u2026\u2026many sighs rang out.Kai Yang squatted down, and went to rip a few strips of cloth off the bodies of the fainted disciples from Storm House. Then he went to roll the cloth strips around his own hands a few times.Looking at Su Mu\u2019s group, these junior disciples all had faces full of embarrassment.\u201cDo you still have the strength to walk?\u201d Kai Yang asked.They nodded their heads slightly.\u201cThen walk.\u201dThe entire group had bloody noses and swollen faces, as they returned to Sky Tower Pavilion with great difficulty before dispersing to find their own medicines and seek out treatment. Although they had fought a great battle today, it was only a battles between juniors. And the three powers would often have such fights between each other, so there was nothing special about it.Also long as nobody important died, the respective elders of each faction would turn a blind eye and ask no questions. Only through battles, would one improve, and every faction elder wished for this kind of tempering to occur so as to allow for improvement in the strength of their juniors.Kai Yang returned to his little wooden hut, as he had planned to take out that remaining blood clotting cream. But after thinking it over, he discarded the idea.During today\u2019s events, the only serious injury he received was the one on his hand that had been pierced by the long sabre, the rest were nothing really. Although the wound on his hand looked really serious at first, when you looked more carefully, you could see it wasn\u2019t that major. When he went to catch Cheng Shao Feng\u2019s sabre, Kai Yang purposefully avoided allowing it to pierce his bones or meridians. So although there was an extra hole in his palm, it was only a simple flesh wound.It was literally the same type of wound that he had received from that flower patterned spider. It had taken him roughly three-fours days to basically recover, so should be the same this time too.In addition, in just this short amount of time, Kai Yang\u2019s wound had already healed by quite a lot, and his stamina had also recovered by a bit. Without sensing his body condition, he wouldn\u2019t have guessed that the warmth emitted by the golden body also contained healing properties. And that the True Yang Tactics, Yang qi also contained a small amount of healing properties. With the assistance of these two, his injuries recovered quickly.After he learnt that the True Yang Tactic\u2019s Yang qi contained healing properties, Kai Yang quickly drifted over to Coiling Dragon Stream to absorb the Yang qi. Although in the battle today, he didn\u2019t use a single bit of that drop of Yang energy, he had used up quite a bit of his body\u2019s Yang qi. He urgently needed to replenish it.Just as he was absorbing the Yang qi, Kai Yang felt a drumming from within his body. Uncontrollably, the outside Yang qi surged into his body, and within a moment, the amount he had absorbed was equal to one or two days worth at his previous speed. Not only was his Yang qi replenished from today's fight, it was also even richer than before and his meridians and channels had also strengthened and expanded by a fair amount.Tempered body eight stage? Turning his body around, Kai Yang\u2019s face held a happy expression.He had reached the tempered body eight stage in such a short amount of time, it came as no small surprise to him. He had originally estimated that it would take at least another seven to eight days before he would breakthrough.For such a thing to occur, it was clearly related to Kai Yang\u2019s battle today. As expected, battling with others really helped you improve quickly.His heart happy, Kai Yang began to cultivate his True Yang Tactics even more diligently than before. After he had broken through a level, the speed at which he absorbed the Yang qi had clearly increased by a lot and furthermore overall his abilities were strengthened.At nighttime Kai Yang returned to his wooden hut to rest. In the end, he had still received several injuries today, so it wasn\u2019t the right time to pull an all-nighter in order to cultivate.Over the next couple of days, apart from eating and sleeping, Kai Yang spent all his time near Coiling Dragon Stream in order to cultivate.On the other hand, Su Mu\u2019s group, not a single one of them had popped out. It was probably because they were all still nursing their injuries.Early in the morning a few days later, just as Kai Yang was sweeping the grounds, he saw Su Mu leading Li Yun Tian and the others over towards him; all those who had participated in the battle that day, not a single one was missing. They were all valiant and full of vigour following behind Su Mu.Although they had recuperated well over these past few days, their appearances were still a bit miserable, their eyes were bruised, mouths were swollen and overall they appeared very comical.Looking over, Kai Yang couldn\u2019t help but say: \u201cJunior Su, is your skin itching again?\u201d(TLN: This is similar to saying are you itching for a beating again? Lol)p.s. Heyo again! Well this chapter was another hurdle to tl, :P. Really Hu Mei Er starting to remind both Ben and I of a certain lady in TDG with her persistence and usage of her sex appeal. Just read all your comments and whoa, all those about berserk and blood sucking. Unfortunately, as you just read that doesn't happen. Though\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026as a spoiler, here's the next chapter title \u2013 Chapter 42 \u2013 That day\u2026\u2026ke\u2026..you touched right?

Of course, his gaze was somewhat complicated, it contained admiration unwillingness, vexation and relief.\u201cGive me the items.\u201d Su Mu suddenly said while putting his hand out, and Li Yun Tian immediately carried over two wine jugs over and gave them to Su Mu.Leaving one for himself, Su Mu gave one to Kai Yang. Without saying anything, Su Mu went to open the jug and started to drink from it.A group of Sky Tower Pavilion disciples that had walked by were staring in a daze, and looking at Su Mu distractedly. They didn\u2019t know what sly plans Su Mu was up to now, for he was actually drinking wine early in the morning here.Smiling faintly, Kai Yang also went to open the jug up and drank in large mouthfuls.\u201cGood!\u201d Li Yun Tian shouted out loudly from behind Su Mu.\u201cGood!\u201d The others also started to shout.\u201cSou, sou\u201d the two people sounded out and at the same time, both Kai Yang and Su Mu smashed their wine jugs and ended up with wine drenching them.\u201cDrinking in broad daylight, corrupting the Sky Tower\u2019s principles, name your prime offenders. Five contribution points will be deducted from you each. Next it won\u2019t be as lenient as this!\u201d A Dark Hall disciple appeared from the sidelines, as he coldly informed Kai Yang and Su Mu.\u201cDeduct it, deduct it!\u201d Kai Yang was indifferent, but if this was a month earlier he would be bleeding. Now, he was indifferent.Since Kai Yang didn\u2019t care, how could the second generation young master Su Mu possibly care? For he has a very powerful patreon, so contribution points to him were not worth that much.\u201cZhao Hu, help senior brother Kai finish his sweeping.\u201d Su Mu said as he waved his hand at Zhao Hu.\u201cOkay.\u201d Zhao Hu who had been punched senseless previously by Kai Yang hurriedly rushed over and took the broom away from Kai Yang\u2019s hands.\u201cThis isn\u2019t appropriate.\u201d Glancing at the male Dark Hall disciple Kai Yang said before that disciple snorted coldly and walked away.\u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go to your small home for I have some things I need to discuss with you.\u201d Su Mu said.Next to the small hut, Kai Yang and Su Mu squatted in front of the pond while a small group of people bustled around behind them, patching up the holes in the roof.It looked like after the events from that day, Su Mu\u2019s group of people had completely put away their past emnities with Kai Yang. Not only had they put them away, they even wanted to make up for it.\u201cWhy did you come and save us?\u201d After a period of silence, Su Mu finally opened his mouth to ask this question.\u201cWhy\u2026\u2026..\u201d Kai Yang\u2019s eyebrows wrinkled, \u201cYou guys call me senior brother, so naturally I must act like a senior brother. I should think this is the reason.\u201dThough the most important thing was that Su Mu\u2019s inner character wasn\u2019t really that vile.Turning his head, Su Mu went to asked Kai Yang seriously: \u201cReally?\u201dLaughing a bit, Kai Yang replied: \u201cThen why did you think I saved you?\u201dSu Mu became silent, his heart was quite upset and after a while he answered: \u201cSince you regard us as junior brothers, then we will also regard you as our senior brother. In regards to the silly past issues, this junior brother is sorry.\u201d\u201cI never really took it seriously.\u201d Kai Yang replied.Looking in each other's eyes, they started to laugh out loud.Laughing will enable enemies to reconcile and repay one\u2019s debt of gratitude. It probably speaks about these types of things.With their gratitudes and grudges settles, Su Mu no longer felt embarrassed or reserved. He really started to treat Kai Yang as his senior brother. After speaking out some unimportant things, Su Mu suddenly licked his lips and his face became red. He softly asked: \u201cSenior brother, I want to ask you a question.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Kai Yang looked at him oddly.\u201cThat day\u2026\u2026ke\u2026\u2026.you touched right?\u201d Su Mu didn\u2019t dare to look at Kai Yang directly when he asked.\u201cTouched what?\u201d Kai Yang didn\u2019t understand.\u201cIt\u2019s that, ah.\u201d\u201cThat?\u201dSu Mu became depressed, steeling his heart and clenching his teeth he said: \u201cIt\u2019s that Hu Mei Er\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dAs he said this, his heart started to squeeze a bit, moving others.Kai Yang laughed involuntarily, youngsters really were full of vigorous curiosity.\u201cDidn\u2019t you all witness the scene?\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t see clearly\u2026\u2026so did you really touch it?\u201d Su Mu\u2019s mouth was opened really wide.\u201cIf I touched it, what is the matter?\u201d Kai Yang grinned mischievously, \u201cShe voluntarily placed my hand on her. And I merely gave her a lesson only.\u201dGu dong (things falling down), and Su Mu swallowed down a mouthful of saliva. His face full of expectations he asked: \u201cWhat did it feel like?\u201d\u201cJunior brother has never experienced it?\u201d Kai Yang asked in doubt while looking at Su Mu and thinking was this second generation young master still a pure virgin?Su Mu shook his head like a rattle drum, and suspiciously asked: \u201cSenior Brother, you previously have already experienced it?\u201dKai Yang revealed a pondering expression, and then showed an angry but happy reminiscing look. Sighing out: \u201cAi, let\u2019s not talk about past things.\u201dSu Mu looked on blankly, while giving a knowing smile. He couldn\u2019t help but curl up his lips: \u201cYou talk big. Three years ago, senior brother, you came to pay your respects to the Main Gate. And in these three years, you didn\u2019t go and make any friends with others, so how could you have an opportunity. If so, then it would have to be before you entered, Three years ago, how old were you?\u201dThree years ago, twelve years old!Twelve years old, and a beauty felt no shame to actually come at him. If it wasn\u2019t because she was only fifteen, and if it wasn\u2019t because they were both naive and innocent, then something would have really occurred.Thinking about that beauty again, Kai Yang\u2019s heart felt sorrowful. He didn\u2019t know how her life was currently.\u201cAnyway, senior brother, you should be careful. Hu Mei Er is quite arrogant and since you brushed away her face, she definitely won\u2019t let it go.\u201d Su Mu went to remind him.\u201cShe wants to deal with me?\u201d Kai Yang\u2019s expression turned icy.Laughing loudly, Su Mu said mysteriously: \u201cEn, to deal with you in bed. You wait and see. She definitely will use a thousand different techniques to try and seduce you. As long as she doesn\u2019t obtain her goal, she won\u2019t give up. Senior brother, your luck with women isn\u2019t bad or shallow.\u201d\u201cThose types of people I disdain.\u201d Kai Yang didn\u2019t take this issue too seriously, and said to Su Mu: \u201cYou said that you have something to talk to me about, and it\u2019s actually this? (Xia Ning Chang is the only one for me.)\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201d Widening his eyes, Su Mu said: \u201cSenior brother, this time when you were dealing with Cheng Shao and his people, you used up quite a lot of your precious World Qi. I just want to compensate you.\u201d\u201cCompensate me?\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Su Mu nodded his head and then from within his clothes, he took out a bottle and said to Kai Yang: \u201cThis is a bottle of small returning pellets. Senior brother, take these to help you recover and you should be able to recover all of your lost World Qi.\u201dSmall returning pellets, Kai Yang had actually heard of them. Although these types of medicinal pellets effects weren\u2019t that strong, they were very gentle because they were most suited to practitioners like Kai Yang who were around the tempered body seventh stage.From the tempered body seventh stage to the ninth stage, although martial practitioners started to produce World Qi, you could also increase it by cultivating martial skills. But because you couldn\u2019t recover World Qi swiftly until you reached the Kai Yuan Stage, it was considered extremely precious. Once you used it, one must pay a great price to recover it, however with the help of the small returning pellets, one was able to greatly reduce the time needed. To practitioners of the tempered body seventh to ninth stages, this was most suited for them, but they were also quite expensive. Though, for Kai Yuan Stage practitioners and up, it wasn\u2019t the slightest bit useful.It was just Kai Yang\u2019s situation was slightly different other people\u2019s, the True Yang Tactics that he cultivated allowed for one to not worry about World Qi. If the World Qi within him was used up, then there was still the Yang liquid. So this bottle of small returning pellets had little value.Just as he was about to refuse, Su Mu seemed to look through his thoughts and sternly said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to owe others anything.\u201d\u201cFine, then I shall accept it.\u201d Kai Yang didn\u2019t act politely anymore.Smiling, Su Mu said: \u201cSenior brother, wait for me here and I will take you to a good place.\u201d\u201cWhat good place?\u201d Kai Yang asked doubtfully.Su Mu only laughed without answering, telling him to wait and that he definitely wouldn\u2019t be disappointed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 \u2013 The gate\u2019s secretPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 43 \u2013 The gate\u2019s secretInside Black Wind Forest, there was a line of Sky Tower disciples walking into the depths.Kai Yang would never have thought that the good place that Su Mu wanted to take him too was actually located in the Black Wind Mountains. Walking in the forest, Kai Yang saw a distinct path. In this type of dense forest, if humans did not frequent it, then a clear path would not appear.Do a lot of people come and go in the Black Wind Mountains? Pondering over it, it seemed that it was true for in the distance there were some faint figures advancing in a similar fashion to his group.\u201cSenior brother, do you know why that day we met up with Cheng Shao Feng and his people near Black Wind Forest?\u201d Walking in front of Kai Yang, Su Mu went to ask Kai Yang.Kai Yang\u2019s expression changed, while he had a faint idea: \u201cCould it be that Cheng Shao Feng and them also wanted to come to Black Wind Forest?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. We the Sky Tower Pavilion, Storm House and Blood Group aren\u2019t that far away from each other. The distance from Black Wind Forest to each of the three places is about the same, so if any disciples from these factions want to enter here, they would need to pass by the four-way intersection.\u201d\u201cWhat type of people attracting place is here? Otherwise, why would you all come over here?\u201d\u201cHe he.\u201d Su Mu laughed out proudly: \u201cSenior brother, now this you may not know. Inside Black Wind Forest, there is an underground market. We disciples from the three factions and even martial practitioners from all of the Black Plum Village area come over here. Disciples are able to exchange useless data and skills that they don\u2019t need for more useful things or for gold and silver. This Black Wind Trade area is bustling, so senior brother should definitely come here and look.\u201dLi Yun Tian added: \u201cThat\u2019s right, senior brother. You can often find some good things over here. Last time young master Su used twenty or so sliver to obtain some Tianyuan Fruit.\u201d\u201cTianyuan Fruit?\u201d Kai Yang\u2019s expression changed.\u201cEn, earth grade lower level spirit fruit. The seller didn\u2019t recognise what he was selling, allowing me to benefit greatly.\u201d Talking about that matter, Su Mu became proud.Earth grade lower level spirit fruit, if you wanted to convert it to a monetary value, it would be valued at around two thousand silvers at the least. It was actually brought by Sui Mu for a mere twenty silver coins, isn\u2019t this a great deal.That Black Wind Trade area, Kai Yang really didn\u2019t hear about it before at all, in the entirety of the time that he had been in Sky Tower. Since he hadn\u2019t socialised with a single person, they naturally wouldn\u2019t tell him such news.It looked like Su Mu\u2019s group often came over here to browse, and each one was fairly familiar with the layout. From their conversation, Kai Yang heard many interesting things, and he started to have some anticipation for this place. \u3002Since he cultivated the True Yang Tactics, then he would be able to find some Yang attributed elixirs for him to use, but it was just that he didn\u2019t have a lot of money on hand. Then he remembered that small bottle of small returning pellets, Kai Yang gained some confidence.Black Wind Trade was a fair distance away, so the group of people chatted to each other while walking over.Kai Yang suddenly asked: \u201cJunior brother Su, does our Sky Tower Pavilion have an eleventh elder?\u201dHe had remembered that old man he had met beside the Coiling Dragon Stream and that old man was a complete mystery. It caused others to be unable to forget him.\u201cEleventh elder?\u201d Su Mu was stunned, \u201cWhen did Sky Tower Pavilion suddenly have an eleventh elder?\u201d\u201cEh, I just wanted to ask .\u201d Kai Yang understood now. That time when the old man had said he was some eleventh elder, he was already suspicious. Now it looked like his status was truly a lie, it was just that old man was calm and friendly. Since he held no malice or evil intentions to him, Kai Yang didn\u2019t want to investigate further and risk provoking his disgust.Li Yun Tian laughed out: \u201cSenior brother Kai, since you are always cultivating, naturally you wouldn\u2019t know too much about our Sky Tower Pavilion affairs. We only have five elders, there really isn\u2019t some eleventh elder.\u201dThis group of people all knew about Kai Yang\u2019s previous tragic history of being bullied, so out of the goodness of their hearts, they went to inform him of the various things happening in Sky Tower to prevent him from asking another awkward question in the future.An elder was Su Mu\u2019s backer, so his understanding of Sky Tower affairs was better than anyone else's. So as they were talking, they drifted to the topic of Sky Tower Pavilion\u2019s Head.Lowering his voice, Su Mu said: \u201cListening to my old devil speak, I heard him say that our Head is a peak existence. Nowadays, it is said that he has reached the peak of the Shen You Boundary and is just a step away from breaking through to the next stage. Within a thousand mile radius, he is the number one expert.\u201dPeak of the Shen You Boundary! Kai Yang was shocked in amazement.For a martial practitioner\u2019s grade started from the tempered body level, followed by the Kai Yuan Stage, Qi Dong Stage, Li He Boundary, Zhen Yuan Boundary, Shen You Boundary and each level was then divided into a further nine ranks. As your strength increased, it became harder to breakthrough. You couldn\u2019t see many Shen Boundary level experts, and one would never have imagined that the Sky Tower Head had actually reached the Shen You level. If he were to breakthrough, then he would become a true peak expert.\u201cThat Blood Group Head, Hu Man, and the Storm House Head, Xiao Ruo, were only around the Shen You Boundary sixth or seventh stages and are incomparable to our Head.\u201d As Su Mu said this, his face showed a proud expression. Afterall, a school head\u2019s strength is also a source of pride for the schools disciples.\u201cHow much longer will our head need to breakthrough?\u201d Li Yun Tian enthusiastically asked. If the head were to suddenly breakthrough, then in a thousand mile radius, Sky Tower Pavilion would become the leading faction. Who would dare to come provoke them then?Su Mu\u2019s face darkened and he slowly shook his head.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Seeing Su Mu like that, Li Yun Tian asked worriedly.\u201cThe old devil said, that it has already been ten or so years since the head reached the Shen You peak.\u201d\u201cThen why hasn\u2019t he broken through up until now?\u201d Everybody asked.Ten years, even if cultivating was difficult, you should be able to breakthrough.Su Mu continued to shake his head: \u201cI don\u2019t dare say.\u201d\u201cYoung master Su, how could you do this. Invoking our curiosities but refusing to talk further. Isn\u2019t this equivalent to taking most of a beauty's clothes off but not all? This is too brutal.\u201d Zhou Hu complained relentlessly, and the rest all joined in enthusiastically encouraging Su Mu.\u201cOkay then, but you must all remember you mustn\u2019t tell anyone else or there will be great troubles.\u201d Su Mu said with grandeur, then looking around he lowered his voice and said: \u201cTen years ago, our Sky Tower had a big situation. It was because of this, that our head\u2019s cultivation has yet to rise.\u201d\u201cWhat situation?\u201d Everybody asked while swallowing.\u201cOur head has no wife nor children, so he accepted two disciples and the situation originated from these two disciples. Of these two disciples, the elder disciple was hardworking while the younger disciple was intelligent. Both were shocking geniuses, and the head used all of his heart to teach them without the slightest bit of reservation. These two were also hardworking, their strengths were neck and neck and no one was worse than the other. It was just because these two people\u2019s nature\u2019s were different, so the head\u2019s teaching style was different for each one; the older disciple received greater amounts of praise, while the younger disciple was treated harsher and the head was stricter with him. Due to this, the younger disciple gradually drifted further away from his senior brother and also became more and more frustrated. So he went to find a forbidden and sinister technique to cultivate.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..\u201d Everyone cried out in fear.Su Mu continued to speak and captured everyone\u2019s attention again.You couldn\u2019t tell, but Su Mu was born with an eloquent tongue. The way he narrated, made the story flow very well and he succinctly expressed how the grudges between these two fellow disciples had started to his audience.Kai Yang only listened in silence, and didn\u2019t interrupt for he thought that this affair was most likely true, but Su Mu would have also added some extra details to exaggerate the situation.p.s. Hi~ How are your days so far? Thanks for always coming to read my translations and enjoy this chapter. What did you think about the little backstory on the ST Head? Somehow it was a bit typical but still interesting, but when I saw that big chunk of backtsory I had to tl, my face turned white. When I finished, I saw long it was and shook my head.

    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 \u2013 Su YanPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 44 \u2013 Su Yan\u201cAfter he learnt this skill, the second disciple\u2019s temperament changed completely and his strength also suddenly increased by a large amount. The older disciple unexpectedly was no longer his opponent. With his new found strength, the second disciple thought that the Head would praise him more, but the fact that he had cultivated a sinister skill was finally discovered by the Head. But this discovery caused the second disciple, to be fully engulfed and fall into the darkness. That night ten years ago, rivers of blood flowed within Sky Tower Pavilion! The elder disciple died tragically that night, and the second disciple escaped from his punishment.\u201dSpeaking up to that point, Su Mu paused for a moment, and swivelled his head around to see everyone holding their breath in rapt attention with their ears attentive. Highly satisfied he continued: \u201cIn one night, the head lowered his head is depression. The two disciples he was most proud of, one had died and the other had succumbed to the dark ways; the impact that it had on him, well as you can imagine it was very great.\u201d\u201cFrom that moment onwards, the head went into seclusion and few people were even able to see a trace of him. Most people thought that he had become broken and passed away, but they would have never imagined that a few years later he would come out again even stronger than before to go and personally capture his second disciple and seal him in Coiling Dragon Stream! \u201dKai Yang\u2019s heart suddenly shook as he remembered that mysterious eleventh elder\u2019s last words.\u201cI did not come here for treasure, I am here to meet someone!\u201dMeet who? There was no doubt in Kai Yang\u2019s mind it was the person sealed in Coiling Dragon Stream.Could it be that this eleventh elder was\u2026\u2026\u2026Su Mu continued to speak: \u201cBut because of these events, the head was unable to breakthrough the Shen You Boundary and could only stop at this stage. If this knot is not untied, then he will be unable to advance any further in this life.\u201dWith the story finished, everyone released large sighs as they could breathe once more. They felt pity for the Sky Tower Head\u2019s predicament, while also scolding that ungrateful second disciple who had fallen to sinister and forbidden ways.Kai Yang\u2019s mood was also in disarray, in the end was the eleventh elder him? If what Su Mu had said was true, then there was a high chance that, that old man was who he suspected him to be.Just at that moment, the bustling and noise from up ahead transmitted over. Kai Yang lifted up his head to look and saw that there was a large clearing in this dense forest. And in that clearing was a buzz of voices, like a great marketplace. The three school\u2019s disciples were all gathered here with big and small stalls all lined up with their glittering wares, with all types of products on display. It was a feast for the eyes.There were also ten or so wooden houses on the perimeter, with the construction being somewhat simple. There were large ones and smaller ones; the smaller ones were probably for living in, while the larger ones were for people to shelter from the rain as they could house a large amount of people.Because it was currently very sunny, the disciples from the three factions had set up their booths outside under the sun.Black Wind Trade was like a completely different world of in and of itself.\u201cWell then, we have arrived.\u201d Su Mu\u2019s main goal this time was to bring Kai Yang over here, ensuring that he knew there were these type of places present here. So if there were things he needed in the future, he could come over here to trade for them.\u201cThis place isn\u2019t bad.\u201d Looking at the bustling crowd doing trade in the clearing, his face revealed his excitement.Laughing, Su Mu said: \u201cOf course, for this place has the things that we low levelled martial practitioners need. Furthermore, you don\u2019t need to worry about safety, for each of the three factions have some of their experts stationed here to oversee and maintain public order. Do you see that small wooden house, that is the home of our Sky Tower overseer and my older sister is in there.\u201d\u201cYour older sister?\u201d Kai Yang looked towards him, and remembered how last time Su Mu had come looking for trouble and said that his older sister was a core disciple. Core disciples, they were the future hope of Sky Tower.Su Mu suddenly became alert: \u201cI will warn you first, don\u2019t have any ideas with my sister.\u201dKai Yang couldn\u2019t help but laugh.Su Mu said again: \u201cBut even if you did have an interest in her, I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t have the ability to reach her.\u201d\u201cYou older sister is very powerful?\u201d\u201cOf course. Zhen Yuan Boundary third layer, not many of the younger generation are qualified to become her opponents.\u201dKai Yang was slightly moved, for a younger generation disciple to cultivate to the Zhen You Boundary was already too rare. For the next stage was the Shen You Boundary, in other words the stage at which the head was currently at.\u201cSince your older sister is that talented, why are you only at the tempered body stage?\u201d Kai Yang asked Su Mu, puzzled.Like he was being repeatedly poked in a sore spot, Su Mu\u2019s immediately became embarrassed. After being at a loss for a while he replied: \u201cIt\u2019s not good, but don\u2019t worry for I will work harder to cultivate. Afterall, I can\u2019t allow you, a trial disciple to surpass me.\u201dNodding his head a bit, for it seemed that the previous few days sufferings at Kai Yang\u2019s hands had ignited Su Mu\u2019s competitive spirit.\u201cLet\u2019s go, I\u2019ll first take you to meet my older sister. With her protection, then in this Black Wind Trade, it will be easier to do what we need to do.\u201dSince they said they were going to meet Su Mu\u2019s elder sister, everybody's expression immediately became serious. Even Su Mu himself went to tidy up his clothes, and brush all of the dust from his clothes.You could see clearly that Su Mu was really afraid of his sister or even worshipped her.\u201cWhat is Su Mu\u2019s older sister called?\u201d Kai Yang asked Li Yun Tian in a low voice.\u201cSu Yan!\u201dHer name wasn\u2019t bad, he just didn\u2019t know what type of person she was.Soon they had arrived at a wooden house, Kai Yang went to observe the house and the surrounding wooden houses and saw that each of them had hung a plaque saying Sky Tower Pavilion. It looked like these few houses were the residences of high levelled Sky Tower members.Su Mu was a bit nervous and lightly breathed a few breaths before cautiously walking up the steps. Then he elegantly lifted up his hand and lightly tapped the door a couple of times and then spoke out in a strange kitten-like voice: \u201cElder sister, I have come to visit you.\u201dWhile Li Yun Tian and the others used all their might to suppress their laughter, their shoulders started shaking. Kai Yang also couldn\u2019t help but laugh.Su Mu knew the reactions of the people behind him and really wanted to turn around and glare at them.\u201cEnter!\u201d A light and cold voice sounded out from inside. It was like a clear mountain spring, new to their ears.Su Mu beckoned to the others and them walked inside.Once they entered, Kai Yang secretly looked around and saw that this house was even more simple than his own wooden hut. There was nothing inside, but once they entered the outside noise was unexpectedly filtered out, causing the house to become peaceful.This wooden house should have some sort of secret, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t have this type of effect.Just as he was observing the house, Su Mu suddenly let out a blood-curdling screech. Kai Yang swivelled his eyes over and saw Su Mu crouched on the floor covering his head. Not far away in front of him was a woman dressed in snow white clothes with a frosty expression.This woman had luscious and beautiful black hair, crescent shaped eyebrows, a pair of bright and slender eyes, a small and cute nose, with peach pink cheeks, a pair of delicate cherry lips and glistening pale jade-like skin accompanied by a dainty, graceful and slender physique; indescribably enchanting.It was just her temperament was exceptionally icy-cold and even made the room\u2019s overall temperature plummet.Currently, that woman was sitting cross legged looking at Su Mu. Without saying anything, you knew this was Su Yan.\u201cDo you know why you were hit?\u201d Su Yan asked.Su Mu shook his head and saw a monious glint in his sister\u2019s eyes, and quickly nodded his head.\u201cThen say it.\u201d Su Yan\u2019s voice was extremely light, will carrying something which didn't allow one to rebel against. Kai Yang guessed the reason why Su Mu was so afraid of his sister now. Who ever got such a sister, no one would be able to bear, even though she was a great beauty.p.s. So hey there again. Double release today because it is a sponsored chapter by the novels nao team. Well we all expected Su Yan to be a beauty didn't we? My day was quite good, played a bit of lol in the afternoon. Though towards the evening I had a headache, D; but after eating dinner it got better and I could finish this chapter! Thanks for asking 123isme and OhDine.

As he answered, he also secretly went to measure up Su Yan.The latter\u2019s face was still unempathetic: \u201cWhy did you get beaten by them?\u201d\u201cMy skill wasn\u2019t up to par\u2026\u2026\u201d Su Mu lowered his head a bit more.\u201cWhy wasn\u2019t your skill enough?\u201d Su Yan continued to question, in order to get to the root of the problem.Su Mu could only honestly answer her: \u201cI didn\u2019t practise diligently enough.\u201dSu Yan nodded her head lightly: \u201cYou still have a bit of intelligence! Then you know what to do in the future?\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cRemember your words today, so if later in the future you want to go and play around then it will not be someone else who will beat you, instead I will do it personally.\u201dSu Mu\u2019s face paled as he repeatedly swore he would diligently practise and cultivate so as to meet his elder sister\u2019s expectations.After she finished lecturing Su Mu, Su Yan finally lifted up her head to look at the people behind him. Sweeping across them, her gaze landed on Kai Yang and a trace of astonishment flashed across her eyes. She asked: \u201cIt\u2019s you who defeated Cheng Shao Feng?\u201dKai Yang thought that this senior sister\u2019s information network was quite fast. Although she trained here, she was still able to receive information regarding matters occurring outside in a timely fashion. He nodded his head: \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a bit better than Su Mu.\u201d Su Yan was indifferent, and Kai Yang looked like he wasn\u2019t that old, about fifteen-sixteen. He was only at the tempered body eighth stage, his natural talent shouldn\u2019t be that good, so he was naturally unworthy in her eyes. The only reason why she spoke to Kai Yang was because he had saved Su Mu.\u201cI\u2019ll give you a word of advice.\u201d\u201cPlease say it senior sister.\u201d Kai Yang\u2019s expression remained impassive.\u201cStay away from Su Mu, if you continued to stay close to him, then your cultivation will stop and stagnate around this level.\u201dKai Yang smiled slightly, but didn\u2019t bother to reply. She could belittle Su Mu, but Kai Yang couldn\u2019t.Su Mu was smiling but his face fell quickly when he heard this, but even he didn\u2019t dare say anything.\u201cLeave now, I want to train.\u201d As soon as Su Yan finished speaking, she closed her eyes.The group of people quietly exited and closed the door behind them. Looking at each other, they all simultaneously let out a breath of relief. The pressure inside was all too great, and although she was a beauty and as such pleasing to the eye, if they had stayed any longer inside, then they felt that both their bodies and hearts would be frozen.\u201cI\u2019m going to look at the refined pills that everyone was talking a couple of days ago.\u201d Li Yun Tian announced before taking his leave.\u201cI\u2019ll also go.\u201d A couple of people called out immediately.Not long after, everyone had dispersed, each going to do their own business leaving Su Mu and Kai Yang behind.Kai Yang saw that Su Mu looked like he had some things to do so he said: \u201cJunior brother, you look like you have some things to do, so go complete them. I\u2019ll just go around and browse.\u201dSu Mu nodded his head as he spoke: \u201cOkay, and if you find anything you like, tell me and I\u2019ll keep a look out for you. Although the majority of people here are not bad, they are still treacherous people and love to trick and swindle others.\u201dAfter he separated from Su Mu, Kia Yang leisurely strolled around the Black Wind Trade area.Here, disciples from the three schools were causally situated everywhere, with their booths set up to present the things which they wanted to sell or putting up signs saying what they wanted to purchase.Each booth was different, each stall resident was calling out in a loud voice much making it appear similar to a busy food market, full of warmth and enthusiasm with everyone busily promoting their wares. Some were arrogant, portraying an if you want to buy then buy attitude, some were acting indifferent in a bid to attract customers, some appeared bored and were cultivating unafraid that others would steal their goods. There were numerous styles of attracting customers, each strong in their own way.After walking around, Kai Yang found out that it wasn\u2019t just buying and selling, there were also some booths which were for the making of immortality pills to aid in cultivation, a service they did without charging a single penny.He thought that they were doing something akin to a good deed, but in reality they were just using others in order to perfect and refine their techniques. That was because these receptariers didn\u2019t have enough experience, eight out of ten pills they made were bad, so their booth fronts were deserted.However, this type of stall wasn\u2019t common at all, after all receptarier masters were few and far between.Kai Yang was paying careful attention to Yang attributed products, before he even entered the trade area, the Origin of Yang in his chest had started to react wildly, showing that there were numerous Yang attributed treasures.But after his little stroll, the things which he came across, their ranks were all rather low. The yang type herbs he saw couldn\u2019t even match up to the yang qi emitted by the Coiling Dragon Stream, so he naturally wouldn\u2019t pay any attention to them.He had found a couple of things that interested him, but after he asked about the price, he could only shake his head and sigh. Those prices were far too high and not something his current self could afford.(TL:you should ask ur buddy ling dong for some money advice, not chu feng tho. he\u2019s a true beast when it comes to spending money. I pretty sure he has already spent like a couple trillion dollars. ED: All stolen money though, so it doesn\u2019t really count. TL: Still, it\u2019s still $$$)After walking around for about another half hour, he was finally clear about the true price of the small returning pellets.Since the small returning pellets were only applicable to those at the tempered body seventh to ninth stages, this type of immortality pill was only worth around fifty two taels.The bottle that Su Mu gave him held ten of these pills, so all up they were worth about five hundred taels.Five hundred taels, it really wasn\u2019t enough to do anything with.In the middle of one booth, there was a fiery coloured stone from which Kai Yang could feel a blistering amount of yang qi and he couldn\u2019t determine exactly how many times more dense the yang qi it emitted was compared to the yang qi from the Coiling Dragon Stream. Kai Yang was certain that if he absorb the energy within that stone, then he would be able to condense at least two-three drops of yang liquid. This was equivalent to many days of hard cultivation if he relied on just the yang qi from Coiling Dragon Stream.Even though he knew this, this booth owner was not easy to get along with and would certainly not sell it at a low price, Kai Yang was unwilling to give up and squatted down.The booth owner\u2019s cold face looked like someone owed him money, he only took one glance at Kai Yang and then proceeded to ignore him.Kai Yang picked up some other things feigning great interest and asked for their prices. The owner, with gold glinting in his eyes, casually said some prices and Kai Yang then inadvertently asked the price of the that red stone. \u201cHow much is this?\u201dThe booth owner laughed out loud, and said a couple more words: \u201cThat is this booth\u2019s most expensive item, three thousand taels.\u201dKai Yang was completely out of ideas, for this was a truly sky-high price. This was far and away from Kai Yang\u2019s upper limit, so how was he supposed to haggle for it?Just as he put it down and prepared to leave, Kai Yang\u2019s shoulder was tapped by someone. He turned his head around and saw a cute and lovable smile directed towards him.\u201cIt really is you.\u201d Hu Mei Er said somewhat unexpectedly.\u201cYou need something?\u201d Kai Yang\u2019s eyebrows creased, and to tell the truth, he didn\u2019t have a good impression towards this morally loose woman. Although she was currently dressed properly, but her wanton actions that day had already left a bad impression in Kai Yang\u2019s mind.Sensing Kai Yang\u2019s indifference, Hu Mei Er\u2019s eyes displayed her displeasure and she cutely declared: \u201cNothing, I only came over to greet you. That\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cEn, good bye!\u201d Kai Yang softly replied before turning around to leave.(TL: Kai Yang, you da man! Thumbs up!)\u201cHey\u2026\u2026\u201d Hu Mei Er called out as she closely followed behind him,.. Whether it was unintentional or intentional, her body stuck closely to Kai Yang and as she walked, she also went to observe Kai Yang\u2019s reaction.After walking around for the time it talks to burn an incense stick, Kai Yang became a bit gloomy. He didn\u2019t know what to do about this woman\u2019s flirtatious behaviour, her skin was really thick. For he already clearly showed that he was not interested in her, yet she still persisted and stuck close to him.\u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d asked Kai Yang as he stopped in his steps, clearly unhappy.\u201cI\u2019m not following you, for in Black Wind Trade, I am only strolling around leisurely. What, do you care for me?\u201d Hu Mei Er smiled adorably, nonstop.\u201cDon\u2019t follow me any longer, be careful or I won\u2019t be polite to you anymore.\u201d Kai Yang said angrily.Not only was Hu Mei Er unafraid, on the contrary, she looked eager to try his patience: \u201cHow will you not be polite? Will it be like last time?\u201dp.s. Okay, what was with that goddamn ending?! DMR, do you still think is she smart? I call that plain shameless now, -_-. I mean even her name means enchantress/charmer. I get a headache from that girl, Ben can't even remember her name, *shakes head*. Anyway, just a heads up, since it's my holidays, my sleep pattern will be very irregular so posting times may be all over the place. Regarding the martial rank names, I was lazy and only put the pinyin up. I will go back and name them in English so don't worry. As for the currency change, silvers \u2013> taels, the author hasn't put any sort of conversions like 10 silvers = 1 gold, so I will use this more now. It's less confusing and makes sense, until they put up some other than one monetary value it will be taels. Good night, for I shall go to sleep now. ^p.s.s. Haha, thanks for the complement Zero, and you all other readers. I'm happy that you enjoy the chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 \u2013 Bringing one to a place without people\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 46 \u2013 Bringing one to a place without people\u2026\u2026.In response to this woman\u2019s troublesome behaviour, Kai Yang didn\u2019t have any good methods to deal with her. He could only ignore her, Hu Mei Er could see Kai Yang\u2019s indifference. Although she dared to provoke him further she chose not to, rather she only wanted to follow him around.Following the pull of his origin of yang, after walking a short while, Kai Yang stopped in front of a booth.Looking over it, Kai Yang\u2019s eyes brightened. The items presented at this booth were quite good, with a majority satisfying his needs.Those pieces of infant fist sized round rocks, dispersed rich and blistering hot yang qi, even stronger than that other booth\u2019s stone. They were just a bit small.Their prices won\u2019t be as expensive as that other stone right? Kai Yang hesitated, while the booth owner warmly welcomed him: \u201cLittle brother, what are you thinking about? My items are good and cheap, as you walk past, you mustn\u2019t miss this opportunity. It doesn\u2019t matter if you are buying for your own use or to sell them later for a profit, all transactions will be fair.\u201dSummoning up the courage, Kai Yang asked: \u201cThese stones, how much are they?\u201dThe store owner lowered his head to look and replied: \u201cYou\u2019re talking about the Bright Yang Stone. They\u2019re not expensive, only five hundred taels for one!\u201dKai Yang\u2019s expression darkened, although he knew that this price was just, he still shook his head and said: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit expensive.\u201dFrom head to toe, he only had about five hundred taels, his entire fortune.The booth owner shook his head as he smiled: \u201cLittle brother, you are telling some good jokes, for the items here are clearly labelled and definitely aren\u2019t an open lion\u2019s mouth. If you go to other booths, and observe their prices, then you will know how worthwhile my price are.\u201dThis sentence was correct, Kai Yang\u2019s journey here, although he didn\u2019t buy anything, he had inquired a lot about the prices. This person\u2019s prices weren\u2019t really that high, but if you wanted to buy something, you needed to bargain.Helpless, Kai Yang could only start a war of words with this booth owner, and make the opponent lower the price. But the owner firmly shook his head, until in the end the owner became very gloomy. With no alternative, he said: \u201cLittle brother, these items of mine, don\u2019t belong to me. I am only helping someone else sell them, as for the price, I can only increase it, not decrease it or I\u2019ll have to make up for the losses myself. Please don\u2019t make things difficult for me anymore. \u201d\u201cHelping someone?\u201d Staring blankly, Kai Yang turned around to the standing Hu Mei Er.In the surrounding area, there was only one faction, the Blood Group!Hu Mei Er sweetly said: \u201cYes, this is my family\u2019s booth. You want these stones?\u201dKai Yang nodded his head.\u201cIf you promise to abide by one of my conditions, I will give you these ten or so stones!\u201d Hu Mei Er\u2019s eyes rotated.\u201cMis\u2026\u2026..\u201d That booth owner\u2019s face changed greatly, if this stock of items were to be lost from his hands, then his future troubles would be great.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will tell my father.\u201d Hu Mei Er assured him. Just as that owner was about to speak, he shut his mouth.\u201cHow about it? You only need to promise me one thing.\u201d Hu Mei Er smiled radiantly: \u201cFor you men, it is a very simple task.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t even think about!\u201d Kai Yang resolutely refused. Even if he used his toe to think, he would be able to figure out what Hu Mei Er meant.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d Hu Mei Er was fuming while she glared at Kai Yang, her expression was one that made it almost look like she had the desire to eat someone.When you actually think about it, her interest in Kai Yang wasn\u2019t that big. It was just that day, when her attempts at seducing failed, it had made Hu Mei Er gloomy, not only this, she also ate a small loss!There is no man that can escape her enticement! Hu Mei Er was convinced of this, that was why she wanted Kai Yang to surrender to her. When the time comes and he surrenders, she would leave him and watch how much of a joke it will be.If Hu Mei Er wanted a man, a single beckoning from her finger would lure a whole pile of them over. If it was for another goal, why would she feel wronged? She is flirtatious and wanton in her behaviour, but that was only an image, an appearance to confuse others.I don\u2019t believe that I can\u2019t conquer you! Hu Mei Er\u2019s heart resolute.Her eyeballs rotating, Hu Mei Er said to that booth owner: \u201cSell it to him at a cheaper price!\u201dThe booth owner scowled miserably: \u201cThat isn\u2019t good!\u201d\u201cI said sell it to him at a cheaper price!\u201d Hu Mei Er lightly clenched her teeth, her charming eyes emitting a bit of frostiness.Just as the booth owner was about to nod his head, Kai Yang waved his hands and said: \u201cNo need, leave at five hundred taels.\u201dSell it at five hundred taels, he wouldn\u2019t make a profit, but he also wouldn\u2019t suffer a loss, it was the set market price.As he spoke, he also went to take out that bottle of small returning pellets: \u201cCan I exchange it using these pills?\u201dThis trade also had it\u2019s own set of rules regarding this, complete immortal pills are also valid currency to exchange for products.\u201cYou can.\u201d The booth owner nodded his head.\u201cThis bottle of small returning pellets contains ten of such pills, so it\u2019s about five hundred taels, you can count it.\u201d Kai Yang then went to throw that bottle over to him, then from the booth he picked one Bright Yang Stone.As he held the stone in his hand, a surge of powerful yang energy came out. His heart satisfied, Kai Yang knew that the transaction was worthwhile.Hu Mei Er regretted it so much she started gnashing her teeth. Kai Yang\u2019s actions were clearly showing that he didn\u2019t want to owe her any debts, meaning that her goodwill went down the drain.The booth owner observed their actions, he was afraid that his no good young lady was having ideas regarding Kai Yang. Although the transaction was just, he knew that his young lady was a bit upset. Thinking for a moment, the booth owner picked up a seed from his booth and said: \u201cLittle brother, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll give you this seed, since I can\u2019t sell it for much anyway.\u201d\u201cWhat type of seed?\u201d Kai Yang took it, and unexpectedly felt some yang qi from within that seed, though it was a bit weak.\u201cIt\u2019s the seed of the Three Sun\u2019s Fruit. We found it when we were mining for the Bright Yang Stones.\u201d The booth owner told him, \u201cThis fruit tree\u2019s fruit is a earth grade lower level spirit fruit. It\u2019s just the growth period is a bit long.\u201dKai Yang laughed involuntarily, thinking what will he do with a single seed? If you planted it, you would need to wait at least ten years for it bear it fruit, but it was someone\u2019s goodwill, so Kai Yang couldn\u2019t refuse. In any case, this seed\u2019s value wasn\u2019t very high, so even if he accepted it, it wasn\u2019t a big deal.(TL: Make it a super OP Spirit Fruit with ur OPOP Black Book Kai Yang! :D)\u201cThanks.\u201d Standing up, Kai Yang put both the Bright Yang Stone and the seed within his clothes.His only bottle of small returning pellets was already gone, and Kai Yang didn\u2019t feel like staying here anymore. But he couldn\u2019t locate Su Mu or his group after another stroll around, so Kai Yang walked out of Black Wind Forest alone.From behind, Hu Mei Er continued to follow him, sticking to him like a tail, however her expression displayed a hint of annoyance.He must think of a way to lose her, otherwise if she followed him back to Sky Tower, he worried how others will view him. This woman\u2019s reputation wasn\u2019t that good.As he looked around, Kai Yang suddenly thought of a good idea, and started to walk into the depths of Black Wind Forest. As he walked, he constantly turned back to Hu Mei Er to hehe laugh at her. It goes without saying it conveyed, \u2018if you dare to follow me over, I will first rape you then kill you.\u2019 A sinister type of feeling was emitted with each glance.Hu Mei Er laughed out, however she was actually a bit terrified and as she saw Kai Yang walk into the depths of Black Wind Forest, she hesitated for a bit. Thinking about it, she wasn\u2019t that familiar with Kai Yang, if she really went in and something something happened, what would she be able to do? That day, she had personally witnessed Kai Yang\u2019s strength, and knew she wasn\u2019t his opponent. If he was just a bit brutal, then she would have scars all over her body.Hesitating for a good while, Hu Mei Er suddenly stamped her foot and while swaying her hips, she followed after him. She was eighty percent certain that Kai Yang was only trying to scare her.Seeing Hu Mei Er really follow after him, Kai Yang became really angry. The reason why he acted in such a way, was to scare away Hu Mei Er. He didn\u2019t expect that this woman\u2019s courage wasn\u2019t small, turning his plans to dust. This moment of anger, caused his heart and mind to twist while thinking, just wait until we arrive at an area devoid of people area, then I\u2019ll show you my might.Tempered Body Stage \u2192 Tempered Body Stage \ud83d\ude1bKai Yuan Stage \u2192 Initial Element StageQi Dong Stage \u2192 Qi Transforming StageLi He Boundary \u2192 Separation and Reunion BoundaryZhen Yuan Boundary \u2192 True Element BoundaryShen You Boundary \u2192 Immortal Ascension Boundaryp.s. As per requested, above is the list of re-named martial ranks names. That last one though, nearly killed Ben and I as we tried to find a suitable translation that didn't sound too weird. Originally the two words together mean \"going on a journey\", but none of the ones we came up with made sense. So I separated the two words and decided to look at it one at a time, and finally decided that this \"journey\" would be like an ascension to become an immortal. As for whether they really become immortal or not, we have to read on! The previous name will be left the same, but we will use the new names from now on. I've also given up on Hu Mei Er, I don;t get how this girl thinks and will no longer try.p.s.s.

    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47 \u2013 You think I\u2019m Dirty?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 47 \u2013 You think I\u2019m Dirty?As Kai Yang and Hu Mei Er\u2019s figures, one in front , one behind, walked into Black Wind Forest, two figures stepped out from behind some trees.One of the people wore a mask of extreme hatred as he looked at Kai Yang\u2019s receding figure, there was also a light purple colour on his charming face. At one glance, you could tell that he had suffered a beating in these last couple of days.While the other person\u2019s expression was truly malicious, staring at Hu Mei Er\u2019s swaying hips, a lustful glint flashed through his eyes.\u201cJunior brother Cheng, you were beaten by those types of people?\u201d The cold and strict face of that youth looked over at Cheng Shao Feng, \u201cAlthough you have just entered into the initial element stage and as such are somewhat weak you aren\u2019t weak enough to not be his match. That guy looks like he\u2019s only in the tempered body stage.\u201dCheng Shao Feng began to defend himself: \u201cI was a bit careless then, and that guy is really strange, for when he started to fight, he disregarded his life completely. As I thrust my sabre out, he actually used his palm to block it and as the sabre pierced through his hand, he didn\u2019t even cry out. Not only did he stop my sabre, he also immobilised one of my arms, and it was because of this that I lost.\u201d\u201cOh? This is a bit interesting, only if we were to compete, who would be the fiercer one.\u201dCheng Shao Feng followed him laughing: \u201cOf course it\u2019s senior brother Nu Tao who\u2019s stronger, how can he compare to you.\u201d\u201cHave you fully investigated his status yet? We can\u2019t provoke or anger any powerful people.\u201d Nu Tao asked him carefully.\u201cI have investigated clearly. This guy in Sky Tower is only a trial disciple with no background whatsoever. Even if you killed someone like this, no one would care. \u201d\u201cHa ha, trial disciple? According to my knowledge, Sky Tower only has about ten trial disciples right? He\u2019s one of those?\u201d Nu Tao kept on laughing like he had heard some extremely good news, for as soon as he heard the two words, trial disciple, all his worries flew away. These people were Sky Tower\u2019s disgrace, for him to lay a hand on one or even eliminate one would be him doing Sky Tower Pavilion a favour.\u201cEn. Before I was afraid that people would come here , so I couldn\u2019t carelessly attack. Who would have thought that this guy would unexpectedly go into the depths of Black Wind Forest with that slut. This makes things much easier.\u201dNu Tao laughed incomparably obscenely: \u201cIt looks like not only can junior brother obtain his revenge, he also has some luck with women. This is really killing two birds with one stone.\u201dCheng Shao Feng also started to laugh: \u201cSenior brother, saying those types of words, you are a helper I have called over. So if there are good things, how can this junior brother enjoy them alone? Later, once senior brother has had his fun, then junior brother will partake. Hu Mei Er that ** although she is loose in her morals,she is young, and her body will definitely be fine.\u201d(TL: OKAY, SOMEONE COME AND KILL THESE **** TARDS!!!)\u201cJunior brother is indeed generous!\u201d Nu Tao was a bit impatient to get started and said: \u201cLet\u2019s go, there\u2019s no time to lose. Let\u2019s quickly catch up to them, and find a good opportunity to strike.\u201dTo these two people, killing Kai Yang was a simple task. While in broad daylight with the sky as their bed, together they could ** Hu Mei Er, this was the thing they looked forward to the most.As for when the time came, whether or not Hu Mei Er retaliated, they didn\u2019t need to consider it. This ** person, as long as they made her feel pleasure, she would happily want more, so how would she dare to retaliate? In most likelihood, she would only immerse herself in that feeling of forceful and insulting pleasure and stop thinking about anything else.These two people were not novices and often spent their time away in Black Plum Village\u2019s red light district. Naturally they would know how to satisfy women like Hu Mei Er.Deep in Black Wind Forest, Kai Yang still was walking and turning around to coldly laugh, Hu Mei Er was still a bit apprehensive. But after seeing Kai Yang repeatedly acting like this, she was no longer scared, not only was she no longer afraid, she had matched Kai Yang\u2019s pace. Intimately she pulled on Kai Yang\u2019s arm and covered his arm with her full and soft chest.Kai Yang became distracted, but when he remembered this woman\u2019s style, his aroused feelings immediately dissipated.\u201cWhat trouble do you want to cause?\u201d Kai Yang was annoyed.\u201cAccompany me once! In the future, I will no longer bother you!\u201d In all four directions, there was no sign of any humans, and Hu Mei Er didn\u2019t bother to mask the intent behind her words in the slightest. She even dared to say these shameful things!\u201cGo and dream!\u201d\u201cAm I not beautiful?\u201d Hu Mei Er\u2019s charming eyes were like silk, \u201cIs my figure not good? Are you not even the slightest bit moved?\u201d\u201cA woman is defined by her outside and inside traits. Your outside isn\u2019t bad, and your are justified in being proud of it, but your inside is unbearable to look at.\u201d Kai Yang looked at her coldly.These words were a bit heavy, Hu Mei Er asked, her face down: \u201cYou think I\u2019m dirty?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Kai Yang replied straightforwardly.Hu Mei Er\u2019s charming face trembled, and she sneered: \u201cYou are nothing but a trial disciple in Sky Tower. Although my strength isn\u2019t as high as yours, I am the Blood Group Head\u2019s daughter. The fact that I can take a fancy to you is your good fortune, and yet you unexpectedly can\u2019t see your own good fortune when it\u2019s in front of you! Do you know how many men are outside having ideas about me?\u201d(TL: Yeah, at least two despicable ones.)\u201cThen, your royal highness can go find those men. Why is there any need to nag me?\u201d Kai Yang indifferently replied.\u201cKai Yang, don\u2019t be shameless when other\u2019s are giving you face! If I return and inform my father that I was humiliated here, even if you are a Sky Tower disciple, you still wouldn\u2019t be able to see tomorrow\u2019s sun.\u201d Hu Mei Er hissed out as cutely as possible. Kai Yang\u2019s attitude, had completely infuriated her, making her face hit rock bottom. After all, her status wasn\u2019t low, how could she have suffered this type of humiliation before?Kai Yang also coldly laughed: \u201cI dare to ask your royal highness, if I were to kill you right here right now, will you have the opportunity to return and complain?\u201dHu Mei Er looked distracted, her rage had made her forget that she was deep in Black Wind Forest, and if Kai Yang really attacked her, she definitely would have no hope of returning alive. Also this was the ideal place to murder someone. In other words, if she really died here, she would have died in vain.When she thought about this, Hu Mei Er became alert, looking at Kai Yang she urgently retreated a few steps. A trill in her voice, she said: \u201cYou\u2019re joking right?\u201d\u201cThere is a limit to my patience.\u201d Kai Yang indifferently replied.Hu Mei Er rigidly looked at him, her eyes containing her humiliation and fury, but she didn\u2019t dare do anything. She wasn\u2019t sure whether Kai Yang\u2019s words were a joke or not.While Hu Mei Er was in confusion, Kai Yang suddenly became vigilant and looked over in a certain direction.Intentionally or not, Kai Yang moved in front of Hu Mei Er. Looking at a large tree he said: \u201cCome out!\u201dHu Mei Er was surprised, but the next moment she understood what was going on.Two people suddenly came out from behind the tree, and walked over while smilingly coldly. Their laughs were sinisters and strange, one looked at Kai Yang without rest and the other at Hu Mei Er.(TL: Reveal! Ah, Cheng Shao Feng fancies Kai Yang!)\u201cCheng Shao Feng, Nu Tao?\u201d Hu Mei Er clearly recognised them, and cried out their names in suspicion, but in a blink of an eye, she knew the reason why these two people showed themselves here.This time, it looked like Kai Yang was in some real danger.Being stared at unrestrainedly by Nu Tao\u2019s obscene gaze, caused Hu Mei Er\u2019s entire body to feel uncomfortable, and she creased her eyebrows, she moved to further hide behind Kai Yang\u2019s body.\u201cElder sister Mei Er, come over here. We only want that guy\u2019s life, move to the side, so you don\u2019t accidently get injured!\u201d Cheng Shao Feng called out from about five to ten feet in front of Kai Yang, as he warned her he slowly drew the sabre hanging at his side.Nu Tao also spoke up, laughing he said: \u201cThat\u2019s right, if you were to get injured, my heart would ache.\u201dp.s.

    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 \u2013 Prominent PowerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 48 \u2013 Prominent PowerCheng Shao Feng and Nu Tao had already stated their purpose in coming here, causing Kai Yang to be startled. He never thought that these two people would be so ruthless and heartless; they actually wanted to kill him over a single dispute.As he vigilantly watched the pair, Hu Mei Er secretly whispered in Kai Yang\u2019s ear: \u201cKai Yang, if you don\u2019t want to die, then obey my words. Half a month ago, that Nu Tao advanced to the initial element fifth stage, and is not comparable to Cheng Shao Feng. Not to mention there are two people, you definitely aren\u2019t their match.\u201d\u201cYou have a method to deal with them?\u201d Kai Yang asked unconvinced.\u201cI can\u2019t deal with them, but they definitely won\u2019t have the guts to kill me. As long as you agree to my condition, I can promise you that you won\u2019t die.\u201dHu Mei Er\u2019s status was clearly displayed, so if she really wanted to protect Kai Yang, Cheng Shao Feng and Nu Tao wouldn\u2019t be able to ignore her and not give her face thus at most they would beat up Kai Yang to vent their anger.\u201cNo need.\u201d Kai Yang slowly shook his head.\u201cYou are that unwilling, to the point you would rather die?\u201d Hu Mei Er looked at Kai Yang like she was looking at a retard, disbelief in her eyes.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say, I am slightly mysophobic. What\u2019s more, who will die or live will only be determined once fists are exchanged.\u201d Kai Yang calmly looked over the two people opposite him.Receiving this answer, Hu Mei Er\u2019s face changed irregularly. After a while, she sneered out coldly, biting down with her ivory teeth, bitterly saying: \u201cSince you\u2019ve chosen this way, then follow it through to the end!\u201dAfter this was said, she retreated about ten feet back and crossed her arms to watch.Cheng Shao Feng laughed out loudly: \u201cElder sister Hu Er is really obedient. I just knew that elder sister Hu Er wouldn\u2019t cause us any inconvenience.\u201dHu Mei Er squeezed out an extremely ugly face, and no one knew what she was thinking in her heart.Nu Tao he he strangely laughed, and sized up Kai Yang from head to toe. Nu Tao cracked his knuckles and slowly shook his head: \u201cYou are called Kai Yang right? When you reach the netherworld you must not blame me, for you should blame yourself for meddling in others\u2019 business. Would you like to end it yourself, or shall I do it for you?\u201dThis question was extremely savage, but Kai Yang just smiled: \u201cIf you want my life, then use your ability to come and take it!\u201dAs he said this, he secretly started to activate the True Yang Tactics.Just as the True Yang Tactics were about to activate, Kai Yang already felt a violent feeling from his chest as well as blistering hot energy getting sucked in via his acupuncture points. Within this blistering hot energy was large amounts of Yang qi. In that moment, Kai Yang\u2019s meridians were painfully hot, it was so hot smoke started to emit from his chest, roasting the skin until it turned black.Kai Yang was greatly alarmed, and before he could respond, his meridians which were experiencing searing pain adapted and the large amount of Yang qi continued flowing into his meridians.It took literally the blink of an eye, his meridians became packed to the brim with Yang World Qi, swelling non-stop.Drip drip\u2026\u2026.it was like movement from the depths of his soul, and within his dantian there unexpectedly was one more Yang Liquid drop.A short while later, another drip sound was heard.In the span of three breaths, two drops of Yang Liquid were formed. Just what was the matter with that third drop, for as soon as it condensed, it disappeared.Only after that moment did the violent surge of Yang qi stop.Bright Yang Stone! Thinking about it, Kai Yang took out that Bright Yang Stone which had cost him the bottle of small returning pellets. But how could this stone, which was previously filled to the brim with Yang energy manage to retain its former glory? Inside, not even a trickle of energy remained; it had actually been fully absorbed by him in that short period of time.In the end, it only condensed two drops of Yang Liquid! It was only that one of these drops had disappeared, confusing Kai Yang. Including the original drop within his dantian, there were only two drops.This absorption rate\u2026\u2026isn\u2019t it a bit too fast? It was basically force feeding, not even allowing him to have any reaction.Kai Yang\u2019s transformation was seen by Cheng Shao Feng and Nu Tao. Kai Yang\u2019s change within his chest area caused them to become at a bit of a loss, but with Nu Tao\u2019s battle experience, he immediately waved his hand and said: \u201cJunior brother Cheng, follow me and advance. I\u2019m afraid things have changed.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d The earlier Kai Yang died the better was how Cheng Shao Feng felt. With no hesitation, he carried his long sabre and rushed forward, his face a cruel mask.Two people, side by side, they were like a storm and in the blink of an eye, they arrived in front of Kai Yang.Nu Tao\u2019s strength really was higher by a level, so his speed was also faster. His fist flew forward covered in World Qi, suddenly charging straight for Kai Yang\u2019s faceInitial element fifth stage, they would have already amassed quite a decent amount of World Qi, a martial practitioner\u2019s battle prowess could not be underestimated.The fist that Nu Tao threw out caused a faint whistling sound, clearly displaying the fact that he was using some sort of martial skill.Kai Yang didn\u2019t dodge and also threw out a fist.\u201cPeng\u201d it sounded out and Kai Yang\u2019s wrist bone rang from the impact, while his fist felt like it was cut up by hundreds of razors. In a second, numerous cuts appeared, and he couldn\u2019t help but retreat a few steps.Though Nu Tao cried out oddly, for he felt that he had struck a blazing hot piece of iron. His skin and flesh were all burned painfully and he screamed out: \u201cSuch hot World Qi!\u201dWith his initial element fifth stage strength, he was unable to defend against a martial practitioner who was at the tempered body stage\u2019s attack. This was really a bit strange.When these two people traded fists, each one had retreated a few steps.Holding his sabre, Cheng Shao Feng joined the fray, his desire for vengeance raging, as he thrust towards Kai Yang, determined to cut him down then and there.After experiencing Nu Tao\u2019s attack, all of Kai Yang\u2019s blood had started to boil and from his bones, a warm feeling started to seep out; it felt like he had an inexhaustible supply of power. As his eyes slowly turned red, his original gentle looking face became malevolent and berzerk.Facing Cheng Shao Feng\u2019s sabre, Kai Yang used one hand to catch it.Cheng Shao Feng sneered: \u201cI have already learnt from last time. Do you really think that this young master would really trip over in the same place twice?\u201dAs he said this, he swept his sabre to cut off Kai Yang\u2019s fingers. Kai Yang\u2019s reaction wasn\u2019t slow. Sensing that the opponent\u2019s blade was changing directions he changed his hand into a grabbing hold.\u201cPu\u201d, the long sabre still managed to chop off one of Kai Yang\u2019s fingers, causing Cheng Shao Feng\u2019s face to blossom in elation. Hu Mei Er covered her mouth, extremely disturbed, but when she remembered Kai Yang\u2019s attitude to her, she thought that he should be hacked into pieces.\u201cHow could this be?\u201d Cheng Shao Feng cried out in fear, for he realised that he hadn\u2019t actually severed Kai Yang\u2019s fingers. Although it wasn\u2019t a immortal weapon it was still a sharp weapon, could a tempered body stage martial practitioner\u2019s body be this strong? Even if it were someone at the initial element stage, their fingers would be severed.Kai Yang laughed maliciously, revealing his row of eerily white teeth and looked at him with his blood coloured eyes. Cheng Shao Feng was feeling somewhat panicky now, so while he hurriedly retreated, he also shouted out loudly: \u201cSenior brother Nu, save me!\u201dBefore the words had left his mouth, Kai Yang had already pursued him and a drop of Yang Liquid within his dantian started to move through his will, into his fingertips.Pointing out, he went straight for the middle of Cheng Shao Feng\u2019s head.Cheng Shao Feng opened his mouth widely and ceased to breathe, falling to the ground. On his forehead there was a hole about the size of a chopstick penetrating through his skull. The hole was very smooth and slick, in fact not even a drop of blood flowed out. Eyes wide open, his dying expression was one without any trace of his previous grievance.\u201cAh!\u201d Two cries of alarm simultaneously rang out. They originated from Nu Tao and Hu Mei Er who had witnessed the startling scene.p.s. So your first regular release of the week!

    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 \u2013 VictoryPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 49 \u2013 VictoryCheng Shao Feng died! With no warning, he died just like that under Kai Yang\u2019s hand.Last time when Kai Yang had fought with the Storm House disciples, Hu Mei Er had watched from start to finish. So although she knew that Kai Yang\u2019s power was great, she hadn\u2019t thought that he would be as strong as this just a few days after the previous fight after !Initial element first stage Cheng Shao Feng, he had only faced Kai Yang for a few moments and died from a single poke to the head!What martial skill was that? How could there be such a powerful martial skill? The hole in Cheng Shao Feng\u2019s forehead alluded to the fact the skill utilised a strong yang attributed qi in some manner to burn through the skull.At this point, Hu Mei Er\u2019s heart was in a state of panic, for when she learned of Kai Yang\u2019s thunder-like murder methods, she finally knew that Kai Yang\u2019s previous words were no joke.He really dared to kill others, whilst also having the ability to do so!Nu Tao was also very shocked, for he had just exchanged one fist with Kai Yang and before he could commence his second attack, his junior brother had died in front of him. This unforeseen accident really made him flabbergasted.\u201cYou actually killed junior brother Cheng!\u201d Nu Tao shrieked, \u201cWhat method did you use!\u201d(TL: Well you did threaten to kill him. I vote self-defence.\u270b)That single finger\u2019s power was far too tyrannical, it was definitely some extremely rare martial skill. Nu Tao was a bit afraid, afraid that even he would unable to resist that technique.\u201cYou also need to die!\u201d Kai Yang knew that to destroy the branch, he must destroy the root. The reason why these two people followed him here was because they wanted to kill him. To this these types of enemies, how could Kai Yang possibly lenient.The circumstances now were different to before, last time it was a group fight, so Kai Yang\u2019s hand would naturally be more lenient. But currently, these two people wanted his life, to these enemies he mustn't be merciful, otherwise he was just asking to die later.Seeing Kai Yang hurriedly charge over, Nu Tao suddenly laughed out maliciously: \u201cDon\u2019t bluff, come and get it!\u201dAs he shouted, he threw out two fists to greet Kai Yang. The opponent was only at the tempered body stage, so how much World Qi could they possibly store inside them? The martial attack just then was extremely powerful, so it should have used quite a lot of his World Qi. In other words, he couldn\u2019t possibly use that type of method again.That\u2019s why Nu Tao had nothing to fear!When those fists collided, Nu Tao knew that he had made a mistake. This Kai Yang could still use his World Qi, and every time they collided, he could feel a blistering hot energy seeping out from Kai Yang\u2019s fist. This energy caused Nu Tao to shrivel up, although he was at a higher stage of cultivation than Kai Yang, he was unable to suppress him.Nu Tao came up with many countermeasures, jumping from left to right, he didn\u2019t dare confront Kai Yang straight up. He only wanted to prolong the fight until Kai Yang used up all of his World Qi, and at that moment, it would be like Kai Yang was a fish on a chopping board.Nu Tao\u2019s tactics and thoughts weren\u2019t wrong, to deal with ordinary tempered body stage disciples this method was the most effective, allowing one to suffer the least in return for taking down the opponent. But Kai Yang was different, for he had just fully absorbed all of the Bright Yang Stone\u2019s Yang qi and his meridians were brimming with energy. If things really continued, it would possibly be Nu Tao who ran out of strength first.Very soon, the fight became unfavourable for Nu Tao.At the beginning, Kai Yang truly acted like a typical martial practitioner at the tempered body stage. Regardless of his fists, or power, although they were stronger than a typical tempered body stage practitioner, the strength he displayed didn\u2019t go past that of a tempered body stage practitioner. But as time went on, as various types of wounds started to appear on his body, Kai Yang\u2019s strength started to climb up bit by bit. Each fist was faster than the last, his strength also grew stronger and stronger, but the most fearsome aspect wasn\u2019t either of these, but rather that the blistering hot energy his fists released was growing stronger and more abundant.It appeared that as the fight drew on Kai Yang\u2019s strength rapidly grew in relation to the passing of time and the injuries he sustained.What was going on? When a martial practitioner battled, as time went on and the more World Qi they used, a martial practitioner would only become weaker and weaker. How could it possibly be the complete opposite?In the time to took to drink a cup of tea, it became harder and harder for Nu Tao to dodge and escape Kai Yang\u2019s attacks. With one failed dodge, he was punched in the stomach by Kai Yang.This fist caused Nu Tao to be unable to breathe, and the fiery energy that invaded his body was also quite ferocious as it wrecked havoc.Looking at the blood red eyed Kai Yang, Nu Tao began to consider retreat!With a feint move, Nu Tao retreated and sped far away, and while he gasped for breath he howled out: \u201cKai Yang, since you have killed junior brother Cheng, you are doomed!\u201dInitial element fifth stage, even if they couldn\u2019t defeat the enemy, if they wanted to escape, their opponent couldn\u2019t do anything. And of this, Nu Tao was highly confident, because in the previous battle he had discovered that Kai Yang didn\u2019t cultivate any bodily martial skill.If Nu Tao wanted to run, Kai Yang couldn\u2019t block him and could only helplessly watched as he ran away. But suddenly Kai Yang thought of an idea, and the last drop of Yang Liquid within his dantian winked out and zoomed to his fingertips.Shortly after Kai Yang reached out with his other hand and pulled on his fingers and a sensational scene appeared.This drop of Yang Liquid, in the blink of an eye morphed into a blood red blade as thin as cicada wing. Just as the blade was formed, under Kai Yang\u2019s urgings, it flew out.\u201cSou\u201d it sounded, a graceful red colour pierced the air and embedded itself into Nu Tao\u2019s back.Nu Tao\u2019s running figure immediately became rigid, and with a pu tong, he fell to the ground.The silence of the forest was broken by a songbird\u2019s cry, meanwhile Kai Yang gasped for breath, his whole body battered and exhausted.Hu Mui Er\u2019s pair of legs trembled, her entire body ice-cold, even her heart was cold. She had never left, waiting for the moment when Kai Yang couldn\u2019t take it anymore and had to ask for her help and then she would be able to achieve her own goal.But no matter what, she would have never imagined that those two Storm House disciples who had come to kill Kai Yang, would be killed by Kai Yang instead.These two people were both at the initial element stage, one at the first stage and the other at the fifth stage. Together they battled against a tempered body stage practitioner, Kai Yang, and in the end not only did they lose, they also paid with their lives.All of this seemed too unreal, too mind baffling.Suddenly, Hu Mei Er\u2019s face became startled. She saw Kai Yang turn his head over to face her with an expression that looked like he wanted to eat her. Within his eyes, glinted a deep and murderous light.Hu Mei Er unconsciously retreated a few steps.\u201cIf you dare move, then die!\u201d Kai Yang\u2019s icy-cold voice travelled over.\u201cI won\u2019t move\u2026\u2026\u201d Within Hu Mei Er\u2019s voice was sounds of sobbing, a warm wet patch appeared on her lower abdomen, in that moment she had forgotten all her manners.She really was scared, and she wasn\u2019t certain whether or not Kai Yang really wanted to kill her. In life or death, what could she, a young lady do?Kai Yang no longer paid her any attention, but went to Cheng Shao Feng and Nu Tao\u2019s side to take their possessions. In a moment, Kai Yang had found some taels and two bottles of immortality pills.Two bottles of immortality pills couldn\u2019t be considered a lot, but they were still worth something.It wasn\u2019t a loss! It was just a shame, for he had been forced to expend those hard earned drops of Yang Liquid, leaving his dantian empty. After this great battle, the Yang World Qi within his meridians had been consumed to such a degree that just a bit less than half remained.\u201cAre you short of money?\u201d As Hu Mei Er saw Kai Yang looting the two corpses, she mustered up her courage to speak out. \u201cI can give you money, as long as you don\u2019t kill me.\u201dLooking at Hu Mei Er who still dared to flirt, is she showing off her beauty? Even when she spoke, it was cautiously and carefully.Kai Yang enthusiastically looked at her: \u201cIt\u2019s not like I am a bandit, what will I do with your money? If I lack money, I will earn it myself!\u201dp.s. I really enjoyed all your comments and strike zone. AHAHAHA, Uncl-Brother Zero you are too funny. Rogue, your welcome for the TL comments, \ud83d\ude00 and Horos, how did you enjoy my link, ;). Man you readers come up with the best comments. Did you enjoy the chapter? Did you? Kai Yang is slowly becoming OP, but a shame on his Yang drops. Now I will try to start on the sponsored chapters. It may or may not be a double release today!

    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 \u2013 Disposing the corpsePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 50 \u2013 Disposing the corpseHu Mei Er didn\u2019t dare to continue speaking, too many words may result in losses, afraid to offend Kai Yang.\u201cYou come over here!\u201d Kai Yang suddenly beckoned her over, Hu Mei Er delicately trembled, her tears threatening to spill. Tightly she bit her lip, begging Kai Yang with all her heart and didn\u2019t dare to move a single step.\u201cWhat are you afraid of? I told you to come over, so come over!\u201d Kai Yang called out impatiently.Helpless and left without a choice, Hu Mei Er could only walk to Kai Yang. Slowly she walked over to him, and stopped when she was around five steps away from him, looking at him alarmingly.Sensing her fear, Kai Yang found it ridiculous, but he still kept his face the same: \u201cBe obedient and I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201dHis indifferent tone carried an overbearing feeling.Hu Mei Er used all her strength to nod her head: \u201cI will listen.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Only then was Kai Yang satisfied. Bending down, he carried Nu Tao\u2019s corpse over his shoulder and looked over to Cheng Shao Feng\u2019s body: \u201cYou, bring him!\u201dAlthough she felt nauseous, Hu Mei Er didn\u2019t dare disobey his order. Kneeling down as if she was wronged, she went to pick up Cheng Shao Feng\u2019s corpse. Although she was a female, she was after all a martial practitioner and carrying one hundred jin or so wasn\u2019t really a burden.(TLN: Jin is about half a kilogram [0.5 kg])\u201cFollow me.\u201d Looking in a certain direction, Kai Yang went to walk deeper into Black Wind Forest.Hu Mei Er didn\u2019t know what he wanted do nor did she dare to ask and thus she could only blindly follow him.Kai Yang wanted to dispose of the corpses. This place was already quite desolate, but he didn\u2019t know which cheating couple might have a bit of courage and rendezvous with another here.The causes of death for Cheng Shao Feng and Nu Tao were very special, they were both killed by a boiling hot energy that had directly pierced through their vitals. If Storm House investigated their deaths utilising this information as a basis, perhaps it might lead them to him.So Kai Yang must throw the corpses far away, making sure that Storm House\u2019s people would never find them.Two people, one in front and the other behind, walked deeper in the forest. Hu Mei Er hesitated many times, but in the end decided not to speak out.After a while, a lake suddenly appeared in front of them. Kai Yang\u2019s eyes shined and he decided it shall be here.Kai Yang signalled to Hu Mei Er to put down the corpses, and Kai Yang went to search for two big stones. When he returned, he tied these stones to Cheng Shao Feng and Nu Tao\u2019s corpses and threw them into the lake.Brushing his hands, Kai Yang muttered for a while: \u201cYou can now be considered my accomplice, and you should know how to act right?\u201dFinished, he turned around to look at her dismissively.With that said, Hu Mei Er was not surprised and repeatedly nodded her head: \u201cI know.\u201dThe fact that Kai Yang could say these words meant that he had no evil intentions regarding her, guaranteeing her life. Hu Mei Er\u2019s heart and mind relaxed and she involuntarily gasped.\u201cSmart. Smart young girls will always be liked by others.\u201d Kai Yang laughed out lightly.Now that he thought about it, Kai Yang really didn\u2019t know how to deal with Hu Mei Er because if he didn\u2019t kill her, she would always be a dangerous element. Today\u2019s events were all witnessed by her, however if he killed her, he just wasn\u2019t able to do it. From start to finish, Hu Mei Er did not injure him at all, she only stood to the side and watched. It couldn\u2019t be because of this, he had to kill her? That was a bit too unreasonable.After walking for such a long time, Kai Yang had thought it through. This entire affair was completely spurred on by Cheng Shao Feng and Nu Tao and if he didn\u2019t kill them, then he would be just sitting and waiting for his own death. So even if Hu Mei Er spread news regarding this event, Kai Yang wasn\u2019t the least bit afraid.\u201cHave you killed a lot of people?\u201d Hu Mei Er was much more courageous now she thought her life was safe.Kai Yang shook his head: \u201cIt\u2019s my first time killing someone.\u201d\u201cBut I saw that your strikes were very experienced, and when you killed them, you didn\u2019t even crease your brows. It did not look like it was your first time.\u201d Hu Mei Er said, unconvinced.With that said, Kai Yang wrinkled his forehead. That was true, it was his first time killing someone, why wasn\u2019t he the least bit afraid? Although he didn\u2019t feel any excitement, he definitely felt no fear. Back then, he was only focused on the battle, and his brain only thought about killing them, now when he thought about it, it was all a bit inconceivable.\u201cWhether or not you believe me is up to you.\u201d Kai Yang didn\u2019t bother explaining any further.Circling around the lake, he walked to the place furthest away from the location he had dropped the corpses. There, Kai Yang stopped in his steps and dived head first into the lake.During the course of this battle, Kai Yang had received no small amount of wounds, he needed to at least wash himself clean before returning.Hu Mei Er stood at the lakeside waiting, while thinking about going in too. If it was before, she would definitely have gone in to provoke Kai Yang, but now she didn\u2019t have the guts.Waiting until he finished his bath and came back up, Hu Mei Er finally spoke: \u201cWait for me a bit, I also want to go wash.\u201d Having carried that dead body for such a long journey, Hu Mei Er felt uncomfortable all over.Women would always love cleanliness.\u201cOkay.\u201d Kai Yang replied while wringing dry his clothes, before going to lie on a stone to bask under the sun and recover his strength.Not daring to undress, Hu Mei Er directly dove into the lake and her body, as graceful as a fish in water, was completely visible. From time to time, she would secretly look back to see if Kai Yang was looking at her, but he didn\u2019t even have ** to look at her. This was a great blow to Hu Mei Er.He wasn\u2019t the least bit moved?After a good half an hour, Hu Mei Er had finally washed herself clean and came ashore.** clothes stuck closely to her body, her exquisite and alluring figure was fully revealed. Forthrightly, she walked over to Kai Yang\u2019s side with her cheeks bright red and sat down to bask in the sun with him.Kai Yang opened his eyes to look at her, his gaze sweeping all over her, Hu Mei Er kept her head lowered.\u201cFigure is really good.\u201d Kai Yang mumbled, nodding his head.Hu Mei Er nibbled her dark red lips, her expression incomprehensible: \u201cActually\u2026..I haven\u2019t really done those types of things with a man, to the point that the only men that has touched my body\u2026\u2026is you alone. These past few years, the only reason why I act like I do is one, to help the group recruit a couple more talented people and two to strain the relationship between the Sky Tower and Storm House disciples. To nag had also become one of my motives.\u201dHearing this, Kai Yang stared blankly at her before looking deeply at her.\u201cYou don\u2019t believe?\u201d Hu Mei Er\u2019s cheeks were very red, this secret she had never told anyone before. Outside people truly thought she playing away each night, exhausting men. On the outside, calling her princess, my lady, but behind her back they called her slut, **.\u201cI believe!\u201d Kai Yang nodded his head, \u201cBut how is this related to me?\u201dHu Mei Er\u2019s face darkened as she forced a smile: \u201cIn the future, I will no longer come to pester you.\u201dThis afternoon\u2019s event, the impact it had on her was a bit too big.Hearing her say this, Kai Yang couldn\u2019t help but feel his heart relax, for he had finally gotten rid of this inconvenience.Waiting until Hu Mei Er\u2019s clothes had dried, only then did the two leave the lakeside.To avoid other\u2019s eyes and ears, Kai Yang and Hu Mei Er parted ways early on, each returning their own sect.After he returned to his wooden hut, he rested for a while before going to Coiling Dragon Stream. This great battle had exhausted his hard earned Yang Liquid. Naturally he must quickly replenish his Yang World Qi, otherwise when he experiences this type of situations again, he would have no way to deal with it.Not only did he consume two drops, the power roused Kai Yang\u2019s determination greatly, for he would never have imagined that the Yang Liquid\u2019s might would be so formidable. He was only at the tempered body eight stage, if his cultivation was higher, wouldn\u2019t the Yang Liquid\u2019s might be even more powerful? No matter the reason, Kai Yang was itching to begin his training again.p.s. Turns out today ended up being another double release, a treat for you readers and we have reached chapter 50! But who would have expected Hu Mei Er to just confess like that? Oh do you want the name of the next chapter? Huh? It's calllllllleeeeeedddddddd Chapter 51 -xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.

    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 - The seed\u2019s mutationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 51 \u2013 The seed\u2019s mutationArriving at Coiling Dragon Stream, Kai Yang sat down and prepared to start his training but suddenly thought of something.Hands searching his pockets, after feeling around for a long time, from his chest he took out a seed. This seed was the one given to him when he had brought the Bright Yang Stone from the Blood Group booth\u2019s owner.It was said to be some earth grade lower level Three Sun\u2019s Fruit\u2019s seed.Kai Yang wanted to plant it, even though he didn\u2019t know how many years it would take for it to bear fruit, it wouldn\u2019t take much energy. Also, there were abundant amounts of Yang Qi in the surrounding area which undoubtedly made it the most suitable place to plant this fruit.But just as he took out the seed, Kai Yang felt there was something wrong.Earlier in the day when he saw this seed, he didn\u2019t see or sense any abnormalities within it. It only had a faint, almost imperceptible, trace of Yang qi within it.But currently, the seed had become bright red and translucent, like a red gemstone. Holding it in his hand, Kai Yang could feel the seedling emitting a steady pulse.It was like\u2026\u2026..It was like a human\u2019s beating heart, surging with vitality.Not to mention that the seed currently held a much larger amount of Yang qi when compared to earlier.He was in a daze for a good while before waking up from that stupor! He had finally realised where that third drop of Yang Liquid from within his dantian had disappeared off to.Clearly it had been absorbed by this seed! If this was not the case, how could this ordinary seed possibly undergo a one hundred and eighty degree change in just a few hours? One drop of Yang Liquid, if there were no outside influences helping, it would take Kai Yang several days of hard work to condense.Kai Yang nearly went to reabsorb the Yang Qi within that seed!Despite thinking about it, Kai Yang didn\u2019t do it. This seed had clearly undergone a huge change, so if he went to plant it, what type of fruit would it bear?A youngster\u2019s curiosity and thirst for ** knowledge was incomparable. It was just like the curiosity Kai Yang held regarding the changes a precious drop of Yang Liquid would have on the seed.Carefully considering it, Kai Yang started to move and first went to find a patch of relatively soft earth. Carefully, he dug a hole to put the seed inside and then went to find some water to water it.After this task as completed, Kai Yang then sat down to activate his True Yang Tactics.He doesn\u2019t yet know whether or not this drop of Yang Liquid he has invested in the tree will be worthwhile.The night passed by, after training all night he could clearly feel that his absorption speed had become faster again. Thanks to training all night, the Yang Qi within his meridians was replenished.By his estimation, it would take another two-three days before he could condense another drop of Yang Liquid. Compared to the time it took to condense his drop, his cultivation was far more efficient now.The morning of the second day, Kai Yang practised the tempered body record for half an hour.The tempered body record\u2019s training, he had never skipped a single day of it. The only thing that he needed to do every day, apart from sweeping the grounds, was practising the tempered body piece, he would also go find a junior disciple to bully a bit to earn some contribution points while the rest of his time was spent non-stop training.Half an hour later, Kai Yang stopped his work! By accident he walked to the place where he had planted that Three Sun\u2019s Fruit seed yesterday evening and when he saw it, he couldn\u2019t help but be startled.(TL: opop seed growth~:D)On that patch of soft soil, grew a foot long sapling! The sapling was slender with plump and tender looking leaves along with a slender stem with dark red veins faintly crisscrossing it. Although the sapling was small, it possessed vitality that could not be ignored, trying to break free of the shackles of earth that were binding it, in order to mature.It\u2019s not right? Kai Yang thought his brain wasn\u2019t working properly. Only one night had passed, yet the Three Sun\u2019s Fruit Tree had already grown this big? For a moment, Kai Yang even thought that he had lost track of time and more than a few days had past already.Thinking carefully, he realised this couldn\u2019t be, for the Yang Qi within his body had not increased by a large amount, signalling that only one night had passed. Could all of this be caused by that drop of Yang Liquid that had seeped into the seed?This was quite likely, within Kai Yang\u2019s knowledge was information that said the Yang Liquid\u2019s use was plentiful and enormous and it didn\u2019t say it could only be used in battle.If it really was the Yang Liquid that caused the seed\u2019s mutation, it could explain the scene before his eyes.In one night, it had grown a foot, so after a couple more days, could it bear fruit? Thinking about this, Kai Yang\u2019s spirits rose, for the Three Sun\u2019s Fruit was an earth grade lower level spirit fruit and was a priceless treasure that could greatly aid his cultivation of the True Yang Tactics. One of these fruits would definitely be able to equal at least several days of practise.When he thought of this, Kai Yang thought that his investment was priceless. What he currently needed to do was to wait for confirmation and see how many days it would take for this fruit tree to blossom.This was next to Coiling Dragon Stream, and ordinarily no one would pass by. Kai Yang had cultivated here for many days, and apart from meeting that eleventh elder, he had not seen another. That\u2019s why he wasn\u2019t too afraid that this fruit tree would be discovered by others.Returning to the wooden hut, Kai Yang wanted to complete his assigned work for today. But after looking around for a while, he still couldn\u2019t find his broom, making him puzzled.After waiting for a while, a sweating Sky Tower disciple came back and in his hands was Kai Yang\u2019s broom.Kai Yang also recognised this person, he was one the people who was part of Su Mu\u2019s group and was at the tempered body fifth stage. He was called **.(TL: gg author, couldn\u2019t come up with a name so named them **.)Seeing Kai Yang standing there, ** immediately walked up: \u201cSenior brother, you have returned?\u201d\u201cEn, what did junior brother Zheng go to do? Why did you take my broom too?\u201d** laughed: \u201cI went to help you sweep and from now on you no longer need to worry about such trifles. From our group of disciples, everyday one of us will come and complete this task for you, so you can concentrate solely on your training.\u201d(TL: srsly, ** is getting bad, he even names him then goes back to **.)\u201cThis isn\u2019t too good.\u201d As Kai Yang listened, he swiftly waved his hands, although sweeping wasn\u2019t too important, it used a lot of energy. If it wasn\u2019t because he wanted to remain in Sky Tower, he would have long since resigned from this job. But as a trial disciple, if he didn\u2019t go receive some work to do, he wouldn\u2019t be able to survive in Sky Tower.** said: \u201cWhat is senior brother saying, us junior brothers should definitely help you. Last time, if it wasn\u2019t for you teaching Cheng Shao Feng and them a lesson, our anger really wouldn\u2019t be vented. Not to mention, there are many of us, if one person came each day in rotation, each person would only come here twice or thrice a month. There will no longer be any need for senior brother to wake up early each morning, and waste his time like this. Senior brother don\u2019t go refusing, think of our junior brother\u2019s faces, allow us to do this. But if you truly despise this, then forget it.\u201dIf it was presented in such a way, could Kai Yang really decline? Promptly he said: \u201cThen I shall ask this of my fellow junior brothers. Junior brother Zheng, please come inside to drink some water.\u201d\u201cNo need, young master Su issued an order that everyone must cultivate bitterly. If anyone dares to slack off, they won\u2019t be fellow brothers. I will leave now. Senior brother you must also work hard.\u201d As ** said this, he put down the broom and jogged out.Looking at his back, Kai Yang\u2019s heart warmed up, saving Su Mu that day was a good decision. This person was a true villain, if you obstruct him once, he would obstruct you ten times.It looks like he would no longer need to worry about wasting his time sweeping the grounds. Happy, Kai Yang walked out and went to catch a disciple at the tempered body seventh-eighth stage. He cupped his hands: \u201cJunior brother, please enlighten me!\u201dThat person\u2019s face immediately became bitter: \u201cSenior brother Kai\u2026\u2026there are many others, why did you choose me of all people?\u201dThese days, Kai Yang went out to duel every day and had long since fought his way to fame. Now, Sky Tower disciples that were at the tempered body stage, when they saw Kai Yang they would be afraid. He was no longer the treasure that lost every battle, giving out free contribution points, the current him had already won countless consecutive battles. Not only this, he had won each battle cleanly.p.s. Hey there! Sorry about yesterday, I busy and today I had to go with my grandparents to the dentist and that took a good half day. I can't a double today, so I'll it tomorrow and finish up the queue. And I just realised there's only 8 more days until Christmas (my time)! Can't wait for it to come, because that means my dad won't be breathing down my back telling me to study. -_- He does have a point, uni exams are next yr, urgh\u2026\u2026\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52 \u2013 A worthwhile investmentPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 52 \u2013 A worthwhile investmentTo this bittermelon faced disciple, Kai Yang laughed: \u201cNow, now don\u2019t be nervous, I am only intending to earn a few contribution points. Rest assured, I will be very light with my hits and promise that you will feel no lasting pain.\u201dTen breaths later, this disciple fell onto the ground and Kai Yang turned around and left.Xia Ning Chang stood in the top of a tree watching everything that had just happened. Her eyes narrowed into crescents, a faint, faint smile on her lips as she watched this disciple who once lost one hundred and forty seven times, slowly rise in power. This caused herself to give birth to a sense of accomplishment. Although Kai Yang\u2019s improvement had nothing to do with her, she had watched for over two years and long gotten used to watching this disciple. This could also be called being a silent guardian, with Kai Yang becoming stronger, Xia Ning Chang also felt very happy.Next to Coiling Dragon Stream, Kai Yang was once again training. It had been five days since the Three Sun\u2019s Fruit seed had been planted and it had already grown to ten feet; practically everyday there was an obvious change. At this very moment, the Three Suns\u2019 Fruit Tree was swaying with the wind, while three bright red flowers were in full bloom. It shouldn\u2019t take more than a few more days for these to bear fruit.At that time, Kai Yang would be able to heartily indulge himself.And in these past couple of days, Kai Yang\u2019s training had been quite fruitful. Within his dantian, another drop of Yang Liquid had been condensed and the True Yang Tactics had once again advanced.With his daily sweeping completed by others, Kai Yang had a lot more time to train.Also during this time, Kai Yang had been making various discreet inquires for news regarding Storm House, for he had killed Cheng Shao Feng and Niu Tao. There was no guarantee that trouble wouldn\u2019t arise, but what relieved Kai Yang was that Storm House didn\u2019t take any action. It looked like Hu Mei Er didn\u2019t betray him.That woman, was actually worthy of his trust!The eighth day of the month soon came and he could finally get a total sum of his accumulated contribution points.The eighth day of the previous month, he had just gotten the golden body and back then, he was only at the tempered body third stage. In one measly month, he had actually reached the tempered body eighth stage. This type of training speed, in this world no one could match it, even those so called earth shaking geniuses with their high-class elixirs aiding them couldn\u2019t train with such speed.Walking into the Contribution Hall, Treasurer Meng who was slouching behind the counter suddenly narrowed his eyes. He looked at Kai Yang surprised, he hadn\u2019t seen him recently and Kai Yang\u2019s strength had increased by a lot, a lot.His surprise lasted only a moment before Treasurer Meng regained his composure. It wasn\u2019t something he had never seen before, for he was also to see everyone in Sky Tower in his Contribution Hall. Thus, Kai Yang\u2019s increase in strength wouldn\u2019t make him too astonished. A youngster\u2019s growth period was dazzling and bright, so in the end, he had seen scenes like this one too many times.\u201cTreasurer Meng.\u201d Kai Yang called out in greeting.\u201cCome to exchange some things?\u201d Old man Meng looked up and down.\u201cEn. This month I should have fifty nine contribution points right?\u201dSweeping the grounds would give him ten points, while each duel would give two points. There were three days that he wasn\u2019t in the school, so he had battled a total of twenty seven times, but last time when he was drinking with Su Mu and got caught by that Dark Hall disciple he had been fined five points. Taking all of this into account, it should come to a total of fifty nine contribution points.\u201cThat\u2019s right. What do you want to exchange them for?\u201d\u201cTwenty nine Dead Jedi Tree Grasses and thirty Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flowers.\u201d It had been quite some time since he had used the incense burner, mainly because he lacked the required herbs. This provided no assistance to training his World Qi, but training his body in the tempered body stage was a wondrous opportunity.Old man Meng looked at Kai Yang with a gaze full of puzzlement, before walking to the back hall. Wrapping up Kai Yang\u2019s desired items, he came back out.Just as Kai Yang reached out his hands to accept the package, Treasurer Meng took back the package and asked: \u201cLittle Kai Yang, can you tell me, what thing did you eat when you went into Black Wind Mountains?\u201dHe was still interested in Kai Yang\u2019s good fortune.Kai Yang spoke a mouthful of nonsense: \u201cI don\u2019t really know. It was a beautiful red coloured fruit. Since I was hungry, I ate it.\u201d\u201cRed coloured fruit\u2026\u2026red coloured fruit\u2026\u2026..\u201d Old man Meng sank deep into his thoughts, but he couldn\u2019t think of the corresponding spirit fruit.After a good while, Treasurer Meng shook his head: \u201cNever mind. Aren\u2019t you going to save up your contribution points so you can exchange them for Essence Developer Pills?\u201dThe old Kai Yang, he would carefully calculate and ponder each usage of his contribution points, he was always stingy with them. But now, he was quite generous when it came to spending them, as soon as they entered his account he used them. This was very unlike him.Kai Yang smiled: \u201cI won\u2019t exchange for Essence Developer Pills anymore, for only one\u2019s hard work will make one strong. To put all my hopes on an immortal pill, my gaze was far too narrow.\u201dHearing this, Treasurer Meng looked at him deeply. Smiling, he nodded his head: \u201cNot bad, not bad. The fact that you are able to understand this point has surpassed this old man\u2019s expectations. Little Kai Yang, let this old man give you a word of advice.\u201d\u201cPlease say it Treasurer Meng!\u201d\u201cWork hard, do not waste your stroke of good fortune!\u201d\u201cThis disciple has received it!\u201dLeaving the Contribution Hall, Kai Yang sprinted back to Coiling Dragon Stream.Calling out the incense burner, putting the herbs inside, Kai Yang started to practise his punches and kicks. A familiar pressure descended, this pressure was definitely something Kai Yang, with his current strength, could take. In a short while, Kai Yang was gasping for breath, his body weary, but he did not give up and continued to slowly throw out punches and kicks. Each motion was incomparably hard, his strength quickly leaked away, his mental energy depleted; he had exhausted himself by pushing to the limit.A while later, Kai Yang could no longer endure, he fell head first to the ground.Forcing himself into a sitting position, he activated the True Yang Tactics, restoring his strength and mind.Originally he thought that the incense burner would have no effect on the development of World Qi, but now he knew he was wrong. Under the effects of that perfume, there was like a seal on the qi within his meridians, causing it to circulate one centimeter at a time, causing one to feel a sense of helplessness.The perfume obstructed the movement of his Yang World Qi, causing his cultivation speed to greatly slow down.Kai Yang was in no hurry to recall the burner, and instead decided to analyse it. He felt that this incense burner didn\u2019t just assist the development of one\u2019s body at the tempered body stage, it was a marvelous object, it wouldn\u2019t be a waste of time to examine it for a bit.With the assistance of the incense burner, Kai Yang\u2019s body grew stronger day by day, but the efficiency of the True Yang Tactics had been greatly reduced. The absorption speed of Yang Qi had been reduced by a large amount. After two-three days of training, he had hardly absorbed any.Could this incense burner really hinder the development of World Qi? Experimenting for two-three days, Kai Yang felt a bit hungry for qi.If this really was the case, then the incense burner\u2019s worth would be greatly diminished.Helplessly, Kai Yang could only choose to recall the incense burner as he recovered to avoid further impacting his World Qi. This sadly increased his recovery time.Once again exhausted, Kai Yang recalled the incense burner into the black book.Starting to cultivate the True Yang Tactics, Kai Yang\u2019s expression suddenly changed, carefully he felt his body.At that moment, the corners of Kai Yang\u2019s mouth twitched upwards into a smile. The speed of his World Qi in his meridians was one times faster.The faster the World Qi revolved, the quicker he absorbed Yang Qi. If it was during a battle, the killing potential of his attacks would be stronger.So it was like this! The incense burner\u2019s impact with regard to his World Qi was not one of obstruction, but one of benefit.The World Qi within him had adapted to the pressure from the perfume, so without the perfume's pressure, it would naturally revolve faster than before. This like how if a person got used to carrying a three thousand jin stone and it was suddenly exchange for a three hundred jin stone, then their steps would much faster.(TL: yea no. no one could just carry around a 1500kg stone like that ky. were not monsters like you.)This was the same concept.(TL: yeah, no kai yang. It\u2019s not.)Understanding this point, Kai Yang started to laugh.In the short term, the incense would only hinder Kai Yang\u2019s True Yang Tactics, but in the long term, this obstruction would result in great benefits and rewards. All in all this was a worthwhile investment!p.s. Well then, that was a very eventful chapter. Not really, but let's hope the next chapter will be more eventful. But Xia Ning Chang being happy for Kai Yang was sweet. ~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 \u2013 Tempered body ninth stagePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 53 \u2013 Tempered body ninth stageTen days later, the Three Sun\u2019s Fruit seed had finally ripened and quietly produced the Three Sun\u2019s Fruit! Dark red, they hung off the branches, enticing people to come and eat them.From these fruits, Kai Yang was able to sense a rich amount of Yang Qi.A insignificant ten days, actually allowed these earth grade lower class spirit fruits to ripen; when the melon is ripe, it will fall. That one drop of Yang Liquid was far too potent.Cautiously he reached out to pluck one of these Three Sun\u2019s Fruit. Holding it within his hands, Kai Yang played with it for a while, feeling really happy.But no matter how enticing this thing was, he would need to eat it for it to have an effect.Kai Yang didn\u2019t hesitate. Sitting down cross legged, he threw the Three Sun\u2019s Fruit directly into his mouth. Biting down, the sweet, fragrant fruit\u2019s flavour burst out, starting from the tip of his tongue and then traveling throughout the rest of his mouth, leaving an alluring fragrance behind.The spirit fruit entered his stomach and the True Yang Tactics started to revolve. His stomach felt like it was on fire, but to Kai Yang who was cultivating the True Yang Tactics, this temperature was the most comfortable, it even caused him feel relaxed.The Yang World Qi hidden within the earth grade lower class spirit fruit quickly flowed into his meridians. Filling up his meridians instantly, drip drip it sounded out and a drop of Yang Liquid condensed quietly.A short while later, another soft and crisp sound rang.In the end, it had condensed three drops of Yang Liquid before this earth grade lower class spirit fruit\u2019s energy disappeared.Within his dantian, there were now four drops of Yang Liquid. While three drops were newly condensed with the aid of the spirit fruit, with the remaining drop the result of ten days of hard cultivating by Kai Yang.With the incense burner\u2019s obstruction, these ten days of cultivation had been dark and tiring, but Kai Yang didn\u2019t really mind. How could he care about this petty thing at this point?Moreover, Kai Yang held a faint premonition that if he ate the remaining two spirit fruits, then he could possibly breakthrough into the tempered body ninth stage, touching the doors of the initial element stage.With this thought in his heart, without the slightest hesitation, Kai Yang ate the remaining two Three Sun\u2019s Fruit.The Yang World Qi dissolved within his stomach and a scorching hot heat flared up in his meridians. Kaii Yang\u2019s entire body suddenly became bright red.g Tactics frantically began to work while numerous dripping sounds rang out. In his dantian, one drop after the other had started to appear. Through Kai Yang\u2019s open pores, Yang Qi flowing out from Coiling Dragon Stream was sucked in steadily.The steady pulsing of World Qi within his meridians gradually became stronger, becoming more and more violent. If someone were to see Kai Yang\u2019s current appearance, they would be so shocked that their chin would drop to the floor. There had never been a tempered body martial practitioner who could condense such a rich amount of World Qi before.Tempered body martial practitioners\u2019 meridians were narrow and the space in their dantian was limited, not to mention they were completely unable to bear such a large and fierce amount of World Qi.The quantity of his World Qi was equivalent to a martial practitioner at the initial element stage. Though, Kai Yang was still only at the tempered body eighth stage.At that moment, Kai Yang felt a pressure and this pressure was inexplicable, like it existed between the heavens and the earth. These shackles were imposed upon him and if he didn\u2019t break these shackles, he would be unable to breakthrough.The blistering hot True Yang Tactics started to revolve again, burning away the unrelenting shackles. As time passed, Kai Yang could sense that the shackles preventing him from entering the next stage were slowly weakening. With his advancement at hand, Kai Yang\u2019s mind became clearer and the revolving speed of the True Yang Tactics sped up.Bang\u2026\u2026..it sounded, it was like he had taken off the chains binding him. All over his body, he felt light and all the pressure and discomfort he had felt previously left without a trace, leaving Kai Yang feeling bright and refreshed.Tempered body ninth stage! He was standing outside the doors to the initial element stage.Although he had broken through, that feeling of refreshment had yet to disappear. Moving causally, the ten drops of Yang Liquid within Kai Yang\u2019s datian started to rotate around and escaped in all directions, infiltrating into Kai Yang\u2019s five visceras, six bowels and meridians.(TL: hey, why isn\u2019t that a familiar term~! :D)The Yang Liquid\u2019s bright and burning strength burned away all of the impurities within, tempering his five visceras, six bowels and meridians.An iron ore need numerous revisions and temperings in order to for it take shape, so how could it be any different for the human body? Everytime a martial practitioner broke through a stage, they would use their body\u2019s world energy to refine their bodies. After each refinement, their strength would crazily increase.Kai Yang\u2019s current breakthrough was only a minor one, so there wasn\u2019t a lot of excess world energy within his body, but the Yang Liquid within him provided similar effects.A good while later, Kai Yang slowly opened his eyes, for he could sense that this breakthrough had caused his strength to increase by leaps and bounds. His current power was incomparable to his power before he broke through.If he were to meet with Cheng Shao Feng and Niu Tao now he was confident that he would be able to effortlessly defeat them, without using a single drop of Yang Liquid.Apart from an increase in strength, Kai Yang touched on an insight, it was just too profound and he was unable to comprehend it. He could only wait until his next breakthrough to try and understand it.His meridians were flooded with Yang World Qi, while his dantian was completely empty.Carefully sensing around, Kai Yang\u2019s face instantly darkened.The results he painstakingly achieved through these past few days of hard work had vanished in the blink of an eye. All the Yang Liquid condensed from the three Three Sun\u2019s Fruit, including his earlier condensed drop, a total of ten drops, were all gone, not a single wisp of Yang Liquid remained.Although he had gained great benefits, he didn\u2019t have any Yang Liquid.But it was no matter, as long as he had money if he wanted Yang Liquid, it was a relatively simple task. He just needed to buy some Yang attributed treasures and directly absorb them.The only problem right now was, Kai Yang was penniless. Apart from the spoils of war he had taken from Cheng Shao Feng and Niu Tao, he didn\u2019t have anything valuable.Sitting down he thought for awhile, Kai Yang found a solution.(TL: BECOME A FREAKING RECEPITARTER!!!!)He could not afford those treasures, could it be that he can\u2019t even afford their seeds?The benefit of the Three Sun\u2019s Fruit had been clearly displayed to him. With the power of the Yang Liquid, along with a suitable seed, the spirit fruit would easily grow.But these types of things were very scarce, after such a long time spent browsing within Black Wind Trade, he had yet to see anyone selling any seeds. It wasn\u2019t hard to understand why, for spirit grass and spirit tree seeds, not only did you have to find a suitable place to plant them, you also had to use a lot of effort to nurture them, not to mention you needed to wait a long time for them to bear fruit.Who would waste all that energy? If they had that much time and energy, they might as well go train. If no one bought them, then naturally no one would sell them. It was all about supply and demand.Kai Yang decided that he would buy them, furthermore he was seeking a large amount of seeds.With his mind made up, Kai Yang exited Sky Tower and towards Black Wind Trade.Although it was only his second time going, Kai Yang appeared at ease. It had been half a month since he had last came, Black Wind Trade was still bustling with commotion, Many martial practitioner came and went, the treasures in the various booths were all lined up creating a feast for the eyes.Making his way around the bustling booths, as expected, he did not find any seeds, but since he was prepared, Kai Yang wasn\u2019t too disappointed. Following his memory, Kai Yang walked to the place where that Blood Group disciple had been selling. He wanted to see if that guy had some extra seeds left.p.s. So got this chapter pressed out now. Now I need to go to bed, o.O it's 1:03am for me\u2026\u2026This chapter is still sponsored by Joseph G. so please thank him.

    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 \u2013 The thousand techniques of charmPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 54 \u2013 The thousand techniques of charmHe hadn\u2019t been walking for long before a clear, crisp voice of surprise rang out from beside him: \u201cSenior brother Kai!\u201dRaising his eyebrows, Kai Yang glanced over to see Li Yun Tian waving his hand at him. His face was brimming with enthusiasm and in front of him was a booth with various different items; some were herbs, there were also a couple of bottles and it looked they contained pills.\u201cWhy are you here with a booth?\u201d Kai Yang asked while walking over. He remembered that last time ** had told him Su Mu had ordered everybody to go and train with all their might.\u201cI just broke through, so Su Mu said I could come out for a walk to relax my heart and stabilize my foundations. Just as well, my fellow brothers needed some things for their cultivation so I came here to try my luck.\u201d He explained.\u201cIt was like this.\u201d Looking carefully at Li Yun Tian, Kai Yang saw that he really did look stronger than a few days prior. He should have broken through into the tempered body eighth stage.\u201cSenior brother, what did you come here for?\u201d Li Yun Tian asked curiously.\u201cI wanted to buy some things.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want? Come, look at my things and see if I have what you need. If you see anything, feel free to take it.\u201d Li Yun Tian said generously while pointing at his wares.\u201cDo you have any yang attributed spirit herb seeds?\u201dLi Yun Tian shook his head: \u201cI don\u2019t have any I\u2019m afraid. To my knowledge, very few people actually sell seeds in this market.\u201dIn other words, the market value of seeds wasn\u2019t high but they were still a rarity.\u201cI also came to test my luck.\u201d Kai Yang laughed out.\u201cHow about this, in the place of senior brother, I\u2019ll help you put up a notice to see if anyone has them. Since I\u2019ll be here for the next two days, and if your luck is good, someone might come to sell them.\u201d Li Yun Tian suggested.\u201cThat\u2019s also good. Then I shall trouble junior brother Li.\u201dOn the spot, Li Yun Tian put up a notice, writing one line he put the sign up next to him.Talking to Li Yun Tian a bit longer, Kai Yang learnt that the impact from last time was very big on Su Mu. Coupled with Su Yan\u2019s fierce lecturing, this playful young master had finally learnt to control himself. These days, he spent most of his time cultivating and had already broken through to the initial element stage.Saying goodbye to Li Yun Tian, Kai Yang walked straight to the place where he had brought that Bright Yang Stone.After seeing that familiar booth owner, Kai Yang let out a big sigh of relief. He had feared that he wouldn\u2019t be able to find him again.\u201cHey, little brother, you came again?\u201d This Blood Group disciple had watched Kai Yang and Hu Mei Er walk over last time, so his impression of Kai Yang was quite deep. He used honorifics to address him.(TLN: The honorific used would be \u60a8 \u2013 nin, a very formal way of addressing someone.)\u201cWhat do you want to buy this time?\u201d The booth owner asked.\u201cLast time you gave me that Three Sun\u2019s fruit seed, do you still have any?\u201d Not wasting any words, Kai Yang got straight to the point.The booth owner shook his head and said: \u201cThere are none left. I only had that one seed and, as you know, I used it as a gift and gave it to you little brother.\u201d\u201cIt was like this.\u201d Kai Yang couldn\u2019t help but be disappointed, \u201cI won\u2019t disturb you anymore.\u201dThere were a large amount of booths in Black Wind Trade, all with their own varieties of goods, if his luck was good, then he might be able to find his desired items.The Blood Group disciple looked over Kai Yang\u2019s back, his face revealing his internal struggle before he suddenly called out: \u201cLittle brother, please wait a moment.\u201dKai Yang turned around: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cBack then, there wasn\u2019t just one seed of the Three Sun\u2019s fruit. There were a small number of them, but I only received one.\u201dHearing this new information, Kai Yang looked overjoyed: \u201cWhere are the other seeds?\u201d\u201cThey were taken by other disciples. Little brother, if you really want them, then you could go ask those disciples.\u201d\u201cWhere are they currently?\u201d Kai Yang hastily asked.The owner\u2019s face was a bit hesitant, he seemed to be deliberating for a good while before saying: \u201cThey are in our group\u2019s mining area, extracting Bright Yang Stones and other things. Even if it\u2019s one of our disciples, it\u2019s not a place one can tread easily. Let alone an outsider like you little brother.\u201d\u201cWhen will they leave?\u201d Kai Yang pressed, unwilling to give in.\u201cIn the short term, I\u2019m afraid they will not leave so soon. You may have to wait one or two months.\u201dKai Yang\u2019s eyebrows wrinkled, such a long time. By that time, even the cauliflower dish would have long since turned cold.\u201cYou don\u2019t have any methods to allow them to leave earlier? Don\u2019t worry, I only want to go find them to buy their Three Sun\u2019s Fruit seed.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t, I am only an ordinary disciple in the Blood Group.\u201d The booth owner forced out a bitter smile, before his eyes swivelled around a bit. \u201cBut another person can.\u201dKai Yang\u2019s face shook: \u201cI would like to hear who.\u201dGlancing around, the booth owner\u2019s expression was a bit ambiguous: \u201cYou can go ask my young lady for help. With her assistance, the miners wouldn\u2019t obstruct you.\u201dHearing this, Kai Yang\u2019s expression became quite strange.Stammering out: \u201cMy relationship with your young lady is quite ordinary.\u201d\u201cEn, en.\u201d The booth owner repeatedly nodded his head, it was quite obvious that he didn\u2019t believe Kai Yang. Pointing at a far wooden house he said: \u201cIt is quite a coincidence, today the young lady has also come to the trade area and is resting in that wooden house. If you urgently need those seeds, there\u2019s no harm in asking my young lady.\u201dKai Yang was slightly hesitant, with the current situation between them and all, it wasn\u2019t the best idea. He had completely offended that woman, and now he needed to go ask her for help. Where would he put his face?But if he didn\u2019t go find her, he didn\u2019t have any other good ideas.Unwillingly, Kai Yang continued to search around Black Wind Trade. Although he found some seeds, they were not Yang attributed and were completely worthless to him.Helpless, Kai clenched his teeth and thought \u201cfine, if I lose face, I\u2019ll lose it. It\u2019s not like I have done something unforgivable to her, why would I be afraid of her?\u201dThese wooden houses were all residences of each respective factions top disciples. Since Hu Mei Er was the Blood Group Head\u2019s daughter, although her strength wasn\u2019t high, her status was, so resting in there was not unusual.In a thirty foot radius, there weren\u2019t any people to be seen. All of the martial practitioners held great respect for the residents of these wooden houses. That is why they would not set up their booths near these wooden huts.Arriving at the wooden house the booth owner pointed out, Kai Yang stood at it\u2019s door. Just as he say wondering how to ask, from within the house, a cute voice sounded out: \u201cWho\u2019s outside?\u201dIt sounded like Hu Mei Er\u2019s voice, but it was also a bit strange.Since he had already arrived here, Kai Yang naturally wouldn\u2019t retreat. Speaking out: \u201cLady Mei Er, It\u2019s me, Kai Yang. Come out and see.\u201dInside was different from what Kai Yang expected. Sitting inside were two girls who looked practically the same, even their figures were the same. At a glance, you would think that it was a mirror reflecting the same appearance; one was the real figure and other the reflection.Hearing Kai Yang\u2019s voice, astonishment and shock flashed through one of the girl\u2019s eyes. Turning around, she went to speak to the other girl: \u201cLittle sister, that person is the one you were talking about, Kai Yang?\u201dThe one being questioned was Hu Mei Er. She nodded her head and said: \u201cEn. Why would he come and find me?\u201dShe thought that ever since he had split from her that day, they would never cross paths again.The other person coldly laughed: \u201cLooks like he isn\u2019t one of those people who aren\u2019t swayed by beauty. Some men will pretend to be noble and virtuous but are experts in baiting women like you. Then they will capture your body and mind, confining you to eternal damnation.\u201dHu Mei Er\u2019s face reddened. Angrily she said: \u201cOlder sister, he isn\u2019t like you think he is.\u201dHu Jiao Er chuckled: \u201cIf he isn\u2019t, why would he come and find you after such a long time? He definitely knows that you think about him day and night, and has come to attack.\u201dHu Mei Er displeased, said: \u201cOlder sister, you only like to think about people in a negative light.\u201dIf he really was one of those people, then that day at the lakeside, she would have lost her chastity. No male could resist that type of enticement.p.s. So that is the last sponsored chapter by Joseph G. I'm going to go back to sleep now, I think I caught a summer flu. My throat's sore and hot, dizzy, body aches and I've a blocked nose. T_T \ud83d\ude22.

    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 \u2013 Good people are better than good teaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 55 \u2013 Good people are better than good teaBut why did he come over to find her? Although Hu Mei Er didn\u2019t believe her older sister\u2019s words, she still had some doubts in her heart.Seeing her expression, Hu Jiao Er sighed: \u201cTo obstinately persist and go about things in the wrong way, will sooner or later lead to your own demise.\u201dAnnoyed, Hu Mei Er said: \u201cI won\u2019t talk to you about it anymore. Since he came to find me, it must be something urgent. Let me go and ask.\u201dJust as she was about to rise, she was pulled back by her older sister. Hu Jiao Er\u2019s adorable eyes spun around, cutely she laughed out: \u201cLittle sis, how about I make a bet with you?\u201d\u201cWhat type of bet?\u201d Hu Mei Er asked in doubt.\u201cWe are betting whether or not he is a hypocrite! If he is really as you say he is, then he should be able to keep a calm mind. If he isn\u2019t, then don\u2019t blame your sister for being vicious and merciless!\u201d As Hu Jiao Er spoke, a cold light slowly appeared in her eyes.These past several years, with Hu Mei Er\u2019s various stirrings outside, the only reason why she was able to retain her purity was mainly because of her older sister. Those who wanted to force Hu Mei Er to do anything, had all died in the most unusual ways.In regards to her sister\u2019s methods, Hu Mei Er knew more about them than anyone. So when she saw her attitude, she knew for certain that she was hatching a nasty plan.\u201cOlder sister, what do you want to do?\u201d Hu Mei Er cried out in alarm.\u201cYou just need to sit and watch carefully, humph!\u201d With a wave of her white hand, a glossy smoke covered her younger sister. Then Hu Mei Er\u2019s figure slowly darkened and disappeared from sight.\u201cOlder sister, don\u2019t act recklessly!\u201d Hu Mei Er exerted all her strength, banging at the smoke yet no sounded escaped. In fact, she couldn\u2019t even walk more than ten feet from where she had been standing when her sister executed her technique. She could only watch, her anticipation rising.Outside, Kai Yang had been waiting for quite a long time and he still saw no signs of Hu Mei Er coming to open the door. He could only helplessly sigh.It looks like he offended her really badly that day, though her anger would be justified if that is the case. If it was any other female that was spoken about like that, they would not take it lying down.Never mind, Kai Yang never really held any hope that she would help, the only reason he came was to give it a shot. Now that he saw that she didn\u2019t want to talk to him, he naturally wouldn\u2019t force her to.Just as he was about turn around and leave, from within the house sounded Hu Mei Er\u2019s voice: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in.\u201dKai Yang was startled, muttering to himself for a while before pushing the door open and walking in.Walking in and closing the door behind him, all the noise from outside suddenly vanished, replaced instead by a tranquil silence.Kai Yang looked around and took in his surroundings, the size of the house was about the same as the one Su Yan was staying in. Of course, it\u2019s interior was superior to Su Yan\u2019s. Su Yan\u2019s room was empty, cold just like her own frostiness.Where as here, there was a table, two chairs and a sweet smelling bed. On the sweet smelling bed hung some pink curtains as thin as cicada wings. On the bed was a petite pillow and the entire room was permeated by the scent of a female.Here and Su Yan\u2019s place were two completely different worlds.Hu Jiao Er sat next to the table, her face full of smiles, as she faced the door. Her pair of charming eyes, tender and beautiful, glistened with moisture. With a weird gaze and a smile hiding her intentions, she looked at him, a red blush was blooming across her face, causing her to appear very enchanting.Her two jade arms were uncovered, revealing her snow-white, infant like skin and her wooden clogs displayed her delicate toes. He wasn\u2019t sure what she had put on her toenails, but it had turned them a purple colour making her seem like a wild beauty. \u2026\u2026\u2026..Seeing this, Kai Yang\u2019s heart jumped, he didn\u2019t know why, but today Hu Mei Er seemed extra enchanting. She was far more beautiful than when he had last met her a few days ago.(TL: Kai Yang, don\u2019t thump over mere nail polish on toes please. Have some dignity.)But her smile caused Kai Yang to feel awkward, he thought she was mocking him.At that moment, Hu Mei Er was holding a spread out fan and fanning herself. With vigorous movements, the winds blew up in wisps, giving her the appearance of a grand noble.Embroidered on that fan was a picture of a court lady, and that court lady\u2019s figure and full and developed, posing in an alluring position. If there were less clothes embroidered on her then it would be **.(TLN: Court lady isn\u2019t the most accurate, but it sounds the best. It should be just a picture of traditional painting of a beautiful woman. But of course, that sounds like a mouthful in the translation right?)Giving it a glance, Kai Yang thought that lady was really outrageous. If any other female saw this, they would hide their faces in shame, yet this woman was able to use this fan, clearly displaying that she wasn\u2019t ordinary.It was just\u2026\u2026after not meeting for a good half a month, how could Hu Mei Er undergo such a big change?Although she kept her eyes on him, Kai Yang did not shy away in the slightest as he walked over to her. Her behaviour that day, Kai Yang had seen it all, it was like he was holding her pigtails, so how could he be afraid of her?Being looked at like this Hu Jiao Er, who was pretending to be Hu Mei Er, was unable to endure. This person was really audacious, how could be there be anybody who would face a beauty like this? He didn\u2019t even know to let up a bit, this was a bit too unromantic.However\u2026\u2026.his gaze was very clear, there was not the slightest amount of obscene desires in his gaze.Arriving at the table side, Kai Yang cupped his hands and said: \u201cLady Mei Er, we haven\u2019t seen each other for more than ten days and you look more enchanting.\u201dHearing these words caused Hu Jiao Er to ge ge laugh while she replied: \u201cYou also know how to flatter others?\u201dIn regards to Kai Yang\u2019s situation, Hu Mei Er had informed her of everything, so Hu Jiao knew how to properly reply. She wasn\u2019t afraid that she would be exposed.Kai Yang laughed: \u201cI am only speaking the truth.\u201dAs he said this, he sat down opposite of her disregarding courtesy. A weight had been lifted within his heart, it looked like this woman wasn\u2019t angry at him, making his task much easier to complete.\u201cLady Mei Er, the purpose of my trip this time\u2026..\u201d Kai Yang had decided to discuss his goal directly. This would make him seem a bit more sincere.\u201cLet\u2019s not rush things.\u201d Hu Jiao Er put down the cloth fan and quietly got up. Taking up the teapot, she walked over to Kai Yang\u2019s side to pour him some tea: \u201cIt\u2019s hot outside, so drink some tea to moisten your parched throat. Rest for a bit then talk.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s ok!\u201d Kai Yang nodded his head while enjoying her warmth. Picking up the tea cup, he drank some tea before his expression suddenly became strange.Hu Jiao Er returned to her seat and sat down. Putting her hands on her cheeks, calm and unruffled she said to him: \u201cJunior Kai, how does this tea taste?\u201dKai Yang was thinking about something else, but as he lifted his head he looked at Hu Jiao Er deeply before replying: \u201cThese leaves are as flat as disks, very straight, it is as green as emeralds, with a flowery background taste. This is a first rate tea.\u201dHu Jiao Er was stunned and stared on blankly. She was full of astonishment as she looked at Kai Yang: \u201cYou understand?\u201dShe herself didn\u2019t understand, she only brought it to drink. But Kai Yang had described is clearly and accurately, how could this not flabbergast her?Kai yang shook his head: \u201cA little, but I\u2019m not too proficient.\u201d\u201cThen how does this tea compare to me?\u201d Hu Jiao Er let out a breath like lilies. Kai Yang was only a table distance away from her, so he could smell her breath, sweet like the clear mountain spring, pure as 100 year old wine, it lingered in the memory after it had faded away.For no reason, Kai Yang felt his breath speed up by a bit, his blood had also sped up. He blurted out: \u201cGood people are better than good tea.\u201d\u201cGe ge\u2026\u2026\u201d Hu Jiao Er\u2019s laugh was like flowers blossoming and swaying in the wind, her chest quivering.Kai Yang\u2019s eyes were fixed on that big and plump chest, and his adam\u2019s apple bobbed.(TL: che.)Intentionally or not, Hu Jiao picked up that cloth fan again and blocked the springtime scene of her chest, but intentionally revealed that exposed lady picture. Kai Yang\u2019s face immediately became red.p.s. Hey guys! Sorry about yesterday, I didn't get to crawl out of bed and I slept for most of the day. Was reading some of our comments and to clarify, I live in the Southern Hemisphere, where is it summer in Christmas. T_T To boot, Australia has no snow\u2026\u2026\u2026..so it's hot Christmas for us. Boohoo. Also I'm nice and refreshed now, that day of sleeping was really good and energising. So here was your first regular chapter of the week!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 \u2013 ProbingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 56 \u2013 ProbingSeeing this scene, the hidden Hu Mei Er immediately shouted out: \u201cOlder sister, you are shameless!\u201dBut, how could her voice possibly transmit outside the smoke barrier? Even a fragrance pressing to escape, still could not. Too despicable, for someone at older sister\u2019s level, to play around with a tempered body martial practitioner was simply too easy.If this was a normal interaction, Hu Mei Er felt that Kai Yang definitely wouldn\u2019t reveal any abnormal reactions. But if her older sister had done anything behind the scenes, then she could not say for certain if this would remain the case.Inside the house, Hu Jiao Er abruptly stood up again and step by step, she started to walk over to that sweet smelling bed. Looking back, she laughed: \u201cWait a moment. I need to retrieve something to give to you.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Kai Yang\u2019s brow was wrinkled, as he faintly felt that something was wrong, but he couldn\u2019t exactly put his finger on it.Arriving at the side of the sweet smelling bed, Hu Jiao Er knelt over. Half-kneeling on the bed, she started to search around and the thin clothes she wore were unable to completely cover her thousand charms. The clothes stuck perfectly to her body, highlighting her perfectly round buttocks, demonstrating unparallelled allure.Kai Yang\u2019s heart rate increased by leaps and bounds, while his throat burned.For a good while, Hu Jiao Er remained in this alluring position. Then suddenly, in a cute voice, she cried out.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Kai Yang\u2019s expression changed and he hurried over.At that moment, Hu Jiao Er retreated from the bed. Her steps unsteady, she fell directly into Kai Yang\u2019s arms and he firmly caught her.Both of their legs touched, and for some unknown reason, both of them fell onto the bed.Hu Jiao Er was on top, Kai Yang was on the bottom and the fiery human body heat on his chest caused his throat to become dry. Looking down at that beautiful face with two tender lips, Kai Yang forcibly suppressed his ** and said: \u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d\u201cThere is a bug!\u201d Hu Jiao Er put on a show; her acting skills were really good. Her two small hands clutched onto Kai Yang\u2019s clothes not letting go as she displayed an easily frightened appearance.Kai Yang laughed out involuntarily: \u201cWhere is it?\u201d\u201cOver there\u2026\u2026.\u201dLooking in the direction Hu Jiao Er was pointing, Kai Yang actually saw a bug slowly crawling around. He thought that women were really interesting; she was already a martial practitioner, yet such a small and insignificant bug could scare her to such a degree. Reaching out, he squashed it before patting her on the shoulder: \u201cIt\u2019s alright now. It has already been dealt with by me.\u201d\u201cThere are definitely more\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Hu Jiao Er persisted. As she said this, she looked around in all directions, her gaze wasn\u2019t limited to the bed as it swept over Kai Yang\u2019s cheeks and lips, causing Kai Yang\u2019s recently calmed emotions to flare back up.\u201cThere are none left.\u201d Kai Yang felt it wasn\u2019t suitable for this to continue, because if someone were to burst into the room at any moment and were to see himself and Hu Mei Er like this, then they would unable to wash clean their reputations with three rivers and five lakes.\u201cThere really aren\u2019t anymore?\u201d A flash of astonishment flashed across Hu Jiao Er\u2019s eyes, she would never have imagined that Kai Yang really could control himself in this position. He didn\u2019t try to take advantage of her at all.Just then, if Kai Yang really had done anything, then he would definitely have lost an arm or two.Although her heart was still unsettled, Hu Jiao Er meekly crawled off Kai Yang\u2019s body.Kai Yang sat up, embarrassed, he lifted his head to look at Hu Mei Er, her face was also bright red, as she shuffled over to sit next to him.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your foot?\u201d Kai Yang asked.\u201cWhen I tripped, I think I sprained it.\u201d After one scheme failed, Hu Jiao Er immediately moved onto another. She thought, \u2018Great Aunt, today I definitely must reveal your true colours. I must see if it\u2019s a black or red heart.\u2019\u201cLet me see\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Squatting down, Kai Yang went to pick up Hu Jiao Er\u2019s foot. Looking at it, he saw that her ankle was truly a bit red, proving it really had been injured.It had actually been injured. In order to truly probe Kai Yang, a small sacrifice like this was nothing to Hu Jiao Er.Kai Yang wasn\u2019t shy about anything, after all Hu Mei Er wasn\u2019t too concerned with etiquette. Previously, she had used herself to entice him, so how would holding her foot be anything to be concerned over?\u201cDon\u2019t move around!\u201d Kai Yang commanded before reaching into his clothes to pull out a bottle.This bottle contained Sky Tower\u2019s Blood Clotting Cream and after he took it out, Kai Yang paused, as if he was thinking about something. After a good while, Kai Yang finally poured out some cream onto his palm. Then, carefully he started to smear it on the swollen area of Hu Jiao Er\u2019s foot.A weak pulse of Yang World Qi also started to revolve, assisting the with the defusing of the medicine.Hu Jiao Er\u2019s adorable body quivered for a bit, she told herself that she really had lost big time! So many years had past, and her jade body had never been touched by others. But because she wanted to make a bet with her younger sister, she was hugged and touched by another. Not only could she not walk, she also couldn\u2019t make them take responsibility.Although she felt wronged, she no longer felt any more pain on her body.That big hand was gently rubbing her ankle, his figure serious, his movement soft and gentle. His coarse and rough hands rubbing on her tender skin sent up waves of numbness.She steadily got and up accompanied by him, he carried an air not befitting of his age.Following Kai Yang\u2019s movements, Hu Jiao Er\u2019s imagination became wild and a peculiar feeling appeared within her body. This feeling caused her to became flustered and her maiden heart started to beat erratically. Heat started to rise in her abdomen, like lightening striking downwards causing her to clamp her legs together. She was afraid that if she didn\u2019t clamp her legs closed, then that hot feeling out come flooding out.\u201cKai Yang\u2026\u2026\u201d A strange voice shouted out from Hu Jiao Er\u2019s mouth. She was currently too embarrassed to show her face, she had never imagined that she would ever make this type of voice.\u201cEn?\u201d Kai Yang lifted up his head to see Hu Jiao Er\u2019s pair of watery and beautiful eyes staring down at him and her face no longer held any other colour apart from a scarlet red.\u201cDo you want to\u2026\u2026do some other things?\u201d Hu Jiao Er tightly clenched her ruby lips, proceeding to commence her final attack!If Kai Yang immediately replied in agreement, then she would able to discard all her current emotions and retreat. Then she wouldn\u2019t be merciless to Kai Yang!Would he agree? Hu Jiao Er was nervous, hoping that he would agree so she could be free, but on the other hand, she also wanted him to refuse to prove that her younger sister didn\u2019t misread him and that she had mistaken him! This nervousness and struggle caused her to be extremely indecisive inside.Even Hu Jiao Er was worried, so how could the confined Hu Mei Er not be worried? She had ceased all useless shouts, and was closely looking at Kai Yang, unsure what response he would give in the end.Kai Yang looked straight at Hu Jiao Er, intentionally moving, while she had her heart in her throat afraid that Kai Yang would say the word \u201cOkay\u201d.Suddenly, Kai Yang softly chuckled. Slowly, without any rush, he put away the bottle of Blood Clotting Cream seriously.\u201cLady!\u201d Kai Yang muttered.\u201cEn?\u201d Hu Jiao Er nervous, disregarded Kai Yang\u2019s addressing of herself.\u201cJust then, the bottle of Blood Clotting Cream was my most precious possession. Although it\u2019s value isn\u2019t that high, it is the proof of human kindness.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your meaning?\u201d Hu Jiao Er looked distracted. She had asked if he wanted to or not, so why was he talking about this? What was his meaning?Standing up, Kai Yang looked down at Hu Jiao Er: \u201cWhat I want to tell you is, I used this precious bottle of cream to treat your injury so I ask that you no longer hold any grudges with me. Let us end this farce here and now please.\u201dp.s. Sorry for the delayed release. This is yesterday's chapter, because Ben had to go out and couldn't edit the chapter. I'll start to work on today's chapter soon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 \u2013 One big, one smallPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHeyo~! This is a SPONSORED~ chapter. I just wanted to say after my big break of silence, I have decided to drop this project as due to person difficulties and so this is the last chapter. D; For more information, please read below.Chapter 57 \u2013 One big, one small\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Hu Jiao Er\u2019s face changed as she forced out a smile: \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t have found out that she was impersonating her younger sister, right? It\u2019s not possible. He was only at the tempered body ninth stage, how could he possibly see through her, an initial element stage practitioner\u2019s schemes? Nonetheless, she and her younger sister looked almost the same; regardless of if it was their voices or figures, they were all similar. Even the elders in the group often mistook them for each other, how could he have such an ability?Kai Yang looked at her indifferently, lightly laughing: \u201cLady, then you are unwilling to admit it?\u201d\u201cAdmit what? I really don\u2019t know what you are talking about.\u201d Hu Jiao Er insisted for the last time.Kai Yang massaged his temples and helplessly said: \u201cThen I shall say it clearly. Lady, you are not Hu Mei Er. I think\u2026\u2026.you are her older twin sister.\u201dHu Jiao Er looked on blankly, before recovering and chuckled: \u201cWhy do you say this?\u201dThis time, she didn\u2019t force it anymore, but looked at Kai Yang full of interest, she also wanted to know in what aspect she had exposed herself. If Kai Yang couldn\u2019t give any concrete reasons why, then it would be clear that he was using words to swindle her.It could be that he currently held suspicions, but was ultimately unsure, therefore he wanted her to admit it. This is was what Hu Jiao Er guessed was going on.\u201cLady, you are now testing my observation skills.\u201d Kai Yang didn\u2019t get angry and he laughed. Standing up, he walked over to the table and picked up the teacup from which he had drunk from earlier and pursed his lips: \u201cActually, I still wasn\u2019t sure that you really were not Hu Mei Er. Though now, I am certain that you are not her!\u201dHu Jiao Er stared blankly and became really angry, to the point that she wanted to grind her teeth; it turns out that his words just then really were probing her! This infuriated her! She, a initial element practitioner, with a moment's carelessness was played by this tempered body youngster. This was such a defeat, she had lost much face.She held no interest in denying it further. Hu Jiao Er laughed softly, and repositioned herself on the bed, displaying her alluring body fully, while her bewitching eyes sized Kai Yang up. Her voice gentle, she said: \u201cAt what moment did you start having your doubts?\u201d\u201cFrom the time I drank the tea.\u201d Kai Yang lightly hit the teacup within his hands, \u201cAlthough the tea was very pleasant, it couldn\u2019t fully cover the female scent. Also, on this cup there is a faint marking of lips, and I concluded that it hadn\u2019t been too long since someone last used it right? And that person should be Lady Hu Mei Er.\u201d(TLN: GG Kai Yang. What are you trying to be? Sherlock? This is xianxia not a detective/mystery novel. -_-)\u201cJust from that, you didn\u2019t believe I was Mei Er?\u201d Hu Jiao Er was amazed.\u201cOf course it wasn\u2019t just from that.\u201d Kai Yang slowly shook his head, \u201cThe second point that arose my suspicion was your temperament! I do not believe that in ten days or so, a woman\u2019s temperament can undergo such a large change. Putting it nicely, Lady Mei Er\u2019s charm is more young and tender, whereas your charm is more mature and developed.\u201d\u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d Hu Jiao Er started to laugh while covering her mouth, \u201cPlease continue, do you have any more reasons?\u201d\u201cThirdly, your scent and Lady Mei Er\u2019s are very similar, but if you are to smell carefully, they are still different. Her\u2019s is more sweet while yours possesses a more subtle elegance.\u201d\u201cStinking brat!\u201d Hu Jiao Er\u2019s face was a nice pink hue because Kai Yang\u2019s somewhat straightforward answers had caused her to be unable to maintain her calm. Thinking back at how she had wanted to probe him and the self-sacrifices she had made, Hu Jiao Er couldn\u2019t help but want to slap this confident male in front of her into a meat patty.\u201cFourthly\u2026\u2026\u201d Kai Yang ignored Hu Jiao Er\u2019s oppressive glare and continued to speak.\u201cThere is more\u2026\u2026.\u201d This startled Hu Jiao Er. She would have never guessed that this tempered body youngster would be able to see this many holes, in her seemingly flawless plan.\u201cHe he, the fourth point is the injury on this lady\u2019s foot. That injury looks like it is a sprain, but it is really a self-inflicted injury, caused internally and this was the greatest clue. Although Lady Mei Er is a young lady, she is still a martial practitioner. How could it be so easy for her to sprain her ankle?\u201d\u201cThis was actually my own negligence.\u201d Hu Jiao Er lightly nodded her head. Back then, she was only concerned with revealing Kai Yang\u2019s true colours, thus she had not thought too deeply.As she lifted up her head, she saw that Kai Yang was still deep in thought, so Hu Jiao Er said: \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you there were more flaws that you saw through.\u201dHu Jiao Er was quite unconvinced. How could her plan, that she thought was flawless and perfect, actually be full of holes and flaws in his eyes? Not to mention all of his analysis was clear and logical, leaving no room for argument.Looking at this stinking brat filled her with loathing.If he dared to point out anymore flaws, this Lady would definitely show him some attitude. He completely forgot to leave others some face.\u201cThen I\u2019ll say no more.\u201d Kai Yang replied as he wrinkled his brows.Hearing this, Hu Jiao Er became unhappy and her charming eyes turned frosty. Laughing captivatingly, biting down with her ivory teeth she spat out a single word: \u201cSpeak!\u201d\u201cI better not say anymore!\u201d He said shaking his head.Hu Jiao Er\u2019s anger rose: \u201cIf I want you to speak then speak. How could there be someone like you who likes leaving a person hanging.\u201dKai Yang bitterly laughed: \u201cI\u2019m afraid that if I say it, I could cause this lady to become angry.\u201dHer almond eyes narrowing, she replied: \u201cMake me angry? What is this flaw, is it an upsetting thing?\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d\u201cThen I want to hear it even more.\u201d\u201cBut you must promise me that you not become angry.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t say it, then how will I know whether or not I will be angry or not?\u201d\u201cNevermind then.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026.don\u2019t you know that when you are arguing with a woman, you should back down a step?\u201d Hu Jiao Er was gloomy inside. This youngster seemed shrewd, but he was actually a stubborn and cold headed youth, without a shred of sensitivity.\u201cIf I back down a step, I would become injured. I think\u2026\u2026\u2026.I would be unable to match you.\u201d Kai Yang\u2019s face was serious.\u201cI see that you still have some sensitivity!\u201d Laughing proudly, Hu Jiao Er sprang up from the bed, carrying with her a sweet aroma, both from the bed and herself over to the table. Her clothes dancing around, she sat down and gracefully looked towards Kai Yang. Muttering for a while, she responded: \u201cOkay then, I promise that I will not become angry with you.\u201d\u201cAnd you also promise not to hit me.\u201d\u201cFine!\u201d Biting her ivory teeth, Hu Jiao Er continued, \u201cTell me, what is this final flaw?\u201dHis face stern Kai Yang answered: \u201cActually, it can\u2019t really be counted as a flaw. It\u2019s just that between you and Lady Mei Er there is a slight difference between you.\u201d\u201cWhere is this difference?\u201d Hu Jiao Er looked at him oddly because she and her younger sister were both practically carved from the same mold. So where would this difference be?Kai Yang opened and closed his mouth and hesitated for a good while before mumbling out: \u201cIt\u2019s your buttocks, one side is smaller than the other! It is incomparable to Lady Mei Er\u2019s well portioned one!\u201dAs soon as he said this, Hu Jiao Er\u2019s face suddenly became bright red and all of her initial element stage World Qi burst out, engulfing the house in a powerful gale.\u201cPlease remember the words you just said!\u201d Remaining calm, his heart steady, Kai Yang reminded her faintly.Hu Jiao Er\u2019s imposing air unexpectedly receded. She was so furious her entire body was shaking yet she could not vent her anger, she nearly shattered her ivory teeth from biting down too hard. It wasn\u2019t till after a long time had past that she banged the table and spoke out in her sweet voice: \u201cUtter rubbish!\u201dFor a proper girl to utter these coarse words, one could only imagine Hu Jiao Er\u2019s current rage.This brat should be made into mincemeat, for he dared to evaluate her buttocks as one small and one big. Is this something a man should say? How is one smaller than the other? Aren\u2019t they clearly well proportioned?This stinking brat, I\u2019m afraid that you don\u2019t know how to write the word death right?p.s.

    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 \u2013 Attracting troublePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 58 \u2013 Attracting troubleAs Hu Jiao Er flew into a rage due to her humiliation, KaiYang immediately went to comfort her: \u201cLady, you do not need to worry about it. If you don\u2019t look carefully, you cannot see any difference.\u201dHer face turned cold as she murderously looked at Kai Yang: \u201cIn other words, you looked closely right?\u201dNot only did Kai Yang cough a few times, he also looked embarrassed: \u201cI did look a few times.\u201dYou can\u2019t blame him! She had stuck out her own bottom towards him, and could it be that he had to pretend as if he saw nothing? Kai Yang also felt quite wronged inside.\u201cWith these points, if I still couldn\u2019t see that you and Lady Hu Mei Er are two different people, then my eyes would have grown in vain.\u201d Kai Yang laughed faintly.After her anger had subsided, thinking it over, Hu Jiao Er couldn\u2019t help but feel a little shock.Seeing this man called Kai Yang, he had incomparable insight. Just from entering this room, looking around and drinking some tea, he had seen through it all. This type of ability is not possessed by everyone, let alone the fact that she had personally tried to entice him and ultimately failed to do so. This person\u2019s perseverance and personality are considerably good, to not be charmed by good looks. He was a man of determination.Genius! Although he is young, you couldn\u2019t deny the fact that he was a genius.Arriving at such a point, Hu Jiao Er\u2019s eyes rolled and she gave Kai Yang a charming look: \u201cKai Yang right? Seeing that you have just offended me, this lady will give you two choices.\u201d\u201cWhat choices?\u201d Kai Yang asked.\u201cThe first choice, the hand that touched me shall be the one to be decapitated and the eye that saw me, shall be dug out and only then would I forgive your previous actions.\u201d As Hu Jiao Er said those words, she maintained her smile, along with a gentle voice. It was like a wife talking to her husband, but within her words there was an unreasonable amount of cruelty and bloodthirst.Kai Yang shook his head: \u201cLet me hear the second choice.\u201d\u201cClever.\u201d Hu Jiao Er smiled: \u201cThe second choice, that is to leave Sky Tower and enter our Blood Group. I will ask father to bestow upon you the position of Small Captain. From what I know, in Sky Tower Pavilion, you are the lowest rank Trial Disciple; you are bullied, with no access to good cultivation resources. But if you join my Blood Group, your treatment would be at least a hundredfold better than it is currently. How about it, aren\u2019t my offers generous?\u201d\u201cAre there any other choices?\u201d\u201cNone!\u201d\u201cThen I shall choose neither of them.\u201d As he said this, Kai Yang secretly started to operate his True Yang Tactics, staying vigilant and alert towards Hu Jiao Er.\u201cYou want to force my hand?\u201d Hu Jiao Er repeatedly laughed coldly.\u201cI do not think that you would really attack, because this isn\u2019t the Blood Group\u2019s territory. As soon as there is a hint of battle, Sky Tower and it\u2019s guardian disciples would all come to investigate. At that moment, problems and inconveniences would occur for you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re just an insignificant Trial Disciple, if I want to kill you I can, so what can Sky Tower do? At most, all I need to do is compensate them with a couple of items. In all likelihood, they wouldn\u2019t even really care about your death that much!\u201d\u201cLady, if you really want to kill me, you wouldn\u2019t talk rubbish with me.\u201d Although Kai Yang appeared calm and composed, he was actually nervous on the inside, because a woman\u2019s heart was like a needle at the bottom of the ocean, who knew what they were really thinking.He was already regretting speaking the truth. As expected, you cannot trust a woman\u2019s words, especially a beautiful woman\u2019s words. He still lacks experience ah.\u201cFurthermore, as I have already said, I used my most precious Blood Clotting Cream to help your injury so you should no longer press on about me offending you.\u201d Kai Yang attempted to disperse her ideas of wanting to hurt him.\u201cIs one bottle of Blood Clotting Cream able to compensate my losses? You have\u2026\u2026.\u201d Hu Jiao Er\u2019s words couldn\u2019t come out. Previously she wanted to say that he had already hugged her, already touched her, but as the words were about to come out, some invisible force prevented them. Her losses were great, so could one bottle of cream for external injuries be able to make up for it?\u201cI can\u2019t help you, no matter what you say. As a matter of fact, you should already know that those things only happened because you initiated them.\u201dThose words only served to pour oil onto the fire, causing Hu Jiao Er to become both shy and angry. Just as she was about to attack, she turned around to look over at the place where Hu Mei Er was hidden. Seeing her energetic attempts to shout something, her heart softened and her anger gradually melted away. Taking in a deep breath she said: \u201cNevermind, this time I won\u2019t trouble you about it anymore.\u201dKai Yang couldn\u2019t help but exhale one long breath: \u201cLady, thank you for your pardon.\u201dHu Jiao Er lightly laughed: \u201cActually your words were correct, but there was one mistake.\u201d\u201cWhich part?\u201d Kai Yang asked.Hu Jiao Er didn\u2019t swiftly reply, but instead waved her hand making the hidden Hu Mei Er re-appear. Kai Yang was greatly shocked, because although he knew this woman\u2019s strength was high, he didn\u2019t think that her strength was at such a level. To wave your hands and have a person appear, clearly demonstrates that one is at the True Element Boundary.Obtaining her freedom, Hu Mei Er looked at Kai Yang with her charming eyes. Her face relaxed, just then she was nervous to death, afraid that her sister in a moment\u2019s fury would go and kill Kai Yang.When she looked over at her elder sister again, she couldn\u2019t help but laugh as she remembered Kai Yang\u2019s words.My god, there were still men who dared to say those words to her elder sister. And when he had said those words, he had suffered no loss.\u201cOlder sister!\u201d As soon as Hu Mei Er came out, she jumped onto her older sister and threw a tantrum: \u201cDon\u2019t be angry. This affair cannot be blamed on him.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say I would blame him.\u201d Hu Jiao Er\u2019s gloominess disappeared, and she turned her head around to face Kai Yang: \u201cThe point that you were wrong about is, Mei Er and I are not twins.\u201d\u201cYou are not twins?\u201d Surprised Kai Yang was.Looking carefully, the two ladies in front of him looked exactly the same, with no distinguishable difference. If they were to meet again and asked him who was who, he definitely would not be able to say.\u201cNo, I am older than Mei Er by a few years.\u201d Hu Jiao Er faintly smiled. When she saw Kai Yang\u2019s shock, her heart became somewhat more balanced and at peace.\u201cIt really is a vast world, full of extraordinary things.\u201d Kai Yang sighed out sorrowfully, they really were two sisters. They were born a few years apart, yet they looked so similar. Under the wide sky, perhaps this was the only case.\u201cYou don\u2019t know me?\u201d Hu Jiao Er was slightly puzzled, she was afterall a powerful younger generation disciple of Blood Group. Her reputation was widely celebrated, so how could this person not know of her?\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Kai Yang shook his head, appearing ignorant and inexperienced.Seeing that he wasn\u2019t lying, Hu Jiao Er could only believe him. She didn\u2019t know his daily experiences these past few years, he was practically living separately from the outside world, never socialising with others.\u201cYou have something you wish to trouble me with today?\u201d Hu Mei Er turned her head around to look at Kai Yang.Kai Yang then proceeded to tell them his goal. Hu Mei Er looked over to her older sister, asking for consultation. Her sister waved her hand and said: \u201cGo then, but don\u2019t cause a fuss at the mines.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Kai Yang let out a sigh of relief.\u201cLet\u2019s go. The mining area isn\u2019t that far from here.\u201d Hu Mei Er\u2019s mood appeared quite good, there was a rosy luster on her cheeks while she led the way.After Kai Yang and Hu Mei Er left, Hu Jiao Er stood up, and used her jade hands to slowly rub her soft, round and well-proportioned buttocks. As she massaged them, she muttered to herself: \u201cHow is one bigger than the other. They are clearly the same! That stinking brat, was clearly speaking nonsense. Too hateful.\u201dp.s. WAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! Ooh damn, your comments kept me laughing and quite entertained the entire day! \ud83d\ude09 How did you like my little prank? I was literally checking every couple of hours or so to see what new comments have been added and laugh some more. Too funny, I knew that would spawn many pseudo heart attacks, but I couldn't help it. And what do you mean about mischievousness? I'm not like that at all. Nope, I'm not. Ke ke ke, I don't plan on stopping translations so don't worry about them. Well first regular chapter of the week enjoy~! \ud83d\ude1bPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 \u2013 The mining sitePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 59 \u2013 The mining siteAfter leaving the bustling Black Wind Trade area, under Hu Mei Er\u2019s guidance, the two people walked towards the north side of the Black Wind Forest. Hu Mei Er looked very happy and within her pair of charming eyes you could glimpse signs of happiness, she also had slightly flushed cheeks.\u201cThat day\u2019s affair, I am sorry!\u201d Kai Yang suddenly apologised. His actions that day were really over the top and now that he had come to ask her for help, he felt a bit two faced.Hu Mei Er pursed her lips before smiling: \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Also, you didn\u2019t curse me or anything. These few years, I have heard even worse words and I\u2019m still living well aren\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t hate me?\u201d Kai Yang asked astonished.\u201cWhat\u2019s the use in hating you?\u201d Hu Mei Er smiled and suddenly said: \u201cActually I hated you quite a bit but\u2026\u2026\u2026one of your actions made me unable to hate you.\u201d\u201cWhat action?\u201d\u201cHe he, that day when Cheng Shao Feng and Niu Tao appeared, you went and stood in front of me. Perhaps that was a subconscious action, but these past few years, that was the first time someone sincerely and with all their heart wanted to protect me.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t remember it, but you must have suffered quite a lot.\u201d Kai Yang sighed. A perfectly good female, intentionally sullied their own reputation in order to find some talented disciples for the Blood Group. Although the methods were good, it still contained filial piety within.\u201cGe ge\u2026..\u201d Hu Mei Er smiled: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t too hard ah. Don\u2019t you know that putting on a show or act is a women\u2019s speciality. \u201d\u201cHe he, I have never interacted with women.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Hu Mei Er\u2019s eyes brightened.\u201cEn, so these past few days I have been exhausted and toyed around with thoroughly by you two sisters.\u201d Kai Yang said seriously.A streak of anger flashed in Hu MeI Er\u2019s eyes as she said: \u201cWhat you said is too bad! Fortunately sister\u2019s not here, otherwise you would be guaranteed a beating from her!\u201d\u201cYour sister\u2026..\u201d\u201cTrue element first boundary!\u201d Hu Mei Er said with some pride.\u201cStrong!\u201d He praised.Su Yan was at the true element third boundary, Hu Mei Er\u2019s sister was slightly weaker than Su Yan, but nonetheless it wasn\u2019t a big difference.As soon as Hu Mei Er mentioned her sister, she thought about what Kai Yang had said again, causing her to throw her head back in laughter. During this flurry of actions she didn\u2019t stop laughing.Kai Yang remained silent and stood in place waiting for her to recover her breath.After laughing for a good while, Hu Mei Er finally recovered her breath and turned to him with a big smile: \u201cI see that you have great courage. There has never been a man who dared to speak to my older sister like that. Her that place\u2026\u2026is it true that one is bigger than the other?\u201d\u201cIt could be because of the clothes she was wearing, so you can tell her later not to worry about it.\u201d Kai Yang gently laughed.\u201cThen how about mine? Is it really well portioned?\u201d Her face bashful, Hu Mei Er Er asked boldly.\u201cNot only are they well portioned, they stick out smoothly and are well rounded.\u201d Kai Yang nodded his head, \u201cYou body figure is very good, so you have no need to sell yourself short.\u201dFor a moment, Hu Mei Er thought it was a bit hard to bear. These frank and motiveless praises were the best words she had heard in a long time.At that moment, she was secretly happy inside.\u201cHow much longer will it take until we arrive?\u201d Kai Yang didn\u2019t want to continue discussing this topic, so he asked this question.\u201cThere is still one hour\u2019s worth of walking and although that place can be considered a part of Black Wind Forest, it is closer to the heart of the forest.\u201d Hu Mei Er explained: \u201cOver there, there is a vein that our Blood Group discovered a few years back. We sent over people to protect it and extract ores, the ores that are extracted from there are quite peculiar.\u201d\u201cHow are they peculiar?\u201d Kai Yang asked.\u201cOver there, there are only stones of two attributes. One of them is the stone you had bought, the Bright Yang Stone while the other is the Bright Yin Stone. If you say it is peculiar, it is not but these two stones mutually suppress each other. So to find them appearing together is quite a mystery.\u201d\u201cThat is really strange.\u201d Kai Yang\u2019s interest was slightly piqued.The Bright Yang Stone contained Yang attributed energy while the Bright Yin Stone contained Yin attributed energy, they were opposing attributes. Under normal circumstances, they definitely would not form together.\u201cEven the elders in the group feel that something isn\u2019t right with the mining vein, but even after years of investigation, they have yet to find anything out of the ordinary. Though, from this mine we have earned no small amount of money.\u201d Hu Mei Er didn\u2019t seem to treat Kai Yang like an outsider and whatever she thought, she would say.\u201cThis is your Blood Group\u2019s good fortune!\u201d Kai Yang chuckled.Hu Mei Er replied with an en and then suddenly lapsed into a reign of silence before speaking again: \u201cActually it is such a coincidence that you wanted to find me today. If it was at a later date then you probably wouldn\u2019t be able to find me. So it should be your good fortune.\u201d\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Kai Yang understood the underlying hint in her words.\u201cIt\u2019s not going somewhere.\u201d Hu Mei Er shook her head and as she explained, she secretly observed Kai Yang\u2019s expression: \u201cAfter your words last time, I suddenly thought that my actions these past years weren\u2019t correct. When utilizing those underhanded methods, the roped in talents don\u2019t care about the Blood Group, but rather only me! And since I cannot provide them with what they really want, naturally they won\u2019t try their best for the sect. That's why I have decided to go into seclusion to train and become stronger so I can shoulder some of the burdens with my daddy; just like my sister!\u201d\u201cThe fact that you can think like this, is a good thing.\u201d Kai Yang nodded his head in approval.Not only was Hu Mei Er disappointed by his response she also saw that from the beginning till the end, Kai Yang\u2019s face didn\u2019t change much at all. Her words caused no fluctuations in his mood.A bit pained and agonised, Hu Mei Er didn\u2019t have mood to continue talking and only led the way at the front.Since she didn\u2019t speak, Kai Yang naturally wouldn\u2019t go find something to talk to her about. After walking for another hour, the two people arrived at the mining site of the Blood Group.It was positioned at the centre of Black Wind Forest. An area of roughly twenty li was the size of the Blood Group\u2019s mining area. In the surrounding area, a few houses had been erected to allow the disciples to rest.Because the ore vein was underground, when Kai Yang and Hu Mei Er arrived, they didn\u2019t see many people and instead saw several large holes in the ground that lead underground.Apart from the surrounding hundred feet or so, Kai Yang felt a weak reaction from his Origin of Yang in the center of his stomach area; a reaction to the underground Bright Yang Stones. Along with the growth of his strength the area in which he could sense Yang energy also grew larger, but it didn\u2019t increase by much.Seeing the two people entering the mining area, a Blood Group disciple took notice of them. Then an old man suddenly dropped down from the sky and landed in front of Kai Yang and Hu Mei Er. Cupping his hands he said: \u201cYoung lady!\u201d\u201cGrandpa Long.\u201d Hu Mei Er called out familiarly and pulled on Kai Yang to introduce him: \u201cThis is our sect\u2019s vice head, grandfather Long, Long Zai Tian.\u201dKai Yang hurriedly paid his respects: \u201cThis one meets the Long senior.\u201dLong Zai Tian looked at Kai Yang in contempt and didn\u2019t pay any regard to him. With his immortal ascension boundary cultivation, and position as vice head of the Blood Group, was there any need to pay regard to Kai Yang\u2019s little face?Not to mention a youngster who relied on a woman! Long Zai Tian especially despised people like Kai Yang, and if it wasn\u2019t for Hu Mei Er\u2019s face, he would have long since slapped Kai Yang to death.\u201cYoung lady, why did you come to the mining site?\u201d Stroking his long white beard, Long Zai Tian kindly asked her, \u201cIt is both dirty and hot here so how is this someplace you can come to. Hurry and return, otherwise when your father learns of it, he will scold me.\u201d\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t happen. Daddy wouldn\u2019t have the guts to scold you because you are the third most powerful elder in the sect, in fact he only respects you.\u201d Hu Mei Er used her ** spoilt child act, causing Long Zai Tian to become quite joyful.\u201cGrandpa Long, my friend here wants to purchase some things from some of the disciples here. Would you allow us to trouble you and enter to find them?\u201d Hu Mei Er asked, arriving at her goal.p.s. Mkai, so this is the first release for today. I will start to work on the second release later to make up for long span of silence. \ud83d\ude00 Also the new character Long Zai Tian, his name literally means \"Dragon in the Sky\". What a powerful name, but his actions are \u2026\u2026\u2026.-_- well you guys can see. While tl-ing this I stopped to read ATG and oh my god, Yun Che gonna crack some bones and pulverise some brats. WOOOOO. \ud83d\ude00 Until the second chapter release then.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

From his tone you tell he despised Kai Yang as he said: \u201cEven disciples of the sect aren\u2019t able to freely enter as they wish, let alone you, an outsider.\u201dAfter he finished saying this, his face became full of pain as he turned around to Hu Mei Er to say: \u201cYoung lady, how could you bring an outsider to this place? Since you are young, you don\u2019t know the ways of people\u2019s hearts, you may know a person for a long time but not their true nature. These past years, because of this mine, we have earned quite a lot of money, with many eyes secretly watching us making inquires, all wanting to exploit any weakness. If this old man did not guard the mine all year round, one couldn\u2019t possibly imagine the chaos that might ensue.\u201dKai Yang was deep in thought, this old timer was indirectly accusing him of spying. When you heard this spoken about yourself you really didn\u2019t feel well.Hu Mei Er sensed Kai Yang wasn\u2019t happy and hurriedly said: \u201cGrandpa Long you misunderstood. He doesn\u2019t enquire about anything, but only wants to purchase some things.\u201dLong Zai Tian mockingly laughed: \u201cPurchase some things? You need to come all the way here to buy things? This excuse is really interesting. Brat, I don\u2019t know what your goal is, but scram for his elder now. If you dare to come here again, let\u2019s see if this elder dares to kill you or not.\u201dA belly full of angry rose, Kai Yang felt this coarse senior was far too arrogant. But although he was resentful, he knew that the difference in strength was far too great and if moves were exchanged, Kai Yang was afraid he wouldn\u2019t even last one breath\u2019s time.Forcibly suppressing his anger, Kai Yang didn\u2019t say a word. If he was to start something, he would only disadvantage himself.\u201cCoward!\u201d As Long Zai Tian saw Kai Yang\u2019s reactions, he despised him even more.Uncontrollably the Yang World Qi within Kai Yang\u2019s daitan started to swell up, as he glowered at Long Zai Tian.Sensing the change in Kai Yang\u2019s World Qi, Long Zai Tian angrily said: \u201cImpudent! You want to attack me?\u201dOnce he finished, without any reason or regard to power seniority, a palm was sent out towards Kai Yang. Seeing this palm being sent towards him, Kai Yang stood there unable to move. It wasn\u2019t because he was scared stiff, but rather that the opponent had used some sort of skill to immobilize him.Kai Yang\u2019s face changed greatly because he would never have imagined that this old timer would be so shameless. He could feel Long Zai Tian\u2019s attitude towards him, but couldn\u2019t figure out the reason why and faced with this intent to kill, Kai Yang didn\u2019t know how to react.With death charging towards him, the immense pressure that accompanied an immortal ascension boundary practitioner\u2019s attack caused even Kai Yang\u2019s heart to freeze. His breathing also became shallow, meanwhile an instinctual desire for survival arose from within his body.Suddenly from within his bones, a boiling hot warmth seeped out and rapidly spread throughout his body. The next moment, Kai Yang felt the restricting forces on his body disappear.Hastily, Kai Yang used all of his strength to dodge to the side.Long Zai Tian causally smashed down his palm, he thought that he would definitely have hit that Sky Tower disciple with his palm. Contrary to his predictions, the opposite party had actually dodged!How could that be? Long Zai Tian\u2019s eyebrows creased.How could his immortal ascension boundary restricting techniques be broken by this youngster? Because he didn\u2019t predict this, Long Zai Tian had just casually slammed his palm down.Although Long Zai Tian\u2019s attack did not hit Kai Yang, it put him in a difficult position. His face became pale and he was left sweating all over while he stabilised his position, he looked at Long Zai Tian for a while. Within Kai Yang\u2019s eyes, there was an extra streak of coldness.If one said that Kai Yang had annoyed over Long Zai Tian\u2019s attitude towards him, you could now say that he was furious. The opponent tried to take his life without even trying to hide his intent, like he was toying with an ant.Although Long Zai Tian also knew this point, he still didn\u2019t know how Kai Yang had escaped his binding. But since he had shown that he wanted to kill Kai Yang, how could he be light with his strikes? One step to strike, one step to rest, as he prepared to send another strike over.Only now did Hu Mei Er regain her senses, she quickly rushed in front of Kai Yang while she glaring at Long Zai Tian. Hissing out: \u201cGrandpa Long, he is my friend! What are you trying to do?\u201d\u201cFor people trying to make inquires about the mine, all must die, as decreed by the law! This the command of the Sect Head!\u201d Long Zai Tian looked at Hu Mei Er deeply, while a flash of astonishment appeared in his eyes.Before, Hu Mei Er would often have dealings with young males, but he had never seen her disregard her life for anyone. With regards to the life and deaths of those young males, Hu Mei Er never cared about them. In other words, eight out of ten of those youngsters, none had good endings.But this time, she was undaunted by the dangers stood infront of this Sky Tower disciple while also using quite a fierce tone to question him.This had never happened before! Long Zai Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed, thinking it over, his killing intent became stronger.Hu Mei Er protected Kai Yang behind her, clenching her teeth she glowered at Long Zai Tian and said: \u201cI said, he only wants to purchase some things and doesn\u2019t want to inquire about the mine! Grandpa Long, do you not understand my words?\u201dSeeing how Hu Mei Er wanted to protect Kai Yang, Long Zai Tian could no longer continue to be a troublemaker and could only say: \u201cDon\u2019t dare. Young lady\u2019s words, this elder still believes them.\u201d\u201cSince it is so, why do you still act that way?\u201d\u201cThis elder admits his mistakes, and asks for the forgiveness of the young lady.\u201dThe Blood Group, Strom House and Sky Tower were all different, the Blood Group was a family group. The Hu family were the masters, so although Long Zai Tian was the Vice-Head, he must still give Hu Mei Er face.\u201cBut this elder still asks for the young lady\u2019s forgiveness because the mine is no small matter and outsiders cannot enter!\u201d After speaking, Long Zai Tian didn\u2019t look to Hu Mei Er but turned towards Kai Yang\u2019s direction, he snorted out coldly and turned around to leave.Kai Yang took in a deep breath, calming the boiling blood within him to say: \u201cNo need for senior to see me out!\u201dLong Zai Tian impatiently turned his head and narrowed his eyes at Kai Yang, hiding away traces of killing intent in his eyes.\u201cSenior, the present me is not your opponent!\u201d Kai Yang slowly walked in front of Hu Mu Er and without any fear he faced Long Zai Tian, \u201cSo today\u2019s affairs, I will remember them. But after five years, ten years, I will come and return this debt. I hope that senior will be able to live till that day!\u201dKai Yang spoke with great serenity, but with seriousness.Long Zai Tian\u2019s face became cold, before he started to laugh out loud: \u201cWhether or not this senior would be able to live to that day, you don\u2019t need to worry about. But I think you definitely won\u2019t be able to live till that day! Unbridled youngster, please be careful in the future!\u201d\u201cI will!\u201dAfter Long Zai Tian departed, Hu Mei Er apologised profusely to Kai Yang: \u201cI am very sorry, I am very sorry. I don\u2019t know why grandpa Long would act this way and if I had known earlier, I wouldn\u2019t have brought you over.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Kai Yang breathed in deeply, recalling the immensely terrifying scene, he still felt some lingering fear. If it wasn't for the golden skeleton\u2019s actions at that crucial moment, he was afraid that he would be long dead. It was that boiling hot warmth that allowed him to break free of Long Zai Tian\u2019s bindings and escape mortal danger.p.s. WOOO! Second release of the day and I set a new record! Pushed through and without any distractions, finished it in around 1 hour. Yep, 1 hour, way shorter than my usual 2-3 hours (because of distractions). Happy new Year guys!!! It's only less than two hours away from midnight, so an early wishing because I won't be posting at 12. Still debating on whether or not to stay until 12 to watch the fireworks\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.will decide later. What are you guys doing for the new year? Family gathering?

    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 \u2013 I owe you a favourPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 61 \u2013 I owe you a favourWhy would Long Zai Tian go against him? Kai Yang took a glance at the forlorn and ashamed Hu Mei Er, the reason became clear.Some things were better left unsaid.Hu Mei Er was also a bright and intelligent girl, and although Kai Yang only glanced at her, she still understood the reason for his gaze.\u201cGrandpa forbade you from entering the mine, and I am unable to not give him face. How about this, I will go and buy those seeds in your place and you wait for me here.\u201d Hu Mei Er suggested.\u201cOkay.\u201d Kai Yang knew this was the only way, and immediately went to give all of his valuable possessions to her before telling her the names of the disciple who possessed the seeds. That time in the Black Wind Trade area, he had gotten all the relevant information from the booth owner.Hu Mei Er entered the underground mine, while Kai Yang\u2019s eyes swept over the holes in the ground. When Long Zai Tian had left, he had entered one of the houses, and Kai Yang could sense that within that house a pair of eyes were staring at him intently.Inside the house, a pair of eyes were currently fixed on Kai Yang\u2019s position.He had watched when Long Zai Tian had struck out at Kai Yang earlier, he was about the same age as Kai Yang. He was Long Zai Tian\u2019s grandson, Long Hui!Long Hui was currently looking at Kai Yang coldly and said somewhat discontentedly: \u201cGrandpa, why didn\u2019t you kill him back then?\u201dLong Zai Tian laughed coldly: \u201cWith Mei Er\u2019s protection, how do you expect me to kill him?\u201d\u201cAll the more reason to kill him. I have never seen little sister Hu Mei Er spend so much effort for any man and that youngster\u2019s relationship with Mei Er isn\u2019t shallow. To allow him to live, will only cause problems.\u201d\u201cEn, we have never seen Hu Mei Er protect someone like that. And for him, she actually dared to go against me, which is very unusual.\u201d Long Zai Tian\u2019s eyebrows creased.Long Hui was extremely jealous: \u201cNow that Mei Er has entered the mine, how about grandpa attacks again?\u201dLong Zai Tian looked at Long Hui resentfully, he wanted to comply: \u201cThere is no problem with me attacking him, to kill him is no hard task. But, if because of his death, it causes Mei Er to harbour resentment towards you, do you think it is worth it?\u201dLong Hui looked on blankly before shaking his head: \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it, but are we really going to allow him to continue his relationship with Hu Mei Er? I can\u2019t bear it.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Long Zai Tian couldn\u2019t help but let out a breath, \u201cLearn more from your older brother and see how he treats the women that he likes. If you want Mei Er, you must use more of your mind. Grandpa can help you kill people, but I can\u2019t possibly help you acquire a female's heart right? Hu Man does not have any sons, only Jiao Er and Mei Er these two daughters, so if you and your older brother able to obtain these two, then in the future, the Blood Group would belong to my Long family! In all three generations of my Long family, we have put decades of work into helping Blood Group so we deserve the taste of being the sect head!\u201dHearing this caused Long Hui to become hot-blooded as he nodded his head: \u201cIt should be time for my Long family to become the master family. Relax grandpa, Mei Er won\u2019t be able to escape and over on big brother\u2019s side, Hu Jiao Er will definitely be captured.\u201d\u201cEn, seeing that you have resolve is good.\u201d Long Zai Tian smiled at him.Long Hui was full of venom, he blamed things on the distant Kai Yang. With a bit of restlessness he said: \u201cGrandpa, that person\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou go find the opportunity yourself. His strength isn\u2019t high, so you should be able to cope.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Long Hui laughed sinisterly.Although he couldn\u2019t do anything now since Hu Mei Er would return shortly, Kai Yang was still a Sky Tower disciple, so he wouldn\u2019t be able to run far.Kai Yang waited outside for a short while before Hu Mei Er came out, sweating all over. Her face full of smiles, she stuffed fours seeds into Kai Yang\u2019s hands: \u201cFortunately it wasn\u2019t life threatening.\u201dThe young lady of the Blood Group wanted to purchase some things, so which disciple dared to not sell?\u201cMany thanks!\u201d Kai Yang very carefully placed the four seeds within his chest area pocket.After standing in his original position for a while, Kai Yang struggled before saying: \u201cYou have helped me this time, I owe you a favor.\u201dHu Mei Er looked at Kai Yang strangely: \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dWaving his hand, Kai Yang said: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you follow me!\u201dAlthough Hu Mei Er didn\u2019t know what he wanted to do, she obediently followed him over.After walking about thirty feet, Kai Yang unexpectedly stopped and stamped his foot: \u201cI want you to remember this place. About seventy feet below here, there should be some unusual things.\u201dHu Mei Er eyes widened in doubt: \u201cHow do you know?\u201dKai Yang muttered a bit indistinctly: \u201cThe martial skill that I am practising, within a certain distance, I can sense all Yang attributed things. Underneath here there should be a Yang attributed treasure and its Yang energy fluctuations are many times more pure than the Bright Yang Stones.\u201dBefore coming here, Kai Yang had already sensed that in this area was a bit unusual and after considering it, he decided to tell Hu Mei Er. One reason was, due the this area belonging to the Blood Group, even if Kai Yang wanted these treasures, he couldn\u2019t obtain them. Secondly, he still owed Hu Mei Er a favour and Kai Yang saw everything she did as she helped him today.\u201cAh?\u201d Hearing Kai Yang\u2019s words, Hu Mei Er became frightened.\u201cDo you believe me?\u201d\u201cI believe!\u201d Hu Mei Er replied very frankly, making Kai Yang feel a bit moved.\u201cThat\u2019s good then.\u201d Smiling lightly: \u201cEven though I do not know what is below, its value definitely isn\u2019t low. Also, apart from that, there seems to be something else too, for the specifics, I can\u2019t sense it. But from my guesses, the secret hidden below should be the peculiar mystery that your Blood Group has been trying solve regarding the mine. It\u2019s extremely possible it\u2019s because of their existence, that this ore vein exists.\u201dHu Mei Er couldn\u2019t help but be moved. If what Kai Yang said was true, then the secret hidden underneath was extremely important.\u201cYou are an intelligent girl, so you should know how to act.\u201d Kai Yang solemnly urged her.\u201cI understand.\u201d Hu Mei Er kept on nodding her head.\u201cOkay then, let\u2019s go.\u201d He smiled as he said this.\u201cEn.\u201dWalking through the forest, Hu Mei Er and Kai Yang didn\u2019t speak, but instead enjoyed the warmth of the forest together.Hu Mei Er was extremely joyful because Kai Yang had told her such important information. It was evident that his impression of her had changed greatly, unlike last time when he had simply disregarded her and ordered her around.This time was different, he was much gentler and softer with her.\u201cWe shall part here.\u201d Abruptly, Kai Yang stopped his steps, while Hu Mei Er looked distracted, showing her unwillingness. In the blink of an eye, the two people had arrived at the four way intersection; time passed by so quickly! Hu Mei Er was grieving slightly.\u201cGoodbye.\u201d Kai Yang hurriedly said this and rushed back to Sky Tower Pavilion.He really isn\u2019t an easily swayed man! Hu Mei Er laughed out bitterly, trying to cope.p.s. Happy New Years guys, since today is officially 1/01/2016 for me, not to mention this is the first chapter release of the year. Last year I release 60, this I definitely will release at least twice the amount, probably more. Also, I took a sneak peak at the next chapter title and decided it a good spoiler~ Chapter 62 \u2013 Xia Ning Chang's decision. Hmm??? I wonder decision our beloved Xia Ning is going to make next chapter? Possibly regarding Kai Yang? XDPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 \u2013 Xia Ning Chang\u2019s decisionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 62 \u2013 Xia Ning Chang\u2019s decisionNext to Coiling Dragon Stream, Kai Yang concentrated on his training.Not too far from him there were three Three Sun\u2019s Fruit trees growing healthily, the biggest of the three already had three fruits growing, all on the verge of ripening. The smallest of the three had only just emerged from the ground, it was still a tiny sapling.Ever since the day he had left the Blood Group mine, Kai Yang had been cultivating non-stop day and night at the Coiling Dragon Stream; even forgetting to eat. Long Zai Tian\u2019s capricious attacks had motivated him to become stronger. With regards to that event he wanted to extract revenge with his own two hands.After ten days of training, he had reached the peak of the tempered body ninth stage and was on the brink of breaking through. But he seemed to be unable to grasp certain key points, causing Kai Yang to feel hopeless.He knew that a realm breakthrough required an opportunity, and wasn\u2019t easy like breaking through the various sub-stages. Even if he has enough World Qi, he must have a chance encounter and understand what needs to be understood.But if you thought about it, these days of training went by quite smoothly. He no longer needed to go and sweep, so he had more hours to train, the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass herbs had long since been finished. Without the incense\u2019s pressure, the results from activating the True Yang Tactics were clearly faster, allowing Kai Yang to absorb the Yang Qi more easily from the earth.But all of the Yang Liquid drops that had been condensed, were used as a catalysts to transform the Three Sun\u2019s Fruit seeds. Within his dantian, not single drop remained.The word\u2019s essence congregated around Kai Yang who was about to break into the initial element stage and filled his body with new energy, but unfortunately Kai Yang didn\u2019t succeed.Even after a day and night, Kai Yang was still stuck at this bottleneck. Although he didn\u2019t feel worried, or impatient, he was unable to free himself of the shackles that bound him; it was so very strange.Another night came, under the starry sky, next to Coiling Dragon Stream, Kai Yang sank into an anxious type of mood. All of his World Qi seemed to become chaotic and on his face, an extremely painful expression appeared.Not too far away, Xia Ning Chang who was watching Kai Yang couldn\u2019t help but cry out. Though they were quite a distance apart, she could still sense the unusual World Qi fluctuations; within those World Qi fluctuations, there was a cold and evil Qi.How could it be like this? This was a clear sign of walking into the dark practises. He was only breaking into the initial element stage from the tempered body ninth stage, so how could there be a chance of accidentally walking into the dark practises?Saying it badly, a martial practitioner like Kai Yang with such a low level of cultivation didn\u2019t even have the qualifications for dark practises. Only when he was at a higher stage, would he have a chance to start to cultivate in that direction.But this situation was actually occurring to Kai Yang.Xia Ning Chang\u2019s pretty eyebrows furrowed together in confusion.The reason why she was there was because she had searched for Kai Yang. She had watched over Kai Yang for more than two years, so it had become a habit. These recent few days, with the sudden disappearance of Kai Yang, had left her a bit lonely and everything she did, wasn\u2019t interesting. Searching for him, she had found him next to Coiling Dragon Stream and the big stone in her heart had been lifted.After arriving, Xia Ning Chang knew that Kai Yang was about to breakthrough. After waiting for a day, Kai Yang had unexpectedly not, and now this strange thing had arisen, so how could she not be in doubt.Just as Xia Ning Chang was feeling anxious inside, a pure and blistering hot energy burst from within Kai Yang. With that blistering hot energy's appearance, the demonic traces of energy were gradually being burnt away and Kai Yang\u2019s World Qi fluctuations immediately became steady.\u201cTrue Yang Energy!\u201d Xia Ning Chang\u2019s small mouth gaped open and her charming face displayed her amazement. Nearly crying out, \u201cHow could it be so pure!\u201dThat pure and blistering hot energy, was clearly Yang type energy. Many Sky Tower disciples cultivate fire or Yang type martial skills and possessed this type of fiery World Qi. But no matter which disciples World Qi was compared with Kai Yang's, it wouldn\u2019t be as pure as his.This blistering hot energy wasn\u2019t very dense, because Kai Yang\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t very high. But it was abnormally clean, without the tiniest bit of impurity; like a water source that hadn\u2019t been contaminated by the outside world.Before she could recover herself, Xia Ning Chang saw that the demonic energy which was being suppressed by that blistering energy was also being replaced by it while it scattered inside Kai Yang.After a short while, another burst true Yang qi came out from Kai Yang and suppressed the remaining dark energy, restoring Kai Yang.This repeated a few times, leaving Xia Ning Chang dumbstruck! She had never seen or heard of such a bizarre occurrence when a martial practitioner broke through into the initial element stage.In other words, although breaking through to the initial element stage one would suffer some restrictions, because the stage was still fairly low so were the restrictions. As long as one used some effort they could break through, but this was not the case for Kai Yang. She could clearly see that the restrictions he suffered were far greater than anyone else\u2019s, and were in fact comparable to those she suffered when she was breaking into the higher stages.Kai Yang was currently suffering bitterly, but just then he had pried into the next stage a little bit. He already had a foot into the initial element stage, but at that moment from within his bones came out a evil energy causing him to lose his concentration. Fortunately his Yang World Qi allowed him to clear his mind.Currently inside his body, the two energies were fighting a ferocious battle with one being the Yang energy that he cultivated and other one being the evil energy that came from his bones. Each side struggled endlessly, treating his body like their battlefield. The evil energy occupied the upper part of his body, making his mind a bit muddled and elicited bloodthirsty emotions from within his mind. He wanted to go find a person to kill.This was similar to when he was injured by others during a battle, while also being different. Although when he was injured he felt bloodthirsty during battle, his mind was still clear.While his Yang World Qi occupied the lower part of his body, leaving his body extremely clear and free.Circling around without end, leaving one unable to determine a clear winner and loser.Kai Yang felt most uncomfortable.Xia Ning Chang dashed around Sky Tower wearing her tight, black clothes displaying her wonderful figure. A slender waist, with long slim legs that made people lose themselves in their fantasies. With an uneasy feeling and a black veil covering her face, she rushed over to Kai Yang.She had watched from her position for quite a long time, and felt really concerned for Kai Yang. Thinking it over numerous times, she still decided to go over and help him. Usually, when someone was breaking through, they could not be disturbed, but Xia Ning Chang could clearly feel the chaotic battle occurring inside Kai Yang! It was like a bloodthirst for battle type of baptism.Only a battle could help relieve him, only that could help him escape from that endless cycle.That\u2019s why Xia Ning Chang returned to her residence to change her clothes before going to him, otherwise he might be able to recognise her. Afterall, they had met face to face before.Returning back hurriedly, Kai Yang was still suffering and his movements seemed to be bigger than before.Without the slightest bit of hesitation, Xia Ning Chang directly pounced onto Kai Yang. Murderous intent shone in her charming eyes, her hand attacked.p.s. Have to be honest, that wassn't what I expected but it was pretty good. I mean you can tell that XNC has started to fall in love with Kai Yang. XD When I she pounced on him I seriously had started to have second thoughts on her, but that ruthlessly attack\u2026\u2026.-_- all I can say is, \"Poor KY\".Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 \u2013 You seem like my senior sisterPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 63 \u2013 You seem like my senior sisterSince she had already decided to help him, Xia Ning Chang didn\u2019t want to expose herself and show any flaws. Only once she helped, by fighting Kai Yang, would he be able to breakthrough.That\u2019s why her first strike was infused with killing intent.Kai Yang\u2019s strength was only at the tempered body ninth stage, so Xia Ning Chang only used strength that was around the initial element second-third realm.Kai Yang who was at a critical juncture sensed something amiss, and felt a cold pressure around him. Without ample time to react, he felt that he was in a life or death situation.Just as he was in doubt about this sense, the sound of a palm came from the side of his body.Someone had launched a sneak attack against him! Kai Yang immediately woke up, he wasn\u2019t scared, rather he was happy as he leapt to the side. Creasing his eyebrows, he swiftly threw out a fist.His fighting spirit had been woken when he was trying to break through and just as he was pondering how to discharge the energy in his body, who would have imagined that somebody would come and present themselves like that! As to who had come to mount this sneak attack on him, Kai Yang no longer cared because he only wanted to fight, to fight a fulfilling battle!Hearing the enemy's sounds and the beating of their World Qi, Kai Yang hastily retreated a few steps. Xia Ning Chang\u2019s attack hit empty space so she calmly slowed her pace, while a flash of surprise went through her eyes.Even though she had only used strength at about the initial element third stage, it wasn\u2019t a even match for him. Her attack should have successfully landed.Retreating a bit, Kai Yang used the moonlight to view his opponent\u2019s build. It was a female, but her face was covered with a black veil so he was unable to see her face.\u201cHow could it be a girl!\u201d Kai Yang eyebrows wrinkled as he mumbled discontentedly.As soon as Xia Ning Chang heard those words, she was trembling with rage! Clenching her teeth, her body lightly flew over while World Qi gathered in the palm of her hand and covered with sky with images of her palm directed towards Kai Yang\u2019s head.Those words had angered her too much!Kai Yang howled out and released all of his strength along with his boiling hot Word Qi, matching up against Xia Ning Chang. Although the opponent was a female, Kai Yang wasn\u2019t lenient. Their strength was clearly higher than his by a level, whilst also containing killing intent, so he didn\u2019t dare to be careless.Lightning and fire intercrossed, both Kai Yang and Xia Ning Chang were tightly locked in battle but it was clear that it was unfavourable for Kai Yang. His style of combat was bursts of heavy strength, and although his killing power was ferocious, it couldn\u2019t match up with Xia Ning Chang\u2019s nimbleness. If he attacked twice, Xia Ning Chang would attack three times, coupled with Xia Ning Chang\u2019s agile movements that allowed her to move in all directions it was like a monkey was playing tricks on Kai Yang.Kai Yang was beaten all over, making him furious! He could sense that this opponent\u2019s strength was higher than his by quite a bit, but he would have never guessed that his opponent was hiding her true power while fighting him. Fighting these types of opponents, to manage to land a hit on them would actually be a miracle.Face blackened, Xia Ning Chang who was seething with rage was suddenly smiling. She thought: \u2018Who told you to spout nonsense. You deserve to be beaten black and blue!\u2019(TL: Women be Scaryyyyy)It was just in a few moments, the aches and sores that Kai Yang had received, awoke his blood\u2019s excitement. Energy surging like a gushing river, he listened carefully; he could even hear the waves crashing down, as the familiar warmth spread throughout his body while his strength gradually returned.Xia Ning Chang repeatedly showed signs of shock, because she sensed that this junior brother\u2019s World Qi undulations were getting bigger and bigger as his strength gradually started to breakthrough from the tempered body stage to arrive at the initial element stage. Not mention that it had yet to stop and was slowly but steadily still increasing.The fist that carried with it a hot Word Qi became bigger and stronger, bigger and heavier. Xia Ning Chang started to feel that she could not hold on, so she increased her strength a bit more and clenched her teeth whilst enduring.\u201cWho made you come and try to kill me?\u201d In the middle of this fierce battle, Kai Yang suddenly asked her with a gloomy face, his voice was deep and tinged with dispiritedness.Xia Ning Chang didn\u2019t answer and instead used all her focus to repel Kai Yang\u2019s moves.Up until now, Kai Yang\u2019s strength would just match up with hers without either side having the slightest bit of an advantage. As long as she was targeted by his fist, she had to use some effort to repel the pure Yang Qi that invaded her body.Xia Ning Chang was quite fearful and was afraid she had underestimated this pure Yang World Qi\u2019s might. This level of pureness was not something an ordinary martial practitioner could reach.Just as Kai Yang and Xia Ning Chang\u2019s hands crossed again neither of them retreated.Narrowing his eyes at the opposing female, Kai Yang\u2019s gaze was pulled to her forehead and on it there was a faint imprint. Slightly startled, Kai Yang asked: \u201cYour appearance\u2026\u2026you seem like my senior sister!\u201dXia Ning Chang was currently defending against the invasion of Kai Yang\u2019s Yang Qi, so when she heard those words, it startled her. She thought: \u2018When was it exposed?\u2019 She never would have imagined it was the faint imprint on her forehead that aroused Kai Yang\u2019s suspicions.Kai Yang remembered Xia Ning Chang\u2019s forehead had a blue gemstone in the area of that imprint.Xia Ning Chang\u2019s eyes nervously blinked, her eyelashes quivered nonstop meanwhile Kai Yang grinned widely. It suddenly hindered her attacks, so he firmly pulled her into his embrace and tore off her veil.Up until that moment, Xia Ning Chang had only just recovered and wasn\u2019t willing to reveal who she was. Firstly, she wanted to increase the pressure on Kai Yang, and secondly, she was a bit embarrassed. After all, last time\u2019s meeting was far too awkward, so how could she possibly take off her veil?In a moment of desperation, she failed to suppress her strength so a ferocious burst of World Qi lashed out. Kiai Yang cried out strangely, and flew backwards quite a distance. When he landed, he continued to roll some more.When he managed to crawl up, how could that female still be there? She had long since escaped to god knows where.\u201cCould it really be?\u201d Just then, he had casually asked the question, but who would have thought she would react so badly. That final World Qi infused attack allowed Kai Yang to know of the great disparity in their strengths. If she truly wanted to kill him, it would be as simple as raising her hand. Was it really necessary for her to initiate a battle with him?Whether it was the case or not was no longer important, because under that battles stimulation, the shackles that bound him were broken. He immediately sat down and carefully started to sense the world energy.In the next hour, the worldly energy started to flow violently towards Kai Yang\u2019s direction.Breathing in deeply, all of Kai Yang\u2019s pores opened and gladly absorbed the world energy into his body. The pulled in world energy started to roam around Kai Yang\u2019s body and cleansed his entire body.This was an opportunity given to every martial practitioner that broke through to a higher realm. As for the results of the cleansing, it depended on how much effort a practitioner put into it.A hundred feet away, Xia Ning Chang panickedly hugged her chest because she didn\u2019t think that Kai Yang would recognise her. Though she had finally helped him breakthrough, so she hadn\u2019t wasted her efforts.Just as she was panicking, a person\u2019s figure appeared. A simply dressed old man suddenly appeared. This old man was completely white with a friendly appearance.(TL: Eleventh elder!!!)After she saw his face, Xia Ning Chang respectfully greeted him: \u201cGreetings to the sect head.\u201dThe old man kindly smiled: \u201cYou are not one of my Sky Tower disciples, no need for the formalities.\u201dXia Ning Chang softly said: \u201cBut you are a close friend of my master, so naturally you are my senior.\u201dp.s. Hey hey hey, well then XNC is quite adorable. Personally I'm in the XNC faction, not really the Hu sister faction mainly because of some spoilers I read on Baidu, but yeah.

    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 \u2013 Initial Element StagePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 64 \u2013 Initial Element StageWhen the Sect Head saw Xia Ning Chang\u2019s clever and sensible behaviour, he couldn\u2019t help but smile: \u201cMeng Wu Ya really has good fortune to have accepted such a well-behaved disciple.\u201dRecalling his own two disciples, the Head secretly sighed.Xia Ning Chang was very clear on his past, and seeing his expression dim, she didn\u2019t know how to comfort him. She could only sink into silence.Without speaking, the Head raised his hand to the sky and then pushed in the direction of Kai Yang. In that moment, Xia Ning Chang felt that the heaven and earth in that area had been sliced in half; like a enormous invisible palm was shielding that area from all prying eyes.\u201cThis youngster\u2019s breakthrough should have caused quite the ruckus, so it would be best to hide this first. This is to avoid investigation by others.\u201d The Head started to explain.Xia Ning Chang was at a loss. Why was this head who often did not show himself to others all year round, treating Kai Yang with such interest. But although she was puzzled, she didn\u2019t dare to ask.One old, one young, remained at this one hundred foot distance as they watched over Kai Yang\u2019s situation.The world energy entered the tempered body staged body of Kai Yang and spread through every inch of it. Even though one could not sense the initial element fluctuations, they could see that in a ten foot radius, a large gale of wind was circulating with Kai Yang as the origin, the commotion around Kai Yang really wasn\u2019t small.This was only a breakthrough into the initial element stage, so how could it be like this? Xia Ning Chang really didn\u2019t understand it.With the passing of time, a drumming sound slowly began in Kai Yang\u2019s body. He felt his body was like a balloon expanding, because there was quite a large amount of world energy pouring in.Just as Xia Ning Chang was secretly worrying for him, his body reverted to how it was previously. Even under the Head\u2019s barrier, she could still feel the sinister World Qi fluctuations.What was even more shocking was that the immense amount of World Qi had been completely absorbed by Kai Yang. And unexpectedly, a blazing hot, red stream of energy came gushing out from Coiling Dragon Stream.These strips of energy were like red ribbons, rising from the bottom of Coiling Dragon Stream, they entered Kai Yang through his pores.Yang attributed Qi! Xia Ning Chang realised, the energy Kai Yang had previously absorbed was world energy, and this time it was Yang attributed Qi. Although it could still be considered world energy, it was energy with a single attribute.Only after this Yang attributed Qi had been completely absorbed by Kai Yang, did the commotion cease.\u201cNot bad.\u201d The Head smiled slightly, and snapped his fingers to remove the barrier he had erected. In a split second his figure had disappeared leaving only his voice near Xia Ning Chang\u2019s ear: \u201cPlease ask if your master is well in my place.\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201d Xia Ning Chang respectfully replied, before going to investigate the results of Kai Yang\u2019s breakthrough.With only one look, Xia Ning Chang was stunned.Initial element second stage!She actually thought she had sensed incorrectly, so she checked again and confirmed that Kai Yang really had reached the initial element second stage!His breakthrough this time had not only involved him breaking into a higher realm, but also breaking through one of the sub stages. Was she dreaming?Xia Ning Chang\u2019s own physique was special and even with her meticulous cultivating and training, when she broke through she didn\u2019t directly break through two stages. So today when she saw Kai Yang in front of her achieve this feat, how could she not be stunned?Just as she was staring at him flabbergasted, Kai Yang who was sitting down cross-legged suddenly muttered to himself: \u201cSo it was like this!\u201dThat being said, the World Qi fluctuations from his body became denser, he broke through to the initial element third stage!\u201cMonster!\u201d Xia Ning Chang didn\u2019t know how to react, as she once again felt a blow to her confidence.After holding her position for a while, and confirming that Kai Yang wouldn\u2019t increase in strength again, Xia Ning Chang finally let loose a sigh of relief, then left sorrowfully.Kai Yang sat next to Coiling Dragon Stream for the entire night, but didn\u2019t cultivate his True Yang Tactics at all, rather he set about understanding the insights he had gained during his breakthrough.During his breakthrough, two different types of energy had entered Kai Yang. One was the world energy, this had not been absorbed into his dantian, this had been absorbed by his bones, apart from a portion of tempered body energy.The second type was the Yang attributed energy from within the Coiling Dragon Stream which had fully become his. This energy had condensed into five drops of Yang Liquid and was calmly residing within his dantian. After thinking for the entire night, Kai Yang had finally achieved a vague understanding.The golden skeleton was able to sense when he sustained injuries or pain and restore his stamina, but this boost required energy to work. It could not come from nothing, so it absorbing world energy was not something hard to comprehend.The world energy absorbed by it this time, would be given back to him later when he needed the stamina boosts. This was also one of the golden skeleton\u2019s profound uses, and the reason why it could supplement his stamina when needed during battle.Kai Yang had also thought that he could only take in Yang type energy because he was cultivating the True Yang Tactics. But it looked like now, this theory ought to tested.If he really could absorb energy that wasn\u2019t Yang attributed, then his training speed would be even faster than before.That made Kai Yang a bit joyful. Even though the True Yang Tactics were powerful, it still had limitations. However if his theory was correct, then he would no longer need to worry about finding adequate training environments.Breathing out deeply, Kai Yang stood up. Using all of his concentration to sense that he truly had broken through and that he was at the initial element third stage.Thinking back to the size of the two energies that had entered his body last night, Kai Yang felt at ease.With his internal World Qi stabilized, arriving at the initial element stage, even if his World Qi amount was small, this breakthrough was clearly out of the ordinary.The World Qi in his body had succeed in increasing his heaven cycle, connecting his heaven and earth bridge and thereby increasing the speed at which his True Yang Tactics worked.Not to mention that after reaching this stage, to a certain extent, training was easier. But of course, the prerequisites was that you had a suitable cultivating environment.Walking back from Coiling Dragon Stream, Kai Yang only felt happiness. With a realm increase, his view on the world had changed a bit, resulting in his eyes becoming a bit clearer.In a fifty foot radius, he could even sense a person\u2019s breathing.Just as he was walking to his wooden hut, Kai Yang suddenly heard a familiar cry of agony. Stopping in his tracks, Kai Yang went to listen but couldn\u2019t resist the urge to laugh.How could Su Mu be beaten by someone again?But this was inside the Main Gate\u2019s territory. So if he was being beaten by someone, it was probably because of a duel. If he couldn\u2019t match up with others, then he couldn\u2019t blame anyone but himself.No matter what, Kai Yang decided to go over and see what was going on.Inside Sky Tower Pavilion, as soon as people started to duel, any place could become a battlefield. The distance from where Su Mu was getting beaten up and where Kai Yang was actually wasn\u2019t that far, and you only needed to walk a short distance before arriving.Over there, quite a number of people were spectating and as Kai Yang swept his eyes over the scene, he clearly saw two main groups of people. About ten feet away from where he was standing were the familiar Li Yun Tian and Zhao Hu and assorted other underlings. But their expressions were full of wrath as they confronted the people opposite them.It didn\u2019t seem quite right! As Kai Yang watched his, his eyebrows furrowed. The comparing of notes between Main Gate disciples, no matter who lost or won, it wouldn\u2019t escalate to such a degree. Li Yun Tian and the others clearly looked like they were feeling indignant at some injustice and like they wanted to start a gang war.p.s. I'm back! I'm back! I'm back! Ahaha, that little spoiler I revealed accidentally and that long break probably left u guys wondering right? Wellll, I'm not telling you anything so you guys can just wait for the story to unfold at the usual xianxia snail pace. \ud83d\ude00 And since Joseph G. was very generous again, this is a sponsored chapter.

    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 \u2013 Wei ZhuanPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 65 \u2013 Wei ZhuanApart from these two groups of people, there were quite a few Sky Tower disciples encircling the fighters to view the theatrics. The number of these unrelated bystanders was not little as they pointed with their fingers at the ongoing duel.Bringing with him a few doubts, Kai Yang broke through the crowd to slowly walk over to Li Yun Tian.He saw that Su Mu had a bloody nose and swollen face, he was cutting quite the sorry figure as he was facing a youngster who couldn\u2019t be much older than him. The youngster was very calm and composed, without a single sign on injury on his body as he smiled at Su Mu with a contemptuous look. As he effortlessly blocked Su Mu\u2019s attacks, he was also provoking him. And as Su Mu yelled loudly, he jumped forward but his attack was easily countered.After watching for a while, Kai Yang\u2019s eyebrows creased because he saw that it wasn\u2019t because Su Mu\u2019s attacks didn\u2019t hit that youngster, but rather Su Mu\u2019s attack had no effect even when they hit. When Su Mu\u2019s fist landed, that youngster didn\u2019t even bat an eyelid, while Su Mu on the other hand received some light injuries.Between the two, the difference in World Qi energy fluctuations was quite small, in other words, their strengths were about equal. How could their be such a large disparity when they battled?\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Kai Yang patted Li Yun Tian\u2019s shoulder as he asked.Turning around, Li Yun Tian\u2019s face turned joyous as he replied: \u201cSenior brother Kai!\u201dHearing this shout, Zhou Hu and the others saw Kai Yang and went to greet him before turning around to re-face the people facing them.\u201cHow come Su Mu is not his opponent?\u201d Kai Yang voiced his puzzlement, \u201cTheir strengths should be about the same?\u201dLi Yun Tian immediately nodded his head, however his expression fell: \u201cEn, Young Master Su is currently at the initial element second stage while that person is at the initial element third stage. If you really wanted this to be fair, then you would have to say Young Master Su is not exactly his opponent, so he would not have an easy time. But this person is despicable to the extreme. As fellow disciples when we are exchanging notes and during our duels we do not use any treasures or artifacts, however he actually dared to wear a defensive artifact. How can Su Mu\u2019s attacks show their might?\u201dWhen he heard this, Kai Yang expression showed his contemplation: \u201cDefensive artifact?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Li Yun Tian clenched his teeth: \u201cHe is the Grand Elder\u2019s flesh and blood grandson, he is called Wei Zhuan. His defensive artifact was given to him personally by the Grand Elder.\u201d\u201cAnother second generation master?\u201d Slowly things became clear. Behind Su Mu, there was an Elder and this Wei Zhuan was the grandson of the Grand Elder. Both had powerful backings, their positions were about the same, so if others didn\u2019t dare to fight Su Mu, that did not mean that Wei Zhuan didn\u2019t dare. But wearing a defensive artifact was a bit unfair.\u201cThe Grand Elder and the Second Elder were never on good terms, so much so that even Su Mu and this Wei Zhuan held unfavourable impressions of each other. Now that he has this opportunity, he definitely plans on teaching Su Mu a ruthless lesson.\u201d Li Yun Tian was secretly worried.Kai Yang oh-ed out: \u201cSo it was just some boring and senseless internal strife.\u201d\u201cSenior brother Kai, please think of a way to save Young Master Su. You know his character, if he continues like this, then he will receive heavy injuries. \u201dKai Yang remained calm: \u201cThe exchange of notes between Main Gate disciples, if you are not up to par with them then you are beaten up alittle. Are you saying that Sky Tower disciples are afraid of this?\u201d\u201cBut this duel wasn\u2019t fair from the start, and Wei Zhuan is hiding behind the might of his defensive artifact.\u201dKai Yang coolly laughed: \u201cThis world was never fair! The strong prey on the weak, the strong are respected. You guys should already know all of this.\u201d(TL: GG, Kai Yang giving us valuable life lessons. Listen well to Shi-fu Kai.)Li Yun Tian became speechless, left at a loss for words.In the exchange of notes between Main Gate disciples, they weren\u2019t able to intervene. Although Kai Yang\u2019s actions were fierce in the past, even he couldn't disobey school rules, so how could they expect him to go and save Su Mu like last time?On the battleground, Su Mu was already on the verge of collapse and his attacks no longer had much strength behind them. Wei Zhuan was laughing out loud, exceptionally pleased with this outcome. Hitting his chest proudly he said: \u201cSu Mu don\u2019t be polite, please come over. This young master is feeling very generous today, for I will not move from this spot at all. And if you are able to hurt me, then it will be my loss.\u201dSu Mu\u2019s eye\u2019s blurred, both his fists had smears of red blood over them. The defensive artifact that Wei Zhuan wore not only had defensive properties, it could also deflect World Qi imbued attacks, causing Su Mu\u2019s every attack to rebound back on him with at least half the original strength. The injuries on his fists were caused from this.Hearing Wei Zhuan\u2019s arrogant words, Su Mu spat out some blood as he retorted full of contempt: \u201cIf you have the guts then take off that turtle shell you\u2019re wearing. If this young master doesn\u2019t beat you until you can only crawl, then you aren\u2019t my grandson!\u201d(TL: So insulting Su Mu. o.o)Wei Zhuan\u2019s expression became frosty and sinister. Laughing evilly: \u201cNo small amount of courage! You actually dared to take advantage of me! You will pay for your words!\u201dWei Zhuan was clearly enraged, three steps, two steps, he rushed towards Su Mu. Throwing out a punch at Su Mu\u2019s cheek, Su Mu could only attempt to block with his hands. But his strength was already incomparable to his opponent, so he couldn\u2019t defend against it. As the punch landed, it immediately caused his cheek to swell up, and his head to turn one hundred and eighty degrees.Wei Zhuan was imposing like a tiger, walking forward he kicked out and kicked Su Mu to the ground before throwing both his fists down.Su Mu used all his strength to resists but to no avail. The defensive artifact that Wei Zhuan wore clearly held many uses and wasn\u2019t something Su Mu could contend against with his current strength.\u201cCall me grandfather and this young master will spare you!\u201d After hitting him for a while, Wei Zhuan paused to say this.Su Mu coolly looked up, smiling with disgust evident in his eyes.Last time, Su Mu narrowly avoided Cheng Shao Feng smashing a stone into his head, but he still hadn\u2019t yielded. How could he surrender this time?\u201cYou make me laugh!\u201d Wei Zhuan didn\u2019t hesitate and resumed hitting Su Mu, Su Mu\u2019s teeth went flying and his nose started to overflow with blood causing his appearance to be quite pitiful.This Wei Zhuan\u2019s hands were very fierce, even more so than Cheng Shao Feng\u2019s had been.\u201cYoung master Su!\u201d Li Yun Tian and the others could no longer bear it, but as they took a step forward they realised they couldn\u2019t do anything more, because the Main Gate rules could not be violated.Wei Zhuan didn\u2019t continue but instead turned to sneer at Li Yun Tian and the rest, he he saying: \u201cYou want to save him?\u201dLi Yun Tian and the others didn\u2019t reply but took in deep breaths, full of resentment.\u201cI asked, do you want to save him?\u201d He slapped his hand across Su Mu\u2019s face as he asked again evilly.Seeing Su Mu being attacked again, they nodded their heads but were afraid that he was scheming something.\u201cThe kneel down! Obediently kowtow a few times and if this lord is feeling good, then I shall spare him today!\u201d Since Wei Zhuan couldn\u2019t deal with Su Mu completely, he turned towards Li Yun Tian and the others. Since they were Su Mu\u2019s underlings, if they were humiliated, then it was equal to humiliating Su Mu.Hearing this, the people there went into an uproar while Li Yun Tian and the rest became ashen faced, humiliated to the extreme.Su Mu struggled to look towards them, and with his broken teeth he said: \u201cDo not listen to him!\u201d\u201cPa\u201d it rang out as Su Mu received another slap.Li Yun Tian and the others turned pale in fright because they knew that if they hesitated any further, Su Mu would only suffer more. Faces full of despair, they slowly knelt to the ground.Kai Yang looked at them in astonishment, because he would never have imagined that they would go to such an extent for Su Mu. Was there gold underneath their knees, if their relationship wasn\u2019t close, who would do this for someone?Originally Kai Yang thought that Li Yun Tian and the others followed behind the second generation Su Mu to earn some benefits, but that was clearly not the case.Wei Zhuan\u2019s eyes narrowed and he suddenly laughed loudly. Towering over them, he looked down at Su Mu: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t tell that these dogs you trained were so obedient.\u201dFrom the corners of Su Mu\u2019s eyes, leaked out two strands of tears, tears of humiliation! Even when he was beaten by Wei Zhuan to such an extent, he had yet to shed any tears, but now when he saw Li Yun Tian and the others kneeling on the ground, he couldn\u2019t restrain those tears.p.s. Hey, so not anything long because it's already 1.24am here so this is my yesterday's regular release. Will start my today's chapter, after I get some rest. But Wei Zhuan is a jackass and should go die and end his arc. Also, just wondering, if you guys have any good chinese dramas to recommend like this one, then please tell me because I'm in the mood for some dramas. Now good night. \ud83d\ude00Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Laughing out heartily he said: \u201cBut kneeling alone doesn\u2019t show your sincerity!\u201dLi Yun Tian and others became ashen faced as they clenched their teeth together before saying, their voices full of grief: \u201cWe ask that Senior Wei please be lenient.\u201dWei Zhuan narrowed his eyes and his smile gradually disappeared. Li Yun Tian and the others had shown great courage, making him slightly moved.\u201cWei Zhuan!\u201d Su Mu called out as a belly full of blood rose up, \u201cBetween you and I, we cannot exist together!\u201d\u201cYou really are resolute!\u201d Wei Zhuan clasp his two hands together and smashed down towards Su Mu\u2019s abdomen.With a loud bang, Su Mu spat out a mouthful of blood before fainting from the pain.\u201cYoung master Su!\u201d His followers bellowed out because they hadn\u2019t predicted that Wei Zhuan would break his promise in front of such a audience.\u201cDon\u2019t spare a single one!\u201d Wei Zhuan cruelly commanded his men. Then he stood up beside Su Mu and kicked him like he was kicking a dead dog to the side.The Sky Tower disciples that were previously facing Li Yun Tian and the others, sneered out and rushed over to them issuing challenges!(TL: lololol, even when they are beating up people, it\u2019s like: \u201cWait! Let\u2019s first issue a challenge, because we need to obey school rules.\u201d)Just as they were going into a rage, not knowing how to vent their anger, their enemy came knocking. Was there any reason to reject the challenges?This was a open and wild group fight, but each person had a set opponent. Wei Zhuan stood to the side as he watched and mocked: \u201cWhoever refuses to comply, beat him to death. You might as well kill him to avoid a fuss!\u201dHe clearly wanted to teach a good lesson to the people following Su Mu, to show them what lay in store for them when they followed the wrong person.Because Kai Yang had been standing close to Li Yun Tian, he was also targeted by a disciple under Wei Zhuan. This person scuttled in front of Kai Yang, stated his name and, without waiting for Kai Yang to respond, he attacked.Kai Yang sent out a kick accompanied by a thunderous sound into that person\u2019s stomach causing them to immediately crouch down.(TL: Don\u2019t mess with his waifu SM. ED: I thought KY was done with sweeping trash, appears not.)It was only because of his bad luck, with his cultivation at only the tempered body eight-ninth stage, and according to rules, he didn\u2019t have the necessary qualifications to even challenge Kai Yang. But since he had asked for a beating, he could only blame himself.Dodging through the battlefield, Kai Yang walked step by step to Su Mu.\u201cEn?\u201d Squinting his eyes towards Kai Yang, Wei Zhuan sized him up and a flash of suspicion passed through his eyes.How many people were under Su Mu, what were their names, Wei Zhuan naturally knew all this. But Kai Yang he had never met, so he temporarily didn\u2019t know Kai Yang\u2019s identity.Kai Yang silently approached Su Mu with a stoic face. Moving his hand, he went to feel for Su Mu\u2019s breathing and found out that Su Mu had only fainted; leaving him at ease.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Wei Zhuan wasn\u2019t happy. With the differences between Su Mu and himself, when this person appeared to check Su Mu\u2019s condition, it clearly showed that they didn\u2019t put him in their eyes.Standing up, Kai Yang calmly looked at Wei Zhuan.\u201cThis master asked who you are.\u201d Wei Zhuan lifted up his chin and stated in a stern voice.\u201cTrial disciple Kai Yang, please teach me!\u201d Kai Yang cupped his hands at Wei Zhuan because this was the battle etiquette between Sky Tower disciples.\u201cKai Yang?\u201d Wei Zhuan looked blankly before quickly recovering himself, \u201cYou are the Kai Yang that won against Storm House?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t dare, but if there are no other disciples called Kai Yang in the Main Gate, then that is I.\u201d\u201cWhat a joke! An insignificant trial disciple dares to come and challenge this master! Do you have the right?\u201d Wei Zhuan sneered.\u201cThe Main Gate rules state that as long as the difference in cultivation between disciples doesn\u2019t surpass three stages, then they are able to duel!\u201d\u201cThis master is at the initial element third stage, what can you be considered as?\u201d Wei Zhuan looked at him with contempt. A trial disciple, he was only a disciple that had yet to breakthrough into the initial element stage. Since he had yet to breakthrough, then their stage difference would naturally have surpassed three stages already.\u201cI am also at the initial element third stage!\u201d Kai Yang replied indifferently.A sound of bewilderment echoed.\u201cThat can\u2019t be possible. Kai Yang has already reached the initial element third stage?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t they say it took him three years to reach the tempered body third stage? Was it because he had said the wrong thing? Or did I just remember incorrectly?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s strange, Kai Yang only just recently challenged me. When he did so he was still at the tempered body eighth stage, so how could he reach this stage in less than a month?\u201dAll types of questions, by no means few in number arose.Wei Zhuan was also full of suspicions regarding Kai Yang, constantly wondering if he was lying or not. If he had reached the initial element stage, then why was he still a trial disciple?What he didn\u2019t know was that it was only last night that Kai Yang broke through. Furthermore, he had gone from the tempered body ninth stage directly to the initial element third stage.\u201cDon\u2019t I have the right to challenge you now?\u201d Kai Yang narrowed his eyes as he asked, there was an ominous glint in them.\u201cIf you really have this level of cultivation, then you have the necessary right to challenge me.\u201d Wei Zhuan nodded his head and laughed maliciously: \u201cOnly if you are not afraid of death!\u201dKai Yang laughed indifferently: \u201cI hope that you are also not afraid of death!\u201d\u201cTalking big!\u201d Wei Zhuan was angry as he thought about the fact that he was still wearing his defensive artifact. So even if he was an initial element staged martial practitioner, he still wouldn\u2019t be able to break through his defense; this made him practically invincible. While only being at the initial element third stage, how could he possibly win against me?\u201cCome. I\u2019ll allow you to punch me as a test!\u201d Wei Zhuan waved his hand towards Kai Yang, full of arrogance and anger.Would Kai Yang be courteous? Rushing forward, he directly sent a fist straight into Wei Zhuan\u2019s chest.Boiling hot Yang World Qi erupted. Not only was Wei Zhuan unharmed, Kai Yang\u2019s body instead shook as he retreated quite a few steps. Lowering his head, he saw that his hand was red; it was clear that he had been injured by his own World Qi.\u201cHehe! You overestimated yourself!\u201d Wei Zhuan was very proud of this outcome, but his face soon fell because he discovered that this Kai Yang\u2019s eyes had become red in colour. He started to emit violent and boiling hot fluctuations of World Qi from his body.In his eyes, there wasn\u2019t the slightest hit of a desire to retreat or fear, rather only excitement beyond compare. His eyes were like those of a terrible beast, looking at its prey; the slightest bit of movement would make him pounce.Without warning, Wei Zhuan started to move but Kai Yang had already pounced on him. Within his dantian, a drop of Yang Liquid disappeared and appeared in his fingers. With a simple thought, it became a blade as thin as a cicada\u2019s wing and as red as blood.A blood red ray of light flashed by, accompanied by slicing and cutting sounds as Kai Yang and Wei Zhuan exchanged blows.Wei Zhuan only felt his stomach turn cold. As he looked down, his heart dropped and he shrieked out: \u201cMy Embroided Cloud Locking Mail!\u201dThis Embroidered Cloud Locking Mail was an ordinary grade middle class artifact. Although it\u2019s rank wasn\u2019t high, it was very suitable for someone at his level. He didn\u2019t know where the Grand Elder obtained it from, but he had given it to him. Back then, the Grand Elder had said very clearly that normally, a initial element martial practitioner would be unable to break through this defensive artifact\u2019s defenses, unless they used a great killing weapon.But now, this treasure that he had such faith in, had been cut by a fellow disciple in a duel; one who was only at the initial element third stage.What martial weapon did he just use! Was that red blade also a secret weapon? And its grade should also be higher than the Embroidered Cloud Locking Mail? If not so, how could this shocking event occur?p.s. So another chapter out. By the way guys, now that it is less than a month away from when school starts, I may have to release every second day, so I can do some revision for the new school year and homework. Ew. I will try to do everyday, if not, every second day. \ud83d\ude00 Haha, also you may have not recommended some dramas, but I found some on my own. Currently I'm tl-ing and watching it~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 \u2013 You can\u2019t compare to himPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 67 \u2013 You can\u2019t compare to himAt that moment, you could even say that Wei Zhuan was oh so regretful.He was shocked that his Embroidered Cloud Locking Mail was unable to block even a single blow from his opponent, and was crying over the tear in his defensive artifact. That was because it had lost all its defensive properties now.He was extremely angry. Turning his body around, Wei Zhuan jumped towards Kai Yang and bellowed: \u201cYou dared to break my defensive artifact! I want you to die!\u201dWei Zhuan was also at the initial element third stage, so when his strength burst out, it didn\u2019t lose to Kai Yangs. But, unfortunately for him, when Kai Yang was still at the tempered body stage, he could already kill someone at the initial element fifth stage. How could an insignificant person at the initial element third stage gain any advantage?When Wei Zhuan reached Kai Yang, the blood red blade criss-crossed through the air, slashing Wei Zhuan multiple times, leaving various wounds.Wei Zhuan\u2019s body immediately froze, his fist stopping three inches away from Kai Yang. No matter how much he struggled, he couldn\u2019t move a step further because he felt a scalding hot feeling.Shuddering, his eyes turned to face the ground. Only to see the blood red blade in Kai Yang\u2019s hand, like a quick snake attacking incessantly.\u201cA defensive artifact isn\u2019t all it\u2019s made out to be.\u201d Kai Yang sneered as his eyes swept over the Embroidered Cloud Locking Mail on Wei Zhuan\u2019s body; it was full of holes and tears.Kai Yang was also shocked, because he also hadn\u2019t predicted that his Yang Liquid blade would be this powerful; it was actually this sharp.Speaking of which, Kai Yang really wanted to fight Wei Zhuan. Originally he thought he would have to use some power, but currently he had only used one drop of the Yang Liquid, to dominate him.Since the opponent used the Embroidered Cloud Locking Mail, why couldn\u2019t he use Yang Liquid.\u201cCome and try to injure me!\u201d Wei Zhuan\u2019s cheeks trembled, looking at Kai Yang with a bit of resentment. Even though his life was in the hands of Kai Yang, he wasn\u2019t the least bit afraid because he was the grandson of the Grand Elder! With a person holding such an honorable position backing him, no one in Sky Tower would dare injure him.\u201cBrat, you probably don\u2019t know but my grandfather is the Grand Elder so if you dare injure me, you are looking for death!\u201d Full of confidence, Wei Zhuan looked over at Kai Yang threateningly.Kai Yang did have a reaction when he heard this, the blood red blade between his fingers becoming more menacing and the red glint in his eyes appeared more ferocious than before.\u201cI don\u2019t know whether it's you who dies first or me?\u201d Kai Yang said to Wei Zhuan, his voice full of interest. On his face was a strange smile, and he slowly exerted strength with his fingers.Slowly, a trickle of dark red blood dripped down from Wei Zhuan\u2019s chest and he couldn\u2019t help but let out a groan. In the moment that he got injured, Wei Zhuan felt a rush of boiling hot World Qi enter him, burning his skin and flesh painfully.\u201cYou actually dared\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Zhuan looked at Kai Yang in disbelief. He couldn\u2019t believe that there were still people in Sky Tower who dared to injure him.\u201cWhether I dared or not, I have already done it. Do you say I don\u2019t dare?\u201d Kai Yang continued to exert strength and pushed the blade half an inch deeper, causing the blood to continuously flow out. Showing his cowardly inside Wei Zhuan cried out: \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid that my grandfather will kill you!\u201d\u201cIn the comparing of notes between disciples, one is responsible for their own life and death!\u201d Kai Yang sneered out coldly, \u201cIf you can\u2019t compare to others, you can\u2019t blame others for killing you. What can the Grand Elder do? Sky Tower Pavilion does not belong to him.\u201dWei Zhuan, to this frantic to the point of craziness disciple, felt shivers and cold all over.Just as he was about to speak, Kai Yang suddenly interrupted him: \u201cIf you say I concede, these two words, I will kill you. So don\u2019t even think about it.\u201dWei Zhuan became deathly white because he had just thought of conceding. In a battle between disciples, if one felt that they were unable to match up against their opponent, they were able to concede. Then their opponent could not pursue them or attack them any further.But now he didn\u2019t dare to say these two words, because he couldn\u2019t see any hint that Kai Yang was joking in his crazy but serious eyes.\u201cWhat do you really want to do?\u201d Wei Zhuan clenched his teeth as he asked this.\u201cI\u2019m don\u2019t want to do anything. I\u2019m just thinking how you can\u2019t compare to Su Mu because you relied on your defensive artifact to win against him!\u201d Kai Yang said as he slowly shook his head.\u201cI can\u2019t compare to him?\u201d Wei Zhuan was like a cat that had its tail stepped on. Lowly shouting: \u201cHow can I not compare to him? My strength is higher than his, my status is also higher, so how am I not comparable to him?\u201dKai Yang shifted his head to the side: \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me? I\u2019ll show you.\u201dStopping his words, Kai Yang exerted some strength with his fingers causing Wei Zhuan face to contort and shiver uncontrollably.Kai Yang turned around to size up Wei Zhuan\u2019s underlings. Previously they were fighting against Li Yun Tian and the others with all their might. But as soon as they saw Wei Zhaun fall, they stopped fighting and didn\u2019t dare to do anything other than stare stupidly.\u201cDo you want to save your young master Wei Zhuan?\u201d Kai Yang asked them.No one dared to reply because they were all terrified at Kai Yang\u2019s craziness. After his display of ferociousness, how could any of the ten or so young men dare to confront him?\u201cIf you want to save him, then obediently kneel down and admit you were wrong! If I feel merciful, I will spare him!\u201d Kai Yang coldly laughed out.Their faces paled, this\u2026\u2026didn\u2019t Wei Zhuan just say this to Su Mu\u2019s underlings?After Su Mu\u2019s underlings heard this, they had kneeled without hesitation and kowtowed to Wei Zhuan. Did that mean they had to do the same?These people just stared, because if they kneeled, then they would lose a great amount of face. Without face, how could they continue to stay in Sky Tower? But if they didn\u2019t kneel and Wei Zhuan blamed them, what would they do?Each person\u2019s face was different, each contemplative and unsure as to which decision to make.\u201cIt looks like you want him to die.\u201d Kai Yang sighed out softly, and pushed the blade a bit further into Wei Zhuan\u2019s body.Wei Zhuan cried out in fright, because he could feel that if the blade in Kai Yang\u2019s hands were to penetrate even deeper, then it would stab his heart.That was a fatal attack!Wei Zhuan didn\u2019t want to die and shouted out in desperation with a hoarse voice at his underlings: \u201cWhy are you still dawdling? Hurry up and kneel down! If I am to die, then none of you shall be spared!\u201dOnly then did the underlings under Wei Zhuan shake their bodies and kneel down.Watching this scene, Li Yun Tian and the others were overwhelmed with emotions, because the previous injustices they had suffered were being washed away by their actions. They were much more carefree.Kai Yang turned back to Wei Zhuan, enthusiastically saying: \u201cNow do you know the difference between you and Su Mu?\u201dWei Zhuan looked on blankly before his face suddenly changed and he looked at his underlings with a gaze full of malice.In order to save Su Mu\u2019s life, Li Yun Tian and the others threw away their pride. But how about his underlings? Only when he had bellowed out and threatened their lives, did they grudgingly obey Kai Yang\u2019s request.When comparing the two, the difference between Wei Zhuan and Su Mu became clear. In personal charisma, Wei Zhuan couldn\u2019t compare to Su Mu.\u201cAre you satisfied now?\u201d Wei Zhuan asked, looking at Kai Yang coldly.Kai Yang narrowed his eyes, his expression unreadable.Wei Zhuan turned pale with fright and said in a shrill voice: \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly\u2026..\u201dBut before Kai Yang could reply, from afar, a voice bellowed out in rage: \u201cDetain them all!\u201dp.s. Ho ho ho! I wonder which powerful guy has come over in a fit! Is it Su Mu's elder? Or is it Wei Zhuan's granddaddy? Or is it Kai Yang's potential backer??? Hmmmmmm??? Anyway, please thank Joseph G. again for sponsoring this chapter! \ud83d\ude00Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 \u2013 A sinful desirePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 68 \u2013 A sinful desireImmediately after this order, a row of people appeared in front of Kai Yang and without waiting giving an explanation, one of them attacked Kai Yang. Groaning out, he flew backwards.\u201cSenior brother Kai!\u201d Li Yun Tian and the others turned in pale in fright and quickly rushed forward to help him up.Kai Yang struggled to stand up, and while sighing out exasperatedly, he looked at the new youth. He stood beside Wei Zhuan, supporting Wei Zhuan with one hand and directing a look filled with maliciousness at Kai Yang, he spoke out: \u201cYoung master Zhuan, are you alright?\u201dWei Zhuan looked over at Kai Yang, his gaze full of poison. His body appeared a bit unstable and he shook his head: \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good that you are fine. I have come late.\u201d The youth spoke again. Although his strength was above Wei Zhuan\u2019s, he was still a person under the Grand Elder so his position was naturally below Wei Zhuan\u2019s.\u201cYou are considered too late!\u201d Wei Zhuan laughed out, and peculiarly asked: \u201cSenior brother Cao, ever since you became a Disciplinary Disciple, you should understand school rules better than any of us. So I ask u, if one was to murder another in the Main Gate, what would their punishment be?\u201dCao Zheng Wen sneered, booming out: \u201cThis is very serious. We would first break their arms and legs, then expel them from the school and then kill them. This also acts as a warning for others!\u201dWei Zhuan hehe laughed and pointed his finger at Kai Yang: \u201cJust then, this person threatened to kill me! Senior brother Cao, punish him as you see fit!\u201dWith someone backing him now, how could Wei Zhuan possibly continue to act as submissively as before?Cao Zheng Wen sternly asked: \u201cYou are serious?\u201dWei Zhuan coldly nodded non-stop: \u201cSenior brother Cao, when you arrived, didn\u2019t you see everything that happened with your own two eyes?\u201dCao Zheng Wen nodded his head: \u201cThat\u2019s right, when I arrived, I truly saw this person, with a lethal weapon, pointing it at your chest. If I had not hurriedly blocked his attack, then you would have long since fallen under his poisonous hands. This person actually dared to act so brazenly during the day while breaking school regulations!\u201dThese two sang the same tune well, in sync with each other, and managed to put Kai Yang under suspicion of attempted murder.\u201cNonsense!\u201d Li Yun Tian hissed out, \u201cJust then, senior brother Kai and Wei Zhuan were only duelling and exchanging notes. How could it be as serious as the way you guys are presenting it?\u201dCao Zheng Wen snorted: \u201cIt was as simple as exchanging notes?\u201dZhao Hu answered: \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe it, then you can ask any of the disciples here who came to watch the fun. They were all witnesses to this. Furthermore, this entire thing was first started by Wei Zhuan. Senior brother Kai was dragged into this.\u201d\u201cThere are witnesses, who are the witnesses?\u201d Wei Zhuan tilted his head, chuckling as he looked around.The Sky Tower disciples that were watching immediately scattered like birds and disappeared. They had naturally heard how it involved the Grand Elder, and didn\u2019t have the courage to involve themselves. No matter which side they offended or sided with, their future days in Sky Tower would be painful.Li Yun Tian saw this and became speechless and wanted to cry out, but he steadied himself enough to say: \u201cThis entire event has been witnessed by us. Each and every detail was seen clearly. We are the witnesses!\u201dCao Zheng Wen shooked his head: \u201cYou guys were gathered together and brawled, so you were preoccupied. How are you able to testify?\u201d\u201cGathered together to brawl?\u201d Zhou Hu jumped up and bellowed: \u201cIt was clearly Wei Zhuan commanding his underlings to challenge us, how could it be described as a group brawl? Cao Zheng Wen, don\u2019t think that just because you are a Disciplinary Disciple you can do whatever you want. It hasn\u2019t reached the point where you can freely make decisions in Sky Tower.\u201d\u201cImpudence!\u201d Cao Zheng Wen reprimanded, \u201cThe Disciplinary Hall represents the school\u2019s rule and upholds the regulations, so they are always just and impartial. You actually dare to question the Disciplinary Hall\u2019s authority, your crimes are increased by one!\u201d\u201cIf you want to condemn me, no need to worry about the pretext right?\u201d Kai Yang waved his hand to silence Li Yun Tian and sneered at Cao Zheng Wen, \u201cJust and fair? Today, I truly experienced what is just and fair.\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201d Grinning coldly, Cao Zheng Wen walked forward and ordered, full of grandeur: \u201cArrest them all! After discussions with the Grand Elder, the punishments will commence!\u201d\u201cSou sou!\u201d The sound of clothes swishing and rapid movement rang out, and out of nowhere appeared more than a dozen Disciplinary Disciples from all directions. The weakest of them were at the initial element fifth stage, so how could Li Yun Tian and the rest be their opponents? In three steps, two moves, they pressed them down to the ground in a kneeling posture. Kai Yang didn\u2019t resist, because he knew nothing would happen even if he resisted.\u201cLet\u2019s see in the future!\u201d With the cowardly Wei Zhuan accomplishing his goal, he walked in front of Kai Yang grinning smugly.\u201cTake them away!\u201d Cao Zheng Wen ordered, and the Disciplinary Disciples took them away.Looking over at Su Mu who was lying unconscious, Cao Zheng Wen wrinkled his eyebrows because apprehending Kai Yang, Li Yun Tian and the rest was a simple matter but apprehending Su Mu wasn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t dare act and thought for a while before saying: \u201cTake junior brother Su to the Second Elder\u2019s place.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Someone replied, and went to pick up Su Mu from the ground before carrying him away.(TL: Princess hold???? :D)\u201cYoung master Zhuan, you have suffered!\u201d Cao Zheng Wen softly said.Wei Zhuan narrowed his eyes and gnashed his teeth: \u201cThat person called Kai Yang, you definitely must not let him off easy! He has humiliated me today and made me suffer endlessly! You should know what to do!\u201dCao Zheng Wen looked a bit hesitant: \u201cYoung master Zhuan, today\u2019s event was somewhat big and Grand Elder Hui will definitely be notified. If we were to act now, it would be somewhat inappropriate. Why don\u2019t we act after the Grand Elder has made his decision.\u201d\u201cBut I can\u2019t swallow this rage!\u201d Wei Zhuan\u2019s face revealed his evil intentions.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will help young master Zhuan relieve a bit of your anger and teach him properly. I shall teach him what the consequences are for offending young master Zhuan.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t kill him, I want to personally deal with him!\u201d\u201cIt shall be as you say!\u201dKai Yang and the rest were currently being imprisoned in the Sky Tower Forest Prison. It was very dark and damp, with dense cold air, they were accompanied by many rats and mozzies. From all directions a hideous stench wafted towards them, making one want to puke. Overall, it was an uninhabitable environment.The Forest Prison was the place where Sky Tower imprisoned disciples who committed mistakes. Li Yun Tian and the rest never thought that they would one day be imprisoned here, it left a bitter aftertaste.\u201cSenior brother Kai, we have dragged you into this.\u201d Li Yun Tian sat next to Kai Yang and softly apologised.Kai Yang smiled: \u201cThis isn\u2019t related to you, I couldn\u2019t hold back and jumped into the situation. I couldn\u2019t bear to see our people bite each other like dogs.\u201d\u201cBite each other like dogs\u2026\u2026.\u201d Li Yun Tian felt like choking, wasn\u2019t he including them when he was cursing Wei Zhuan\u2019s people?\u201cPutting it in a better light, it would be a family quarrel, but if you put it bluntly, isn\u2019t it dogs biting one another?\u201d Kai Yang asked as he chuckled.\u201cI guess you're right. But senior brother Kai don\u2019t worry, young master Su definitely won\u2019t abandon us. We only need to wait a few hours here, and young master Su will come and rescue us.\u201d The way Li Yun Tian thought was relatively simple.Kai Yang turned his body and repositioned himself so he was in a more comfortable position: \u201cTo ask you, why are the Grand Elder and the Second Elder so against each other?\u201dLi Yun Tian sighed out as if he expected this question: \u201cThis is related to the school Head.\u201d\u201cEh? Let me hear the details.\u201d(TL: Title Unlocked \u2013 Gossiper)Li Yun Tian began: \u201cLast time young master Su told you about the Head\u2019s disciples\u2019 affair right? Ever since the Head left to capture his second disciple and trap him in Coiling Dragon Stream, our head has rarely appeared in public ever since. He doesn\u2019t even pay much attention to the internal affairs of the school, so these past several years they have been all managed by the Grand Elder. Maybe it\u2019s because of ambition, but regardless, the Grand Elder now acts like he is the Head. Seeing this, the Second Elder has become displeased and thinks that the Grand Elder has thoughts of usurping the Head for the position, and because of these things, there is naturally friction and disputes between them.\u201dp.s. Long time to see. First I'm sorry for the lack of releases, I needed to do h/w and the like and prepare for school in 2 wks, urgh\u2026\u2026\u2026 -_- I will finish the last sponsored tomorrow~. Good night and I hope you guys enjoyed the chapter but Cao Zheng Wen pissed both Ben and I out too much. Go die please.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 \u2013 The difference between a disciple and an ancestorPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 69 \u2013 The difference between a disciple and an ancestor\u201cCurrently in Sky Tower the Grand Elder, Fourth Elder and Fifth Elder have all banded together, with the Grand Elder leading them. Meanwhile the Second Elder and Third Elder are opposing them, representing and supporting the current Head. In these past few years, the Second Elder and Third Elder have suffered much in this bitter battle.\u201dListening to Li Yun Tian, Kai Yang immediately understood the situation much more clearly then he had previously.Since the elders did not get along, then the younger generations naturally wouldn\u2019t get along. Su Mu and Wei Zhuan\u2019s disputes were probably a result of this.Zhao Hu sneered: \u201cIt\u2019s only because the tiger doesn\u2019t leave it\u2019s cave, so the monkey is acting like the king. If the Head decided to reappear, what importance would the Grand Elder and them then hold?\u201dLi Yun Tian glared at Zhao Hu: \u201cDon\u2019t gossip behind other\u2019s backs. Us younger generation can\u2019t disrespect our elders, even if we disapprove of their ways.\u201dZhao Hu poked out his tongue and muttered: \u201cDon\u2019t you also think like this.\u201dLi Yun Tian said: \u201cBut I won\u2019t say it out loud.\u201dAt the Contribution Hall, Xia Ning Chang hurriedly, panting with exhaustion ran over. Seeing her like that, Old Meng laughed at her: \u201cMy disciple, you have come to visit your master again? En, such a filial disciple, I am happy.\u201dXia Ning Chang impatiently said: \u201cMaster, big news, bad news.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Meng Wu Ya was a bit puzzled because he had never seen his disciple this flustered before.Xia Ning Chang immediately started to narrate the things that happened between Kai Yang and the others, along with Wei Zhuan.Meng Wu Ya became quite gloomy when he finished listening: \u201cYou\u2019re saying that brat Kai Yang has already reached the initial element third stage? He also defeated Wei Zhuan?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Xia Ning Chang kept on nodding her head, whilst thinking that she had also assisted him in breaking through.\u201cLooks like that lucky encounter he had in the Black Wind Mountains last time wasn\u2019t small. Such an astonishing rate of growth.\u201d Meng Wu Ya said, slightly shocked.\u201cMaster don\u2019t sigh away your sorrows, please hurry up and think of a method to save him.\u201d Xia Ning Chang impatiently said.Meng Wu Ya looked at her blankly and said in a strange voice to his disciple: \u201cMy dear disciple, why are this nervous?\u201dAt a loss, Xia Ning Chang stammered out: \u201cI am?\u201d\u201cEn, you are currently very nervous.\u201d Meng Wu Ya nodded his head. In all these years, although she was as clear as ice and as pure as jade, he still understood her the best, but he had never seen her like this before. In all the years he had known her, there had been countless male disciples who chased after her, but she didn\u2019t pay much attention to them at all. She maintained a respectful distance from them all, yet today she had asked him for help for save a mere person at the initial element third stage; how very queer.Xia Ning Chang continued: \u201cI just don\u2019t want his fruitful cultivation journey to suffer such a major setback.\u201d\u201cYou are very close with him?\u201d Meng Wu Ya immediately became alert.\u201cWe are not close, but I have watched over him for two years already. Master you know that I am a Dark Hall Disciple and have been assigned to watch over his area.\u201d Xia Ning Chang honestly said and after this, she continued to plead: \u201cMaster please think of a way to save him. This time he has offended the Grand Elder and if there isn\u2019t someone powerful there to save him, then I\u2019m afraid he will meet a calamity. Not to mention that the Second Elder may not necessarily care about his life or death, but master you are that powerful someone!\u201dMeng Wu Ya\u2019s face was full of pleasure, because no matter if there were a thousand flatteries or even ten thousand flatteries, they would not affect him. But this time, it was his beloved disciple who was flattering him.After his wave of excitement passed, Meng Wu Ya frowned: \u201cMy disciple, this matter isn\u2019t easily intervened in. No matter how you look at it, it is an internal situation within Sky Tower involving the Elders, whereas I am only a caretaker, what would it mean if I intervened.\u201dThis was the truth. Although his impression of Kai Yang wasn\u2019t bad, how could he, an outsider dare to interfere in the internal affairs of the school?Xia Ning Chang didn\u2019t reply, but only lifted her head and directed her watery eyes at Meng Wu Ya. Although there was a veil covering her face, Meng Wu Ya could still see her fiery cheeks.This was the type of face he could not resist, bitterly, Meng Wu Ya said: \u201cAi~yo wei! My young lady, please don\u2019t be stubborn. Not to mention that the Second Elder will definitely go and save Kai Yang. Kai Yang was only involved because he went to save Su Mu, so if he doesn\u2019t help him, then how would he be able to recruit more people in the future and gain their respect and trust?\u201d\u201cIf it, it isn\u2019t so?\u201d Xia Ning Chang asked angrily.\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any situation in which he doesn\u2019t.\u201d But Meng Wu Ya wasn\u2019t certain, because in a high level battle, to sacrifice one or two unimportant, low levelled disciples wasn\u2019t uncommon.\u201cHumph!\u201d Xia Ning Chang turned her body and walked up to the seat next to him, saying sulkily: \u201cMaster, if you don\u2019t go to save him, I will stay here forever. I\u2019m afraid that your disciple\u2019s cultivation will stop here.\u201dHearing these words, Meng Wu Ya turned pale in fright, and submissively rushed out from behind the counter. Bending his waist, he waited on Xia Ning Chang like he was waiting on his master: \u201cWhy did you say this?\u201dXia Ning Chang turned her head to the side, not speaking a word.Meng Wu Ya changed his position again so he was once again facing Xia Ning Chang: \u201cPlease tell me, if I don\u2019t help him you won\u2019t leave where?\u201d\u201cSince you already don\u2019t care about his life or death, you won\u2019t care about my life or death either. Master it appears you are this type of untrustworthy person regarding justice!\u201dThese words were like a sharp arrow, they pierced straight through Meng Wu Ya. Then it was like he was struck by lightning, shaking all over before shattering into a thousand pieces.\u201cMy lady, my dear lady, if we need to discuss things, let\u2019s discuss them in a peaceful manner? My old bones can\u2019t bear the burden of your tricks.\u201d Meng Wu Ya repeatedly bowed to her with his hand in front of him in a petty and low manner.How was this treatment fitting towards a disciple, it was clearly treatment saved for an ancestor.Only then did Xia Ning Chang turn her head back and softly say to Meng Wu Ya: \u201cHe trains in a Yang attributed martial skill, and his Yang World Qi is highly pure and dense!\u201d\u201cYang attributed World Qi?\u201d Meng Wu Ya\u2019s expression changed greatly, \u201cHighly pure and dense?\u201d\u201cIt is at least five times better than that last person you found!\u201d Xia Ning Chang answered.\u201cYou have tested this?\u201d Meng Wu Ya impatiently asked for confirmation regarding this.\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s like this, then he definitely can\u2019t meet any accidents!\u201d Meng Wu Ya suddenly straightened up. After thinking for a while, he started to walk outside.Walking to the entrance he stopped, and to turned to ask Xia Ning Chang: \u201cMy disciple, do you reject him?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t reject him!\u201d Xia Ning Chang slowly replied.\u201cThen you like him?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like either, I just don\u2019t hate him.\u201d This line of questioning made Xia Ning Chang turn quite red.\u201cOkay, okay, okay. You should also know what you need to do if you go there. But you must promise your master that you won\u2019t develop feelings for him, only then will I go and save him!\u201d\u201cMaster what are you talking about!\u201d Xia Ning Chang was full of shyness, \u201cI still haven\u2019t even spoken to him.\u201dThese words caused Xia Ning Chang to become less confident and she couldn\u2019t help but think about the events that night.\u201cThe reason why I am stopping your affections is because\u2026\u2026..this small place isn\u2019t where you truly belong. There also aren\u2019t any people here who are qualified for your love, and sooner or later you will reach a place no one can imagine. By then, you will be able to live for hundreds of years, even thousands of years, meanwhile the people you love will slowly age and die in front of you and your master doesn\u2019t want you to suffer that pain. My disciple, you must remember, the martial peak is a lonely and solitary journey, an extremely high peak full of coldness!\u201dp.s. Last sponsored by Joseph G. Thank you and thank you for pointing out that mistake last chapter with the ples. It was actually a part that I accidentally deleted while deleting the raws. Haha. Well now the plot thickens, since we know Meng Meng is referencing the summary and hinting on the future. But he lost a lot of dignity this chapter, but trying hard to regain that lost dignity in the end.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 \u2013 1 vs. 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 70 \u2013 1 vs. 5As Meng Wu Ya said these words, he also sighed like he was a in a constant state of sadness. Listening to him explain himself, Xia Ning Chang could hear the sadness and grief in his words.Could it be that her master had experienced this before? Just as she wanted to asked him further, Meng Wu Ya had disappeared from her sight.Right at that moment in the Black Wind Trade in front of one of the Sky Tower wooden houses, a youngster dripping with sweat was standing. Knocking lightly on the door, he calmed his breathing and called out: \u201cSenior sister Su.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d A pleasant but cold voice rang out. This voice was nice to hear, but it was permeated with a frostiness that didn\u2019t allow anyone to come close.That youngster\u2019s sweat had condensed into droplets and quivered as he said: \u201cYoung master Su Mu has been beaten unconscious, meanwhile the people under him have been detained by the Disciplinary Hall and locked in the Forest Prison.\u201dJust as these words left his mouth, the wooden door abruptly opened and the white clothed Su Yan appeared.That person quickly retreated two steps and lowered his face because he didn\u2019t dare to look into her unblemished and flawless gaze.\u201cSay it clearly, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Su Yan coldly asked, spreading a frosty air around her and the wooden house. \u2018Ka ka\u2019 sounds could be heard as ice appeared on the floor around her.The youngster immediately began narrating the story from beginning to end in the most concise way possible. After finishing his report, he waited for quite a while, but hearing no response, he mustered the courage to ask: \u201cSenior sister Su?\u201dAfter calling out with no response, this person courageously lifted up his head to look at her, but there wasn\u2019t even a hint of her figure; she had left before he could react.\u201cMy lord!\u201d That Sky Tower disciple collapsed on the spot and fell butt first onto the ground.This senior sister Su is too cold! In the future, the person who takes her as their wife, will need a quilt in the hot summer, in order to not freeze to death. But for someone cold and mighty like senior sister Su, there shouldn\u2019t be any man that can match her?(TL: ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) )No one could have imagined that the friction between the younger Sky Tower disciples would cause such huge waves.Inside the Sky Tower Forest Prison, Kai Yang, Li Yun Tian and the others were still trapped. They had been locked inside for an entire hour already, without the slightest hint of motion outside.Li Yun Tian and the rest had started to become anxious, wondering why Su Mu had yet to come and rescue them. But after thinking for a while, they remembered that Su Mu had been knocked unconscious. So if he wasn\u2019t conscious, how could he come and save them.Just as they were feeling anxious, the prison doors were suddenly opened and they heard the echo of footsteps. A Disciplinary Disciple came up to the cell where Kai Yang and the others were locked up and yelled: \u201cWho is Kai Yang?\u201dKai Yang called out in reply: \u201cI am!\u201d\u201cFollow me!\u201d That disciplinary Disciple very impolitely ordered him so, \u201cSomeone wants to see you.\u201dKai Yang\u2019s expression shifted and he laughed out coldly. Without any fear, he stepped out and followed.\u201cSenior brother Kai, don\u2019t go. Wait for young master Su to come and save us.\u201d Li Yun Tian cried out in great alarm, pulling on Kai Yang.\u201cLet go!\u201d That Disciplinary Disciple bellowed in anger, \u201cAnyone who dares to block even a step, would be making a direct challenge to the Disciplinary Hall. You should be clear regarding the consequences.\u201dKai Yang said to Li Yun Tian: \u201cI\u2019m just going to have a look, no need to be alarmed.\u201dLi Yun Tian helplessly let go and said in a sunken tone: \u201cSenior brother Kai, please be careful!\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201d That Disciplinary Disciple sarcastically laughed, \u201cYou overestimate yourself.\u201dWalking out of the cell, the Disciplinary Disciple locked up the doors once again and then took Kai Yang outside.Not long after, they had arrived at a wooden room and a strange laugh came: \u201cPlease come in.\u201dKai Yang turned to look at him and also laughed out as he walked in.The Disciplinary Disciple followed closely behind and then closed the door behind him.In the instant the door was closed, Kai Yang swivelled around and sent a palm directly into the stomach of the Disciplinary Disciple behind him. Boiling hot Yang World Qi rushed into him, causing him to let out a bloodcurdling scream as he slammed into the wall.He didn\u2019t think that Kai Yang would actually strike him, causing him to receive the attack in it\u2019s entirety and leaving him momentarily paralysed.\u201cSuch big dog courage!\u201d A voice full of anger sounded and immediately three-four human images appeared, pouncing on Kai Yang.Kai Yang could reaction only allowed him to block one attack as the others landed, pushing him to the ground. Them he began to receive a thorough beating.In the midst of that chaos, Kai Yang snarled as he spat out a mouthful of blood. The fishy yet sweet smell of blood, only caused to excite him and heat up his blood, the True Yang Tactics started to work at an unimaginable speed within his meridians. The scalding feeling from his bones travelled throughout his whole body, causing Kai Yang\u2019s skin to become fiery.This energy seemed to be many times stronger than it had been previously.Rawr! The Kai Yang that was being kicked was suddenly disturbed, then his frenzied actions became several times more ferocious. Jumping into the air, he kicked out and hit two Disciplinary Disciples on the head, this was followed by two cries of pain as they stumbled back.But before he could continue, another person, emitting killing intent, had managed to grab onto his leg. Then, tossing him like a rag bag, they threw Kai Yang, slamming him into the wall. Groaning in pain, he felt his 5 viscera turn over.Struggling up, Kai Yang wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and sized up the situation in the dimly lit room.This was a closed private room with five Disciplinary Disciple in it. From their exchange just now and their World Qi fluctuations, Kai Yang could tell that their strengths were about initial element ** stage. But the one that had thrown him into the wall, his World Qi aura clearly showed that he had entered the qi transforming stage.One vs. five! Not to mention the the differences in their cultivation levels was also immense, this battle was doomed to end in failure.But Kai Yang only smiled. In this hopeless situation, his heart only became more ferocious, raging with emotion.\u201cYou actually dared to injure someone on your own accord!\u201d The qi transforming stage Disciplinary Disciple sneered out, \u201cYou have no lack of courage!\u201dThe other four people were standing behind him, looking at Kai Yang mockingly.They had received Cao -what\u2019s his name?\u2019s order to properly teach Kai Yang a lesson, as long as they didn\u2019t kill him. Unexpectedly Kai Yang had attacked first and injured one of them by catching him unaware, making them lose a great deal of face.\u201cHe he.\u201d With his back facing the wall, Kai Yang\u2019s blood red eyes swept across the five of them as he said in an icy cold voice: \u201cYou guys are allowed to attack, so why can\u2019t I retaliate?\u201dThat qi transforming stage Disciplinary Disciple couldn\u2019t stop his evil laughter: \u201cYou are actually quite smart, since you already know what we are thinking about. Why don\u2019t you obediently allow us to beat you up, so we can help young master Wei Zhuan vent his unhealthy anger. If you dare to resist, you might lose an arm or leg!\u201d\u201cYou can come and try!\u201d Kai Yang looked at them coldly.\u201cStubborn headed pig! Go beat him!\u201dUnder that command, the five of them went out again! Their hands fierce without the slightest bit of hesitation. With their cultivations, they would have more than enough energy, with some to spare as they took care of Kai Yang. So as the five leaped forward to teach Kai Yang a lesson, it was naturally an easy thing to do!p.s. Well, well, well. Ganging up on someone to beat them is not a good thing to do. But it's good that ST has such strict rules that make sure that disciples kill each other, phew. Also the friendship between Su Mu, Li Yun Tian, Kai Yang and the others is such a nice thing to read about. I mean the others, they stay mortal enemies but this one they made up and become brothers~ I almost forgot, this is the first regular of the week and I hope you enjoyed the chapter. Await tomorrow's chappy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 \u2013 FreakPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 71 \u2013 FreakInside the room was total chaos, with angry shouts thundering and punches echoing. Occasionally, there would be the sound of someone grunting and specks of blood could be seen flying out.As the saying goes, fours hands are hard to defend against with only two. There was already a large difference between their levels and Kai Yang\u2019s, not to mention it was one against five. How could he possibly hold against them on his own?Attacking out once at someone, he would have to endure four or five hits himself.Not to mention the power of these Disciplinary Disciple\u2019s strikes. Each strike was strong and landed on flesh. Although they weren\u2019t be life threatening to Kai Yang, after taking so many strikes, anybody would need to lay in bed for one or two months to recuperate.\u201cStop!\u201d After a good half an hour, the qi transforming staged Disciplinary Disciple called out angrily and quickly leapt away from the battle scene, \u201cDon\u2019t hit him anymore. If you hit him further, he will die.\u201dThe remaining four quickly leapt back and looked at Kai Yang who lay on the floor, with a bit of fear and worry.\u201cMy Lord!\u201d Amongst them, one of them held their cheeks and said, \u201cBeing hit by him once, nearly caused me to lose my tooth.\u201dAnother clutched at his crotch, a face full of fear: \u201cDaddy nearly lost his future generations. If I had not dodged in time, then the one lying on the floor would be me.\u201dDodging at the crucial moment, the blow had landed on his thigh, causing him to feel scalding pain. A hit that was from Kai Yang struggling with all his might was extremely powerful. Even thinking about it now, left him with shivers.The looked at each other, staring blankly on, because in that situation with such a disparity in their strengths, each one of them had a visible injury from Kai Yang. Even if they had knocked him to the ground, weakened.This caused the five people to be stupefied! Their five faces then became embarrassed, isn\u2019t this too embarrassing?How could a trial disciple, who was only at the initial element third stage be so savage? Just then while they were beating him up, they didn\u2019t think too much about it. But thinking over it now, it was all quite inconceivable.\u201cPu\u2026\u2026..\u201d A sound was heard. Looking to the origin of the sound, five gazes fell on Kai Yang who should have been paralysed, who was struggling to stand up as he spat out the blood in his mouth.His body looked dark and unclear, with great changes occuring, his skin started to shine with a red light. An extremely hot feeling could be felt emanating from him, like a ten million year old volcano was erupting.\u201cThis World Qi aura\u2026\u2026.\u201d The qi transforming staged disciple\u2019s face showed a trace of fear, \u201cSomething\u2019s not quite right.\u201dHow was this the World Qi Aura that a disciple at the initial element third stage supposed to have? This was clearly the aura of someone at the peak of the initial element stage, and with another step, they would be in the qi transforming stage.\u201cYou are still able to stand?\u201d A person said with their eyes wide open, nearly biting their tongue in the process. Even if it was him who had been beaten like that, he wouldn\u2019t even have enough strength to lift a finger. How could he stand up?\u201cHe\u2019s coming!\u201d Someone else suddenly cried out in alarm. Just as the words were spoken, the previously tottering Kai Yang produced a large gale and sprinted to the five in front of him.Halfway there, Kai Yang\u2019s fist became blazing, like a piece of metal that had just been taken out of a furnace.The person who had cried out immediately activated his World Qi and clashed with Kai Yang\u2019s fist.\u2018Bang\u2019 it rang out, then the Disciplinary Disciple flew backwards and smashed into the wall. His throat gurgling, he spat out a mouthful of blood, meanwhile Kai Yang\u2019s body only lightly shook as he went to the next person already.\u201cImpudent!\u201d The qi transforming stage Disciplinary Disciple was agitated and angered. His five fellow disciples were not only unable to knock down a single opponent, instead their enemy was given the chance to retaliate. If this was spread out,wouldn\u2019t it be a scandal? Where would he go and put his face?In a fit of anger, the qi transforming staged disciple sent out his palm. Condensing his qi from his dantian, he shouted out: \u201cStrengthened Revolving Cyclone!\u201dInside the room, a splitting wind howl sounded and from his hand, a small cyclone appeared. It directly went to confront Kai Yang\u2019s fist.Snap, snap, snap\u2026\u2026\u2026echoed out, while the clothes on Kai Yang\u2019s arm looked like they were being repeatedly cut by razor blades, turning into shreds in just moments. His entire arm was covered in bloody cuts.Both of Kai Yang\u2019s blood red eyes contained astonishment. Gathering up his Yang World Qi, it exited his body via the cuts on his arm to block his opponent\u2019s martial skill.\u2018Ah\u2019 rang out, as a blazing energy exploded within the room.Kai Yang\u2019s World Qi stopped that qi transforming staged disciple\u2019s Strengthened Revolving Cyclone and set it on fire.Within the blazing cyclone, Kai Yang punched out towards that qi transforming stage disciple\u2019s palm. Upon impact, both sides retreated a few steps.\u201cWhy are you guys standing around distracted? Go attack!\u201d The qi transforming stage disciple\u2019s palm was very red. He never thought that his opponent\u2019s World Qi was this unusual. Although he hadn\u2019t suffered any injuries, but no matter what, he still had suffered some deficit. In rage, he immediately howled out.The other three Disciplinary Disciples who were in a stupor now awoke and rushed up to surround Kai Yang once again. Facing Kai Yang, they were in for more painful attacks.The person who had been sent flying by Kai Yang first also charged back in a fit of anger.In a short while, the four people stopped their attacks. While breathing in deeply, they also held treacherous expressions as they retreated ten feet.Their strengths were currently being suppressed by his younger disciple\u2019s savage might.The second time they gathered to beat him up, the results were drastically smaller!The injuries that Kai Yang sustained this time were far greater, but\u2026\u2026these four people had paid a certain price to achieve this.\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t stand up again, would he?\u201d One of them covered their mouth coughing while asking this question. Finishing his coughing, there was a small pool of blood in his palm.\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t, after all he has been injured to this state.\u201d Another one was massaging his eye. There, a bruise had already formed, while a nasty blister was present, like it had been constantly burned by boiling water.Within their five hearts, they all felt extremely bitter. They thought the reason why they had suffered so much this time was because of his strange strength.Within this small and narrow room, although it was five against one and it looked easy to beat him up, they couldn\u2019t exert all their might, whereas Kai Yang was surrounded. This allowed him to use his full power, but if it was an open environment, they would be able to use their full power. Then it wouldn\u2019t be such a sad result right?But\u2026..this junior disciple called Kai Yang, his strength was really something else. An ordinary initial element person wasn\u2019t their opponent at all. No wonder Wei Zhuan lost under his hand.Just as the five of them thought they had beaten Kai Yang down, he unexpectedly started to move again. Weakened beyond compare, like a wolf without fangs, bit by bit, cun by cun he stood up. Not only had his World Qi aura not diminished, it had strengthened.\u201cCurse it!\u201d That qi transforming stage disciple cursed, what sort of freak was this junior disciple? No matter how they attacked him, why didn\u2019t he fall unconscious?\u201cDon\u2019t come over. If you come over, we will really beat you to death!\u201d The disciple with a bruised eye shouted out, making a lot of noise, but there was no real strength behind it.This was an extremely funny sight to behold, because the ones who were attacking were gathered in a bunch telling the one who was getting beaten to not come over. While the one who was getting beaten was quite confused, covered in blood he slowly made his way over. Step by step, he walked over to the group of five.Each step was heavy, each step was tottering and unsteady, like he would collapse in the next moment. But he still walked forwards, step by step.If not for the wall behind them, the five people would keep on retreating.p.s. Wow I had a mini heart attack just then. I was logging into post this chapter, but then it went and said my details were invaild, but luckily I tried again is everything worked out. Phew. Though what was with that last bit? It suddenly turned into comedy, but it was refreshing. The five were genuinely scared of killing him and still had morals (of sorts). But they really shouldn't worry, Kai Yang is a zombie with godly luck and won't die from their hands. XDPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 \u2013 Such a big fussPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 72 \u2013 Such a big fussThe sound of several people gulping down mouthfuls of water rang out.\u201cSenior brother, what should we do?\u201d Someone asked nervously from amongst the bunch, because he feared that if they continued to beat Kai Yang, he would die.\u201cMy lord, he is a freak!\u201d The qi transforming staged disciple swore as his eyelids flickered and he clenched his teeth before replying, \u201cWe can\u2019t care about that anymore. If he comes over, we shall attack! This time, we must knock him unconscious!\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d The remaining four replied a bit begrudgingly.Just as these five were being extremely alert, a great sense of foreboding arose in their hearts. Immediately the temperature within the room dropped by several degrees.Cracking sounds echoed throughout the room. The five people turned their heads to look and saw that on all four walls was a thin layer of ice.\u201cWhat is happening?\u201d One person asked questioningly, before immediately shivering.\u201cBoom\u201d rang out as the room\u2019s door was kicked open by someone.\u201cWho is it!\u201d The qi transforming staged Disciplinary Disciple called. Turning around his mouth became as large as a duck\u2019s egg, and no matter what, he couldn\u2019t muster the strength to close it.Although the temperature within the room was rapidly decreasing, a thin layer of cold sweat still appeared on that person\u2019s forehead as he gazed at the female at the door. Stammering, he said: \u201cSenior\u2026\u2026.Senior sister Su Yan!\u201d\u201cSenior Sister Su Yan?\u201d The four other\u2019s expressions changed greatly.Looking over, there was a stunning beauty with a cold and indifferent expression, wearing white robes standing there.She was like a never dying, never ageing, eternally blooming snow lotus on the mountain top, carrying with her a biting cold as she descended to the mortal realm; she was that noble, that cold. As her beautiful eyes swept across the room, the five disciples felt greatly inferior to her and unconsciously lowered their heads.Su Yan had hurriedly rushed all the way from Black Wind Market over to the Forest Prison. Thinking that Su Mu was entrapped here, she charged in, but felt traces of a battle occurring here, so she had rushed here instead.Opening the door, the sight she beheld her made her heart slightly shiver.(TL: Opening the door\u2026\u2026\ud83d\ude12, you kicked it open hun. ED: Violent women, what's new in this story?)Inside the room were six people, five were Disciplinary Hall disciples, with one at the qi transforming second stage and the rest at the initial element ** stages. The other person covered in blood and dirty rags, shaking and stumbling yet within his eyes, was a strong gaze of refusal to yield.This person\u2026\u2026.she had met before!Kai Yang! Su Mu had brought him over to Black Wind Trade once, he was the Trial Disciple that had defeated Cheng Shao Feng!Sending out her divine sense to examine the scene, Su Yan was stunned. Examining Kai Yang, she discovered that he was full of injuries; although those injuries weren\u2019t enough to take his life, but with his strength it was impossible to him to remain standing and conscious.How strong was his willpower in order to remain standing and not fall?In this short while, Su Yan had understood what had more or less occurred in this room. Rarely did emotions ripple in her heart, but this time she was slightly angered.With a flash, Su Yan appeared at the side of Kai Yang to support him. Sending out her ice-cold World Qi, she controlled his injuries inside and outside of his body.If you thought about it, it was slightly strange. That was because as soon as the ice cold energy entered his body, the fiery energy in his body receded and his fuzzy mind became much clearer.A pure and crisp aroma lingered at the edge of his nose, Kai Yang turned his head to look at Su Yan, his fierce expression gradually disappeared.It was like he was sitting on a snowy mountain, all he felt was cool and crisp breeze, eliminating all noises and shapes from the outside world. With her at his side, Kai Yang couldn\u2019t help but think of taking her hand and living in seclusion with her.\u201cWho attacked him?\u201d Su Yan calmly asked them in her cold voice.The five Disciplinary Disciples trembled as they looked at each other. Heads lowered they said: \u201cWe all had.\u201dIn front of Su Yan, to lie to her was sullying and pouring dirt on her. That nobility and grandeur, caused all of them to speak the truth in front of her.Su Yan nodded her head slightly: \u201cVery good!\u201dSaying this, she supported Kai Yang and step by step she walked out of the room.It wasn\u2019t until Su Yan\u2019s figure could no longer be seen, that the five gasped for breath. By then, they felt as if they had escaped a great calamity.But before the five of them could rejoice, they suddenly felt great fear. Looking at the doorway, they saw a small patch of ice that had expanded quickly to the size of a palm. This palm sized piece of ice was in the shape of a snowflake.\u201cPa\u201d rang out as five snowflakes disintegrated. Following this, the five disciples dropped to the ground in pain as they felt their World Qi disappear along with the destruction of the snowflakes. Along with their World Qi\u2019s disappearance, they all suffered numerous wounds.\u201cSo powerful! Worthy of the title of number one!\u201d The qi transforming staged Disciplinary Disciple\u2019s face paled with fear as he trembled from the cold.He was completely unable to see how Su Yan was able to attack. Without any notice she had planted her attack.If it wasn\u2019t because the Senior Sister was so calm, it wouldn\u2019t be as easy as receiving a few light wounds. With her strength, if she really wanted to take their lives, it would be as simple as pinching and breaking snail shells.Outside the room, Kai Yang was still walking with staggering steps. Hearing the sounds behind him, he turned his head in amazement towards Su Yan: \u201cYou have attacked them?\u201dSu Yan\u2019s long eyelashes blinked: \u201cEn. You\u2019re fine right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Kai Yang nodded his head, \u201cOh right, go and free Li Yun Tian and the others.\u201d\u201cWhat about Su Mu?\u201d Su Yan asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Kai Yang slowly nodded his head, \u201cHe hadn\u2019t been locked up. He has probably been sent back, as those people didn\u2019t dare to make a move on Su Mu.\u201dHearing this, Su Yan finally let out a breath of relief.The two people swiftly walked deep into the Forest Prison. Not long after, they arrived at the cell in which Li Yun Tian and the rest were imprisoned. Seeing Kai Yang and Su Yan arm in arm, and with such intimacy shocked them to no end. On the spot their eyes dropped to the ground and they all forgot how to breathe.Oh my god! If they could be this intimate with Senior Sister Su, even if they died, they would be satisfied! Li Yun Tian and the others were jealous to death.\u201cAll of you come out.\u201d Su Yan raised her hand and broke the door\u2019s lock.\u201cOh\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d This group of people involuntarily let out gasps and stupidly walked out. Ten pairs of eyes all were fixed on Kai Yang and Su Yan\u2019s figures.No matter how collected Su Yan\u2019s expression was, being watched by them like this, she couldn\u2019t help but become a bit stiff.\u201cCome, I\u2019ll take you guys out.\u201d Su Yan continued with her cold but beautiful face. Supporting Kai Yang, she walked at the front while Li Yun Tian and the rest followed behind them.Not long after, this group of people walked out of the Forest Prison. As they walked out, the sun\u2019s bright rays assaulted their eyes, causing them to narrow their eyes. As they did, around one hundred Disciplinary Hall Disciples greeted and surrounded them.\u201cSuch a big fuss!\u201d Kai Yang coldly called out, \u201cSenior Sister, this is probably catered to counter you right?\u201dSu Yan didn\u2019t answer. She only swept her eyes across the group of people, she continued to support Kai Yang and advance forward.No one dared to block their way. All of the Disciplinary Hall Disciples in their way scattered with fear in their eyes, in their eyes, automatically moving to the side and making way.p.s. Another chapter out and another chapter closer in Su Yan's and Kai Yang's relationship~~~ Hmm, she is being especially close with Kai Yang :3. Thanks for all your support.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 \u2013 Junior sister\u2019s sincerity towards mePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 73 \u2013 Junior sister\u2019s sincerity towards meAll eyes gradually converged on Su Yan and Kai Yang, whom she was supporting. Their gazes, within which traces of envy and jealousy could be seen, were accompanied by a sour atmosphere.Before that moment, they had never seen Su Yan be intimate with a male. Even those outstanding Core Disciples had never received such attention.What Su Yan cultivated was the Ice Heart Secrets. With her heart frozen these many years, even usually when she talked to males who were close to her, she was still quite cold.Every Sky Tower disciple, no matter how powerful they were, no matter how high their status, everyone of them had to be extremely careful around her, to make sure as to not offend this beauty in any way. But now, she actually took the initiative to support a youth only at the initial element third stage. Her white as jade hands rested on his waist, while her icy face was tinted a light shade of red, accentuating her beauty.This originally hard to reach person, seemed far more approachable now.All of these male Sky Tower disciples\u2019 hearts all shattered. This was because their untouchable goddess seemed as if she was being sullied by her contact with mere mortals.The person who had sullied their goddess was standing right in front of them. He was being supported by their goddess, smelling their goddess\u2019 scent, feeling the softness of the goddess\u2019 hands and enjoying treatment that none of them would dream of enjoying!\u201cThere is murderous intent!\u201d The corners of Kai Yang\u2019s mouth turned up forming an unusual smile. And as Su Yan strode forwards, he followed like a fox exploiting the tiger\u2019s might, grinning.Walking confidently in front of these people, a petite looking male was standing in Su Yan and Kai Yang\u2019s way. Within that person\u2019s gaze was sweetness and tenderness with subtle hints of jealousy and unhappiness.Su Yan suddenly stopped, lifting up her head to look at him.\u201cMove aside!\u201d Her cold voice rang out. It was dull and unfeeling, leaving one unable to sense any of the speaker\u2019s emotions.The male bitterly smiled, shaking his head: \u201cJunior sister, please don\u2019t make things difficult for this senior brother. This Senior brother is only doing his duty!\u201dThis was Sky Tower\u2019s number two expert, Xie Hong Chen.\u201cMove aside!\u201d Su Yan repeated these words, unwilling to say another word to that person.Xie Hong Chen helplessly said: \u201cJunior sister, these people cannot leave right now! They have offended Zong Gui, and the Grand Elder has said previously that no one can take them away from here. \u201d\u201cZong Gui?\u201d Kai Yang took a step forward with a sneer, \u201cI dare ask who is this senior brother. Which Zong Gui have I offended?\u201dXie Hong Chen looked at him with a gaze full of disgust and snorted out: \u201cGathering to fight a gang fight, killed a person and disrespecting Disciplinary Disciples. Any one of these would be enough to expel you from Sky Tower.\u201d\u201cGathering to fight?\u201d Su Yan spoke out, \u201cFight with who? Since it was a gang fight, there should be an opponent right? So why did your Disciplinary Hall only restrain one side? Where are the other culprits?\u201dXie Hong Chen\u2019s expression was priceless as he was left speechless. The other side was naturally Wei Zhuan\u2019s underlings, so how could they dare to restrain them.\u201cKilled someone? Where is that person\u2019s corpse?\u201dXie Hong Chen forced out a smile and immediately went to explain: \u201cAttempted, attempted to kill someone, but luckily he was stopped in time by our Disciplinary Hall. We avoided a bad outcome.\u201d\u201cThe life and death of disciples in the Main Gate while they are comparing notes is a matter for the disciples themselves to manage! If it was to be managed according to your words, then every disciple that compares notes would be attempting to commit murder? Then all of the Disciplinary Disciples would be running all across Sky Tower to imprison every disciple right?\u201d Su Yan\u2019s expression was unsympathetic, her tone ice-cold: \u201cWhat else was there, disrespecting Disciplinary Disciples, if you Disciplinary Disciples can really be just and fair, then who would disrespect you? This person who is supposed to represent Zong Gui has long since fallen and become a mere tool in a power struggle, extinguishing his own dignity. No wonder he is stepped on!\u201d\u201cJunior sister.\u201d Xie Hong Chen\u2019s smile was extremely dry and tart, he was looking helpless beyond compare, \u201cDo you really need to speak so frankly?\u201d\u201cTrue or false, you know which is which in your heart.\u201dXie Hong Chen\u2019s expression dimmed and he said in a low voice: \u201cJunior Sister, I have accepted your sincerity to me, so why are you still making things difficult for me?\u201dSu Yan indifferently responded: \u201cIf Senior brother\u2019s words were heard by Zhao Fei Xue, junior sister Zhao, how do you think she will feel?\u201dZhao Fei Xue, like Xie Hong Chen and Su Yan was a Core Disciple of Sky Tower. But this female\u2019s relationship with Xie Hong Chen was unclear.Xie Hong Chen\u2019s entire body shook, looking at Su Yan his gaze was filled with grief as he lamented his current situation, but he was left with no way out. Moving his gaze, he glared at Kai Yang, directing all of his complaints to him.Kai Yang was still calm, showing no fear towards him.\u201cYou are called Kai Yang?\u201d Xie Hong Chen forcibly suppressed his inner grievances and asked. Any male who saw the girl he liked supporting and being intimate with another male, who wouldn\u2019t feel anguish.\u201cHow will senior brother enlighten me?\u201d\u201cI know that these events were caused by you. If not for you, then there wouldn\u2019t be all these inconveniences. If you don\u2019t want to pull in junior sister Su, then obediently return to your cell and save me the trouble of doing it myself.\u201d Xie Hong Chen indifferently said. He couldn\u2019t convince Su Yan and was unable to raise his hand against Su Yan, so he could only turn towards Kai Yang.Kai Yang only smiled.\u201cWhat are you smiling about?\u201d Xie Hong Chen asked with a frown on his face.Kai Yang\u2019s entire body was covered in blood, causing his appearance to be quite appalling. As he smiled, he slowly took Su Yan\u2019s jade like hand that was on his waist. Taking it into the palm of his hand, he slowly patted her hand and turned his head towards Su Yan and said in a very sweet tone: \u201cI also don\u2019t want to implicate senior sister, but senior sister\u2019s sincerity I have received. I really can\u2019t fail to live up to that so I can only allow her to do whatever she wants.\u201dXie Hong Chen\u2019s expression paled meanwhile Su Yan remained stationary, as if she was rooted to the spot, her face perplexed.The jaws of Li Yun Tian and the rest fell to the ground and from within their throats, emerged a strange creaking sound. But no matter what, they couldn\u2019t say a single word.While the surrounding hundred or so Disciplinary Disciples only felt that each of their hearts had been split open. Each and everyone of them was left dumbstruck!\u201cSenior sister, aren\u2019t I right?\u201d Kai Yang didn\u2019t seem to take in the critical state of things and still poured salt into the wound.Xie Hong Chen looked towards Su Yan with extreme nervousness, unwilling to hear an answer that he didn\u2019t like.Su Yan suddenly turned her body around.Despite growing this old, she had never been treated this way by a male before, her hand was actually held within his and being wantonly felt. That coarse hand with callouses rubbing against her skin continuously felt painful yet warm.Su Yan was extremely angry! Turning around, she wanted to send Kai Yang flying, but looking at him, she understood what he wanted to do. Suppressing her urge to hit him, Su Yan faintly nodded her head and honestly said: \u201cYes!While she responded, she formed a stream of energy and sent it into Kai Yang\u2019s meridians.Kai Yang suddenly groaned and from his nostrils came two streams of blood.\u201cWhy did you start to bleed?\u201d While she said this, Su Yan also went to take out a silk cloth before tenderly wiping away the blood for Kai Yang.\u201cI can do it, I can do it!\u201d A cold shiver came out from Kai Yang\u2019s heart. Although this senior sister looked indifferent, he knew that if he touched her bottom line, then he would die ruthlessly under her hand.\u201cYou guys\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Xie Hong Chen called out madly in jealousy. If previously he didn\u2019t want to believe Su Yan\u2019s words, now seeing that scene, he couldn\u2019t help but question her feelings.Had he ever seen Su Yan treat a male this tenderly and gently before? Had he ever seen Su Yan\u2019s hand in another male\u2019s hand without any resistance or reluctance?It looked like she was really happy and willing. But with Su Yan\u2019s strength, how could Kai Yang win her over?\u201cJunior sister, you were born with privilege, how could you possibly take fancy to such trash?\u201d\u201cWho are you calling trash?\u201d Both Kai Yang and Su Yan simultaneously turned their heads; their expressions like raging tempests.p.s. Woo another chapter is out and potential wifey 2 is on the waaay~ Hook, line and sinker! \ud83d\ude09Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 \u2013 The Head enters the discussionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 74 \u2013 The Head enters the discussionLike they had planned this beforehand, like they shared the same mind, Kai Yang and Su Yan yelled out the same words. Even the tone and attitude with which they yelled at Xie Hong Chen was the same.Xie Hong Chen became wholly stunned by their shout! Looking at Su Yan, his gaze full of pain, he miserably said: \u201cHow is he not trash? His status is merely that of a Trial Disciple and his cultivation is only at the initial element third stage. These type of people are clearly trash. Junior sister, what could you possibly see in him?\u201d\u201cYou need not worry about our affairs!\u201d Su Yan was such a great actress, taking full advantage of this opportunity to rid herself of Xie Hong Chen\u2019s nagging which she had suffered from all these years. She even used such intimate sounding words.\u201cSenior brother, do you know the phrase \u2018love at first sight\u2019?\u201d Kai Yang said to Xie Hong Chen with a bit of ridicule.\u201cYou shut up!\u201d His expression dark, Xie Hong Chen shouted at Kai Yang, \u201cI am talking with my junior sister, so how are you qualified to interrupt?\u201dKai Yang\u2019s eyes narrowed and he laughed out loud.\u201cTrash is trash!\u201d Xie Hong Chen had long since cast him away to god knows where. His handsome face contorted, unsightly as it could be, \u201cWhen I was your age, I was already at the qi transforming stage, while you are still only at the initial element third stage. Where as now, I am at the peak of the separation and reunion boundary. We have an entire two realm gap, with this how can you compare to me?\u201d\u201cSenior brother please wait and see!\u201d Kai Yang didn\u2019t waste words because some things couldn\u2019t be explained, you could only do them to make others understand.\u201cXie Hong Chen, I don\u2019t want to tangle with you any further. Move aside, under the care of your Disciplinary Hall, he has suffered no small amount. I need to take him back to tend to his injuries!\u201d Su Yan\u2019s cold voice rang out.\u201cToday, no one shall be able to leave here!\u201d Xie Hong Chen\u2019s voice bellowed out. Looking at Su Yan with pain in his eyes, his entire body shook as he sent out the command: \u201cListen here Disciplinary Hall Disciples, no matter who tries to dash out, attack to kill! This is even more prevalent with regard to senior sister Su, you musn\u2019t be lenient with her.\u201dLove, hate, no matter which emotion, at that very hour, Xie Hong Chen expressed his meaning clearly.Hua hua hua\u2026\u2026after hesitating for a while, the hundred or so Disciplinary Disciples rushed forwards to engage. Once again, these disciples surrounded Su Yan\u2019s group.\u201cYou are determined to do this?\u201d From within Su Yan\u2019s pair of crystal clear eyes, flashed a dangerous streak of light.Xie Hong Chen forced out a bitter smile: \u201cJunior sister, I know that I am not your opponent. But if you really want to pass me forcibly today, then you will need to pass over my dead body!\u201dSince he was pushed to this point, he tried to use his courage and helplessness to move Su Yan.Su Yan was so angered, her chest heaved up and down non-stop!She didn\u2019t fear the Disciplinary Hall Disciples, after all, her strength was at the true element third stage. She was higher than Xie Hong Chen by three small stages and as soon as she used her Ice Heart Secrets, no one would be able to block her path.But\u2026\u2026Kai Yang and Li Yun Tian\u2019s group were destined to not have such an easy time.After all, she was only one person and couldn\u2019t possibly protect everyone under her wing.Currently, they were in a deadlock because Su Yan didn\u2019t dare to forcibly try to bring her group of people out, while the Disciplinary Disciples didn\u2019t dare to initiate any attacks. Thus they remained stationary in their current positions.Just as this group of the younger generation was causing such a large fuss, the Sky Tower Elders were having an earth shaking argument in another part of the school.In the Elders Hall, Sky Tower\u2019s Grand Elder Wei Xi Tong, the Second Elder Su Xuan Wu, the Third Elder He Bei Shui, the Fourth Elder Zhou Fei and the Fifth Elder You Zi Zai had all gathered.The five major elders sat in two opposing groups, one group was lead by the Grand Elder Wei Xi along with the Fourth Elder Zhou Fei and the Fifth Elder You Zi Zai sitting behind him.Similarly on the other side, sat the Second Elder Su Xuan Wu and the Third Elder He Bei Shui.This represented the current Elder factions within Sky Tower.The previously clashing Wei Zhuan and Su Mu were kneeling on the ground on their respective sides and narrated the things that had occurred earlier in the day.Su Mu was the first one to speak and he spoke the truth, how he was first blocked and how he was first provoked. Also how he was humiliated when they were comparing notes, though regardless of the importance, he didn\u2019t add any personal opinions.After he finished the five Elders sat and didn\u2019t say a word, only waiting for Wei Zhuan to narrate.But when it came from his mouth, things didn\u2019t quite match up with what Su Mu had said. Although it was about the same with regards to the beginning, but once he got to the moment Kia Yang appeared he started to veer off. His tongue like silver, accompanied by mucus and tears, he tearfully cried out about how overboard Kai Yang acted and how he had a Treasure Weapon which he used to attack and destroy his Embroidered Cloud Locking Mail and how he had attempted to kill him.With such a miserable tone, his heart wrenching narration would be enough to bring his listeners to tears; just like a TV drama with its dramatic body language, he exaggerated the events by a hundredfold.\u201cYou are lying!\u201d Listening to this, Su Mu was indignant and couldn\u2019t help by cry out.\u201cThe truth is exactly so!\u201d Wei Zhuan took the opportunity to embellish because Su Mu had been unconscious while the situation had played out, insisting on his truth.\u201cThe truth my ass! You make a fuss out of nothing, you rumor starting and deceiving piece of trash! You don\u2019t even need a script to lie.\u201d\u201cSilence, all of you!\u201d The Grand Elder repeatedly slapped his chair. Su Mu actually dared to curse his grandson like this in front of him, so how could he remain calm? But anger can only be anger, for it wasn\u2019t appropriate for him to intervene in the disputes between the younger generation.\u201cHumph!\u201d The Second Elder coldly snorted out.The Grand Elder asked: \u201cBoth side have said their parts, my fellow Elders, how do you view this?\u201dAlthough he had worded it like so, his eyes never left the Second Elder Su Xuan Wu as he wanted to know his opinion.Su Xuan Wu responded: \u201cWhat how do we view it? Isn\u2019t it already extremely clear? The disputes between the younger generation and their duels should be settled amongst themselves. Why should us Elders be involved?\u201dThe Grand Elder chuckled slightly, while the Fourth Elder Zhou Fei went to back up the Grand Elder: \u201cSecond brother, what you said isn\u2019t correct. Originally the situation should have been settled amongst the younger generation in their duels, but since that Kai Yang came, he caused a disturbance and complicated things.\u201d\u201cHow so? Under the eyes of everyone, he openly challenged Wei Zhuan to a duel and didn\u2019t break any Main Gate rules. Wei Zhuan\u2019s personal strength wasn\u2019t sufficient, so if he was defeated, who is he to blame?\u201d Su Xuan Wu was furious that his own grandson had been humiliated, so his tone naturally wouldn\u2019t be courteous.The Fourth Elder opened his mouth to speak: \u201cIf he really just challenged Wei Zhuan to compare notes then defeated him, then there wouldn\u2019t be any problems! But during the battle, he had taken out a weapon and used that weapon to break Wei Zhuan\u2019s Embroidered Cloud Locking Mail. The head has said, that in battles between fellow disciples, one is unable to use weapons! That Kai Yang has clearly broken this rule, and should naturally receive the appropriate punishment!\u201dSu Xuan Wu laughed sarcastically: \u201cOld Four, the Head didn\u2019t set any rules like that right? With the Head in seclusion these many years, someone has actually dared to change his rules?\u201dThus clearly pointing fingers and hearing this, the Grand Elder was greatly moved. Wei Xi Tong said: \u201cOh? Then Second Brother, please tell us what the Head had said exactly?\u201dSu Xuan Wu sneered: \u201cThe Head said, that in the duels between disciples, disciples are not to use weapons, nor to use strength enhancing immortality pills nor Secret Artifacts! For duels, disciples are only able to use their own martials skills and fists! Big brother, this, I haven\u2019t said incorrectly right?\u201dThe Grand Elder\u2019s face turned grim, nodding his head he replied: \u201cThat is correct!\u201dp.s. Sorry of the momentary blank of chapters. My school decided to be an ass and told us to start last Friday, :/ I know. So today was my first official day, and this Friday I already have a test on polynomials, yay\u2026\u2026\u2026 Anyway, the first chapter of the week!

    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75-76 \u2013 All Hail Treasurer MengPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 75-76 \u2013 All Hail Treasurer Meng\u201cThat\u2019s right then!\u201d Su Xuan Wu laughed non stop, \u201cIn the duel between Wei Zhuan and Su Mu, why was he wearing a defensive artifact? Is this not breaking the Main Gate rules? How should we handle this?\u201dHe didn\u2019t ask about Kai Yang first, but went to rope in Wei Zhuan first, causing the Grand Elder to stare blankly at him, unable to respond.\u201cIf Wei Zhuan really used his own skill to win against Su Mu, then it\u2019s no wonder for Su Mu\u2019s loss. But since Wei Zhuan was under the protection of his defensive artifact and used that protection to humiliate my grandson, First brother how can this be endured?\u201d Su Xuan Wu bellowed out in fury as he slammed his palm down on the arm of his chair, turning it into smithereens.Wei Xi Tong couldn\u2019t help but lower himself: \u201cSecond brother, please quell your anger. Wei Zhuan\u2019s defensive artifact was given to him by myself, but that was only because I wanted to make sure he would be safe. But he was like a child and actually used the artifact\u2019s power to duel with others. This was Wei Zhuan\u2019s fault.\u201dRight after this, an angry voice immediately sounded out: \u201cWei Zhuan, why haven\u2019t you apologised and admitted your wrongdoings to your senior brother Su yet?\u201dWei Zhuan was extremely clever and immediately cupped his hands towards Su Mu, saying: \u201cSenior Su, this time it was this junior brother\u2019s fault and he says his apologies to you. Senior brother, you are a great person with great forgiveness, so please don\u2019t care about my wrongdoings!\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201d Su Mu overexaggerated his disregard.But since things had reached this point, how could Su Xuan Wu say anything else?The Grand Elder said: \u201cWei Zhuan was wrong, but Kai Yang committed a bigger violation of the rules. With a divine weapon in hand, he threatened to kill Wei Zhuan. If not for the Disciplinary Hall Disciples timely intervention, then I\u2019m afraid that Wei Zhuan would have lost his life already. This was done with extremely evil intentions, so Kai Yang must be punished accordingly and used as an example to others.\u201dThe Fourth Elder Zhou Fei and the Fifth Elder You Zi Zai both nodded their heads in agreement.However the Second Elder laughed out coldly: \u201cWei Zhuan broke the rules and only needed to apologise to be forgiven, meanwhile Kai Yang needs to suffer the punishment? Could it be because Wei Zhuan is your grandson first brother, so he can have special privileges? If this is the case, then how would our great Elder Council have any reputation and prestige in Sky Tower?\u201dWei Xi Tong\u2019s face turned grim: \u201cSecond brother, your words are piercing. Kai Yang\u2019s wrongdoings and Wei Zhuan\u2019s wrongdoings cannot be put on the same level. Wei Zhuan only wore a defensive artifact to protect himself, not to hurt others. While Kai Yang\u2019s weapon was used for attempted murder and could be used at anytime in the future, so second brother you should be able to see the differences!\u201dSu Xuan Wu replied: \u201cI dare to ask first brother, who has seen Kai Yang with this so called treasure? If this weapon really existed, then why couldn\u2019t the Disciplinary Hall Disciples confiscate it or find it on Kai Yang\u2019s body? Old Four, did your Disciplinary Hall report of anything similar to that being found?\u201dThe Disciplinary Hall came under the jurisdiction of the Fourth Elder Zhou Fei. When he was addressed, he merely shook his head and said: \u201cAlthough it wasn\u2019t found, under the eyes of the many disciples present, they all saw Kai Yang holding a blood red blade, this is the undeniable truth.\u201dSu Xuan Wu laughed coldly, and then using his World Qi, he formed a long and slender blade comprised completely of World Qi. Although it\u2019s form flickered, you could still feel its power and majesty.\u201cIf this was the case, then am I not also in possession of a weapon?\u201d Su Xuan Wu laughed mockingly, looking at the three opposing people facing him.\u201cThis is only the fine use of World Qi, how could it be considered as a weapon?\u201d The Fifth Elder You Zi Zai shook his head faintly.\u201cSecond brother means that Kai Yang who is only at the initial element third stage can already use his World Qi to this extent?\u201d The Fourth Elder Zhou Fei looked at Su Xuan Wu with a smile, that was not a smile.These words were such a joke. Because only when a martial practitioner reached the true element stage, and their World Qi became True Qi, were they able to form their Qi into a solid substance. While Kai Yang was only at the initial element third stage and the distance between it and the true element stage was like a thousand and eight hundred li. How could he have this ability?\u201cI didn\u2019t say that his control over his World Qi had reached such a state, but have my fellow brothers forgotten martial skills can also make this possible?\u201d Su Xuan Wu snorted out.\u201cImpossible. Even if he used such a peculiar martial skill, a mere initial element third stage martial practitioner cannot possibly destroy the Embroidered Cloud Locking Mail.\u201d Wei Xi Tong replied while repeatedly shaking his head.\u201cThere is nothing impossible in this world. It can only be that my fellow brothers have been far too busy snatching power these past years that you simply cannot keep up with the times!\u201dThese words were slightly unpleasant to hear, and Wei Xi Tong\u2019s face immediately turned cold: \u201cSecond, are you really insisting on protecting that Kai Yang?\u201d\u201cSo what if I am!\u201d Su Xuan Wu suddenly stood up, \u201cThese affairs this time, in simple terms, it is only a duel between the younger generations, but you insisted on causing such a fuss. Since you insist, then I shall humor your endless pestering. You either punish both Kai Yang and Wei Zhuan, because they have both broken the Main Gate rules, sparing neither. Or this matter will be considered settled and no one shall pursue this matter any further.\u201d\u201cThat cannot do!\u201d Wei Xi Tong rebuked this proposal in one go, \u201cIf it is as you say, then Kai Yang really used a weapon to break the Embroidered Cloud Locking Mail. But at such a young age, he is already this ruthless, so in the future he will definitely stray off onto the wrong path. My Sky Tower Pavilion cannot have such people!\u201d\u201cHe is only at the initial element stage, how are you to know whether or not he will fall into depravity in the future? Could it be that first brother can foresee the future?\u201d\u201cSecond brother\u2026\u2026.\u201d Just as the Fourth Elder Zhou Fei was about to say something, he was cut short by a rage filled shout from Su Xuan Wu. Pointing his finger at Zhou Fei\u2019s nose, he cursed him: \u201cOld Four, before the Head went into seclusion, he left you in charge of the Disciplinary Hall. And in these past years, let\u2019s see and what the Disciplinary Hall has done? Fair and just, when have they been so? If the Disciplinary Hall can only suppress disciples and enter a power struggle, then what use is it to you? Tomorrow I shall go to the Head and ask him to strip you of your Disciplinary Hall duties! What a show!\u201dThe Fourth Elder cursed till his eyes started to twitch in fury, but he couldn\u2019t refute anything he had said and could only feel wronged inside.\u201cSecond brother, what if I am adamant about expelling Kai Yang from Sky Tower?\u201d Wei Xi Tong asked, his face devoid of warmth.\u201cYou dare!\u201d Su Xuan Wu didn\u2019t back down.\u201cFine, then we shall follow those rules that the Head had set, and decide by vote. If the Grand Elder\u2019s opinion wins, then second brother should have no objections right?\u201d\u201cHe he, raising your hand and voting?\u201d Su Xuan Wu laughed loudly, \u201cFirst brother, you don\u2019t really think that I, Su Xuan Wu, am an idiot right? To vote by raising your hand, is there any need for it?\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t good, that isn\u2019t good, then what will satisfy you? Are you not even putting the Head\u2019s rules in your eyes.\u201d Through this quarrelling, Wei Xi Tong had also been angered.From within the Elder Hall, smoke was rising, so much so that it was about burst out.\u201cCalm yourselves, all of you calm yourselves and come and drink a cup of tea. Everyone, cool your heads.\u201d The Third Elder who had yet to say anything, finally intervened and advised them all to not act rashly.The Third Elder was gentle in nature, and though he stood on the side of the Second Elder, he didn\u2019t intervene in any of the disputes. Not to mention that his name is the exact same as his catchphrase, He Bei Shui, drink a cup of tea!As soon as there was any friction between the Elders, he always mediated between them like this. It was just that the results weren\u2019t very big.\u201cI won\u2019t drink!\u201d Both the First Elder and Second Elder bellowed out at the same time, looking at each other with distaste, refusing to comply with each other.The Third Elder was left helpless and could only continue to enjoy it himself.Justs as the Elders were arguing and causing a ruckus, a person\u2019s voice sounded out from outside the door: \u201cThis disciple has some important information he needs to inform the Elders about!\u201dThe Fourth Elder\u2019s eyebrows immediately crinkled together and he promptly said: \u201cCome in!\u201dWhile the Elders were discussing things, disciples didn\u2019t dare disturb them. Since someone came to disturb them, it must be something important regarding Sky Tower.When the Elders were informed of this, they momentarily stopped their quarrels.When that disciple walked in, the Fourth Eler Zhou Fei asked: \u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d\u201cReporting to the Elders, someone has forcibly charged into the Sky Tower Forest Prison and saved the ruckus causing Kai Yang, Li Yun Tian and the\u201cWhat?\u201d The Fourth Elder immediately stood up on the spot, while the other Elders were also equally startled.\u201cWho is the one who is so daring, that they dared to charge into the Forest Prison to save them?\u201dThat Sky Tower disciple didn\u2019t dare to reply and could only lift up his head and stare timidly.Su Xuan Wu\u2019s heart thumped and he suddenly had a bad premonition.From all of this, the Grand Elder could work out what had happened and he immediately calmed down before instructing the disciple: \u201cYou, speak.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u2026.it\u2019s Su Yan, senior sister Su!\u201dOnce those words were spoken, the Grand Elder\u2019s smile expanded greatly. More importantly, even the Fourth Elder and Fifth Elder looked at Su Xuan Wu weirdly, while the Third Elder continued to drink his tea.Su Xuan Wu\u2019s expression changed non-stop, angered to point he couldn\u2019t stop grinding his teeth together, he shouted: \u201cDid you see clearly? That person who had charged into the Forest Prison really was Su Yan?\u201dThat Disciplinary Disciple was so scared that he trembled non-stop, and replied at once: \u201cThis disciple saw it as clear as day. I clearly know of senior sister Su Yan\u2019s name and fame and if the Second Elder doesn\u2019t believe me, then you may make a trip to see for yourself!\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Su Xuan Wu waved his hand and went on a spiritual journey. A short while later he had arrived at the Forest Prison and felt an ice cold chill. This type of chill, apart from Su Yan, no one else in the entire Sky Tower possessed it.This girl really didn\u2019t know of the severity of the situation, too reckless!\u201cSecond brother, how would you view this situation?\u201d The Grand Elder asked with an extremely large smile, holding his cup of tea as he waited for him to come back to his body. He was calm and unruffled as he asked.At that moment, the Grand Elder was quite calm.If both sides were refusing to allow each other to win, then this event would be the key allowing a side to win.What type of place is the Forest Prison! That was the place where disciples who had committed wrongdoings were placed in Sky Tower! No matter if Kai Yang hadn\u2019t committed any wrongdoings, if he was locked in there, until a proper resolution had been made, he could not leave.But now it was great, Su Yan had stormed the place and forcibly tried to take him away. A spur of the moment decision, the result was that she had gone and broken a major rule in Sky Tower!If this wasn\u2019t properly taken care of, even Su Yan would have to be punished!Wei Xi Tong knew that Su Xuan Wu definitely wouldn\u2019t allow Su Yan to be roped in. Since this was the case, he must take a step back and give him face, but of course, that would be on the premise that he was allowed to deal with Kai Yang!Now that you think about it, none of these five elders were related to Kai Yang in any other way. Up until today, the big fuss they had caused was only for their own personal gain, fighting over the leadership of Sky Tower.Now the Grand Elder felt that he would win this battle.If this affair were to be spread out, then all of the disciples would think that his faction would be the true decision making faction in Sky Tower. And then their goal would be achieved.Su Xuan Wu\u2019s face became ashen, and his expression struggled for quite a while, before saying in a resentful tone: \u201cHowever first brother wants to deal with it, then you shall deal with it!\u201dSince Su Xuan Wu was forced to concede, how could he have the mind to quarrel with them further? In order for Su Yan not to be punished, then Kai Yang must be sacrificed.Where the hills are green, there will be wood to burn. In the future, there will always be a chance to get revenge!\u201cOld ghost!\u201d As soon as Su Mu heard those words, his eyes opened wide and looked at Su Xuan Wu in disbelief.\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d Su Xuan Wu flared up in anger like he was talking with his siblings.\u201cGrandpa! You can\u2019t be like this!\u201d Su Mu immediately corrected himself.\u201cYou have no right to say anything regarding this matter!\u201d Su Xuan Wu glared at him fiercely.\u201cSenior brother Kai has saved my life, you cannot not care about him. If you do not care about him, then that is being highly ungrateful!\u201d\u201cYou shut up!\u201d All this speaking had caused Su Xuan Wu\u2019s face to turn bright red, and although he was unwilling in a hundred different ways, he was under the knife and was fed this, what could he do?With Su Mu chattering like an insect beside him, Su Xuan Wu\u2019s hand lashed out in the air, immediately afterwards Su Mu froze like a statue, unable to move or speak only able to hear.\u201cWait until we get home for me to deal with you!\u201d Su Xuan Wu\u2019s nostrils flared with heat and anger.\u201cHe he!\u201d The Grand Elder laughed with satisfaction, \u201cSince second brother has no objections, then this shall be settled like this.\u201dFinishing, he looked at the disciple still standing there: \u201cSend down this command, the Trial Disciple Kai Yang has repeatedly broken Main Gate rules, his actions ruthless thus the Disciplinary Hall will capture and imprison him in the Forest Prison until the Head returns to decide his punishment. As for Su Yan\u2026\u2026..since she is young and ignorant, and this was also her first offense, we shall not take it too seriously. What do my fellow brothers think about it?\u201dHow could the other Elders have any objections?\u201cGo then!\u201d With a wave of his hand, a order tablet flew into that Disciplinary Hall disciples hands.The Elder Command, seeing this tablet was equivalent to seeing the person himself! With this order tablet, Su Yan would no longer dare to act recklessly.\u201cYes!\u201d That Disciplinary Hall disciple received the order and swiftly walked out.A short while later, from the direction of the door front came a bloodcurdling scream, and the sound of someone falling to the ground could be heard. The Elder\u2019s faces changed significantly, and just as they were standing up to find out what happened, a person\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cFellow Elders have such power.\u201d The voice rang out, while a thin, old man with wispy white hair walked inside. When he walked inside, he was also carrying the disciple who had just left, but he had been knocked unconscious, even the elders had been suppressed by this old man.That man walked to the kneeling Wei Zhuan and Su Mu and casually lifted up one of his legs and kicked Wei Zhuan to the side: \u201cGo go go, don\u2019t block the way!\u201dWei Zhuan\u2019s body flew out, as he wailed miserably.In the Elder Hall, all five Elder\u2019s faces were changing non-stop and Wei Xi Tong narrowed his eyes and said to the person: \u201cTreasurer Meng?\u201dThe person who had just arrived, really was the Contribution Hall\u2019s Meng Wu Ya!Speaking of this person, all five Elders were confused.Ten or so years back, this person had suddenly appeared in Sky Tower. They didn\u2019t know what relationship he had with the Head, but with this he had started to reside in Sky Tower and was in charge of the Contribution Hall. Many times, they had tried to inquire about him from the Head, but each time they were left confused and without answer.But all five Elders knew that this person was an expert! They also knew that he was below their Head.Fortunately this person had no goal and only spent his days inside the Contribution Hall, knowing his place. Because of this, they didn\u2019t pay much attention to him.But today he had come uninvited to this place.Wei Xi Tong had a faint feeling, that when he was facing this Treasurer Meng, the pressure he felt was stronger than what it was like when he was facing their Head.In the midst of his smile, Wei Xi Tong began to speak: \u201cMay I ask as to why Treasurer Meng has come to my Elder Hall?\u201dMeng Wu Ya didn\u2019t respond, he only smiled and looked at Su Xuan Wu. Su Xuan Wu was quite confused, thinking was it because his face had started to grow flowers, otherwise why would he be looking at him?\u201cYou think that your decision is correct?\u201d Meng Wu Ya suddenly questioned?\u201cWhat?\u201d Su Xuan Wu stared blankly.p.s. Phew, finally got this chapter out. I apologise for the lack of chapters last week, because as I have previously mentioned I had a test on the first Friday back, so I had to study and prep for it a bit. T_T Also this is Monday\u2019s (yesterday\u2019s) chapter that was supposed to be released yesterday, but it got too late so I held off posting until I got some rest. Man this chapter took a long time, and half og it was bull crap about the Elders arguing, (damn author combining chapters). Until the next chapter then guys~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Martial PeakChapter 77 \u2013 Release themPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 77 \u2013 Release them\u201cSacrificing Kai Yang in order to save Su Yan, do you think your choice is correct?\u201d Treasurer Meng asked before lightly chuckling.Su Xuan Wu became greatly embarrassed and thought he had come to criticise him.Meng Wu Ya continued: \u201cIf so and you do this and really save Su Yan from her predicament, what would she think when she realises the reason for her safety?\u201dSu Xuan Wu stared ahead blankly before a beads of perspiration fell from his forehead as he realised the severity of the situation.\u201cIf you really do this, then you only create inner demons/guilt in her heart! She trains in the Ice Heart Secrets, so if these demons/guilt really appeared you more than anyone else should know of the consequences.\u201d Meng Wu Ya whispered into Su Xuan Wu\u2019s ears, while he felt like he had been struck by lightning, a feeling of great remorse arose within him.He had only thought about the short term benefits, and failed to see the disastrous long term effects it would have brought about for Su Yan. True, that by sacrificing Kai Yang he would save Su Yan, but as long as she lived every day she would think about how she was saved and how it was all from Kai Yang\u2019s hard work. After thinking about it for a long time, she would become tormented by guilt, so how would her cultivation rise?\u201cMany thanks to Treasurer Meng for his pointers!\u201d Su Xuan Wu respectfully responded.\u201cHa ha.\u201d Meng Wu Ya chuckled lightly, \u201cEven if I didn\u2019t say it, you would still have thought of it. It\u2019s only that you would only have thought about it later!\u201dThe Grand Elder stood to the side, his face unreadable; after all this time, with great difficulty he had finally managed to find an advantage over his second brother, but just as things were about to come his way, Treasurer Meng appeared. With just a few words from him, how could his second brother willingly continue to raise his white flag? For Su Yan\u2019s future prospects, he definitely wouldn\u2019t concede this time.Realising this, Wei Xi Tong\u2019s face fell: \u201cTreasurer Meng, this the Elder Hall of Sky Tower, no one, even elders, without a permit cannot enter here. I suggest you return from whence you came. \u201dMeng Wu Ya merely glanced at him, backing away quietly, then his figure suddenly flashed and reappeared on the highest place in the Elder Hall.\u201cAudacious!\u201d Wei Xi Tong shouted out vigorously while the other couple of elder\u2019s faces were all sharp with anger, they were all looking at Meng Wu Ya with unkind faces.Their issue wasn\u2019t with him personally, but was due to the fact that seat belonged to the Head of Sky Tower and apart from the Head, no one else held the qualifications to be there. Even though these fellow elders had been struggling with each other over the years, not even the Grand Elder dared to occupy that position.But now, a mere treasurer of the Contribution Hall of unknown origins dared to go to that place. How could these fellow elders not be angry? This was insulting the entire Sky Tower!\u201cHe he, everyone, please don\u2019t get angry.\u201d Meng Wu Ya laughed indifferently, and while stroking his beard he said: \u201cI am here representing your Head and am only here to pass on a message!\u201d\u201cRepresenting the Head?\u201d The five elders shouted at the same time.In recent years, even if it were the five elders who wanted to meet him, it was equivalent to reaching for the skies, they wouldn\u2019t have thought that Treasurer Meng would have been able to meet him. And by his tone, it seemed that because of today\u2019s events, he had some things he wanted to say.What is this all about? On a ordinary day, even if things flipped upside down, the Head wouldn\u2019t intervene. So why did he intervene when it was just a small dispute been the younger generations?\u201cWhat is this, you should all recognise this right?\u201d Within Meng Wu Ya\u2019s hand, was a purple coloured jade pendant.\u201cThe pendant of the Head!\u201dThis jade pendant was the symbol of Sky Tower Pavilion, and was absolutely impossible to be counterfeited.\u201cSince you know, that\u2019s good.\u201d Meng Wu Ya smiled softly.Wei Xi Tong asked in a pondering tone: \u201cMay I dare to ask what instructions did the Head want you to pass on?\u201dEven though it had been ten years since the Head had managed any of the affairs relating to Sky Tower, the prestige and power of his position hadn\u2019t weakened a bit.Meng Wu Ya replied: \u201cYour Head said, you have made big things become small and small things become big, all these things are because of name of the people involved! As the older generation, are you not ashamed to intervene in the problems of the younger generations? You are a bit too shameless.\u201dWei Xi Tong was shocked and finally spoke after a long period of time: \u201cThe Head\u2026\u2026\u2026The Head really said that?\u201d\u201cOh, that last part was my words. Your Head only said the first half!\u201d Meng Wu Ya replied indifferently.The five elders were angered to the point that they wanted to spit blood! This scolding, really strong! This really wasn\u2019t a good one.\u201cAlso, Kai Yang has already entered the initial element stage, so he should be promoted to being an Ordinary Disciple. Afterall, continuing to have his Trial Disciple status isn\u2019t a good thing.\u201d\u201cThis, this is also your words?\u201d Wei Xi Tong asked with quite a lot of doubt.\u201cThis was said by your Head.\u201d Meng Wu Ya laughed a good amount, \u201cSince I have transmitted these words already, then I shall leave you all now.\u201dWith these words, he began walking down from the position.The five elders all looked at each other, and signalled each other with their eyes. Since the Head had already given his words, what else is left to discuss because it wasn\u2019t really a big issue. They all caused such a fuss because of their own motives, so not pursuing, wouldn\u2019t it be a simple task?Su Xuan Wu laughed coldly and waved his hands before walking out. With the Head\u2019s commands, he no longer needed to quarrel any further and when he reached the bottom of the hall, he carried Su Mu and quickly walked away.Soon after the Second Elder had left, the Third Elder He Bei Shui also excused himself leaving only the Grand Elder\u2019s faction in the Elder Hall.The Fifth Elder You Zi Zai: \u201cFirst brother, something\u2019s not right. Today\u2019s events were not that big, yet they moved the Head. Could there be some sort of conspiracy in it?\u201dThe Fourth Elder also nodded his head in agreement: \u201cCould it be that the the Head wanted to send us a warning that he was still watching over Sky Tower?\u201dThis was also the hidden guess that the Grand Elder had made, but he just wasn\u2019t willing to admit it. Now that someone else had voiced it his heart gave a loud thump.\u201cNot matter what, we must retreat a step and in the future, no matter what, we must be careful, more careful.\u201d The Grand Elder said, muttering to himself, \u201cBut you could try and probe around for the Head\u2019s intention and see what the Head is really thinking about. See if he has any ideas about leaving seclusion and taking over Sky Tower, then I would have to become an assistant, but if he only acted on the spur of the moment\u2026\u2026..then this shouldn\u2019t continue further in Sky Tower. There should be someone who can really take charge.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! But, how should we probe about?\u201d The Fourth Elder asked softly.\u201cDidn\u2019t the Head say to promote that Kai Yang to an Ordinary Disciple? You could also gain something from that.\u201d\u201cSo it seems!\u201d Both the Fourth Elder and Fifth Elder suddenly realised.The Forest Prison, Su Yan, Xie Hong Chen and the rest were still facing off, no one daring to move.This situation had already persisted for an entire thirty minutes, the cold air around Su Yan had gotten much stronger. If not for the fact that the martial skill that Kai Yang cultivated happened to suppress her Ice Heart Secrets, he might have long since been frozen to become an ice sculpture.Just as they continued to be in a deadlock, a Disciplinary Hall Disciple came rushing over and loudly yelled out: \u201cThe Grand Elder has sent out a command, release them!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Xie Hong Chen became stupid.That Disciplinary Hall Disciple continued with a bitter look on his face: \u201cSenior brother Xie, the Elders have said already that today\u2019s matters end here and no one is to investigate any further or you\u2019ll be punished according to the School Rules!\u201dXie Hong Chen looked at Kai Yang with a venomous gaze. That was because if Su Yan had started to attack, then he could have found an excuse to take out Kai Yang! But Su Yan never gave him that opportunity, and hearing the order from the Elders, he knew that there was no longer any chance for him to take Kai Yang out.Clenching his teeth in grief, Xie Hong Chen bellowed out in rage: \u201cRelease them!\u201dSu Yan continued to support Kai Yang while slowly leading Li Yun Tian and the others outside. Under the complex gaze of Xie Hong Chen, they slowly walked away.p.s. Hey guys, second regular chapter of the week. Things got reeaaallll fast. Xie Hong Chen is d-e-v-a-s-t-a-t-e-d~. Good night then.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 77": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Martial PeakChapter 78 \u2013 Sentiment (Third part)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 78 \u2013 Sentiment (Third part)Author\u2019s note: It pains me to death\u2026..to release a chapter, I actually needed to do it three times. I don\u2019t know it is is possible, but a book once said that ten-eight-two words are able to complete things and make it harmonious. I just want to finish this chapter, otherwise I will start to spit out blood.The curtains just weirdly closed on this large-scale battle between the younger disciples. A lot of people thought it was unusual especially since it happened without an explanation.The battle this time involved many people, with the Disciplinary Hall sending over a hundred disciples to surround and stop Su Yan, which only confirmed her power.Whilst the other person involved, Kai Yang became known to many disciples, those whom were involved and those who were envious of his relationship with Su Yan. In all, there were numerous different rumors regarding him.The subject of these rumors, Kai Yang, was fast asleep.Right after leaving the Forest Prison, Kai Yang immediately went to sleep. When he was ganged up on and beaten by those five Disciplinary Hall Disciples, although they weren\u2019t serious, they were still quite harsh. If not for the dire situation at hand, Kai Yang would have long since fallen.With the situation resolved, and no worries in his heart, one would naturally be unable to continue to support themselves.When he woke up, Kai Yang found himself in an unknown bed. With his body aching all over, he looked around the room and found himself in an extremely elegant yet simple room without much furniture and in quite a secluded place.It was just like Su Yan\u2019s house in Black Wind Trade.Struggling to get up, the noise that he made alerted the people outside. So not long after, Su Mu pushed open the door with a face full of emotion.Li Yun Tian and the others were also present and as Su Mu walked in, they all looked at Kai Yang in relief.\u201cSenior brother Kai, how do you feel?\u201d Su Mu asked as he walked over to support him.\u201cI\u2019m fine now.\u201d Kai Yang started to work his World Qi and found that there were no real problems, he just needed to rest for a few days.\u201cThis time senior brother saved me, Su Mu, I thank you.\u201d Su Mu replied somewhat awkwardly.\u201cNo need to apologise.\u201d Kai Yang replied, lifting up his hand to stop him.\u201cOh right, my family\u2019s old ghost gave me this pill to give to you to help you heal and cultivate better.\u201d Su Mu took out ten bottles and placed them side by side on the bedside table.\u201cThe Second Elder?\u201d Kai Yang was amazed, \u201cIsn\u2019t this a bit too much?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not much, not much. This time you received heavy injuries, so you should properly rest and heal.\u201d\u201cThen junior brother, please help me thank the Second Elder.\u201d\u201cNo need for thanks.\u201d Su Mu waved his hand before a wave of fury appeared on his face.This time, Su Xuan Wu thought he had really treated Kai Yang badly, so that was the reason why he had bestowed him with so many immortal pills. If not for Treasurer Meng\u2019s timely arrival and announcement of the Head\u2019s command, then he would have had to sacrifice Kai Yang. Su Mu was angry at the way things were handled and specially wanted to give Kai Yang that many pills.\u201cWhat about senior sister Su Yan?\u201d Kai Yang turned his head around as he queried.Su Mu\u2019s expression became strange, he had already heard from Li Yun Tian and the others about Kai Yang\u2019s feats. He felt both afraid and respectful, because from when he was young till now, Su Yan had never felt like an older sister, but more like his own mother. In front of Su Yan, he never dared to take even a single deep breath.But looking at this senior brother Kai, his courage was beyond large! He actually dared to hold his older sister\u2019s hand in front of so many people and say such daring words.And afterwards, this sister of his did nothing! Not only did she do nothing, she actually arranged for him to rest in her house. This course of action was simply unbelievable!These past two days during which Kai Yang had been unconscious, Su Mu had racked his brains. But he still couldn\u2019t come up with any viable theories.Why? Why would she do this?\u201cAi! Senior brother Kai!\u201d Su Mu took in a deep breath and clapped Kai Yang on the back. After a while, carefully considering his wording he finally said: \u201cGrief! Since ancient times, beautiful flowers would often leak water and do ruthless things. Senior brother Kai, you must open your eyes and be careful.\u201dKai Yang was startled and it wasn\u2019t until a short while later that he managed to let out a dry laugh. He knew that Su Mu had misunderstood him, but he didn\u2019t know how to explain it and could only ask: \u201cWhere is she?\u201dThis time, it was all thanks to her arriving at the crucial time and rescuing him that he was okay, otherwise he would have needed to use his Yang Liquid to kill those Disciplinary Hall Disciples in the wooden hut. But facing those disciples, he wasn\u2019t confident that he would truly be able to execute the killing blows required. But no matter what, if he walked down that path, then there was no room for leeway.\u201cAfter she settled you down here, she left Black Wind Trade.\u201d Su Mu answered.\u201cWhen senior sister left, did she say anything?\u201d Kai Yang was a bit suspicious. Originally, he thought that Su Yan would want to speak with him, because the actions that he took were a bit over the top.\u201cNothing.\u201d Su Mu slowly shook his head in reply.Kai Yang secretly admired her inside.This senior sister really wasn\u2019t affected. When it concerned her reputation and integrity, she actually didn\u2019t even bother to explain anything, about the complications, about the truth!After saying this words, Su Mu left.Lying on the bed, Kai Yang didn\u2019t ponder it further, because things had already reached this point, thinking about it anymore wouldn\u2019t make a difference. Just as well Su Mu brought those immortal pills, now he could really go and test whether or not his theory was correct.Within these pills, half of them were for healing while the other half were for cultivation. Adding them together, their value wasn\u2019t small at all.Kai Yang first took some healing pills, then he started to work his True Yang Tactics. This helped to dissolve the pills and and allowed him to feel changes occurring within his body.It didn\u2019t need to be said, but these healing pills\u2019 effects were quite good. He felt the pills working within his meridians and a short while later, he could feel a comfortable feeling flow to the position of his injuries, meanwhile the aching feeling became dull.But Kai Yang could feel that apart from healing his wounds and entering his meridians, a portion of the energy had also entered his bones.Feeling this, Kai Yang\u2019s eyebrows lifted as he confirmed his suspicions.Once confirming his guess, Kai Yang spent the entire day eating all kinds of pills.The end result was clear, his golden skeleton, truly could absorb other types of energy, and wouldn\u2019t just absorb Yang type energy!Long before he had broken into the initial element stage, he had already made this hypothesis, it was just that he didn\u2019t have any way to prove it.The True Yang Tactics was no doubt a special and powerful skill, allowing him to absorb Yang energy endlessly and when used in battle, it\u2019s killing power was great. But this skill had a great flaw, that was it\u2019s cultivating conditions were far too strict.You must be in a Yang type environment to cultivate.Originally he was worried that he would be affected by the environment, but now with his golden skeleton\u2019s domineering power he no longer needed to worry about this.When there was Yang energy, he would cultivate with the True Yang Tactics, when there wasn\u2019t any it didn\u2019t matter because his golden skeleton wasn\u2019t picky and would accept all types of energy.With both options available, he would no longer need to worry about his cultivation being hindered when Yang energy wasn\u2019t present.This energy was being absorbed by the golden skeleton, and later when he battles, the skeleton would just give the energy back to him allowing him to power up.Kai Yang faintly felt that there was some undescribable relationship between his golden skeleton and the True Yang Tactics. But as for what that relationship was, he wasn\u2019t too clear.By the time Kai Yang recovered and became conscious again, he was given quite a scare.Without his notice, he had actually used up five bottles of the pills, each bottle contained ten pills; in other words, he had consumed fifty pills. They weren\u2019t that high quality, but if a normal person were to consume that many pills, their body would be unable to support it.However, he was still perfectly fine and his injuries had healed by quite a fair amount.Within the darkness, a sluggish light could be seen within his eyes. Looking at the remaining seven to eight different kinds of pills left, he thought of a crazy idea.Once this idea formed, he was unable to suppress it.After thinking it over, Kai Yang finally decided to take the gamble!Picking up a bottle, he opened it up; no matter if it was healing pills or cultivation ones, he poured the entire contents of the bottle into his mouth. Then he took another bottle and poured it into his mouth\u2026\u2026..Once all of the bottles had been emptied, Kai Yang nonchalantly licked the inside of his mouth.If a normal person were to see this scene, they would pee their pants! Although these pills weren\u2019t poisonous, you still couldn\u2019t eat them like you were eating beans. One must know that all medicine contains poison, and no matter what kind of pill, there was always a bottom line. If you surpass this limit, then it would prove detrimental to your health, cultivation and even your foundation.But in that short time, Kai Yang actually swallowed seven or eight different kinds of immortal pills.Smacking his lips, Kai Yang felt that his stomach was bulging and bursting with the various types of weak medicinal energy clashing. After a short while, the various energies converged together into a terrifying energy.Kai Yang had been prepared for this and immediately started to activate the True Yang Tactics.The energy was akin to a flood dragon that had broken free from a trap, turning around in his stomach. This caused Kai Yang to groan softly, as he felt that his abdominal area was being ripped apart.The revolving speed of the True Yang Tactics hadn\u2019t accelerated by that much, it was more like an an attraction force was present. The converged energy from the seven-eight different pills contained a type of attraction force allowing them to be slowly assimilated into his meridians.Kai Yang didn\u2019t dare to relax in the slightest and diligently monitored his condition.This flood dragon like energy raged about in his meridians and was incompatible with his World Qi. Although the two energies mixed with each other, no matter what, they wouldn\u2019t fuse together.Not only this, the flowing paths of the two energies within his meridians were completely different.While the True Yang World Qi flowed in a clockwise direction, the immense immortal pill energy flowed anticlockwise.Kai Yang\u2019s body suddenly became bright, suddenly became dark, and in an instant it became bright red. After his skin changed colour, in every meridian, it felt like thousands of insects were crawling around. And a drumming noise rang out non-stop, if anyone were to see this, they would be horrified.As time passed, the impurities within that vast amount of energy slowly disappeared and drop by drop, little by little the energy was absorbed into his bones. The golden skeleton turned into some kind of ravenous beast, hungrily swallowing the overflowing energy by the mouthful.Under this extreme pain, Kai Yang\u2019s senses were at their peak. It was like he had grown a pair of eyes within his body. This allowed him to see the mixing of the True Yang World Qi and see how each and every strand of the tumultuous pill energy melded.Faintly, he realised something!Kai Yang thought about the battles he had previously, how blood flew everywhere, how painful he felt and about his bloodthirsty **. Each and every time, after his pain, along with his unshakable willpower, his own power would rapidly increase to a level that allow him to defeat his opponent.This was especially so in that battle two days ago in the wooden hut outside the Forest Prison against the five Disciplinary Hall Disciples, their cultivation had clearly been much higher than his. That battle was clearly imprinted in his mind.With his blood boiling once again, a warm and familiar feeling came out from his bones, the energy that was absorbed by the golden skeleton was given back to him and momentarily allowed him to increase his strength.This wasn\u2019t enough! Kai Yang felt that he was still missing something and without that part, he would never be able to fully understand the mysteries of the golden skeleton.He still needed one more true battle!Realising this point, Kai Yang jumped off the bed. Breathing rapidly with coarse breaths, he pushed open the door and looked around, and walked directly to the house opposite him and kicked it open.Kai Yang guessed that Su Mu was residing in that room, because not long ago he heard movement. He wanted to find someone to have a good fight with, and Su Mu was that person.As he opened the door, Kai Yang\u2019s eyes fell upon a clean and clear back. Just as he was about to issue his challenge, he was forced to swallow his words.Under the moonlight, beside the windowsill, was an extremely beautiful and heartstring pulling scene.Creamy white skin, icy firm muscles, flowing around the various curves on her back.This scene really shook one to the core, Kai Yang\u2019s three carnal desires nearly flew out.This room really had someone in it, it just wasn\u2019t Su Mu as Kai Yang had imagined, but Su Yan!p.s. Sorry for the late release, because this chapter was especially long and extended. I was twice the normal length, so going late into the late I feel asleep. I quickly finished it this morning, and surprise, surprise. Kai Yang walked in on Su Yan changing\u2026\u2026..hope he doesn't die. O.OPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thus her her jade white curvaceous backside, along with her perfectly rounded bottom, long and slender legs and her snow white skin, were all seen by Kai Yang.Even though it was at night, Kai Yang still saw everything quite clearly.That back was so perfectly curved, while her glossy shoulders emitted a scent of seduction. That exquisitely balanced waistline rested on a pair of perfectly round buttocks, not too big and not too small, the overall picture caused ones blood vessels to expand and ones heart rate to skyrocket. The underwear that clung to her bottom a bit obscenely, only served to make his heart pound even more fiercely.Because her skin was so fair and white, and because her undergarments were both white in colour, it seemed as if her entire body was on display.Maybe it was because she heard the movements behind her, she immediately used her hand to cover her chest and turned her body halfway towards the door. In her other hand was a white nightgown; it seemed that she was just in the middle of changing.(TL: Nah genius, and does Su Yan love white or something?)The two people\u2019s gazes met in midair, Kai Yang looked startled but couldn\u2019t help that his gaze travelled downwards to her white and full chest. Su Yan on the other hand, was quivering with anger and a flash of killing intent could be seen in her eyesThat was because she saw a pair of blood red eyes! These blood red eyes were like those of a hungry wolf, with hints of gluttony, unbridled as it swept its gaze across her irreproachably. Not only this, the male was breathing coarsely, like his ** was rising.\u201cKa cha cha\u2026\u2026..\u201d With Su Yan as the centre, a sheet of ice quickly spread across the room in all four directions. Her dark red lips pursed, coldness within her eyes.Kai Yang finally realised something wasn\u2019t right so he quickly turned his body around and sprinted away from the room with his top speed.His speed was very fast and in three breaths time, he had already run out of the room. But before he could choose a clear direction to head in, from behind him he heard a loud cracking sound. A large hole had appeared in the middle of the house, a white figure flew out from within the hole. Reaching Kai Yang, he could could see traces of fury on that cold face.Kai Yang immediately retreated a few steps and took up a defensive stance as he thought of a way to explain everything. But thinking it over, no matter what he said, it would make no difference.Any girl who had her back seen like that, wouldn\u2019t let the culprit off easily!Su Yan had already dressed herself, while she stood there looking at Kai Yang frostily. Although she knew that Kai Yang probably didn\u2019t do it on purpose, because he wouldn\u2019t have known he would wake in Black Wind Trade, not to mention that he would be in the house opposite to her,she couldn\u2019t forgive him.You could only say it was a big misunderstanding! But even though it was just a misunderstanding, Su Yan couldn\u2019t just let the matter slide like this!She was waiting for an explanation, an explanation that would calm her fury.Unfortunately, that male who was standing directly opposite to her, didn\u2019t say a single word. His eyes were still that blood red colour and he let out a heavy aura of bloodthirstiness, without the slightest bit of cowardice or shame.Good, then I don\u2019t want your explanation, rather I only want to beat you up to relieve this lump in my throat!An ice crystal slowly formed on Su Yan\u2019s fingertips. Then she flung her fingertips forward and that ice crystal flew out towards Kai Yang.As it flew out, I rapidly grew in size whilst also rotating at high speeds. By the time it reached Kai Yang, it was the size of the a wash basin.Kai Yang didn\u2019t dare to be negligent in the slightest. Activating his True Yang World Qi, his fist collided with the ice crystal.His fist aching, the Yin attributed ice crystal and Yang attributed True Yang World Qi collided, cancelling each other out. When the punch connected with the wash basin sized ice crystal, it quickly shattered into pieces.Sou, sou, sou\u2026\u2026.the shattered ice crystal became sharp ice shards that bombard Kai Yang.Kai Yang couldn\u2019t react in time, so more than ten wounds appeared on his body, causing blood to flow freely. His already battered body, became even more battered and seemed on the verge of collapse.Kai Yang yelled in a low voice and the golden skeleton once again showed its might. As the warm feeling spread, he felt his body\u2019s strength slowly increase bit by bit.Shock could be seen in Su Yan\u2019s eyes. She thought that her move would be more than enough to knock Kai Yang unconscious, she never would have thought that her move would be countered.Her body swaying, like an immortal fairy that descended amongst mortals, she flew towards Kai Yang. In an instant, she was at Kai Yang\u2019s shoulder.An ice-cold feeling immediately spread from his shoulder and he hurriedly retreated a few more steps. Turning to see it, Kai Yang narrowed his eyes as he saw a layer of ice on his shoulder, that was quickly forming ice crystals.Without any hesitation, Kai Yang tore off the clothing around his shoulder and called out a drop of Yang Liquid to smear on his shoulder.Hiss hiss\u2026\u2026the ice hissed, Kia Yang\u2019s shoulder burned like a burning piece of iron, momentarily becoming bright red. The coldness that had been spreading, was burned away by that Yang Liquid drop, disappearing in the blink of an eye.Su Yan became even more stunned, she had never imagined that Kai Yang would be about to use such freakish methods to to melt her ice qi. Frost appearing in her eyes, Su Yan called upon the Thousand Layered Snow Waves which swarmed around her, hiding her body within the layers of snow, as they rotated towards Kai Yang.The Thousand Layered Snow Waves were not only majestic like a snowstorm but also extremely powerful, in an instant Kai Yang was swallowed up by the waves of snow.The bone piercing cold, froze his heart. Even though he cultivated the True Yang Tactics, Kai Yang felt that he would soon freeze and become an ice sculpture.He knew that this senior sister Su Yan was extremely angry, although there was no killing intent in her attacks, it was clear that she wanted to severely teach him a lesson.However this situation gave Kai Yang an idea. Although his opponent was much higher levelled than him, and he couldn\u2019t resist in the slightest, he could still use it to test his findings.This opponent was a thousand times better than Su Mu.Within the snowstorm, Su Yan continuously attacked and Kai Yang was completely unable to defend himself, groaning with each blow. A trail of blood leaked out from the corner of his mouth, while his body was shivering from the cold, bitterly fighting the invasion of the cold air.In the midst of this predicament, Kai Yang\u2019s thoughts became clearer and clearer and he actually gave up all forms of resistance and began to openly receive the entirety of Su Yan\u2019s attacks.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d The ruckus had woken several others, with the Second Elder Su Xuan Wu being the first to arrive at the scene, followed by Su Mu leading Li Yun Tian and the rest over.Seeing the scene before them, the arriving people couldn\u2019t help but unconsciously take a deep breath.Snow was flying wildly all over the place, Kai Yang\u2019s ** upper body was visible as he stood still with his eyes closed, he was currently enduring all of Su Yan\u2019s attacks. His body looked like a very shredded rag sack, repeatedly being hit by Su Yan. As he was being hit, his body flew all over the place from the impacts, but never seemed to touch the ground.\u201cHiss\u2026\u2026.\u201d Su Mu exhaled a breath of air, \u201cHow did senior brother Kai provoke elder sister?\u201d\u201cIt could be that senior sister is extracting revenge for the things that happened a few days ago.\u201d Li Yun Tian suggested with great fear.\u201cIt must be so, otherwise with senior sister\u2019s temper, why would she beat senior brother Kai for no reason?\u201d\u201cOur pitiful senior brother Kai. His injuries have yet to fully heal, yet he has already invited such a great calamity. Senior sister\u2019s attack are too ruthless.\u201dAll of the whisperings from the group of people were heard by Su Yan, they only served to anger her more. Today it was Kai Yang who had seen her body, causing her to act out. But from their mouths, it seemed like she was the villain with a small mind, extracting her revenge.Su Yan\u2019s hands became even more ruthless.p.s. Sorry guys, my maths teacher is ruthless. I had another test today on parametrics\u2026\u2026.so I spent the week studying, since we only learnt the topic this term. Plus I only slept 4 hours last night, zzzZZ. Hope you enjoyed the chapter and good night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wrapped within that cold hurricane of air, shivering due to the cold piercing him to the core of his body, he could see a flaming hot energy within his core spreading its warmth. When this fiery energy burst outwards, perhaps he would be able to step into a new level.If he were to succeed, then his future accomplishments definitely would not be ordinary! Su Xuan Wu had truly never seen a martial practitioner who while in such a sorry state, would actually be able to enter such a deep state of enlightenment. This was nothing short of a miracle.\u201cGrandpa, I\u2019m afraid that if elder sister continues like this, then senior brother Kai Yang will die.\u201d Su Mu cried out urgently.Su Xuan Wu replied with a shake of his head: \u201cYan-er knows how to control the strength of her attacks properly, and within her attacks, there are no killing attacks; after all, she doesn\u2019t want Kai Yang\u2019s life.\u201dFinishing this statement, he then whispered to himself: \u201cStrange\u2026\u2026.why would Yan-er punish him like this?\u201dIf not because Su Xuan Wu was mature and sophisticated, then he definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to guess as to what had just happened between Su Yan and Kai Yang.When the ice storm died down, Su Yan continued to float in the air, while Kai Yang fell towards the ground. His entire body was battered all over, his clothes torn and where you could see his skin there were signs of frostbite.Just as he was about to hit the ground, Kai Yang suddenly did a flip and landed firmly on the ground and opened his eyes to look around.Under the starlight, Su Yan\u2019s white clothes fluttered about with the night breeze, she was like a fairy descending with the full moon hanging behind her.Her grand and clean aura made people become more modest for no apparent reason.Ka cha cha\u2026..could be heard from all directions as ice started to form all over Kai Yang\u2019s body. Soon, he had become an immense ice block.The smoothness of the ice block was obvious, it was also as clear as glass. It was so clear that every single strand of Kai Yang\u2019s hair could be seen, even his attitude and feelings could be clearly seen on his face.Su Yan didn\u2019t say a word, only turning to look at Kai Yang mysteriously before turning around and returning to her room.The scene of her leaving was clearly seen by Kai Yang.\u201cLook after him, once he breaks free from the ice it will be the start of his success!\u201d Su Xuan Wu solemnly told Su Mu.Su Mu was nervous to the point that he started perspire: \u201cGrandpa, senior Kai won\u2019t be frozen to death, will he?\u201dSu Xuan Wu gently laughed: \u201cHe won\u2019t, this is his good fortune!\u201dAfter reassuring Su Mu he turned and left.Only then did Su Mu\u2019s group walk up quietly and softly to the ice block containing Kai Yang. Each and everyone of them surrounded that enormous ice block, tapping away at it. But with Su Yan\u2019s comprehension of the ice arts, would they be able to break it?\u201cThis is bad, this is bad! Senior brother is already injured, and now that he is frozen, I\u2019m afraid that his little brother may also become frozen and fall off. How is this good?\u201d ** didn\u2019t have any sort of filter, so as soon as he thought of it he said it, he was glared at by Su Mu: \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear my grandfather say, this is senior Kai\u2019s good fortune, huh? Everybody don\u2019t move, if this ice breaks and hurts senior, it won\u2019t be good. We\u2019ll just stand guard here.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The group of people chorused.Guarding until the fifth bell toll of the night (3-5 am in current time), there had still been no movement from the ice block and Kai Yang continued to stay in it like the living dead. His breath shallow, he could only continue to look at the place where Su Yan disappeared to.Su Mu\u2019s group considered the situation for a while before deciding to leave two people behind to guard Kai Yang while the rest returned to do whatever they needed to do.This continued for an entire three days. Within a small attic was a large ice block, and inside that was a living person. Looking at it, it was as strange as strange could get.During these past three days, they had rotated their shifts countless times and yet the ice still showed no signs of breaking. This caused the group to become so anxious that their lips were blistered.During these three days, Kai Yang didn\u2019t feel the flow of time; although his eyes were open, he couldn\u2019t see anything.All of his focus was on comprehending the changes occurring within his body.Sensing the energy within his bones, sensing that unyielding warmth the energy brought along with it, and sensing how that warmth would boost his strength each and every time.The ice that Su Yan left behind for him, provided him with the perfect place to comprehend what was happening accurately. The energy contained within the ice block left behind, constantly released cold air that permeated him to his core.This cold was something that the current Kai Yang could not resist, but he managed to resists every time. Each time, he relied on the mystical properties of the golden skeleton.Resisting hundreds of times, thousands of times, allowed Kia Yang to understand the mysteries of the golden skeleton and why it could amplify his abilities.Within his body, a small flame had started to burn hotter and hotter, and it would do so until the day he finally comprehended what was occurring. This flame continued to burn peacefully, until it finally started to send heat waves out of Kai Yang\u2019s body.A breaking sound rang out!Su Mu and Li Yun Tian who were currently on the guarding shift were startled but they quickly turned their heads around.They only saw small numerous cracks appearing all over the ice block, with the cracks resembling the strands of a spiderweb.\u201cSenior Kai is about to come out!\u201d Su Mu cried with enthusiasm and certainty.Sure enough, as soon as he said those words, the ice block exploded and the shards melted in the light before disappearing.Kai Yang remained standing in his previous position, his bloodstained upper body ** did look a bit weak, but his eyebrows were creased showing he was still deep in thought.Su Mu and Li Yun Tian didn\u2019t dare to disturb him, so they quietly waited off to the side.After a good half an hour, Kai Yang\u2019s worried looked disappeared and he stated in a cheerful tone: \u201cSince it\u2019s so, I will call you Immovable Will.\u201dImmovable Will was the thing that Kai Yang had gained an understanding of during these three days. This martial skill was not one you could use to attack, but rather one that helped to strengthen one's body.This was the skill that he had learned from the golden skeleton, so this skill was closely related to the skeleton.Only when one has an unyielding spirit, is unwilling to surrender under any adversary, will they be able unlock this type of skill. As soon as he activates it, the golden skeleton will give him energy to temporarily increase his strength and fighting ability.Although previously he was unknowingly activating this Immovable Will skill he didn\u2019t have any understanding of it, with this type of martial skill there is a big difference in the power it displayed once it was understood.In other words, he could now say that he had completely grasped this secret skill with his own hands. It could be also said it was a skill exclusive to him.It was no longer the same as before, when he is battle and/or receives injuries, he no longer needs to rely on his stubbornness to activate the skill.Although his harvest this time was great, Kai Yang was still a bit unsatisfied, because he could sense that there were still secrets hidden within the golden skeleton. Yet since he couldn\u2019t see through them he couldn\u2019t claim them, thus he couldn\u2019t help but feel regret.The days are long, and one shouldn\u2019t care over one lost hour, Kai Yang consoled himself.Only when Kia Yang started to move, did Su Mu and Li Yun Tian walk up to him, asking worriedly: \u201cSenior Kai, are you alright?\u201d\u201cMe? I\u2019m very good!\u201d Kai Yang moved his limbs around and found that all this past injuries had all healed.\u201cI shall help you put your clothes on, otherwise if elder sister were to see you again, I\u2019m afraid she might beat you again.\u201d Su Mu said, his voice full of worry.p.s. First chappy of the weekkkkkk. Well, Kai Yang gaiend some insight and I'm starting to like Su Mu more and more. Cause he actually seems human and more normal than most xianxia characters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Speaking of this, ever since he had left the Forest Prison, he had either been unconscious, or unable to enquire due to other reasons, such as being frozen in an ice block, so he really didn\u2019t know how the Main Gate had dealt with the problem.\u201cThat affair has already been brought to a close. The Elders have ordered us juniors to not pursue this matter any further.\u201d Su Mu answered before suddenly looking at Kia Yang with great suspicion: \u201cTruth be told, the reason why we are safe and will suffer no further punishment, is not because of my Grandfather.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d Kai Yang lifted up his head, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because of the Second Elder?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d Su Mu slowly shook his head, then a bit awkwardly he retold the events that had occurred in the Elder Hall that day. Then he followed up with: \u201cJust as I was being restrained by my grandfather, guess who appeared?\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cThis person is someone you would never have thought of. It was the Contribution Hall\u2019s Treasurer Meng.He brought the Head\u2019s jade pendant, and issued his direct command. Only after this did this affair die down and turn into something small that could be resolved.\u201d\u201cOld man Meng?\u201d Kai Yang asked incredulously.\u201cIf not for him, then senior Kai, I\u2019m afraid that you would have already been severely punished by the Grand Elder.\u201d When Su Mu spoke of this, his face became filled with extreme guilt.Meanwhile Kai Yang smiled, unaffected: \u201cJunior Su, you don\u2019t need to take this so seriously.\u201dSu Mu clasped both his hands in front of him saying: \u201cI know that senior is a generous and benevolent person, and I apologise to you in place of my grandfather. The old ghost truly didn\u2019t settle things well this time.\u201dKai Yang really didn\u2019t mind such a thing, because in the higher levelled battles, they would naturally use the disciples under them as chess pieces. This was only human nature.Su Mu spoke again: \u201cTreasurer Meng\u2019s background is quite a mystery, the old ghost said that his cultivation is quite high and profound. It is quite a puzzle as to why he interfered in this matter, also it appears his friendship with the Head runs deep.\u201dThis caused Kai Yang to contemplate a bit: \u201cOld man Meng is someone who grabs feathers from a flying goose, and wouldn\u2019t act if there wasn\u2019t any profit in sight. This type of brain wracking idea is most likely for a for a reason regarding the bigger picture. But no matter what it is, he did help us, so we should pay a trip to him to thank him at least and take this opportunity to see what he actually wants to do.\u201d\u201cSenior speaks the truth, we were waiting for senior so we could go together.\u201d Su Mu replied.\u201cLet\u2019s go now.\u201dSome things should not be delayed, so this group walked majestically off towards the Contribution Hall, like they were charging off to battle.In the Contribution Hall, Treasurer Meng was actually not sleeping, but sitting straight behind the counter smiling. As he smiled, he looked at Kai Yang and others who had just walked in; it was like he was expecting them.Su Mu followed Kai Yang in with a smile, hiding his true thoughts: \u201cGood day to grandpa Meng!\u201dThis is how they addressed Treasurer Meng now, it used to be \u201cDamn old man\u201d. But now, how would Su Mu dare to call him that?Treasurer Meng lightly chuckled: \u201cThis child is quite polite.\u201d\u201cHei hei.\u201d Su Mu said with a bit of embarrassment.\u201cYou have come to say your thanks?\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d They all nodded their heads.\u201cThen that\u2019s fine, only little Kai Yang needs to stay, the rest of you can all scram!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Su Mu and the rest replied without hesitation and before the places they stood in could heat up, they had all quickly retreated from the Contribution Hall. By then, they had all realised the reason why Treasurer Meng had aided them was because of Kai Yang. Otherwise, why would he have only asked Kai Yang to stay behind?It was just\u2026\u2026why did he help senior Kai?Inside the Contribution Hall, Kai Yang was also a bit suspicious: \u201cTreasurer Meng, what are you scheming?\u201dHe didn\u2019t talk in circles and directly voiced the suspicions in his heart.Meng Wu Ya only he he laughed, and then walked out from behind the counter. Clasping both hands he started to walk in circles around Kai Yang, and only after a few revolutions did he lift up his head and ask: \u201cWhat do you think I am scheming?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Kai Yang rolled his eyes while thinking if he knew the answer, would he ask need to ask.Meng Wu Ya replied: \u201cSince you are this honest and do not talk in circles. You should be someone who knows how to pay his debts. So, since I helped you this time, I want to you help me with one little favour.\u201dKai Yang knitted his eyebrows together: \u201cA favour I can help you with?\u201dTreasurer Meng\u2019s cultivation was high and profound, so if he couldn\u2019t do it, how could Kai Yang possibly do it?Like he could see through Kai Yang\u2019s worries, Treasurer Meng smiled: \u201cDon\u2019t worry because there isn\u2019t much danger at all. If you do as I say, not only will there be no danger, you will actually gain many rewards.\u201dKai Yang was able to see that when Treasurer Meng said those last words, his face showed a bit of sadness.\u201cHelping you complete this favour, there are also conditions?\u201d Kai Yang was a bit puzzled. When he was asking for a favour, he still put so many conditions up.Treasurer Meng said: \u201cNot only do you have to comply with my conditions, you also have to make the opposite party completely satisfied.\u201d\u201cSo troublesome, I won\u2019t do it.\u201d Spinning on his heels, Kai Yang started to leave.\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Treasurer Meng cried out in worry. He had finally found someone who fit his requirements, how could he let him leave like that?\u201cLittle Kai Yang, you can\u2019t be like this ah. If you let water drip, then it will repay you by giving you a spring pond. No matter what, this senior is your benefactor, so how could you just disappoint me like this?\u201d\u201cThen don\u2019t walk around in circles. Speak out the truth and if I can help you I will help you. If I cannot, I will find someone else to help you.\u201d\u201cStretch out your hand, I want to test out your World Qi.\u201d Treasurer Meng didn\u2019t dare to drag it out any further and directly stated what he needed.Kai Yang looked at him suspiciously as he stretched out his hand. He was convinced that Treasurer Meng was going to do something harmful to himMeng Wu Ya used two fingers and placed them on Kai Yang\u2019s wrist, then with a solemn face he started probe about. His face was a flurry of expressions, the first one was indifference, the next one was stern, while the one after that was amazement, and finally he looked flabbergasted.\u201cGood, good, good! Such strong and pure Yang World Qi!\u201d Retracting his hand, Meng Wu Ya was overjoyed at this unexpected discovery.\u201cThis favour is related to me training my World Qi?\u201d Kai Yang guessed.\u201cNaturally they are related.\u201d Meng Wu Ya vigorously nodded his head, \u201cOtherwise, why would I come and ask you. Little Kai Yang, I will ask you another question and you must answer honestly.\u201d\u201cWhat question?\u201dMeng Wu Ya suddenly became really embarrassed as his eyes flitted to and fro. After thinking for quite some time about his word choice, he asked in a nervous but anticipating tone: \u201cYou are still a boy right?\u201dBecause he was too nervous, Meng Wu Ya\u2019s neck was stretched out quite far as he pushed his face in front of Kai Yang\u2019s; both his eyes fixed on him.Kai Yang immediately retreated two steps, then three more. Following that, goosebumps rose all over his body and his body shivered as he asked with extreme vigilance: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dThis old thing, could it be that he had some special disposition? This question was far too nonsensical!\u201cWhy have you retreated so far? It isn\u2019t like this senior is going to eat you!\u201d Meng Wu Ya chased Kai Yang, once he backed him into a corner he asked in a mysteriously low voice: \u201cAre really still a boy or not?\u201d\u201cWhat do you really want to do?\u201d Kai Yang adopted a \u201cif you dare do anything I will take you down with me\u201d type of pose.\u201cWhat do you think this senior is?\u201d When Meng Wu Ya saw Kai Yang\u2019s position, he finally realised what Kai Yang was thinking or thought he had meant when he had asked him. Not only did his face turn red, he also retreated a few steps, \u201cIt isn\u2019t like this at all. This kid, you are so dirty minded!\u201dp.s. Bwahahaha, that last part was to hilarious. I mean Kai Yang's misunderstanding and then Meng's realisation. Too funny. Also this chapter I guess you could count as an extra chapter for this week. A nice treat for you all^ \ud83d\ude00Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Cupping his hands and begging: \u201cLord Kai Yang, Lord Kai Yang, could you not speak about this matter anymore? This senior only wanted to see how well they developed. It\u2019s not like I wanted to do anything to them.\u201dSeeing that he had surrendered, Kai Yang didn\u2019t press him further and sternly replied: \u201cThe favour that you want me to help you with, is it related to these cases in anyway?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d When they started to speak about the true matter at hand, Meng Wu Ya\u2019s face turned solemn again: \u201cSo little Kai Yang, you must truthfully answer me; are you still a boy\u2026\u2026.cough cough\u2026\u2026\u2026en? It is of great importance to the matter.\u201dKai Yang became very embarrassed as he took in a few breaths through his nose: \u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d\u201cGood!\u201d The weight within Meng Wu Ya\u2019s heart had finally been lifted, \u201cThis is too good! Little Kai Yang, you are good.\u201dIn this age, many boys at fourteen-fifteen years old, had already had intimate dealings with females. This is not to say anything bad about the children of poor families, since they married at a young age to help them in the long run. As for the children of rich families, you don\u2019t even need to ask. Every one of those second generation young masters, had several maids that they shared a room with.That left only martial practitioners. Since their hearts were always focused on cultivating, they often lost their virginity quite late, whilst some practitioners did not even have any intimate relationships with the opposite sex.(TLN: Where the hell is this going??? \ud83d\ude12)Even the male disciples in Sky Tower, many of the fifteen-sixteen year olds often busied themselves with carnal pleasures. Nonetheless, Meng Wu Ya believed that Kai Yang wasn\u2019t like those people, but he had to be careful, so he had to ask.\u201cIn other words, I am able to help you?\u201d Kai Yang looked at Meng Wu Ya (like this: \ud83d\ude12)\u201cIf you can\u2019t, then no one else under the sky can. You have passed this round!\u201d Since Meng Wu Ya\u2019s mood was fantastics, he laughed out loudly.\u201cDidn\u2019t you just say that you wanted the other person to be completely satisfied?\u201d Kai Yang asked suspiciously.Meng Wu Ya\u2019s laughter suddenly halted. Retracting it, he stiffly nodded his head and replied: \u201cYou do have to make her satisfied, if she isn\u2019t satisfied, then the job cannot be completed. Not to hide anything from you, but a few months earlier I had found someone who fit the criteria, but she wasn\u2019t willingly, so I could only drop the matter. Forget about it, I will take you to her, if you can do it, do it, but if you can\u2019t\u2026\u2026..then you can\u2019t\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter talking for all this time, Meng Wu Ya still didn\u2019t know how to continue explaining. Only after letting out a small sigh, he grabbed Kai Yang by the collar and led him outside.Hastily, Kai Yang said: \u201cFirst finish what you need to say. I am helping you because I want to thank you for your benevolence, but if what that person is asking is too excessive, I will not agree.\u201d\u201cStinking brat!\u201d Meng Wu Ya was highly depressed. When he heard Kai Yang making all types of excuses, he burst into a fit of anger while thinking if you knew what I really wanted you to do, then you wouldn\u2019t be able to wait and would instantly jump and attempt to complete it. He actually dared to act cold front in front of him.As he followed Meng Wu Ya, Kai Yang realised that they were walking towards Coiling Dragon Stream.Furthermore, he discovered that it was near the place that he often cultivated.Why are they walking over there? When he was training over there, he hadn\u2019t seen any traces of housing near there at all. Afterall, Coiling Dragon Stream is a dangerous place, so ordinarily no one would go there.When they were about hundred feet away from his training place, Meng Wu Ya, suddenly stopped, and pointed his finger in front of him: \u201cLook, it\u2019s over there.\u201dLooking over, Kai Yang couldn\u2019t help but stare blankly over.Standing where he usually trained, was a female. She stood in front of the Three Sun Fruit tree, wearing a light green dress. You couldn\u2019t see what she was thinking about, it seemed that she was deep in thought. Her body didn\u2019t move at all, she stood there unmoving, while her dress billowed in the wind.She wore a veil, not allowing anyone to see her appearence.On her forehead hung a sparkling blue gemstone, highlighting her elegant and refined nature.Her figure looked weak and fragile, like it couldn\u2019t even endure a gust of wind, but it was a graceful figure.Within her pair of crystal clear eyes was naivety, like she was a child that had yet to grow up.Looking at her, Kai Yang thought about that night, the sleeping beauty on his worn out bed.\u201cIt\u2019s her!\u201d Kai Yang\u2019s gaze suddenly softened.\u201cYou recognise her?\u201d Meng Wu Ya immediately became alert, because his beloved disciple had told him from her own mouth that she hadn\u2019t even talked to Kai Yang before. But why, when Kai Yang arrived, had they actually recognised each other?\u201cYou wanted me to help her?\u201d Kai Yang asked, looking at Meng Wu Ya.\u201cYes!\u201d Meng Wu Ya nodded his head.\u201cI\u2019ll help!\u201d Outside of Treasurer Meng\u2019s expectations, Kai Yang agreed to his request without the slightest hesitation. It seemed as though his persuasive words and appeals to him through reason, emotion, violence and bribery were not completely useless afterall.Within Meng Wu Ya\u2019s heart, for no reason a wonderful feeling burst out and he suddenly regretted asking Kai Yang for help.\u201cWhy did you agree so readily?\u201d Old man Meng vigilantly asked. \u201cDidn\u2019t you ask for my assistance?\u201d His brows creased, Kai Yang looked at Meng Wu Ya. This old man changed attitudes far too quickly.\u201cI did want you to help me, but you agreed far too quickly for my liking.\u201d Meng Wu Ya kept on shaking his head, \u201cYou must give me an explanation.\u201d\u201cThen do you want my help or not?\u201d Kai Yang impatiently asked.\u201cOf course, of course I do.\u201d\u201cThen what are you asking for. Me agreeing, isn\u2019t it a good thing?\u201dThat\u2019s right, him agreeing that readily, isn\u2019t it a good thing? Why did he feel that something wasn\u2019t right? Meng Wu Ya looked distracted.Step by step, Kai Yang walked forward.The sound of his footsteps startled Xia Ning Chang who was currently deep in thought, and by the time she regained conscious, Kai Yang had already arrived at her side.Xia Ning Chang was clearly at a loss, and looked at Kai Yang not knowing what to do.She couldn\u2019t help but be frightened because the previous two times they met were both at night and embarrassing things had occurred. How could Xia Ning Chang stay calm?\u201cSenior Xia.\u201d Kai Yang looked at her, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u2026.I came here to check up on the fruits for you. Since you haven\u2019t come these past few days, I was afraid that others might have taken them.\u201d She promptly replied.Looking over, Kai Yang saw that all of his Three Sun Fruits had disappeared. The only ones remaining were the ones on the last tree that were about to ripen.\u201cThese are your fruits, I have refined them into immortality pills.\u201d As Xia Ning Chang spoke, she took out a small bottle and handed it to Kai Yang.Taking it, Kia Yang discovered nine pills were rolling about inside and they dispersed a rich Yang energy.It was extremely pure, they didn\u2019t have any impurities in them at all. It was just\u2026\u2026how did she refine them into pills?\u201cSenior knows that I train over here?\u201d Kia Yang asked and raised his eyebrows. If this was not the case, how could she have come here to guard his Three Sun\u2019s Fruit.Xia Ning Chang evaded his gaze: \u201cI accidentally stumbled upon it.\u201d\u201cThe person that night really was you.\u201d Kai Yang lightly smiled, a warm feeling spreading from his heart throughout his body.p.s. This was supposed to be my yesterday's chapter (Wednesday), but due to it not being edited in time and me not having access to a computer, it got delayed because of my school swimming carvnial.

    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Martial PeakChapter 83 \u2013 What is special about Xia Ning ChangPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 83 \u2013 What is special about Xia Ning ChangThe night that Kai Yang broke through into the initial element stage, there was a female wearing a veil that attacked him during his breakthrough. Originally, he thought that she was going to kill him, it wasn\u2019t until that final moment, he found out that this really wasn\u2019t the case. She had just wanted to assist him with breaking through, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have been able to block any of the strikes from that veiled female.At that time, Kai Yang already had his suspicions about the identity of the lady, and now he had finally been able to confirm the identity of that veiled female.Once he did so his heart filled with appreciation for his senior Xia.Unfortunately old man Meng jumped into between Kai Yang and Xia Ning Chang, interrupting their sweet moment. And, like a mother hen protecting her little chicks, he protected his treasured disciple.Suspiciously, Kai Yang looked towards him, asking: \u201cYou know each other?\u201dSnorting, Meng Wu Ya showed a face full of pride and righteousness: \u201cThis is my disciple!\u201d\u201cYour disciple?\u201d Kai Yang\u2019s jaw nearly fell to ground as his eyes continuously flitted between Xia Ning Chang and Meng Wu Ya in complete disbelief.He never would have thought, he truly never would have thought it. That such an irresponsible man like Treasurer Meng would actually accept a disciple. This couldn\u2019t be a accidental or false disciple could it?\u201cYou two\u2026\u2026..know each other?\u201d Glancing to the side, Meng Wu Ya asked Kai Yang.\u201cWe don\u2019t know each other!\u201d Xia Ning Chang\u2019s response was extremely clear and firm, leaving no room for argument. As she replied, she also moved to hide behind Meng Wu Ya, positioning her hands in a defensive manner.Kai Yang took the hint and chuckled: \u201cIt can\u2019t be counted as knowing each other. It\u2019s just that on that night, senior sister helped me with a small matter.\u201dMeng Wu Ya nodded his head. Xia Ning Chang had already informed him regarding this matter, and if it wasn\u2019t for that night\u2019s matter, then she wouldn\u2019t have found out that Kai Yang had such pure Yang type World Qi.\u201cTreasurer Meng, what type of task does senior sister need my help for? Could you please tell me?\u201d He asked with an inquisitive look. Since it was related to Xia Ning Chang he wouldn\u2019t reject the request no matter the task.Instead of replying, Meng Wu Ya turned to his beloved disciple and inquired: \u201cIs he okay?\u201dXia Ning Chang\u2019s delicate earlobes suddenly reddened, lowering her eyes one could see her long eyelashes were trembling. Only after a good while did she tentatively nod her head.Seeing her act like this, Meng Wu Ya couldn\u2019t help but let out a small sigh of exasperation: \u201cStop, stop, stop. Since time is limited, it will be him.\u201dStanding to side, Kai Yang observed the proceedings without saying a word.A few minutes later, Meng Wu Ya suddenly started to speak in a serious tone: \u201cKai Yang, you should know that on this earth, there are certain types of people that are different from ordinary people. These people possess skills and abilities that normal people can\u2019t possibly fathom.\u201dKai Yang could only stare blankly before softly responding: \u201cTreasurer Meng, you are talking about those people who have a special physique?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He answered while nodding his head, \u201cThese people are protected by the heavens, and are the children of the heavens. Some are gifted in cultivating, others can heal quicker than others, while other physiques are more suited to battling. There are various types of physiques, coming in all shapes and forms, but no matter who it is, as long as they possess a special physique they are subjected to the envy of others. It\u2019s just, those who possess special physiques are extremely rare; you might not even find one in a million people. Little Kai Yang, you are very lucky because today you are blessed enough to see someone with a special physique.\u201dIn shock, Kai Yang glanced at Xia Ning Chang who was currently hiding behind Meng Wu Ya: \u201cDon\u2019t tell me it\u2019s senior sister\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHe he\u2026\u2026..\u201d With a face full of arrogance, Meng Wu Ya grinned from his heart, nodding his head he replied: \u201cThat\u2019s right. Ning Chang is different from ordinary people.\u201dKai Yang\u2019s heart was going up and down. Never in a thousand instances would he have thought this little and easily shy senior sister was actually someone who possessed a special physique.\u201cWhat is special about senior sister?\u201d Kai Yang couldn\u2019t help but curiously ask.Meng Wu Ya didn\u2019t reply but instead sank into contemplation while muttering to himself, finally saying: \u201cThese fruits on the tree have just matured, so my dear disciple, turn them into pills.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Xia Ning Chang walked up to the Three Sun\u2019s Fruit Tree and lightly plucked the ripe fruits from its branches.Kai Yang didn\u2019t ask anything, he felt that all his questions would soon be answered.\u201cMy disciple, let him see some of your might.\u201d Meng Wu Ya chuckled.Xia Ning Chang nodded her head then walked up to Kai Yang. Taking one of her white jade hands she placed the fruits on the palm of her hand.\u201cPlease watch junior brother.\u201d Xia Ning Chang quietly instructed him, before activating her World Qi.Kai Yang was extremely shocked. This was because as she activated her World Qi, he saw that the from within the fruits, out surged a glowing red energy.The Yang energy within the fruits burst out. Since Kai Yang cultivated the True Yang Tactics, he was extremely sensitive to Yang energy. Currently he could clearly feel the the energy within the Three Sun\u2019s Fruits, violently bursting outwards.But\u2026\u2026how did this happen?The energy that came from within the fruits converged in front of Xia Ning Chang. Once all the energy had been extracted from the the fruits, Kai Yang watched as they deflated without an ounce of Yang Qi to be sensed within them before disintegrating into the wind. This process all happened in the span of ten breaths.Xia Ning Chang moved again; one hand held the extracted energy, while the other hand performed some unknown movements in the air.Then the Yang Qi from within Coiling Dragon Stream rushed towards her in one solid stream. With a motion of her hand, Xia Ning Chang grabbed that qi and added to the already condensed red coloured energy from the fruits.As time went on, her grabbing speed became faster and faster as each handful of Yang Qi assimilated with the red energy from the fruits in her palm.Though as more energy was poured in, not only did the accumulated energy not expand, it actually decreased in size.But the energy within the energy ball was becoming stronger and stronger.A few minutes later, Xia Ning Chang finally stopped seizing Yang Qi from Coiling Dragon Stream, she then used her two hands to squeeze the energy ball.Her two hands quickly clasped together and when she reopened her hands again, there were three bright red pills within her palm. The pills were smooth and round, with a alluring luster, not to mention the pill marks were all clearly visible.Watching this had long since caused Kai Yang to stare blankly ahead with no reaction!The scene that had played out, apart from using peak level skills, there was no possible way to explain it.It was only at that moment, did Kai Yang realise how his senior sister had obtained that bottle of pills. They were refined by her in such a manner!But, wasn\u2019t that too easy and simple? Receiptair masters were originally rare, and along with the successful refinement of pills, there would always be many failures. Not to mention when receiptair masters refined pills, they required the usage of special tools, examples of which would be furnaces, fire, etc.But senior sister Xia had only used her hands, and apart from the Three Sun\u2019s Fruit, she didn\u2019t use any other materials, yet she so easily crafted those three pills.\u201cFor you!\u201d Putting her hand in front of Kai Yang, she offered the pills to him.Taking in a deep breath, Kai Yang calmed his flustered heart before taking the pills from her. Then he carefully inspected each pill and discovered that each and every one of them held Yang Qi that was far richer and denser than the original fruit. Afterall, when Xia Ning Chang was refining the pills, she had also added Yang Qi from Coiling Dragon Stream.\u201cSenior sister, if you were to start refining pills, then the current sellers would have no customers left.\u201d Kai Yang said as he forced out a bitter smile. Never had he seen someone simplify pill refinement to such a degree.p.s. A make up chapter for yesterday's missing chapter. Wow, things have gotten unsual but interesting. Kai Yang's future career: Receiptair? Well then guys, please wait for the next installment, ahem chapter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 83": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Martial PeakChapter 84 \u2013 Holy Spirit Pill BodyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNote: SORRY! I'M VERY SORRY! I couldn't connect to the internet and other things. I tried posting from my phone, but my copy and paste wouldn't paste it. Here's your long awaited chapter after much wait, and you guys finally get to know why Xia need KY's help. Will post another chapter later too.Chapter 84 \u2013 Holy Spirit Pill BodyI\u2019m afraid even those renowned pill masters wouldn\u2019t even come close to possessing an ability like Xia Ning Chang\u2019s.\u201cWhat special body do you have senior sister?\u201d Kai Yang asked.\u201dMeng Wu Ya replied: \u201cHoly Spirit Pill Body!\u201d\u201cUsed for pill making?\u201d\u201cNot bad.\u201d Meng Wu Ya nodded his head, \u201cThese physiques are extremely unique. For those people who possess a Holy Spirit Pill Body, they can make pills without any sort of side-effects or backlashes. You should know that all medicines contain one third poison, and although they can increase a practitioner\u2019s strength, the benefit they can provide is limited. But for pills made utilizing the Holy Spirit Pill Body, the body is able to refine the poison away. Up until now, your senior sister has only cultivated for five years, today she is at the separation and reunion boundary and if I hadn\u2019t deliberately suppressed her ability, then I\u2019m certain that she would have reached the true element boundary already.Kai Yang was astonished, in a period of five years, she had already cultivated to the separation and reunion boundary. Xie Hong Chen was also only that this stage, but how many years had it taken him? It should have been around ten years. Not to mention senior sister had done this under suppression, so if she wasn\u2019t suppressed, then wouldn\u2019t she be more powerful than Su Yan?Kai Yang was embarrassed to death, for his aptitude paled in comparison to the person in front of him. I was simply something on the ground, gazing up at something in the sky.This person was the number one genius in the entire Sky Tower!But for Xia Ning Chang to have such rapid growth, you couldn\u2019t forget the large amount of assistance she had received from cultivation pills.Meng Wu Ya continued to speak: \u201cNot only are there advantages to the Holy Spirit Pill Body, if you cultivate it with a suitable skill, then, as long as they had energy,, one would be able to refine anything under the sky. Take the qi in the air for example, as long as my disciple is willing, she would also be able to refine it into pills.\u201dAs long as it had energy, anything under the sky was refinable into pills! Since the energy in the earth and heavens were refinable, then you didn\u2019t need to talk about the Three Sun\u2019s Fruit.Kai Yang could see that in the future, this Senior Xia will be the best alchemist master in the entire world. Born with this type of body, nobody would be able to match her prowess.\u201cThis time, in order for her to breakthrough into the next boundary, she needs to refine and form something within her body. As for this thing, she is unable to do it herself.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s why you need my help?\u201d Kai Yang asked.Meng Wu Ya nodded his head.\u201cWhat type of thing?\u201d\u201cNine Yin Dew Crystals. These things are extremely helpful to those in the true element boundary. So if she were able to refine and form this thing, then it would help to prevent anything from hindering her cultivation.\u201dTo go from the separation and reunion boundary into the true element boundary, one must change their World Qi into True Qi, which is far more pure and powerful. This was also a process that all practitioners needed to undertake, and if this process was accompanied by some precious treasure, then the transformed True Qi would more powerful than normal.This Nine Yin Dew Crystals, were clearly such a precious treasure and were definitely one of the best treasures.\u201cThe Nine Yin Dew Crystals are naturally a spirit essence, and obtaining them is extremely hard. And if it were used by people who were not suitable, then it would immediately melt and disappear. Only those who cultivated Yang Qi, would be able to control them. Not to mention that the purity of their Yang World Qi must reach a certain degree. That is also the reason why we need your help.\u201d\u201cWhat the exact things do I need to do?\u201d Kai Yang questioned.Suddenly Meng Wu Ya became really impatient: \u201cWhy are you asking so much, you will know when the time comes.\u201dKai Yang pinched the bridge of his nose, and wondered why old man Meng would be this angry.\u201cWhere is this thing? When are we leaving to retrieve it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s in Black Wind Mountain. Over there, some Nine Yins have gathered. And only on the 7th of July, will the Nine Yin Qi truly gather, and only then would you be able to retrieve its Yin Qi.\u201d\u201cThen there isn\u2019t much time left.\u201d Kai Yang pondered as he calculated; there was only ten days until 7th of July. If you needed to enter Black Wind Mountains, then journeying in would also take some time.\u201cSo if you don\u2019t have anything to do, then I would like to hurry over now. Otherwise, we would have to wait another year for it.\u201d Meng Wu Ya spoke solemnly.\u201cI can depart anytime.\u201d Kai Yang smiled.\u201cThen come to the Contribution Hall to find me in two days, because I still need to prepare some things.\u201d Meng Wu Ya warmly replied.\u201cOkay, then we\u2019ll meet in two days time.\u201dWith the date set, both parties met two days later in the Contribution Hall and departed.Looking at his receding back, Meng Wu Ya let out a small sigh, his expression oddly queer. You couldn\u2019t tell what he was thinking, and only after a good while did he speak: \u201cMy disciple, are you certain that you want to do this?\u201dXia Ning Chang\u2019s clothes fluttered as she nodded her head: \u201cEn.\u201dMeng Wu Ya continued: \u201cIf you truly aren\u2019t able to refine the Nine Yin Dew Crystals, you are still able to breakthrough, it\u2019s just that your future power would be slightly weaker.\u201dXia Ning Chang lightly laughed: \u201cBut, if I want to help master, then wouldn\u2019t it be better with purer True Qi? Master you saved me and raised me, disciple also wants to help you.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u2026.ai, why don\u2019t you think over it again?\u201dThe reason for the two days of delay, was because Meng Wu Ya wanted Xia Ning Chang to think it over again.Blushing, Xia Ning Chang replied: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I really don\u2019t hate him.\u201dMeng Wu Ya sighed out knowingly: \u201cWe took advantage of the kid.\u201dThinking about Kai Yang\u2019s indifferent manner, Meng Wu Ya became so hateful that his tooth started to itch. You only know that you are here to help with a favour, but you don\u2019t know how much you will be taken advantage of.By all means, sparks must not be created or fly! In the end, this little place isn\u2019t something where his disciple will settle, Meng Wu Ya worried anxiously, he intestines tied in a knot.Kai Yang didn\u2019t return to Su Yan\u2019s wooden house, but instead returned to his secluded wooden hut, which he hadn\u2019t visited in many days. Although it had been quite some while since he had last been here, it was still as clean and tidy as before. Not even a speck of dust could be seen. He wondered who it could have been, that had been tidying his hut.Although Treasurer Meng had been very vague, Kai Yang still knew the brief details on where he was going and what he needed to do.Since it was the place that the Nine Yin gathered, then the Yin Qi would be extremely dense. And his Yang Qi is the perfect bane of the Yin Qi, so there wasn\u2019t much to worry about. It was just that his current cultivation was far too low, so he needed to stockpile some Yang Liquid, so he wouldn\u2019t suffer too much in a drawn out battle.It was just by chance that his Senior Xia had refined all of his Three Sun\u2019s Fruits into pills, which was a good replenishment for his Yang Liquid Drops.Four Three Sun\u2019s Fruit Trees, each tree grew three fruits, totalling twelve bright red pills. And each pill allowed him to form three drops of Yang Liquid, so he had condensed a total of thirty-six Yang Drops.These drops, whether or not they were used in battle or used to defend against the Yin Qi, they would be extremely helpful. These were the things he would rely on to survive.By taking an entire day, Kai Yang finally managed to refine all twelve pills and condense out the Yang Liquid Drops.When he had condensed them, not only had he condensed thirty-six drops, but an extra 4 drops as well for a total of forty drops. If you added the drops he already possessed within his diantian, then he had quite a haul.This time round, he finally had some advantage.When he had condensed and refined all the Yang Liquid Drops and pills, Kai Yang found out he had broken through into the initial element fourth stage.This breakthrough was truly too sudden, without any forewarning, but the breakthrough had been extremely fluid, like water; without him feeling anything in particular.Thinking it over, Kai Yang came to the conclusion that it was probably due to the large amounts of cultivation pills he had eaten these past few days, followed by twelve Yang pills. The convergence of this large amount of energy, enabling him to breakthrough isn\u2019t something inconceivable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Martial PeakChapter 85 \u2013 Dark TidePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 85 \u2013 Dark TideTranslator \u2013 LuffyEditor \u2013 Ben &amp; ErzaEarly in the morning of the second day, standing before the contribution hall gate, Kai Yang knocked gently on the door.After sometime, the front door opened, and Xia Ning Chang came out from within. From her shoulder hung an arm length package, containing many things.\u201cJunior brother you came.\u201d Xia Ning Chang greeted him in a soft voice .\u201cEn.\u201d Kai Yang nodded, \u201cWhere is Treasurer Meng?\u201d\u201cYesterday he had a sudden resurgence of an old illness, he has left to heal, so he cannot come with us.\u201d Xia Ning Chang explained, her pair of eyes blinking incessantly, the two rows of eyelashes trembled like miniature fans.Kai Yang looked at her suspiciously, and Xia Ning Chang\u2019s eyes flashed with a trace of panic.\u201cDo we need to wait for him?\u201d Although Kai Yang had guessed what had happened already, he didn\u2019t expose anything.\u201cNo need, I know the location of that place and time is running out. Master said that we do not need to wait for him.\u201d Seeing Kai Yang didn\u2019t enquire further, Xia Ning Chang relaxed her heart.\u201cOkay then.\u201d Kai Yang hesitated slightly before complying.\u201cThis time I will trouble junior brother.\u201d Xia Ning Chang said in one breath.\u201cElder Sister is too polite.\u201d Kai Yang exhibited a faint smile.Swiftly, the two people left the Contribution Hall.In the Contribution Hall\u2019s inner chamber, Treasurer Meng was currently asleep. On the table lay plates of various exquisite dishes, as well as few pots of wine; it looked like treasurer Meng had fallen asleep after drinking some good wine.The dishes on the table were made by Xia Ning Chang but each had a special seasoning. This seasoning was refined using her Holy Spirit Pill Body. This grade of medicine couldn\u2019t even be resisted by someone at Meng Wu Ya\u2019s level.As for the duration of his sleep, it should last for a few days!Meng Wu Ya throughout his entire life, had always been shrewd and would have never expected that someday he would fall at the hands of his own beloved disciple.It was estimated that by the time Meng Wu Ya woke up, everything would already have occurred.Kai Yang and Xia Ning Chang arrived at the Black Plum Village, where they bought two horses and some daily necessities they would require for the long journey ahead.While shopping Kai Yang also enquired about the location of their destination. According to Xia Ning Chang, their destination was about nine-ten days away from Black Plum Village. They would have to cross into Black Wind Mountain. Although the journey would be long, they had plenty of time.Shortly after the two left the village, news of them was passed to Xie Hong Chen\u2019s ears.Since the day he saw Su Yan and Kai Yang being intimate in the Forest Prison, Xie Hong Chen had drunk large quantities of wine for several days in frustration. He had finally returned to his normal life yesterday. After thinking it over clearly, he thought that it should not have been exactly as he saw it.Su Yan\u2019s temperament was one which Xie Hong Chen was very clear of. With her arrogance and strength, how could she be intimate with trash like Kai Yang? Furthermore, they absolutely don\u2019t have any thing in common and probably hadn\u2019t met prior to the incident at the Forest Prison, so they were basically strangers.After thinking it over Xie Hong Chen came to the conclusion that Su Yan and Kai Yang were acting that day. At the time, due to envy and hate making his blood boil and cloud his mind, he had been unable to think clearly.But after thinking it over, Xie Hong Chen\u2019s spirit was greatly restored. Yesterday when saw Su Yan display the same beauty and elegance as always, he was no longer crazy and didn\u2019t lose his self-control like he had that day.Although that had been explosive news from Su Yan, after this revelation, the knot in Xie Hong Chen\u2019s heart disappeared.So long as Su Yan had not been obtained by other men, then sooner or later she would be his. Xie Hong Chen was very self-confident about it. After all he was Sky Tower\u2019s most outstanding male disciple and Su Yan was the most outstanding female disciple. The union of the two of them was naturally one all the elders were willing to see.Early in the morning, Xie Hong Chen carefully prepared, as he wanted to go and see Su Yan later in Black Wind Trade.But when he was just about to go out, a disciplinary disciple suddenly ran up to him in a hurry, with a flushed face, he said \u201dBrother Xie, I just saw Kai Yang leave the Sky Tower a moment ago\u201d.Xie Hong Chen listened to this and smartly asked, \u201cDid he leave alone?\u201d\u201cNo, he departed with a Dark Hall disciple called Xie Ning Chang\u201d. The disciplinary disciple replied.\u201cXia Ning Chang!\u201d Xie Hong Chen narrowed his eyes, \u201cI know her. Her strength is equal to mine, but she is not a core disciple, this woman is quite strange.\u201d\u201cWhere did they go?\u201d Xie Hong Chen, at that moment, had a crazy look in his eyes. God have mercy, that waste actually left the tower at such time, it was as if he was asking to be killed off. This was just the solution to solve the hate in my heart!\u201cI don't know their destination but evidently it must be far, because they purchased two horses in Black Plum Village.\u201d\u201cThat far?\u201d Xie Hong Chen raised his brows. \u201cOk, good, good\u2026..\u201dXie Hong Chen suddenly turned, and with a twisted face, said: \u201cLook for several disciples whose strength is at least at the separation and reunion boundary to accompany me on a trip.\u201d\u201cBrother what do you want to do?\u201d\u201cHe he, what I want to do, I am not clear enough? Do you want to ask again.\u201d Xie Hong Chen\u2019s facial features distorted. He wanted to chase down the rival, to get rid of Kai Yang, all the while keeping Xia Ning Chang in the dark. After all, if news of this was leaked, the consequences would not be a joke.\u201cBrother, this is improper.\u201d That disciplinary disciple\u2019s face turned pale, because Kai Yang was only a initial element stage trial disciple, so even if he did die outside the school, nobody would care. But that Dark Hall disciple, Xia Ning Chang, was different. Her background was unclear, but since she had reached the separation and reunion boundary in strength, she definitely was not an insignificant person. If she died and Sky Tower started to investigate, then the brothers who participated would be chased and have no other choice but to leave Sky Tower.\u201cI told you to go find some people, so what are you still standing here for?\u201d Xie Hong Chen said impatiently, \u201cDo you want me to go and personally find them?\u201dBecause of jealousy Xie Hong Chen had become possessed, he couldn\u2019t maintain his original calm state of mind. He only held ideas about killing Kai Yang now.\u201cBrother, after the previous matter, the Grand Elder strictly ordered that, nobody is allowed to fight Kai Yang. Did you forget Elder\u2019s warning?\u201dHearing this reminder caused Xie Hong Chen to regain control of himself. That\u2019s right, last time, the Grand Elder had suddenly announced that nobody was allowed to make trouble for Kai Yang for a short period of time. This instruction had made everybody bewildered. However Xie Hong Chen didn\u2019t care about it; how could he let such an excellent opportunity pass in vain?It was such a good opportunity, did he really have to watch it pass by? If he didn\u2019t kill Kai Yang this time, then he must wait till god knows when. What would he do later if he chose to stay within Sky Tower and refused to leave?He was not willing to let go of this chance, the disciplinary disciple thought of something something and said with a sly smile: \u201dBrother Xie, we cannot get involved, but others may like to get involved. I think that plenty of people would be willing to take this opportunity if they knew of it.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Xie Hong Chen narrowed his eyes and asked.\u201cIt is said that the Blood Group\u2019s Vice-head Long Zai Tian, has been enquiring about news regarding Kai Yang this past month.\u201dLong Zai Tian, Xie Hong Chen naturally knew knew him as he was a popular person in the Blood Group and his strength was also at the immortal ascension boundary. But his grandson wasn\u2019t quite as outstanding; this year he was probably only at the qi refining boundary.Xie Hong Chen was confused: \u201cWhy would Long Zai Tian be enquiring about Kai Yang?\u201dThat person couldn\u2019t help but sigh exasperatedly: \u201cLong Zai Tian has been pursuing Hu Mei Er, that seductive girl, for his grandson and has been regarding her as his own already. But relationship between Kai Yang and Hu Mei Er is unclear, so Long Zai Tian said that Kai Yang must die. Teaching him the consequences of having any ideas about touching someone else\u2019s woman.\u201d\u201cHu Mei Er!\u201d In Xie Hong Chen\u2019s mind, a large breasted female appeared, with a curling upward buttock, and a charming young girl\u2019s figure. His breath suddenly became very heavy.That seductive girl excels in stimulating people and almost every disciple from the three schools had heard about her. Xie Hong Chen had also seen her once.\u201cThat waste truly isn\u2019t somebody good. He unexpectedly has a relationship with that seductive girl!\u201d Although righteous words were coming from Xie Hong Chen mouth, in his heart he was actually cursing angrily.After thinking for some time, he doubtfully stated: \u201cSomething\u2019s not right. Such detailed news, where did you obtain it from?\u201dEven if Long Zai Tian wanted to take Kai Yang\u2019s life, he wouldn\u2019t announce it far and wide; if it was widely known, would it not alert his enemy? If Kai Yang knew about this, would he still have the courage to leave Sky Tower?The disciplinary disciple\u2019s complexion changed slightly as he knew the details but didn\u2019t know how to answer the question.\u201cTell me!\u201d Xie Hong Chen commanded him sternly.\u201cYes!\u201d The disciplinary disciple desperately spluttered out: \u201cA few days ago when I was in the Spring Wind Rain House in Black Plum Village. . . . . drinking, Long Zai Tian happened to be in the next room. So I listened in to his discussion with the female in next room.\u201d\u201cSpring Wind Rain House!\u201d Xie Hong Chen looked at that fellow ill-humoredly with one eye. He couldn\u2019t have been there just for drinking.That person hurriedly continued: \u201cBrother Xie, if Long Zai Tian was to know about this news, he will not let Kai Yang off easily and we won\u2019t need to get our hands dirty. Long Zai Tian is lusty by nature, if we tell him this, he will know that Kai Yang has a beautiful woman by his side, how do you think he will react?\u201dXie Hong Chen\u2019s face lit up and he coldly smiled before praising the disciple, \u201cIngenious plan!\u201dThis move of murdering with a borrowed knife, was a good plan. Hesitating slightly, he then said: \u201dSince Long Zai Tian wants to look for him, pass the news to him, but this matter should be kept secret. Do not reveal anything that exposes you. For Long Zai Tian absolutely mustn\u2019t know that this news was passed by us. Also tell him that the female with Kai Yang has cultivation at the separation and reunion boundary, so he doesn\u2019t try to capture the chicken but lose the rice he lured it with.\u201cYes!\u201d that person said before quickly going away.Kai Yang, this time let\u2019s see how you escape death. It\u2019s just a pity\u2026\u2026\u2026.. Xia Ning Chang wears a veil all day, and although he has never seen her appearance, Xie Hong Chen was almost certain that she was an outstandingly beautiful female.If such a female fell into Long Zai Tian hands, her fate was more than certain. At that moment, Xie Hong Chen somewhat envied the luck of Long Zai Tian.The Sky Tower Pavilion, the Disciplinary Hall began they all began to make trouble; someone in Black Plum Village was also making trouble.After Kai Yang and Xia Ning Chang departed on horseback, a group of people came out from hiding. The leader\u2019s face was cold, and after staring at Kai Yang\u2019s back, he asked: \u201d Did you see clearly, was that person Kai Yang?\u201d\u201cAbsolutely. I saw clearly brother Nu Lang, he was Kai Yang without a doubt. Previously we were beaten up by him, after this Cheng Shao Feng went to look for Brother Nu Tao. He said he would find an opportunity to teach him lesson. So they went to Black Wind Trade one day and never came back.\u201dNu Lang\u2019s complexion became hazy, he waved his hand saying: \u201cBuy some horses, we must follow them. I must know the whereabouts of my younger brother, and whether he is alive or dead.\u201dNu Tao and Cheng Shao Feng had been missing for more than one month now. Nu Lang had looked everywhere for them but had been unable to find them, and during his inquires the name Kai Yang arose multiple times.He didn\u2019t know the real situation, but he must pursue Kai Yang to ask about it. If his younger brother died by his hand, as an elder brother he must take revenge for the younger brother.p.s. So the second chapter of the day as promised. Also this was done by Luffy, a potential new translator. This chapter was like a tester chapter and trial, if they think it's alright they will continue translating, and that means potential more chapters per week. But in the end, it's all up to the new tester tl-er. Let's hope for the best though.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 85": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Martial PeakChapter 86 \u2013 Following at the heelsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 86 \u2013 Following at the heelsTranslator \u2013 Erza &amp; LuffyEditor \u2013 BenNu Lang\u2019s group of people, with him as the leader, prepared to set out. Since he had recently broken through into the qi transforming stage, his World Qi had yet to stabilize. For martial practitioners at this level, they were the most easily agitated by this type of flurry of emotions tumbling through them, Nu Lang was no exception. The remaining seven to eight people were only at the tempered body stage, with a few at the initial element stage, but overall they weren\u2019t too high leveled in their cultivation. It was just their numbers that were great.As for Kai Yang\u2019s cultivation, Nu Lang naturally knew of course, so he didn\u2019t really put it in his eyes. It was only the female next to Kai Yang that didn\u2019t seem to be easily provoked.But after thinking over it carefully, this female didn\u2019t seem too strong. Looking at her, her age didn\u2019t seem to be very old and she didn\u2019t seem to be any of the famous Sky Tower disciples he had heard of or knew about.Also, if her strength was truly high, why would she need to buy horses to travel? Once you reached a certain cultivation stage, just by relying on your feet, you would be many times faster than a horse.(TL: Monsters -_-)Analysing it so, Nu Lang\u2019s worries dissipated.Unbeknownst to him, the reason why Xia Ning Chang purchased the horses, was due to her concern for Kai Yang. Afterall, Kai Yang was only at the initial element fourth stage, so how fast could his feet possibly be?This group of disciples from Storm House started to follow their hoof prints, whilst hiding in the bushes and shadows.As Kai Yang and Xia Ning Chang were urging their horses, they didn\u2019t know that two groups had followed and trapped them in a pincer formation. Not only that, both groups harboured malicious intent.Even though Xia Ning Chang\u2019s cultivation wasn\u2019t bad, she still had yet to reach the stage where she could use her divine sense. This caused her to be unable to sense all the things that were occurring the surrounding area.Since the two were rushing on their journey, they didn\u2019t really say anything to each other. With Xia Ning Chang leading the way at the front and Kai Yang following closely behind, the two rode their horses in a straight line.It wasn\u2019t until nightfall, that the two people found a water source to settle down at for the night.Sitting near the bonfire in a circle, they ate the food they had bought from Black Plum Village.From just one day together, Kai Yang had become quite familiar with this senior sister\u2019s nature. She is timid, shy and she when talked her ears turn red. She also always speaks softly, as soft as the wind, as if it was natural for her.Because of her nature, Kai Yang didn\u2019t take the initiative to talk to her, so as to avoid frightening the opposite party.Ever since he understood the character of the mysterious golden skeleton and gained an understanding of the mystical martial skill, he discovered that his True Yang Tactics had changed.At present, Kai Yang\u2019s True Yang Tactics could absorb Yang Qi and then condense it into Yang Liquid.But now, not having a Yang environment, he can practice the true Yang Tactics to absorb the energy in the air, which can then be refined to form Yang Qi which then could be absorbed into the golden skeleton.Environmental constraints for practicing this skill had suddenly disappeared. For Kai Yang this was great news which brought him a great deal of happiness.After riding for three days on the road, they finally arrived at a small town thousands of miles from Sky Tower.With Xia Ning Chang words, they no longer needed horses for the rest of the journey, only the mountains were ahead.In town they stabled their horses and found an inn to stay at for the time being.According to Xia Ning Chang they couldn\u2019t use horses for journey ahead, because of the hilly nature of the terrain.Xia Ning Chang was very irritated, after all she had asked him for help &amp; had been neglecting him unexpectedly, and it really cannot be justified.Kai Yang &amp; Xia Ning Chang lived in adjoining rooms, in a brightly lit room, Kai Yang was meditating and practicing. Meanwhile Xie Ning Chang was indulge in a flight of fancy.But each time she tried to talk to him, at the last moment she can\u2019t help but get discouraged. She has been used to observing him secretly, but now suddenly has contact with him face to face &amp; does not know what to do.Moreover, this fellow is also an uncommunicative person, if she talked to him can that make him dislike her?While Xia Ning Chang is worrying about this, in the inn there are another two groups quietly watching these two peoples movements.In another candle lit room, Long Hui sits with the members of the Blood Group.On Long Hui\u2019s face is a frown. After the Blood Group obtained the news, they started the pursuit, although a little late they were finally able to catch up.Breaking the silence, Long Hui said suddenly, \u201cLord Wen, when do we begin? Kai Yang, that boy is in this inn. Given Lord Wen\u2019s skill, it is a simple matter to seize him, is it not?\u201dWen Fei Chen is a middle aged man, his strength has reached the true element boundary fifth layer. He is a leader of a fraction of the Blood Group. Because the news obtained by Long Hui is accurate, he asked the lord to accompany them for the purpose of capturing Xia Ning Chang alive.Beside this group of people of Wen Fei Chen, outside there is also many separation and reunion boundary\u2019s masters, they number around six or seven. It looks like, Long Hui took steps to ensure that the plan is foolproof, it can even be described as a fanfare.Wen Fei Chen smiled, \u201cYoung master Long, if you want me to begin, we can begin at any time, although this is a small town, with my strength, wanting to deal with them is an easy matter, people on the side will not be alarmed and no clues will be left behind.\u201d\u201cThen what are we waiting for? \u201cLong Hui looks inspired, \u201cKai Yang must die and that female must be captured alive, it is said she is very beautiful. Since he dares to have ideas on my women, then this road goes other way too, I will have a taste of his women.\u201dWen Fei Chen knows long Hui\u2019s nature and has anticipated this response, he then said, \u201cBut master Long one must think, why have they rushed to this place from afar?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Long Hui asked.Wei Fei Chen hesitated for a moment, then said, \u201cI believe that their trip has a goal for sure. Perhaps\u2026\u2026 they must enter Black Wind Mountain, seeking some treasure!\u201dLong Hui\u2019s brows wrinkled, \u201cThis does not have anything to do with us. In Black Wind Mountain many people go looking for treasure, but are lost to never come back again.\u201dWei Fei Chen shakes his head saying, \u201cMaster Long this is incorrect, they can enter Black Wind Mountain from Sky Tower, but they have actually ridden horses for thousands of miles before finally stopping here. If I have not guessed wrongly, tomorrow they will enter the mountain from here. Their goals are quite explicit, and then it is simple to confirm this matter. They know what they are looking for and where to find it. If we follow in behind quietly, when they have found it\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe has to say the observation of Wei Fei Chen is very exquisite, the analysis is also quite accurate, worthy is a man of wisdom.Long Hui\u2019s expression at present is bright, \u201cWhen they find it we can go and rob!\u201dWei Fei Chen smiles, \u201cIt is as master Long said. However if master Long cannot wait for the beautiful woman, I can get her tonight, I will not let you down.\u201dLong Hui hesitated slightly and looked a bit confused.Wen Fei Chen is good at tunneling into his thoughts, \u201cBut if master Long waits for several days, not only may he have the beautiful woman, treasure young master may also have. Think if they spend untold hardship to seek the treasure and it was snatched by us. That Kai Yang, will he not be spitting blood madly?\u201dListening to him Long Hui looks stearn, \u201cGood, if they run, in any case the Buddhist priest cannot escape the temple, then let Kai Yang live for several more days, while we obtain the advantage without labor like elderly fishermen!\u201dThen Wei Fei Chen said with a light smile, \u201cEndurance is uncommon; Master long is destined to do great things.\u201d\u201cHa, the Lord Wen over praises.\u201d Long Hui was swallowing his flattery comfortably.p.s. It's official, there is a new translator that will be helping me translate. Hopefully that means more chapters, so say hello and thank you for the chapter.

Now that he is with young master Long, he must try to curry favor with him, for future benefits.The discussions in the room had finally ended so everyone got ready to get some rest. Suddenly from opposite side of the door came a gentle knock.\u201cCome in!\u201d Wen Fei Chen said lightly.The door opened and a Blood Group disciple walked in from outside. Giving a salute to Long Hui he then whispered something into Wei Fei Chen\u2019s ear softly.Wei Fei Chan\u2019s face changed immediately, \u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201dHe then signaled several disciples in the room and ordered them: \u201cGo and seize those people. Do not let them escape, as it would be bad for master Long\u2019s plan.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d several people in room complied and hastily moved out.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Long Hui urgently asked.Wei Fei Chen ha- ha smiles, \u201cMaster Long this matter is very interesting. Remember when we were travelling here, along the way there were many horse hoof prints on the road. According to news which I just received we are not the only ones pursuing Kai Yang\u2019s \u2026\u2026. kill him. It looks like we have company.\u201cOh?\u201d Long Hui sounded surprised \u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cSeveral small disciples from Storm House. At this very moment they are preparing to attack Kai Yang, it looks like they can\u2019t deal with Kai Yang when he is together with that female.\u201d\u201cThey will be bringing their own destruction.\u201d Long Hui sneered and continued, \u201cWhat does Lord Wen want to do with them?\u201d\u201cNaturally I cannot let master Long\u2019s important plan be ruined.\u201d Wen Fei Chen said while bowing slightly.The sound of people talking on the opposite side of door can be heard before many people burst into the room through the door. These are the disciples from the Blood Group who went out a moment ago and it looks like they all came back uninjured accompanied by startled face Nu Lang.Nu Lang\u2019s group was very frightened, they had managed to pursue Kai Yang with great difficulty and just when they were planning to bust into the room and capture Kai Yang to enquire about the missing Nu Tao and Cheng Shao Feng they were captured.Who would have thought that before they could execute their plan, they would be surrounded by a group of devils, whose strength surpassed even their leader.Nu Lang was scared shitless after being released, he hastily kowtowed to beg for mercy, \u201cSeniors, we didn\u2019t offend you, right? This one pleads for you to spare us.\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d A Blood Group disciple waved his arm and hit him hard with his palm, Nu Lang\u2019s mouth became bloody due to the hit, he felt very indignant but didn\u2019t dare to say anything and could only shut up and listen obediently.Nu Lang nervously looked around; the other Storm House disciples were all shivering with fright. Their strength was not very high so they couldn\u2019t even try to escape. Any one of these people was enough to kill them, on top of that there were six-seven people who were encircling them on all sides.Had they bothered anyone recently? The Storm House disciples were also confused, this time they did not annoy anyone on the way, they just came here to catch Kai Yang, but had not even gotten their hands on him before they were captured, how did it became such a big fuss?Nu Lang looked around and suddenly discovered a youth in the opposing group who looked a little familiar, he stared at them with a smile.Thinking carefully, Nu Lang\u2019s facial color changed, probing he asked: \u201cAre you Blood Group\u2019s Long Hui?\u201dLong Hui chuckled: \u201cDo you know me?\u201dNu Lang smiled awkwardly: \u201cNaturally I can recognize you, for I have heard so about Long senior\u2019s descendants.\u201d\u201cSince you are able to recognize me, this matter has become very easy to solve.\u201d Long Hui said lightly.Nu Lang became filled with suspicion, no matter what, he wouldn\u2019t have thought he would meet with people from Blood Group; such a great distance away from home. Meeting old friends far from home, although it is good indeed, but in their present situation\u2026\u2026\u2026weak people need to lower their heads.\u201cI want to ask you, why are you pursuing Kai Yang?\u201d Long Hui asked with squinted eyes.This question caused Nu Lang\u2019s heart to be startled, he looked at Long Hui and did not dare to conceal anything, after telling him the whole story, he says with a long face: \u201cMaster Long, I suspect that the matter of my missing younger brother and Kai Yang are related, if you have a problem, I will immediately bring my people back to Storm House and absolutely will never have any ideas about hurting Kai Yang.\u201dLong Hui smiled: \u201cDo you think that Kai Yang and I are friends?\u201d\u201cIs not it so?\u201d Nu Lang asked timidly.\u201cWhat a joke!\u201d Long Hui sneered: \u201cWhat is this lord\u2019s status, and what is his status, how can we be friends? You have got a pair of blind dog eyes!\u201dNu Lang did not dare to say anything but in his heart he was criticizing, since you are not friends, then why are you disrupting our gratitude and grudges? Isn\u2019t it nosy to mind other\u2019s business.\u201cIt looks like you really do have a pair of blind dog eyes. This time, young master Long has saved your life and unexpectedly you do not know how to thank him.\u201d A Blood Group disciple said reprovingly.Nu Lang looked confused.The Blood Group disciple sneered: \u201cYou only know Kai Yang\u2019s strength to be low, but do you know that the female on his side is a master of the separation and reunion boundary level?\u201dWith these few words, Nu Lang and his group started sweating profoundly, separation and reunion boundary, compared to Nu Lang who is only in the qi transforming stage they have surpassed him by two big boundaries.If they were to have attempted to extract revenge for Nu Tao they would have been annihilated.At this moment Nu Lang knew that he had made a big blunder. Suddenly he was fearful then he rejoiced, he quickly kowtowed over and over again: \u201cMany thanks to young master Long for saving us. My brothers and I are very grateful!\u201dThe group of Storm House disciples hurried to express their gratitude.\u201cWell it looks like you do know how to show gratitude after all.\u201d Long Hui looked to be enjoying himself: \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of telling you the reason for me coming this far. For I am here to take Kai Yang\u2019s life. But it looks like we will need to wait a few more days, because of your actions my plan was nearly ruined.\u201d\u201cThe others and I did not know, but we ask young master Long for his forgiveness.\u201d Nu Lang looked awed.\u201cOk I will not haggle with you over this matter. It looks like everybody\u2019s goal is Kai Yang, and with me you can get to Kai Yang. When we have seized Kai Yang, you may enquire about your younger brother\u2019s whereabouts.\u201dAlthough, Nu Lang\u2019s heart was very uneasy about this, but with the strength of opposite side, how could he dare disobey? At this moment he could only nod and say: \u201cMaster Long I will wait for your instruction come hell or high water, and even risk my life without hesitation!\u201d\u201cGo to your room for now, tomorrow we will find you.\u201dLong Hui said dismissing him with a wave of his hand.\u201cYes!\u201d Nu Lang crawled up from the ground slowly before retreating to wait in his room, only once he was in his room did he realize that his clothes were soaked in sweat.After they had left, Long Hui looked doubtfully at Wen Fei Chen: \u201cLord Wen, why do we need to let them go with us? Their strength is too low and they will easily expose us, our people can easily deal with Kai Yang, we only need to capture that female.\u201dPreviously, what was said was Wen Fei Chen speaking through Long Hui. Although things were going according to plan, Long Hui didn\u2019t analyse it too deeply.p.s. Another chapter out, I do hope you enjoyed the chapter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 87": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Martial PeakChapter 88 \u2013 The Scent of a womanPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 88 \u2013 The Scent of a womanTranslator \u2013 ErzaEditor \u2013 BenHearing the disdain in Long Hui\u2019s voice, Wen Fei Chen smiled: \u201cKilling Kai Yang and capturing that female, naturally we wouldn\u2019t want those people to interfere. But young master Long, since Kai Yang and that girl have decided to enter Black Wind Mountain, then they should have already made preparations for the dangers ahead. But we are different; even our strengths aren\u2019t low, even if we don\u2019t mention those high levelled demonic beasts, there are still various dangers. Just those natural traps and poisons alone, are enough to whittle away at our manpower, but if someone were to walk ahead of us and clear the way, then we wouldn\u2019t need to worry about a thing.\u201dAfter hearing this, Long Hui understood where Wen Fei Chen was going; he wanted to use the Storm House people to scout ahead and avoid any hidden dangers ahead.\u201cEn, Hallmaster Wen truly thinks ahead. I have indeed neglected this point.\u201d Long Hui nodded his head faintly.\u201cYoung Master is naturally gifted, it\u2019s just that you haven\u2019t experienced much of the world yet, so you are still honest and naturally you wouldn\u2019t think of this tactic.\u201d Wen Fei Chen chuckled.As to how they would deal with the Storm House Disciples later, the two came a mutual understanding without saying another word. The female called Xia Ning Chang, at such a young age had already reached the separation and reunion boundary, so she definitely had a powerful supporter teaching her from the shadows. With these types of people, you could either avoid offending them or pluck them out from the roots. So none of the Storm House disciples could be left breathing.Only after arranging the appropriate things, did the Blood Group begin their preparations to enter Black Wind Mountain.The next day, Kai Yang and Xia Ning Chang truly moved according to Wen Fei Chen\u2019s prediction and left the small village, directly entering Black Wind Mountain.Only after half a day had passed did the Blood Group and Storm House people dare to follow after them. Since Xia Ning Chang\u2019s cultivation wasn\u2019t low, if they followed too closely behind them, then she would discover them and if the distance was too great, then they would lose track of them. So half a day\u2019s worth of waiting was more than enough, furthermore, Wen Fei Chen had many years of experience in the Jiang Hu, so he was adept at tracking. He was confident that he wouldn\u2019t be unable to follow the tracks of these two youngsters in the mountains.Entering Black Wind Mountain, Kai Yang and Xia Ning Chang\u2019s speed naturally slowed down.Without the sound of the horses and the distance between them, the two naturally started to converse with each other. In just one day\u2019s worth of time, the two felt their relationship had become closer than ever before.When night fell, Kai Yang and Xia Ning Chang found a tall tree and climbed up its trunk to rest in it for the night.Although the branch was very wide, when the two of them rested upon the branch, there was only a small gap between them, close enough for Kai Yang to smell whiffs of Xia Ning Chang\u2019s scent.\u201cLittle senior sister.\u201d After interacting for a while, there was no longer that feeling of estrangement between them, even the way they addressed each other had changed. This was also due to the fact that Kai Yang felt that Xia Ning Chang was like a child, especially those big round eyes of hers, naive and without any trace of impurity. Even the way she talked was full of simplicity and cuteness.\u201cSenior sister is just senior sister, why do you need to add an extra little?\u201d Xia Ning Chang asked a bit unhappily.\u201cIn that bundle of yours, what did you put inside?\u201d Kai Yang didn\u2019t reply to her answer and instead pointed to the bundle placed next to her.That question had already tormented him for the past four-five days, and Kai Yang couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore so he asked her.\u201cThis eh!\u201d Just like that, Xia Ning Chang was easily diverted from the previous subject. Lifting up the package, she hugged it like it was a treasure and replied: \u201cThese are the materials prepared by master these past years, because if you successfully receive those Nine Yin Dew Crystals, then I must refine them on the spot. The Nine Yin Dew Crystals are a very special, because if you don\u2019t refine them within two hours of obtaining them, they would slowly started to dissipate.\u201d\u201cSo it was like this.\u201d Kai Yang nodded his head in understanding.\u201cJunior brother, ah.\u201d Xia Ning Chang suddenly called out intimately.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cI have a question I want to ask you.\u201d\u201cGood timing, I also have a question I want to ask you.\u201d Kai Yang grinned.\u201cThen we must both honestly answer, alright?\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll start.\u201d Xia Ning Chang said, impatiently.\u201cGo and ahead and ask.\u201d He chuckled: \u201cI promise I won\u2019t lie to you.\u201dPursing her lips, Xia Ning Chang swivelled her body around and hesitated for a moment before asking: \u201cI heard from master, that when he asked you to help him, you made all sorts of excuses to reject him. But when you heard it was me that needed assistance, you swiftly agreed. Why is that?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Kai Yang also turned his head around and asked.Staring at each other\u2019s eyes, Xia Ning Chang\u2019s face became red, and she hurriedly diverted her head and shyly said: \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but master said that you don\u2019t carry good intentions and told me to stay vigilant around you.\u201d\u201cOld man Meng said this?\u201d Kai Yang said angrily.\u201cEn.\u201d Xia Ning Chang trusted her master greatly and replied without any guilt.\u201cThis old man!\u201d This caused Kai Yang to be indignant beyond belief, what did that old man think I was?\u201cThen why did you agree without any hesitation?\u201dGlancing at her, Kai Yang hehe laughed out: \u201cWhat your master said was correct, I truly don\u2019t hold any good intentions towards you. That\u2019s why I agreed so readily!\u201dAs he laughed sardonically, he also slowly inched closer towards Xia Ning Chang.Startled, Xia Ning Chang instinctively retreated backwards, before she suddenly remembered something: \u201cJunior brother, you are unable to defeat me.\u201dThis was actually the truth and Kia Yang considered that if he continued to act brazenly, then he would soon find himself flying out of the tree. Although Xia Ning Chang was innocent and cute, that didn\u2019t mean that she was easily dealt with.Withdrawing his grin, Kai Yang\u2019s expression became serious again and he slowly took out a bottle from within his clothes. Stroking it carefully he said: \u201cBecause of this!\u201d(TL: I love how these people can put literally anything in their clothes. I want clothes like that, no more bags! ED: Ye, instead you would have to wear extremely baggy clothes with many pockets. Your call.)Xia Ning Chang was extremely confused as she lowered head to look closer at the object and she saw that it was a small bottle of Sky Tower\u2019s external injury balm, Blood Clotting Cream.The events that had occurred two months earlier flashed through her mind, causing her to cover her mouth in surprise. Foolishly, she stared at Kai Yang, because she never thought that he would keep this little bottle of Blood Clotting Cream.Chuckling lightly, Kai Yang spoke: \u201cThose who treat me well, I, Kai Yang can still tell. It has been three years since I entered, and this bottle of Blood Clotting Cream was the first token of warmth I have experienced this whole time.\u201d\u201cHow did you know\u2026\u2026\u201d Xia Ning Chang looked at him in disbelief. This bottle of cream was left for Kai Yang by her, but wasn\u2019t he unconscious at the time?Kai Yang\u2019s eyebrows lifted up a bit: \u201cThere is a saying, smelling the scent of a woman tells all.\u201dThis caused her face to be painted red, for the words were slightly lecherous sounding.But her heart and mind loosened, it seemed that just from a small bottle of Blood Clotting Cream that cost only ten contribution points, was the reason why he had agreed unconditionally. It seemed that master was wrong.\u201cIt\u2019s your turn to ask now.\u201d Since she had cleared the doubts in her heart, Xia Ning Chang would feel embarrassed if she continued to ask further thus she hurriedly went to change the subject.Kai Yang then carefully put the bottle back in his clothes and then asked: \u201cThe reason why Treasurer Meng didn\u2019t come wasn\u2019t really because of an old illness right?\u201dXia Ning Chang momentarily became embarrassed and replied after some time: \u201cI used medicine to knock him unconscious.\u201dStunned, Kai Yang suddenly erupted into a fit of laughter, and no matter what, he couldn\u2019t stop.\u201cWhat are you laughing about.\u201d She was both angry and ashamed, \u201cThat night he suddenly said I no longer needed to come, and in desperation I knocked him unconscious.\u201dKai Yang continued to laughed, so Xia Ning Chang hit him a few times. It was only afterwards, she realised how intimate her actions were, and was left at a loss on what to do.\u201cI\u2019m going to rest now. You continue to laugh to yourself.\u201d Xia Ning Chang couldn\u2019t bare to continue to stay there. Wrapping herself up, she jumped to the nearby branch and no longer paid any attention to Kai Yang.p.s. An apology to all readers for the hiatus these past weeks, month really.

    "Chapter 88": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Martial PeakChapter 89 \u2013 Mysterious Crimson Yang FlowerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 89 \u2013 Mysterious Crimson Yang FlowerTranslator \u2013 LuffyEditor \u2013 Ben &amp; ErzaAfter walking through the Black Wind forest for several days, Kai Yang realised, to his surprise that, they hadn\u2019t encountered any dangerous beasts.This caused him to be filled with anxiety, because Black Wind Mountain was filled with formidable demonic beasts. Furthermore, if they happened to bump into any, due to his current cultivation, he would only be a burden for Xia Ning Chang.But Xia Ning Chang had come prepared. Kai Yang didn\u2019t know what method she used to avoid the demonic beasts in this forest, but it worked.Their route often changed from east to west, sometimes they would circle around a place, or they would circle around a bigger place. But it was thanks to this circling that they had remained so safe. Occasionally they would bump into a beast of the second or third realm, however they would be quickly dealt with by Ning Chang with minimal effort.After carefully observing her for some time, Kai Yang discovered that Xia Ning Chang was able to discover existence of formidable demonic beasts thanks to the deep colored bracelet on her wrist.Whenever this little senior sister felt a high level demonic beast obstructing their path, she activated her bracelet which then sent out a deep green ray.This was a bracelet she hadn\u2019t been wearing previously. From top to bottom her only accessory was the sapphire on her forehead. So this bracelet should have been prepared specially for their current expedition.This was surely a rare treasure! Kai Yang\u2019s eye fell on the bracelet and from what he could see it looked like it was given to her by Treasurer Meng.Ultimately what was the background of old man Meng? Kai Yang was truly puzzled, he was merely a Contribution Hall treasurer, yet he was able to get Xia Ning Chang, with her special physique, as a disciple. Moreover, he has a rare treasure he can afford to give to her. This bracelet, if in a normal place, would be placed under the highest security and would not be carelessly given to anyone. Although he didn\u2019t know its grade, he estimated that it should at least be an earth grade rare treasure. A treasure of this rank was rarely seen in Sky Tower.While Kai Yang and Xia Ning Chang were able to pass through easily, the people tagging behind suffered many bloody battles to the death.During the past several days, small and large battles occurred several times. If it was not for the overall level of the Blood Group being so high, they probably would have become demonic beast food by now.Although Wen Fei Chen was a true element boundary fifth boundary powerhouse, his luck wasn\u2019t very good. Just that moment their group bumped into a peak fifth realm demonic beast, equivalent to a peak true element boundary powerhouse; several levels above his present strength.An incomparably difficult fight ensued. Through taking advantage of their numbers, they were able to deal with it. However due to this battle, the Blood Group lost a master of the separation and reunion boundary. This caused Wen Fei Chen to become extremely angry because a total of eight people had come, but he was the only true element boundary master. The separation and reunion boundary group only had four people remaining, and rest were only at the qi transforming stage mid level. Long Hui\u2019s strength was the weakest of all, at the lower levels of the Qi transforming stage.Originally they thought that as long as they followed Kai Yang and Xia Ning Chang\u2019s trail, they wouldn\u2019t encounter any big dangers. But god only knows how those two were able to avoid these demonic beasts, while they, their followers, encountered battle after battle.And now, they had lost a separation and reunion boundary master. Why wouldn\u2019t Wen Fei Chen get angry?But it wasn\u2019t the time to back down; not after losing so many people, how could they give up halfway? After taking a short break, Wen Fei Chen said to Nu Lang: \u201cGo in front, we must get going!\u201dNu Lang looked on the ground at an abandoned limb absent mindedly. Earlier, the Blood Group had lost some people, so how could their lowly Storm House disciples stay safe?Two disciples from Storm House were swallowed into the belly of a fifth realm demonic beast, leaving only half an arm left on ground.He finally understood why he had felt something was not right that night, where were the good intentions of the Blood Group to help them look for Kai Yang? It just was to make the people from Storm House the pathfinders along the way!But even if he understood in his heart, he wouldn\u2019t dare to complain, not to mention revolt. Forging the way at the front, perhaps they could also have a chance to live. But if they revolted at this time, then there is only death awaiting them.With a pale complexion Nu Lang made a disciple from Storm House walk in front. Behind him, Wen Fei Chen gave instructions; heading from the east towards the west, from time to time they also lost Kai Yang\u2019s trail.At this moment, Kai Yang, who was hurrying along with Xia Ning Chang, suddenly stopped in his step. Turning his head to look towards a direction, his eyes glittered with a joyful look.\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d Xia Ning Chang turned her head to ask, while stopping.\u201cIs there any danger over there?\u201d Kai Yang asked pointing to one side.\u201cDoesn\u2019t have any danger, I haven\u2019t felt any trace of a demonic beast. Xia Ning Chang lowered her head to look at own bracelet.\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d Kai Yang moved rashly. Although Xia Ning Chang doesn\u2019t know why he was so happy, so can only follow.Although Xia Ning Chang was at a loss as to why Kai Yang was so happy, she still followed him.Walking for a short distance of only a few tens of feet, Xia Ning Chang suddenly felt steam on her skin. This caused her face to become red. Looking around the ground was yang type Qi and the ground was unexpectedly covered with a variety of palm sized, big, red flowers.The quantity of flowers was not small, there were at least a dozen of them.Kai Yang was unceremoniously quickly picking up these flowers, in total he picked eleven of these flowers.After a short time, Kai Yang had reaped a great harvest and was walking happily, he asked, \u201cWhat do you think these are?\u201d\u201cMysterious Crimson Yang Flower, Earth grade low level material. So you came here for these things.\u201d Xia Ning Chang was suddenly enlightened.\u201cEarth grade lower level material!\u201d Kai Yang\u2019s brows creased together, \u201cNot bad.\u201dHe could feel the Yang energy contained in each Mysterious Crimson Yang Flower was not inferior to the Three Sun Fruit. A moment ago the Yang Energy contained in his chest had reacted; he arrived at this place to look at what had caused it and in turn reaped a bountiful harvest.Since they were in the Black Wind Mountain\u2019s inner region, the valuables around should be few in number. But this time the goal was to help Xia Ning Chang, even if he had thoughts of searching all directions he couldn\u2019t do it.Delaying time like this would be taking a major risk.But since it was in vicinity of his senses, naturally it can\u2019t be left alone.\u201cWant me to help you refine them?\u201d Xia Ning Chang asked.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to right now. Let\u2019s wait until evening, at that time we can refine them.\u201dThe refining method for a pill of immortality from little senior sister is superb, but refining will always consume world Qi. Walking in this dense forest Kai Yang is still thinking to be careful every step of the way, if consumption of world Qi can be avoided then it should be avoided.\u201cSounds good.\u201d Xia Ning Chang nodded, \u201cWe are not far from that place, after walking for two-three more days we can reach our destination, we have got enough time.\u201dKai Yang did not know whether it was luck or something else, walking for one day he was able to find several yang energy treasures at a distance of only one days walk from the Mysterious Crimson Yang Flowers.But this time his luck was not so good, these Yang energy herbal medicines, had a level three demonic beast protecting them.Xia Ning Chang was able to deal with that demonic beast by exhausting some of her World Qi, so that Kai Yang could harvest them. After passing through the forest, they arrived at a giant mountain valley. Xia Ning Chang said in one long breath: \u201cJunior brother, we have arrived.\u201dp.s. Yay, another chapter is out. Hope you had happy reading.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Furthermore, the valley was perfectly circular.From where Kai Yang was standing, when he lowered his head to look down he discovered that the depth of valley from their current position was about three hundred feet. The valley below was green and lush, there was nothing to distinguish it from the outside jungle, the scenery in the valley was very beautiful.Verdant hills and limpid waters, the landscape wasn\u2019t bad.Xia Ning Chang looked down at her bracelet carefully. After some time, she jumped joyfully: \u201cOur luck is very good. There aren\u2019t any formidable demonic beasts down there.\u201dWhile she spoke, she couldn\u2019t help but start to relax, because on the way here she was able to avoid high levelled demonic beasts blocking their path. But if there were dangerous demonic beasts in the valley, they could only fight them. After all, their destination was precisely this place.\u201cIt looks very ordinary.\u201d Kai Yang said frowning.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s just not time yet.\u201d Xia Ning Chang showed a faint smile: \u201cIf not for passing through this place accidentally with master, then perhaps we wouldn\u2019t be able to discover this mysterious place. It was also at that time, that master conceived the idea of refining the Nine Yin Dew Crystals.\u201d\u201cBut why did he go back at such a critical time? Also, you haven\u2019t told me how I am going to help you obtain them.\u201dFor the past few days they had been rushing the journey, and Kai Yang was not eager to know the reason why. Now that they had arrived at the destination, he could not help but ask, what if when the time comes, when the Nine Yin Dew Crystals actually appear, he didn\u2019t know how to capture them, wouldn\u2019t he being ruining important plans.Therefore some preparation needed to be made before hand.\u201cWhen the time comes I will tell you.\u201d Xia Ning Chang still didn\u2019t explain.Kai Yang was still doubtful but did not continue to ask. Afterall this matter was quite mysterious. Treasurer Meng\u2019s temper before was still causing Kai Yang some confusion. But since he had promised to help them, he would have to help them with everything he\u2019s got when the time comes.\u201cCome.\u201d Xia Ning Chang beckoned to Kai Yang.Kai Yang looked at her curiously, \u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to carry you down.\u201d Xia Ning Chang replied while blinking her big eyes, \u201cWe are at quite a high altitude.\u201d\u201cI can go myself.\u201d said Kai Yang while refusing her offer. In a joking manner, he said, \u201cI am a man how can I let a woman carry me down. What would it look like?\u201dAfter saying that he proceeded to jump down, Xia Ning Chang screamed, as Kai Yang was falling like a meteorite towards the ground , scattering leaves and plants everywhere.Xia Ning Chang was quite frightened, Kai Yang\u2019s strength was not that high after all, but after jumping from such a height would he be able to live to see tomorrow? At that moment she followed him down, preparing to help him at the critical moment.The speed of their fall was increasing steadily, and when they were seven feet from ground Kai Yang\u2019s legs struck the mountain wall and rebounded him off the wall, Kai Yang did several somersaults, gradually breaking the speed of his fall before finally landing with a big bang. Kai Yang\u2019s legs formed a curved pit in the ground with dust flying upwards.Xia Ning Chang then fells gently at his side. Between the two of them, one was like a fairy returning to earth and the other was like a human rock falling to the ground, there were no similarities between them. No matter what, they still kept calm and steady after the jump.Kai Yang\u2019s skin had some scratches and there were some twigs on his clothes, and both of his legs were slightly trembling.Xia Ning Chang pursed her lips, while suppressing a smile. With her ability to judge, she could just see it. But her good junior brother had already suffered some losses.Thirty feet ah. With his initial element third stage strength, jumping down with just this strength, even with an extra jump, it would be considered a miracle if he landed on the ground safely.Xia Ning Chang pretended to look around and then said, \u201cToday is the fifth day and after two days it will be the seventh, I\u2019m going to need to arrange something in this mountain valley. Junior brother wait for me here, since there is no danger in this area anyways..\u201dKai Yang\u2019s expression was solemn as he silently nodded in response.Xia Ning Chang started walking, but after taking a few steps she turned around again to reassure him and said, \u201cThe arrangement will take quite some time so do not run all over the place, otherwise I may not be able to find you.\u201dKai Yang nodded his head once again slightly, looking grim; as his handsome face was slowly turning sour.Waiting for Xia Ning Chang\u2019s shadow to disappear from his line of sight, Kai Yang finally sat on the ground, rubbing his painful and sore legs with his two hands.Although he was able to reduce the speed of his fall while he was falling, the fall was still quite painful.After quite a while, the numbness in his legs faded away, Kai Yang didn\u2019t stay still for long, and he started searching around. Although Xia Ning Chang had told him this place was safe it was always good to be careful.After checking the mountain valley, he wasn\u2019t able to discover any dangers nearby.Kai Yang had to wait until the afternoon of the following day before Xia Ning Chang finally returned back to the mountain valley.Even though he didn\u2019t know what she had arranged around the valley, he was able to tell that this arrangement had consumed quite a bit of her world Qi, judging by her pale complexion.\u201cI am going to go rest first, tonight between 11pm and 1am the Nine Yin Dew Crystals will gather together and open, they will remain open until sunrise. We must find the Nine Yin Dew Crystals, then obtain them, if we are unable to succeed within that time, they will go into hiding once more.\u201d Xia Ning Chang said anxiously, before putting several grains of compounding drugs in her mouth and forcing herself to close her mouth.She then sat down to meditate.Kai Yang stood next to her, protecting her while following the Buddhist law, motionless like a sculpture.Somewhere nearby the mountain valley, several miles away, them members of the Blood Group and Storm House were distressed.Following Kai Yang and Xia Ning Chang they penetrated the interior of Black Wind mountain, but they suffered a great loss doing so.There were originally 17 people, and now only 13 people remained, the others had lost their lives due to the constant demonic beast attacks.In the Blood Group they still had seven people left; but they had once again lost a separation and reunion boundary master. Now there were only three separation and reunion boundary masters remaining. Many of them had wounds on their bodies, Wei Fei Chen\u2019s chest had bloodstains, the two remaining qi transforming stage disciples were utterly exhausted.In the Storm House group there were only six people remaining, apart for Nu Lang who was in the qi transforming first stage, there were four disciples at the initial element stage. The final member, his luck was too good, the only blow he had received was to his head, leaving him mentally disabled.Out of the all the people present the only one still in perfect condition was Long Hui.His status was special, even during the most difficult fights he was protected and kept on the inside, thus naturally he was impossible to kill or injure.After pursuing Kai Yang for several days, Long Hui had finally lost his patience, \u201cHallmaster Wen, do we still need to pursue? Pursuing further will only lead to more losses, and when the time comes for Grandfather to investigate, who will take responsibility for this?\u201dWen Fei Chen was thoroughly angered that Long Hui wanted him to carry this burden. If not because I wanted to please you, I wouldn\u2019t have made such a decision and if I had known earlier that this trip was going to be this dangerous would I have had the guts to follow? If so, I would have already killed Kai Yang in that small village.Although in his heart he was thinking this, Wen Fei Chen only said, \u201cThere is no need to pursue any further, evidently they have already arrived at their destination, it seems that the mountain valley ahead was their goal.\u201dp.s.

You said the thing that they\u2019re looking for is just up ahead?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. They should have arrived there yesterday. But even after such a long time, they still haven\u2019t moved, so I it\u2019s likely that they reached their destination.\u201d Wen Fei Chen smirked.\u201cThen what are we still waiting for? Didn\u2019t we chase them all the way here, for this moment?\u201d Long Hui\u2019s heart **. Obtaining treasures, all these were secondary. All he wanted right now was to see Xia Ning Chang\u2019s true appearance. He had held it in for so many days already, how could he still hold it?Wen Fei Chen only smiled: \u201cAlthough they have arrived at their destination, it seems that they have yet to find what they are looking for. Young master Long, please bear it for a bit longer. This Wen promises that the female won\u2019t fly away.\u201dLong Hui was somewhat impatient, because previously Wen Fei Chen had said those same words in the the small village. And during their journey here, they had suffered great losses, so naturally he was unwilling to keep waiting.But he couldn\u2019t express his emotion plainly, so after thinking about it for awhile, he could only say: \u201cThen we shall wait two more days. Two days later, if they haven\u2019t made a move, then we shall!\u201dWen Fei Chen nodded his head helplessly and sighed internally. Someone useless like Long Hui, who only had women in his mind, in the future, he would only be a useless person.It was late in the night before Xia Ning Chang finally opened her eyes, the previous battered look was gone from her eyes; it was clear that she was fully recovered.Saying a quick thanks, she and Kai Yang took out some provisions to eat.\u201cSoon it will be the Zi hour (11pm-1am) and this mountain valley will be filled with Yin energy. Junior brother, your cultivation is far from mine, and the amount of World Qi you possess is limited and should not be squandered.\u201d Xia Ning Chang warmly, but seriously reminded him.\u201cEn.\u201d Kai Yang nodded his head in understanding. Although he possessed ten or so drops of Yang Liquid in his dantian, and needn\u2019t worry about the energy problems, but he wouldn\u2019t say that out loud.Just as the two were talking, something suddenly changed within the mountain valley.According to logic, in this type of mountain valley with high cliffs on all four sides, there shouldn\u2019t be any wind. But currently, ill, howling wind had begun to blow within the valley, like a woman weeping at night, chilling the heart.Following the ill wind, cold air rose up from the ground, forcibly activating Kai Yang\u2019s True Yang tactics.This cold air wasn\u2019t like the winter\u2019s chill, rather it was more like the chill brought by a ghost or malicious creature, freezing one all the way to their core.The speed at which the True Yang Tactics worked, had to increase yet again before Kai Yang could disperse the chill within his heart.\u201cJunior brother!\u201d Xia Ning Chang called out and pulled Kai Yang to her side, quickly taking out a purple jade pendant.As soon as Kai Yang came closer to Xia Ning Chang, he felt the coldness disappear and become replaced by a warmth that filled his entire body.\u201cStay close to me and don\u2019t stray too far. This jade pendant can counter the cold from the Yin energy. \u201dHis eyes widening in astonishment, Kai Yang looked over at the purple coloured jade pendant in Xia Ning Chang\u2019s hand. Looking at it, he saw that it was a secret artifact, and due to her injection of World Qi, it emitted a glow, dispersing the surrounding Yin energy.Kai Yang was shocked. This senior sister\u2019s wrist held a secret artifact, and now the jade pendant she took out was another secret artifact. How many of these did she have?\u201cWhy are you staring at me?\u201d Xia Ning Chang\u2019s face turned red and her voice as soft as a mozzie.Staring blankly, Kai Yang took a moment to realise that what he was doing was a bit inappropriate.Because the area of protection from this jade pendant wasn\u2019t too large, when the two people stood together, their bodies were basically sticking together. His own shoulder and arm, could clearly feel her body temperature, her body\u2019s softness and he could smell her unique scent.This situation was definitely the same for Xia Ning Chang.This intimate situation was somewhat difficult for her to bear, even her eyes showed signs of her shyness and had gathered a layer of liquid. And her neck was just as red as her face.\u201cYou World Qi is very precious, so you mustn\u2019t use it here. You can only use it to subdue the Nine Yin Dew Crystals later.\u201d With nothing to say, Xia Ning Chang forced out something to say, to keep her attention away from their current situation and from Kai Yang\u2019s body temperature. But the more she tried to avoid thinking about it, the more she thought about.\u201cThis is only the beginning of this period. Later on, this entire mountain valley will be completely covered in dense Yin energy. Junior brother, you definitely mustn\u2019t leave my side, or the results will be unimaginable.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Kai Yang nodded his head lightly.The two people no longer said anything. In such a position, with their bodies sticking together at such close proximity, they quietly waited.A beating heart.So frantic, it tingled.Xia Ning Chang\u2019s body began to heat up more and more. This was the first time in her life that she felt as if thorns were stinging her heart, and her entire body itched. Even if she wanted to move, she couldn\u2019t. It was at the point, where she had started to tremble.Kai Yang also felt her embarrassment. Seeing her blood red skin, he knitted his eyebrows together and said: \u201cHow about, I go outside?\u201dHe still held some confidence that he would be able to block the surrounding Yin energy himself, because his True Yang tactics was the nemesis of Yin energy. Even if it did expend energy, it wouldn\u2019t use a lot of energy. For this little senior sister was too innocent. Seeing her this uncomfortable, Kai Yang also felt bad.\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Xia Ning Chang quickly shook her head, \u201cJust\u2026.stand by my side. Definitely don\u2019t leave.\u201dBecause she was this adamant, Kai Yang was left at a loss.On the other side, the Blood Group\u2019s group had already sensed the changes occurring in the valley and all rushed over.Looking down at the Yin energy below, Wen Fei Chen probed about and pondered.Long Hui\u2019s spirits were rising: \u201cHallmaster Wen, have they started to act already?\u201dAs long at Kai Yang and Xia Ning Chang moved, then his group would be able to charge down without any hesitation.He didn\u2019t reply immediately and instead continued to looked around. There definitely was something strange happening down below, but even with all of Wen Fei Chen\u2019s experience and knowledge, he still wasn\u2019t sure what it was. Seeing Long Hui\u2019s impatience, he grudgingly said: \u201cWhether they moved or not, it is still unclear. But certainly, there should be some mysterious object down there. How about we\u2026\u2026..\u201dBefore Wen Fei Chen could finish his words, he was impatiently cut off by Long Hui: \u201cDon\u2019t wait anymore. Since the object has decided to show itself, whether or not they make a move is no longer important. Hallmaster Wen, how about we go deal with them now? Afterwards, it still wouldn\u2019t be too late to retrieve that treasure.\u201dSighing, Wen Fei Chen could only nod his head: \u201cOkay then. You all, go!\u201dIn the night\u2019s darkness, a sinister light flashed through Long Hui\u2019s eyes. Later on he would be able to capture that masked female and take her cover away to reveal her full glory, then pin her beneath himself to enjoy her bliss, Long Hui couldn\u2019t suppress the excitement he felt just thinking of it.Kai Yang ah, Kai Yang. Since you dare to have ideas about my woman, then you shall suffer the consequences that await you.Later, I won\u2019t kill you. I\u2019ll personally let you witness how I will sully that woman. Making her scream out miserably, I will then relish your anger and powerlessness.Thirteen people, no longer concealing their tracks, under Wen Fei Chen\u2019s directions, sprinted and jumped down into the mountain valley.That tempered body staged Storm House disciple was the most pitiful. With such a large height, he didn't dare to jump down. But he waited only to be mercilessly kicked down by Long Hui and directly fell to his death.An angry wave, doesn\u2019t wait for people. The falling disciple felt extremely humiliated.p.s. Regular chapter for the week. Until next time then guys~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 91": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Martial PeakChapter 92 \u2013 ConfrontationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 92 \u2013 ConfrontationTranslator \u2013 LuffyEditor \u2013 Ben &amp; ErzaPeople from the Blood Group and Storm House were making too much of a ruckus. And even before landing, the tempered body disciple had died with a pitiful yell. Due to the outburst of Yin energy, his yell traveled far and wide.Listening to this Kai Yang and Xia Ning Chang\u2019s faces both changed colours. They turned their heads to look in the direction from where the yell had originated.They hadn\u2019t known that they were being tracked by enemies. Wen Fei Chen\u2019s tracking method was quite good, and the distance at which he tracked them from was also quite a good distance, so the danger of being discovered was also close to none. Although Xia Ning Chang was at the peak of the separation and reunion boundary, she still wasn\u2019t able to sense things happening too far away from herself. By doing some mental arithmetic regarding the tracking distance, Wen Fei Chen was able to successfully tail them.\u201cHow come there are other people here?\u201d Xia Ning Chang furrowed her delicate eyebrows, something wasn\u2019t right.Kai Yang\u2019s expression also turned cold. According to his little senior sister, this place was ordinary throughout the year and only on the seventh of July, did this change take place. This couldn\u2019t have come to attention of anyone.In other words, those people who were not that far away, came for exact same thing as them, either they knew about this change or they were here for them.The possibility of latter was enormous, and it looked like they had quite a large number of people on their side. But thankfully, some of them died while jumping down the cliff.If these people came to Black Wind Mountain to seek medicine or to hunt demonic beasts, they wouldn\u2019t bring people with such low levels of cultivation and they wouldn\u2019t move in such large groups. \u201cLooks like we have got trouble.\u201d With many thoughts racing through his mind Kai Yang, suggested: \u201cLet\u2019s flee first.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Xia Ning Chang nodded in agreement.\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d A cold voice transmitted from behind them. Then, suddenly a silhouette appeared a few feet in front of the two people, impeding their path.Kai Yang and Xia Ning Chang were startled by the sudden appearance of the powerhouse. Simultaneously, they dodged the palm, while vigilantly revolving their World Qi.Before the person revealed their real intentions, Kai Yang didn\u2019t plan to confront them head on.Wen Fei Chen arrived there to block Kai Yang and Xia Ning Chang. Seeing them knowing their place, he didn\u2019t launch another attack, but instead calmly stood in same place.Kai Yang didn\u2019t enter his eyes, but when he saw Xia Ning Chang wearing the veil, Wen Fei Chang admired the beautiful pure girl in his heart. Although he couldn\u2019t see her facial features, with those eyes clear like stars her looks couldn\u2019t be common. More so, the figure of this girl was also outstanding.Looking at the eyes of this sexually attractive girl, Wen Fei Chen thoughts filled with a feeling of palpitating eagerness. But if it was Long Hui standing here instead of him, he was afraid of what shameful things he would do.All three were looking at each other vigilantly. Kai Yang looked for an escape route, but discovered that all means of escape were blocked by the qi of the middle aged man; just by standing there, he blocked all of their escape routes.\u201cThis person is a true element boundary powerhouse, so junior brother don\u2019t act rashly.\u201d Xia Ning Chang warned him in a soft voice.True element boundary! Kai Yang\u2019s breath\u2019s slowed, his heart became more alert.After some time, the other people from Blood Group and Storm House caught up, and they were all looking at Kai Yang and Xia Ning Chang with bad intentions.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Kai Yang furrowed his brows sizing them up, but discovered that he didn\u2019t know anyone in this group, in his heart he was very suspicious.He actually didn\u2019t know that originally in this group there were many people with whom he was quite familiar. But because their strengths were low, they were eaten by demonic beasts on road and the last remaining one had plunged to his death while jumping down the cliff earlier.\u201cI am a person who wants to send you to your death.\u201d Long Hui came from behind Wen Fei Chen, smiling coldly. When saw Xia Ning Chang his eyes immediately emitted green light, looking at her with lewd eyes, he said, \u201cWonderful, wonderful! What a beautiful pure girl, this time really was worth it!\u201dXia Ning Chang furrowed her delicate eyebrows, her face revealing her loathing of him, she hid quietly behind Kai Yang. Although her strength was higher than Kai Yang\u2019s by many times, she was very innocent, so hiding behind Kai Yang didn\u2019t have any meaning but rather it was the instinct of a woman.Since she was so close to Kai Yang, he could feel two soft delicate bumps on his back, and couldn\u2019t help but swallow while straightening his back.Under this crisis, Kai Yang\u2019s state of mind was steady, without any ripples, hesitating he asked, \u201cGentlemen do we have grudges between us?\u201dNow Kai Yang knew that the opposite party hadn\u2019t come here by chance, this was absolutely a deliberate trap. Otherwise when meeting for first time how can they be hostile.Are these enemies of Treasurer Meng and his disciple? All kinds of scenarios were playing out in Kai Yang\u2019s mind, even though he can only die at least he will know the reason why.\u201cNaturally there are grudges.\u201d Long Hui knew victory was in his hands, so he didn\u2019t want to hide his status, \u201cBoy, let me tell you, I am Blood Group Vice Guild Master Long Zai Tian\u2019s Grandson, you dare to have ideas about Hui Mei Er, and did you ever think that because of it you would be in such a pinch today?\u201dKai Yang was stunned, he hadn\u2019t thought this time people were looking for trouble with him about this kind of thing. He had only met Hui Mei Er three times and their friendship was not too close yet it led to the jealousy of someone considering him a love rival, Kai Yang could only sighs in his heart as he was left speechless.However Kai Yang hadn\u2019t forgotten the Long Zai Tian who was mentioned, previously he had run into that old man in mining area of the Blood Group. The humiliation left behind during that encounter, he can never forget.Hearing Long Hui, Nu Lang also said gloomily, \u201cNu Tao is my younger brother. He and Chen Shao Feng together have disappeared without a trace, boy I wanted to ask you if their disappearance have any relation to you.\u201dTurns out these two groups were looking for him. Kai Yang then immediately figured out everything that was going on.Sighing darkly, the first time he left the sect, he was actually followed by two groups of enemies, and they also brought along such a powerhouse.This time he had also involved Xia Ning Chang.Taking a deep breath Kai Yang revealed a fearless face, he also lightly looked at Xia Ning Chang, his hands gently squashed Xia Ning Chang\u2019s hand, then he said in a low voice, \u201cIt is my mess, you don\u2019t need to get involved, find an opportunity to run away.\u201dSince this is his mess, he can\u2019t let Xia Ning Chang endure hardship, her running away would also reduce the burden in his heart.Although Kai Yang\u2019s voice is very light it was still heard by the opposite party.Long Hui laughed, \u201cRunning away? Do you think it will be easy, this young master was following you in the mountain forest for many days, how can he let you leave without paying you back. Kai Yang you will die today without a doubt, as for her, after your death this little bitch, will become my toy. Relax I will not kill her immediately, but will play with her until she dies.\u201dKai Yang\u2019s face turned cold, he shouted angrily, \u201cRun.\u201dSimultaneously his hands goes around and grasped Xia Ning Chang\u2019s arm, under her astonished gaze he exhausted all of his strength to send her flying to safety.\u201cWishful thinking.\u201d Wen Fei Chen smiled coldly before disappearing. Suddenly a palm attacked Xia Ning Chang\u2019s back.p.s. Surprised? Double release. \ud83d\ude00 Sponsored chapter. Please thank Travis H. and Thierry D. for they contribution.

Although Kai Yang had caught her off guard and she had been swept away by his powerful strike, she swiftly turned around to borrow the momentum from Wen Fei Chen\u2019s strike. By borrowing its power, she lightly fell beside Kai Yang.\u201cHey!\u201d Watching this occur, Kai Yang sighed inwardly. Having a true element boundary powerhouse assume command, was equal to having well trained soldiers and sturdy horses. Even if there had been hope they might make it out of this situation earlier, it looked like they were really doomed now.\u201cLord Wen, bring this female to me. If she dares to revolt again\u2026.\u201d Long Hui smiled sinisterly, before continuing coldly, \u201cBreak both her arms and legs; just don\u2019t damage her face too badly. I must have a look at what kind of peerless beauty is hiding under that veil!\u201dWen Fei Chen gently smiled: \u201cMaster Long please be at ease, I will not let her flee.\u201dHe was also a little worried that if during the course of the fight he accidentally harmed Xia Ning Chang, Long Hui would blame him. But since he had said that he can break her arms and legs, what did Wen Fei Chen have to worry about?The young master Long had very high ambitions, but he also knew his limits. He knew that he couldn\u2019t match this female, but if he could disable her arms and legs, then she wouldn\u2019t be able to rebel; this act may also cause her to act in a self-serving manner in an attempt to preserve her life.When their dialog was heard by Kai Yang and Xia Ning Chang, their eyes revealed loathing.Wen Fei Chen said in a clear voice: \u201cLittle girl, you also heard Master Long\u2019s words, if you are sensible, then obediently lie down and I promise not to hurt you. But if you insist on resisting, I will not stay my hand.\u201dXia Ning Chang spat out: \u201cNo way!\u201d\u201cOk then!\u201d Wen Fei Chen smiled coldly, \u201cYou brought this upon yourself.\u201dHis voice fading, his body soared like a swallow and both of his palms erupted with the strength of a true element boundary powerhouse. Just listening to the sound, it was like hearing a echoing tiger\u2019s roar. Suddenly the attack split into many smaller attacks and flew towards Xia Ning Chang.Feeling the might of attack, Xia Ning Chang also turned serious. Both her white hands flew out like they were dancing, while Qi condensed around her index finger, touching the sapphire on her forehead, causing violent waves of Qi to erupt from it.Although the power contained in the attacks originating from her sapphire was not small, they couldn\u2019t prevent much of the incoming attack.In the next instance, the attack arrived in front of Xia Ning Chang.This all happened so fast, there was no time for Kai Yang to react.The several attacks flew towards her, one after another. Those attacks severely wounded her, before suddenly the sapphire on her forehead emitted a mysterious and profound ripple, which was followed by a semi circular light, completely covering her and Kai Yang.When Wen Fei Chen\u2019s strike came in contact with the light curtain, it just dissolved away.Xia Ning Chang stood there motionlessly with a frosty expression.Wen Fei Chen dropped to the ground, his eyes staring at the light curtain with a shocked expression. His voice cracking he said: \u201cHeaven Grade treasure!\u201dHearing these words, everyone\u2019s eyes became red, including the eyes of Long Hui; containing nothing but lust.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Long Hui finally diverted his attention from Xia Ning Chang and looked at Wen Fei Chen. His voice slightly shaking, he asked: \u201cLord Wen, what did you say a moment ago?\u201dWen Fei Chen\u2019s cheeks trembled, his eyes contained a faint trace of greed. Swallowing a mouthful of saliva he said, \u201cHeaven grade treasure, to resist my attack so easily, this is a heaven grade treasure without a doubt.\u201d\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Long Hui was excited beyond belief. He hadn\u2019t thought that this time while eradicating this pipsqueak Kai Yang; who was nothing more than a bug; not only would he obtain a beautiful woman, but he would also gain a heaven grade treasure.Heaven grade treasures are priceless items, in the Blood Group only Hu Man was in possession of one of these.If this heaven grade treasure were to land in his grandfather\u2019s lap, it could increase his strength by another level; perhaps even Hu Man would no longer be his match.\u201cSeize, we must seize it.\u201d Long Hui shouted excitedly,\u201dLord Wen if you can snatch this, in the future the Vice Guild Master\u2019s position will belong to you.\u201dHearing this Wen Fei Chen looked inspired: \u201cMany thanks for young master Long\u2019s care.\u201dAlthough he said that, he knew that breaking the defense of that heaven grade treasure wouldn\u2019t be easy. Given how his earlier strike had no effect, he knew that this bone would be very hard to gnaw. However, luck was on their side, with this small girl\u2019s strength she would be unable to protect both herself and Kai Yang for an extended period of time. So if he attacked unceasingly, there was a chance of breaking this light curtain.\u201cBegin!\u201d With this thought, Wen Fei Chen started to hit the light curtain. At the same time other masters from the Blood Group also stepped forward to fiercely display their skills.Under these numerous strikes many ripples were created on the light curtain. But, by the light curtain\u2019s protection Xia Ning Chang and Kai Yang remained unharmed, meanwhile all the attacks were completely dissipated.This situation allowed Kai Yang a little hope for escape; both his eyes glittered with this hope. His thoughts were flying rapidly in his head, trying to find a way out before the light curtain disappeared.\u201cJunior brother, are you afraid?\u201d Xia Ning Chang asked suddenly.\u201cEh?\u201d Kai Yang turned his head to look at her.\u201cWe could die, are you afraid?\u201d\u201cAfraid of what, you do not need to be afraid.\u201d Kai Yang said, then he looked to the side where Long Hui was. Thinking coldly that if he could seize that person, then everything would be solved.But wanting to break through the blockade of these powerhouses from the Blood Group who were protecting Long Hui wouldn\u2019t be easy. Perhaps even Xia Ning Chang, with her strength, would be unable to achieve it.\u201cI\u2019m not afraid!\u201d Xia Ning Chang smiled gently: \u201cThey do not know the consequences of their actions.\u201dKai Yang was startled. Attempting to decipher her words, he suddenly felt that the mountain valley had become discoloured.Midnight!On July seventh, Yin Qi would gather! The place where these Nine Yin Dew Crystals gather suddenly emitted a cold and gloomy Yin Qi one after another from within the ground. This Yin Qi formed a strange, big hand on surface of earth. It kept on growing bigger, whoever looked at it would be frightened.In the blink of an eye, the temperature in the mountain valley fell drastically, the bone seeping cold made everyone tremble.The powerhouses from the Blood Group suddenly realised that, their World Qi was being sucked away by the Yin Qi in the atmosphere.Although this Yin Qi was making these people uncomfortable, it was not life threatening; as long as they could still circulate their World Qi it didn\u2019t pose a big problem. However, the disciples from Storm House, whose cultivations were low, wouldn\u2019t be able to resist this Yin Qi for a long time. If they stayed here for a long time their World Qi would be exhausted and they would freeze to death.In an instant the entire mountain valley was buried in Yin Qi. Xia Ning Chang suddenly moved, her appearance was graceful, like she was dancing. With unknown hand signs, her World Qi was divided into many parts and dispersed.p.s. Regular of the week, hoped you enjoyed it and let's what these Nine Yin Dew Crystals look like.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If one were to look down at the valley, the scene would be quite similar to that of a pot of boiling water; it was like the Yin Qi was alive, repeatedly rolling around and around, intimidating to the extreme.\u201cNot good!\u201d Wen Fei Chen shouted. Although he wasn\u2019t too sure what Xia Ning Chang was doing, but as a powerhouse of the true element fifth boundary, he could more or less understand that it wouldn\u2019t be good for them.This female probably set up some sort of formation within this valley earlier and was rushing to activate it now.If she truly activated this formation, then this situation might be turned around.\u201cPut some effort in! Quickly help me break this light screen!\u201d Wen Fei Chen bellowed out. He wanted to capture Xia Ning Chang before she successfully activated that mysterious formation or there would be no end to this matter.\u201cYou guys come over too, otherwise I will kill you right now!\u201d Wen Fei Chen threatened those Storm House disciples who were just standing off to the side.Nu Lang and others, how could they dare hesitate. Afterall, for a battle such as this, they knew their limits and were completely unable to contribute. This had caused them to watch from the sidelines. But once Wen Fei Chen\u2019s order came, they quickly jumped in to assist him.Although their skills were weak, if combined, it could still whittle away at the light screen\u2019s defense.The twelve people present all squeezed out all of their power, attacking the barrier with all their might.Although waves rippled across its surface making it appear like it was about to break, it still held firm.Inside the barrier, Kai Yang\u2019s heart palpitated rapidly. He wanted to help, but his cultivation was far too low to do anything. He could only stand next to Xia Ning Chang so that if the barrier fell, he could used what little strength he possessed to protect her.Xia Ning Chang\u2019s hand movements gradually became faster and faster, until after images were formed. This caused the Yin Qi to blow more fiercely and shrilly, it sounded like the howls of wolves and the wailing of ghosts, causing hearts to shudder.While Wen Fei Chen\u2019s face revealed his greed; he had underestimated the grade of the defensive artifact. It should at least be a heaven grade upper level defensive artifact, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be able to hold up for such a long period of time without breaking.Heaven grade upper level ah. This thing was able to block attacks from cultivators at the upper boundaries of the immortal ascension boundary. So if he possessed this treasure, it would be equivalent to gaining an extra life.After the time it took to burn a stick of incense, a tiny crack appeared on the light barrier.With the appearance of the crack, Xia Ning Chang\u2019s face also turned white! In order to use this defensive artifact, Xia Ning Chang had used up a good portion of her World Qi. Furthermore, in order to complete this formation that she was doing, she need to utilize waves of her World Qi further depleting her World Qi.Seeing this ray of hope, Wen Fei Chen urged the others to attack more furiously, while increasing his killing intent. Although it looked ordinary and harmless, he urged his World Qi to rise up from his body and push forwards.Throwing a powerful palm strike on the surface, the entire barrier shook, along with Xia Ning Chang\u2019s petite body. With this strike, her face became even more white.Crack, crack, crack\u2026\u2026.finally, cracks had started to streak across the barrier like a spiderweb.\u201cHa ha ha!\u201d He laughed out loudly. Wen Fei Chen had faith that as long as he let out another full powered strike, he would be able to fully breakthrough.But before he could release this final palm strike, the Yin Qi within the valley suddenly settled down. The howling and wailing that he could hear, also disappeared.Xia Ning Chang\u2019s clear and pure as star eyes glittered and she called out in her lovable voice: \u201cSeal!\u201dAt that moment, Xia Ning Chang\u2019s preparations were complete!Crash, crash\u2026\u2026.from the sky, chains suddenly appeared along with the sound of locks locking.Looking up in confusion, they could see ten foot long chains, that were coarse and black, floating in the sky. These black chains excluded a dense Yin Qi and a chill that froze the heart.These black Yin Qi chains, floated around the heads of the Blood Group and Storm House. In the next instant, as if they had a mind of their own, they flew towards the people.His face contorting, Wen Fei Chen knew that he was step too late. Hurrying, he hastily sent another palm strike towards the barrier.At the same time, Xia Ning Chang\u2019s body flashed as she once again activated her defensive artifact.But that palm strike pushed on unobstructed towards Xia Ning Chang.At that instant, the vigilant Kai Yang finally found an opportunity to move. Just as the palm was about to arrived, he quickly pulled Xia Ning Chang to the side, but he was still a bit too slow, as the palm grazed her body. When that strike grazed her, Xia Ning Chang\u2019s adorable face shivered. Without any hesitation, Kai Yang pushed her head into his chest and rapidly dashed away with her.The enemy had far too many people and their cultivations were far too high. He wasn\u2019t so stupid as to face them head on.As Kai Yang carried Xia Ning Chang away to escape, those Yin Qi chains finally trapped the experts from the Blood Group.There were eight of these chains in total. With Wen Fei Chen\u2019s special attention to Xia Ning Chang, three of these chains sped straight towards him. The remaining five chains made their way towards the separation and reunion boundary and qi transforming staged experts of the Blood Group.Those who were being captured by these chains thought their lives were going to end. But just as they thought this, the eight chains seemed to disappear into their bodies and out of sight.Wen Fei Chen immediately felt that his true element boundary cultivation had been suppressed. Releasing a groan, he then spat out a mouthful of blood.Those three experts at the separation and reunion boundary, as well as the qi transforming staged disciple were in the same predicament. Their faces had all turned quite pale and they all vomited out blood.Meanwhile the remaining qi transforming disciple directly stopped breathing and fell to the ground dead!\u201cWhat is happening?\u201d Long Hui shouted out vigorously, for he had watched all that had happened. Just as he realised the opponent possessed a heaven grade defensive artifact and was thinking about how to defile Xia Ning Chang\u2019s body, it had all changed. In an instant, someone from his side had died, while five were seriously injured; even Wen Fei Chen was in a sorry state!How could Long Hui not be angry? The duck that was at his lips, suddenly flew away!\u201cPlease calm down young master Long.\u201d Gritting his teeth against the pain, Wen Fei Chen managed to call out and began to use his World Qi to forcibly suppress and expel the chill in his body. His voice extremely weak, he began to explain: \u201cI\u2019m afraid that, that female had set up some things here before hand. Borrowing the environment, she was able to activate some mysterious skills and gain the upper hand. Due to a moment of negligence, I allowed her to succeed.\u201d\u201cTrash, a group of trash!\u201d Long Hui stamped his foot in fury, before continuing loudly: \u201cSo many people to deal with just two people and you still lost.\u201dA hint of anger appeared on Wen Fei Chen\u2019s face, but he suppressed his anger and said: \u201cAlthough we suffered a loss, that female definitely isn\u2019t in a much better condition. I\u2019m afraid that she doesn\u2019t have any more World Qi left. So if we are able to find them now, they would be pigs on the chopping board!\u201dItching to get this plan underway, Long Hui ordered: \u201cThen what are you waiting for, hurry up and chase after them!\u201dTurning his gaze towards the Storm House disciples, he commanded: \u201cI\u2019ll give you a chance to save yourselves. If you are able to capture that female and bring her back to me, then I, Wen Fei Chen promise to bring you out of here safely!\u201dJust then, Xia Ning Chang\u2019s eight chains had all targeted powerhouses from the Blood Group, so it was the Storm House\u2019s people that had suffered no major injuries. Of the five that had entered the valley, none had died and their conditions were much better than the Blood Group\u2019s.p.s. Sorry for the late release, I thought I released the chapter already. But I hope this arc will end soon because Long Hui is really starting to get on my nerves.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Despite how miserable the opposite party looked they truly don\u2019t have enough power to cope with them. At this moment Nu lang asked, \u201cMay I confirm with senior Wen, if that female really doesn\u2019t have the power to hit back?\u201d\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d Wen Fei Chen answered patiently, \u201cNow go and pursue, even you can catch her with your hands, bring her back to master Long, doing so can also bring you many advantages.\u201d\u201cOk, then we can chase.\u201d Nu Lang\u2019s eyes flashed with wisps of madness and hatred. To reach this day, he had suffered through many bloody battles, along with the disciples of Storm House, many people had died along the way and they had lost all the disciples at the tempered body stage.His anger couldn\u2019t be relieved on Wen Fei Chen, so naturally he can only shift it onto Kai Yang and Xia Ning Chang.Xia Ning Chang doesn\u2019t have any strength remaining and how can that trivial Kai Yang be placed in their eyes.When the people from Storm House disappeared into that mountain valley filled with dense Yin Qi, Wen Fei Chen looked at the remaining people from the Blood Group, \u201cYou also go, you absolutely can\u2019t let that female run away, behind her there is definitely a powerhouse supporting her, if news of today is revealed we will have huge trouble.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Although these people were also frail, when their lives are at stake, they can only give chase.Suddenly the only remaining people were Long Hui and Wen Fei Chen.Long Hui\u2019s expression became a little gentler, he opened his mouth to ask, \u201cLord Wen, What happened?\u201dWen Fei Chen smiled wryly, \u201cI don\u2019t know what method that female used, but my strength has been sealed by three layers of Qi, that form a chain in my body locking my strength and world Qi.\u201cShe has such method unexpectedly?\u201d Long Hui looked aghast.Wen Fei Chen nodded, \u201cIt is so, those disciples also can\u2019t withstand this seal, now they can only display about thirty percent of their original strength.\u201d\u201cThen what should we do?\u201d Long Hui asked restlessly.\u201cNo need to worry.\u201d Wen Fei Chen shook his head: \u201cI haven\u2019t deceived the Storm House disciples, that female has used such a strong method and also had maintained that defensive treasure for such a long time, because of that there isn\u2019t a drop of World Qi remaining in her dantian and she has also been hit by me, she doesn\u2019t have the slightest fight remaining in her. As long as she is found by them she should be yours.Hearing this Long Hui breathed a sigh of relief, Long Hui has got a good impression of Wen Fei Chen since he been with him, he personally wanted Lord Wen in his group so he said, \u201cI will definitely tell grandfather about all the pains of Lord Wen this time.\u201d\u201cMaster Long doesn\u2019t need to worry, after all we are family.\u201d Wen Fei Chen smiled satisfied, \u201cNow I want to ask Master Long to protect the Buddhist law for me, I want to see if I can break this chain of Yin Qi.\u201d\u201cNo problem!\u201dIn their talk they didn\u2019t mention Kai Yang. In their eyes Xia Ning Chang is a thorny existence and Kai Yang is a nobody, Xia Ning Chang was a severely debilitated, as long as she was captured it was their win.At this moment Kai Yang had brought Xia Ning Chang to the edge of the mountain valley and had found a crack in the mountain which was only a few feet high and a few feet deep, which the two of them can easily fit into.Placing Xia Ning Chang inside it, Kai Yang went out and covered the entrance with loose bush to block it from plain sight.Then Kai Yang had to hold her so tightly that it felt like they had melted into one person.\u201cDo not speak, some people are pursuing.\u201d Kai Yang said softly as he hugged Xia Ning Cheng.Xia Ning Chang looked pale, she concentrated on holding her breath and making no sound.After a little while Nu Lang and his people flashed passed the entrance, the sound of footsteps gradually went further and further away. Both sides had been separated by a distance of only a few feet, but on this night this valley was filled with dense Yin Qi letting Kai Yang and Xia Ning Chang hide perfectly without being detected.After Nu Lang and his group went far away, Xia Ning Chang was finally unable to bear it any longer and spurted out blood, the silk on her mask immediately turned a dark red colour. Wen Fei Chen\u2019s attack a moment ago had injured her.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Kai Yang asked anxiously.\u201cHelp me take the compounding drug.\u201d Xia Ning Chang\u2019s voice sounded weak, her body collapsed softly onto the ground, she didn\u2019t even have enough strength to move her finger.\u201cWhere is the drug?\u201d\u201cIn my bosom.\u201dKai Yang hastily put his hand in her bosom to search, in the next moment he is struck by lightning and looks at his little senior sister.Xia Ning Chang is also looking at him, on her pale complexion appears a hint of a blush, her body shivers slightly, just when Kai Yang was searching around her jade like front, she felt like lighting was passing through her body paralyzing her, she nearly fainted on the scene.\u201cPlease hold on.\u201d Kai Yang knew that this was not the moment to be sentimental, he whispered this to Xia Ning Chang and his hand once again began to search in her cloths to try and find the compounding drug.Xia Ning Chang was only wearing outer women\u2019s clothing inside of which is only her skin. Kai Yang's hands tracing this felt like they had entered her immortal place, one which makes humans forget to return.One pair of full, soft bulges which have an astonishing elasticity, they are neither small nor big, his palm can encompass them perfectly, his five fingers move over her bulges for a while. Every time there is a movement the energy from the movement makes her body tremble, feeling each other\u2019s body, just after a few moments, both Kai Yang and Xia Ning Chang\u2019s breathing becomes rapid and the blood starts to flow faster.Kai Yang is still okay, although this matter is somewhat awkward, he is a man with a thick skin and doesn\u2019t consider this a serious matter.On the contrary Xia Ning Chang\u2019s limp eyes contained a trace of youthful love, although her eyes also have traces of shame and anger, the fragrance of her breath has the power to even attract the spirit of a person, with an unspeakable innocence.\u201cDon\u2019t think anything.\u201d On the other hand Kai Yang\u2019s hand\u2019s are comfortably fumbling inside her clothes.Xia Ning Chang finally couldn\u2019t bear it and said in a weak voice, \u201cOn the other side.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d Kai Yang finally recovered, searching in her secret passage for such a long time and could not find it because originally it was not there.This thing is troublesome\u2026\u2026His other hand searches the other side and goes deeper inside, eventually he found several bottles, in the meantime he had been shaken several times by Xia Ning Chang.\u201cWhich one is needed?\u201d Kai Yang asked.\u201cThe middle bottle.\u201d Xia Ning Chang replied weakly, secretly looking at him.Kai Yang hurriedly took out the middle bottle, pouring some compounding drugs from this bottle he lifted her face then forcefully placed the drug in her mouth.His little senior sister has a special physique; she has a medicine spirit body, which is the best in this world best body for the consumption of medicine. They can eat as many medicines as they like without any side effects.Several compounding drugs enter her abdomen while she sits in a meditative position, meanwhile Kai Yang turned around and remained alert for any traces of sound outside.After about half an hour, Xia Ning Chang gradually recovered, opening her eyes her face is covered by a shy blush, she was looking towards Kai Yang with mixed feelings.After thinking about what happened a moment ago, her cheeks became hot, although she knows that at that time there were no alternatives, Xia Ning Chang still felt like digging a hole a crawling into it.As if feeling the gaze of Xia Ning Chang, Kai Yang who was on lookout turned his head, seeing Xia Ning Chang had finished her restoration, he couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cAre you alright?\u201dXia Ning Chang\u2019s eyes flash with panic, she quickly turned her head before replying, \u201cAlthough there is no danger to my life, I will not be able to fight at least for now.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s alright.\u201d The knot in Kai Yang\u2019s heart finally loosened.p.s.

Back then, I hadn\u2019t thought this place would turn out to be a lifesaver.\u201d\u201cThis is truly too lucky.\u201d Xia Ning Chang said while sighing.\u201cYou should have a good rest. As soon as things calm down, I will take you out of here.\u201dXia Ning Chang looked gloomy as he said this. She shook her head and slowly, said: \u201cWe can\u2019t leave this place.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t everything depend on one\u2019s skills and effort, so how are we unable to leave here?\u201d Kai Yang chuckled.\u201cSince I unsealed the Nine Cloud Eight Locks, this entire mountain valley has been sealed off. Before dawn, no one will be able to escape from here.\u201dKai Yang froze, realising the meaning of her words: \u201cWhen you left me, it was to prepare this formation?\u201dXia Ning Chang nodded slightly: \u201cI wanted to use this formation to deal with the Nine Yin Dew Crystals, but I was forced to activate it before the scheduled time.\u201d\u201cWhere those black chains the result of the formation?\u201d Kai Yang asked as he recalled the scene that had occurred moments ago.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have been killed by it already, would they?\u201d Kai Yang questioned hopefully. If all of those powerhouse died, then they could certainly escape this time.Xia Ning Chang shook her head, \u201cNo, this formation is unable to kill them; those people are no weaklings. This formation will only be able to eliminate one or two of them, those with the lowest strength among them, at most.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not too bad either.\u201d Kai Yang secretly thought to himself that it was a pity.\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u2026\u2026although it is unable to kill them, with all the Yin Qi from the chains invading their body, most of their strength will be sealed. And before dawn they will be unable to unseal themselves and restore their strength. I also think that before dawn, I will be able to recover some of my Qi, then we will be able to escape together.\u201dSuddenly Kai Yang\u2019s eyes were filled with aggressiveness, he looked at Xia Ning Chang and asked in an excited voice: \u201cYou said their cultivations were sealed, how much of their power was sealed?\u201dXia Ning Chang thought for a moment: \u201cAt least 60-70%. For that powerhouse at the true elemental boundary, it should be around 80%.\u201d\u201cSo that means they won\u2019t be able to display their destructive might.\u201d Kai Yang looked excited and was filled with an urge to test himself and his limits.Xia Ning Chang looked at him nervously: \u201cWhat are you thinking about? Even if their strength has been sealed, you won\u2019t be able to deal with them, so junior brother please do not act rashly.\u201dShe had seen through what Kai Yang was thinking.Kai Yang chuckled, his eyes hiding a hint of mischief, he replied: \u201cHow will we know if we don\u2019t try? Don\u2019t forget, this is the place where the Nine Yin Dew Crystals gather. Not only are their cultivations sealed, but in order to resist the invasion of Yin Qi, they will need to use World Qi. So as time passes they will gradually become weaker and weaker.\u201d\u201cBut there are so many of them!\u201d Xia Ning Chang grabbed Kai Yang\u2019s hand and shook her head repeatedly: \u201cDon\u2019t be hasty!\u201dKai Yang patted her hands gently: \u201cRelax, I have confidence. If we continue to hide here, sooner or later we will be discovered. At that time, we will become turtles that have been flipped onto their backs, who can only wait for death. If we take the initiative and attack, then perhaps we will have a small chance.\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201d Xia Ning Chang shook her head like a rattle-drum: \u201cI am your senior sister, so you must listen to me. If you go out now, you won\u2019t have any way to resist; the Yin Qi in the Valley will be enough to consume your World Qi.\u201d(TLN: Rattle drums are toys that Chinese children play with. You shake side to side, to make the little balled drum on the drum. It\u2019s actually quite amusing.)\u201cLittle senior sister, if you want to live, then please don\u2019t stop me. You also saw that Long Hui\u2019s mentality and you should know what fate lies in store for you if you fall into his hands.\u201dXia Ning Chang\u2019s body trembled fiercely.\u201cSince this is the case, do not block me.\u201d Kai Yang shook off Xia Ning Chang\u2019s hand.\u201cIf you are this insistent on going out, then at least take this treasure with you.\u201d Xia Ning Chang said helplessly. If Kai Yang wanted to leave, she wouldn\u2019t be able to stop him with her present strength. She could only hand over the jade pendent.\u201cYou need this more than me.\u201d Kai Yang said rejecting her flatly. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be worried about me. Although I am only at the initial element fourth stage, I still possess a method to restore my World Qi, and the Yin Qi in this mountain valley cannot affect me. On the contrary, if someone was able to find this place, would you be able to fend them off?\u201d\u201cI have already restored some of my World Qi, so I will be able to activate the defensive artifact again. Furthermore, with their true strength already suppressed, they won\u2019t able to threaten me.\u201d Xia Ning Chang said.\u201cThat\u2019s a relief!\u201d Kai Yang slowly walked towards the exit.Restraining himself for so long, he was finally going to be able to get some action going. Kai Yang looked quite ferocious.After walking a few steps Kai Yang suddenly stopped, then whispered: \u201cLittle senior sister, if by dawn I don\u2019t come back, then return to Sky Tower as soon as possible.\u201dXia Ning Chang\u2019s heart clenched, an indescribable pain spread throughout her heart.Kai Yang smiled at her and reassured her: \u201cIf I come back, will you promise me one thing?\u201d\u201cPromise you what?\u201d Xia Ning Chang asked, enduring the pain in her heart.\u201cWhen I come back, I will tell you it.\u201d Kai Yang said chuckling. Exiting the cave sideways, he descended towards the bottom of mountain. Coming out, he covered the crevice behind him. After checking that everything had been covered properly, he disappeared into darkness.Leaving behind Xia Ning Chang alone in that desolate cave.There were still three or four hours remaining until dawn would arrive, while there were a lot of enemies for him to take care of in this time. This sure would be a difficult fight.In the forest, some people were moving about at high speeds. Listening to the sound of the footsteps, it sounded like there was two people. Kai Yang hid behind a big tree, calmly waiting for them to draw closer.He had no idea which group that pair belonged to nor their cultivation levels. So for the time being, he could only observe them and then plan accordingly.If the two of them were strong, he could only avoid them and wait for the first sign of weakness.As the sound of the footsteps got closer, someone spoke up: \u201cSenior brother Xiong, where did they go? We have looked for them for so long yet are still unable to find them.\u201dAnother voiced replied: \u201cJunior brother, you should not be worried. Senior brother Nu and those brutes from the Blood Group are also searching, so Kai Yang will not be able to hide for long. We are only putting on a front, and perhaps right as we speak, they have already found Kai Yang and that female.The disciple nodded: \u201cIt\u2019s just a pity, that girl really is a beauty. Falling into the hands of Long Hui; I don\u2019t want to imagine how she will be played with.\u201dBrother Xiong sneered: \u201cLong Hui is a sex maniac and doomed to not have any great achievements. In the future when we become stronger, we will have our good times.\u201dWhile he was speaking, a figure had suddenly appeared a few feet in front of the Storm House disciples. Stopping suddenly, senior brother Xiong shouted: \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201dA light chuckle could be heard from the side: \u201cAren\u2019t you looking for me?\u201d\u201cKai Yang!\u201d Brother Xiong became overjoyed; for in such a hopeless situation, bumping into Kai Yang without even setting a trap sure was lucky. Now they wouldn\u2019t have to waste any effort attempting to draw him out.(TL: What? A Kai Yang is something you hunt? A rare hunt? Ohh look, it\u2019s a Kai Yang! Spawn rate of 0.001%! Lucky us~)Brother Xiong became excited, Kai Yang was also happy.From their conversation earlier Kai Yang knew of their statuses; the Storm House group consisted of five people. Except for Nu Lang, who was at the qi transforming first stage the remaining four disciples were all at the initial element stages.Cultivators of this level, Kai Yang didn\u2019t fear at all.p.s.

In his hand was also a sharp weapon which further increased his advantage.The move he executed was only for probing, brother Xiong did not believe he would be able to get rid of Kai Yang with this move.In the darkness the sword flashed before Kai Yang, Kai Yang quickly moved sideways to dodge, following this brother Xiong raised his sword again and attacked Kai Yang several times in succession, Kai Yang dodged all of his attacks, after this exchange they both stepped back from each other.Brother Xiong laughed, \u201cA rice grain dares to dream of glory, Kai Yang your life is mine to take. Come!\u201dThe previous attacks had given him get a clear understanding of Kai Yang\u2019s strength, now that he had a basic idea about how Kai Yang fought he could easily kill him, activating his World Qi, wind and lightning sounds came from senior brother Xiong\u2019s blade.\u201cThunder Wind Cry!\u201d Brother Xiong swung his sword heavily, on his long sword there was lighting visible, which in turn produced an arc of lightning as he swung his sword, this arc was incomparably sharp and was moving towards Kai Yang\u2019s chest at great speed, Kai Yang was left unable to dodge this attack.Kai Yang really was unable to dodge this attack, but on his face there was no trace of panic, instead he simply raised his palm towards the blade.Brother Xiong sneered, in his heart he was thinking the body of this sword is covered in lightning and you are merely an initial element boundary fourth level, if it touches you then you will be paralyzed and will be at my mercy.Thinking this Brother Xiong increased the speed at which the blade was approaching Kai Yang.Kai Yang made a low sound, his palm became incomparably red, just like a burning flame, brother Xiong felt a heat wave coming towards him which not only removed the cold from the surrounding area but also made him feel like he was crashing into a sea of fire, this made him feel like he was actually on fire.\u201cClang\u2026\u2026.\u201d A metallic sound could be heard, Kai Yang\u2019s palm was on top of the sword, whenever his palm came into contact with lightning, the lightning would just suddenly vanish, due to this sudden collision, the long sword was also diverted from its original path, instead it ended up merely scratching Kai Yang\u2019s shoulder without injuring him.Brother Xiong became startled, in this confrontation he had found that his World Qi was simply not a match for his opponent\u2019s. Could it be that he was not an initial element fourth level practitioner afterall? Could his World Qi actually be more concentrated than his own?Moreover the World Qi contained in Kai Yang\u2019s palm a moment ago was truly too pure, otherwise it would be impossible for it to extinguish the lightning on his sword.Brother Xiong became uneasy as he thought of these things, retrieving his sword he hurriedly retreated away from Kai Yang, he was preparing to stabilize his Qi before trying again, but was Kai Yang going to give him this chance? While retreating brother Xiong became unbalanced, in his gaze there was now a trace of fear, he felt a fist impact against his stomach, then blood spurted out from his mouth.Kai Yang knew that he needed to deal with a lot of enemies, so he was in a hurry to deal with these two, he didn\u2019t even hesitate to consume a drop of Yang liquid, using it in his strike to kill his opponent as soon as possible.Brother Xiong\u2019s body stopped moving and became motionless, the only remaining sound was the howling of the Yin Qi throughout the mountain valley which also created an eerie atmosphere.The younger disciple from Storm House didn\u2019t understand what had occurred and after a short while he called out in a soft voice, \u201cXiong elder brother, bro\u2026. Brother Xiong.\u201dBefore his voice had fallen, brother Xiong\u2019s body fell to the ground, Kai Yang grinned suddenly, straightening his body he said, \u201cYour elder brother Xiong just set foot on the road to the Yellow Springs and will be waiting for you.\u201dThe younger disciple stared dumbfounded at Kai Yang before making a strange cry and attempting to run for it.His strength was inferior to brother Xiong, he was only at the initial element boundary fifth level, Kai Yang had killed elder brother Xiong in one move, how could he have enough strength to cope with him?\u201cRunning away?\u201d Kai Yang sneered, in his hand he was holding Xiong\u2019s long sword while he pursued.It could be said that the Yin Qi in the mountain valley was helping Kai Yang, everyone was suffering under the corrosive effect of the Yin Qi and their strength was reduced, only Kai Yang who had practiced the True Yang tactics, which was a natural counter to Yin Qi, simply didn\u2019t need to worry about it affecting him.He just needed to consume a little of his Yang Qi to scatter the chill in his surroundings.Although the young disciple from Storm House was an initial element boundary fifth level practitioner, in this mountain valley the strength he could wield was comparatively lower.After pursuing him for a short while, the distance between Kai Yang and him was reduced greatly, now he was merely 10 feet away, this distance was close enough.Kai Yang threw the long sword while he was running, the sound of the wind being cut could be heard, the young disciple initiated a movement martial art with the intent of dodging.But without enough time to complete his skill, the distance of ten feet had become zero.Seeing no way to escape the Storm House disciple became decisive, turning around quickly, he took out his own weapon, but he only saw a streak of bright red light coming his way, almost by instinct he crossed his long sword over his body to block the attack.Bang\u2026\u2026 bang, the bright red weapon cut through his sword like a knife cutting through tofu, his weapon was instantly cut in half, in the next moment he felt his neck becoming hot, however was no longer able to distinguish between the different directions and fell down.Kai Yang stopped, in his fingers he was holding a bright red long sword, which was dripping blood.The disciple from Storm House rolled over, he was staring up at Kai Yang, he was not even able to make a single sound, after a moment his head suddenly burst open and it looked like bloody rain was falling from the sky.They were both dead!He had won this battle easily, he didn\u2019t even need to use the golden skeleton and was still able to deal with them, in previous fights Kai Yang always needed to rely on that mysterious skill every time he fought with an enemy, but this time he discovered that even without using that mysterious skill he was able to fight with people at higher levels of cultivation than him.Kai Yang thought that it was necessary to re-examine his strength.Kai Yang was about to leave the scene, however from both sides of his current location he could hear the sound of clothes flapping due to the wind.From left it sounded like two people were coming, while from right it only sounded like there was one person. It should be the strange sounding cry made by the young disciple which had attracted them.Kai Yang wanted to hide, but after thinking carefully for a moment he rapidly closed in on the sound coming from his left side instead.It was he had thought, these were the remaining three disciples from Storm House.They had thought that looking separately would be more effective, so they had separated from each other but still didn\u2019t go too far from each other.Now the remaining three were all coming, it was naturally what he had wished for. The strength of the Storm House disciples was much lower than the strength of those from the Blood Group.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Martial PeakChapter 98 \u2013 Killing two morePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 98- Killing two moreTranslator -ErzaEditor -BenIt was only that between these three people, only Nu Lang was at the qi transforming first stage. So if he wanted to take them down, it would a bit more troublesome.So that\u2019s why Kai Yang needed to first deal with the other two Storm House disciples that were only at the initial element stage, before he could put all his heart into fighting Nu Lang.Looking at himself, Kai Yang wondered if he could fight against a qi transforming practitioner! Thinking about this, Kai Yang\u2019s blood began to boil in anticipation.What Kai Yang had predicted was on point; the two disciples that had come from the left, truly were Storm House disciples. Their cultivations were also at around the same level as the other two whom he had killed; even if they could be considered strong, they weren\u2019t especially strong.Hearing the cries of their junior brothers they had rushed in the direction from which they had heard them, however before the two could even arrive at the location of the sound someone had already been sent flying away.\u201cWho!\u201d Stopping in their tracks, the two Storm House disciples became alert.Not replying, Kai Yang instead quickened his pace and threw himself onto them. Sensing Kai Yang\u2019s killing intent and hostility, how could those two be unable to react? They immediately cried out: \u201cIt\u2019s Kai Yang!\u201dJust as they finished speaking, their weapons appeared in their hands. One from the right, one from the left, they jumped towards Kai Yang.With Kai Yang\u2019s battle spirit aroused, he met their attacks without theslightest bit of fear. Fast as lightning, the blood red blade once again appeared within his hands and he targeted one of the attackers.The disciple who was being attacked, raised their blade to block theincoming strike. But how could his ordinary grade weapon possiblycompare to a drop of Yang Qi? As the two blades met, the Storm House disciple's blade broke in two. Thankfully his reactions were fast enough for him to hurriedly dodge that life threatening strike, as it skimmed the side of his rib.Shing, the sound of the blade skimming his rib rang out\u2026\u2026.The disciple in question cried out in agony, feeling as if a flaming piece of metal was branding him. Immediately the taste of burnt flesh could be sensed in the air.(TL: Oh nasty~)\u201cSenior brother!\u201d The other person\u2019s complexion changed greatly as he quickly withdrew his previous attack.In this life or death situation, he re-evaluated himself and realised he had put himself right under Kai Yang\u2019s blade.How could Kai Yang be merciful with regards to them? Right after the breaking of the blade, Kai Yang sent a palm strike towards the Storm House disciple\u2019s solar plexus, causing fiery hot World Qi to enter his body. Once the World Qi entered his body, that person\u2019s eyes bulged out as he flew backwards. Landing on the ground, he jerked a few times before ceasing all movement.In an instant he had killed another Storm House disciple; and that death was far faster than the one suffered by his preceding senior brother.Before Kai Yang could initiate another strike, the other Storm House disciple who was still alive, swung his blade.Unable to dodge, Kai Yang tensed all his muscles in preparation of receiving the strike.\u201cShua\u2026\u2026.\u201d As the blade glinted with light, it cut open his abdomen area. Immediately pain flared throughout his body originating from that wound, and blood spewed out. But Kai Yang still remained unmoved. He only became more vicious and bloodthirsty as he turned his head towards that disciple.That person had personally seen his junior brother killed right in front of his eyes. So how could he be think about anything else? He had only harboured thoughts about killing Kai Yang right that instant, in order to avenge his junior brother\u2019s death. Right after his first slice, he raised his sword again and this time he aimed straight for Kai Yang\u2019s throat.Kai Yang only raised his arm to block the incoming strike. The blade caused an inch long wound to appear on his arm, only to be stopped by his bone, unable to penetrate further down.\u201cHehe!\u201d As the blood dripped down, Kai Yang only sardonically laughed.(TL: I\u2019m starting to worry for Kai Yang\u2019s mental state\u2026\u2026...)Within the darkness, a set of of ivory white teeth appeared; they were like the teeth of a night predator. The current Kai Yang, from head to toe, emitted an demonic aura!Kai Yang was vicious, excited and emitting a demonic aura! That smile alone would make anyone who saw it tremble with fear!\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d How could that still living Storm House disciple have ever had the opportunity to see someone like him before? After receiving two wounds, he could still smile. Was this person a madman?His mind a mess, he only wanted to retreat. In this death match, to be intimidated by the opponent\u2019s aura alone, how could he possibly hope to survive?Kai Yang\u2019s leg immediately flew out, aiming for his crotch. The sound of something breaking rang out. That person immediatelyarched his back and fell to his knees; his face deathly pale.Swiftly, Kai Yang extracted the sword embedded within his arm and swung it down to finish the job.He had killed two more!\u201cShua!\u201d It wasn\u2019t until then, that the person hurrying over from the right side finally arrived at the scene. It was Nu Lang! The five disciple from Storm House had split into three groups and had been searching in the vicinity for Kai Yang and Xia Ning Chang\u2019s footprints. Unexpectedly, they were finished off one by one by Kai Yang.His gaze sweeping the scene, Nu Lang saw his two junior brothers lying dead on the ground. In an instant, he turned around and said in a very furious tone: \u201cWas it you who killed them?\u201dKai Yang turned his head; within that insane gaze of his, was a calm and collected coldness.\u201cIt looks like everyone had underestimated you. You actually possessed such abilities.\u201d His expression hazy, Nu Lang forcibly suppressed his inner rage. Taking a deep breath, he continued solemnly: \u201cI have something to ask you.\u201d\u201cNo need to ask. Nu Tao and Cheng Shao Feng were killed by me. You guessed correctly!\u201d\u201cIt really was you!\u201d Nu Lang\u2019s body suddenly began to shake; he hadalways held the hope that his younger brother had lost himself while playing around. Although the chances of that actually happening were very low, it was still a hope he had clung onto.But now, that sliver of hope had been shattered by Kai Yang! He had personally admitted that his younger brother\u2019s disappearance was related to him and that he had actually killed him!\u201cThey wanted to kill me, so naturally I also had the right to kill them!\u201d Kai Yang seemed a bit impatient, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk anymore nonsense. Let\u2019s battle!\u201d\u201cGood, good, good.\u201d Nu Lang\u2019s killing intent was seething as he told Kai Yang in a voice dripping with poison: \u201cSince you dared to act and dared to admit it, then I shall not say anymore. Today, I shall use your life as a sacrifice for those who died!\u201dBetween words, Nu Land readied himself and rushed forward. His body flickering, he arrived in front of Kia Yang in an instant. His hand curled like an eagle\u2019s claw, he slashed horizontally at Kai Yang\u2019s throat.Kia Yang\u2019s expression hardened; a qi transforming stage practitioner\u2019s power was truly incomparable to one at the initial element stage. Their power really couldn\u2019t be compared.Hurriedly, Kai Yang leaned backwards and used his hands to cover his throat; the vital area.Nu Lang only smiled out coldly, and his five fingers actually changed directions midway; directly aiming downwards.Whoosh\u2026\u2026Kai Yang took a few steps backwards. Looking down, he saw his clothes ripped and five, bloody, clawlike marks across his stomach. Accompanying the marks, he felt a strange energy enter him.Activating his True Yang Tactics, he immediately dissolved that strange energy.\u201cA mere initial element fourth stage practitioner actually dares to act presumptuous in front of me! I won\u2019t kill you quickly, but instead torment you to the point that you wish you could die but can\u2019t!\u201d With his successful strike, Nu Lang\u2019s expression became more and more sinister.\u201cA flowery strike and fancy footwork, you fight like a girl. Aren\u2019t you ashamed?\u201d Kai Yang immediately tore off his ragged clothing, revealing his skinny and shrivelled body, coldly mocking him.Nu Lang\u2019s face reddened, but he couldn\u2019t retort; who told him to train in the claw arts? This truly wasn\u2019t a elegant art.\u201cA tongue as sharp as ivory, I hope that later you won\u2019t beg for mercy!\u201d Nu Lang didn\u2019t want to battle with words. Moving both his hands, they took on the shape of a hawk\u2019s claws, and once again he began to attack Kai Yang.\u201cHow about you taste the might of my fists too?\u201d Laughing loudly, Kai Yang rushed forward to meet those two claws head on.\u201cYou overestimate yourself!\u201d Nu Lang laughed coldly. With his cultivation at the qi transforming stage, even if it was a boulder, he could still claw through it. So how could he not do the same to someone at the initial element fourth stage?p.s. tomorrow next chapter. have a grt day.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Kai Yang\u2019s fist had violently attacked Nu Lang\u2019s hands, but they had both caught each other's attack and interlocked fingers to prevent the other from retreating.At this moment, World Qi from both of them simultaneously burst out, fiercely colliding within their palms.\u201cWhat?\u201d Nu Lang was astonished. He discovered that Kai Yang\u2019s World Qi was more overbearing than his own and he wasn\u2019t able to resist it for a long time.How is this possible? The difference between their strength was so large, it was impossible for Kai Yang to be a threat to him. But looking at the facts in front of him it looked like he couldn\u2019t afford to be careless.If he refused to back down now, perhaps his fingers would be burnt to a crisp.Thinking about this Nu Lang hurriedly withdrew, jumping back several feet. While he was withdrawing he hastily dissolved the Kai Yang\u2019s burning hot World Qi which was invading his body.Looking at Kai Yang, Nu Lang became even more surprised because his move had failed to break even one of Kai Yang\u2019s fingers.Although Kai Yang\u2019s fingers had holes in them, it hadn\u2019t gone as planned, with the grasp a moment ago he should have been able to crumble Kai Yang\u2019s fist.This boy\u2026\u2026.really has some methods. No wonder my brothers were all killed by him. Looks like it wasn\u2019t just luck after all, Nu Lang was forced to become serious.Kai Yang shook his fist, after looking down at his hands, when he lifted his head his eyes contained even more excitement and anticipation.The uncertainty as to the outcome of this battle, had made his blood boil with excitement, feeling the pain from his wound, feeling the pressure from the enemy, all of this had made Kai Yang\u2019s Indomitable Will to awaken.The unyielding will to win and determination to rise, only this would lead to the awaking of his mysterious martial arts.Finally, the moment had come.Kai Yang didn\u2019t need to suppress his strength anymore.From deep within his bones a boiling hot strength flowed into Kai Yang. With this power Kai Yang felt like a whole new person.Previously he had always accidentally triggered his Indomitable Will. During those times he would become a little perplexed, because even though he would win he didn\u2019t understand the reason for his win, it would also leave any nearby people bewildered.But this time it was different, he could feel a huge quantity of energy pouring out from his bones into his meridians, nourishing his flesh and blood, promoting his strength crazily.\u201cCome again!\u201d Kai Yang was like an apex predator in the jungle. His eyes were staring at Nu Lang stubbornly, Kai Yang shot forward like a bullet while punching out.It was a basic punch just like the one moments ago.\u201cCourting Death!\u201d Nu Lang sneered, although he was surprised by Kai Yang\u2019s World Qi, based on Kai Yang\u2019s strength he wouldn\u2019t be able to hurt him. As long as he is able to receive his fist and dissolve his World Qi it would be impossible for him to get injured.Kai Yang will once again be injured by me, just like a moment ago, only this time his whole fist will be crushed. It could be said that Kai Yang had chosen quite the rash method. Nu Lang looked confident in his ability to win this exchange.Sneering, Nu Lang caught Kai Yang\u2019s fist just like the previous time.In the second confrontation, Nu Lang felt that something was not quite right, because the might of Kai Yang\u2019s fist had become greater than the punch a moment ago, the World Qi it contained had also become fiercer than before.Kai Yang\u2019s strength suddenly reached the initial element fifth level.But how was this possible? Be it practitioners at the initial element fourth level or fifth level, in his eyes they were like commoners, they couldn\u2019t threaten him, rather they can simply be killed with little effort.In this confrontation the injury on Kai Yang\u2019s hand was becoming more serious. Blood dripped and Kai Yang moved back. Nu Lang was in hot pursuit, his fingers were cutting through the air with a howling sound, in the darkness Nu Lang was attacking Kai Yang repeatedly.Kai Yang was silently dodging Nu Lang\u2019s attacks. While Nu Lang was attacking Kai Yang was countering with his fists, left fist then right fist in a rhythmic manner. Although the injuries on his hands were not light he was still able to block all of Nu Lang\u2019s attacks. He couldn\u2019t let Nu Lang have a chance to take his life.Dull thumping sounds rang out in the dark night one after another, with each sound Kai Yang\u2019s body would fall back several steps. The injury on his hand was becoming more and more serious.But his eyes didn\u2019t show the slightest hint of panic, but rather carried a determination, a will to win this fight had been born in his heart, he was simply waiting for the right moment to attack.\u201cHow is this even possible?\u201d Nu Lang had become completely shocked, however at present it seemed like Nu Lang had the upper hand. After all he was an entire boundary higher when compared to Kai Yang, if he was still unable to gain the upper hand then he had practiced these many years in vain.Nu Lang swallowed his spit; his ten fingers had been burnt by Kai Yang\u2019s hot World Qi. Each of his fingers had been covered in blisters. His fingers felt like they were constantly on fire. Since one's fingers are connected to one\u2019s heart, moving his fingers made his heart become cold due to the pain.If it was only this much then Nu Lang wouldn\u2019t be shocked. What truly shocked him was the strength of Kai Yang.In their first confrontation Kai Yang was merely a trivial initial element fourth level practitioner, such a level wasn\u2019t sufficient to make him fear.But during their second confrontation he had achieved initial element fifth level.In the fourth clash his strength had increased yet again, he had reached the initial element sixth level.The seventh clash, he reached the initial element seventh level.In the twelfth clash, he reached the initial element eighth level.As he continues to fight, his strength continues to increase, which is a very sly, unique and unimaginable thing.Moreover this rise in strength was showing no signs of stopping.Nu Lang had become dismayed; he didn\u2019t know that Kai Yang could increase his strength nor to what degree he could. If he continued and reached the Qi transforming stage, he couldn\u2019t hope to win, because the World Qi of Kai Yang was too overbearing.After a joss stick time had passed, Nu Lang had realised he was unable to directly confront Kai Yang. Nu Lang was not a dull witted person, with each confrontation Kai Yang\u2019s body was becoming steadier, he was now as steady as a rock, standing in same place motionless. On the contrary, after each strike Nu Lang was suffering greater and greater amounts of backlash.Nu Lang could only use his agility and his flexible style, to look for a weakness in Kai Yang, attempting to strike Kai Yang a fatal blow.But the defense of Kai Yang was simply overbearing, so much so that no weakness could be found.Initial element ninth level! Nu Lang\u2019s eyes trembled. He discovered that along with each confrontation, Kai Yang\u2019s strength really did climb to another level; it had climbed directly to the peak of the initial element boundary.But with this his World Qi finally calmed down, it no longer continued to increase. With this Nu Lang could finally let out a sigh of relief.Although he was only at the Qi transforming stage first level, which was just one level higher compared to the initial element peak, this small gap of just one level represented a large gap in terms of strength.Therefore Nu Lang had confidence in being able to strike a fatal blow against Kai Yang.He increased his strength by eating a compounding drug, which one he didn\u2019t know. But no matter which compounding drug he ate, there certainly would be consequences. Kai Yang was originally at the initial element stage fourth level thus, his current storage capacity of World Qi was still limited to this, he was unable to store the same quantity of World Qi as someone truly of the initial element peak level. Nu Lang just needed to wait for Kai Yang\u2019s strength to be used up and then he would be able to strike a fatal blow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And from within the darkness, a fiery hot brilliance burst out. This scared Nu Lang and he became confused.Looking at Kai Yang he saw that his upper body was cloaked in raging light in the form of flames.They weren\u2019t true flames, but rather what Yang Qi looked like when it had reached a certain degree of concentration. Flaming hot World Qi burned around Kai Yang, sending waves of heat out into the mountain valley. The Yin Qi reacted like it had met its\u2019 worst nightmare, as it could no longer condense around the area affected by the Yang Qi.Due to the light of the flaming World Qi, Kai Yang\u2019s ** upper body became unclear. It was purifying and binding his muscles, appearing unrestrained as it spread all over.Both his fists were bloody and mutilated, he had a thirty centimeter long gash on his abdomen, which was still bleeding. His battered body was terrorising to look at, both his eyes had also turned scarlet. He appeared akin to a beast emitting an aura with an endless amount of bloodthirst and insanity.Truly a demonic aura!Nu Lang\u2019s face dropped as he hurriedly took a few steps backwards and shouted out: \u201cBerserk magic?\u201dHe thought that during the battle, Kai Yang had lost control of his World Qi and had allowed his World Qi to control his mind.But, shouldn\u2019t this situation only occur when a practitioner reached the qi transforming stage? He was merely an initial element staged practitioner, so how could this possibly occur to him?\u201cBerserk magic?\u201d Tilting his head, Kai Yang looked over questioningly. Although his eyes showed traces of rage, he still kept a cold and indifferent expression, like he hadn\u2019t been poisoned by some berserk magic at all: \u201cYour gaze is far too shortsighted!\u201dFinishing his statement, the World Qi all over his body receded. There was no longer the overpowering brilliance being emitted by the flames, they shrunk back until they only covered his two fists, coating them with a layer of flaming Yang World Qi.From the appearance, it looked as if those two fists were clasping onto two small flaming fires; although the flames were wavering, they persisted to burn with an unmatched intensity.\u201cYou are still conscious?\u201d Bewildered, Nu Lang looked towards Kai Yang as he searched for a sliver of humanity within his eyes. But he was disappointed, because within those two scarlet eyes, he couldn\u2019t find any trace of humanity nor human emotions. Only a crazy bloodthirst and a burning battle hunger lay within.This shouldn\u2019t be. Afterall, those were the symptoms of berserk magic; within his eyes, no trace of humanity was left. So why was it that he could still think?\u201cYou say I\u2019m not!\u201d Taking another step forwards, Kai Yang shortened the distance between them. This step caused the distance between them to close extremely fast. This caused Nu Lang to turn pale with fright, because Kai Yang\u2019s speed had already reached a frightening degree.Hastily he stepped back while lashing out with his claw shaped hands in a desperate attempt to stop Kai Yang\u2019s advance.Kai Yang\u2019s burning fists rushed out to meet that claw attack head on. Amidst the whistling sound of his strike, he smashed into Nu Lang\u2019s five fingers.\u201cKa cha\u2026..\u201d A crisp breaking sounded could be heard followed by a bloodcurdling scream emanating from Nu Lang. Following that, his entire body flew backwards and, when he landed on the ground, five throbs of pain could be felt from his hand. As far as Nu Lang could tell, his five fingers were badly twisted and no longer usable.There were burns all over his hand and all of his bones were broken!Not only that, there was also a very violent, overbearing and searing hot World Qi invading his body. Burning through his meridians and bloodstream.Nu Lang didn\u2019t dare to dally, and quickly used his other hand to stop the invasion of that World Qi in his disabled arm.Just as he finished doing this, a glimmer of light flashed past his eyes. Looking up he saw that Kai Yang had once again arrived at his side and that those fists of his were burning brighter.How could Nu Lang dare to continue fighting? It was only now that Nu Lang realised, that even with his newly acquired cultivation at the qi transforming first stage he was actually unable to defeat Kai Yang who was at the initial element third stage.Using all of his power, Nu Lang hurriedly retreated backwards and simultaneously wishlisted. Within that whistle, his fear and horror could be heard as his whistle echoed throughout the valley.A brilliant glow appeared at Kai Yang\u2019s feet, propelling him at an even greater speed than even before, it was so quick that he shocked even himself. Catching up, he viciously punched towards Nu Lang\u2019s retreating back.Peng, peng, peng\u2026\u2026Taking the blows, there was no way Nu Lang could resist as he entire being was beaten until he was muddle headed.After fifty paces or so, Nu Lang realised that he couldn\u2019t shake off Kai Yang and in an instant his blood boiled. Stopping suddenly, his expression became fierce as he shouted out: \u201cKai Yang don\u2019t you dare go to bully others! Eagle Soars in the Sky! Kill for me!\u201dThis was Nu Lang\u2019s most powerful class skill. As all of his World Qi condensed on his hands, his two hands criss-crossed in front of his body protecting his chest. Then as Kai Yang drew near, they simultaneously shot out, tearing out at him from both sides.All of his qi transforming first stage strength shot out, this was an attack that even Kai Yang did not dare to overlook. Kai Yang\u2019s face changed, as he could feel the great amount of killing power that lay in those hands.If he was captured by those claws, Kai Yang was afraid this chest would be ripped to shreds.In the midst of this Kai Yang instinctively leaned to the side and bravely lashed out with his flaming fists at Nu Lang\u2019s face.Both people were putting their lives on the line, and it was certain that this would be their final exchange. On the battlefield there was only life or death, one would fight desperately to survive. It was either I die or I win!(TLN: In reference to Sun Tzu\u2019s The Art of War. It\u2019s quite an interesting read. The theories and points are on point and very intellectual.)Peng!Kai Yang\u2019s fist collided with Nu Lang\u2019s face, and his five sense organs immediately distorted. Due to the sheer force of Kai Yang\u2019s fists, Nu Lang\u2019s entire being flew backwards, flipping in the air a few times before landing on the ground with a loud thud.Shua!Nu Lang\u2019s claw attack had also landed on Kai Yang\u2019s body. But contrary to what he had expected, it merely left ten bloody bloody traces; five were shallow, while five were deep.At the crucial moment, Kai Yang\u2019s decision to lean to the side had saved him. One of Nu Lang\u2019s hands had already been smashed and broken earlier, so his Eagle Soars in the Sky couldn\u2019t exhibit his true might and the power in both hands wasn\u2019t the same. With the differences in power, Kai Yang\u2019s lean caused both the claws to be unable to land at the same time; this was equivalent to breaking through Nu Lang\u2019s attack.This type of battle choice was fully dependant on one\u2019s quick-wittedness and instinct. In the heat of battle, Kai Yang didn\u2019t think too much, needless to say, this type of skill breaking method really was flawless.While the surroundings quickly settled down the outcome of this duel had finally become clear. Panting lightly, Kai Yang\u2019s body was still surrounded by that evil aura, meanwhile Nu Lang was like a dead dog, sprawled on the ground. Blood covered his face, and he directed a poisonous stare at Kai Yang who was advancing step by step towards him.\u201cEven if I become a ghost, I won\u2019t let you off!\u201d Nu Lang said hatefully as he swallowed a mouthful of blood.Looking down at him, Kai Yang lifted up a foot and suddenly stomped down.\u201cHa ha\u2026\u2026.the Blood Group\u2019s people will hear my call\u2026..they will come to kill\u2026\u2026..\u201d Before Nu Lang could complete his sentence, his neck was crushed by Kai Yang. His life snuffed out.Storm House\u2019s five people, the result: total defeat!Calmly standing still, Kai Yang sensed the state of his boiling blood and his battle urge. His face cold, as he pondered, thinking of a very insane plan.p.s. The fateful 100th chapter guys. Sorry for the delayed releases. I figured since this was the 100th chapters, we would have a small spam release of chapters. Enjoy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Kai Yang\u2019s cry easily reached the clouds; echoing continuously throughout the mountain valley.\u201cBastards of the Blood Group, come and fight with me.\u201d This was a call to battle, a flagrant provocation. \u201cI am here and I am waiting for you.\u201dHe didn\u2019t care if those words would bring him trouble. After all, before Nu Lang died he had also given away his position with his dying howl. Although the mountain valley only covered an area of several dozen miles in radius, in this dead quiet night, you were easily able to hear the slightest of sounds. So those people were most likely already rushing towards them.At this moment the safest choice would be to leave the area. After fighting three battles, one after another and killing five people, Kai Yang\u2019s World Qi was greatly depleted. Whilst his body had also received many wounds; both light and serious in nature. How could he confront people from the Blood Group in this state?Leaving that place and recovering his strength, before finding an opportunity to get rid of them, was without a doubt the best option.But Kai Yang couldn\u2019t leave, rather he would not leave. The reason being his strength had reached its peak, and if he left, his heart would become reluctant towards the idea of battling stronger opponents. He had decided he would live his life with an immovable will; if it weren\u2019t for his persistence, he would just be a simple person at the initial element boundary fourth level.With the enemies moving towards Kai Yang at full speed they arrived at his location quickly, however upon doing so they were highly surprised.All his efforts were for the simple goal of leaving Xia Ning Chang time to meditate and recover without any disturbances.The strength of this group from the Blood Group was much higher than those who were from Storm House. Most of them were cultivators of the separation and reunion boundaries. Cultivators at this level could easily kill Kai Yang, it would be like killing an ant. But their strength was currently being sealed by the Nine Cloud Eight Locks seal, so their present strength couldn\u2019t be estimated.Hearing Kai Yang\u2019s howl, Xia Ning Chang opened her eyes suddenly; her heart which was filled with regret was finally able to relax.\u201cHe has not died! He has not died!\u201dXia Ning Chang almost wanted to cry.She had been worrying about Kai Yang\u2019s safety and feared that he would never return and that she would lose him forever. His strength was far too low and opposing party had a lot of people; how could he possibly be able to resist them all?After Kai Yang departed, Xia Ning Chang had been constantly regretting letting him leave and scolding herself; lamenting over the fact that he was risking his life for her, yet she couldn\u2019t help him at all. But looking at her own condition, which had yet to even stabilize, it wasn\u2019t good. When Kai Yang walked out she wasn\u2019t able to block him.Since she was the one who had brought him to this place, involving him in such a life threatening situation, Xia Ning Chang felt extremely guilty. She was such a pure lady, thinking that all of this was her fault; she didn\u2019t even consider the possibility that the people from the Blood Group and Storm House were here to pursue Kai Yang.In other words, the main cause of this entire debacle was Kai Yang.However, at that moment Xia Ning Chang finally felt relieved, because Kai Yang was safe and his voice contained traces of his excitement along with a fearless will to engage in battle.Although she didn\u2019t know what he was facing at present, Xia Ning Chang thought that she could only try to recover her strength as soon as possible and then go and help him\u2026..save him.On the other side of mountain valley, both Wen Fei Chen, who was hurrying to dissolve the Yin Qi from the Nine Cloud Eight Lock, and Long Hui heard Kai Yang\u2019s howl.When he heard that sound, Wen Fei Chen\u2019s brows wrinkled, his concentration broke and he spat out a mouthful of blood.\u201cThat animal!\u201d Wen Fei Chen angrily cursed, because he had been at a crucial moment when he had become agitated by the howl; as a result he even received internal injury.\u201cLord Wen, how was the process of undoing the sealing?\u201d Long Hui asked, like he was concerned.Wen Fei Chen shook his head slowly: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look too good. This seal has surpassed my expectations and experience. I don\u2019t know whose disciple she is, or how was she able to arrange such a powerful seal.\u201dThe three Yin Qi chains didn\u2019t just lock his Qi flow in his meridians, but also locked his dantian. This caused his strength to only reach as high as the qi transformation stages third stage. And because of his consumption a few moments ago, it fell again by a few levels.Wen Fei Chen was fuming and he wished he could kill Kai Yang and that female over and over again. A true element fifth boundary master had unexpectedly been tricked by those two juniors. When had he ever been subjected to such shame?\u201cLord Wen you don\u2019t need to worry. Just now he has dared to expose himself, so he will surely die.\u201d Long Hui looked quite self assured; the corner of his mouth even carried a sneer.Wen Fei Chen was silent, because he knew the meaning of Kai Yang\u2019s howl. That howl was not the desperate howl of person meeting his end, rather it was a howl that contained an overwhelming urge to fight.But he was a trivial initial element boundary fourth staged disciple, why would he behave so wildly?Due to this, Wen Fei Chen thought something wasn\u2019t quite right, but he didn\u2019t take the matter to heart, thinking that Kai Yang was in an animalistic state, so it didn\u2019t matter anyway; he was going to die either way.(TL: Hasn\u2019t age and experience taught you anything? -_- TRUST YOUR GUT!)In the mountain valley everyone had different thoughts regarding this situation, while outside the mountain valley there was an old man flying rapidly through the air.The old man was breathing heavily and no World Qi fluctuations could be felt, making it impossible to sense his strength, but his speed was very fast.Within the blink of an eye he was able to cover a distance of over a couple thousand feet.The old man seemed very worried and anxious. Looking up at the sky, he felt extremely regretful.\u201cWent wrong, something has gone wrong. My child, you opened the seal ahead of time.\u201d The old man was muttering while dashing forwards.This old man was the Contribution Hall\u2019s Treasurer, Meng Wu Ya.While muttering this, Meng Wu Ya felt really ashamed. He had completely lost the face of his entire family. That night he was earnestly trying to convince his disciple not to come to this place where Nine Yin Dew Crystals gathered. The promotion to the true element boundary had nothing to do with gathering of the Nine Yin Dew Crystals. At the time Xia Ning Chang had also agreed like a clever and understanding child.That had caused Meng Wu Ya to become elated; Xia Ning Chang had also prepared many dishes and also several pots of good wine at that moment. On one hand Meng Wu Ya was eating and drinking, while discrediting Kai Yang on the other hand. He was telling her to stay as far away as possible from him.Meng Wu Ya had seen with his own eyes that his disciple cared deeply about Kai Yang. Although it wasn\u2019t to the degree of love between a man and a woman, it was a type of loving care. This wasn\u2019t a good sign and made Meng Wu Ya want to cut this love down at this budding stage.For so many years his beloved disciple had always been intelligent and obedient. Meng Wu Ya felt she was like his treasure and didn\u2019t want anyone to come near her. He was always fearful for her because her thoughts were extremely pure and she didn\u2019t even understand that there were people that were evil.Meng Wu Ya worried that if Kai Yang had evil intentions, what would he do if his beloved apprentice was enticed by him? Youth, it\u2019s then when love was always ignorant. Once his apprentice was enticed it would become a difficult matter to manage.So Meng Wu Ya harbored evil intentions towards them, his skin was thick and he was always a shameless fellow. Although in his heart he was ashamed, but in his mouth, he always had bad words for Kai Yang; that he was lustful in nature, he was a heartless fellow, his head was always filled with immoral thoughts, he was a evil person, etc.Meng Wu Ya had also spoken words of warning towards Xia Ning Chang, he seriously told her that: \u201cThis kind of person should not be respected and should be kept as far away as possible.\u201dp.s.
