Do you want to end up like that b*tch?!\u201d A greasy-looking, middle-aged man cursed with a crazed expression as he kicked ruthlessly at the teenage girl that was curled up on the floor beside him.3As he spoke, no one noticed the stiff fingers of the other, unconscious girl in the toilet suddenly tremble.With a splitting headache, Pei Yunge suddenly opened her eyes, a stark coldness glimmering in them!However, she found herself in a completely unfamiliar place.Where was this?She wasn\u2019t dead?!It was Pei Yunge\u2019s first time meeting such a strange incident. Immediately, before she could familiarize herself with her surroundings, the Director of the hospital, who was beside her, suddenly noticed her movements.1\u201cYo, the little b*tch is actually awake.\u201dThe fat face of the Director of the hospital was covered with a sinister smile, as he threw away the teenage girl covered in rags and stalked towards Pei Yunge.This Pei Yunge sounded so much better than the rest.Hearing this, together with the quick glance at what was happening, Pei Yunge felt a strange familiarity as a daring guess appeared in her mind.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cPei Yunge, quit acting like you\u2019ve lost your memories. Didn\u2019t you call yourself the Eldest Young Lady of the Qin family two days ago? You really have many tricks up your sleeves!\u201d The Director of the hospital sneered at her. However, Pei Yunge\u2019s expression bloomed after she heard his words.She realized why this scene felt so familiar.Wasn\u2019t this the storyline of the antisocial romance novel her secretary showed her the other day?8The novel was labeled as antisocial even though this novel had an enjoyable story, the character of the female protagonist, Qin Youjiao, was one that sought revenge for even the smallest grievances she faced. If a person refused to accept or obey her, they would lose everything they have.6On the other hand, the female side character that had the same name as her, Pei Yunge, was a character with the smallest presence in the entire novel. She grew up in an orphanage and was introverted and closed off, while she desired nothing more than kinship with a desperation that was almost frightening.When she was seventeen years old, Pei Yunge returned to the Qin family as the real young lady that was lost at birth. At first, Pei Yunge thought that she had gained three older brothers. However, she never imagined that a fake young lady \u2013 the female protagonist \u2013 had already taken her position.As such, her older brothers treated her coldly and disregarded her with contempt, only treating Qin Youjiao, the female protagonist, as their biological younger sister.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)1Over the past two years, Pei Yunge watched with defeated eyes how Qin Youjiao was treated and doted on as a princess by her older brothers, while she was merely an ugly duckling and couldn\u2019t compare to Qin Youjiao in all aspects. Because of her jealousy towards Qin Youjiao, she even said that Qin Youjiao had taken her everything, only to be side-eyed coldly by her older brothers.1However, the truth was that Qin Youjiao was the actual ruthless character. The epitome of a white lotus from those novels and dramas, she acted naive and innocent, yet conditioned the Qin brothers everyday by hinting that Pei Yunge\u2019s mental state wasn\u2019t normal and that she was too stubborn and getting darker by the day.5Even the fact that Pei Yunge had been sent into the mental hospital was arranged by Qin Youjiao alone, by making the brothers see a \u2018crazy\u2019 Pei Yunge push her down the stairs. With no other choice, they sent Pei Yunge into the mental hospital.However, they never thought that this was an unethical hospital where the Director of the hospital liked to take advantage of the young female patients.Recalling it all, Pei Yunge could not help but snort.Wow, even this sort of female protagonist could be termed as the \u2018black-lotus-type female protagonist\u2019 that sought revenge for every grievance she had suffered.5\u2026After recalling the entire storyline, Pei Yunge had no choice but to accept reality. However, she wasn\u2019t panicked at all. Instead, her hoarse voice was filled with a prickling coldness. \u201cWere you the one who injured my leg?\u201d3This sudden question made the Director of the hospital freeze for a second, before he sneered.\u201cDid the little b*tch\u2019s brain rot? Do you really think you\u2019re the Qin family\u2019s Eldest Young Miss? Can\u2019t you see what kind of a good you are?!\u201dWith that said, the Director of the hospital was about to pull her towards himself. However, he saw the person in front of him slowly stand up.It was as if she felt no pain at all.\u201cThen you\u2019ll have to compensate me.\u201dPei Yunge\u2019s eyes were bright and colored with charm. Yet, there was a hint of ruthlessness shining within them. This unreadable expression made one\u2019s scalp turn numb even more!The Director of the hospital almost thought he had seen a ghost!This girl in front of him seemed to be a completely different person and wasn\u2019t like that timid and reclusive Pei Yunge at all?!\u201cHave you thought of which one you want to compensate me with?\u201dThe girl\u2019s words were like a talisman that called for death. However, that second allowed the Director of the hospital to regain his senses!What ghost?!A witless young girl\u2019s acting had actually scared him?! Impossible!\u201cYou dare to scare me? Little b*tch, watch how I\u2019ll take care of you!\u201dThe Director of the hospital grew angry from embarrassment as he savagely pounced towards Pei Yunge!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Immediately, a chill appeared in the back of his head!\u201cWhat do you want to do?!\u201dThe Director of the hospital\u2019s face was filled with fear. When he finally regained his senses, he hurriedly took out his cell phone with shaking hands.\u201cDoes the Director want to try and see whether you can run faster than my knife?\u201dOne of Pei Yunge\u2019s knees was slightly arched as she stared at him at eye level. Although her leg was still bleeding, the girl acted like it didn\u2019t concern her at all, as if she was someone who had just climbed up from the depths of hell\u20263The Director of the hospital was already weak all over as he stared at the sharp tip of that dagger. That thing in Pei Yunge\u2019s hand was pointed straight at his throat!\u201cP-Pei Yunge! It\u2019s illegal to commit murder!\u201d3Was he kidding her? Hearing this a**hole talk to her about the law, a derisive scoff flashed in Pei Yunge\u2019s eyes. However, after that, she only chuckled lazily. \u201cBut I\u2019m sick. Remember?\u201d7The moment the Director heard that, he froze from head to toe!\u201cM-Miss Pei! I know my mistake now. Please-\u201dThe Director\u2019s back was drenched in cold sweat. However, before he could finish speaking, a painful howl suddenly left his lips!Barely a moment passed.\u201cI\u2019ve decided. It\u2019ll be your third leg.\u201d6Pei Yunge smirked as her pleasant voice sounded arrogant yet calm, as if she was talking about the weather.5The dagger in her hand was already covered in blood.As for the Director\u2026(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)One of his hands was cupping his crotch painfully as deep crimson spread between his legs until it became a large patch. His fat figure was trembling nonstop.3\u2026It was only after the girl had left that he was able to make a call with trembling hands.\u201cJiaojiao, Pei Yunge is trying to escape! That crazy woman, you must seek revenge for Father!\u201d2Both his eyes were completely red as he gritted his words out, hatred filling him with an intensity like never before!\u2026The hospital was a mess as security officers searched all over.\u201cHave you found her? We can\u2019t let her get away!\u201dNo one expected a young girl to actually mutilate the Director and escape!It was really evil!1\u2026Downstairs.Meanwhile, Pei Yunge, who was avoiding the search party, was currently cupping her wound that had already lost too much blood. Her face was pale as she looked up, only to see the heavy rain.The pallor of her skin made her look incredibly haggard. As she looked down, a soft chuckle left her lips and she wiped the blood away from the dagger heedlessly. Those glistening and charming eyes of hers were filled only with coldness and cruelty.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then I\u2019ll try playing.\u201d1\u2026Suddenly, a howl sounded from somewhere.Pei Yunge turned her head and saw a familiar white figure running happily in the rain.\u201cEr Gou?\u201dThe only \u2018character\u2019 Pei Yunge liked in the novel appeared in her mind and the name left her lips subconsciously. However, she didn\u2019t expect the white figure to really stop!It looked around, as if it was looking for its target, before it pinned its sight on Pei Yunge, who was downstairs.\u201cHowl\u2026\u201d It howled towards the sky in excitement.The moment Pei Yunge heard it, a faint, but ominous feeling sprouted from within her.Indeed!In the next second, she saw that snow white Alaskan Malamute running straight towards her, barking excitedly.4\u201c??!\u201dPei Yunge didn\u2019t even have the time to hide when she was already pounced on. Her body ached all over from the fall.However, a certain creature who didn\u2019t want his bestial life was pressing against her with his drenched body. The pitch black doggy eyes were filled with happiness!This was an Alaskan Malamute that the female side-character, Pei Yunge, had raised for several years. Later, because it bit Qin Youjiao, it was bitten to death.7Recalling it\u2019s tragic fate, Pei Yunge forced down the urge to scold the dog. She still had no suspicions in her mind.\u2026Suddenly, an elated exclamation trailed from not too far away.\u201cMaster Du, I found it! The Alaskan is there!\u201dThe moment Pei Yunge heard the voice, she turned around and saw a group of faint silhouettes standing in the rain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he had walked near enough, Pei Yunge managed to see his appearance properly.His eyebrows and eyes were deep but clear and cold, though with a slight laziness laced in them. His faint-colored eyes exuded an aloofness that pushed people thousands of miles away. Yet, the end of his eyes that curled up was somewhat seductive.However, right in that instance, he was staring straight at her. Then suddenly\u30fc\u201cLook there! She\u2019s over there!\u201dBehind them, several buff men holding onto police batons were running over fiercely.However, when they saw the man standing in front of Pei Yunge, they all stopped unconsciously. Although his expression was impassive, he only had to stand there casually to make others feel a heavy sense of oppression.\u201cSir, this is a patient from our hospital that has acted up. If there\u2019s nothing, I\u2019ll take her away first,\u201d one of the security officers stepped up and said nervously.In response, Pei Yunge retorted, \u201cSir, can you help me and call the police? This hospital is taking advantage of underage patients.\u201d In her recollections, she could not remember anyone called \u2018Master Du\u2019 here.Right at this moment, if the man helped her call the police, it would be the easiest way to solve this mess.However, if they all belonged to the same nest\u2026A hint of darkness flashed across Pei Yunge\u2019s eyes as she tightened her hold on the dagger.\u201cSir, she\u2019s a mentally-ill patient! Don\u2019t listen to her nonsense!\u201dPanic flashed in the security officer\u2019s eyes before he said immediately, \u201cHurry and take her away!\u201dWith that said, Pei Yunge tightened her hold on the dagger even more, waiting for the security officers to approach her. However, a silhouette stood before her suddenly.\u201cSir, you\u2026\u201dThe security officer\u2019s heart tightened, wanting to stop the man, only to be blocked by the assistant standing beside the man.\u2026At this moment, Pei Yunge looked up and accidentally met the man\u2019s completely dark eyes that seemed to bury all of the light.\u201cSir, this hospital\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy are you calling me \u2018Sir\u2019?\u201dHe smiled casually, before he reached his slender and well-defined index finger out and tapped her forehead. His light and magnetic voice was filled with humor.\u201cCome, let me hear you call me \u2018Older Brother\u2019.\u201d(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)Somehow, when said in that deep voice of his, the words \u2018Older Brother\u2019 sounded more like ambiguous flirting.However, the warmth from the index finger on her forehead made Pei Yunge\u2019s brain blank out for a long time, before she finally regained her senses.Did\u2026 Did she get hit on?Pei Yunge wasn\u2019t the only one. Even Huo Shidu\u2019s assistant, Assistant Ceng, kept turning back abruptly, his expression filled with disbelief!Was Master Du being possessed by some kind of god?!For over twenty years he had remained cold and distant to the point of abstinence, yet he was now hitting on a patient in a mental hospital?!However, this girl was way too strange\u2026Her face was covered in flowers and greens. People who didn\u2019t know her might think that she was called Chun\u00a0Tian13Then all of a sudden\u2026\u201cOlder Brother, can you take me away?\u201dThe girl smirked, looking flirtatious, yet her eyes were so clear they could take a soul. As she said this, her hold on the thing in her hand tightened.The man\u2019s faint-colored eyes were dark. His unconcerned eyes still looked inhuman. Before she could react, he suddenly snatched the dagger from her hand.This little thing was absolutely daring.Nervous eyes stared at the man as Pei Yunge considered the man half-crouching before her. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cCeng Xu, call the police,\u201d the man said slowly. Hearing this, the security officers started to panic.\u201cSir, you believe the words of a crazy person?!\u201d\u2026The moment he finished speaking, the ringing of the police siren suddenly sounded from the entrance!\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d Someone burst out, panicked.Didn\u2019t they not call the police yet?!The people from the hospital looked apprehensive, as they instantly fell into a mess!\u201cCeng Xu, bring the dog back.\u201dAssistant Ceng nodded. He was about to pick up the leash when the Alaskan suddenly barked fiercely at him, causing him to halt his actions.\u201cEr Gou, come here.\u201dHearing her voice, the Alaskan obediently went over to rub against her. Its eyes were bright as it laid on her legs, rolling about as it wanted her to rub its stomach.Seeing this, Assistant Ceng instantly understood the situation. It turned out that the Alaskan that Little Young Master found wasn\u2019t a stray, but was this girl\u2019s pet.Pei Yunge suddenly chuckled, smiling brightly and somewhat arrogantly. \u201cOlder Brother, please don\u2019t take the dog.

It was unique and aggressive at the same time.In the next second, before she could react, her world turned 180 degrees before she hit against a warm chest! Through the thin shirt, his hot temperature and heartbeat could make a person blush.Pei Yunge\u2019s expression immediately changed as she hugged the man\u2019s neck unconsciously, afraid of falling off.The man was a little pleased with her reaction.\u2026Time had barely passed when Pei Yunge heard Huo Shidu\u2019s low and magnetic voice that was filled with teasing and ambiguity.\u201cWhat are you afraid of? Older Brother\u2019s waist is really strong.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Her smile was wiped off.From the moment she saw him, she already felt that this man was way too dangerous and hard to approach. However, she never expected this man\u2019s actions to be so hard to predict.\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to go home with Older Brother?\u201dHuo Shidu said calmly as if he was talking about the weather. After signaling Pei Yunge to take the umbrella, he got ready to just carry her away like that.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)This scene made Assistant Ceng and all his bodyguards\u2019 jaws drop to the floor!What was with Master Du?!He really just took her!\u2026However, just as Huo Shidu had arrived at the entrance, they heard someone roaring in anger.\u201cWhere the f*ck is she?! Let me tell you, if my younger sister is missing, all of you can prepare to spend the rest of your lives rotting in prison!\u201d2Hearing the furious voice, Pei Yunge turned around to see Qin Lang\u2019s handsome, yet fierce expression.Just with the man\u2019s silver-ash-colored dyed hair and his outstanding appearance, according to the novel\u2019s description, Pei Yunge managed to guess the man\u2019s identity.It was her third older brother and one of the top gaming players in the nation. He had just gotten the champion in the world\u2019s championship game and had returned proudly with his team.\u2026At this moment, Qin Lang didn\u2019t have time to keep his fierce and cruel expression when he saw his younger sister staring at him with a cold expression.\u201cY-Yun\u2026\u201dQin Lang\u2019s throat was dry. However, before he could finish speaking, a man looking similar to Qin Lang and a pretty girl were walking over from not too far away.Pei Yunge scoffed. \u201cSo everyone that shouldn\u2019t have come is now here?\u201dEveryone?Qin Lang was still completely confused. However, he turned around and saw his eldest brother and Qin Youjiao rush over.\u201cOlder Brother, aren\u2019t you taking me home?\u201dPei Yunge\u2019s red lips curled up as she pressed against Huo Shidu\u2019s ear intimately in front of Qin Lang.Qin Lang, \u201c?!\u201dWhat was this?! This situation was wrong!Shouldn\u2019t the right sequence of this situation be his soft and cute little sister running towards him, asking for hugs?!5Why did such a wild man appear suddenly while carrying his sister? And why was he called \u2018Older Brother\u2019 so sweetly by her?!Why was this sequence different from his previous life?3Did he come too early after he was reborn?9Qin Lang stared at Pei Yunge being carried. His eyes were a little red as he clenched his fists unconsciously.Even he hadn\u2019t carried Ge\u2019er like this before\u20264\u2026However, when Pei Yunge saw Qin Lang\u2019s expression, she thought that he was going to scoff and ridicule her again, so she decided to simply look away and ignore him.Seeing this, Qin Lang felt even more like his world had cracked apart.What was with his Ge\u2019er?!\u201cThird Brother, is Pei Yunge alright?\u201d Suddenly, a coy and clear voice tittered.Almost unconsciously, Pei Yunge furrowed her eyebrows. However, at this moment, she didn\u2019t know what happened to the man carrying her, as he suddenly walked straight out.This also prevented the newcomers from seeing the man properly, not to mention that this was the famous President of the Huo Corporation.\u201cGe\u2026\u201dBefore Qin Lang could speak, Qin Youjiao had grabbed his hand. \u201cThird Brother, forget it.

Third Brother, you\u2019ve only just returned to the country and she\u2019s already worrying all of you so much. Must she fight for attention like this?\u201dSeeing Qin Youjiao\u2019s spoiled expression that was filled with contempt and blatant disregard, Qin Lang\u2019s fists were so tight that his knuckles were white.In his previous life, they, the Qin family, treated Qin Youjiao as their most beloved daughter and cast Ge\u2019er away like she was an old shoe. Later, because they had offended some nameless people, they ended up with a ruined family.6But the truth was that the thing he felt was the most ironic was that Qin Youjiao, whom they had treated like their biological younger sister, actually turned against them and became friends with the enemy. She even made Eldest Brother accept the woman who was the ultimate cause of making the Qin family bankrupt.2On the other hand, Ge\u2019er, who had never received love from them, took on the burden to take care of them without any complaints. That made them regret their actions terribly.Returning back to reality, Qin Lang sucked in a deep breath. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201dQin Youjiao bit her lip. \u201cThird Brother, the Director of this hospital is my biological father after all. I heard that Pei Yunge injured my father.\u201d1With that said, Qin Youjiao thought that Qin Lang would definitely comfort her like in the past and get Eldest Brother to throw Pei Yunge further away.However, right then and there, Qin Lang, who had been reborn, did not want to waste time talking to Qin Youjiao at all. All he was concerned about was that his Ge\u2019er was about to run away with another man.Instead he snapped impatiently, \u201cThen you can go and take care of him!\u201dWhat\u2026? The brusqueness of his response made Qin Youjiao stiffen. She never thought that Qin Lang would speak to her like this.\u201cThird Brother\u2026\u201dQin Youjiao was just about to speak but Qin Lang was already running towards the direction Pei Yunge had left in. However, he never thought that she had already gone!\u2026In the car.\u201cAlas[1.Let\u2019s call him Alas, short for Alaskan Malamute!]!\u201d6The moment Pei Yunge got into the car, her eyes were drawn to an adorable little thing, dressed in a vest and a shirt, who happened to be sitting beside her. The little one\u2019s exquisite eyes and eyebrows were 30% similar to the man sitting opposite of her.\u201cYou can see him for the last time.\u201dHuo Shidu rubbed against the back of his hand casually.\u201cW-What? Why? Wu\u2026 Alas, what happened?!\u201d The adorable little thing\u2019s immediate sobs were filled with softness and cuteness as he hugged the drenched Alas and cried in despair.\u201cLittle Young Master, Alas is this lady\u2019s pet.\u201dSeeing the little young master\u2019s eyes turn red from crying, Assistant Ceng couldn\u2019t help but pipe up. Hearing this, the adorable little thing looked up and stared unblinkingly at Pei Yunge.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)Just as Pei Yunge was guessing if this adorable little thing was this man\u2019s son, he said something shocking once again.\u201cSister, I\u2019ll give Older Brother to you, so don\u2019t take Alas away, alright?\u201d the adorable little thing sniffed as he said so.11Pei Yunge did not know what to say.Were dogs worth so much nowadays?1The atmosphere was still frozen. Even Assistant Ceng could not help but fear if Master Du would throw Little Young Master out of the car directly.The great President of the Huo Corporation was being used in exchange for a pet?!5\u201cSay it once more if you dare.\u201d Huo Shidu narrowed his eyes at the little one lazily.If the Old Madam was not pestering him constantly to find a match, he would not have personally come out to look for a dog.The moment the adorable little thing heard his words, he hugged Alas tightly, looking so downtrodden and pitiful that his eyes turned red.Older Brother really doesn\u2019t love him at all!3\u2026After a while, the adorable little thing saw Pei Yunge from the corner of his eyes and looked up with his small head. \u201cSister, I\u2019ll leave with you then.\u201d6If he did, then he would be where Alas was!1At this moment, before Pei Yunge could speak, they heard the man say calmly, \u201cCeng Xu, stop the car. Carry him back to the Old Manor.\u201dThe adorable little thing was in great disbelief and his cheeks almost puffed up in shock. \u201cOlder Brother, you\u2019re abandoning your benefactor after you\u2019ve achieved your goal!\u201d3The man laughed before he said slowly, \u201cWe\u2019ll add two more lessons of Language classes every week.\u201dPerhaps it was because the adorable little thing looked too pitiful, Pei Yunge raised an eyebrow and rubbed Alas\u2019s head.\u201cAccompany the little kid a little more. I\u2019ll come and get you in a few days.\u201dAlas nuzzled its head against Pei Yunge\u2019s hand sadly, unwilling to part. It then looked at the pitiful adorable little thing, before it followed after the boy.\u2026Not too long later, only two people were left in the car.Pei Yunge heard the man asked slowly, \u201cYou really want to leave with me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, somehow, he really brought her out when he saw her look away coldly and ignore her so-called family.This was an unexpected rashness he rarely had.\u201cIf Older Brother is busy, you can leave me by the road.\u201dAs she said this, Pei Yunge\u2019s eyes were bright and clear. However, she had a feeling that he was a wild and arrogant person. To her, she already owed this man a favor for bringing her out, so she had no hopes for him to accept the trouble that was her.The man\u2019s low and lazy voice was even colder than the trigger sound of the silver lighter in his hand right now. \u201cI still have to take responsibility when a little girl is running away from home.\u201d1Hearing this, Pei Yunge\u2019s heart skipped a beat somehow.1A man like this wasn\u2019t even the male protagonist?Then why could that person called Cheng Zihuai be the male protagonist? Was it because he was crazy enough?At this thought, before Pei Yunge could regain her senses, her body was suddenly lifted off the ground. She was being carried again!Instinctively, Pei Yunge wrapped her arms around the man\u2019s neck again as her expression remained unhappy. Especially after she saw the pleased curl on the man\u2019s lips.In response, she gave a bright generous smile. \u201cOlder Brother\u2019s relationships must be very quick, right?\u201dIt was clear that she was implying that Huo Shidu must have been dumped very quickly during his relationships.However, the man\u2019s next words made one\u2019s heart thump and blush as his unconcerned and lazy demeanor appeared even more sexy.\u201cOther men might be very quick, but Older Brother is only swift and strong.\u201d13Pei Yunge was speechless.1\u2026A Presidential Suite in a hotel.Pei Yunge was placed on the sofa by the man.However, when Pei Yunge was looking around her, she saw a bed not too far away and a heart shape made from rose petals.\u201cChange into this first.\u201dHuo Shidu walked over and threw the clothing at Pei Yunge casually before he took a seat at the side.However, when he turned around, he found Pei Yunge staring at the bathrobe in her hands. After a few seconds, she stared at him with a complicated expression.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)Seeing this, the man couldn\u2019t help but chuckle lowly, before he slowly approached her.His low and magnetic voice seemed to have a temperature that could scorch someone. \u201cLittle one, if I was a bad person, you wouldn\u2019t be sitting on the sofa but on Older Brother\u2019s lap instead.\u201dWith that said, he was about to make a call to the hotel concierge to handle the situation. However, a knock suddenly sounded from the door.\u201cMaster Du? Old Madam Huo said that you haven\u2019t had dinner yet and got me to bring some food to you.\u201dHearing this, even Pei Yunge raised an eyebrow.Was it possible for a hotel of such high caliber to not provide dinner services?It was obvious there was a hidden agenda.1\u201cDo you need me to go to the washroom?\u201d Pei Yunge was very tactful. After all, it was the heart and concern of an elder.However, Huo Shidu turned towards her instead with a half-smirk.\u201cIf you were a little younger, perhaps, you can be Older Brother\u2019s daughter.\u201dWhat? Pei Yunge\u2019s eyelids twitched.This man was only five years older than her at most!From the corner of his eye, Huo Shidu noticed that her clothes were drenched. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go and shower?\u201dSeeing that she was a little dirty, Pei Yunge assumed that Huo Shidu thought she was dirty.\u201cAlright.\u201d She nodded and slowly walked into the bathroom.2\u201cMaster Du, are you there?\u201dHearing the persistent knocking from the door, the man took out a cigarette from the cigarette box instead.2Within moments, white smoke surrounded him. His thin lips were pressed on the cigarette as he leaned against the sofa indolently. His eyes looked slightly aloof and void of any emotions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her beautiful eyebrows and eyes seemed to exude a natural wildness and arrogance, yet, those same eyes were naturally beautiful and clear.It made Huo Shidu think that as long as she acted obedient, no one could bring themselves to scold her if she did anything bad.\u201cAre you going to wash up?\u201dAs she said this, Pei Yunge had been drying her hair. She was rather satisfied with her appearance. When she turned around, she noticed that the man\u2019s pants were wet from the rain as well.\u201cMm.\u201dHuo Shidu looked away and hummed lowly in reply. \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone in. A female staff member will come over in a while.\u201dPei Yunge glanced at him once more. \u201cAlright. Thank you.\u201dBefore she had been reborn, there were several great family heirs that didn\u2019t lust after women around her as well. However, none rejected a woman as straightforwardly as Huo Shidu did.Perhaps he had suffered from a heartbreak before?Impossible.Almost immediately, Pei Yunge dismissed this thought.Even a person like her whom others have said was picky thought that this man was right up her alley. His appearance matched her sense of beauty perfectly.\u2026After that, before Pei Yunge had time to think about it, a knock suddenly came from the door.When she turned around, she saw a female staff member walking in. Behind her was a woman wearing thin stilettos and was dressed prettily in a hip-hugging skirt.\u201cMiss, I\u2019ll head out first then\u2026\u201dThe staff avoided all eye contact and placed the clothes randomly on the table before she walked out.Right after the door closed, Pei Yunge heard the woman\u2019s unfriendly words. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dPei Yunge\u2019s side profile and pretty features appeared in the woman\u2019s sight. She was even exuding a lack of care that came after a certain scenario.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)The woman clenched her fists tightly.Didn\u2019t they say that Master Du avoided women?!Then what was with this woman?!To think that she was still extremely elated when Old Madam Huo picked her from the group of young ladies!A fire burned within her as she felt affronted that this Pei Yunge had snatched her win!\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201dThe woman suppressed her anger. If she wasn\u2019t afraid that Huo Shidu might appear anytime, she would definitely slap this woman several times!\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d Pei Yunge closed her eyes lazily, not wanting to speak more. However, her expression appeared to be a silent flaunting to the other woman. Especially when they were in this kind of situation.Meanwhile, the girl was leaning against the sofa. Her face was still a little pale, making her look a little sick, as if she had been bullied terribly.\u201cShameless!\u201dThe woman gritted her teeth. After calming herself down, she smiled superficially. \u201cLittle girl, do you know how old you are? That is Sister\u2019s boyfriend. Your behavior of sleeping with someone else\u2019s boyfriend\u2026\u201dBefore she could finish speaking, Pei Yunge opened her eyes and stared at her. If she didn\u2019t hear clearly earlier, she might really have believed this woman.\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cDo you know what type men like? There\u2019s a huge difference between a woman and a girl.\u201dAs she said this, she took out a few hundred dollar bills and smiled, \u201cDu\u2026 He\u2019s only hankering after something new. Little girl, you\u2026\u201dBefore the woman finished speaking, she saw the person sitting on the sofa stand up.Instead of bothering to respond, Pei Yunge didn\u2019t look at her and started to undo her bathrobe. Within seconds, the bathrobe fell on the floor. Her voluminous figure seemed to make the woman\u2019s face burn fiercely as if she had been slapped!She tightly clenched onto the money she wanted to use to humiliate Pei Yunge with.A soft smile appeared on Pei Yunge\u2019s face as her pretty eyes curled up as she said slowly, \u201cOlder brothers now sure are good.\u201d\u201cYou\u30fc\u201dThe woman glared at her with red eyes as she stared as Pei Yunge changed her clothes calmly.

You\u2019re still not leaving? Are you planning to stay and strip?\u201d Pei Yunge smirked with interest.The woman bit her lip before she left in a huff!How humiliating! It was not that she didn\u2019t dare, but that with such a comparison, she would really be embarrassing herself if she did strip!After the woman left, Pei Yunge was done changing her clothes and was slowly applying the red medicine.\u2026After a few minutes, Huo Shidu walked out and smelt the nauseating smell of perfume.\u201cDid someone come?\u201d His eyes darkened.\u201cShe already left.\u201dPei Yunge was done cleaning her wound and she smirked neither too quickly nor too slowly. \u201cHowever, Older Brother might have some explaining to do when you return.\u201dSeeing the way she bandaged her wound to be a little weird, Huo Shidu simply walked towards her. Lowering his status for the first time, he helped her bandage it instead.\u201cI can\u2019t count on you to be good.\u201dThe little girl\u2019s appearance was already wild enough.\u201c\u2026\u201dPei Yunge suddenly felt that she should have told that woman earlier that the bathroom did not have a lock.5\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201dIt seemed Huo Shidu was extremely skillful in bandaging a wound. Within moments, her wound was wrapped unexpectedly well.\u201cPei Yunge.\u201dHearing this, the man smirked as his eyes exuded some degrees of carelessness.\u201cI\u2019m Huo Shidu. I will leave my phone number for you. Rest early.\u201d1\u2026It was a night of light slumber.Pei Yunge saw a piece of paper pressed on the coffee table. The handwriting was strong and forceful. There were a few hundred dollar bills under the note as well.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)Now, she didn\u2019t only owe the man a favor. She owed him money too.At the thought of her current circumstance, her eyebrows furrowed. There was some difficulty in repaying this favor.After leaving the hotel, even though Pei Yunge didn\u2019t like the Qin family, she still took a taxi back.\u2026The Qin family villa.On the sofa, a handsome young man dressed in a simple white t-shirt was smoking impatiently.His expression was vexed.He actually let Ge\u2019er leave with another person while he was talking to Qin Youjiao! F*ck!However, in their previous life, this hospital was only exposed when a big-shot\u2019s daughter passed away in it. And when Ge\u2019er finally left the hospital, she had already been tortured till the point that she was no longer in shape and had a strange personality.At this thought, Qin Lang remembered all too clearly how Ge\u2019er had declared \u2018I don\u2019t want to be siblings with all of you anymore in my next life\u2019. Those anguished words from before he was reborn\u2026 his hands started to shake violently.4The cigarette ash burning him got him flustered and he looked up instinctively. He never thought his eyes would meet with Pei Yunge\u2019s as she walked in.Compared to the weird dressing and makeup she had in the past, today\u2019s Pei Yunge\u2019s red dress, black hair and fair skin made her look incredibly beautiful.Especially her eyes. They were slightly red, as if she was up all night. Yet, they were still terribly attractive.Qin Lang clenched his fists tightly as his eyes watered. He almost forgot how beautiful his Ge\u2019er was.Before his bankruptcy, he knew nothing about Ge\u2019er. After he was bankrupt, he knew that Ge\u2019er was beautiful, but he couldn\u2019t even afford to buy a single lipstick for her. He could only watch her work three jobs a day as she wore battered rags.4\u201cGe\u2026\u201d\u201cBrother! My piano room is too sunny. Don\u2019t you remember that you agreed to let Pei Yunge change her bedroom with mine? It\u2019s the same anyway right?\u201dQin Youjiao\u2019s expression was spoiled and arrogant as she interrupted Qin Lang\u2019s words with a bright smile and whined coyly while hugging his arm.2Instantly, Qin Lang\u2019s handsome face froze.Sh*t! He actually did agree to do such an animalistic thing!However, before he could speak, he saw Pei Yunge\u2019s red lips curl up.\u201cSure, do whatever you want. I\u2019m preparing to stay in school anyway.\u201d1With that said, Qin Youjiao finally took in the sight of the other person beside them. However, when she caught a clear glimpse of Pei Yunge\u2019s appearance, her eyes widened with a glare!This woman was Pei Yunge?!Impossible! How could she look like this?!\u201cCan you get used to staying in school?\u201d1Qin Lang\u2019s throat was dry as he asked slightly awkwardly.Hearing this, even Qin Youjiao froze. Didn\u2019t Third Brother hate Pei Yunge the most and found her annoying?Or did Third Brother think that it would be more annoying if Pei Yunge moved back and forth because she can\u2019t get used to staying in school?At this thought, Qin Youjiao\u2019s expression became slightly better.\u201cThird Brother, Pei Yunge isn\u2019t that delicate.\u201d1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He could sense that his Ge\u2019er had started to ignore him after she left the hospital\u20261Pursing his lips, Qin Lang was about to go upstairs when he was pulled back.\u201cThird Brother, what are you doing?\u201d1Qin Youjiao felt a little uneasy. There was a niggling feeling in the back of her mind that Third Brother and Eldest Brother were a little weird recently and had been really cold to her.Was she imagining things? In the past, only she would be the one to ignore them and it would always be them coming to humor her.\u201cHelping Ge\u2019er get ready.\u201dQin Lang furrowed his eyebrows and pulled Qin Youjiao\u2019s hand away from his arm.Seeing his cold expression and his reluctance to touch her, Qin Youjiao\u2019s mind started to spin into a mess. She only felt a suffocating grievance and she bit back the pout that was threatening to appear on her face.Since when did Third Brother care for Pei Yunge?! Third Brother was the one who said that she was the most important youngest sister in his heart!\u201cThird Brother, who is more important? Pei Yunge or me?!\u201dIn the past, Qin Youjiao had always acted coyly by peering them with these kinds of unreasonable questions. If it was the him from before, Qin Lang would humor her immediately. However, right now, it was as if he had heard something ridiculous and Qin Lang only snorted in response.\u201cShe\u2019s my biological younger sister.\u201d1What?\u00a0Like a thousand pounds had dropped onto her from the ceiling, these words fell on her so hard that she instantly woke up. She found it incredible and hard to believe at the same time.What did Third Brother mean?!Why was he acting like this suddenly? Did Third Brother find out that she had faked her fall on purpose that time?No, this must be related to Pei Yunge!A glint of iciness flashed in Qin Youjiao\u2019s eyes. However, on the surface, she stopped Qin Lang once more.\u201cThird Brother, let me go to help her instead. It\u2019s not appropriate to go into a girl\u2019s room anyhow.\u201dPerhaps, at the thought of Pei Yunge\u2019s attitude towards him right now, Qin Lang hesitated.1Seeing this, Qin Youjiao bit her lip as she covered up her unhappy ruthlessness and quickly went upstairs.This Pei Yunge must have done something!\u2026(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)The second floor.Pei Yunge pushed open the door to her room. The dust inside was heavy and thick, making it hard to breathe. In fact, she could even smell the stench of garlic water.Seeing the amulets around the room, her eyes filled with contempt.Just because Qin Youjiao randomly said to the servants that Pei Yunge had been possessed, they stuck these ridiculous things all over her room and sprayed garlic water every day in order to please Qin Youjiao. They completely disregarded how the original her would break down when she saw her room in such a state.Narrowing her eyes, Pei Yunge found her school uniform after turning on the lights.\u201cPei Yunge, it seems like you don\u2019t remember the pain at all.\u201dSince Qin Lang wasn\u2019t around, Qin Youjiao couldn\u2019t be bothered putting on her act. She had her hands on her hips as she raised an eyebrow and smirked coldly.\u201cDo you think that you can change our brothers\u2019 attitudes towards you just by staying at the Qin family residence? Are you still dreaming?\u201dWho knew that unlike before, Pei Yunge simply pursed her lips and remained silent. Her eyes were filled with charm as she slowly asked in return, \u201cHmm, is that so? Then what are you afraid of?\u201d\u201cShut up! You\u2019re saying nonsense!\u201dHaving been seen through, Qin Youjiao\u2019s eyes turned cold before she gritted her teeth.She approached Pei Yunge and said mockingly, \u201cIf I can make our elder brothers send you to the mental hospital once, it can happen for the second time! In their hearts, you can\u2019t even compare to a strand of my hair. Even if I framed you purposefully, you can\u2019t\u30fc\u201d\u201cAh. I almost forgot that I hadn\u2019t calculated this issue with you.\u201d Before Qin Youjiao finished speaking, Pei Yunge suddenly interrupted her.\u201cW-What?\u201dQin Youjiao watched as Pei Yunge looked up. Somehow, her pair of sparkling eyes was exuding a frightening coldness as she licked her lips and smirked. \u201cDid you forget the reason I was sent in for?\u201dPanic arose in her and Qin Youjiao flinched and stepped back instinctively. However, Pei Yunge grabbed her hand faster than she could step back.\u201cIf you dare touch me, Third Brother will throw you out of the Qin family!\u201d\u201cOh? That sounds rather\u2026 appealing.\u201d2Then\u30fcWith a loud thud, Qin Youjiao was suddenly thrown to the side by a strong force and her body slammed against a wall.

She was being dragged unceremoniously by Pei Yunge from the start to the end!\u201cThird Brother, save me! Pei Yunge is crazy!\u201dQin Youjiao\u2019s haggard screams attracted even the servants in the courtyard. And when Qin Lang, who had been outside, heard the screams, his handsome face turned cold and he walked into the living room.\u201cPei Yunge, what are you doing?! Aren\u2019t you going to let go of Elder Young Miss?! How can you be such an ungrateful and vicious person!!\u201dWhen a fat, middle-aged maid saw Qin Lang walk in with a cold expression, she instantly pointed at Pei Yunge and scolded her loudly.But all Pei Yunge did was smirk.What a pity\u2026 This female protagonist isn\u2019t that capable either.Last night, she had a dream. She dreamed of the life of the original Pei Yunge from when she could remember anything, until her terrible death a few years later. Even a person like her, who never had any sympathy for others, could feel the suppression and tragic despair of the original Pei Yunge.With a curl of her finger, Pei Yunge held onto Qin Youjiao\u2019s chin, as each of her words made one\u2019s flesh creep.\u201cDon\u2019t even talk about how I can dare to push you. If I\u2019m not happy, I can even bury you alive.\u201dWith that said, Qin Youjiao had just screamed when someone suddenly kicked the back of her knees! Then she tumbled down the stairs from the second level!4The servants of the family all widened their eyes at the sight before them.Was that Pei Yunge?Since when was this useless thing so daring?! She even dared to do anything in front of them!\u201cIt hurts, Third Brother\u2026\u201dQin Youjiao laid on the floor, her face terribly pale as her eyebrows were furrowed together.After regaining her senses, a bright glimmer flashed in Aunt Huang\u2019s eyes, before she said ruthlessly, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you catching this b*tch yet?!\u201d1As long as they managed to chase Pei Yunge, the b*stard child, out, Elder Young Lady would definitely remember her goodness and stop annoying the young masters.1At this thought, Aunt Huang wriggled her plump figure and ran in front of Pei Yunge. She raised her hand, wanting to slap Pei Yunge.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)However, she never thought that her hand would be caught easily by that fair and slender hand.What?!\u00a0Aunt Huang panicked. However, her eyes happened to meet with Pei Yunge\u2019s dark and glimmering eyes, and fell upon the smirk on her lips.Why did this useless b*stard child seem like she was a completely different person?When did her gaze become so scary?!\u201d\u201cYou little b*tch, if you don\u2019t let go of me, watch how I\u2019ll tear your vixen face apart!\u201dThe moment she finished speaking, everyone heard a crisp slap.They all stared at their Second Young Lady in disbelief. She was usually quiet and obedient and didn\u2019t even dare to lift her head.Everyone knew that Aunt Huang\u2019s shrewd character was hard to deal with. Together with the fact that Aunt Huang had taken care of Qin Youjiao for many years, she was considered to be one of the more influential servants in the Qin family.If anyone dared to offend her, they would definitely receive revenge behind their backs!In the past, apart from the Qin brothers, Pei Yunge was probably the most afraid of Aunt Huang!Yet, she actually slapped Aunt Huang today?!Everyone was still dazed when they heard Pei Yunge\u2019s indolent yet charismatic tone. \u201cDid you forget what your status is? Is it your place to act shrewd?\u201dIn that moment, the air around them couldn\u2019t help but freeze. However, very soon, Qin Lang\u2019s voice started, \u201cGe\u2019er, you\u2026\u201d\u201cThird Brother, my hand hurts.\u201d Qin Youjiao interrupted Qin Lang\u2019s words.1Hearing the simpering voice, Qin Lang turned around and noticed that Qin Youjiao was still lying on the floor. It was only then that he realized he had to settle Qin Youjiao first.1\u201cWhat are all of you dazing out for? Quickly bring her upstairs and call a doctor over!\u201dQin Lang\u2019s expression darkened.If anything happened to Qin Youjiao, she would probably find another excuse to frame Ge\u2019er!However, when Qin Youjiao heard his words, she let out a hidden sigh of relief, before she glanced smugly at Pei Yunge.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The servants helped Qin Youjiao upstairs very quickly.

Third Brother must have wanted to stay to punish Pei Yunge and avenge her!Sweetness filled Qin Youjiao\u2019s heart.Indeed, Third Brother treated her the best!After Qin Youjiao went upstairs, the scene in the living room became a different one.\u201cAiyo, Young Master, this crazy lunatic is going to break this old lady\u2019s hand!\u201d Aunt Huang howled, purposefully acting as if she was being abused by Pei Yunge. Seeing this, Pei Yunge licked her smirking lips.In the next second, Aunt Huang\u2019s terrible cry almost made one\u2019s scalp turn numb.Following the ear-splitting shriek, the teenage girl\u2019s voice slowly enunciated every word. \u201cIsn\u2019t it simple if you want to break your hand?\u201dChills suddenly ran up everyone else\u2019s spines!What was with this Second Young Miss? Was she really possessed? Why was she acting like a demon incarnate?\u201cYoung Master, save me!

This was his biological young sister!Even in his previous life, Ge\u2019er\u2019s personality had changed after spending time in the mental hospital. However, she was completely different from the Ge\u2019er in front of him now!(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)\u201cAunt Huang, what did you call Ge\u2019er?\u201dAnger and ruthlessness flashed in Qin Lang\u2019s eyes.Did they step on Ge\u2019er like this in the past as well?At the thought of how well Aunt Huang treated Qin Youjiao, Qin Lang only wanted to laugh bitterly. Were they brainwashed to the extent that they had forgotten who the actual Qin Elder Young Miss was?1Stiffening, Aunt Huang froze, not expecting that Qin Lang would ask what he did.\u201cYoung Master, she was the one who pushed Elder Young Miss down the stairs, we all saw it!

Whenever any of the brothers said mean things to Pei Yunge to stand up for Qin Youjiao, he would punish them with the family rules and even Qin Youjiao wouldn\u2019t be able to step into the old mansion at all.1However, the Old Master would pass away from a terrible condition a year from now.Qin Lang felt his eyes water a little as he didn\u2019t want to explain anymore. His only wish was that Pei Yunge wouldn\u2019t leave. \u201cIs it because of them that you don\u2019t want to stay?\u201d2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How about you wait a little longer?\u201dPei Yunge furrowed her eyebrows.What Qin Lang said was true, but she did not want to stay at the Qin family either.Seeing that Pei Yunge was silent, Qin Lang\u2019s eyes brightened up. Then he said with a pitiful tone, \u201cBesides, it\u2019ll be Grandpa\u2019s birthday soon. How about you wait until Grandpa\u2019s birthday is over\u2026\u201dEveryone else who saw Qin Lang acting like this was in disbelief!Was Third Young Master\u2026 pleading with Pei Yunge?! They never saw him doing anything of the sort towards Elder Young Miss like this before!On the side, Aunt Huang, whose hand was almost snapped, was in a daze from seeing what had happened! She hurriedly said, \u201cThird Young Master, just now, this luna\u2026 Pei Yunge almost killed Elder Young Miss. How could y\u30fc\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dQin Lang\u2019s eyes were filled with a biting coldness as he thundered, \u201cButler, write Aunt Huang a cheque with three months of her pay. She is to leave the Qin family!\u201d1The butler regained his senses and replied quickly, \u201cYes.\u201dHowever, everyone else felt a chill run up their spines.You had to know that Aunt Huang relied on the fact that she was Qin Youjiao\u2019s babysitter in the past, so the three young masters had always given her some face in the past. However, right now, Third Young Master didn\u2019t say anything and fired her straight away!And it was because of Pei Yunge?!And in that moment, Aunt Huang\u2019s eyes also widened. her voice was panicked and sharp. \u201cThird Young Master, I\u2019m helping Elder Young Miss! Don\u2019t you dote on Elder Young Miss the most?! This woman is just an outsider\u30fc\u201d\u201cJust who is an outsider?\u201d1Qin Lang interrupted her as his expression fell. \u201cGe\u2019er is my biological younger sister and is the Qin family\u2019s true Elder Young Miss! The Qin family doesn\u2019t need a servant that shows attitude to their masters!\u201d(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)Hearing this, every servant that had bullied Pei Yunge in the past couldn\u2019t help but shiver slightly.What was going on?A while back, the young masters had even sent Pei Yunge to the mental hospital because Qin Youjiao was pushed down the stairs! However, now that things had happened again, the one that was punished was Pei Yunge\u2019s close aide?2Wasn\u2019t this slapping Qin Youjiao in the face?!\u201cThird Young Master\u2026\u201dAunt Huang\u2019s expression fell sorrowfully as the panic started to overwhelm her.\u201cButler, call the security officers over. Now.\u201dQin Lang didn\u2019t even spare her another glance, simply turning towards Pei Yunge as his attitude changed completely.\u201cGe\u2019er, the second floor is too noisy. There\u2019s still an empty room beside Third Brother on the third floor. How about you stay beside Third Brother?\u201dIn fact, Qin Lang simply didn\u2019t want Qin Youjiao to approach Pei Yunge again, just in case she was being mean to his Ge\u2019er. Besides, if Ge\u2019er stayed in the room beside his, they could mend their relationship faster.1Pei Yunge didn\u2019t even notice Qin Lang\u2019s careful and nervous expression as she looked up a little.\u201cMm.\u201dShe had just taken over this body, so it was true that she didn\u2019t have the ability to leave. She could only wait till the approval of her application to stay in school, then return them her accommodation fee before moving far away from the Qin family.As for the rest of the people present, none of them dared to believe what they were seeing was real!In the past, Qin Youjiao had asked for the room on the third floor as well because the room had great lighting. However, Qin Lang rejected the request every time by avoiding the topic.Yet, he was giving it to Pei Yunge now?!There was even a sense of hoodwinking. Alarm bells rung in the servants\u2019 hearts, realizing that the statuses in the Qin family would probably change from then on\u2026\u2026Qin Lang followed Pei Yunge upstairs. However, after he walked into Pei Yunge\u2019s room for the first time, the bright smile on his lips disappeared in an instant.Ge\u2019er\u2026 She lived in such a place?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, he never expected their lack of concern for Ge\u2019er would result in Ge\u2019er having to face such treatment.\u201cI don\u2019t have much. We can move everything in three trips.\u201dWith that said, Qin Lang instantly moved forward and helped Pei Yunge move her heavy items without another word.\u2026Seeing this, Pei Yunge furrowed her eyebrows, feeling that there was something wrong with Qin Lang. However, she didn\u2019t say anything either and simply started to pack all of her necessities.In a bedroom on the second floor.Qin Youjiao had just finished applying the medicine and her mood was terrible. \u201cCall Aunt Huang over.\u201d\u201cElder Young Miss, Aunt Huang, she\u2026\u201dThe maid\u2019s expression was scared and timid. \u201cShe was chased away by Third Young Master.\u201dHearing this, Qin Youjiao\u2019s voice raised to a screech!\u201cWhat did you say? How could this be?!\u201d\u201cA-Aunt Huang said that Second Young Miss is a lunatic in Third Young Master\u2019s face.\u201d The servant bowed her head down as she stammered, scared that Qin Youjiao would vent her anger on her.And indeed, when Qin Youjiao heard the servant\u2019s words, her expression darkened speedily.However, amongst her anger, there was more fear and panic.Why would Third Brother suddenly care for Pei Yunge?Not only that, he even fired Aunt Huang for Pei Yunge. Wasn\u2019t he indirectly slapping her in the face?!\u201cE-Elder Young Miss, perhaps Third Young Master is only being nice to Second Young Miss because of Old Master. Old Master\u2019s chronic condition has worsened this year, so Third Young Master can\u2019t keep fighting with Old Master for your sake like he did in the past\u2026\u201dThese words made Qin Youjiao\u2019s expression relax a little.Ah, that was right. She had almost forgotten that there was something like this.\u201cThe Old Master only cares about the bloodlines. It\u2019s no use no matter how well I treat him,\u201d Qin Youjiao said unhappily.From the outside, she was the dazzling and beautiful Qin Elder Young Miss and was doted on by three older brothers. However, the truth was that the Old Master never brought her along to attend any meetings with his closer associates and friends.A strange spark flashed in the servant\u2019s eyes, before she hurriedly bowed down and said, \u201cThat\u2019s why Elder Young Miss has to shine and overshadow everyone during Old Master\u2019s birthday banquet. It is your best chance to garner a good impression! You also know how much Second Young Miss has.\u201d(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)2Hearing this, Qin Youjiao\u2019s eyes instantly lit up as the corners of her lips curled up.Right.She almost forgot that Pei Yunge was a useless thing that couldn\u2019t be helped. She could find some trouble for Pei Yunge anyhow, and the other wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it.However, Third Brother\u2019s attitude towards her today really made her feel uneasy\u2026Qin Youjiao instantly dismissed these thoughts.It was impossible. Pei Yunge would only embarrass the brothers in the Qin family. How could she fight for love with her? She was overthinking things.2\u2026Not too long later, after they were done moving her belongings, Pei Yunge glanced around the wide and bright room before she glanced towards the panting Qin Lang. Her voice was distant. \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cGe\u2019er, are you hungry? How about\u2026\u201d\u201cNo need. I want to rest.\u201d Pei Yunge\u2019s red lips curled up, but the smile did not reach her eyes.After a few seconds, Qin Lang nodded stiffly. \u201cAlright, then you should rest first.\u201dUpon leaving the third floor, the servants came to ask him, \u201cThird Young Master, what would you like to eat for dinner tonight?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll follow Ge\u2019er\u2019s preferences,\u201d Qin Lang said casually.Hearing his words, the servant blanked out for a long time, before the atmosphere turned awkward.\u201cSecond Young Miss doesn\u2019t seem to have any special preferences, right? Anything should do\u2026\u201dIn fact, they had never asked Pei Yunge what she liked to eat. After all, Pei Yunge was not doted on or loved in the Qin family. Who would curry favor with a young lady that had no status?All along, they had been cooking according to the preferences and taste of the Elder Young Miss.However, the moment Qin Lang heard her words, his expression darkened instantly. He remembered the ridiculous things he saw in Pei Yunge\u2019s bedroom and an indiscernible flash crossed his eyes.He laughed coldly. \u201cIs it that Ge\u2019er has nothing she liked to eat, or that you didn\u2019t treat her as the Qin family young lady to begin with?\u201dInstantly, the servant who made the remark panicked!1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yet, you remember Qin Youjiao?\u201d2His words made the servant completely speechless as her face flushed red.What was up with Third Young Master today?Why was he suddenly so concerned about Pei Yunge? Wasn\u2019t Third Young Master the most annoyed at Pei Yunge in the past?\u201cFrom now on, if I find anyone that dismisses or ignores Ge\u2019er, every single one will be thrown out of the Qin family!\u201d Qin Lang said coldly and fiercely.The servant shivered from fear as she hurriedly replied, \u201cThird Young Master, I know my mistake now! I\u2019ll go and ask Second Young Miss what she likes to eat immediately.\u201d\u201cWait.\u201dWhen Qin Lang spoke, his face was void of any emotions. \u201cHave the butler come here now.\u201dThe servant instantly realized that this was probably related to Pei Yunge.\u2026In the evening, an endless number of servants kept knocking at Pei Yunge\u2019s door. Each of them wore bright and flattering smiles as they asked her this and that.However, Pei Yunge got extremely impatient with their questions and simply locked all of them out of her room. Her reaction made the servants alarmed and fearful.Earlier, they felt that Third Young Master was acting strangely, but now, they realized that this Second Young Miss had become even weirder.However, they were forced to keep their resentment to themselves, not daring to voice their unhappiness.Wasn\u2019t she like this just because Third Young Master suddenly changed his attitude now?! Once Third Young Master started ignoring her again, let\u2019s see how arrogant she could be!By the time the evening came, Qin Lang was the one who came and knocked at her door.\u201cGe\u2019er, let\u2019s go outside and have a meal.\u201d He coughed lightly.

He didn\u2019t call Qin Youjiao earlier and had only told the butler to get his car.He only planned to bring Ge\u2019er out with him.Pei Yunge\u2019s eyes crinkled into a knowing look. \u201cYou two can go first. I still need to change, so you can just send me the address.\u201dWith that said, Pei Yunge returned to her room.Qin Lang\u2019s handsome expression darkened, knowing very well that Pei Yunge didn\u2019t want to go with them.\u201cThird Brother, then let\u2019s go.\u201dQin Youjiao took a step forward, wrapping her hand around Qin Lang\u2019s arm. Although Qin Lang remained silent, he threw Qin Youjiao\u2019s hands away from his arm and stalked forward.\u201cHow\u2019s your father?\u201d1Hearing this, a glint of despise flashed in Qin Youjiao\u2019s eyes.However, she bit her lip, acting as if her heart was aching for the mentioned. \u201cPei Yunge incapacitated that area of my father. No matter what, he\u2019s still my father after all\u2026\u201d1Qin Lang snorted.\u201cSo what? I will not spare him from any of the procedures that he is required to go through.\u201dQin Youjiao\u2019s face paled.From Third Brother\u2019s words, didn\u2019t that mean he wanted her father to be in jail\u2026?4\u2026After Pei Yunge slowly changed her clothes, she found a driver waiting for her at the door. There was no reason to reject the offer, so she got into the car straight away.However, when the car was driving past the last junction, it suddenly stopped.\u201cYoung Miss, I\u2019m sorry. There\u2019s an old lady in front of the car,\u201d the driver said nervously.When Pei Yunge looked up, she saw an old lady sitting on the ground. With a hand on her leg, she acted as if she was injured.\u201cWe\u2019re almost there. You can return.\u201dAfter Pei Yunge got out of the car, she walked towards the old lady. Her eyes were filled with amusement.\u201cOld Madam, do you want to go to the hospital?\u201dThis old lady\u2019s dressing wasn\u2019t too normal, so it didn\u2019t seem like she was trying to cheat people of money.

What do you think, girl?\u201d10What in the world?

Her eyes were so clear it was captivating. \u201cOld Madam, he\u2019s working to support me.\u201dEven now, the old lady refused to let Pei Yunge go, so she had no choice but to take the old lady to a caf\u00e9.While the old lady was promoting her grandson, Pei Yunge\u2019s wandering eyes caught a glimpse of a figure at the door.She suddenly stood up. \u201cOld Madam, sit down first. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\u201cWait a minute. I haven\u2019t shown you a picture of my grandson yet!\u201dThe old lady had just clicked on the photo gallery when she saw Pei Yunge walking out.\u2026At the door.The little fellow, who was dressed like a prince, was sucking on a candy and counting the cars passing by. Feeling the movement behind him, the little boy turned his head and his eyes lit up when he saw who was behind him!\u201cSister!\u201d\u201cLittle darling, you\u2019re alone? Is your brother here?\u201dThe little boy unconsciously glanced at the restaurant not far away, before shaking his head vigorously.No, he did not have a brother anymore.4Hearing this, Pei Yunge smiled even more charmingly. She bent down and coaxed him, \u201cCome, follow me.\u201dAfter the little boy left with Pei Yunge, the man, who had just finished a phone call with the Old Madam, returned to the place where the little boy had just stood.\u201cCeng Xu, where\u2019s Xiaomo?\u201dHearing the man\u2019s cold tone, Assistant Ceng shivered. \u201cLittle Young Master didn\u2019t allow me to follow him just now.\u201d\u2026In the caf\u00e9.Just when the old lady was worried that Pei Yunge had run away, she saw that figure coming back.

Pei Yunge interrupted her before she could finish her words. She smiled brightly and crouched down, kissing the little boy.\u201cHe\u2019s my son.\u201dA blush immediately appeared on the little boy\u2019s fair and tender face after being kissed, and he became shy! He also did not care what Pei Yunge was talking about.\u201cYou\u2019re so young and you have a son already??\u201dThe old lady\u2019s voice could not stop raising and she sized up the little fellow. It was obvious that she was suspicious. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he look like you?\u201d\u201cHe looks like his father.\u201dPei Yunge sat on the sofa and said calmly with her lips lifted slightly. The old lady was still doubting whether Pei Yunge was lying to her when she heard her words.Her doubts did not last long.The little boy beside Pei Yunge said in a soft voice, \u201cMommy, I want to go home.\u201dRaising her eyebrow, Pei Yunge patted his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll go home after we send Grandma back, okay?\u201dThen Pei Yunge ordered dessert for the little boy. But she could not help wondering who brought the little boy out? He was just left out on the road with no adults with him.At this moment.A trace of sharpness flashed past the old lady\u2019s eyes. She was about to speak but suddenly stopped.\u201cIf this little fellow is your child, then\u2026\u201d2\u201cHm?\u201dPei Yunge turned her head to look at the old lady.She saw the old lady staring dazedly at a distance not far away, and then subconsciously looking at the little boy beside Pei Yunge.Then she mumbled, \u201cThey really do look alike.\u201dPei Yunge\u2019s body froze and she had a bad feeling.The old lady then exclaimed, \u201cBut, this child\u2019s father is really too perfect. Young people sure know how to take advantage of opportunities!\u201d4When she heard the old lady\u2019s words, Pei Yunge turned around immediately. She saw the man whose expression was cold, striding towards her.

He moved to Huo Shidu\u2019s side and perked up. \u201cBrother, do you think that Sister is good looking?\u201dHearing this, Huo Shidu glanced at him before he leaned back lazily. \u201cDoes it have anything to do with you if she is good looking?\u201d\u201cIf Brother can bring Sister home, then I\u2019ll be able to see her forever.\u201d1Huo Shidu sneered. \u201cStop dreaming.\u201dThis child did not know what abducting girls was.\u201cBut Brother doesn\u2019t have any girlfriend anyway!\u201dThe little fellow blinked his big black eyes. \u201cBrother, I really like that Sister.\u201dHe also liked Sister\u2019s dog\u2026The little fellow added in his heart.4The man\u2019s eyes were calm and firm as he tapped his slender fingers listlessly on the armrest.\u201cIt\u2019s already a pain with a troublesome one at home.\u201dThese words made the little fellow\u2019s mouth snap shut.There were 360 days in a year where his brother\u2019s gaze on him looked like he wanted to throw him away.4\u2026In the restaurant.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)\u201cThird Brother, your call still hasn\u2019t gotten through? I\u2019ve asked Uncle Wang and Pei Yunge is already nearby.\u201d It wasn\u2019t clear whether Qin Youjiao was saying it intentionally or not.The first reaction Qin Lang had when he heard this was that Pei Yunge had an accident.He stood up and wanted to look for her!It was at that moment that Pei Yunge appeared in front of him.\u201cGe\u2019er, you\u2019re here.\u201dQin Lang looked at Pei Yunge. Seeing that she was fine, he let out a sigh of relief.It was good that she was all right.\u201cDon\u2019t come if you don\u2019t want to. There\u2019s no need to ignore me and Third Brother.\u201dQin Youjiao wanted to say something more, but she subconsciously shut her mouth when she felt Qin Lang\u2019s cold gaze on her.\u201cGe\u2019er, didn\u2019t you want to study at Hengde High School before? I\u2019ve already made arrangements, you can go to school in two days.\u201d1What?!\u00a0Qin Lang\u2019s words made Qin Youjiao lose her temper.\u201cThird Brother, how can she be in the same school as me?!\u201dWhat was she going to do if someone found out that Pei Yunge was the real daughter of the Qin family?!Wouldn\u2019t she be ridiculed in school??!\u201cWhy can\u2019t Ge\u2019er be in the same school as you?\u201dQin Lang\u2019s eyes turned cold and this made Qin Youjiao feel bitter and aggrieved in her heart. All day, Third Brother\u2019s attitude towards her was not good. He even treated Pei Yunge like she was some sort of priceless treasure!\u201cI\u2019m fine with it. It\u2019s up to you,\u201d Pei Yunge replied calmly.In her previous life, Pei Yunge\u2019s parents were divorced. Before she was 18 years old, she stayed with her mother, a famous scientist and finished a special class for the gifted young in university at the age of 12. She only returned to her father\u2019s company and became the heir of the corporation after her mother passed away.High school\u2026 Pei Yunge only had a vague conception about high school because she had only studied there for three months.\u201cYou\u2019re fine with it?\u201dQin Youjiao found it funny and her tone was scornful. \u201cAre you sure you can keep up?\u201dThis was the first time Pei Yunge had heard someone ask her this and her eyes fell on Qin Youjiao for some time.After a period of silence, she licked her red lips.\u201cI\u2019ll try?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What\u2019s the point for you to study there for a month?\u201dHow could she not know Pei Yunge\u2019s level? Since she could not even keep up with her former high school, how could she even think of keeping up with Hengde?Qin Lang interrupted her and looked at Pei Yunge. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019ve already contacted the principal. Our family donated a building to them last time, so they won\u2019t let you drop out.\u201dWhen she heard this, Qin Youjiao\u2019s expression darkened to the point it almost dripped with ink!Still, Qin Youjiao held it in and comforted herself that Third Brother was treating Pei Yunge better because of the Old Master.After that, she could not help sneering in her heart.All right. Since Pei Yunge wanted to come, she would make Pei Yunge realize the real gap between them!Caught in between the unintended crossfire, Pei Yunge also furrowed her eyebrows. She did not know if Qin Lang was doing this on a whim or giving her alms.But at this moment, no one noticed the sweat on Qin Lang\u2019s hands.In his previous life, he also learned later that Pei Yunge was blackmailed and even bullied in her former high school. It had become so terrible that she had developed a serious communication disorder.1Now that he was reborn, he could not let it happen again.A trace of determination flashed past Qin Lang\u2019s eyes.\u2026After dinner, Pei Yunge went out of the restaurant and waited for them outside.Seeing this, Qin Lang seemed to be afraid that Pei Yunge would get bullied along the way. He put down his knife and fork, wiped the corners of his mouth before he followed her out.Qin Youjiao\u2019s expression had turned dark when she saw this. Feeling terribly aggrieved, she grumbled and could not help calling Mrs Qin.Soon, Mrs Qin\u2019s gentle voice came through on the phone.\u201cJiaojiao, what happened? Or do you miss me?\u201d\u201cMom, will you not want me one day?\u201d Qin Youjiao suppressed the urge to cry.\u201cSilly child, what are you thinking? You\u2019ll always be my daughter.

Your third brother dotes on you the most. Even when you were a child, he was holding you to himself and not letting you go.\u201dQin Youjiao also recalled the good memories from before when she heard this. \u201cThird Brother really won\u2019t ignore me?\u201d Qin Youjiao thought of Qin Lang\u2019s recent attitude and still felt slightly vexed.\u201cIt\u2019s normal for girls to think too much,\u201d Mrs Qin said forgivingly, \u201cYour third brother might be too stressed out. He\u2019s busy with the club\u2019s recruitment.\u201dA huge relief came over Qin Youjiao when she heard Mrs Qin say this.\u201cMom, if\u2026 If you don\u2019t want me one day, I\u2019ll make room for Pei Yunge.\u201dMrs Qin\u2019s attitude became colder when she heard Pei Yunge\u2019s name.She scolded her slightly, \u201cWhat nonsense are you saying? You\u2019re the real eldest young lady of the Qin family. Who dares to ask you to go? Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t let anyone take away everything that belongs to you.\u201d5The corners of Qin Youjiao\u2019s lips lifted and her eyes filled with pride.Originally, as long as Pei Yunge was obedient, Qin Youjiao could get along with her peacefully.2But who asked Pei Yunge to fight with her?After hanging up the call, Mrs Qin transferred two hundred thousand dollars to Qin Youjiao for her to go out with her friends.She did not mention Pei Yunge at all.\u2026Two days later.The news that there would be a new transfer student to Class Seven had spread all over Hengde high school. It was said that the student had some connections with the family of the school belle, Qin Youjiao.Everyone knew that Class Seven was the real \u2018backdoor\u2019 class.Although there were good students who had to stay in Class Seven for the scholarship, most of them were people from the rich and affluent families.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s a girl.\u201dA sneer crossed her face as her lips twisted in irritation, \u201cAnd it\u2019s someone who has something to do with Qin Youjiao\u2019s family. But, as the eldest young lady of the Qin family, Qin Youjiao passed the examination and got into the top class. What about this one?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a rumor, but she might be some relative of the Qin family.\u201dAnother girl gloated, with a strong sense of superiority in her tone. \u201cEven the school belle\u2019s family can\u2019t avoid poor relatives.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think the transfer student looks like?\u201d\u201cIf she\u2019s from the countryside, it would already be good if she has regular features.\u201dAt this moment.Pei Yunge, who was being discussed by the entire class, had just pushed open the office door and did not expect to meet the original male protagonist who had left a deep impression on her.Cheng Zihuai\u2019s appearance was really charming. Handsome to a fault, even wearing the ordinary school uniform could hardly conceal his outstanding demeanor.However, what left a deep impression on Pei Yunge was that Cheng Zihuai had an engagement with the original female protagonist.To make Qin Youjiao angry, he deliberately treated the original female protagonist well in front of everyone, but when they were alone, he would not let the original female protagonist have any wishful thinking towards him. He had even hit the female protagonist for Qin Youjiao.5And Cheng Zihuai had many pursuers, so the original female protagonist had suffered a lot of humiliation. In the end, all she got was seeing Qin Youjiao and Cheng Zihuai together lovingly.When she thought of this, Pei Yunge narrowed her eyes, a dangerous expression on her face.At this moment, Cheng Zihuai turned his head as if he felt a gaze behind him.The moment he saw Pei Yunge, a trace of surprise flashed past his eyes, but soon he felt that this girl seemed to be a little familiar.\u201cPei Yunge?\u201dEven Cheng Zihuai, the original male protagonist who was always calm, was in disbelief.But it was just for a moment.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)Cheng Zihuai frowned and remembered what Qin Youjiao had told him yesterday about how Pei Yunge had thrown a tantrum and asked the Qin family\u2019s brother to let her transfer schools.And, it was mostly because of him.\u201cDo you really have to come chasing after me here?\u201d There was a touch of sarcasm in Cheng Zihuai\u2019s tone.Who knew that the girl in front of him swept her pair of excessively beautiful eyes over him indifferently. Instead of responding, she ignored him and went to the form teacher of Class Seven.\u201cExcuse me, are you Mr Wen?\u201dMr Wen looked at the exquisite and charming girl in front of him and felt slightly surprised. \u201cAre you the new transfer student?\u201d\u201cMm,\u201d Pei Yunge replied lazily.At this moment, Cheng Zihuai, who was ignored, regained his senses. Pei Yunge came to find the form teacher and not him?He did not know why, but he felt a little uncomfortable in his heart.Pressing his lips into a thin line, Cheng Zihuai remembered Pei Yunge\u2019s excessive enthusiasm towards him from the past and turned to leave.At this moment, the form teacher could not help gossiping.\u201cDo you know Cheng Zihuai?\u201d After all, he was the top student across all of the third-year cohort!\u201cMm.\u201d Pei Yunge lowered her eyes. The corners of her eyes were slightly red and it seemed like she had stayed up late for a long period.\u201cHow do you know each other?\u201dThe form teacher seemed interested, but Pei Yunge suddenly sneered and said in an ambiguous tone, \u201cThe mental hospital.\u201d2The form teacher was speechless. Yes, he knew that this student had just come out of the mental hospital.\u2026The bell signaled the start of the day.Class Seven was bustling with noise and excitement.

The transfer student was timid and withdrawn, not good-looking, and had poor grades. She was the typical type that did not dare to say anything even when she was bullied.Wasn\u2019t this giving Class Seven a plaything?What\u2019s more, the newcomer herself was easily left out. Many of them were indeed looking at this school belle\u2019s relative with disdain and malicious eyes.Until the form teacher came in.He turned around and said to the person outside with a smile, \u201cOkay, come in.\u201dAt this moment, a figure at the door stepped in.The noisy students immediately stopped their actions and could not help staring at the girl who had walked in.Beautiful. As if held captive under a spell, it was hard not to be drawn to the girl\u2019s eyes, which were enchanting and bright to the point that it made people remember it at one glance. She swept those unforgettable eyes around with the lazy and uncaring indifference akin to an otherworldly being.The aura on her could not be kept in, and it made people think of these four words, \u2018someone out of reach\u2019.A few seconds later.\u201cMy name is Pei Yunge.\u201d\u2026The minds of the people in the class turned blank.This was the transfer student of their class?!Wasn\u2019t she someone who was not good-looking, and one that no one would give another look when placed in a crowd??!But if she stood beside Qin Youjiao with this kind of appearance, it could make the school belle look dull\u2026\u201cHmm\u2026 Is there anything else you want to add?\u201d The form teacher was giving out hints crazily.\u201cThere is.\u201dWithout waiting for the form teacher to breathe a sigh of relief, she asked seriously, \u201cTeacher, where am I sitting?\u201dThe form teacher was speechless.\u201cChoose one of the empty seats.\u201dInternally, the form teacher comforted himself.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)This was a girl, a lovely girl, so she would not cause him any trouble. But Pei Yunge did not know the thoughts of the form teacher and swept her eyes over the two vacant seats left in the class.One was next to a girl by the window, but it was full of the girl\u2019s things.It was obvious that she did not want Pei Yunge to sit there.Seeing this, Pei Yunge did not think much about it and went to the other seat. This bold move made the people around her feel afraid.\u201cIs this transfer student crazy? How daring of her to sit beside Brother Lu\u2026\u201d\u201cHaha, maybe she still hasn\u2019t heard about it. She must have a death wish to want to provoke Lu Yuansi.\u201dMany people in the class were ready to watch the show.Generally speaking, most of the boys had sympathy for beautiful girls. But before Pei Yunge had even arrived, Qin Youjiao had already made people have a bad impression on this transfer student.This poor relative came looking for the Qin family and still had the cheek to ask to study at Hengde. In the end, she was just another materialistic and shameless person.\u2026Back at the present\u2026Pei Yunge glanced at the figure of an unknown gender who was sleeping deeply beside her. She pulled out the chair and put her bag on the table.\u201cNewcomer, wake your deskmate up!\u201d The teacher with the bald head bald announced.1Hearing this, the other students could not help secretly cursing this teacher. Usually, he did not even dare to provoke Lu Yuansi, but now he was asking the new student to wake him up.Did he think that Lu Yuansi would not hit girls?Pei Yunge frowned and lifted the corners of her lips.\u201cTeacher, what if we get into a fight?\u201dOne of the girls laughed when she heard this. \u201cNot bad, you also know that Lu Yuansi is not to be provoked.\u201dThis tone was mixed with strong sarcasm and jealousy.It was obvious she felt that Pei Yunge had some other intentions to sit beside Lu Yuansi.\u201cWhat are you talking about?!\u201dThe teacher\u2019s face was flushed red and he said with disdain, \u201cEnough, sit down quickly!\u201dThe teacher turned to look at the blackboard and muttered, \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to handle this class, but now there\u2019s another transfer student.

The reason they did not like her was because their workload would be increased, or that she would drag down the average score of the class.At this moment, the scornful eyes of the people around glanced at Pei Yunge.This kind of person who pestered the Qin family deserved to be left out.\u2026After Pei Yunge sat down, she did not seem to care about the gazes around her. When everyone was ready for class, she put on her wireless earphones, turned on her iPad, and covered it with her textbook.When she went through her mailbox, she saw that there was nothing new. According to the time, she should be getting a reply today since the information was submitted the day before yesterday.Pei Yunge thought for a moment before stuffing the iPad into the shelf under her desk again.\u2026After class.The people around Pei Yunge finally moved and took off their school uniforms. Suddenly, she heard a slightly cold voice beside her.\u201cWho are you?\u201dPei Yunge turned her head to look when she heard the voice.The boy was wearing a black T-shirt and was handsome, with a bit of rebelliousness and uncaring indifference in his eyes. The boy was also studying her at the same time.Pei Yunge looked away. She was not as afraid of him like the other girls, nor did she have any interest in him.The corners of her eyes lifted. \u201cSomeone who has nothing to do with you.\u201d1As soon as her voice fell, the two students who were sitting in front of them felt a chill on their backs.This was the first time they had met someone who dared to speak to Brother Lu like that!\u201cWhy are you sitting here?\u201dLu Yuansi frowned. His voice was slightly hoarse but was pleasant to the ears.Instead of answering, Pei Yunge only looked at him casually.The meaning was clear \u2013 you can see for yourself if you are not blind.Lu Yuansi was silent for a moment before he suddenly laughed, but the expression in his eyes was indifferent. \u201cYou\u2019re Youjiao\u2019s relative?\u201d(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)2Hearing this, Pei Yunge suddenly remembered that in the original novel, it seemed that the second male protagonist was from Class Seven.Although she could not remember his name, the back burner spirit of the second male protagonist could make people sigh.So this was the person who was with Qin Youjiao when she was in love and was there to talk to her after she broke up. Even when she got married and had children, he was by her side when she went abroad after fighting with Cheng Zihuai.\u201cYou\u2019re the first person who dares to sit next to me.\u201d Lu Yuansi spoke again, his tone unclear, but Pei Yunge heard a trace of ridicule in it. \u201cYou can have someone change with you.\u201dPei Yunge raised her eyebrows lazily, an unruly look in her charming eyes.\u201cNo need.\u201dLu Yuansi said lightly, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I plan to be special, but I don\u2019t want anyone to disturb me.\u201d Speaking of this, the corners of his slips suddenly curved. \u201cNew deskmate, let me remind you. Youjiao is very popular.\u201dWith that said, he picked up his school uniform and went out of the classroom.Lu Yuansi knew what kind of trouble Pei Yunge would encounter, but he was not a hero who would save the damsel in distress.He simply did not like trouble.\u2026Lu Yuansi did not come back to class even after lessons had started. The teacher on the lectern glanced at Lu Yuansi\u2019s seat but did not say a word.It was obvious that this was not the first time he had skipped class.At noon.Pei Yunge received a reply email and her eyebrows moved unconsciously. She got up and went to the roof level of the school.First things first. Because this was her first time in an alternate world, Pei Yunge had to find a job. With the background and age of the original protagonist, there were almost no suitable jobs.So Pei Yunge could only find an old trade from abroad.\u2026The moment Pei Yunge left, several girls from Class Seven gathered together.\u201cSister Ling, this poor relative of Qin Youjiao is really devious.

But Qin Youjiao and Cheng Zihuai from the third year were a pair, so she was not worried at all.But now, a transfer student from a third-rate high school dared to compete with her.Ling Jiwei sneered. \u201cIt\u2019s time to teach her how to behave herself.\u201dThe other girls could not help but take pleasure in this when they heard her words.\u201cIs Sister Ling going to protect your husband?\u201d One of the girls tried to curry up to Ling Jiwei on purpose.The corners of Ling Jiwei\u2019s lips lifted arrogantly.\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense.

Only a few boys looked silently at Pei Yunge and felt sympathy for her.This method was a little too cruel.Ling Jiwei looked at Pei Yunge\u2019s motionless back from the podium and let out an angry breath. Then she jumped down lightly and said with a relaxed and satisfied smile, \u201cNewcomer, I think I have to teach you some manners.\u201dSuddenly\u30fcPei Yunge said, \u201cWho did this?\u201dAll the people were stunned when they heard this.

Pei Yunge, has anyone told you that you think too highly of yourself?\u201dThe moment her voice fell, a person stood at the door.Lu Yuansi had returned.He glanced at the two people who were in an awkward atmosphere and only understood what had happened when he went to his desk.Lu Yuansi furrowed his eyebrows and inexplicably felt that he could not bear to see this.\u201cWho did it?\u201d Lu Yuansi asked.The people in the classroom were even more surprised after he had asked this!When did Lu Yuansi care about this type of thing?At this moment, Ling Jiwei\u2019s pupils constricted.

But Lu Yuansi would always do it again, and they had never seen the school care about it.After all, the Lu family was rich and powerful.\u201cAlright.\u201dLu Yuansi gave a perfunctory reply.Seeing this, the dean no longer stared at Lu Yuansi, but turned his attention to Pei Yunge.He frowned and said in an obviously displeased tone, \u201cYou\u2019re the new transfer student?\u201dThis student was very famous in their teaching group. Most of the teachers did not agree to let a student who could not keep up in an ordinary high school to stay in Hengde.But the principal\u2019s attitude was firm and insisted on accepting her into the school.\u201cNow that you\u2019re in Hengde, don\u2019t bring your previous practices here. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be useless anywhere you go!\u201dThere was an indescribable disgust in the dean\u2019s tone. \u201cAren\u2019t you going back to your seat?\u201dInstead of getting angry, Pei Yunge smiled. Her eyes were very good-looking and her smile was bright. \u201cTeacher, I\u2019ll let you have a seat first?\u201dBefore the dean could react, he saw that the seat beside Lu Yuansi was a mess.A hideous mess.It could be seen at one glance that someone had played a prank.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)\u201cWho bullied the new student?\u201d the dean asked harshly, but inwardly, he did not take it seriously. It was best for this newcomer to drop out of school.1\u201cTeacher, I think it\u2019s an accident.\u201dOne of the girls, who had a good relationship with Ling Jiwei, said with a smile.The dean subconsciously looked at Ling Jiwei after he heard this, and suddenly knew who might have done it. Not only the students, but also the teachers knew what their students were like in private.This matter was practically screaming Ling Jiwei\u2019s style.\u201cI will find out what happened and get the person to apologize.\u201dThe dean thought about it before speaking. His nephew was still working under Ling Jiwei\u2019s father so he could not really anger this child.Like this, the matter would be settled.But he did not expect that Pei Yunge would suddenly laugh, before she said slowly, \u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201dThe people were unable to react for a moment, and saw Pei Yunge suddenly walking to the other side.Without waiting for the people to react, the girl lifted her long leg and kicked Ling Jiwei\u2019s table over in front of everyone!The sound made the people\u2019s scalps tingle!The things on the table scattered all around and Ling Jiwei\u2019s expression changed in an instant!Pei Yunge suddenly turned her head, her beautiful eyes raised and she licked her lips casually. Her eyes were wild and brazen as she glanced at Ling Jiwei\u2019s appalled expression.\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m in a bad mood today.\u201dAt that moment, the students in the class were shocked. Even the dean had turned green in the face!What was the matter with this transfer student!?She was so arrogant in front of him and thought she could just apologize after doing that?Was she deliberately using her actions to go against his solution of making the person apologize?! Wasn\u2019t this giving him a slap in the face?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You\u2019re good! You\u2019re creating trouble in front of me, are you?\u201dThe dean was so angry that it was turning dark in front of his eyes, and he roared as he pointed to Pei Yunge, his finger visibly shaking.What was this! He could not handle Lu Yuansi, but couldn\u2019t he handle a transfer student who was nothing?!?\u201cTeacher, I know I\u2019m wrong. Don\u2019t be so fierce.\u201dThe good-looking girl in front of him had her eyes lowered and looked very well-behaved, which made people have a sudden impulse to forgive her.At the same time, the English teacher, who was not aware of the truth, came into the classroom and recognized the new student at a glance.She frowned and said unhappily, \u201cDean, she has just transferred schools and still hasn\u2019t gotten used to the environment. Why are you forcing her like this?\u201d1This child must feel terrible being reprimanded in front of so many people!The class became silent for a moment.What a master in enchanting people!By this point, the dean\u2019s face turned red and then his expression darkened!\u201cYou\u2019re acting now are you? I\u2019ll call your parents now! We\u2019ll have everyone see your true colors!\u201dThe dean left in a fit of anger.\u2026In the office.The dean found Pei Yunge\u2019s information and made a phone call.Qin Lang was training at the base and his voice had the slight hoarseness of someone who had just woken up.\u201cHello?\u201d\u201cHello, this is the dean of Hengde. I want to ask\u2026\u201d(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)\u201cIs Ge\u2019er being bullied?!\u201dQin Lang became wide awake and asked immediately. The dean\u2019s forehead throbbed. \u201cPei Yunge picked on her classmate maliciously, and\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense. Why don\u2019t you say she committed murder and arson?\u201d Qin Lang sneered, having heard such absurd words for the first time. It was ludicrous.This was the dean of Hengde? He was so good at lying through his teeth?\u201cYou really have to have some words with Pei Yunge. She\u2019s not who you imagine she is.\u201d The dean was really going to vomit blood from being so angered by these people!Qin Lang\u2019s eyes turned cold when he heard this.\u201cYou\u2019re the dean, right? My sister is someone with communication disorder. If something happens to her in school, don\u2019t even think about evading any responsibility!\u201dWith that, Qin Lang hung up the phone, put on his headset and continued the livestream.But he was distracted.Ge\u2019er had been packing her things these two days and was ready to move away. He called yesterday and asked Qin Yu to think of a solution. Why wasn\u2019t he doing anything?Forget it, he would ask him after the livestream ended.Qin Lang could not help thinking of the dean just now and mocked him. \u201cWhat a rubbish teacher.\u201dHis words were accidentally captured by the microphone.The fans who were watching the livestream were in an uproar.[Honey, wait. Who are you talking about?][Was Crush talking to a teacher just now? Was it his sister\u2019s teacher?][Wait a minute. I just got online. What sister?][Crush is the young master of the Qin family. Do you know Qin Youjiao? The princess of the Qin family and doted on by thousands. God Qin was so doting just now! Damn his sister complex!][Hahahaha, some captain scolded his teammates in the base, but dissed his sister\u2019s teacher secretly!]In less than two hours, #CrushSisterComplex appeared as the hottest trending topic and Qin Youjiao\u2019s life that made people envious was dug out.The only daughter of the Qin family was a straight A student since she was a child and had gotten many awards.

The fans are all mentioning you! You\u2019re the only one who doesn\u2019t think much about it!\u201dWhen she heard this, Qiao Youjiao assumed that Qin Lang had mentioned her casually on his livestream again. The corners of her lips lifted unconsciously and she deliberately said, \u201cI had a fight with him recently. Don\u2019t talk to me about him!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m jealous. You threw a temper at such a fairy-like brother? Ahhh I\u2019m so envious!\u201d\u2026In the villa area.The man had just taken a bath and threw on a bathrobe. As he swept back his black hair, the collar of his bathrobe was loose, showing his firm chest that made people blush and their hearts beat a million miles a second.Although his temperament was lazy, his eyes were cold and restrained.Huo Shidu picked up the phone that had rang for a long time. \u201cSpeak.\u201dThe person on the other end of the line was silent for a moment, but it was obviously not because of Huo Shidu\u2019s attitude.\u201cMaster Du, how about helping me take care of my child?\u201dAs soon as the voice fell, Huo Shidu hung up the call and went to the bathroom. He went back to his bedroom after drying his hair and changing his clothes, and found that the phone was still ringing.After answering the call again, Huo Shidu\u2019s tone was indifferent and he snorted. \u201cDo I look like I\u2019m very free?\u201dThe little one in the old mansion was almost thrown into the garbage can.\u201cMaster Du, I really need your help. My child is throwing a tantrum and doesn\u2019t want to stay at home, but I\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t be safe. Can you do me a favor?\u201d3This was the first time Qin Yu was asking for help and his tone was helpless. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to take care of the little one. She\u2019ll be quiet if you are fierce to her.\u201d1This was just talk. After all, Qin Yu knew Ge\u2019er\u2019s character. She might not even have the courage to talk to Huo Shidu.\u201cWhere did this child come from?\u201dWhen Huo Shidu met Qin Yu, Qin Yu had fallen out with his family and he did not hear him mention anything about his family.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)\u201cIt\u2019s my biological sister.\u201dHuo Shidu did not agree. He was not interested in raising a delicate little girl at home. However, Qin Yu seemed to be grasping at straws and kept calling.But in the end, he was ruthlessly blocked.There was a reason why Qin Yu was so adamant on asking Huo Shidu. The past few years he had been in the entertainment industry, those around him were basically fair-weather friends.Wasn\u2019t he putting a lamb in a tiger\u2019s den if he let his Ge\u2019er stay in their homes?But Huo Shidu was different. He and Huo Shidu had known each other for several years, but he had never seen any women around him. He was a person with few desires and did not get involved in women.Therefore, Qin Yu regarded Huo Shidu as a safe person.9\u2026In the afternoon.Huo Shidu finished handling documents when he received a message from Qin Yu who had shamelessly sent it from his assistant\u2019s phone.\u2018Master Du, just for two months. I\u2019m sure I can coax her home after that.\u2019Then, he sent the information of Pei Yunge to Huo Shidu, including a recent picture of Pei Yunge.When the man\u2019s slender and long finger slid to the picture, he stopped.Interest appeared in his cold and light-colored pupils.It was her.\u2026Abroad in the backstage of a concert.Qin Yu received a reply from Huo Shidu, \u2018Let me think about it.\u2019Seeing this, Qin Yu thought that it was his perseverance that had moved Huo Shidu.4He could not help but breathe a sigh of relief.\u2026In Hengde high school.The news that the transfer student of Class Seven was even more good looking than Qiao Youjiao had spread all over the school. But she made her classmate look bad in front of the teacher the moment she came!What was the use of having good looks? She was also an ignorant idler.The only reason she could enter Hengde was because she was leeching onto Qin Youjiao\u2019s family!How shameless and despicable!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How dare she kick my desk today!\u201d Ling Jiwei gritted her teeth and snapped waspishly.If the form teacher had not given a warning to both parties, she was bound to punish Pei Yunge harshly!Qin Youjiao\u2019s eyes flashed with a trace of emotion and she touched her bandaged hand.\u201cDon\u2019t blame her. She\u2019s suffered a bit of a blow ever since she pushed me down the stairs and my brothers sent her to a mental hospital.\u201d\u201cA mental hospital?\u201dLing Jiwei was surprised, to say the least.\u201cShe has always been a loner. In her former school\u2026 she was once recommended to quit.\u201dQin Youjiao smiled. \u201cIt seems like she was caught cheating in an exam and there was quite an uproar. Don\u2019t spread this out, it\u2019s not good for her.\u201d3Ling Jiwei\u2019s eyes twinkled, but she replied indifferently with a smile. \u201cOf course not. But really, there is nothing to compare between this poor relative and a rich young lady like yourself. I heard that you got second in the end-of-term exams, and first in physics. Mr Jin praises you every day in our class.\u201d1A smile that could not be suppressed appeared on Qin Youjiao\u2019s lips. \u201cI\u2019m in good condition this time.\u201d\u2026After school.Pei Yunge took out her cell phone and found that an unknown overseas number had called her many times. Her eyebrows shot up and the call was answered the moment she called back.\u201cIs this Miss Pei?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Pei Yunge replied.\u201cI\u2019m Marcus and I called you just now. I want to confirm if you are really not considering coming to our country for development?\u201dThis was not the first Marcus had asked about this. He had been trying to persuade her to immigrate and change her nationality.1The expression in Pei Yunge\u2019s eyes dimmed and she gave a lazy chuckle. \u201cMr Marcus, I hope we can be sensible people.\u201d\u201cThen why aren\u2019t you staying in your country\u2019s computing institute?\u201d Marcus could not help asking.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)He was curious about this person. He knew almost all the top contenders in the field of computing technology, but it was as if she had appeared out of the blue.As the application deadline was this month, this person had hacked into the official website of their institute of computing technology and deliberately left a loophole.It seemed like she was polite enough to let them make a choice on whether they wanted her or not. But in fact, she knew that they would let her stay because of her thesis on directionality and data visualization.\u201cThey don\u2019t want me.\u201dPei Yunge\u2019s red lips curved, but this reason was not convincing to Marcus. With her level, the computing institutes of various countries would be scrambling to get her to accept them?!\u201cOkay, then we\u2019ll sign a temporary contract and pay you three months\u2019 remuneration according to your request. If you want to change your mind, our country will always welcome talented people like you,\u201d Marcus said sincerely.1In any circle, ability was first and foremost and this lady had it in spades.\u201cThank you.\u201dPei Yunge\u2019s knitted eyebrows relaxed and the corners of her lips lifted up. But she did not expect to see Lu Yuansi behind her the moment she turned around.\u201cI have to go. We\u2019ll talk next time.\u201dPei Yunge hung up the call and heard Lu Yuansi ask.\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d\u201cThe boss of my part-time job.\u201dAfter Pei Yunge had finished speaking, Lu Yuansi realized that most girls of this age liked to wear some accessories, like Qin Youjiao, whose watch alone was worth hundreds of thousands dollars.But there was nothing of the sort on Pei Yunge.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This impassive and laidback countenance made Lu Yuansi\u2019s eyelid jump.She was at least a distant relative of the Qin family, but why was her character so different from Qin Youjiao?As the eldest young lady of the Qin family, Qin Youjiao could do almost everything. Even her grades were the top three of her year and she had never fallen below that.She was very demanding of herself and expected nothing less.How could they be so different?\u2026The night was getting darker.In the Qin family home.Before Pei Yunge entered the hall, she heard the tinkling sounds of the piano from inside.The moment she looked up, she saw a pair of elegant mother and daughter under the crystal chandelier, playing the piano intimately and completely in sync.The original protagonist had seen this scene several times. A faint smile appeared on her lips and carrying her bag, she was about to go back to her room.1\u201cGe\u2019er!\u201dQin Lang, who had been waiting anxiously by the side, called out to her.It was only then that Mrs Qin and Qin Youjiao then noticed Pei Yunge.A dark look flashed past Qin Youjiao\u2019s eyes. She turned to look at Mrs Qin and said in a spoiled manner. \u201cMom, I told you I\u2019d hurt my hand. Are you deliberately using me to serve as a contrast to you?\u201dBefore Mrs Qin could take another look at Pei Yunge, her eyes fell on Qin Youjiao again.She found it amusing and reached out to touch Qin Youjiao\u2019s nose. \u201cWhy is your character so competitive like mine when I was young?\u201d(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)Those who did not know would think that they really were mother and daughter.\u201cStop playing and let\u2019s eat.\u201d Perhaps feeling the unusual atmosphere, Mr Qin, who was sitting on the sofa, interrupted. Then, his eyes fell on Pei Yunge.He was stunned. Perhaps it was because he did not expect that Pei Yunge\u2019s face would look like this without all of that makeup.\u201cGirls look much better without thick makeup,\u201d Mr Qin said lightly.Pei Yinge slowly glanced at the people around her, and for the first time, felt that eating would be too much trouble.\u201cI\u2019ll put my bag away first,\u201d she said before she walked upstairs.Hearing this, Mr Qin could not help but look at Pei Yunge\u2019s retreating back. He rarely saw her having such a lazy and indifferent expression.At this moment, Qin Youjiao\u2019s voice interrupted Mr Qin\u2019s thoughts. \u201cDad, I\u2019m second in the year and I\u2019m just two points below the person who was first. Will you be coming to my parents-teacher meeting?\u201dA trace of affection appeared on Mr Qin\u2019s cold face when he heard this. \u201cDidn\u2019t I say you have to be first?\u201d\u201cBut this time, I won an award,\u201d Qin Youjiao said with a tilt of her head.\u201cWhat award?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t tell you if you don\u2019t go!\u201dMr Qin could not help laughing. \u201cAh, someone definitely spoils you too much usually. Fine, I will attend.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean spoil Jiaojiao? Daughters are for us to dote on,\u201d Mrs Qin disagreed.2The atmosphere of this family of three was extremely harmonious. Meanwhile, Qin Lang was seated at the side with a cigarette between his lips, not saying a word. He seemed to be in low spirits.In the past, was this how Ge\u2019er saw their family, including the three brothers? Always being so caring towards Qin Youjiao? Perhaps in her heart, she had long felt that she was an outsider.Qin Lang felt even more uncomfortable thinking of this.\u201cWhy are you sitting there? Didn\u2019t you hear your father say to have dinner?\u201d Mrs Qin gestured him over.\u201cWhy are we eating when not everyone is here?\u201d Qin Lang\u2019s languid tone was slightly cold.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Strange\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re here. Let\u2019s go and have dinner,\u201d Mr Qin took the lead and said.\u201cMm,\u201d Pei Yunge replied without much care and sat down together with them.After a while, Mr Qin found a topic to talk about. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come back with Jiaojiao?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t want to.\u201dPei Yunge\u2019s concise reply made Mrs Qin frown. But when she looked up and met with Pei Yunge\u2019s eyes, she froze.It seemed she had forgotten what she wanted to say.Pei Yunge\u2019s eyes were similar to hers. Even though it gave people a totally different feeling.Mrs Qin immediately looked away and picked up the wine glass with her hand shaking slightly. There was an almost indiscernible sense of anxiety in her actions.She could never erase this blood relation.Never.This scene was seen by Pei Yunge, and she remained calm and composed as she watched Mrs Qin, a mocking look in her eyes.Out of the blue, Mr Qin asked, \u201cThe old madam of the Lu family is having a birthday party in a few days. Yunge, do you want to go?\u201dThis question almost made Qin Youjiao\u2019s hand freeze and her back stiffened.If Pei Yunge went, wouldn\u2019t her identity be exposed sooner or later?\u201cUsually, these are all attended by Jiaojiao, there\u2019s no need to change it,\u201d Mrs Qin suddenly interrupted worriedly, as though she was afraid that Pei Yunge might snatch away Qin Youjiao\u2019s things.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)Qin Lang\u2019s eyes turned even colder. \u201cMom, up until now, nobody knows that Ge\u2019er is our\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t you be considerate to your sister?!\u201d Mrs Qin interrupted Qin Lang and questioned him accusingly.Seeing how Mrs Qin was protecting Qin Youjiao so fiercely, Qin Lang clenched his fists.He really wanted to tell Mrs Qin that the daughter she had loved so dearly, did not even attend her funeral when she had passed away in such a miserable state!1What sister? Did this so-called beloved daughter of hers even deserve to be here?Not only that, Ge\u2019er, the daughter whom Mrs Qin regarded as nothing, threw half of her life away to donate her bone marrow to her when her body was in a bad condition!Qin Lang took a deep breath. \u201cIs Ge\u2019er not my sister?\u201dHearing this family arguing for the first time because of her, Pei Yunge\u2019s eyebrows moved unconsciously.\u201cYoujiao has always been a pride of our Qin family and the Cheng family will also attend this birthday party,\u201d Mrs Qin retorted after not knowing what to say for a moment.But she did not feel that her words were indirectly saying that Pei Yunge would be an embarrassment to her.Before Mr Qin could say anything, Pei Yunge laughed.\u201cI don\u2019t want to go.\u201dIn fact, she just wanted to break away from the Qin family. The original protagonist really had a good temper to be able to stay in this home for so many years.\u201cGe\u2019er, Zihuai doesn\u2019t\u2026 have feelings for you.\u201d Mr Qin paused. \u201cBut I can see that he likes Jiaojiao. I don\u2019t want our family relationship to be ruined because of this.\u201dOf course, how would she not understand? Reading between the lines, these words were all said to protect Qin Youjiao.Pei Yunge picked at the rice. She had no appetite and the coldness in her eyes was surging.In the end, her lips curved up into a faint smile. \u201cI\u2019ll answer only once. I\u2019m not interested in any of you, nor do I have any interest in that person from the Cheng family.\u201d1Immediately after that, Pei Yunge stood up and left the dining table. \u201cAlright, I\u2019m finished now.

She wasn\u2019t like she was now, reckless and outrageous!Now she was completely impervious to reason or advice!\u201cPei Yunge, I don\u2019t expect you to be as sensible and smart as Youjiao is, but can\u2019t you just listen?!\u201dIt was clear Mr Qin was livid.Beside them, the curve on Qin Youjiao\u2019s lips sunk a little as she watched this scene unfold before her eyes. It was also her first time seeing Mr Qin so furious.At this moment, Pei Yunge was already long gone, and it was unclear if she had heard Mr Qin\u2019s final words.\u201cSince we didn\u2019t raise her, the child will never be like our own.\u201dMrs Qin scooped a bowl of soup and passed it to Qin Youjiao. When she was about to scoop another bowl for Qin Lang, all she saw was Qin Lang putting down his chopsticks and walking outside as well.The expression on her face morphed into one of displeasure. \u201cQin Lang, where are you going?!\u201d\u201cLooking for my younger sister,\u201d Qin Lang said with slight ridicule as he wore a baseball cap that covered his handsome face.His words made Mrs Qin\u2019s expression change and change again within seconds!\u201cQin Lang!\u201dInstead of turning back, Qin Lang ran into the dark behind the door without a second glance.It was then that Mrs Qin finally realized that Qin Lang had really changed like Qin Youjiao had said.\u2026In Muse Bar.The atmosphere in the private room was ambiguous as guests were in a jovial mood as they wrapped their arms around women.The only man who had an indolent posture had his long legs crossed as he leaned against the sofa in a casual gait. His well-proportioned fingers were holding onto a cigarette. It was as if everything around him had nothing to do with him.Right at that moment, several women were silently checking out this man that made their hearts thump faster. However, because of his cold and calm expression, none of them dared to approach him.\u201cMaster Du, do you really not want anyone to serve you?\u201d The old President tried to curry favor and countless wrinkles and folds appeared on his face as he smiled.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)With that said, several of those women couldn\u2019t suppress their desire to be picked anymore.\u201cTake care of yourself.\u201d Huo Shidu\u2019s tone was slightly cold.Instantly, the old President felt his scalp turn numb and he no longer dared to say anything. At the same time, everyone else around them didn\u2019t dare to be too high as they played, because of this master beside them.Huo Shidu glanced at the watch on his wrist. He planned to return in 30 minutes.Today, if it wasn\u2019t because the Old Madam stayed at his house the entire day, he wouldn\u2019t be sitting here in the middle of the night either.Suddenly, the doors of the private room were pushed open and a drunk young man walked in with a woman in his arms.\u201cI saw a pretty girl just outside! Do all of you want to go and take a look at her together?\u201dThe man\u2019s appearance was not too shabby. However, his dark eye circles were pretty dark and it was obvious that he had over-indulged in sex and other associated activities.However, no one in the room dared to say anything.They were afraid that that Master would find them noisy.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll go myself.\u201d He sniggered lecherously as he pushed away the woman in his arms and sauntered out.Beep. Right at that moment, Huo Shidu received a message from Qin Yu.\u201cMaster Du, are you still in Muse?\u201d\u201c\u2026I think my younger sister went there, but my family can\u2019t find her. Can you help me check the CCTVs?\u201dQin Yu, who was overseas, currently had a dark expression as panic filed his heart. All he wanted was to return to the country as soon as possible.1He had never expected Ge\u2019er to have the guts to enter a bar now?!On the other hand, after reading the message, the man had already stood up and was walking straight out of the room.\u201cMaster Du, Master Du?! Where are you going?\u201d\u2026At the bar counter.Pei Yunge ordered a glass of cocktail with familiarity and ease. She sat by the counter and watched the performance. With a hand supporting her cheeks, she looked casual and uncaring, yet attractive at the same time. When she had her eyebrow half-raised, she looked incredibly charming.Instantly, she attracted the attention of several people in the bar.When one of the dancers on stage accidentally met her eyes, Pei Yunge\u2019s red lips curled up slightly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Meanwhile, her eyes remained fixed on the dancer as she slowly downed the entire glass.Seeing this, the women dancing sexily on stage somehow felt their heart speed up as heat made their faces flush rose.3All the while, the people who were cheering excitedly under the stage did not notice any abnormalities at all.\u201cDamn, that young miss is really good! She takes both men and women? It\u2019s my first time seeing it!\u201dWith that, a friend beside Lu Yuansi exclaimed as he stared at Pei Yunge. With that face of hers, even he wanted to jump and swim within the girl\u2019s pond!However, Lu Yuansi\u2019s expression darkened. It seemed like his desk mate\u2019s private life was even more unchaste than his. He even believed Pei Yunge\u2019s nonsense words about finding a part-time job!\u201cHowever, I feel that she looks a little familiar. Brother Lu, do you think\u2026\u201dBefore his friend could finish speaking, Lu Yuansi had already turned around to leave.\u201cHey, Brother Lu! Why aren\u2019t you waiting for me?!\u201d1\u2026At the bar counter.After the woman left the stage, she walked towards Pei Yunge and smiled brightly.\u201cMiss, if you\u2019re alone, can I sit here?\u201d She stared at Pei Yunge with eyes filled with interest.To be frank, for a person who had been in the entertainment industry for many years like her, she was already long immune to pretty faces.However, when she first saw this person before her, her brain still had an automatic conclusion.This girl was way too pretty. Yet, when she smiled brightly, her eyes were void of any warmth at all. She gave others a sense of mystery, making them unable to suppress their curiosity and approach her.\u201cI saw someone holding a camera when I came in. You should go change your clothes first.\u201dPei Yunge didn\u2019t even lift her head up.Hearing this, the woman froze for a second and caressed the mask on her face.\u201cYou recognized me?\u201d\u201cYour high notes are very stable. You have a pretty good image and you have a strong dance foundation. Yet, you\u2019re unable to become famous?\u201d Pei Yunge sounded as if she had randomly found a topic to chat about.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)However, her words struck the woman right in her weaknesses!Indeed, she came to do this part-time job because she wanted to seek some feels and emotion. However, currently, only two people knew of her actual identity.Yu Manran couldn\u2019t help but turn away and anyhow picked up a box of cigarettes. Her slender fingers had just picked up a cigarette and was about to push it between her lips.However, another hand suddenly took it away from her hands.\u201cDon\u2019t turn back and look at me.\u201d Pei Yunge\u2019s lazy voice murmured.Instantly, Yu Manran froze, realizing what was going on.Almost instinctively, she glanced at Pei Yunge and watched as she placed a hand on top of the counter, her eyes filled with an unconcerned laziness. Somehow, this action only made her look even more charming and attractive.With her elegant fingers clasping on the cigarette, it looked as if she was lazily caressing the woman\u2019s cheek.In reality in a corner nearby, the person who was sneakily taking photos was so angry his eyes almost turned black because he couldn\u2019t take a photo with Yu Manran\u2019s facial features!He clearly saw that Yu Manran wanted to smoke just now. In the end, all he took was someone else holding onto a cigarette and caressing Yu Manran\u2019s cheek!Besides, there was no way this photo could prove that it was Yu Manran!\u2026Not too long later, Pei Yunge returned the cigarette to Yu Manran. However, as if she was fearful now, Yu Manran threw the cigarette away instantly.What a relief! She was so close to being boycotted online. Her affinity with the public wasn\u2019t too good to begin with.\u201cTake note next time.\u201dWith that said, Pei Yunge left a few red dollar notes under the glass and got up to leave.Seeing this, Yu Manran panicked.\u201cCan you help me?\u201dShe didn\u2019t know why, but there was an unshakable feeling that Pei Yunge could help her.\u201cI-I can pay\u2026\u201d Yu Manran said softly.Once she was done speaking, she was already regretting her rashness. Would this person in front of her misunderstand her and think that she was humiliating her?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She took a few pieces of tissue and wiped her hands, before she got ready to leave.Suddenly, a voice rang from that side. \u201cMiss, why are you leaving? Aren\u2019t you staying to play with us?\u201dThe irritating laughter of those men, laced with evil intentions disrupted her departure. When Pei Yunge looked up, she saw someone blocking her way.\u201cYou can leave if you want. But, at least light a cigarette for our Young Master Ling first?\u201dHearing this, Pei Yunge\u2019s gaze landed on the person who looked obviously like a rich young master. Right at that moment, the man, who was called Young Master Ling, was also checking her out without any regards.He never thought that such a pretty thing would come to Muse!\u201cLight a cigarette?\u201dPei Yunge raised an eyebrow slightly as her smile never reached her eyes. However, to others, she looked extremely charming and seductive.\u201cSure.\u201dWith that, Pei Yunge took out a cigarette from the cigarette box.Before they could react, she even took out a lighter.They took in her sensible appearance, her obedience making it harder for them to hold back their desires.How rare was it to find such an obedient woman! It would be fun tonight!However, in the next second, the girl in front of them suddenly crouched down, holding the cigarette vertically as she casually lit it up with the lighter. Within seconds, white smoke filled the area.Seeing Pei Yunge\u2019s actions, the men\u2019s humor had yet to disappear. However, her eyes narrowed as they exuded a hidden glint of coldness.They heard Pei Yunge laugh playfully. \u201cLook at this cigarette, does it look like the joss sticks on top of your tombs?\u201d(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)1Suddenly, they couldn\u2019t keep on their smiles anymore, as their smiles slowly disappeared.\u201cYou can\u2019t tell what\u2019s good from bad, can you?\u201d Young Master Ling growled as he stared darkly at Pei Yunge.Before, he was still thinking of doting on this woman properly. After all, since she was so pretty, he should play with her a few more days. It would be so boring if he ruined her from the beginning.However, right now, it seemed as if she wanted to suffer more!\u201cYes, I\u2019m used to it. After all, I\u2019ve been like that for many years now.\u201dWith that, Pei Yunge stood up, her fingers playing with the lighter as she said with smirking lips. All the while, she remained calm and composed.The moment Young Master Ling heard her words, ruthlessness flashed in his eyes as he chuckled coldly.\u201cDid you hear her properly? Let\u2019s properly teach her how to speak with her tongue today!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe group of men approached Pei Yunge, arrogance filling their minds as they didn\u2019t even take Pei Yunge seriously.How capable would a girl that looked about twenty years old be?However, just as someone reached out and wanted to cup a hand over Pei Yunge\u2019s mouth and nose, another hand moved faster and grabbed his collar in the next second!It was immediate, not letting others have the time to react! That fair and slender hand simply pulled ruthlessly!And that tall man had no choice but to bend his back and stare up at Pei Yunge with difficulty.\u201cY-You\u2026\u201dThe man\u2019s face was filled with shock and fear. However, he couldn\u2019t get out of her grip no matter what! And the rest of the hooligans by their sides were so shocked they didn\u2019t even dare to take another step forward.\u201cStupid morons! What are you dazing out for? Why aren\u2019t you going up and grabbing her?! Get her off!\u201d Young Master Ling\u2019s face contorted in anger.Hearing this, the men\u2019s eyes flashed with vicious ruthlessness once more as they rushed towards Pei Yunge!Spinning into action, Pei Yunge released her grip and quickly kicked the tall man\u2019s abdomen! He growled out painfully as his body fell backwards uncontrollably.Several of the men rushing forward weren\u2019t careful and were almost knocked down by the man.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With a few twists, she tied her hair into a ponytail. Her pretty eyes were filled with an insuppressible arrogance and imprudence.\u201cYou\u2019re shouting already?\u201dInstantly, everyone felt the thick tension in this atmosphere. Yet, they didn\u2019t know how to deal with something like this. Usually, they had never failed when they circled and intercepted those girls! Not to mention experiencing such an extreme situation!\u201cLet me tell you, I am the young master of the Ling family. If you dare to continue messing about, do you believe that I will make sure you can\u2019t continue living here anymore?!\u201dYoung Master Ling\u2019s words were fierce, yet his heart was diffident as well.Heh. Pei Yunge ignored him and walked straight towards them instead.\u201cYou bunch of u-useless things! Why aren\u2019t you hurrying to protect me?!\u201d Young Master Ling growled angrily as his eyes widened.Who was the one who helped them to live in the lap of luxury usually? Yet they couldn\u2019t even defeat a woman in a fight now?!Instigated by him, someone gritted their teeth. \u201cLet\u2019s go together!\u201dHearing that, one of them silently took out a small knife from the back of his waist. His eyes were filled with a chilling coldness!With that, just as the crowd was about to swarm forward together, he rushed forward and raised the dagger straight away, slashing at Pei Yunge\u2019s face!Originally, it would be very difficult for the girl to react speedily at this angle!However, who knew that Pei Yunge would turn her head and grab his hand!Crack!In the next second, a crisp bone cracking sound made the scalps of everyone present turn numb! With it also came a terrible cry.\u201cArghh!!!\u201dPei Yunge caught the falling knife easily as she suddenly smirked and laughed.\u201cYou all are quite good at gifting heads.\u201dHowever, to the rest of them, this scene made it difficult for them to breathe suddenly as chills ran down their spines!H-Help!This person in front of them was definitely a devil!\u201cLet me tell you, I know the owner of this bar too! If you dare do anything to me, you definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to walk out of this bar!\u201d Caught in a fire situation, Young Master Ling threatened her with a fierce expression. However, his legs had already lost so much energy that he couldn\u2019t stand straight anymore.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)To be honest, he was also afraid that this woman would play with him ruthlessly. His mind and heart was in a turmoil.Was no one really coming to save him?\u2026Just at that moment, several bodyguards appeared at the start of the long corridor.\u201cYoung Master Ling, Master Du asked you to wait in the private room.\u201dFinally! A savior had come! Hearing this, Young Master Ling turned back instantly and stared at them blankly. \u201cM-Master Du?\u201d1\u201cYes.\u201dThe bodyguard nodded expressionlessly.To be frank, Master Du\u2019s original words was that Ling Zhixuan could not leave the private room before he found the person he wanted.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll return right now!\u201dEven if he had to crawl, he would still crawl back!Young Master Ling had just stood up when a glint of darkness flashed in his eyes. He suddenly spat out callously, \u201cThis woman was about to attack me. Since Master Du got you to come look for me, can you help me settle her?\u201dWith that said, a glint of silent gloating flashed in Young Master Ling\u2019s eyes as he stared coldly at Pei Yunge. He would definitely get revenge from this senseless and daring woman.The bodyguards heard his words and they finally noticed Pei Yunge, who was beside them.\u201cMiss, you are?\u201dThe bodyguards suddenly remembered that Master Du was asking everyone in the bar to look for a girl called Pei Yunge earlier.\u201cIs it Huo Shidu?\u201d she suddenly asked.Hearing this, the bodyguards froze. They had a weird feeling that there was a high chance the person Master Du was finding was right before them\u2026\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen you can take him away.\u201d Pei Yunge was willing to let him go as well.\u201cMiss, what is your name?\u201d The bodyguards couldn\u2019t help but ask.Seeing this, Ling Zhixuan couldn\u2019t help but interrupt, \u201cThis woman almost killed me.

However, she never expected what happened next to happen.1Before she could leave the dark corridor, she saw the handsome and dignified man walking over, their eyes meeting.Pei Yunge did not know what to say.To think she was even caught right in action. Not quite knowing why, she had a feeling in her gut that it didn\u2019t seem too good to bump into this man in the bar.Huo Shidu\u2019s eyes were dark and rich as his expression was unreadable.\u201cMaster Du\u2026\u201d Ling Zhixuan was filled with happiness.However, before he could speak, he saw the man chuckle once before his slender legs under the suit pants strode over to stop in front of the girl.At the same time, his well-defined hand stretched out of his pocket lazily and he rapped her forehead softly, like a punishment. \u201cWho allowed you to come here, young lady?\u201d1This scene made everyone else extremely shocked!Master Du knew this girl?!Instantly, the underlings following Ling Zhixuan couldn\u2019t help but shiver from fear. If Master Du found out what thoughts they had for this girl earlier\u2026\u201cI\u2019m already nineteen,\u201d Pei Yunge retorted instinctively.\u201cAre you in university already?\u201d the man asked slowly, looking down with his pale-colored pupils.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was only now that Pei Yunge finally digested the fact that she had repeated a year in school.Huo Shidu\u2019s gaze moved past Ling Zhixuan and the rest of the group casually. After a while, Pei Yunge heard a voice ring from above her head. It was low and magnetic, making her ears itch a little.\u201cWait a while first. Older brother will settle some things.\u201d1\u2026In the private room.Ling Zhixuan swallowed a mouthful of saliva as he knelt beside the sofa with weak legs. He had long been sober. Now he was currently waiting for that person to deal with him personally.He had never thought that this woman would have a relationship with Master Du!If not, he would never dare to do anything no matter what anyone said!(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)1Not too long later, the doors of the private room opened and a strong white shadow appeared before his eyes.With that, what entered his vision was a tall and slender figure. The dignified man dressed in a shirt and suit pants walked unhurriedly towards him.With calmness and composure, Huo Shidu stared at Ling Zhixuan, who was kneeling in front of him with his face filled with fear.\u201cMaster Du, I really didn\u2019t know that she was yours! I-If I knew, I definitely wouldn\u2019t think of touching her. I\u2026\u201d1Ling Zhixuan hurriedly looked up and explained as he panicked. However, he watched as the tall and relaxed man before him calmly lifted a hand. Then the man flicked cigarette ash towards his head.Ling Zhixuan didn\u2019t dare dodge, letting the man use his head as an ashtray.Huo Shidu said carelessly, \u201cOh? You wanted to touch her?\u201dHearing this, Ling Zhixuan felt like his guts would explode from the amount of fear he was feeling.He shook his head crazily, his voice sounding both shaky and pitiful. \u201cMaster Du, I w-wouldn\u2019t dare to! Please give me a chance because of my father? I promise I will walk the other way when I see that lady the next time!\u201dAt that moment, the atmosphere was so tight that it felt suffocating. All he felt was fear!\u201cYou\u2019re considered lucky that the young lady is still waiting outside.\u201dHuo Shidu\u2019s words made Ling Zhixuan freeze for a second before he let out a breath of relief. Perhaps it was because of the earlier tension, his body felt completely exhausted.However, in the next second, as the man exhaled smoke that filled the room, the end of the cigarette shone red as he bit on the cigarette with a casual expression.The smell smelt slightly cold and choking.With that, his fingers held onto the cigarette loosely before he suddenly lifted his hand and pressed the burning cigarette head against Ling Zhixuan\u2019s shoulder.Instantly, the scorching temperature burned his skin straight away!A burning smell filled the room.\u201cAh!\u201dA painful cry that resounded in the private room made one\u2019s scalp urntur numb.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Somehow, she fell into her thoughts almost unconsciously. There seemed to be something strange with this.She was indeed glad to leave with him.Then she wouldn\u2019t have to face that annoying family anymore.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)However, this man didn\u2019t seem like he liked trouble.\u201cI will just stay with you for a few days while I wait for the dormitory application to be approved. I won\u2019t give you any trouble.\u201d After a second, she added, \u201cI can pay you rent according to the market rate.\u201dThe handsome and dignified man narrowed his eyes as he wore a half-smirk. \u201cDo you think Older Brother\u2019s house is a hotel?\u201d\u201c\u2026No.\u201dCaught unexpectedly, Pei Yunge had yet to think of what else to say when she heard his words.\u201cHow long has it been since you slept?\u201dWhen Huo Shidu stared at her red eyes from staying up all night, the first thought in his mind was that it was similar to the eyes of a rabbit.\u201cI can\u2019t remember.\u201d Pei Yunge was used to it as well.In her previous life, she often had insomnia and dreamed often. The doctor said that the capacity of her brain was too large and it was relatively easier to harm her health. If she continued that way, she wouldn\u2019t be able to live long.However, Pei Yunge felt that living till her forties or fifties was enough for her.\u201cWe\u2019re caught in some traffic, so you should sleep for a while in the car first.\u201dHearing his words, Pei Yunge hummed casually in response, not believing that she would be able to fall asleep. However, before she could close her eyes, she heard the man\u2019s pleasant low voice.\u201cCome over, Yunyun.\u201dIt was probably the first time Pei Yunge heard someone address her like that, and her mind blanked out for a moment.However, the man wasn\u2019t in a hurry either. He merely smirked his thin, red lips as he patted his long legs that looked extremely straight and strong in his black suit pants.\u201cOlder Brother will let you rest on me.\u201dPei Yunge\u2019s eyelid twitched and she laughed.\u201cThat\u2019s not too appropriate\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s not appropriate about it? It\u2019s fine as long as you don\u2019t take advantage of Older Brother.\u201d the man said with a smirk as the corners of his pale-colored eyes curled up.2\u201c\u2026\u201dSeeing that Huo Shidu was staring straight at her, Pei Yunge lost whatever mental burden she had and scooted over, placing her head on top of the man\u2019s muscular thigh.However, even though Pei Yunge had planned to merely pretend to sleep, when she smelt the faint and pleasant, cooling scent on Huo Shidu, sleepiness seemed to hold onto her for the first time.Somehow, her pretty, but red eyes slowly closed as well.Seeing her start to drift off, a hard-to-detect glint of humor flashed in the man\u2019s eyes. He suddenly remembered something and took out his phone, then sent a message to someone.[I\u2019ve found her. I\u2019ll bring her back first.]Once the message was sent, Huo Shidu threw his phone to the side casually.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even now, he couldn\u2019t understand why he decided to take her home.When they first met, all he thought was that this was a pitiful little kitten. One that acted obediently yet liked to scratch others too.Indeed, she was interesting. But he never thought anything would grow between them. However, once he was done dealing with that Ling person, his thought had somehow changed.This young lady was too beautiful. If the Qin family couldn\u2019t look after her properly, she would definitely meet bad people and go down the wrong path eventually.The darkness in Huo Shidu\u2019s eyes disappeared as the corners of his lips curled up.Never mind.With an index finger on her cheek, he brushed it against it, a gentle caress.\u201cGood night, Yunyun.\u201d\u2026In the bar.Qin Lang was still searching for his younger sister as his heart was heightened with unease and panic.It was at this time that Qin Yu called him.\u201cHow is it? Did you manage to contact your friend?\u201d Qin Lang asked impatiently.\u201cHe\u2019s already taken her,\u201d Qin Yu said before he added, \u201cIt\u2019s that person I told you about before.\u201d\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Qin Lang asked immediately.\u201cI think they just left\u2026\u201dBefore Qin Yu could finish speaking, Qin Lang burst out of the bar with a tight grip on his phone.\u201cMr Qin? Where are you going?\u201dEven though Qin Lang heard the voice behind him, he didn\u2019t turn back and ran straight out of the bar instead.It was only when he saw a Lincoln limousine drive away that the glimmer in his eyes flickered slightly. The man\u2019s usually arrogant-looking short, silver hair was drenched, sticking slightly haggardly to his face as raindrops fell on his cheek.His slightly red eyes stared into the distance where the vehicle had disappeared towards.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)His fists were clenched tightly.Thump. The feeling in his heart was one that was empty and at the same time, wrenching in pain.\u2026Once they arrived at the destination, the car doors opened and the warmth inside was invaded by the freezing cold raindrops outside.It was then that Pei Yunge finally woke up, her eyes bleary and mind fuzzy. As she rubbed the slumber out of her eyes, it was only after a while that she gradually regained her senses.What\u2026 Did she just fall asleep?\u201cAre you awake?\u201dHuo Shidu didn\u2019t think that Pei Yunge would wake up so quickly. Judging from her appearance, she probably hadn\u2019t slept for several days now.\u201cMm.\u201dPei Yunge hadn\u2019t organized her words properly before she asked without thinking, \u201cDoes Older Brother sleep alone?\u201dOnce she finished asking what she wanted, Pei Yunge suddenly felt that her words sounded rather ambiguous. However, the prospects of having a peaceful sleep was way too attractive to Pei Yunge.At this moment, Huo Shidu was somewhat taken aback. He probably didn\u2019t think that this young lady would be this direct either.The man\u2019s eyes darkened as mischief flashed in them. His lazy drawl seemed to be lengthened on purpose.\u201cYunyun, you\u2019re an adult too. You have to hold on more when it comes to Older Brother.\u201d2\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter they entered Huo Shidu\u2019s villa, Pei Yunge finally realized that this was at least twice the size of the Qin family.However, the interior style was simple and refined. From the facade of the walls to the overall arrangement of the interior space, everything made one feel comfortable.\u201cWhere\u2019s Er\u2026 Alas?\u201dAs soon as she asked, she realized that Huo Shidu was on a call.\u201cHe\u2019s at the Old Mansion with Xiao Mo,\u201d he responded, before instructing the person on the other end of the call, \u201cMake some sober-up tea and bring it over.\u201d\u2026After he hung up, he glanced towards Pei Yunge. \u201cGo and sleep after having the sober-up tea. You\u2019re not allowed to go to a bar again.\u201d\u201cMm, okay,\u201d Pei Yunge agreed absent-mindedly as she thought about what she had to do in order to stay by Huo Shidu\u2019s side longer. The nap she had in the car earlier, was probably her first peaceful sleep she had had in the past dozen years.And it was all because of this man in front of her.\u2026Not too long after, an elderly servant walked into the living room with a cup of sober-up tea. When she saw Pei Yunge, her expression morphed into an unusual expression, almost one of bewilderment.\u201cAuntie, is this for me?\u201dAs she asked, Pei Yunge was sitting on the sofa with her cheeks resting between her hands, her eyes curled up in a smile.\u201cI believe so\u2026\u201dWhen the servant regained her senses, she hurriedly passed the sober-up tea to Pei Yunge. \u201cThis sober-up tea does not taste too bad.

She looked really smart and soulful. To be honest, she was a lot more likable than all those ladies the Old Madam chose.\u201cAunt Miao, I\u2019m Pei Yunge. You can call me Yunge.\u201dAunt Miao immediately shook her head. \u201cOf course not, I cannot ignore the rules. I will call you Young Miss Yunge.\u201dHearing this, Pei Yunge didn\u2019t push further. On the other hand, Aunt Miao never thought that Master Du would bring a girl home. She had to quickly report it to the Old Madam!\u2026The next day.Hengde, Senior Second Year, Class Seven.The teacher on the podium was furious. \u201cLu Yuansi, are you lacking manners more and more now? You didn\u2019t wear your uniform and didn\u2019t bring your homework either?\u201d1In the face of the teacher\u2019s ire and rampant spittle, Lu Yuansi didn\u2019t appear to care too much and looked out of the door instead, wondering why that person hadn\u2019t come yet today.\u201cDid you hear me talking to you?! Is there a student more arrogant than you in this school?\u201d2The moment the teacher finished speaking, impatience flashed in Lu Yuansi\u2019s eyes as he turned around, about to speak.However, he heard a voice at the door.\u201cReport.\u201dSuddenly, everyones\u2019 eyes were fixated at the entrance of the room.All they saw was a girl with black hair, red lips and fair skin, dressed in the school uniform standing lazily outside. Her beautiful eyes were enough to make one\u2019s heart itch.However, the focus of the teacher was always sharp and strict.\u201cTransfer student?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe teacher sucked in a deep breath. \u201cWhere is your school bag?\u201d(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)Pei Yunge thought for a while before she said honestly, \u201cI forgot to bring it.\u201dEveryone was speechless.The person before didn\u2019t bring his homework or wear the school uniform and this one didn\u2019t even bring her school bag when she came to school.3What did these two think school was for? One was wilder than the other.Since Pei Yunge\u2019s school bag was still in the Qin family, indeed, she couldn\u2019t go and retrieve it so early in the morning. However, she couldn\u2019t be bothered to explain so much either.\u201cAlright! I see why Class Seven is indeed the last class!\u201d The teacher\u2019s roar of rage was enough to scorch the classroom.\u201cTeacher, how can a transfer student represent our class?\u201d Ling Jiwei, who had a feud with Pei Yunge before, laughed viciously. \u201cCan we stop the school from placing just anyone into our class?\u201d\u201cYeah. I heard from before that the school culture of that Jiangpu district high school isn\u2019t too good. Their undergraduate admission rate isn\u2019t even at 40%,\u201d another girl continued snidely, her tone arrogant and superior.They never respected those students who had bad results and bad family backgrounds.So what if Pei Yunge has some relations to the Qin family?Was her surname Qin? She was merely a poor relative of Qin Youjiao. Who was she to act up in front of them?\u201cDo you think you can get into an undergraduate course if it wasn\u2019t for your parents\u2019 excellent resources?\u201d the physics teacher asked, face void of any emotion.2Instantly, they were rendered speechless and had no choice but to shut up. This physics teacher had always looked only at their results and didn\u2019t care how wealthy a student\u2019s family was.\u201cThe both of you, copy the key points in the physics book three times respectively after school! Give them to me by this week!\u201dIt was obvious that the physics teacher was furious. In his many years of teaching, he had never seen such disobedient and unruly students before!\u201cAlright.\u201dAfter hearing Pei Yunge agree to it, Lu Yuansi had no choice but to nod briefly with furrowed eyebrows. However, it was only after that that the physics teacher realized that these two frustrating students were deskmates.Lu Yuansi forgot to bring the physics book while the other didn\u2019t even bring anything. They couldn\u2019t even share the textbook!At that moment, the physics teacher had to force himself to take in several deep breaths before he could even face them peacefully.\u201cFind someone to share the book with.\u201dWith that said, a friend that Lu Yuansi hung out with quickly called him over to share the book.

His face was chubby, though his eyes weren\u2019t small and he had a tall nose bridge as well. In his clean and tidy school uniform, he looked fair and tender, one couldn\u2019t have a bad impression of him at all.\u201cIt sounds quite nice.\u201d Pei Yunge smirked as she replied, before she introduced herself, \u201cI\u2019m Pei Yunge.\u201dChu Zhixing froze for a second as something in his heart somehow felt touched. His eyes watered a little.It was obvious that Pei Yunge knew that he knew her name, but this was just a self-introduction out of respect. He had barely ever encountered such equal and respectful treatment in the past few years.This person that looked arrogant and unruly in front of him had actually become the first person to view him equally.Chu Zhixing hid the darkness in his eyes.At the same time, Ling Jiwei, who was prepared to watch Pei Yunge embarrass herself, was wearing a terrible expression as she glared ruthlessly at Chu Zhixing, as a cold smile appeared on her lips.This damned fatty actually dared to interfere in her matters.Last night, she had already messaged the class privately and warned everyone to not be nice to Pei Yunge. She never thought that there will still be someone who dared to poke their finger into this without fear of death!\u2026After class.Someone came to tell her that her school bag had been sent to the security room and for her to go collect it.However, what was unexpected was that Pei Yunge had just returned from retrieving her school bag when she bumped into Lu Yuansi.\u201cDon\u2019t get too close to Chu Zhixing. He\u2019s problematic.\u201dAs he said this, Lu Yuansi\u2019s eyebrows were furrowed. In the past, he had seen Chu Zhixing sneakily inject medicine into himself in the bathroom.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)3Although it didn\u2019t seem like those illegal drugs, it was really like what the rumors said \u2013 Chu Zhixing was a monster.3\u201cReally?\u201dPei Yunge raised an eyebrow slightly. Her eyes were cast into a bright smile, yet no one knew what she was thinking. Seeing this, Lu Yuansi wanted to continue speaking, though he stopped himself.Was he crazy?Why was he telling Pei Yunge what to do?This woman wouldn\u2019t listen to him.\u201cWhatever.\u201d Lu Yuansi\u2019s face was void of any emotion before he left.\u2026At noon.As Pei Yunge was done getting some water in the long corridor, she was about to return to the classroom. However, she suddenly heard a painful whimper from the corner.\u201cYou damn fatty, you even dare to put your finger into my business, huh?\u201dIt was Ling Jiwei\u2019s voice, sounding both sharp and mean. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you act so courageously before, and now you\u2019ve learned how to act as a hero to save a beauty? Is that what this is?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t hard to deduce who was getting beaten up. At that point, Pei Yunge halted her steps and turned into the corner speedily.It was a dead-end which wasn\u2019t captured by the CCTV.The chubby boy was covered in dirty water from head to toe. Apart from Ling Jiwei and another girl, there were even several boys kicking at Chu Zhixing with all their strength. They looked tall and lanky and as they crowded around the chubby boy, they looked every part like legitimate gangsters.2\u201cL-Let me off\u2026\u201dThe chubby boy\u2019s face was exceptionally pale, as if he was experiencing a kind of pain. His eyebrows were furrowed as cold sweat drenched his forehead.\u201cOh? Let you off? Sure! Son, how about you kneel down and admit your mistake to Father, and I\u2019ll let you off?\u201dA boy, who was as thin as a monkey, snickered as he intentionally humiliated the other. As he did so, he didn\u2019t forget to kick Chu Zhixing once more.Chu Zhixing was in so much pain his whole body was trembling.\u201cGod, look at this fat pig.

You still dare to come? I haven\u2019t looked for you to settle our feud from before.\u201dLing Jiwei smiled coldly and darkly.\u201cYou\u2019re the person that bullied Weiwei?\u201d The malicious eyes of the boy who appeared to lead the group landed on Pei Yunge.So this was the so-called transfer student. She was indeed pretty. Even Qin Youjiao couldn\u2019t compare to her.Pei Yunge side-stepped him and walked towards Chu Zhixing, before she glanced at him. He looked terrible from head to toe.\u201cWho did it?\u201d Pei Yunge asked calmly, as if she was asking about the weather.\u201cLittle girl, you don\u2019t have to care about Senior\u2019s matters.\u201dThe boy had a hand in his pocket while his other hand was still holding onto the camera.

With a light tap of her finger, she opened his photo gallery.There were all sorts of videos in there. The videos didn\u2019t only belong to Chu Zhixing, there were others too.\u201cYou\u2019re quite good at playing.\u201dWith that, Pei Yunge\u2019s pretty eyes curled up as a darkness in her eyes seemed to grow, bit by bit. Yet, she still looked extremely pretty when she smiled.The boy, who didn\u2019t seem to notice anything, happened to see Pei Yunge\u2019s smile and his heart itched. Just as he was about to reach out and place his hand on Pei Yunge\u2019s shoulder\u2026\u2026Bam! A loud sound of the phone landing on the floor rang in the next second. Before the boy could realize what happened, he saw Pei Yunge step on the now-useless phone carelessly.The loud crack of the phone made everyone freeze.1\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201dThe boy\u2019s face darkened in an instant.\u201cWho did you want to kneel down earlier?\u201d Pei Yunge asked.The boy\u2019s expression slowly distorted as he laughed coldly, \u201cOh? So you want to tell me what to do?\u201d\u201cKneel.\u201dAs Pei Yunge looked up, her eyes flashed towards Chu Zhixing beside her. \u201cOf course, someone will have to kneel.\u201d\u201cAre you afraid now? I just bought that phone and you dare to break it for me. Even if you want to\u2026\u201dThe boy gritted his teeth, not even having the time to finish speaking when the girl in front of her smiled brightly and smashed the glass cup in her hand on the floor!The glass shattered into pieces, making everyone\u2019s heart tremble from fear!\u201cWhat are you in a rush for? No one will miss out today.\u201d As she said this, Pei Yunge licked her red lips, a mocking smirk on her face. Her pair of dark-colored eyes sparkled under the sunlight, yet they made one feel shivers creeping down their spines.Even Ling Jiwei took a few steps back from fear instinctively!However, the boy couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud as he stared at the girl whose wrist was so thin it was as if it would snap apart with just a twist.\u201cLittle girl, you think you\u2019re so capable?\u201dWhen he was done laughing, he stared at Pei Yunge with disdain. \u201cWeiwei, just stand at the side and watch how Brother Qian can help you vent your anger.\u201dHearing this, Ling Jiwei\u2019s expression eased a little too.\u201cBrother Qian, don\u2019t worry.

Seeing so, Ling Jiwei and the rest instantly escaped as quickly as their legs could take them.However, Pei Yunge didn\u2019t have time to care about them at this moment.\u201cI\u2026\u201dChu Zhixing\u2019s eyes sparkled as his pale lips moved, wanting to say something but did not. He didn\u2019t want Pei Yunge to think that he was a monster too.\u201cDo you need your medication? An injection syringe?\u201dHearing this, Chu Zhixing froze up completely.Actually, Pei Yunge noticed from her very first glance that there were several injection marks on the inside of Chu Zhixing\u2019s arm.\u201cI\u2019ll send you to the infirmary first.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dChu Zhixing\u2019s voice was hoarse as he hurriedly looked down, not daring to see what type of eyes Pei Yunge was looking at him with. Even his own biological mother stayed far away from fear when his illness acted up.So he held on with gritted teeth, yet his eyes were filled with redness. His voice was so suppressed that it was trembling. \u201cI\u2026 I just need to rest for a while.\u201dSuddenly, Pei Yunge\u2019s lazy voice rang. \u201cDo you want me to kick you a few times to wake yourself up?\u201dChu Zhixing was speechless.\u201cTake treatment if you\u2019re ill, got it? Who doesn\u2019t have some kind of illness or pain?\u201d2Chu Zhixing froze for a second before he turned to look at Pei Yunge on instinct.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)However, the teenage girl in front of him only had the usual indolent lack of care on her expression. If there was one additional thing, it would be the slight annoyance she had.She didn\u2019t wear the fear and judgement he saw from others and didn\u2019t treat him as a monster.However, her annoyance was real. She intended to have a teleconference with the people in the computing institute.Now, she had stood them up.\u201cYour temper is really good.\u201d Chu Zhixing muttered as he looked down.\u201c\u2026\u201dPei Yunge\u2019s eyelids twitched. \u201cCan you get up?\u201d\u201cI-I can!\u201dChu Zhixing nodded like a bird pecking as he forced himself up, only to almost collapse again.Ignoring his silent protest, Pei Yunge moved to help him a little. As she did this, she fell into contemplation. She would have had to be stupid if she didn\u2019t know that she was the cause for all of this.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dChu Zhixing\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t too good. However, when he regained his senses, he hurriedly shook his head.\u201cI lent the book to you willingly. You didn\u2019t force me to.\u201dPei Yunge glanced at him.After a while, just as Chu Zhixing thought that Pei Yunge didn\u2019t want to speak anymore, he heard her say, \u201cIf there\u2019s anything next time, you can look for me.\u201dHearing this, Chu Zhixing\u2019s eyes watered immediately. He gritted his teeth as he glanced towards her with careful but hopeful eyes.\u201cIn the future, can I follow you?\u201d3\u2026In the infirmary.Pei Yunge had just sent a message to the computing institute when she arrived at the door.\u201cStudent, did you bring Student Chu here?\u201dThe infirmary teacher was a young woman with a neat fringe. She looked gentle and cute and wore spectacles that didn\u2019t look imposing at all.\u201cMm,\u201d Pei Yunge then asked, \u201cTeacher, how\u2019s Chu Zhixing?\u201d\u201cHis condition is very serious. It\u2019s a good thing you sent him here in time.\u201dThe infirmary teacher was helpless. \u201cThis child is actually quite pitiful too. He gets bullied every other day.\u201d\u201cDoes he always have to inject his medication?\u201d\u201cYes, I believe that\u2019s the case. He rarely comes to the infirmary, he\u2019s too afraid of being seen.\u201dHmm\u2026 Pei Yunge fell into deep thought.Meanwhile, Chu Zhixing, who was sitting on the medical bed, looked down as he recalled how Pei Yunge had rejected him earlier.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Meanwhile, Pei Yunge looked down quietly, as if she was thinking of something.Chu Zhixing didn\u2019t dare make any noise for the time being.Suddenly, she asked, \u201cDid you want me to protect you?\u201d\u201cN-No! I can become stronger. I can protect Student Pei too\u2026\u201d Towards the end of his sentence, Chu Zhixing\u2019s words became softer and softer.However, hearing so, Pei Yunge\u2019s eyes darkened a little. The corners of her lips slowly curled up as she suddenly asked with interest.\u201cCan you fight?\u201dFight? Chu Zhixing\u2019s body froze as he slowly looked down again.\u201cThen how do you want to protect me?\u201d Pei Yunge chuckled slowly.It wasn\u2019t her first time hearing someone say that they could protect her.But there was still some long lost anticipation.\u2026Back in the classroom.It was only when the class chairman asked Pei Yunge for her\u00a0WeChat1\u00a0to invite her into the class chat that she remembered about this.But when she glanced at the WeChat account the original her had used, she decided to create a new account instead. When she was added to the group chat, Pei Yunge didn\u2019t pay too much attention to it. Instead, she entered a phone number.She found an account with the nickname [Du].Seeing this, the corners of Pei Yunge\u2019s lips curled up slightly before she exited the option to add the account as a friend.Her slender fingers tapped into the option to change her nickname. After some thought, she casually keyed in a new name.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)\u2026Not too long later, in Huo Corporation, the phone on the office table suddenly vibrated.Huo Shidu picked up the phone without even looking up. It was only after he opened the message that his thin eyelids finally glanced upwards.His soft gaze landed on the screen.[Older Brother\u2019s Little Nightingale has requested to add you as a friend.]1A few seconds later, Huo Shidu\u2019s eyes darkened indistinctly as he chuckled lowly.\u201cThe little girl is absolutely lawless.\u201d\u2026In the afternoon.Pei Yunge was indeed called to the office once again.When she pushed the door open and entered the office, she saw a mature and prudent, middle-aged man sitting on the sofa, chatting with the principal.\u201cPrincipal, you asked for me?\u201dWhen Pei Yunge smiled, her eyes sparkled with a sincere sense of clarity. It made it hard for one to think that this was a student that would hit and injure others.\u201cDid you injure Qian Chengjun?\u201d the principal asked with a dark expression.Back then, in order to push this student in, the Qin family had donated a building to Hengde!However, after he heard the random gossip and rumors, he finally found out that this wasn\u2019t an illegitimate daughter of the Qin family or someone who had certain relations or connections like he had expected.This was just a poor relative who relied on the Qin family and forced them to transfer her into the school.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat do your parents do?\u201d asked the middle-aged man dressed in a suit.Pei Yunge raised an eyebrow as she looked at the man. \u201cI grew up in an orphanage.\u201dHearing this, the middle-aged man couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud. It was as if he thought that she was too daring.\u201cThen do you know who Qian Chengjun is? He\u2019s the future heir of the Qian Company. Student Pei, do you know what kind of consequences you have to pay with your actions?\u201d As the middle-aged man laughed, his wrinkles deepened, though his eyes were completely cold.\u201cConsequences?\u201d Pei Yunge asked in return.\u201cYou dared to make my son kneel on glass? I\u2019ll give you two options.\u201d He then narrowed his eyes. \u201cEither you be expelled, or you can go kneel on glass too.\u201d\u201cPresident Qian, this\u2026\u201dThe principal was starting to panic a little too. After all, the Qin family had donated a building\u2026However, once President Qian glared at him, the principal had no choice but to shut up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That rich young master that incapacitated a school mate before he transferred to our school!\u201d The girl sounded really agitated.Qin Youjiao furrowed her eyebrows. \u201cHow is that even possible?\u201dHow could Pei Yunge fight against Qian Chengjun?\u201cIt\u2019s true! Now that Qian Chengjun\u2019s father has come to settle things with her!

What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cMom, I think Pei Yunge got into trouble at school.\u201dAfter Qin Youjiao told everything she heard to Mrs Qin, Mrs Qin fell silent.\u201cHow about you come to school first? I don\u2019t want others to think that you\u2019re not treating your biological daughter well.\u201d Qin Youjiao\u2019s reasoning was obedient and sensible.\u201cJiaojiao, you go back to class first. Mom will think about it.\u201dWith that said, Mrs Qin hung up the call.However, Qin Youjiao laughed. She was sure Mrs Qin would definitely come.Of course, she didn\u2019t do this for Pei Yunge\u2019s sake. She wanted to let Mrs Qin see the difference between Pei Yunge and her.With Mrs Qin\u2019s character, she will only hate and despise Pei Yunge more.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)\u2026In the Qin family old manor.Mrs Qin was on the phone with Mr Qin.Her eyes were completely red as she cried hysterically, \u201cBack then, I already said before not to bring her back and just give her money! Do you see now how embarrassing she is to me?!\u201d1All Mr Qin could do was try to comfort her. \u201cYou should go and take a look first before you say more. I\u2019m at the company now and can\u2019t get away.\u201d\u201cLet me tell you, if she creates any more trouble for the family, I will definitely kick her out!\u201d1With that, Mrs Qin hung up the call as she accidentally saw her reflection in the mirror. Her expression filled with anger and hatred made her freeze for a second.Pursing her lips, she shook her head slightly, before she took her bag and left.\u2026In the Principal\u2019s office.\u201cAre you done thinking? Will you withdraw from the school or will you kneel down?\u201d President Qian asked with a sinister smile as he glowered at her with beady eyes.If he hadn\u2019t seen for himself how badly his son was injured, he would almost think that this was just a prank or joke! It had been so many years, and no one dared to treat his son like this before!\u201cUncle, are you threatening me?\u201dPei Yunge\u2019s pretty eyes curled up. There was no fear at all.President Qian said coldly, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to choose either, then I have no choice but to\u30fc\u201d\u2026Before he could finish speaking, a knock sounded from the door, before it was pushed open.Everyone turned around.No one expected the newcomer to be Mrs Qin.\u201cMrs Qin, why are you here?\u201dThe principal\u2019s eyelid twitched. He didn\u2019t think that Mrs Qin would come herself!Could it be that this poor relative was extremely doted on by the Qin family?!Seeing Pei Yunge\u2019s unconcerned expression, the fire in her belly burned even brighter within Mrs Qin. She suppressed her rash urges and walked forward with a frosty expression before grabbing Pei Yunge\u2019s arm.\u201cPei Yunge, do you not want to study and become a useless piece of trash instead?!\u201dThe temperature in Pei Yunge\u2019s bright eyes slowly dropped.\u201cMrs Qin, please conduct yourself with dignity.\u201d Pei Yunge\u2019s lips were curled up into a half-smile as she slowly pulled the older woman\u2019s hand off of her arm.Seeing the undisciplined girl\u2019s attitude, Mrs Qin couldn\u2019t help but laugh coldly. If this went on, she was going to explode from anger from Pei Yunge\u2019s impenetrable attitude!\u201cMrs Qin?\u201dWhen President Qian saw Mrs Qin, he was surprised as well.Didn\u2019t this student say that she grew up in an orphanage?

The level of doting she had towards Youjiao was even more than the other three brothers combined. Not to mention Pei Yunge, who suddenly appeared in their lives.Therefore, it came as no surprise when Mr Qin proposed to reveal Pei Yunge\u2019s identity, Mrs Qin was the first to oppose it.\u201cI\u2019ve heard about the matter.\u201dMrs Qin took a deep breath and looked at Pei Yunge. Then she said without any expression, \u201cIf it\u2019s true, then let her bear the legal consequences.\u201dEven as she said this, Mrs Qin was staring fixedly at Pei Yunge.She was waiting for Pei Yunge to show weakness.All the while, her hands were shaking.No matter what, this good-for-nothing person was her biological daughter. She would intervene to solve this problem as long as Pei Yunge showed some weakness.But in the future, she would transfer Pei Yunge to another school. How could she let it affect Jiaojiao?At this moment.The door was suddenly kicked open.Qin Lang looked like he had run all the way here, he was panting and his short silver gray hair disheveled.\u201cWhere\u2019s Ge\u2019er!?\u201dQin Lang was called over by the principal and was surprised when he saw Mrs Qin.\u201cMom?\u201dMrs Qin\u2019s expression did not look good. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)The look in Qin Lang\u2019s eyes calmed down gradually. He then went to Pei Yunge and faced President Qian.\u201cDo you have any proof that Ge\u2019er injured your son?\u201dAs he said this, Qin Lang\u2019s tone was sarcastic and his handsome face was full of coldness.\u201cQin Lang, shut up!\u201d Mrs Qin\u2019s expression became darker.

Third Brother will take you back.\u201d\u201cQin Lang, you!\u201d Mrs Qin\u2019s eyes were almost red from glaring at him!However, Pei Yunge did not move and shook away Qin Lang\u2019s hand.\u201cI did it,\u201d Pei Yunge said quietly.Qin Lang\u2019s body stiffened and it took him a while to react. He felt his eyes sting.Ge\u2019er had refused to forgive him.Even if he bore the consequences, Ge\u2019er did not want to be involved with him anymore.\u201cGe\u2019er, don\u2019t be afraid.

As long as this student is willing to apologize to my son and avoid my son in the future when she sees him, I will treat it as if nothing had happened.\u201dMrs Qin\u2019s eyes flashed and she asked coldly, \u201cPei Yunge, do you admit you\u2019re wrong?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201dPei Yunge laughed and the corners of her red lips lifted. \u201cIndeed, there must be someone who must drop out of school because of this.\u201d\u201cGood, good! Pei Yunge, you\u2019re really capable!\u201dMrs Qin was dizzy with anger. How could she have given birth to such a person? Why wasn\u2019t she anything like Jiaojiao?2\u201cMiss Pei, have you thought it through?\u201dA dark look as well as a sneer flashed past President Qian\u2019s eyes. There were not many people who would make such a stupid decision at this time. But it was good that he was able to avenge his son!\u201cOf course.\u201dPei Yunge lowered her eyes and chuckled, tapping her slender index finger on the table.

How long would it take if we had to wait for you to contact us?\u201d\u201cWait\u2026 What do you mean??\u201dPresident Qian suddenly felt that something was wrong. At the same time, Mrs Qin furrowed her eyebrows and subconsciously looked at Pei Yunge. She saw that she looked like she was enjoying the show.\u201cMr Qian, do you remember the matter with your son last year? A case was also made in the station?\u201dThere was a mocking look in the investigator\u2019s eyes. \u201cThere was no evidence found against your son that time. But this time, the videos of your son bullying other students on campus has spread all over the school\u2019s forum page. There are 65 videos in total. Your son really doesn\u2019t do anything good in school.\u201d\u201cHow is that possible!?\u201dPresident Qian\u2019s face paled and his body froze!\u201cIt\u2019s a hot trending topic. How about you have a look along the way.\u201dThe investigator glanced at his watch. \u201cAs his guardian, you must come with us and cooperate with the investigation.\u201dThis was strange.That hot search topic was after the top three, but then suddenly shot up to take the first spot. Later, when they wanted to take it down, so as to not aggravate the mood of the people, the whole list seemed to have an error and could not be moved.As for the school\u2019s forum, even the administrator was not able to delete it. Qian Zhenye must have provoked someone he should not have provoked for this to happen.He was in a difficult situation.1In those videos that were posted, only the victims\u2019 faces were blurred out and Qian Chengjun\u2019s face was so clear that it was hard to deny the accusations.\u201cComrade, is this really not a misunderstanding? The case with my son last year has already been closed!\u201dThe investigator scoffed, his eyes full of coldness. \u201cClosed? That child is still lying in the hospital. Do you think you can give him back his life just by giving him some money?\u201dHearing this, President Qian\u2019s brain was buzzing and his eyes swept over Pei Yunge.

How could he bear for his son to go to jail?The investigator looked at Pei Yunge, who was standing by the side, and could not help but frown.Was Qian Zhenye crazy?Could a high school student have such ability to hack the whole network?\u201cWere you the one who got Qian Chengjun sent to the hospital?\u201dThe investigator picked a more feasible question to ask.\u201cYes.\u201dPei Yunge\u2019s voice was calm and there was a smirk on her red lips.Qian Chengjun\u2019s injury was not serious, and at most, it would be to provide financial compensation.A voice suddenly rang out from the door when the people were still in a daze.\u201cShe hit him because she was helping me!\u201dPei Yunge\u2019s fingertips moved and her charming eyes fell on Chu Zhixing, whose face was red because he had run over.\u201cBoy, do you know what you\u2019re talking about?\u201dPresident Qian\u2019s expression was dark.Clenching his teeth, Chu Zhixing took off his shirt in front of them.

He followed behind her, not too far yet not too close.And Pei Yunge did not look back.Then, just as Chu Zhixing was feeling strange that they had walked to this area, he saw Pei Yunge climb over the two meter high wall and left school.2Chu Zhixing, \u201c??!\u201dTen minutes later.Chu Zhixing, who was trying to climb over the wall, gave up and returned to class.1\u2026Class Seven.\u201cThe matter with Qian Chengjun got too out of hand, right?\u201d\u201cI heard from someone I know that the videos taken by Qian Chengjun have all been released.

She threw the plastic bag in her hand on Chu Zhixing\u2019s desk and went back to her seat.This scene made Lu Yuansi, who had no mood to sleep all afternoon, frown.Even Chu Zhixing was stunned. After opening the plastic bag, he found that there were two bottles of medicinal ointment inside. He lowered his head and his expression could not be seen.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dPei Yunge, who was sitting in front of Chu Zhixing, hummed in reply, and then picked up her pen to scribble the key points of the second year physics class.After seeing this, Lu Yuansi suddenly felt a sense of crisis.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then he took out a piece of paper and pen, and quickly copied the notes as punishment.If Pei Yunge handed in the copied notes and he had not even written a word, the old man would definitely give him a scolding.The people in the class were speechless when they looked at this pair of new deskmates.\u2026When school ended, Pei Yunge was still slowly copying the notes with her cheek resting on her hand.Seeing this, Lu Yuansi could not help but say, \u201cAren\u2019t you going home?\u201dBy now, his hand was numb from copying.Pei Yunge did not lift her head. \u201cIt\u2019s still early.\u201d\u201cS-Student Pei, let me copy some for you.\u201d Chu Zhixing mustered up his courage and stuttered.\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201dPei Yunge\u2019s hand stopped. She put the pen cap back and was ready to go back.At her motions, Lu Yuansi breathed out a sigh of relief. Finally, he did not have to copy anymore.\u201cYou\u2019re not going home?\u201dPei Yunge suddenly asked Chu Zhixing, which made Lu Yuansi frown. Although his deskmate seemed aloof and ignorant, wasn\u2019t she a little too soft-hearted?Chu Zhixing pursed his lips and looked at Pei Yunge, looking hesitant to say something.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be going first.\u201dPei Yunge got ready to leave after saying that.\u201cStudent Pei, are you going home?! I\u2019ll take you\u2026\u201dBefore Chu Zhixing could finish speaking, he heard Pei Yunge say lazily, \u201cI\u2019m going to the bar, do you want to go?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPei Yunge glanced at him with a small smile on her lips. But she had just walked to the school gate when she saw a familiar figure.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)The man was tall and the sleeves of his white shirt were rolled up to his elbows elegantly. The long legs under his pants could make people\u2019s mind thrum with thoughts.His light-colored pupils were sweeping around listlessly, but his eyes were as cool as the moon. The girls passing by lowered their voices and were talking excitedly, all the while unable to stop themselves from staring at him.Pei Yunge\u2019s eyelids twitched.Why was he here?\u201cStudent Pei, what are you looking\u2026\u201dChu Zhixing, who was determined to catch up with Chu Zhixing, saw Pei Yunge standing on the roadside and could not help asking.Before he could finish his question, Pei Yunge pulled him aside\u2026And she hid behind a tree.1\u201cAre you hiding from that person?\u201dChu Zhixing was stunned for a while before he regained his senses.\u201cMm.\u201dPei Yunge replied distractedly, but she was thinking about how she was going to get to the bar to see Yu Manran.\u201cIs that your brother?\u201dChu Zhixing\u2019s eyes were innocent and when he saw that Pei Yunge did not refute, he advised her, \u201cStudent Pei, since your brother has come, you\u2019d better go home with him.\u201d1Hearing this, a dark look flashed past Pei Yunge\u2019s eyes and the corners of her red lips lifted slightly. She looked at him with her beautiful eyes and there was a troubled expression on her face. \u201cActually, I haven\u2019t thought about how to face him.\u201d\u201cDid you have a fight with your brother?\u201d Chu Zhixing asked.\u201cNo, I have a brother complex. You see, my brother looks like that and it\u2019s easy for me to lose control.\u201dAs she said this, Pei Yunge\u2019s clear, cat-like eyes were languid and cynical.But the young and ignorant Chu Zhixing was stunned.Wait a minute, was this what he had imagined?!\u201cChu Zhixing, can you help me get him to go back first?\u201dPei Yunge pouted. \u201cI\u2019ll go back immediately after I have thought it through.

And the moment Chu Zhixing saw Huo Shidu\u2019s face, he almost wanted to support this sister and brother pair.5Wasn\u2019t Student Pei\u2019s brother too good-looking?!What kind of perfect face was this!!?\u201cDo you need something?\u201d Huo Shidu put his cell phone back in his pocket and asked.\u201cI-I\u2019m Pei Yunge\u2019s classmate.

She doesn\u2019t want you and her to hurt each other. So\u2026 so she just wants to calm herself down.\u201d1These words made Huo Shidu give Chu Zhixing another glance and laughed. \u201cHurt each other?\u201d\u201cStudent Pei\u2019s brother, you don\u2019t understand Student Pei\u2019s feelings for you. She really likes you, and it\u2019s not that kind of love between relatives!\u201dAt this point, Chu Zhixing was immersed in his own world and was showing his true feelings. \u201cIf you really want to like this sister, please take good care of her.\u201dHuo Shidu seemed to know what was going on.After a moment, he chuckled.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)Huo Shidu stubbed out the cigarette and threw it away. His upturned eyes were charming and his voice was languid and playful.\u201cWhere is she? I\u2019m going to tell her the good news that she\u2019s adopted.\u201d10Chu Zhixing was shocked when he heard this. It was as if he had been struck by lightning!1For a moment, his brain had shut down.Pei Yunge, who was standing behind the tree, was kicking pebbles in boredom.Suddenly, there was a figure in front of her.Pei Yunge had just looked up and was about to thank Chu Zhixing, but did expect that the person she saw would be Huo Shidu.2She paused for two seconds before asking with a smile, \u201cBrother, why are you here?\u201d1The man\u2019s eyes fell on her.Then he was getting closer and closer.The man\u2019s warm fingertips rubbed her cheek ambiguously, and there was a smirk on his lips. The last syllable he said was seductive, as if it could move the wind by her ear. \u201cMe? I came to feel Yunyun\u2019s feelings for me.\u201dPei Yunge\u2019s body froze.But then she immediately realized that the matter just now might have come to light.\u201cI\u2019m just joking with my classmate. Brother, are you here to pick me up?\u201dPei Yunge\u2019s eyes were curved like crescents, but she was secretly avoiding contact.

Cheng Zihuai was very handsome and attracted the attention of many girls. However, he noticed Pei Yunge when she was about to leave.As soon as he saw her, his eyes turned cold and haughty and he said in a mocking tone, \u201cPei Yunge, I thought you knew how to behave yourself. I didn\u2019t expect you to come looking here.\u201dThis tracking skill made him feel even more impressed than before.Pei Yunge swept her eyes over to the police station opposite and dismissed the idea that was forming in her head.3Then, when Pei Yunge was about to leave, Cheng Zhihuai stepped forward to stop Pei Yunge and looked at her with a cynical look.\u201cPlaying hard to get and making chance encounters? Pei Yunge, did you forget that you\u2019re not a person who likes to come to the bookstore at all?\u201dIn order to attract his attention, this person was really putting in a lot of effort.1Pei Yunge hid the impatience in her eyes, and seeming to think of something, she laughed softly, then raised her charming eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dCheng Zihuai did not know what to say for a moment, seeing Pei Yunge admit it so frankly.Suddenly, Pei Yunge\u2019s gaze turned leisurely to the door and her lips curved. \u201cWho asked me to like the brother outside very much.\u201dHearing this, Cheng Zihuai frowned and thought that Pei Yunge was saying this to him on purpose.\u201cPei Yunge, you don\u2019t have to provoke me on purpose.\u201d His tone was cold and with disdain. \u201cDon\u2019t you know very clearly who I like?\u201dPei Yunge looked at him with her beautiful eyes.\u201cYoung Master Cheng, do you think I\u2019m interested to know what garbage thinks?\u201d1The original protagonist liked Cheng Zihuai and was willing to suffer grievances for him. But based on her temper, she could only send Cheng Zihuai to the garbage dump and let him be garbage.And her words made Cheng Zihuai turn red in the face! He ground his teeth together so hard that sparks almost came out. \u201cPei Yunge!\u201dWas this woman crazy?None of the things she did the past two days were what she dared to do before!\u201cLook in the mirror in the future if you\u2019re that free.\u201d1Pei Yunge enjoyed looking at his angry appearance and said with a smile that did not reach her eyes.She looked at the time and went straight to the coffee bar on the second floor of the bookstore.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)Cheng Zihuai was furious, but then thought of what Pei Yunge had said. \u201cWho asked me to like the brother outside very much.\u201dHe could not help sneering, \u201cI\u2019d like to see what kind of man is outside.\u201d1With that, Cheng Zihuai turned and walked out with a dark expression on his face.There were many passers-by on the road which dazzled people. Just when Cheng Zihuai was sneering at Pei Yunge\u2019s words, he suddenly saw a black Rolls Royce.The man sat by the car window, his well-defined face was particularly outstanding. His posture was lazy, graceful and his noble air could not be hidden.Just when Cheng Zihuai\u2019s body stiffened, Huo Shidu seemed to feel his gaze. There was a trace of oppression in his indifferent eyes, which made Cheng Zihuai even more uncomfortable.Huo Shidu looked away first, and it was obvious he did not take Cheng Zihuai seriously.Regaining his senses, Cheng Zihuai immediately turned away in embarrassment, feeling a sense of inferiority in his heart for the first time.This was the man Pei Yunge had mentioned?!Impossible!Where did Pei Yunge get to know this man!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Taking a deep breath, he left the bookstore with a dark expression.In the car, it was obvious that it was Huo Shidu\u2019s first time waiting for someone, as he had his eyebrows slightly raised while he pulled his tie loose.Who was the little girl meeting to have talked for so long?\u2026In the coffee bar on the second floor of the bookstore.Yu Manran, who had walked in, felt strange. She thought that she would not appear in this place after she had graduated from university.\u201cMiss Pei?\u201dYu Manran found Pei Yunge.\u201cThis is the demo. You can listen to it and can start the arrangement once you feel you\u2019re okay.\u201dWith that, Pei Yunge handed her the wireless earphones.Yu Manran immediately took it and after listening to 40 to 50 seconds of the demo, surprise appeared in her eyes.She could not help looking at Pei Yunge.The talent level of this girl\u2026 Was she only about twenty years old? Her compositions were comparable to those big shots from overseas who had won awards!\u201cMay I ask, who taught Miss Pei this?\u201dThe movement on Pei Yunge\u2019s hand stopped, but returned to normal a moment later.\u201cMy grandfather.\u201dIn her previous life, her grandfather was a famous musician both domestically and overseas. But her grandfather taught her classical music. As for the arrangement of popular music, she learned it when she occasionally helped her friend, who became an artist, to do music arrangement.Yu Manran was envious. \u201cMiss Pei\u2019s grandfather must be a gentle and kind-hearted person, otherwise, how could he have taught you to be so outstanding.\u201dPei Yunge looked up with interest and gave a faint smile. \u201cBecause there is a feather duster placed on top of our piano.\u201dYu Manran was speechless.Was a family that sounded so refined, so down to earth as well?When Pei Yunge was a child, she was someone who refused to correct her errors and was reckless to a fault. But which elder could stand a good-looking and smart child?(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)Especially Pei Yunge, a child who was both mischievous and was a sweet-talker to boot, who always made Grandpa Pei angry with the vexing things she did, but he could not bear to really beat her.1\u2026After a while.Yu Manran decided on this demo, but before she could talk more with Pei Yunge, Pei Yunge\u2019s cell phone vibrated.\u201cMiss Yu, you can head back first.\u201d\u201cYunge, can I add you on WeChat?\u201d Yu Manran asked, a little embarrassed.\u201cSure.\u201dPei Yunge told her series of numbers, and only went to answer the phone call in the aisle of the bookstore after Yu Manran had left.\u201cYunge, your grandfather\u2019s condition has slightly improved. He will be going back to the old manor this Friday,\u201d Mr Qin said before adding, \u201cYour grandfather wants to see you.\u201dIt could be said that the old master was determined to go back to the old manor only to see Pei Yunge. Otherwise, he would not cooperate with the treatment.Last time, when Pei Yunge had been sent to the mental hospital, her grandfather had been livid when he found out after he woke up.\u201cI got it. I\u2019ll go,\u201d Pei Yunge replied calmly.Mr Qin was silent for a moment. \u201cJiaojiao is about to go on her piano recital tour and the media will pay more attention to her family situation. Can you persuade your grandfather to let Jiaojiao stay in the old manor?\u201d1Almost no one outside knew that Qin Youjiao, the eldest young lady of the Qin family, could only stay in a nearby hotel every time she returned to the old manor.One of the times in the past, Mrs Qin had scolded Pei Yunge because of Qin Youjiao and it had made the old master completely disgusted with Qin Youjiao.Pei Yunge lifted her lips into a reckless smile.\u201cDo you think I\u2019m someone to be taken lightly?\u201dThese words made Mr Qin\u2019s expression turn dark and anger gathered in his chest.\u201cDo you know how much Jiaojiao has lost with your return?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He stared at her fixedly and his cheerful and deep laughter floated into her ears.His magnetic and lazy voice sounded. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit too much for me.\u201dPei Yunge did not know what to say.This man was not conducting himself well!\u2026At night.Pei Yunge had just fallen asleep when she was woken up by a dream from before. Her forehead was covered with sweat and the last trace of a flustered look disappearing from her eyes as she gradually woke up.A few minutes later, she got out of bed to wash her face and went to knock on Huo Shidu\u2019s door.The door opened after some time.The man seemed to have just woken up as there was a casual laziness in his cold eyes. He wore a dark-colored robe, the open neckline showing his strong and sexy chest, and the strap of the robe was tied loosely around his waist.\u201cHm?\u201dThe man\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple moved.

When she heard his words, she looked up again.At this moment, Huo Shidu suddenly remembered how Pei Yunge looked when she was sleeping on his legs last time, and seemed to have understood something.His lips curled and he deliberately teased her. \u201cYou can\u2019t sleep and came to me to behave like a hooligan?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat did he mean \u2018hooligan\u2019!For a moment, Pei Yunge was unable to retort and her beautiful eyes moved.Huo Shidu said, \u201cDo you want to try changing rooms with me?\u201dPei Yunge subconsciously looked at him and nodded after she regained her senses.Then, just when Pei Yunge was unguarded, the man pinched her face a little frivolously. He was clearly punishing her somewhat.\u201cYou came knocking on the door dressed like this? Don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t bully people.\u201dHis upturned eyes were charming and his careless appearance made people blush.Dressed like what? Pei Yunge only realized after the man moved his eyes away and left his room.Oh\u2026\u00a0When she looked down at her pajamas, she saw that she had forgotten to button up properly. Reaching to touch her heart, the corners of her lips lifted up. \u201cIt\u2019s really fluttering.\u201dWhen this man flirted, he was really charming.\u2026After entering the room.Pei Yunge could not help but sweep her gaze over at the furnishings around. Just like Huo Shidu\u2019s style, it was simple and clean. There was even red wine on the table under the French windows.It seemed like the man drank it to aid in his sleep.Pei Yunge lay on the bed and the owner\u2019s faint and pleasant scent from the dark gray pillow invaded her nose.It was inexplicably reassuring.Soon, Pei Yunge started to feel the inklings of sleep come to her.But then, someone called her cell phone early in the morning.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why don\u2019t you take him under your wing?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s very rich, I\u2019m not sure if you know him? He\u2019s the successor of the Cheng Corporation, Cheng Zihuai.\u201d1Marcus immediately coaxed her in a flattering manner.Of course, he did not care about money, but he knew that Pei Yunge was short of money.Anyway, no matter whether she would stay in their research institute or not, the big boss could not be provoked. If he could please them, then he would please them first.At this moment, Pei Yunge laughed when she heard this familiar name. She smirked and said in a mocking tone, \u201cTell him to save his breath.\u201dWith that said, Pei Yunge hung up the call.\u2026In the research institute of another country.Beep, beep.Facing a disconnected phone, Marcus was left confused. The big boss\u2019s temper was really hard to understand.\u201cHow was it, how was it? What did the big boss say?\u201d The woman beside him could not suppress her excitement.\u201c\u2026 Big Boss asked him to save his breath.\u201dMarcus\u2019s eyelids twitched as he mused over the meaning behind the words.The women fell silent for a moment before she said, \u201cThen forget it. Anyway, it was to give the big boss a chance to earn money.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dMarcus said worriedly, \u201cBig Boss\u2019s tone just now didn\u2019t seem very good.\u201d(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)\u201cWhy?\u201d The woman was stunned.At this moment, the researcher at the next table laughed. \u201cIn their country, it\u2019s early in the morning now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Oh no.1Marcus glared at him. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say it earlier!\u201d\u2026The next day.Qin Youjiao was practicing the piano in the school\u2019s music room. The smooth and pleasant sound made people\u2019s moods turn better.After Qin Youjiao finished playing, Cheng Zihuai looked at her and asked with a smile.\u201cIs this a new piece?\u201d\u201cYes. What do you think?\u201d QIn Youjiao\u2019s eyes were full of confidence.It had to be said that Qin Youjiao was very talented in this aspect. It was no wonder people said that Qin Youjiao was a talented young pianist.\u201cIt sounds good.\u201dCheng Zihuai smiled and reached out to touch her nose.\u201cZihuai, are you still unhappy because the people from the overseas research institute didn\u2019t accept you?\u201dQin Youjiao saw that his eyes were still a little frosty.\u201cThe people from the research institute said that they have an external researcher in our city. They wanted her to guide me, but she didn\u2019t want to.\u201d1Having been snubbed by this person, Cheng Zihuai was more than a little cold and irritable.He had never suffered a setback in the field of computing. Even the computing teacher he hired thought that he could show his talent in the future.1But that external researcher refused to even give him a chance.\u201cMust it be her?\u201dQin Youjiao\u2019s tone was arrogant and she huffed. \u201cWho does she think she is to look down on people?\u201cIf she is the same age as you, she\u2019s definitely not as talented as you are!\u201d\u201cAccording to the assistant dean, this external researcher is very good, and the institute treats her like a priceless treasure.\u201dA trace of frustration and determination flashed past Cheng Zihuai\u2019s eyes. \u201cI must have her accept me.\u201d1When she heard this, Qin Youjiao said arrogantly, \u201cAll right. But that person will definitely regret that she didn\u2019t accept you at first when she finds out about your talent!\u201dThe gloomy expression on Cheng Zihuai\u2019s face disappeared as he gave her a smile.\u201cHow\u2019s your relationship with your third brother recently?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She opened the social media app and posted an update.[Qin Youjiao: It\u2019s a new piece (cute emoji)]Not long after she had posted it, there were some fans who congratulated her, and some even mentioned Qin Lang.[@CrushQinLang, Our sister is about to start her tour!

I\u2019m jealous.]Seeing these comments, Qin Youjiao could not help smiling and her vanity was satisfied.A mocking look flashed past her eyes.So what if she was the biological daughter? She couldn\u2019t be put on the table and was just useless trash.\u2026At the training base.\u201cBrother Lang, Brother Lang, Look. you and your sister are on the trending topic again!\u201d His teammate said excitedly.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)\u201cMy sister?!\u201dQin Lang\u2019s eyes lit up as soon as he heard it. He grabbed his cell phone and clicked on the trending list.#QinLangQinYoujiao, #QinYoujiaoPianoTour, had been ranked in the top ten of the list.But Qin Lang\u2019s expression darkened when he saw this name.\u201cYou meant her?\u201dHis tone was not good.The teammate was happy when he heard this. \u201cThen Brother Lang, do you have any other sisters?\u201dHearing this, Qin Lang wanted to say something but stopped, the expression on his handsome face darkening even more.He did not mention Qin Youjiao that much, but Qin Youjiao\u2019s popularity had been good without even having a piano recital tour. And he had never tried to cover it up, so he did not care if it was being dug up.But now, Qin Lang realized that all these which originally belonged to Ge\u2019er, had become Qin Youjiao\u2019s.When the thought crossed his mind, it was like a seed that had sprouted and would not give way. Qin Lang\u2019s expression did not look good and he did not explain to his teammates.Instead, he logged into his account that he had not logged in for two years.Glancing at those people who had mentioned him, he could not help laughing.\u2026After a while, the people who had been waiting for Qin Lang\u2019s response finally got to see him posting something.But after seeing it, everyone felt strange.[CrushQinLang: I really want to get out of the blacklist\u2026 (grievance)(grievance)(picture.jpg)]The fans clicked the screenshot of a chat. They found that the alias Qin Lang had given was Ge\u2019er.Qin Lang had sent two messages in succession, but the other party ignored it and there were red exclamation marks on it.[Ge\u2019er, Third Brother is wrong.][(Crying.jpg)]The fans were in an uproar after seeing this post.[Who is Ge\u2019er??][Hahahaha, to think that President Lang would have this day!][Hold on, Crush is this girl\u2019s third brother?? But Qin Youjiao doesn\u2019t have this nickname!]All of a sudden, everyone was aware that there was something going on.Soon after, Mrs Qin called and questioned Qin Lang in a shrill voice, \u201cQin Lang, who asked you to post that chat log!?\u201dIn the face of his mother\u2019s anger, Qin Lang did not care and only laughed. \u201cThey said I dote on Qin Youjiao, so I wanted to clarify it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Qin Lang, do you know how lucky you are to have such a sister!?\u201dHearing this, Qin Lang\u2019s face darkened.But his heart wavered.1It was not because he thought Ge\u2019er was an embarrassment, but because he was afraid that others would compare Ge\u2019er with Qin Youjiao.He did not want Ge\u2019er to be attacked by so many people.After some time.Qin Lang took a deep breath. \u201cMom, you\u2019re the last person who should mention this matter. Aren\u2019t you responsible for Ge\u2019er being like this? You only know that Qin Youjiao pleases you, but how can you not know that this originally belongs to Ge\u2019er? She was not like this before\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying that I\u2019m responsible?!\u201dMrs Qin\u2019s elegant tone became shrill. \u201cDo you think I wanted to take the wrong child?? But why don\u2019t you think about it? Jiaojiao has been my daughter for so many years, but you\u2019re telling me now that I\u2019ve gotten the wrong child, and that a girl that I\u2019ve never met is my daughter!

Cheating in exams and making trouble in school. All she does is disgrace your father and I! I can\u2019t hurt Jiaojiao\u2019s heart because of her.\u201dQin Lang fell silent.When he heard these words, even he felt hurt, let alone Ge\u2019er\u2026He let out a bark of laughter.\u201cFine.\u201dWithout waiting for Mrs Qin to let out a breath, Qin Lang said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t love her, I will. However much you love and dote on Qin Youjiao, I\u2019ll pay it back ten times to Ge\u2019er, and dote on her like a princess.\u201d1\u201cQin\u30fc\u201dAnger gathered in Mrs Qin\u2019s eyes, but before she could finish, Qin Lang hung up.\u2026(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)At the training base.Qin Lang looked at the post and thought for a long time before deleting it. He then clicked on his following list and unfollowed Qin Youjiao.This action made the fans confused![What\u2019s going on? Where was Crush\u2019s post from just now?][F*ck, the 12 people my husband is following turned into 11! Who\u2019s the unlucky one to be unfollowed by my husband!?][Holy crap.

Is Qin Youjiao really the little princess of the Qin family\u2026]Soon after the fans\u2019 comments, Qin Youjiao\u2019s fans began to comment as well.[They\u2019re normal siblings, please don\u2019t overthink anything.][There is only one little princess in the Qin family (rabbit emoji)][It\u2019s just a screenshot and you\u2019re attacking my Jiaojiao?

But there was a thin layer of red being suppressed under her eyes, which made her look like she was not to be trifled with.But these two days, Pei Yunge\u2019s face was radiant, and her bright eyes were even more attractive and charming.Suddenly, he heard the person beside him say calmly, \u201cXiaochu, you have to say something that others don\u2019t know.\u201d3Lu Yuansi was speechless.\u2026After class.The physics teacher was very pleased to receive two neat copied notes. He insisted on taking a copy in each hand and said with a smile, \u201cSee? It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re the school bully or the school belle. The punishment that I, Zhao Yi, give, will never be absent.\u201dLu Yuansi was speechless.Pei Yunge did not know what to say.Everyone knew that Mr Zhao Yi had always been just and stern. However, to everyone\u2019s surprise, Mr Zhao Yi chose Pei Yunge as the representative of this semester\u2019s class.All along, the representative that Mr Zhao Yi chose had the highest score in class.The expression of the girl, who had been the representative of the physics class for a year and a half in a row, changed and she glanced at Pei Yunge with narrowed eyes.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)After class.The girl had a chip on her shoulder and went to Pei Yunge. Then, without waiting for the girl to see clearly, Pei Yunge stuffed the iPad back into the drawer.The girl held down the dark look in her eyes and said with a fake smile, \u201cStudent Pei, if I have any questions on physics in the future, can I ask you for advice?\u201dActually, everyone could probably guess the results of Pei Yunge. She came from the worst high school in the city. It would already be good if she could keep up in their school.Yet she still wanted to be the top student??She must be dreaming.So of course she had asked Pei Yunge this on purpose.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dPei Yunge lifted the corners of her lips and looked at the girl calmly.In response, the girl unconsciously met Pei Yunge\u2019s eyes and her body froze. It was as if all of her thoughts were seen by the person in front of her.\u201cI\u2026\u201dThe girl felt a chill on her back.At this moment, Pei Yunge had picked up the extra-curricular book with the iPad in it, laughed and walked out of the classroom.She did not have time to waste on arguing with a high school student.\u2026It was only after Pei Yunge left that Ling Jiwei dared to go to the girl\u2019s side.With a tone filled with sarcasm, she sneered, \u201cLingling, we\u2019re not the same as her. She cheated in the end-of-term exams and used her connections with Youjiao\u2019s family to come to our class. She won\u2019t be able to climb up our circle after she enters society in the future.\u201d\u2026At the end of the corridor.Pei Yunge found it troubling to type, so she called Marcus directly.\u201cMiss Pei, why did you call me?\u201dMarcus could hardly suppress his excitement.\u201cYou said that you have connections with the medical institute in your country?\u201d\u201cYes, we often get together!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You\u2019ll know when you see the hairlines of the people in their institute, hahaha.\u201d Marcus touched his thick short hair and could not help gloating.\u201cAre there any neurologists?\u201d Pei Yunge asked.The grandfather of the original protagonist had a brain tumor. Although she was not the original protagonist, she was now living as the protagonist, so she would find a way to make up for the protagonist\u2019s regrets.\u201cOf course, the neurologist who won the highest medical prize before is from their institute.\u201dAfter speaking, Marcus could not help asking, \u201cBut that fellow only does ten surgeries a year, and no one has been able to break his rules.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dWhen Marcus heard this, he said with a smile, \u201cThis guy is a madman. He is mad about research and doesn\u2019t like to repeat the same operations.\u201c\u2026By the way, Miss Pei, you know something about medicine?\u201dThere was a lot of medical knowledge in the thesis Pei Yunge submitted. Even the people from the medical research institute next door felt that she was someone amazing.\u201cI learned a little in university. Can you help me send the thing I gave you the other time to that neurologist? This is a project that can be implemented. If he is interested, I can send him the follow-up at any time.\u201dIn her previous life, Pei Yunge was deeply influenced by the physics and computing field because of her mother.So when she was in the gifted class, she took biomedical engineering as an additional module. Using computing technology, she had developed a medical testing machine, which had been widely used in many hospitals.Marcus sucked in a breath and found that he had really dug up a treasure!Follow-up at any time?Didn\u2019t that mean that the trial was successful?!It took a few moments for him to calm down. \u201cOkay, Miss Pei, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll pass it on for you.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dPei Yunge\u2019s lips curved.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me. This is what I should do!\u201d Marcus was overjoyed to have a talent in the institute.It was just a pity that this big boss did not plan to immigrate.\u2026(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)After the end of their conversation.Pei Yunge had just hung up the call and was about to leave when she saw Cheng Zihuai.Originally, Cheng Zihuai had come to find Qin Youjiao and did not expect to meet Pei Yunge at the corridor. He subconsciously glanced at the book in her hand.It was an English book about computers.A trace of derision appeared in Cheng Zihuai\u2019s eyes. She still said that she did not have any ulterior motive towards him?Pei Yunge knew that he was interested in computer science. If it was not because of him, could she understand such obscure professional books?\u201cPei Yunge, you\u2019re still pretending in front of me? Just stop. Even I can\u2019t understand the book in your hand.\u201d Cheng Zihuai sneered as he looked at her.Look what the cat brought in. Pei Yunge\u2019s lips lifted into a faint smile and she looked at Cheng Zihuai. He wanted her to guide him with him being at this level?Pei Yunge laughed. \u201cDo you need to specifically expose your IQ?\u201d1When he heard her words, Cheng Zihuai\u2019s expression darkened.No wonder the Qin family had always looked down on her. As the biological daughter of the Qin family, Pei Yunge was nothing like Qin Youjiao.This girl was just a fraud.Cheng Zihuai\u2019s expression gradually returned to normal and he straightened his sleeves, saying coldly with a smirk, \u201cPei Yunge, no man will be interested in a scheming person like you.\u201dBy now, Pei Yunge had already lost her patience after being picked on by Cheng Zihuai several times. Every comment he made was filled with thorns, wanting to stab her to death.She suddenly lifted the corners of her lips, her eyes raising slightly. As she looked towards him, she was the picture of charm and defiance at the same.\u201cScheming? Do you think you\u2019re worthy?\u201d1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Slowly, she asked another question in return.\u201cDo I need the Qin family to be arrogant?\u201dThe girl\u2019s features were extremely pretty, but she made others feel that she was extremely provocative. In fact, her words rendered Cheng Zihuai so speechless that his face flushed completely red!It was only after Pei Yunge left on her own accord that Cheng Zihuai finally took in a deep breath to make himself calm down.As he stared at Pei Yunge\u2019s back, dark riidicule and coldness appeared in his eyes.Never mind. He didn\u2019t need to bother about this type of person either.Compared to a goddess like Qin Youjiao that had been groomed to be both beautiful and talented since young, Pei Yunge was indeed the humiliation of the Qin family.1It was no wonder she couldn\u2019t receive the concern and love of the Qin family.2Served her right.1\u2026For the next two days, Pei Yunge was busy finishing her project as she waited for the brain surgeon\u2019s reply.It was only on Friday that Pei Yunge suddenly remembered that she forgot to tell that person about this.After class.Pei Yunge found a deserted corner in school and called Huo Shidu.\u2026In the Huo Corporation.The handsome and dignified man had just finished a meeting. The atmosphere around him was suffocating and frozen.One had no choice but to admit that every of the Huo Corporation\u2019s internal meetings felt like a court trial awaiting its verdict. It felt extremely ominous and stressful.However, after everyone left, the man heard the vibrations of his phone. His cold pale-colored orbs glanced at the caller ID on the screen before he picked up his phone and answered the call.He asked carelessly, \u201cChild, you\u2019re calling Older Brother during class?\u201d(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)\u201cWe just finished,\u201d Pei Yunge said. \u201cOlder Brother, I have to go home today.\u201d\u201cGo home?\u201d\u201cMm, my grandpa has just returned from the hospital, so I\u2019m planning to go and visit him.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dWith Huo Shidu\u2019s reply, before Pei Yunge could hang up the call, she heard him ask again.\u201cOh right, Yunyun, how were the results of your previous monthly exam?\u201dPei Yunge did not know what to say. How did he even know about her exams?The corners of the man\u2019s curled-up eyes drooped slightly as he said lazily, \u201cYunyun, Older Brother thinks that you being like this won\u2019t do\u2026\u201dIn the end, when the call ended, a whole weekend of revision packages had been arranged for Pei Yunge. At the same time, Huo Shidu, who was sitting in front of his office desk, remained in deep thought for a while, before he called Qin Yu as well.\u2026In the Qin family old manor.Old Master Qin had yet to return, but Mrs Qin had already changed into a violet cheongsam. She had dressed herself up to look demure and elegant as she waited.\u201cMom, will Grandpa be like the past when he returns this time\u2026\u201dQin Youjiao hid the anger and resentment in her eyes as her fists were so tightly clasped together that her fingers had turned white.In the past, it could be said that Old Master Qin doted on her and treated her as his biological granddaughter. However, ever since Pei Yunge returned, Old Master Qin had been biased towards Pei Yunge in every way.He even forbade her from staying in the old mansion because of Pei Yunge.At the thought that she could only go stay in a nearby hotel every time she returned to the old mansion in the past two years, the hatred in Qin Youjiao\u2019s heart grew even thicker.How was Pei Yunge comparable to her?She was clearly a useless piece of trash! However, the old man only recognized the dead facts and only saw blood ties to be the most important!\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you know how much Grandpa doted on you before. He just needs some time\u2026\u201d1As Mrs Qin stared at Qin Youjiao, her heart ached for the latter uncontrollably. With a sigh, she comforted her daughter, \u201cHowever, you know Grandpa sees blood ties as important. Nevertheless, as long as Jiaojiao, you are filial, how could Grandpa bear to remain steel-hearted?\u201dHearing this, Qin Youjiao\u2019s tone sounded a little pitiful. \u201cReally?

Your grandpa will definitely like this. When the time comes, you tell Grandpa that you bought this, do you understand?\u201dHearing this, a dark glint flashed in Qin Youjiao\u2019s eyes before she looked up and asked again, \u201cMom, is it very expensive?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about two million dollars.\u201dMrs Qin caressed Qin Youjiao\u2019s head adoringly, the love impossible to hide in her voice. \u201cJiaojiao, don\u2019t worry. With Mom around, I will definitely make Grandpa pay attention to you. Besides, my daughter is so outstanding. How can anyone bear to ignore you?\u201d\u201cThank you, Mom!\u201dQin Youjiao was extremely touched as she hugged Mrs Qin agitatedly. However, she hid the gloating resentment in her eyes.So what if Pei Yunge was the Qin family\u2019s biological daughter? In the end, everything would still be hers.At this thought, Qin Youjiao\u2019s mood improved drastically.On the other hand, because of Qin Youjiao\u2019s piano recital tour, Mrs Qin had been the envy of several wives of rich families. They praised her whenever they met her and it made her look more radiant and happy.She hid the darkness in her eyes.No matter what, she must keep Jiaojiao.If not, when people found out that Pei Yunge was her biological daughter in the future, the latter would only embarrass her.4\u2026Not too long later, Mr Qin and Qin Lang stood at the door and helped support a thin old man on both sides.Seeing this, Mrs Qin immediately pulled on Qin Youjiao\u2019s hand and went to welcome them with a smile. \u201cFather, you\u2019re finally back.\u201dAfter Old Master Qin heard her, he merely glanced at her before his eyes landed on Qin Youjiao again. He froze for a moment before his expression darkened.\u201cWhere\u2019s my Ge\u2019er?!\u201dAt this moment, Mrs Qin had yet to even have Qin Youjiao greet Old Master Qin, yet they were already hearing the Old Master\u2019s questioning. Her expression turned ugly immediately.After calming herself down, Mrs Qin smiled as she said, \u201cShe probably hasn\u2019t arrived yet\u2026\u201dHer tone changed as she said with a hidden agenda, \u201cHowever, Jiaojiao and her are in the same school. Jiaojiao arrived really early, so I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s so busy with.\u201dHearing this, Qin Lang\u2019s expression darkened as well.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)Was she saying that Ge\u2019er was unfilial in front of Grandpa?Just as Qin Lang was about to speak, he heard Old Master Qin say angrily, \u201cYou don\u2019t know what your daughter is busy with and you dare say it?! What if Ge\u2019er got into trouble on her way here, what do we do then?!\u201d3Qin Lang was speechless.This really didn\u2019t need his help at all.Grandpa was still extremely biased, just like in the past.Indeed, faced with Old Master Qin\u2019s tirade and open favoritism, Mrs Qin\u2019s expression darkened like the underside of a burnt pot. Qin Youjiao, who was beside her, was stiff from head to toe. She felt as if she didn\u2019t belong to the Qin family\u20262\u201cThat child doesn\u2019t need my concern. I didn\u2019t take care of her in the past either.\u201dMrs Qin forced a smile onto her face. \u201cFather, Jiaojiao worked really hard recently. Her results are the overall second place and she even got the first prize in a competition. Soon, there will be a pi\u30fc\u201d\u201cAh Lang, go and call Ge\u2019er quick! Ask Ge\u2019er if something has happened to her.\u201dOld Master Qin turned his head and said worriedly to Qin Lang, \u201cIf she did get bullied, she\u2019ll definitely keep quiet about it! This child always treats herself as an orphan!\u201d1Instantly, the atmosphere fell silent.Mr Qin and Mrs Qin\u2019s expressions looked even worse as they couldn\u2019t even say anything.1Apart from Old Master Qin, no one dared to say this sort of truth right out.Qin Lang held in his laughter as he hurriedly nodded and called Pei Yunge right in front of Mr Qin, Mrs Qin and Qin Youjiao.However, a voice came in from the door right at this moment.\u201cI came late, sorry.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Finally, her eyes fell on Old Master Qin.When Pei Yunge looked at the old man in front of her and saw the happiness in his eyes, she hesitated for a moment. \u201cGrandpa?\u201d\u201cGe\u2019er, did something happen along the way? Or is there too much homework in school? Why did you lose so much weight?\u201dThe more Old Master Qin spoke, the more his heart ached. Holding Pei Yunge\u2019s hand, there was guilt and self-reproach in his eyes. If he had a stronger body, he could have kept Ge\u2019er by his side and let her live a good life for another ten or twenty years.But God made a fool of him. His body could not last for another year or two. If he died, he would be most worried about Ge\u2019er.Thinking of this, Old Master Qin\u2019s eyes turned red.\u201cNo.\u201dPei Yunge could see that the old man in front of her was really good to her, but for the time being, it was difficult for her to accept the family of the original protagonist.Before long, a helpless look appeared in Pei Yunge\u2019s eyes and she said with a light laugh, \u201cGrandpa, I fell asleep during self-study class, so I didn\u2019t come here in time.\u201dHearing this, Qin Youjiao looked contemptuous, and the corners of her lips could not help but lift up in a sarcastic smile.Fell asleep during self-study class?How long could such a person stay in Hengde??Not only Qin Youjiao, but also Mr and Mrs Qin frowned unconsciously. They did not expect Pei Yunge to be so ignorant and incompetent.She had fallen asleep in class? Did she not feel ashamed at all?But when Old Master Qin heard this, he took Pei Yunge\u2019s hand with a smile and led her to the hall.\u201cThat\u2019s good! High school students should know how to strike a balance between work and rest!\u201d1Hearing such biased words from Old Master Qin, Mrs Qin felt uncomfortable and frowned. \u201cJiaojiao has to do exercises even after a day full of classes. Sleeping in class? If she can\u2019t pass the university entrance, wouldn\u2019t she be a laughing stock?\u201dAs soon as her voice fell, Mrs Qin felt Old Master\u2019s Qin icy gaze and her mouth immediately snapped shut.Then, Old Master Qin sneered. \u201cWho dares to laugh at my granddaughter? The inheritance left by me, Qin Kaiming, is enough for my granddaughter to spend her whole life!\u201dThese words made Mr and Mrs Qin\u2019s expressions darken, and Qin Youjiao was left seething, as the feelings of jealousy and resentment coursed through her.How was this old man not biased! His heart was clearly running behind Pei Yunge and lifting her to the high heavens!!(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)1Old Master Qin was too lazy to care about the three people beside him and said kindly to Pei Yunge, \u201cMy darling grandchild, our family is not short of money. If you can\u2019t pass the exam, it\u2019s fine. Your three brothers will take care of you in the future. If they don\u2019t, I\u2019ll break their legs.\u201d\u2026If it was before, Qin Lang would definitely snort.But now, Qin Lang\u2019s handsome face was full of care and he looked at Pei Yunge\u2019s side profile. \u201cAs long as Ge\u2019er is willing, I\u2019ll put all of my money into her bank account.\u201dHearing Qin Lang saying this, Qin Youjiao\u2019s face turned green with envy!What had happened suddenly? Qin Lang\u2019s attitude towards Pei Yunge was even more doting than he was to her before. How could she not sense the disparity? Qin Youjiao bit her lip hard and tried not to let herself lose her composure.Suddenly, she took Mrs Qin\u2019s hand with a gloomy expression on her face. \u201cMom, am I not supposed to be here?\u201dWhen she saw her daughter\u2019s downtrodden expression, Mrs Qin felt a stabbing pain in her heart and she immediately took Qin Youjiao\u2019s hand as she said to Old Master Qin, \u201cDad, Jiaojiao has a gift for you.

Let\u2019s get ready to eat first.\u201d1With that, Old Master Qin took Pei Yunge and let her sit beside the head of the table.Usually, only those younger members of the family whom the elder liked had the chance to sit in that seat. Seeing this, Qin Youjiao\u2019s eyes darkened and her fingernails almost broke the skin of her palms!Mrs Qin could not help frowning. \u201cDad, Ah Ting has always been the one sitting here before. How can you let her\u2026 Ge\u2019er sit here?\u201dOld Master Qin was not happy after hearing this.He had no expression on his face. \u201cIn this case, Ge\u2019er will sit at the head of the table. An old man like me can just take a stool and sit next to Ge\u2019er. Is that acceptable then?\u201d1Mr Qin immediately said, \u201cDad, you must be joking. There\u2019s nothing particular about this seat. Whoever you want to sit next to you, will sit next to you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d Old Master Qin snorted, pulled Pei Yunge\u2019s hand and sat down.Qin Youjiao\u2019s eyes turned red with envy when she saw this! Even when she was the most doted on in the Qin family before, she did not have this treatment!!By now, Qin Youjiao was unbearably upset, and Mrs Qin\u2019s expression did not look good as well.\u201cThere\u2019s still a little time before we start eating. Dad, why don\u2019t you have a look at Jiaojiao\u2019s present first?\u201d Mrs Qin urged.Hearing this, Old Master Qin furrowed his eyebrows and glanced at the pair.Taking advantage of the opportunity, Qin Youjiao put the gift box on the table and opened it.Inside was a silver ornament from overseas.It was not too expensive to make Old Master Qin suspicious, nor would its price fall, plus it was rare. Mrs Qin knew that Old Master Qin liked silver from overseas.\u201cYou bought this?\u201dOld Master Qin looked at Qin Youjiao. \u201cThis is not cheap, is it?\u201dQin Youjiao lowered her head and nodded. \u201cBut if Grandpa likes it, it doesn\u2019t matter how expensive it is.\u201dOld Master Qin sighed. He had seen this child grown up and she was indeed filial.But, Mr and Mrs Qin\u2019s preference for Qin Youjiao really angered him. This was one of the main reasons that led to Old Mr Qin being extremely furious.\u201cThank you.\u201d Old Mr Qin was still indifferent.Seeing this, Mrs Qin said with a smile, \u201cJiaojiao has always been sensible.\u201d Then, she asked casually, \u201cGe\u2019er, what did you buy for your grandfather?\u201d(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)Having been put on the spot, Pei Yunge looked up and met with Mrs Qin\u2019s eyes, which made Mrs Qin feel an inexplicable guilt.Then Pei Yunge only said calmly, \u201cI didn\u2019t buy anything.\u201dWhen she heard this, Qin Youjiao, who was sitting by the side, had a look of ridicule in her eyes. Beside her, Mrs Qin said, \u201cYour grandfather just came back and you didn\u2019t buy anything for him?\u201d\u201cEnough!\u201dOld Master Qin frowned. \u201cGe\u2019er being healthy is the best gift to me!\u201dBefore Mirs Qin had the time to refute, she heard Qin Lang ask, \u201cMom, how much living expenses have you given to Ge\u2019er?\u201dLiving expenses?\u00a0Mrs Qin choked and her expression changed.\u201cWhat? Why are you hesitating? Does Ge\u2019er not receive any living expenses?\u201dOld Master Qin\u2019s expression darkened in an instant.\u201cN-No, that\u2019s not it. I\u2019ve always asked the butler to give her the living expenses.\u201dAt this, Qin Lang gave a wry chuckle. \u201cI fired the butler. He only gave Ge\u2019er $2000 for living expenses every month. The rest he took it for himself.\u201d1\u201cTwo thousand???\u201dOld Master Qin slammed his fist on the table and was almost dizzy from the pulsating rage he felt inside. \u201cAre you even her biological parents?!\u201d2Mr and Mrs Qin swallowed down their response and only looked flustered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why didn\u2019t Pei Yunge say this earlier?\u201cYou didn\u2019t know? Why don\u2019t you say a few more words of concern to Ge\u2019er? How dare a servant bully Ge\u2019er like this!?\u201dOld Master Qin\u2019s vision became fuzzy. Pei Yunge saw that Old Master Qin was overly emotional, so she immediately helped him up.\u201cGrandpa, have a seat first.\u201dPei Yunge helped Old Master Qin to his seat and took out a paper bag. There was a red scarf made of thick yarn.\u201cIt\u2019ll probably take another three months before you can use this gift, Grandpa.\u201dPei Yunge laughed and her pretty eyes curved.The original Pei Yunge had prepared this for Old Master Qin. However, she had only knitted half of it. Last night, when she was completing the remaining project, she suddenly remembered about it.Hence, Pei Yunge learned how to knit from watching videos. She had unraveled and knitted the scarf the whole night.\u201cY-You knitted this, Ge\u2019er?\u201dOld Master Qin could not help asking excitedly.\u201cMm, I wonder if Grandpa likes it.\u201d\u201cI do, Grandpa likes it so much! Ge\u2019er made this herself. It\u2019s better than anything else!\u201dOld Master Qin took out the scarf and looked at it. He smiled till his eyes narrowed. Then, he carefully put it back into the bag.Seeing this.Pei Yunge\u2019s lips curled up.The contract of the computing institute had just been signed and three months worth of salary had yet to be given out. As for Yu Manran, she had already paid a down payment.But this was not enough for her to buy a present for the Old Master.So Pei Yunge planned to make up for it during Old Master Qin\u2019s birthday.However\u2026Seeing this, Qin Youjiao\u2019s expression was terrible and she was trembling from anger.She had given the Old Master a gift that was worth two million yuan, but it was not even comparable to Pei Yunge\u2019s scarf which cost less than two hundred yuan!?(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)Soon.Mr Qin apologized, \u201cDad, it was our mistake. We didn\u2019t know this would happen.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a mistake. You are just heartless! Even a monster would not hurt its own children.\u201dEach of Old Master Qin\u2019s words were like daggers which stabbed the hearts of Mr and Mrs Qin.They were embarrassed.Qin Youjiao gritted her teeth in hatred as she glared at Pei Yunge darkly.Why did Pei Yunge have to exist?If it wasn\u2019t for Pei Yunge, she would be the one and only Young Miss of the Qin family and the Old Master wouldn\u2019t treat her like this either.At this moment.Pei Yunge looked up and glanced at her playfully before she slowly poured herself a cup of tea.No one realized that the girl, who did not even dare to lift her head back then, now had a languid expression. Every frown and action of hers was elegant.Qin Youjiao clenched her fists and pretended to smile.\u201cYunge, you must be feeling aggrieved. However, if I\u2019m being doted on by Grandpa like this, it\u2019s worth it no matter how much I suffer.\u201dWith that said, everyone thought that Pei Yunge would say a few words to express her stand.However, Pei Yunge only waited for the dishes to be served before she slowly peeled the prawns.Then, he placed it on the Old Master\u2019s plate.\u201cGrandpa, eat more.\u201d\u201cOur Ge\u2019er is still the sensible one. It\u2019s obvious that Ge\u2019er is the one who dotes on Grandpa!\u201dThe old man, who used to be ruthless in the business world, was now smiling so brightly that benevolent eyes. He felt like he was floating after being coaxed.This scene made the expressions of the three Qin brothers darken.In the past, Pei Yunge was already excessively doted on. Now, she even had the ability to make the Old Master happy.Suddenly.Suddenly, a delightful voice could be heard from the door.\u201cI heard that Old Master Qin is here today and my father especially asked me to pay him a visit.\u201d\u201cI wonder if I\u2019ve disturbed everyone. \u201dHearing this, everyone turned to look at the young man walking towards them.However, their gaze could not help but shift to the person beside him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62: Yunyun, Is That Your Nickname?Old Master Qin and Mr Qin recognized the person who had just spoken.It was the heir of the Yu family, Yu Hanran. The Yu family often had business partnerships with the Qin family.It was a well-known fact that he had a handsome and charming appearance.However, the other person beside Yu Hanran was even more eye-catching.At this moment.When Pei Yunge looked up, her eyes met with those pale-colored pupils. She froze.This was her first time seeing Huo Shidu dressed so formally.Dressed in an expensive black tailored suit, he looked even more handsome and dignified.His deep and cold eyes exuded a sense of careless distance.But at this moment\u2026Seeing the little girl\u2019s dazed expression, the man\u2019s lips unconsciously curved into a frivolous and lazy smile.At the same time.Yu Hanran introduced, \u201cOh, right.

However, it was not like Master Du gave them a chance to worm their way into being friends.\u201cAlright, alright. Please have a seat. It\u2019s a family banquet today, so I didn\u2019t prepare for any special guests. It\u2019s a pity,\u201d Old Master Qin said with a smile.However, Old Master Qin also found it strange.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)In the past, the Yu family and their family were not on close terms. Why would they suddenly pay a visit?And he even saw the new President of the Huo Corporation?!\u201cIt\u2019s good that Old Master Qin doesn\u2019t mind me freeloading off of him.\u201dYu Hanran proved to be a talkative person as he started to liven up the atmosphere.As for Pei Yunge, she stared at Huo Shidu openly. She did not expect Huo Shidu to appear here.What was unexpected was also the fact that Qin Lang had also met Huo Shidu before, other than Pei Yunge.Wasn\u2019t this the man who abducted his Ge\u2019er previously?!However\u2026Qin Lang didn\u2019t show it as he was afraid it would create trouble for Pei Yunge.Suddenly.With a smile, Mrs Qin asked, \u201cMay I know if Mr Huo is married?\u201dHearing this, Yu Hanran, who was beside him, seemed to have choked and started coughing.Wasn\u2019t Mrs Qin a little too daring?!Did Huo Shidu need her to worry about his marriage?Which of the top noble families in the country didn\u2019t want to have a marriage alliance with the Huo family? Besides, this person was Huo Shidu.\u201cNo,\u201d Huo Shidu said.Qin Youjiao\u2019s face was flushed red. She didn\u2019t dare to look at this man whom she had not been able to take her eyes off of the moment he entered.It was true that for girls of this age, such a handsome and mature man was simply a walking hormone.Simply irresistible.\u201cOh, I see. Mr Huo doesn\u2019t seem too old. Our Jiaojiao\u2026\u201dBefore Mrs Qin could finish speaking, she felt Old Master Qin\u2019s warning gaze. Thereafter, her voice trailed off.She felt uncomfortable too.How could she let Jiaojiao miss out on a man with such excellent qualifications?The Old Master forbade her from introducing him to Jiaojiao. Could he possibly be interested in Pei Yunge?!Huo Shidu asked, \u201cJiaojiao?\u201dHearing the man call her name, Qin Youjiao\u2019s heart rate increased even more.However, in the next second, Huo Shidu could not help but chuckle softly. Huo Shidu\u2019s magnetic voice was both charming and light.\u201cYunyun, is that your nickname?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Their gaze changed from shock to disbelief.What was going on?These two knew each other?!Suddenly, Qin Youjiao looked conflicted and extremely embarrassed. Instinctively, she turned to look at Pei Yunge.How did Pei Yunge know such a man?When Old Master Qin had mentioned the surname Huo, she suddenly remembered that her friend had mentioned the Huo family.Especially the current President of the Huo Corporation, Huo Shidu.Even though she was the Qin family\u2019s Young Miss now, she knew that there was a huge difference between her and this man.But at this moment\u2026However, she saw with her own eyes how this handsome and dignified man called Pei Yunge \u2018Yunyun\u2019 intimately.\u201cGe\u2019er, you\u2026 know each other?\u201dOld Master Qin was the first to react as he asked in disbelief.\u201c\u2026\u201dPei Yunge glanced at Huo Shidu and smiled after a while. \u201cWe met by chance.\u201dUpon hearing this, Yu Hanran, who was beside him, turned to look at Pei Yunge.The rest of the people were doubtful and thought that these two might not be anything, but he knew Master Du\u2019s temper very well!If there was nothing between them, would Master Du, who was never interested in women, take the initiative to approach her?But then again, this girl was indeed eye-catching and beautiful\u2026Suddenly.Old Master Qin said with a smile, \u201cThen our Ge\u2019er must have troubled you, Mr Huo.\u201d(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)\u201cIt\u2019s not much trouble.\u201dHuo Shidu lifted his lips and saw that Pei Yunge was still staring at him.Suddenly.He chuckled subtly.

It was not considered sweet, but there was an inexplicable charm to it.However, when she called him \u2018Brother Shidu\u2019, it made the man\u2019s arrogant gaze darken as all light disappeared from them.His throat tickled.After a moment, the man was calm and composed again.However, Qin Youjiao could not help but speak up.\u201cMr Huo, my name is Qin Youjiao.\u201dHer face flushed red. \u201cYou can call me Jiaojiao.\u201dHuo Shidu did not even bat an eyelid as he hummed half-heartedly, indicating that he heard her.This stark difference in treatment made Qin Youjiao\u2019s face flush red and turn pale. She bit her lip hard!Why was this man so intimate with Pei Yunge but the complete opposite with her?!Seeing Qin Youjiao\u2019s eyes turn red, Mrs Qin immediately said with a smile, \u201cA person like Mr Huo must have been very outstanding since he was a child.\u201d\u201cOur Jiaojiao is the same. She won\u2019t lose to anyone in any aspect. \u201dWith that said, Mrs Qin shot a warning glance at Pei Yunge.However, she did not notice that the man\u2019s gaze were turning cold.Mrs Qin\u2019s words even made Yu Hanran frown.What was going on? This Mrs Qin?!It felt like Jiaojiao was her biological daughter.The other one was like Cinderella with a stepmother.\u201cEnough! Is that how the Madam of the house behaves?\u201dSeeing how Mrs Qin couldn\u2019t wait to let Qin Youjiao familiarize herself with Huo Shidu, Old Master Qin\u2019s expression darkened!\u201cI\u2019m just afraid that Mr Huo will be too bored here, so I asked Jiaojiao to chat with Mr Huo,\u201d Mrs Qin said awkwardly.\u201cDo you think Mr Huo needs you to worry about him?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I finally got in touch with him.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t I accompany you to Ming City soon and see if there are any better treatment methods?\u201d\u201cGrand Secretary Fang? Isn\u2019t it very difficult to meet Doctor Fang?\u201dOld Master Qin had heard that this neurologist was very famous in the industry. However, this person was arrogant and was difficult to meet.The moment Mr Qin heard his words, his eyes filled with pride. He then said with a smile, \u201cDoctor Fang gave a speech in Hengde previously and has a deep impression of Jiaojiao. \u201d\u201cThis time, he\u2019s actually doing this on account of Jiaojiao. \u201dOld Master Qin didn\u2019t expect this either.Qin Youjiao looked down shyly and said softly, \u201cI didn\u2019t help much. It\u2019s just that Doctor Fang happened to be free, so he saved me some face.\u201d\u201cJiaojiao, why are you being so modest with your family? Why is Doctor Fang only giving Jiaojiao face and not others?\u201dWith a doting smile, Mrs Qin said to Old Master Qin, \u201cDad, Jiaojiao is really concerned about you.\u201d\u201cBesides the two million yuan gift she gave you this time, she is also very concerned about your condition. She hopes you can recover as soon as possible. \u201dAfter saying this, Mrs Qin could not help but glance at Pei Yunge.All she saw was Pei Yunge sitting by the sofa while using her phone. She had no intention of looking up and speaking at all.Her lips twitched as disgust flashed in her eyes before she turned around.However, she never thought that this scene would be seen by the man beside her.\u2026Over here.With a hand supporting her head, Pei Yunge saw a message request.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)[Hello, Miss Pei. I\u2019m Steven from R Nation\u2019s medical institute.]Before Pei Yunge could click on the option to add, she saw two more messages.[I\u2019m sorry. I blocked Marcus two days ago and only saw your project today\u2026][Steven: I like your project very much. I wonder if you would be willing to work with me?]Pei Yunge\u2019s eyelid twitched. It was obvious that this Mr Steven was rather anxious.She agreed very quickly.[Y.G.: This project is complete. If Mr Steven likes it, I can provide a follow-up.][However, I have an important relative in need of a brain surgery. May I know if Mr Steven can help?]At this moment.In a research institute overseas.Steven\u2019s eyes lit up. Excited, he replied to Pei Yunge quickly.[Of course! I\u2019m fine with it anytime!! However, can Miss Pei give me a medical record first?]This was a chance to get closer to the big boss!He might just be able to poach her from the computing institute sneakily and invite her to their medical institute!!!However\u2026After reading Steven\u2019s message, Pei Yunge thought for a moment before turning to ask Old Master Qin.\u201cGrandpa, can you give me a copy of your medical record?\u201dOld Master Qin asked instinctively, \u201cGe\u2019er, what do you want the medical record for?\u201d\u201cYunge, stop messing around. Jiaojiao invited Doctor Fang to be the attending doctor because of Grandpa.\u201d Mr Qin frowned.It was as if Pei Yunge was being unreasonable and was deliberately competing with Qin Youjiao.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65: I Will Drag You BackPei Yunge looked at him. \u201cCan Doctor Fang treat Grandpa completely?\u201dMr Qin choked.Although Fang Gesheng was a famous doctor in the field of neurology, he could not guarantee a 100% cure.Back then, after Doctor Fang finished reading Old Master Qin\u2019s medical records, he only said that he would try his best to let Old Master Qin live for a few more years.\u201cIf you Doctor Fang can\u2019t cure Grandpa completely, why don\u2019t you give other doctors a try?\u201dPei Yunge looked at him calmly.\u201cPei Yunge, don\u2019t treat your grandfather\u2019s life like it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of doctor do you know? Do you think you can compare Doctor Fang to a quack who doesn\u2019t even have a doctor\u2019s license?\u201d\u201cEnough!\u201dOld Master Qin\u2019s face was livid as he glared at them coldly.When Mrs Qin\u2019s lips twitched as if she was about to say something to no avail, Old Master Qin got the butler to bring the medical record over.Old Master Qin took the medical record and walked towards Pei Yunge, passing it to her before caressing her head.The Old Masters face was full of love and affection. \u201cGrandpa knows that Ge\u2019er is a filial child.\u201dPei Yunge was stunned for a moment before she took the medical record. The corners of her lips curled up. \u201cGrandpa, don\u2019t worry.\u201dA dark glimmer flashed past her beautiful eyes, but she sounded like she was joking.\u201cAs long as there is a 1% chance of success, I will drag you back even if it means going through the gates of hell.\u201dNot many people took her words seriously.However, Old Master Qin\u2019s eyes were red as he reached out to hug Pei Yunge once more.At this age, he wasn\u2019t afraid of death.The only thing he was afraid of was that Ge\u2019er would lead a difficult life.The Old Master laughed, hiding the tremble in his voice. \u201cOkay, Grandpa also can\u2019t bear to leave before seeing Ge\u2019er get married.\u201dUpon hearing this, Yu Hanran subconsciously glanced at Huo Shidu, who was beside him.He saw Huo Shidu standing at the side. He tugged at his tie a little impatiently with his well-defined fingers as his throat moved.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)His usual lazy pale-colored pupils were filled with coldness and unreadable emotions as his aura became increasingly oppressive.Huo Shidu had guessed that Pei Yunge was not favored at home. Otherwise, she would rather hang onto a strange man\u2019s neck and ask him to take her away than to go back with her biological brother.However, to his surprise, the Qin family\u2019s situation was worse than he had imagined.If it wasn\u2019t for Old Master Qin, he probably would have taken the little girl away without his protection.\u2026Steven was still waiting. Pei Yunge had roughly read through the medical records and translated it simply for Steven before sending the CT taken in the hospital to him as wellIt was daytime in R Nation now, so the results would probably be released very soon.Pei Yunge knew that Old Master Qin\u2019s condition had worsened. If she delayed any longer, it would only become more dangerous.However\u2026Not long after Pei Yunge sent the materials to Steven, Steven gave a reply.[Steven: This surgery is doable, but he must undergo it as soon as possible. Also, Miss Pei, you need to send me the complete medical record tomorrow.]Pei Yunge heaved a sigh of relief subconsciously, before she smiled and continued chatting with him.[Y.G.: Okay, sorry to trouble you, Mr Steven.][Y.G.: When is Mr Steven free? Where will the surgery take place?][Steven: Since Old Master is unwell, I\u2019ll go to Yun Cheng. How about next Wednesday? I\u2019ll also talk to Miss Pei about the project then.]Seeing this message, Pei Yunge was a little surprised. She knew that Steven placed her grandfather\u2019s matters first.[Y.G.: Okay, thank you very much.]\u88f4\u5141\u6b4c\u521a\u4ece\u82b1\u56ed\u7684\u79cb\u5343\u4e0a\u7ad9\u8d77\u6765,\u5c31\u770b\u5230\u4e0d\u8fdc\u5904\u7684\u7537\u4eba.As their conversation ended, Pei Yunge stood up from the swing in the garden. Just then, she saw the man not far away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66: There\u2019s Nothing Much to See, Yunyun.\u201dPei Yunge regained her senses. \u201cOlder Brother, why are you here?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s noisy inside.\u201dThe man was tall and had long legs. His black suit was exquisitely tailored, making him look indolent and noble. With just a casual glance from his pale-colored pupils, one\u2019s legs would turn weak.This was the mature temperament which could not be found in the boys in school.\u201cChild, are you adopted?\u201dThe man leaned in and sized her up casually, his magnetic voice sounding extremely sexy.\u201c\u2026No.\u201dPei Yunge could smell the almost indiscernible scent of alcohol on the man. She hesitated for a moment. \u201cBrother, did you\u2026 Did you drink?\u201dHowever, before she could finish speaking\u2026She was interrupted by a voice not too far away.\u201cJiaojiao, don\u2019t go! What will happen to Mom if you leave?\u201dQin Youjiao ran out of the living room while crying. She fell on the floor accidentally. Mrs Qin chased after her anxiously.Hurriedly, she helped her up, her eyes filled with heartache.\u201cJiaojiao, does it hurt?!\u201d\u201cMom, I\u2019m not from the Qin family. I\u2019m an outsider!\u201dQin Youjiao sobbed uncontrollably.Mrs Qin hugged Qin Youjiao. \u201cNo, Jiaojiao will always be my only daughter.\u201d\u201cJiaojiao, Dad has raised you for 19 years, how could he treat you as an outsider?\u201dAlthough Mr Qin had always been composed, he had revealed his concern towards Qin Youjiao.Not far away.This scene of family harmony was witnessed by Pei Yunge.Pei Yunge\u2019s lips were still curled up, however the smile was not sincere.But she did not notice that the man\u2019s eyes were dark and rich, making it hard to what he was feeling. His eyes were calm, but they were inexplicably aggressive.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)In the next moment, he stretched out his slender hand and pulled up Pei Yunge\u2019s loose hoodie a little frivolously.Before Pei Yunge could react, the cap covered half of her face.Instantly, her line of sight was covered.All she heard was the man\u2019s careless voice. It was rather magnetic and attractive.\u201cWhat are you looking at? What is more good looking than your brother?\u201dPei Yunge was a little afraid of the dark. Hence, she subconsciously looked up, only revealing her exquisite chin.The man\u2019s eyes happened to land on her red lips.While Huo Shidu wasn\u2019t paying attention, Pei Yunge had subconsciously grabbed the hem of Huo Shidu\u2019s suit. They were extremely close to each other.She was about to take off her hat when he grabbed her hand.With a slight push, Pei Yunge moved forward and slammed into the man\u2019s muscular chest.\u201cYou-\u201dPei Yunge looked up, but did not see Huo Shidu\u2019s lips curl up as his eyes remained fixed on her.She heard the man\u2019s low and pleasant voice.His laughter was very charming.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing much to see, Yunyun.\u201dHis slender and fair hand pinched the nape of her neck casually and intimately.Suddenly, Pei Yunge\u2019s spine tingled and she lost strength in her body.She almost lost his balance.What was wrong with this man today?Endless seduction!?Not far away.Qin Youjiao had just been comforted by Mr and Mrs Qin. With a gloating look in her eyes, she tried to find Pei Yunge.However, she saw that there was a hood covering Pei Yunge\u2019s head. She had just regained her balance and her hand was still on the man\u2019s waist.The dignified and handsome man\u2019s eyes were fixed on Pei Yunge.It was as if he was teasing her on purpose.The atmosphere was not heavy at all.Not to mention, she did not see the terrible state Pei Yunge was in.Suddenly, Qin Youjiao\u2019s expression darkened even more as the jealousy in her heart surged.In the past, Pei Yunge cared the most about how the Qin couple treated her.But now\u2026She could actually flirt with another man and didn\u2019t care about it at all?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67: Why Are You Daydreaming While Looking at Your Older Brother?Over here.Before Pei Yunge could take off her cap, she heard the man\u2019s lazy voice.\u201cYunyun, stop touching Older Brother\u2019s waist stealthily.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPei Yunge had just taken off her hat and was about to speak, when her eyes met with the man\u2019s slender eyes. It was the first time they were so physically close to each other.She knew that the man\u2019s eyes were good-looking and the corners of his eyes were curled up seductively. His eyes were supposed to be filled with affection, but his pale-colored pupils only looked indifferent and cold.They looked like cold and dark moons.Instantly, Pei Yunge\u2019s anger dissipated.This type of aloof and refined scum was completely her type.However\u2026Huo Shidu stared at the little girl in front of him. From the faint smile that was filled with anger, she gradually calmed down and stared at him openly.It was straightforward and daring.\u201cWhy are you daydreaming while looking at your Older Brother?\u201dHuo Shidu laughed lazily. His slender and jade-like hand scratched her chin, as if he was teasing a cat.Pei Yunge was about to speak when Old Master Qin\u2019s voice rang from behind.\u201cY-You all want to anger me to death!\u201dInstinctively, Pei Yunge turned her head. She saw Qin Lang helping Old Master Qin out.The Old Master\u2019s expression did not look too good.Seeing this, Pei Yunge was about to walk over when she was pulled back by Huo Shidu.\u201cYunyun, Older Brother has something to tell your grandfather. Will you wait for me in the car first?\u201dPei Yunge was stunned for a moment. Assessing the situation, she suddenly realized that Huo Shidu probably did not want her to look at Qin Youjiao and the rest on purpose just now.She gathered her thoughts and took the key Huo Shidu handed her.\u2026(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)Soon.In the living room, Old Master Qin reprimanded the Qin couple with a cold expression on his face.\u201cDon\u2019t you think this is outrageous?! Is Ge\u2019er is not your biological daughter? How can you not even announce it?\u201d\u201cHow dare you hide this from me? Are you thinking that I won\u2019t live for another year or two anyway?!\u201dHearing this, Mr Qin looked flustered.\u201cDad, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s not the case, what is it?! How can you treat my biological granddaughter like this?!\u201dAt the thought of how this couple had run out and comforted Qin Youjiao anxiously, Old Master Qin wanted to chase these two out.\u201cBoth of you value someone who isn\u2019t your biological daughter more than anything else!\u201d Old Master Qin\u2019s expression was livid.Mrs Qin pursed her lips and said unhappily, \u201cDad, you can\u2019t be so biased. Pei Yunge is your granddaughter but you also watched how Jiaojiao grow up.\u201d\u201cEven so, she can\u2019t compare to my biological granddaughter!\u201dAt this point, Old Master Qin seemed to have overexerted himself due to his anger as he held onto his throbbing heart.This scene made Qin Lang nervous again.\u201cGrandpa, are you alright?\u201dJust now when they were inside, Old Master Qin had almost fainted from anger, giving Qin Lang a fright.\u201cDad.\u201dMr and Mrs Qin became nervous as well as guilt arose in their hearts.After that\u2026However, a voice could be heard from the door right at this moment.\u201cOld Master Qin, please sit down first.\u201dHearing this, everyone turned around and realized that it was Huo Shidu.Yu Hanran, who was watching the show from the side, immediately stood up, wanting to speak to Huo Shidu.However, he heard Huo Shidu say, \u201cYou can go back first. I have something on.\u201dYu Hanran was perplexed.Did Master Du treat him as a tool?He made him bring him to the Qin family and now he was chasing him away?!\u201cMaster Du, aren\u2019t we leaving together?\u201d Yu Hanran asked shamelessly with a smile.Hearing this, Huo Shidu glanced at him indifferently.\u201cI\u2019ll go, I\u2019ll go.\u201d Yu Hanran felt afraid and immediately changed his words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68: My Gift to YunyunAfter Yu Hanran left, Mr Qin said hesitantly, \u201cMr Huo, you\u2026\u201d\u201cI came over in a hurry today and didn\u2019t have the time to choose any gift.\u201d Huo Shidu\u2019s tone was neither too fast nor too slow.The people in the living room were dazed.Then, they saw Huo Shidu walk in front of Old Master Qin. He placed a brand new cooperation agreement on the table with his well-proportioned hands .\u201cThis is my gift to Yunyun.\u201dHaving said that, Mr and Mrs Qin\u2019s expressions changed!Qin Youjiao, who had not dared to make a sound, had resentment in her eyes. She turned even paler as she bit her lip tightly!She stared at the elegant and languid man in front of her in disbelief.\u201cMr Huo, you\u2019re\u2026\u201dOld Master Qin was also stunned. He did not look at the contents of the agreement.\u201cI heard from Mrs Qin that Yunyun only gave Old Mr Qin a scarf which she knitted herself.\u201dThe man\u2019s thin red lips were curved as he said in a casual tone. However, his words were also straightforward and ostentatious, not hiding his indulgence.\u201cIt\u2019s a little childish, but the way young girls express their fondness has always been straightforward.\u201d\u201cBut since Mrs Qin doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate, I\u2019ll make it up to you on behalf of Yunyun.\u201dHearing this, Old Master Qin subconsciously looked at the agreement and froze for a moment.It was the three-year collaboration plan between the Huo Corporation and the Qin Corporation.With the Qin\u2019s Group\u2019s qualifications, it was impossible for them to cooperate with a top corporation like the Huo Corporation.If they work with such a corporation, besides allowing the Qin family to expand their network, the profits brought by this collaboration alone could match the total output value of the Qin family for several years\u2026Not to mention, the contract would ensure that the Qin family had a greater share of profits.\u201cMr Huo, your gift is too much. I can\u2019t accept it.\u201dOld Master Qin rejected it immediately.If he really signed this contract, wouldn\u2019t he be selling his granddaughter?!The moment Mrs Qin and the rest heard this, they could roughly guess the value of the contract.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)\u201cMr Huo, why do you want to give\u2026 Yunge a gift?\u201d Mrs Qin\u2019s expression softened.Mrs Qin also did not think that this man in front of her could be someone who asked for trouble.But with his status, it was impossible that he liked Pei Yunge.\u201cYou can\u2019t blame Yunyun for this.\u201dWith a hand in his pocket, the man said lazily and playfully, \u201cI was too busy these few days and forgot to prepare a gift for Yunyun. I asked her to bring it over.\u201dThe moment he finished speaking, everyone who was present froze and looked towards Huo Shidu instinctively.Did this Mr Huo mean that Pei Yunge\u2026 was staying with him now?!On the other hand, Qin Lang froze completely!What was Qin Yu doing?Wasn\u2019t this man the man who took Ge\u2019er away in front of him that time?How could he let Ge\u2019er stay with him\u2026Suddenly.\u201cWhy?\u201dOld Master Qin was stunned. \u201cGe\u2019er\u2026 is staying with you?\u201dAt the same time, Mr and Mrs Qin\u2019s expressions changed.Now that he knew about this, Old Master Qin would put it on them again.However, Qin Youjiao\u2019s thoughts were still on what Huo Shidu had said just now.Pei Yunge actually stayed in Huo Shidu\u2019s house after she left?!How could this be!?Qin Youjiao\u2019s expression was livid and slightly contorted.She actually thought that Pei Yunge lived outside alone and was lonely and pitiful\u2026\u201cMm.\u201dHuo Shidu admitted frankly, his eyes lazy and thin. \u201cOld Mr Qin, I\u2019m very sorry. I didn\u2019t want Old Mr Qin to be unhappy with Yunyun because of this, so I didn\u2019t mention it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69: Ask For a PromiseAfter that\u2026He glanced at Mr and Mrs Qin and laughed ambiguously. His lips curled up. \u201cBut if Yunyun was happy staying here, she wouldn\u2019t have run out alone at night.\u201dHearing this, Old Master Qin\u2019s heart ached for Pei Yunge.His expression was dark as he glanced at Mr and Mrs Qin. In the end, he took a deep breath and suppressed his anger before he turned to look at Huo Shidu.\u201cThank you, Mr Huo, for taking care of Ge\u2019er during this period of time. However, will it be too much trouble for you in the future\u2026\u201dOld Master Qin was still worried. After all, Pei Yunge was a girl and it wasn\u2019t too appropriate for her to stay in the home of a strange man.\u201cYunyun is no trouble.\u201dHuo Shidu\u2019s words made Old Master Qin freeze for a moment.After a while.He could not help but size up the man in front of him.He was very good-looking, the heir of the Huo family, and an outstanding talent that was unattainable in everyone\u2019s eyes.It could be said that there was nothing to nitpick.It was no wonder that Mrs Qin would think of a way to get Qin Youjiao and Huo Shidu to interact with each other.After that\u2026Mrs Qin spoke up as expected.\u201cYunge is a girl after all. It\u2019s not too convenient for her to stay at Mr Huo\u2019s place. Why don\u2019t you let Yunge cone back\u2026\u201d\u201cI think staying at Mr Huo\u2019s place is pretty good.\u201dOld Master Qin interrupted indifferently.He still had to think for Ge\u2019er.If he was no longer around after a year, there would be someone to protect Ge\u2019er.\u201cDad, but\u2026 It\u2019s not like we can\u2019t afford to raise her. How can we let her stay with another family?\u201d Mrs Qin\u2019s expression did not look too good.\u201cWe can afford to take care of her, but her biological parents are not even comparable to step-fathers and stepmothers.\u201dOld Master Qin laughed. He did not care how terrible Mr and Mrs Qin\u2019s expressions were. He said to Huo Shidu with a smile, \u201cMr Huo, in that case, Ge\u2019er will have to trouble you in the future.\u201d(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)\u201cHowever, you\u2019d better take this agreement back. It\u2019s too expensive.\u201d\u201cIf Old Master Qin really minds, you can treat it as a gift from Yunyun.\u201dHuo Shidu\u2019s thin lips suddenly curved. \u201cHowever, I also want to ask Old Master Qin for a promise on behalf of Yunyun.\u201d\u201cWhat promise?\u201dOld Master Qin asked.In the next moment, Huo Shidu said with a soft and magnetic voice slowly. \u201cOur Yunyun would be one of the four heirs of the Qin family.\u201dOne of the four heirs.Apart from her three older brothers, Pei Yunge had to be the last person to take the place of an heir.Then\u2026Mr and Mrs Qin\u2019s faces turned pale!As for Qin Youjiao, her nails dug into her flesh as her eyes widened in disbelief and her entire body shivered.Everyone could see who Huo Shidu was doing this for.\u201cDad, Jiaojiao has been in our family for so many years, how can she\u2026\u201dMrs Qin panicked and hurriedly grabbed Mr Qin\u2019s hand, signaling him to persuade him.Mr Qin regained his senses and spoke.\u201cMr Huo, although Jiaojiao isn\u2019t our biological daughter, she\u2019s still a young girl whom the Qin family has acknowledged.\u201cWe have made a fool of ourselves. I hope you won\u2019t take what happened today to heart, Mr Huo.\u201d\u201cYeah, actually\u2026 Jiaojiao\u2019s character is very good too. If Yunge said something to you, Mr Huo, it wouldn\u2019t be true.\u201dMrs Qin hurriedly explained on behalf of Qin Youjiao.\u201cMr Huo, do you also think that I stole everything from Pei Yunge?\u201d Qin Youjiao asked.Biting her lip, she put on a stubborn expression as if she had been wronged.Huo Shidu glanced at her calmly, looking languid and casual.Seeing this, Qin Youjiao inexplicably shut up and did not dare to say another word.Then\u2026\u201cDid she agree to let you have it?\u201dHis tone was light.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It looked both pleasant and sexy.\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to take care of a little girl. Older Brother got some management fees from Old Master.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPei Yunge\u2019s eyelids twitched. \u201cWhat did the Old Master say?\u201dHis tone was casual. \u201cI told you to listen to Older Brother and study hard.

His lazy appearance made him look extremely attractive.He looked inexplicably frivolous and languid, making her blush and her heart thump faster.He looked exactly like a refined scum.\u2026The next morning.Before Pei Yunge woke up, she heard movement at the door.It sounded like a woman\u2019s voice.Thereafter, she furrowed her eyebrows tightly. Before she could react, the door suddenly opened.\u201cMaster Du, I\u2019ve brought you breakfast. When should we arrange Miss\u2019s tuition until?\u201dThe woman\u2019s voice entered the bedroom, bringing with it a strong scent of perfume.It completely covered up the bedroom\u2019s original scent.Suddenly, all the sleepiness in Pei Yunge was gone. She rubbed her eyes with the base of her palm, the coldness and annoyance in them disappearing in an instant.At that moment, the woman walked in and placed the tray on the table virtuously. She turned to look at the bedside with a bright smile.However, at this moment, she did not see the man she had expected to see.She only noticed that the person on the bed had fair and slender arms and\u2026 her long black and curly hair.Instantly, the woman\u2019s expression changed as she watched this scene with an ugly expression!How could it be a woman!?This room and its arrangement clearly indicated that it was a man\u2019s room!Before the woman\u2019s expression could soften, the person on the bed slowly sat up, revealing her bright and charming face.Pei Yunge put on her slippers lazily and stood up.Her legs were slender and fair under her nightdress.\u201cYou want to tutor me?\u201dPei Yunge laughed and asked again.Instantly, the woman\u2019s face turned red and green.She forced a smile. \u201cYes, Miss.\u201dIt was not easy for her to fight for the chance to come to Master Du\u2019s house to be a tutor. At first, she thought that it was because Master Du\u2019s sister needed tutoring.But if she was a sister, why would she sleep in Master Du\u2019s bed?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71: Have Lunch After You Finish Copying, How About That?\u201cWait for me downstairs.\u201dPei Yunge had just woken up and her voice was languid.On the other hand, the woman glared at Pei Yunge begrudgingly as she clenched her fists tightly.She had graduated from a famous university and her appearance and family background were not bad. Yet, she had to tutor a high school student who was being provided for?!The woman did not think that this overly good-looking girl in front of her had any amazing background.\u201cDon\u2019t you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201dPei Yunge glanced at her with a faint smile.Instantly, the woman shivered and left the bedroom immediately.Ten minutes later.After Pei Yunge was done washing up, she changed her clothes and went downstairs.When she looked up, she saw the woman sitting by the sofa. She was wearing a tight V-neck chiffon dress that accentuated her curves.However, she didn\u2019t seem like she was here for tutoring.Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t have brought breakfast upstairs and opened Huo Shidu\u2019s door directly.The woman also heard the commotion on the stairs and immediately said with a smile, \u201cMiss, I\u2019m really sorry. I didn\u2019t know you were sleeping there\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I didn\u2019t expect the teacher to be so enthusiastic either.\u201d Pei Yunge smiled slowly.These words made the woman\u2019s face flush red and green.\u201cWhen do we start?\u201d Pei Yunge asked.Although Pei Yunge looked free and reckless, she actually didn\u2019t like to trouble people.Since this was the tutor Huo Shidu had hired, she would not let him worry about this either.She herself did not need any tutoring.\u201cWe can start after breakfast.\u201dThe woman said with a fake smile, but she could not help but feel jealous.How could such a little girl that didn\u2019t know how to flirt attract Master Du\u2019s interest?(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)However\u2026If she could stay here now, she would definitely have a chance to see Master Du.When that time came, Master Du would know the charms of a mature woman and wouldn\u2019t like such an ignorant little girl anymore.At this thought, the woman\u2019s expression eased as she waited patiently by the side.\u2026At the dining table.As Pei Yunge ate her breakfast, she sent the translated medical record to Steven.At this moment.Aunt Miao walked over unhappily and glanced at the person on the sofa in disgust. \u201cMs. Yunge, this woman doesn\u2019t seem to have any manners. If you don\u2019t like her, why don\u2019t you change her?\u201dHow could Aunt Miao not know what that woman was thinking after seeing her actions just now?Madam would definitely not like someone who looked so devilish!\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dPei Yunge smirked, not really bothered by it.\u201cBut will this woman teach you properly?\u201d Aunt Miao furrowed her eyebrows.\u201cLet\u2019s give it a try first. Aunt Miao, there\u2019s nothing much today, so you should go and rest.\u201dHearing this, Aunt Miao laughed helplessly. \u201cAlright, you have to watch over this woman. Don\u2019t let her have her way.\u201dBefore leaving, Aunt Miao even gave Pei Yunge a meaningful look, one that was filled with encouragement and determination.Perplexed, Pei Yunge stopped using her chopsticks.\u2026More than half an hour had passed by the time Pei Yunge finished her breakfast slowly.Beside the coffee table in the living room.The woman got Pei Yunge to take out her book first.As soon as she flipped open the exercise book, she saw all the glaring mistakes she had made. It was difficult for her to even look through them. A glint of sarcasm flashed past her eyes.Her face was not bad, but she was really an idiot.Thereafter, the woman smiled. It was hard to hide the scorn in her voice. \u201cMiss, it\u2019s very difficult for you to grasp the subjects well with a foundation like yours.\u201d\u201cTherefore, I will be more strict during the upcoming tutoring sessions. I hope you can cooperate as much as possible.\u201dWith that said, she casually opened a book and threw it to Pei Yunge. \u201cCopy the knowledge points ten times first.

She could only stare at Pei Yunge darkly.Her daily salary was more than ten times the market rate.Therefore, even if Master Du was not involved, this job was still very attractive.Pei Yunge\u2019s pretty eyes curled up, looking even more gentle. \u201cSo, it\u2019s best if Teacher is obedient.\u201dThe woman\u2019s eyes accidentally met with Pei Yunge\u2019s. In that moment, she felt an inexplicable chill down her spine.At last, the woman didn\u2019t dare to let Pei Yunge copy anymore. Instead, she took the exercise book and started explaining randomly, thinking that Pei Yunge knew nothing.Until noon.When Aunt Miao asked Pei Yunge to have lunch, the woman sneaked out of the main gate and called Ceng Xu, before she tattled on Pei Yunge ruthlessly.\u2026In the corporation.When Huo Shidu finished listening, he did not even bat an eyelid. His tone was light.\u201cChange to the tutor.\u201dHearing this, Ceng Xu could not help but glance at Huo Shidu.If this happened to Little Young Master, he would probably be punished.But when it came to Ms. Pei, he actually switched the tutor immediately!??(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)\u201cMaster Du, shall we change to a more good-looking male tutor?\u201dCeng Xu was being a smart alec. \u201cGirls are more obedient when there are attractive males.\u201dThe man\u2019s eyelids lifted slightly. His laughter sounded a little cold and inexplicably dangerous.\u201cYou sure know how to please her.\u201dCeng Xu felt his scalp tingle and he regained his senses immediately!He immediately corrected himself. \u201cActually, Miss Pei is prone to temptation at this age. I think it\u2019s better if she\u2019s taught by a female!\u201dAfter hearing this, Huo Shidu glanced at him calmly. The atmosphere was way too oppressive.As the man looked down, Ceng Xu heaved a sigh of relief. Just then, he heard him say something carelessly.\u201cCome back with me later.\u201dThe moment Ceng Xu heard this, he understood that Huo Shidu wanted to go back and visit Pei Yunge.\u201cYes.\u201d\u2026In the afternoon.Pei Yunge continued to be tutored, while the woman was obviously distracted. She also got several of the questions wrong.Suddenly.The woman\u2019s eyes lit up when she saw the figure outside the door. She immediately turned to look at Pei Yunge.\u201cDid you understand the question just now?\u201dPei Yunge had just replied to the computing institute. Thereafter, she glanced at the question.Her tone was perfunctory. \u201cMm.\u201d\u201cThen explain to me once.\u201d A strange glint flashed in the woman\u2019s eyes.Pei Yunge raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to?\u201dAt this moment, Huo Shidu and Assistant Ceng, who had just walked in, heard these few sentences.Assistant Ceng\u2019s eyelid could not help twitching.If Little Young Master had the attitude of Ms. Pei, Master Du might fill Little Young Master\u2019s schedule to the brim with classes.\u201cMiss Pei, I\u2019ve already explained this question. With your attitude now, you won\u2019t learn even if I repeat it a hundred times,\u201d the woman said aggrievedly.Pei Yunge did not speak. From the corner of her eye, she saw the man walking over.\u201cBrother.\u201dPei Yunge\u2019s eyes curved. Her gaze was very clear. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201dEven if he was angry, he would be appeased by this harmless appearance.\u201cYou don\u2019t understand the questions?\u201dHuo Shidu walked towards Pei Yunge.Before Pei Yunge could speak, the woman blurted out an explanation. \u201cIt\u2019s Miss\u2019s attitude that\u2019s not right.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There were several exercise books on the coffee table.There was also a bottle of milk by the side.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe corners of Pei Yunge\u2019s lips twitched.

The atmosphere was tense and gloomy.Suddenly.Hearing a noise not too far away, Huo Shidu turned around and saw Pei Yunge picking up a pen.Seeing the complicated gaze shown in her bright eyes, the man\u2019s thin red lips curled up imperceptibly.She was still a young lady after all.However, at this moment, the higher-ups who saw Huo Shidu\u2019s expression widened their eyes as they stared at this scene in disbelief.They couldn\u2019t hear what was happening over there, but they could see President Huo\u2019s expression clearly.President Huo smiled?!(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)Why was there an inexplicable doting look on his face!?Wasn\u2019t this smile too sweet?!!One by one, the female executives felt as if their teenage hearts had been attacked in a long time!However, before long, everyone suddenly realized that their President\u2019s background was the office.Wait a minute, did President Huo bring her to the company?Suddenly.Huo Shidu\u2019s low and calm voice could be heard.\u201cWe can start now.\u201dInstantly, everyone regained their senses and their desire for gossip was extinguished.It was only a matter of time before they found out about the gossip.

She was actually only 18 or 19 years old?!In that case, wouldn\u2019t this old man be even more arrogant and smug when Pei Yunge grew up?!Marcus felt bitter.

As for a certain someone, I think she\u2019s just someone that people despise.\u201d\u2026By the time Pei Yunge reached the door, she had heard enough of these words.However, what Pei Yunge did not expect was that before she could walk in, she heard a table and chair colliding.Chu Zhixing\u2019s furious voice sounded. \u201cWhat right do you have to talk about Pei Yunge?! At least she won\u2019t hurt others behind their backs!\u201dHearing this, Pei Yunge, who was at the door, froze as well.Before, Chu Zhixing had said that he wanted to follow her. However, she was a reserved person, so she had rejected him.However, she never thought that Chu Zhigou would speak up for her at this time.Soon.A few girls who were chattering away turned red in the face and glared at Chu Zhixing.\u201cWe\u2019re not qualified? Doesn\u2019t Pei Yunge want to be talked about by everyone?\u201dThe pretty girl said harshly, \u201cWhat right does she have to take Qin Youjiao\u2019s things? Why doesn\u2019t she look at what she is!\u201dAnother person laughed coldly. \u201cDisgusting! I really didn\u2019t expect that there would still be Pei Yunge\u2019s pug.\u201dAt this moment.The girls\u2019 words became more ruthless, but they did not notice that Pei Yunge had casually swept a strand of black hair behind her back.As she fiddled with her slender and fair index finger, she walked over casually and raised her pretty eyes lazily.\u201cContinue.\u201dThe moment Pei Yunge\u2019s voice rang, several girls who were gossiping behind her froze as their faces paled!It was as if they didn\u2019t expect Pei Yunge to come so early!(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)\u201cXiaochu, are you too free?\u201dPei Yunge walked towards Chu Zhixing and asked calmly.The moment Chu Zhixing heard her words, he thought that Pei Yunge was blaming him for being a busybody and his body froze.However, in the next second, the pretty and ostentatious girl laughed lazily. \u201cA helpful and good citizen? You have to take care of all the animals in school.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dChu Zhixing regained his senses and pursed his lips, suppressing his laughter with difficulty.As for those girls, their faces turned red instantly!\u201cPei Yunge! What do you mean?!\u201d\u201cStudent, don\u2019t misunderstand. It means exactly what you are thinking.\u201dPei Yunge sat in her seat. Her tone was polite, but her words were as brazen as her person.\u201cYou!\u201dThe girl glared at Pei Yunge as she gritted her teeth.Suddenly.A voice sounded from the door. \u201cWhat are you arguing about? What exactly are you arguing about?!\u201dEveryone turned around and found that it was the dean.He glanced at everyone with a dark expression. \u201cI heard all of you from the corridor! Can you all get full marks for the college entrance examination?\u201dPei Yunge turned her head and gave Chu Zhixing a few sweets. Then she pulled up her hat and got ready to sleep.However, in the dean\u2019s eyes, this scene was simply a thorn in his flesh!!This Pei Yunge was even more reckless than Lu Yuansi!\u201cPei Yunge, what are you planning to do?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m crying. I was pretty upset because I got scolded by my classmates just now.\u201dWith that said, Pei Yunge slowly fell asleep on the table.The girls were speechless.Instantly, the dean\u2019s expression turned livid!He already knew that Pei Yunge was a tactful yet rebellious person. She was difficult and troublesome to deal with!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85: Miss Qin\u2019s IdentityHowever\u2026At the thought of Pei Yunge\u2019s identity, the dean held it in. He only glanced at Pei Yunge with disgust before he left with a cold expression.It was no wonder the Qin family only recognized her when she was so old. The Qin family probably felt that they could not afford to lose face like this!The whole school knew that Qin Youjiao was a fair, rich, and beautiful girl with excellent results. On the other hand, Pei Yunge was quickly recognized by everyone because she injured Qian Chengjun.Therefore, in Hengde High School, almost everyone felt that Qin Youjiao and Pei Yunge were worlds apart.Not long after the dean left, Pei Yunge took off her hat and opened her textbook. There was an iPad in it.\u201cStudent Pei, didn\u2019t you want to sleep?\u201d Chu Zhixing couldn\u2019t help asking when he saw that Pei Yunge was awake.\u201cI can\u2019t sleep,\u201d Pei Yunge said.Chu Zhixing immediately understood that Pei Yunge just didn\u2019t want to see the dean.\u2026After the first period was over.Everyone had different thoughts when they saw Lu Yuansi return. Many of them glanced at Pei Yunge gloatingly.Who didn\u2019t know that Lu Yuansi liked Qin Youjiao?!Others would take into account the Qin family or Pei Yunge\u2019s past actions and wouldn\u2019t dare to have any conflict with her, but Lu Yuansi wouldn\u2019t.At this moment.Everyone could not help sneaking glances at Lu Yuansi and Pei Yunge. Even Chu Zhixing became nervous.They saw Lu Yuansi walk towards Pei Yunge without any expression on his face.\u201cAre you done with your homework? Let me copy it.\u201d Lu Yuansi sounded a little gloomy, as if he had just woken up.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you borrow it from others?\u201dPei Yunge furrowed her eyebrows.Lu Yuansi said matter-of-factly, \u201cIt\u2019s more suitable to copy from someone of the similar standard as me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPei Yunge threw the homework on his desk and was too lazy to say much more.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)However\u2026Seeing this, everyone else was stunned!Why didn\u2019t Lu Yuansi pick a fight with Pei Yunge and even seemed to have a good relationship with her?!Ling Jiwei, who had picked a fight with Pei Yunge before, could not help speaking up, her tone bitter. \u201cYuansi, do you not know her identity?\u201dIn the past, Lu Yuansi was the most protective of Qin Youjiao. But now, he actually didn\u2019t care that Pei Yunge had taken Qin Youjiao\u2019s things!He was even closer to Pei Yunge than anyone in class!Lu Yuansi glanced at her indifferently before returning to his seat.Seeing that Lu Yuansi ignored her, Ling Jiwei\u2019s voice was laced with sarcasm as she roared, \u201cShe\u2019s the Qin family\u2019s illegitimate daughter!!\u201dLu Yuansi\u2019s eyes turned cold as he slowly looked at her and snorted. \u201cWhat does it have to do with me?\u201dHe already knew about this.But whether Pei Yunge was the Qin family\u2019s illegitimate daughter or not, it wasn\u2019t Pei Yunge\u2019s fault.Besides, this new deskmate of his was much more pleasing to the eye than those girls who gossiped every day, even though her temper was quite terrible.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ling Jiwei\u2019s face paled instantly.Soon.Pei Yunge laughed and glanced at Ling Jiwei with amusement. \u201cDid Qin Youjiao tell you?\u201dSeeing Pei Yunge staring at her, Ling Jiwei suppressed her inexplicable fear and questioned, \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201dPei Yunge raised an eyebrow, as if she had just thought of an interesting joke. \u201cIllegitimate daughter? Seems like a more acceptable title than \u2018Eldest Young Miss Qin\u2019.\u201dThese words confused everyone else.What did Pei Yunge mean?!However, Lu Yuansi\u2019s hand froze and his eyes darkened slightly as he glanced at Pei Yunge once more.However, in the next second, everyone\u2019s thoughts were interrupted by a girl running in from outside.\u201cStudent Lu, Youjiao is hiding in the bathroom.

After that, even Cheng Zihuai, the school beau of the third year of high school, rushed over immediately after learning of this.Everyone could not help but feel envious. What Qin Youjiao had was the script of a proper female protagonist and was treated like a treasure by every Prince Charming!In the infirmary.Cheng Zihuai\u2019s handsome face darkened as he clenched his fists. \u201cI knew it. This matter has something to do with Pei Yunge.\u201dHearing Cheng Zihuai say this, Lu Yuansi could not help sneering coldly. \u201cCheng Zihuai, you don\u2019t have to push the blame on my deskmate.\u201d\u201cWhy? Is your heart aching for her?\u201dCheng Zihuai stared at him coldly.It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t know that Lu Yuansi\u2019s feelings for Qin Youjiao was special, but it was also his first time seeing him defend another girl.\u201cNo. I just think that you have a lot of prejudice against her.\u201dLu Yuansi\u2019s lips curled into a mocking smile. After glancing at him, he turned around and left as well.He and Cheng Zihuai never liked each other to begin with, and neither did they have the habit of saying goodbye before leaving.At this moment, Cheng Zihuai gritted his teeth and sent Pei Yunge a message.\u2018Pei Yunge, you\u2019re really capable.\u2019These words could not hide his annoyance and sarcasm.However, she replied a few minutes later.\u201cDo I need you to tell me?\u201dIn an instant, Cheng Zihuai\u2019s expression was extremely dark!Just as Cheng Zihuai\u2019s temper rose and he was about to settle things with Pei Yunge, a weak voice suddenly sounded from the side.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)\u201cZihuai, why are you here\u2026\u201dThe ruthlessness in Cheng Zihuai\u2019s eyes dissipated as he looked at Qin Youjiao. His tone became gentle. \u201cShouldn\u2019t I be here? Why don\u2019t you take good care of yourself? Why did you do such a stupid thing?\u201dHearing this, Qin Youjiao couldn\u2019t help but cry. \u201cMy Third Brother and Grandpa don\u2019t want me anymore. They\u2019ve both changed. They only like Pei Yunge.\u201dAfter Qin Lang found out about how Pei Yunge had been being attacked the day before, no matter what she said, Qin Lang was sure that she was definitely involved in this matter.He even got someone to throw her things out and forbade her from staying at home.Later, if it wasn\u2019t for Mrs Qin rushing over, she wouldn\u2019t even know where she was going to stay.After Cheng Zihuai heard Qin Youjiao\u2019s complaints, he frowned unhappily. \u201cEnough, Jiaojiao. Your Third Brother probably heard what Pei Yunge said.\u201dDon\u2019t worry, your Third Brother will definitely regret doing this. \u201dQin Youjiao\u2019s tears kept flowing, making one\u2019s heart ache for her. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t know what to do now. Third Brother has never treated me like this in the past\u2026\u201dCheng Zihuai thought for a long time before a dark look flashed in his eyes. He wrapped his arm around Qin Youjiao\u2019s shoulder and said with a reassuring smile, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you only have Third Brother left?\u201d\u201cYour Third Brother is the youngest and is easily deceived. But Eldest Brother and Second Brother are not people who are easily deceived. I heard that your Second Brother returned to the country today.\u201d\u201cReally?!\u201dQin Youjiao, who had been sobbing non-stop, had her eyes lit up now!It was her Second Brother, Qin Yu. Actually, she rarely saw him because Qin Yu had severed ties with his family and gone to develop himself in the entertainment industry after he had just turned legal.However, no one expected that in just four years, Qin Yu would become the current famous Best Actor Sanqi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Perhaps it was because Qin Yu\u2019s attitude towards the original protagonist was considered gentle and kind.But in the original novel, Second Brother\u2019s ending was the worst. He was rumored to have a fetish for children and ended up with his face disfigured by sulfuric acid splashed on him by his fans.Pei Yunge\u2019s eyes darkened but she replied anyway.[I\u2019m not free.]The moment the message was sent, the person on the other end replied to Pei Yunge very quickly.[Then Second Brother will come and get you after school?

I\u2019ve really troubled you during this period.\u201dThere was no response from the other end of the line. He did not know if it was because the signal was not good.Suddenly.The man\u2019s voice sounded once more. His light and graceful tone became even more magnetic under the weak frequency. \u201cDid that child agree?\u201dQin Yu\u2019s expression froze, but he quickly smiled. \u201cOf course she will agree!\u201dWho knew\u2026The man on the other end of the line laughed ambiguously before he hung up the call.Qin Yu was perplexed.Was he being ridiculed?\u2026The exit passageway.The fans outside filled the entire venue.It was only when a handsome man walked out that the screams from the fans became even louder!Qin Yu was wearing a white T-shirt that was casually tucked into his black pants. It accentuated his broad shoulders and narrow waist, making him look extremely fit.His ink-like eyes were arrogant and superior. With his short black hair combed back and a loose strand curled around his forehead, he looked inexplicably sexy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s a pity that I can\u2019t fetch him because of school.\u201dThe girl sounded disappointed, but after a moment, she said enviously, \u201cHowever, I heard from the sisters on the front lines that Qin Yu said he has a sister today! He even brought his sister a toy bear. I\u2019m so jealous!\u201dHearing this, Qin Youjiao was a little surprised, but the corners of her lips could not help but turn up.Second Brother who had probably brought her a present.Qin Youjiao patted her shoulder. \u201cAlright, if you really like him, I\u2019ll see if I can get you an autographed picture.\u201d\u201cReally?

He was here to pick her up. He probably wanted to prepare a surprise for her, right?!\u201cSecond Brother, why do you always like to pull a prank on people?\u201dQin Youqin said coyly.Qin Yu turned around and frowned when he saw that it was Qin Youjiao.\u201cWhy is it you?\u201d His tone was displeased.Before Qin Youjiao could react, she thought Qin Yu was teasing her.Then her eyes fell on the toy bear in Qin Yu\u2019s paper bag.He was still pretending to be cold to her!Why didn\u2019t he hide the gift he had bought for her?!At this thought, Qin Youjiao could not help but jump for joy.

Qin Yu came to fetch Pei Yunge?!\u201d\u201cOh my god! I thought Qin Yu came to pick up Qin Youjiao\u2026\u201dAfter all, wasn\u2019t she the publicly acknowledged little princess of the Qin family?\u201cHey, did you guys notice that Qin Yu and Qin Lang didn\u2019t say much to Qin Youjiao just now? Qin Youjiao doesn\u2019t seem to be as doted on as the rumors say\u2026\u201dThat passionate hug from Qin Yu just now was really shocking and enviable.After all, Qin Yu never stirred up any rumors in the industry. It could be said that this was the first time they saw Qin Yu getting close to the \u2018opposite sex\u2019.After that, someone retorted, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to make things difficult for Elder Young Miss, is there? No matter what, Qin Youjiao has stayed in the Qin family for almost twenty years.\u201cWhen did Pei Yunge return? How can she compare to Youjiao? \u201dMany people thought about it and agreed with what was said.A fair, rich, and beautiful woman like Qin Youjiao, who had excellent character and brains, was more likable than Pei Yunge no matter how one looked at it.At this moment, Pei Yunge\u2019s body froze when she was suddenly hugged by someone.\u201c\u2026Can you let go now?\u201dPei Yunge raised her eyes slightly before she said calmly.Hearing this, Qin Yu immediately let go of Pei Yunge and hid the paper bag behind him.\u201cGe\u2019er, guess what Second Brother bought you?\u201dPei Yunge\u2019s eyebrows moved and she glanced at Qin Yu, whose eyes were shining brightly. She could not help but smile.\u201cDiamonds?\u201dQin Youjiao had a preference for collecting diamonds, so Qin Yu would often buy these for Qin Youjiao as a gift. However, he had always prepared them for the original protagonist as well.However, a dense man like Qin Yu really didn\u2019t seem like he would pay attention to what girls liked. He always thought that girls liked the same things.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPei Yunge just stared at him silently.Seeing this, Qin Chu immediately cowered.He took out the paper bag and handed it to Pei Yunge happily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91: Bear Is Very Cute, Will You Take It?At this moment, Lu Yuansi, who had just left school, witnessed this scene.It was his first time seeing his deskmate, who was usually reckless and uninhibited, silent. Her expressionless face exuded a conflict from the depths of her soul.Lu Yuansi couldn\u2019t help but cover his mouth and laugh.This gift was indeed not suitable for a deskmate as cool as her.Soon.Pei Yunge also spoke and rejected with a smile. \u201cThank you, but I don\u2019t like this kind of toy. It\u2019s better if you give it to someone else.\u201dAt this moment, Pei Yunge thought that Qin Yu had prepared the same gift as Qin Youjiao for her.However, Pei Yunge really did not like it.Especially when it came to this kind of stupid bear that she couldn\u2019t find fault with.\u201cNo, I bought this especially for Ge\u2019er.\u201d Qin Yu rejected her straight away, his handsome eyes filled with seriousness.He bent down slightly to look at Pei Yunge at eye level, before he coaxed her in a low voice, \u201cGe\u2019er, this bear is very cute. Will you take it?\u201dInstantly!The girls around them lost their minds and almost couldn\u2019t hold back their screams!Where did this godly brother come from? Why was he so good-looking?!Their HP bars were going to empty again!!At this moment, Qin Lang\u2019s handsome face darkened, filled with jealousy.Haha.So what if you filmed a few idol dramas?!He actually flirted with his biological younger sister! Qin Yu, that b*stard!!\u201c\u2026\u201dPei Yunge\u2019s eyelids twitched. After feeling the intense gazes around her, she wanted to draw a line between herself and this stupid bear.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to eat?\u201d Pei Yunge interrupted Qin Yu\u2019s words casually.However, Qin Yu\u2019s mood became better when he heard this.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)Ge\u2019er asked him out for a meal.Ge\u2019er had almost forgiven him!\u201cOkay, Second Brother has already booked a restaurant.\u201dWith that said, Qin Yu glanced at Qin Lang intentionally or otherwise and smiled gently. \u201cHowever, I only reserved two seats.\u201dQin Lang was speechless.Was there anyone more inhumane than Qin Yu?\u201cSecond Brother, are you going with Pei Yunge?\u201dQin Youjiao clenched her fists. There was anger suppressed in her eyes. She was so jealous that she was about to lose her senses.Second Brother had always been indifferent to her.Back then, when she wanted Second Brother to bring her to meet his friends, he always changed the subject and never agreed to it.But now, Second Brother was actually here to pick Pei Yunge up?!He even bought Pei Yunge a present and coaxed her like this\u2026Even if it was in the past, she had never received such treatment before.\u201cIsn\u2019t that normal? I only have one biological sister, so I have to dote on her a little.\u201dQin Yu looked up and said slowly.These words made Qin Youjiao\u2019s face turn pale. The people around them were even more stunned and confused.\u201cWhat does Qin Yu mean? What do you mean by only having one biological sister? Is he talking about Pei Yunge?\u201d\u201cI think so\u2026 Did I hear wrongly?\u201d\u201cImpossible, Qin Yu definitely doesn\u2019t mean that. Qin Youjiao didn\u2019t enter the Qin family midway. She grew up in the Qin family and is a genuine young lady!\u201dQin Youjiao had been the center of attention since she was a child, so she naturally had a group of supporters.\u2026The discussion in the crowd was very soft, but Qin Lang, who was the closest to the crowd, heard it.Qin Lang frowned as coldness filled his eyes. He was about to speak when he heard Qin Yu ask, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your arm?\u201dInstinctively, Qin Lang turned around and saw Pei Yunge staring at his forearm. Instantly, he became nervous.However, a few seconds later, Pei Yunge\u2019s gaze moved away calmly, causing Qin Lang\u2019s heart to feel empty.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92: Fighting for Love In Front of Pei YungeHearing this, Qin Yu frowned unconsciously.Pei Yunge also glanced at Qin Lang.The scratch on his arm was not light at all. It was almost unbearable to look at and there were even some bruises on his arm.Suddenly.Qin Yu remembered that Qin Lang must have angered Mrs Qin by making Qin Youjiao move out.His voice was slightly cold. \u201cDid Mom\u2026 do it?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you going for a meal? I have something on, so I\u2019ll go back first.\u201dQin Lang interrupted him and was about to leave when he stopped.He glanced at Pei Yunge and said in a low voice, \u201cGe\u2019er, I\u2019m investigating the things on the Internet. As for your identity\u2026 I\u2019ll clarify it for you in a few days.\u201dActually, Qin Yu and Qin Lang wanted to post a post to clarify this matter the moment this issue surfaced.In the end, he was banned for three days and could not log in to his account at all\u2026Therefore, Qin Yu and Qin Lang rushed to find Pei Yunge, afraid that Pei Yunge would be upset and hate them even more.\u201cNo need,\u201d Pei Yunge said calmly.If she didn\u2019t care about the original protagonist\u2019s grandfather, she wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with the Qin family either.Qin Lang\u2019s eyes darkened and he remained silent.\u201cYou\u2019d better treat the wound on your arm.\u201dThere was no emotion in Pei Yunge\u2019s tone either.She had said something indifferently, but this made Qin Lang\u2019s dimmed eyes lit up once more.\u201cOkay. Ge\u2019er, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m fine.\u201dBeside them, Qin Yu glanced at the smiling Qin Lang with some disdain.However, at the thought that Mrs Qin actually hit Qin Lang because of Qin Youjiao, Qin Yu\u2019s eyes turned cold.Not long after, his emotions dissipated. \u201cGe\u2019er, let\u2019s go. Second Brother will take you out for a meal.\u201dAt this moment.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)When everyone saw this, almost everyone thought that they had seen fake news back then! Didn\u2019t they say that Qin Youjiao was especially doted on in the Qin family?!Why did it feel like these two brothers were fighting for attention and love in front of Pei Yunge instead of Qin Youjiao?!\u201cSecond Brother, you two can go and have your meals first. I\u2019m not feeling too well, so you don\u2019t have to worry about me.\u201dQin Youjiao\u2019s voice was intentionally amplified so that everyone could hear her clearly.However, in the next moment, Qin Yu glanced at her indifferently and chuckled. \u201cI didn\u2019t plan to care about you either.\u201dHearing this, Qin Youjiao\u2019s body froze and her wide eyes slowly watered as she stared at Qin Yu in disbelief.At first, she thought that Third Brother was already too much. She never thought that Second Brother would make her feel even more disappointed!\u201cLet\u2019s go and eat.\u201dPei Yunge was not interested in being a monkey in a circus.However, when Qin Yu looked at Pei Yunge, the coldness in his eyes disappeared and he said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019ll listen to Ge\u2019er.\u201dQin Youjiao stared at Qin Yu and Pei Yunge\u2019s back views in disbelief. Her shoulders shivered slightly as the humiliation she felt intensified.How could this be!?In the past, the brothers were clearly indifferent to Pei Yunge, but now, Pei Yunge had become the apple of Second Brother and Third Brother\u2019s eyes!\u201cYoujiao?\u201dBehind her, Lu Yuansi, thinking that Qin Youjiao was crying, came up to look at her.\u201cOh, it\u2019s Student Lu.\u201dQin Youjiao\u2019s eyes were slightly red as she said, \u201cThank you for today. I didn\u2019t think that I would faint\u2026\u201d\u201cIs something bothering you? I\u2019ve never seen you like this before.\u201dQin Youjiao bit her lip, unwillingness hidden in her eyes. \u201cIs it that no matter how outstanding I become, I can\u2019t be compared with Pei Yunge?\u201dSo, Qin Youjiao hoped that Lu Yuansi could comfort her.However, Lu Yuansi thought for a moment and said, \u201cShe\u2019s different.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He asked lazily, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I didn\u2019t expect you to call me.\u201dThe man\u2019s tone was indifferent as he said carelessly, \u201cYun Nuo came to the company to look for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Qin Yu\u2019s smile froze.Was this woman too determined?But then\u2026He said slowly, \u201cShe knows which restaurant you\u2019re going to. If you\u2019re afraid of trouble, you can go to the one under Huo Corporation.\u201dThe moment Qin Yu heard this, he was instantly filled with gratitude towards Huo Shidu.He never thought that Master Du actually cared about him.Qin Yu smiled politely. \u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll thank you first.

Did he think that he wanted someone to disturb them?!Qin Yu took a deep breath and put on a fake smile. \u201cIs that so? Alright. We haven\u2019t eaten together in a long time anyway.\u201dAfter hanging up the call, Qin Yu tried to calm himself down. Master Du wouldn\u2019t do something so humiliating on purpose. He probably really thought he was inviting them warmly.\u201cGe\u2019er, do you mind if someone else joins us for the meal?\u201dQin Yu turned his head and asked carefully.Indeed, he did not expect Huo Shidu to agree so readily.No matter how much he asked Huo Shidu to hang out in the past, Huo Shidu never bothered with him.\u201cAnything is fine,\u201d Pei Yunge said.Hearing this, Qin Yu let out a sigh of relief.However, right after that, Qin Yu suddenly remembered something.Wasn\u2019t Ge\u2019er staying with Master Du?!These two people definitely knew each other!Qin Yu thought for a moment and asked subtly, \u201cGe\u2019er, are you\u2026 okay with your living arrangement now?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s pretty good.\u201dPei Yunge answered.\u201cThat\u2019s good, that\u2019s good.\u201d Qin Yu coughed lightly.He did not know if Huo Shidu had told Ge\u2019er that he was the one who asked him to take care of Ge\u2019er.If Ge\u2019er felt that the two of them had teamed up to lie to her, then it would really be over\u2026At this thought, Qin Yu became even more nervous, not knowing how to bring this up to Pei Yunge.\u2026After they got out of the car, Qin Yu led Pei Yunge into a restaurant. They were welcomed into a private room.After the waiter pushed open the door of the private room, he found that a man with elegant eyes was already sitting inside.Qin Yu was perplexed.Wasn\u2019t he too quick?He thought that Master Du would be late\u2026Then\u2026Pei Yunge\u2019s sudden words made Qin Yu freeze even more.\u201cBrother?\u201dConfused, Qin Yu looked at Pei Yunge.Who was Ge\u2019er calling?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was as if she suddenly understood what was going on.It turned out that these two people already knew each other. That was why Huo Shidu brought her back then.\u201cGe\u2019er, you\u2026\u201dQin Yu turned to look at Pei Yunge. Before he could finish asking, he saw Pei Yunge\u2019s ambiguous gaze and his mouth immediately snapped shut.\u201cI see.\u201dPei Yunge\u2019s eyes were curled up and her tone was normal, but it somehow made Qin Yu even more panicked.He was doomed.Ge\u2019er was definitely angry!At this moment, Pei Yunge did not say much and just chose a seat beside her. Her bright and beautiful face was calm and composed.She said, \u201cLet\u2019s eat first.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dQin Yu nodded and sat beside Pei Yunge nervously. He could not help but sneak a glance at her.This action made Huo Shidu, who was beside him, glance at him casually.After the dishes were served, Pei Yunge glanced at the dishes. They were all her usual favorites.\u201cGe\u2019er, try this. It\u2019ll definitely be delicious!\u201dQin Yu kept putting food into Pei Yunge\u2019s bowl. \u201cAnd this\u2026 this too!\u201dWithin minutes, Pei Yunge\u2019s bowl was filled to the brim.The corners of her lips twitched.

Master Du, what do we do? What do we do?\u201d\u201cDo you want to know?\u201dThe collar of Huo Shidu\u2019s shirt was unbuttoned, and his fair neckline stretched into his firm and sexy chest. His posture was languid and graceful.His thin eyelids lifted and his upturned eyes were charming. \u201cLeave early after eating this meal.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhy did he have the guts to say that as if his sister had become his??Qin Yu couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhat about you?\u201dThe corners of Huo Shidu\u2019s thin and red lips curled up. His low and magnetic voice made people blush and their hearts thump faster, making him look frivolous and attractive.\u201cMe? Let\u2019s talk to the little girl and see if it\u2019s okay.\u201dAfter hearing this, Qin Yu froze for a second before he felt touched again.He was a true brother!He really did not expect Master Du to lower himself and humor the little girl for his brother.He had really misunderstood him in the past.After feeling guilty for a while, Qin Yu reminded him, \u201cOkay. Master Du, if you really can\u2019t come to an agreement, don\u2019t be angry. Girls\u2026 It\u2019s normal for them to have a little temper.\u201dHe was a little afraid too. With Huo Shidu\u2019s temper, if he was provoked by Ge\u2019er, wouldn\u2019t it be like offending the King of Hell\u2026\u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave now?\u201d Huo Shidu asked slowly.Qin Yu was speechless.\u2026When Pei Yunge returned, only Huo Shidu was left in the private room.The corners of her eyes lifted as she walked towards the dining table and asked, \u201cWhere is he?\u201dHuo Shidu\u2019s slender fingers were stained with red oil as he was peeling the prawn shell slowly.

His cold fingers were stained with red oil as he deliberately caressed the side of her lips.His lazy and sexy appearance was both provocative and ambiguous. \u201cIt\u2019s Older Brother\u2019s first time charging you, do you want to try it?\u201dPei Yunge, \u201c\u2026\u201dShe shouldn\u2019t have said anything more to him.Taking a deep breath, she wiped the red oil off her lips without any expression on her face. Then she turned around, planning to continue eating.Then\u2026Before she could look down, a slender and pretty hand placed the peeled prawns in her bowl.The man\u2019s magnetic voice sounded pleased as it sounded beside Pei Yunge\u2019s ear. It was incredibly sexy.\u201cOlder Brother is joking. I just want Yunyun to talk to Older Brother.

Don\u2019t be angry with Older Brother anymore?\u201dThe man\u2019s pleasant voice had a certain charm to it and was hard to reject.However, when Pei Yunge heard his words, she only glanced at Huo Shidu, smiled at him, and continued eating.Seeing this, Huo Shidu was not in a hurry either. The corners of his lips curled up and he started to peel the prawn shell slowly again. From time to time, he fed the prawn to the girl beside him, who was not easy to please.It was as if he was coaxing his little ancestor.This thought suddenly appeared in the man\u2019s mind and he couldn\u2019t help but chuckle as he glanced at Pei Yunge playfully.Pei Yunge was busy eating and did not notice the expression of the person beside her.\u2026After leaving the restaurant.Pei Yunge sat in the front passenger\u2019s seat and focused on using her phone.Suddenly, his phone vibrated.Beside her, Huo Shidu suddenly said casually, \u201cYunyun, help Older Brother check the notification.\u201dAfter Pei Yunge glanced at him, she picked up Huo Shidu\u2019s phone. She heard him say his passcode immediately.She clicked on the message and read it out. After the man hummed softly, she put the phone back.Through the rearview mirror, he glanced at the little girl who looked a little cold beside him and his lips curled up subconsciously. \u201cThank you, Yunyun.\u201dThe young lady was indeed someone who held grudges.Pei Yunge hummed in acknowledgment and was about to continue using her phone.However, Huo Shidu, who was beside her, suddenly took out a few candies from the side and unwrapped the candy wrapper with one hand.\u201cYunyun.\u201dHearing this, Pei Yunge turned her head instinctively. She was about to say something when she was suddenly fed a piece of candy.The strawberry-flavored milk candy was soft and sweet as it slowly melted between her lips and teeth.Pei Yunge, \u201c\u2026\u201dAfter that\u2026Before Pei Yunge could do anything, she heard the man say slowly, \u201cIf Yunyun doesn\u2019t give Older Brother some face, Older Brother has prepared everything in the trunk for Yunyun.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, there was indulgence in his gentle eyes.Pei Yunge had got out of the car.Huo Shidu had just parked his car when he saw Pei Yunge about to turn around and walk home.Taking a few steps forward, he grabbed Pei Yunge\u2019s wrist and pulled her back.At this moment.When Pei Yunge turned around, she saw the man up close, his eyes darkening as his magnetic and lazy voice made the wind in her ears flutter.\u201cDo you have a heart, child? Are you really ignoring me?\u201dPei Yunge froze for some reason.After that, Huo Shidu bent his long legs and half-knelt on one knee. His warm and dry palm was still holding onto her wrist.The man looked up at her with his pale-colored pupils. He laughed carelessly as he coaxed her intimately and naturally.\u201cYunyun?\u201dHis voice trailed off and his upturned eyes were even more charming. His deep and indulgent tone was so flirtatious that it made one\u2019s heart speed up. \u201cOlder Brother is begging for forgiveness, okay?\u201dIt was a scene that would make many turn into jelly.Even Pei Yunge\u2019s heart almost skipped a beat.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)Was this man too good at sweet-talking?\u2026Huo Shidu did not explain much just now. He only said that they had met at the hospital and bar by chance. However, he did agree to Qin Yu\u2019s request after that.Hearing this, Pei Yunge\u2019s anger had actually dissipated a long time ago. After all, she wasn\u2019t someone who would create trouble for herself.After the two of them returned to the living room, the man passed the paper bag to Pei Yunge. \u201cQin Yu left this behind just now.\u201d\u201dSeeing the bear in the paper bag, Pei Yunge\u2019s eyes twitched uncontrollably.Seeing that she did not take it, Huo Shidu chuckled. \u201cDo you dislike it that much?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201dPei Yunge mentally prepared herself and took the paper bag as well as the toy bear in it. \u201cIt\u2019s just not too appropriate.\u201dHearing this, the man chuckled and looked at her with amusement. \u201cQin Yu knows that you have insomnia. He said\u2026 that you like to sleep with this in your arms.\u201dPei Yunge, \u201c\u2026\u201dWhat nonsense.However\u2026Seeing this, Huo Shidu playfully scratched Pei Yunge\u2019s chin and laughed happily and frivolously. \u201cYunyun, don\u2019t worry.

No one will laugh at you.\u201dPei Yunge smiled at him. \u201cOlder Brother, you\u2019re smiling.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dThe man\u2019s eyes were clear and cold, but he lowered his voice and laughed, his posture languid and sexy. \u201cBut Older Brother will smile whenever I see Yunyun.\u201dPei Yunge, \u201c\u2026\u201dSoon.With that said, Pei Yunge went upstairs and brought along this toy bear that was incompatible with her style.Sitting by the bed, Pei Yunge stared at the bear she had placed on the bedside table.Actually, the teddy bear was quite cute. Its soft brown short fur made people want to touch it.It was very adorable.Pei Yunge\u2019s eyebrows moved, before she turned her eyes away, trying her best to ignore it.At the same time.There was a bloodbath online as well.The top three headlines were all talking about them because the topic of discussion had included Qin Yu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97: Treatment of a Biological Daughter# Qin Yu, Second Young Master of the Qin family ## Qin Yu Picking Up Someone ## Qin Yu Hug #\u2026The first three phrases were all void of Pei Yunge\u2019s name as if people were afraid of repeating the same mistake. It was enough to see how hard the netizens were trying.However, because the development of reality was way out of their imagination, there were many heated discussions.[Did I just get online? Qin Yu is the Second Young Master of the Qin family? Wuwuwu, you\u2019re indeed a man who will inherit the family fortune without working hard!!][Didn\u2019t they say that all the Qin brothers revolved around Qin Youjiao?? This photo doesn\u2019t look like it\u2026][I don\u2019t know about the rest. I heard that the bear in Brother Yu\u2019s hand was given to Miss Pei and he was even cruelly rejected. Miss Pei is such a ruthless girl, hahaha.][Hahahahahaha, I know how to do this question!! Brother Yu even said that Little Bear will protect his little princess. This is the first time I\u2019ve seen this d*mn man flirting!!][How strange. Am I the only one who has paid attention to Miss Pei\u2019s appearance? F*ck, she can totally debut based on her appearance. Sister is good!!!][Let me put it this way: A while back, Miss Pei was photographed by a certain fandom and was crazily compared to a certain princess. One look and you can tell that she has been framed. Tsk, she\u2019s really the good person here.]\u2026The topic of the Qin siblings was highly discussed. What cracked people up was that the people on the Internet were in a tizzy and didn\u2019t even dare mention the name \u2018Pei Yunge\u2019.However, some of the more aggressive fans started to mock and ridicule her.[Jiaojiao is practicing the piano and Mrs Qin is with her. Don\u2019t bother about Princess Qin. Everyone should pay more attention to artistic work and watch my Jiaojiao\u2019s concert tour.][Some people are really funny. When Jiao\u2019s fans speak, they treat it as slander. If we don\u2019t speak, it means we are not good enough. Disgusted.][Let go of my Jiaojiao. My Jiaojiao doesn\u2019t fight for anything and rely on her ability to attract fans. Don\u2019t spread rumors about the siblings\u2019 relationship. Who doesn\u2019t love Little Fairy Jiaojiao ~][Eh, how doted on can a newcomer be? Besides, if it was me, I\u2019d probably prefer a talented sister like Qin Youjiao\u2026]\u2026In less than half an hour, Qin Youjiao\u2019s fans and \u2018passers-by\u2019 started to gain the upper hand of the discussion and even tried to pull Qin Yu\u2019s fans to a united front.However, Qin Yu\u2019s fans were smart. After all, she was Qin Yu\u2019s younger sister and there was no need for them to get involved in this messy situation.So, gradually\u2026(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)As Pei Yunge did not have any fan groups online, Qin Youjiao\u2019s fans quickly filled the discussion with their comments and mocked and ridiculed Pei Yunge.However, in the end, what was unbelievable was that in less than an hour, all of the meaningful posts about Pei Yunge were deleted in bulk!!!Everyone was shocked.Was Pei Yunge the biological daughter of this social media account??Which artiste or person in the past had the system delete their posts after they were in the headlines?!A few days ago, the social media app had publicly apologized that there was a problem with the system. What about this time???The app deleted posts about Pei Yunge every time there was a problem! Did they treat them as fools??Many people were furious and directly @ the software administrator, hoping to get an explanation.However, in the end, no matter how many messages they left, those administrators acted like they had selective blindness. No one replied!!!\u2026The internet was in an uproar and Pei Yunge was tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep.In the end, Pei Yunge couldn\u2019t help but lift the blanket and went out to pour herself a glass of warm water before returning to her room.After a few minutes, Pei Yunge met the eyes of the teddy bear on the bedside table. \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98: Mr Huo Said You Would Surely Like ItHuo Shidu had not been in this bedroom for too long, so his presence lessened significantly. Pei Yunge also gradually felt that the quality of her sleep was beginning to decline.In fact\u2026In the middle of the night, she was even tempted to believe Qin Yu\u2019s words \u2013 Little bear helps with sleeping.Pei Yunge\u2019s mind gradually turned blank as she stared at the little bear on the bedside table.Should she take it?This stupid bear seemed rather cute.However, within moments, Pei Yunge suddenly realized that she was having some kind of delirious thought.\u201cI\u2019m going crazy.\u201dSome impatience appeared in her bright eyes as she placed the cup on the table.Taking a few steps forward, Pei Yunge lifted the blanket and lay on the bed.Ten minutes later.Under the light gray blanket, a cold and fair wrist reached out and grabbed Little Bear\u2019s little hand with extreme precision before pulling it under the covers.\u2026The next day.Pei Yunge looked pretty energetic. After she was done washing up, she was ready to go downstairs.However, she never thought that Steven would call her at this moment.After Pei Yunge answered the call, she asked, \u201cMr Steven, what\u2019s wrong? Did something happen?\u201d\u201cMiss Pei\u2026 It\u2019s like this. I might not be able to leave Country R for the next few days. Your grandfather\u2019s surgery might be delayed for some time\u2026\u201dWith that said, the person on the other end of the line did not speak and he immediately panicked. \u201cMiss Pei, I\u2019m really sorry. Something happened in our medical institute and we are not banned from leaving.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dPei Yunge asked.Steven took a deep breath and said, \u201cUnreasonable patients always give doctors the biggest headache.\u201dPei Yunge roughly heard Steven explain the reason.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)Actually, the problem just concerned a patient with status and power. This patient was physically weak to begin with, yet this patient refused to listen to the doctor\u2019s strict preoperative prohibitions.In the end, the surgery failed. In a fit of anger, the family deliberately blew up the matter and attracted public attention, causing their medical institute to be suspended from operations.Pei Yunge asked, \u201cCan you solve it?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dSteven chuckled. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time this has happened. However, it\u2019s indeed a little more serious than before.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve dislocated the arm of that family member who was looking for trouble. He\u2019s still lying in the hospital.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNo wonder he was banned from going out.\u201cHowever, Miss Pei, don\u2019t worry. Your grandfather\u2019s physique is much better than others of his age group. I will go to your place as soon as possible and definitely won\u2019t let anything happen to your grandfather.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dPei Yunge answered.After the conversation ended, Pei Yunge hung up the call and was ready to go downstairs for dinner.\u201cMiss Yunge, good morning.\u201d The moment Aunt Miao saw Pei Yunge, her eyes turned excessively gentle.Without sensing the exceptional gaze towards her, Pei Yunge sat down at the dining table. \u201cAunt Miao, is this your new side dish?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s really refreshing. Mr Huo said that you would surely like it and asked me to specially prepare it for you.\u201dAunt Miao exclaimed.\u201cWhere\u2019s Older Brother?\u201dPei Yunge realized that Huo Shidu had not had breakfast with her for the past two days.\u201cHe must be busy with the company. Before you came, Mr Huo rarely ate at home.\u201dAunt Miao scooped a bowl of porridge for Pei Yunge and said to herself.Hearing this, Pei Yunge\u2019s eyes darkened and she did not say anything.\u2026Last night, Pei Yunge received a notice from the school.Today, the top computing institute in the country was going to visit in Hengde High School at noon. They were to pay attention to their dressing.Therefore, the moment Pei Yunge arrived at school, she saw the school leader at the entrance with a bright smile on his facePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99: Having InternsIt was rare to see Cheng Zihuai and Qin Youjiao appear at the door together.The students who entered the school could not help stealing glances at this handsome man and beautiful woman, their expressions filled with envy.This pair of good-looking straight As student couple was the face of the school!Suddenly.A trace of disgust flashed in the dean\u2019s eyes when he noticed Pei Yunge approaching. He then glanced at his watch.\u201cPei Yunge, do you know what time it is now?\u201d\u201cIs your watch broken?\u201dWith that said, Pei Yunge left without a care in the world.Instantly, the dean\u2019s face darkened as a bloody taste surged in his throat!In his teaching career which spanned more than 10 years, he had never met a student as difficult to discipline as Pei Yunge!!!This scene was seen by Cheng Zihuai and Qin Youjiao.Qin Youjiao secretly looked at Cheng Zihuai. Seeing that he was expressionless and his eyes were filled with sarcasm and contempt, she let out a sigh of relief.Then\u2026Cheng Zihuai sneered in disdain. \u201cHow can the Qin family take a liking to such a person? Jiaojiao, she\u2019s not even qualified to be compared with you.\u201dWith that said, Cheng Zihuai did not want to waste time on Pei Yunge. Instead, he returned to his class first, planning to study the computing book that Old Mr Zhong had written.After all, Zhong Shenglin was the only leading figure in the computing field in the country who was as famous as Marcus in R Nation.However, Cheng Zihuai found it hard to believe as well. He did not expect that the always low-key and indifferent A.M. Computing Institute would actually pay a visit to their high school\u2026What a pleasant surprise.\u2026In Class Seven\u2019s classroom.Pei Yunge had just walked in when she realized that there was no one in the class. It seemed like everyone had gathered in the conference room. It was probably for A.M. Computing Institute.She raised her brows. She didn\u2019t think that everyone would be so enthusiastic about A.M. Computing Institute.Then\u2026(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)Just as Pei Yunge put down her bag and was about to leave, her phone rang.It was Marcus.Pei Yunge\u2019s pretty eyes moved as she answered the call.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cGe\u2019er, did Zhong Shenglin, that old man, go to your school?\u201dMarcus was burning with anger. He did not expect this Zhong Shenglin to be so shameless!He could even go to the high school to look for her just to poach his member?!\u201cMaybe. I heard that the A.M. Computing Institute is here.\u201d Pei Yunge thought for a moment.\u201cHe\u2019ll definitely be there! This old man has a way with poaching people! Ge\u2019er, when you see that strange old man later, you must ignore him!\u201dMarcus\u2019 anger could not be suppressed, but in the next second, Pei Yunge heard Marcus say something pitifully.\u201cWe\u2019ve just signed a contract. Ge\u2019er, you should at least finish eating from the bowl first before you look at the pot. Our club is much more generous than the A.M.!\u201dPei Yunge was speechless. \u201c\u2026I don\u2019t plan to enter A.M.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dMarcus let out a long sigh of relief and said, \u201cOh right, Ge\u2019er, we have a habit of having interns around. According to the rules, you can choose two interns to help you.\u201d\u201cInterns?\u201dPei Yunge\u2019s eyebrows moved unconsciously, before her eyes slowly curled up.In her previous life, Pei Yunge also almost got herself an apprentice in school, but this idea was rejected by her mother with a veto. She could only fish in troubled waters in school and do scientific research.However, it was no wonder that Mrs Pei was so cruel.When Pei Yunge was 14 years old, she was already famous for being hard to restrain.She remembered that once, the son of the Director had secretly lifted the bottom of Pei Yunge\u2019s deskmate\u2019s skirt, making the little girl cry from anger.At that time, Pei Yunge smiled and comforted her little deskmate. However, in the middle of the night, when the Director\u2019s son returned from playing games, Pei Yunge hung him on a tree.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100: Are You Being Stubborn Now?After learning of this, Mrs Pei brought Pei Yunge along and wanted to apologize to the Director. After all, it was wrong to hang someone on a tree.However, who knew that once the Director found out that the person who taught his son a lesson was Pei Yunge, he would immediately go home with a dark expression and punish his son.If Pei Yunge injured her head, this little brat could go and see his ancestors too!!However, after this incident, Mrs Pei finally understood that the teachers team in school treated Pei Yunge like a treasure and spoiled her until she was lawless.If he let Pei Yunge hire students, wouldn\u2019t he be allowing her to lead them astray?!\u2026However, clearly, Marcus was very assured of Pei Yunge.In fact, he chuckled. \u201cYes, Ge\u2019er, don\u2019t worry. The interns are the top postgraduate students in R Nation. They definitely won\u2019t cause you any trouble!However\u2026 Ge\u2019er, can I ask you for a favor? \u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dPei Yunge raised an eyebrow.\u201cI have a niece who is also in Yun Cheng, a computing student from Yun Cheng University. Ge\u2019er, if you have time, can you help me mentor her?\u201dMarcus was a little nervous.After all, Pei Yunge had rejected the young master of the Cheng family from Yun Cheng without even looking at him.\u201cYou want me to mentor your niece?\u201d Pei Yunge raised an eyebrow.\u201cThis little ancestor is usually very fierce and always throws a tantrum at me. She refuses to learn from me.\u201dHearing this, Pei Yunge gave a faint smile. \u201cMarcus, do you think I have a good temper?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPutting two barrels of gunpowder together was indeed too dangerous.Suddenly, Marcus thought of a middle-ground and his eyes lit up. \u201cIf she\u2019s willing to learn from you, Ge\u2019er, can you take her?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dPei Yunge said carelessly.She had troubled Marcus so much, so it was okay if she took a student for him.(If you have problems with this website, please continue reading your novel on our new website myboxnovel.com THANKS!)Marcus was relieved to hear this.After hanging up the call, Pei Yunge had just left the classroom when she stopped in her tracks. Lowering her head, she saw a speck of blood on the floor.Her eyes darkened and she slowed down her pace.In the corridor by the stairs, Pei Yunge heard some movement. Her eyes flashed and she approached the source of the sound.\u2026At the end of the corridor.\u201cFatty, you\u2019re still smoking? I really didn\u2019t expect this.\u201dThe boy\u2019s shrill voice was filled with evil intentions.When Pei Yunge looked up, she saw a familiar figure.Chu Zhixing\u2019s face was swollen and bruised. He was holding onto the things in his pocket as he panted heavily, his body covered in cold sweat.\u201cWhat are you protecting? Take it out!\u201dThe boy stepped forward, grabbed Chu Zhixing\u2019s hair and slammed him against the wall ruthlessly. Then he went to snatch the thing in his pocket.However, he realized that it was just a hair tie.However, if one knew about luxury goods, they would find that this hair tie was priced at three to four thousand yuan on the official website.\u201cA hair tie?? Fatty, you can\u2019t be thinking of giving it to some girl, right? With your appearance, which girl will accept your hair tie?\u201dThe boy laughed mockingly and bluntly.These words made Chu Zhixing purse his lips, his voice a little hoarse. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d\u201cOh? Are you being stubborn now? Chu Zhixing, have you forgotten how you got through middle school?\u201dThe boy approached Chu Zhixing and mocked cruelly and deliberately in his ear. \u201cYou\u2019re the dog that I can hit if I want to.\u201dEven if you get into Hengde, I can still make your life miserable! \u201dThese words made Chu Zhixing\u2019s eyes turn red as he remembered how this boy tortured him in middle school.He got him to help deliver his love letters on purpose. Yet, he mocked him publicly along with other girls, saying that he was a fat pig.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
