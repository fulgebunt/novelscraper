So lucky!/This surprise made her suddenly sit up and open her eyes.Beside the bed there were two boys and a girl. The older boy seemed to be around twelve and the other children couldn\u2019t be more than eight or nine years old.The three of them wore old, tattered clothes. The girl\u2019s attire was so old, that the pattern couldn\u2019t be made out.\u201cDid you guys\u2026 \u2026 save me?\u201d Zuo Mei asked. The boys had long hair that was tied into a high bun. She thought this was a secluded place where traditions were still kept and passed down, therefore she wasn\u2019t that surprised.\u201cSister!\u201d She saw the little girl go \u201cWaaa\u201d and cry onto her body. The girl continued in a sobbing tone, \u201cSister, don\u2019t die, don\u2019t die!\u201dSister?Nearly thirty years old, Zou Mei couldn\u2019t help feeling her mood lift up. Internally she thought: this little girl can really flatter! At this age to be actually called 'sister\u201d\u2026Hearing her cry that pitifully, Zou Mei couldn\u2019t help but to reach out and hug her. She gently pat the kid.The little girl\u2019s small body went slightly stiff. And then she hugged Mei stronger and snuggled tighter to her body.\u201cFang Qing, quickly let go of sister. She can\u2019t breathe.\u201dThe bigger of the boys quickly reached out to pull the little girl called Fang Qing away.Excitement could be heard clearly in his voice.Fang Qing, being pulled away, let out a sob like a discontent kitten, but no longer stuck to ZouMei and obediently stood aside. She sniffed and looked at Zou Mei with her watery, beautiful eyes that were filled with attachment.Zou Mei let out a big sigh and smiled gratefully at the bigger boy thinking: the biggest one is very mature!\u201cWhere is this? You\u2026 What are you guys called?\u201d Zou Mei smiled as she asked the older boy.Hearing this, his eyes suddenly opened wide, looking at Zou Mei in shock. The four words, \u2018how is this possible\u2019 were written on his face.Zou Mei\u2019s smile turned slightly stiff on her face. She couldn\u2019t help the feeling that something was weird.\u201cSISTER!\u201d She didn\u2019t get a chance to ask, as the little girl let out an earthshaking, mournful cry startling her.\u201cSister! You can\u2019t recognize us? You don\u2019t want us? Waa\u2026waa\u2026\u2026\u201d the little girl clung to her body again and burst into tears.\u201cDon\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry! Sister wouldn\u2019t abandon us, definitely wouldn\u2019t!\u201d the little boy sniffed. He looked like he was about to cry, but bit his lips to stifle it. He glanced at Zou Mei like he was wronged and tugged at Fang Qing\u2019s sleeve.That appearance was extremely cute! He looked like he couldn\u2019t bear to look at Zou Mei, as if she did something heartless.\u201cSister,\u201d when the bigger boy regained his composure, he pulled the little girl away and let the little boy comfort his baby sister. He looked at Zou Mei with sadness in his eyes. \u201cSister, don\u2019t be like this. If that Yang family wants to break off the engagement, then let them! They just bully us since we got no dad or mum. Not marrying into that kind of family is good! Sister, I will take care of you, so don\u2019t be depressed.

The older brother seeing this, rushed to help.Zou Mei suddenly left the bed. The basin was placed on a broken old square table. She stuck out her head and took a look. The reflection shown her a pale oval face, very big eyes and dark red lips.These delicate facial features were definitely not her near thirty year old face. Those small arms, thin legs and petite physique definitely belonged to a malnourished fourteen-fifteen year old girl.Combined with the fact that a moment ago those siblings called her \u2018sister\u2019\u2026 Zou Mei\u2019s body.\u201cSister!\u201d the bigger boy rushed to support her: \u201cAre you alright? Do you want to sit down for a while?\u201d\u201cI\u2014\u2013\u201d Zou Mei opened and closed her mouth, she realised she didn\u2019t know what to say.She allowed the bigger boy to help her sit down. She glanced around what could be called the four walls of home. A pang of dismay flashed in her heart.Sighing secretly, although her heart was a chaotic mess, she had to admit that she was forced to accept this reality\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Zou Mei smiled reluctantly and said softly: \u201cI will not die, from now on, we are a family\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSister it\u2019s great that you thought it through!\u201d The bigger boy noded vigorously. He seemed a little bit excited. His mouth curved into a smile showing his white teeth.Zou Mei felt that his thick brows and big eyes made him look really good when he laughed.\u201cSister ! Sister !\u201d Fang Qing rushed up to embrace her. Holding her as she sobbed like a spoiled child: \u201cSister will not die. Sister spoils me the most. I don\u2019t want sister to die\u2026\u201dZou Mei smiled, and could not help but to hug her back strongly.At the moment she could only take one step at a time. These three siblings weren\u2019t that old. Judging by their words and expressions, they were attached to this sister. Getting information from their mouths shouldn\u2019t be hard and no flaw should be revealed in her act\u2014- at such a young age, would they understand reincarnation?Anyway\u2014There was no pain nor sickness. No trace of scars on her neck. The body had no wounds and looked okay. Why did these little guys cry and clamour for her not to die?\u201cJust now, I \u2014what happened?\u201d Zou Mei asked with a smile.\u201cHua family\u2019s fat woman came to our house again and yelled in our courtyard. Sister you listened, and in a moment collapsed onto the ground not breathing\u201d Fang Qing explained quickly.\u201cThe Hua family?\u201d Zou Mei questioned slightly startled.\u201cFang Qing!\u201d the bigger boy quietly reproached and faced the puzzled Zou Mei. \u201cSister don\u2019t you remember the Hua family?\u201dZou Mei rubbed her temples smiling ruefully: \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but since I woke up my mind is a bit hazy. There\u2019s lots of things I can\u2019t remember clearly .The bigger boy, as if suddenly realising something, nodded without suspicions and did not inquire any further. He then said: \u201cHalf a year ago our parents passed away in a flash flood in the mountains. Sister\u2019s fiance\u2019s family, the Yangs, wanted to break off the engagement ever since. But sister\u2014\u201dThe boy shot a troubled glance at Zou Mei.Obviously the former Zou Mei was opposed to that development.This couldn\u2019t be blamed on her, family in poverty, no dad or mum, left with three underage siblings, once this engagement was broken, which family would be willing to marry her?She smiled understanding and nodded, then asked: \u201cWhat happened then?\u201dThe bigger boy, seeing her let go of this issue, felt his spirits lift, and hurriedly continued: \u201cThe Yang family couldn\u2019t break off the engagement, but at that time the Hua family\u2019s daughter caught their eye. So they told the Hua family\u2019s people that they have no idea how to make sister break off the engagement. The Hua old woman let her eldest daughter-in-law, Mrs Liu run to our house and heckle / holler. A moment ago, sister was angered by Mrs Liu greatly and fainted.Fortunately sister is all right. Otherwise I would feud with Mrs Liu forever!So it was like that!Zou Mei secretly sighed in her heart, your sister wasn\u2019t angered to the point of fainting but actually died from fury!That girl\u2019s temperament was too volatile.Suddenly a sharp voice came from outside the door, Zou Mei couldn\u2019t help but listen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He suddenly turned around saying: \u201cI\u2019ll go get rid of this woman!\u201d\u201cWait!\u201d Zou Mei held him back and continued to listen.The more she listened; the more her brows wrinkled up.No wonder that girl died of rage. Those words that Mrs. Liu said were really ugly to listen too. Words dripping with venom, mean, vicious, a whole devilish rant.Facing this not just that girl, but even Zou Mei listening for a while couldn\u2019t help feeling a surge of anger and became fed up.She suddenly got up, picked the basin from the table and quickly rushed out with a \u201cCrash!\u201d to drench Mrs. Liu with its contents.The woman had her hands on her hips and facing the Lian family home was yelling loudly scattering spit everywhere. Suddenly a basin worth of cold water fell on her out of the blue startling her to a scream \u201cAAAAHH\u201d. That, in turn, made all the water get into her eyes, mouth and nose resulting in lots of squinting and choking.This was also weather at the end of September, chilly, making it very easy to catch a cold.\u201cWho, who, is that wicked\u2014-achoo! Achoo!\u201d Mrs. Liu was shocked as well as angry. She wiped the remainder of the water from her face.\u201cYour family\u2019s aunt!\u201d Zou Mei placed the basin on the ground. She pointed at Mrs. Liu and yelled: \u201c Dead bitch, you dare run wild at my threshold. Next time it won\u2019t be cold water but manure! And even that won\u2019t stink as much as your mouth does!\u201d\u201cYou, you, you\u2014\u201d Mrs. Liu was so surprised that her eyes opened wide. Not daring to believe the existence of the arrogant little girl in front of her.Was this the timid eldest daughter of the Lian family? Could it be that her eyes had seen wrongly?A round of cheering arrived from the distant group of watching villagers, that naturally gathered to spectate the exciting confrontation. Laughter and several words of ridicule were directed at Mrs. Liu who found herself in a difficult situation. Some people though were whispering while stealing glances at Zou Mei.Clearly, they, like Mrs. Liu were also shocked.This Lian girl, today her temperament changed completely!However, even a clay figurine is also three parts soil! If one wanted to assign blame, then it would be on Mrs. Liu\u2019s mouth for being too wicked\u2026\u201cYou dare drench me!\u201d Regaining her wits the woman screamed and charged Zou Mei.But she was already prepared and sidestepped smiling coldly.Who would have thought that at the same time the big brother, fearing his sister would be at a disadvantage, collared the younger two to pick wooden sticks and holding a broom rushed out of the house. Yelling \u201cDo not bully my sister!\u201d they rushed at Mrs. Liu together.Mrs. Liu, in shock, subconsciously took a step back. Caught off guard she slipped and with an \u201cOuch\u201d fell heavily into the puddle made of water which was just used to splash her. Her whole body got covered in mud.\u201cBwahaha,\u201d That embarrassing appearance set the people off into laughter again.Zou Mei and the siblings couldn\u2019t help but start laughing as well. Particularly Fang Qing, who laughed with the most joy. Her laugh was like a tinkling clear sound.Mrs. Liu felt shamed and angry. Her flat like a pancake face turned purple. When she was about to get up, she saw Zou Mei standing in front of her. The girl, voice cold and full of condescension, said : \u201cStop dirtying my doorstep and bug off! Breaking the engagement is no big deal, right? Just bring money! Now scram!\u201dMrs. Liu\u2019s face went through various shades of red then back to purple. She choked and choked, and while she really wanted to be like her usual self, hurling vicious, ferocious words at that damn Lian Fang Zhou, her tongue was numb. She couldn\u2019t even spit out a single abusive word.Eventually, after much difficulty, she picked herself up and threw out a \u201cYou just wait!\u201d and ran away.Lian Fang Zhou faced the excited onlookers and bowed to everyone present: \u201cAll the uncles, aunties, brothers and sisters, that Mrs. Liu was a beastly bully. Us siblings had no other way than to fight back. If the Hua family comes to look for trouble, please help by being a witness.\u201dAll the people nodded. Everyone agreed and many said the siblings didn\u2019t have it easy.\u201cFang Zhou, don\u2019t worry! Bullying a few parentless orphans, justice won\u2019t allow it! If that kind of rumor spreads out, our Dafang village\u2019s reputation will be ruined! If they dare come and make trouble again, everyone will definitely help speak up for you!\u201dSaid a middle-aged woman wearing somewhat old dark red dress stepping out. Other people chimed in and said that she was right. Hearing that the lady dismissed the gathered crowd saying \u201cIt\u2019s alright now, it\u2019s alright. Everyone go busy yourself!\u201d\u201cAunt Zhang, thank you!\u201d Lian Ze bowed deeply towards the woman.\u201cAah, this child, why so polite!\u201d she quickly stopped him from bowing and exclaimed:\u201dAlright, you guys quickly go back! Do what you\u2019re supposed to do, if you need any help, just come to our house and say so. Do not need to hesitate!\u201d\u201cAunt Zhang, you have already helped us out so much. In the future, we will definitely repay you and uncle Li.\u201d Lian Ze said gratefully.Aunt Zhang sighed. She said softly: \u201cSilly child, saying silly things! When your parents were alive, didn\u2019t they also help us many times? We\u2019re all one village, no need to see yourself as an outsider!As she talked, she turned to Zou Mei\u2014 who is supposed to be called Lian Fang Zhou. Embracing Fang Zhou\u2019s hands, she continued: \u201cGood girl, don\u2019t be depressed! No matter what the days are like, carry on living! You are the eldest, so let\u2019s not talk about others, just for your few siblings, you have to be strong!\u201dLian Fang Zhou\u2019s heart warmed, she nodded her head and smiled as she said: \u201cAunt Zhang, thank you. I will. From now on, who would dare to even think about bullying us siblings!\u201dAunt Zhang thinking of Fang Zhou\u2019s previous tough behavior, smiled and said: \u201cIt\u2019s great that you thought it through!\u201d but she couldn\u2019t help to ask : \u201cYou really \u2014 promised to break off the engagement?\u201d\u201cAunt Zhang.\u201d Lian Fang Zhou laughed and said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t the question of whether I am willing or not. The other party already forced their way to the door. Why should I suffer from their pestering?\u201dLian Fang Zhou, heart full of gloom, thought: Marriage? She\u2019s too lazy to want this bothersome marriage! If she can break it off, then she\u2019s lucky! If she can\u2019t then that would be bad!\u201cWell said!\u201d Aunt Zhang couldn\u2019t help but give her a thumbs up: \u201cHave ambition! At last, you can think it through! Your parents in heaven can rest in peace!\u201dWith their parents mentioned, the siblings\u2019 looks darkened.Aunt Zhang very softly said: \u201cDon\u2019t be sad, sooner or later you will have to face it! It is the truth! For us poor people, the most important thing is to realize the truth. Endure a bit and it will pass! Alright, this auntie should return now. The day isn\u2019t young, I need to hurry home and make dinner. I told Ah Juan to pick lots of beans, and winter melon. In a while, come to my home and get some.\u201dLian Fang Zhou and Lian Fang Ze hastily gave their thanks.Seeing Aunt Zhang go, the siblings also returned home.Their house had three rooms. There was the main room and two bedrooms. Upstairs attic, that was used for food storage. The kitchen was located outside, under eaves in a corner.The exterior of the building was perhaps the original stone structure, but due to long years, half of the roof tiles had been replaced with thick bark-based thatch.While the interior, besides a few pieces of old, rough, wooden furniture and partially missing tea set, was devoid of anything substantial.It seemed like that Lian Fang Zhou wasn\u2019t a hard working person. With Lian Ze being a boy and Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che very young, the interior was dirty and messy, really chaotic in appearance.\u201cSister, you rest a moment. I\u2019ll go cook the rice and after a while, I\u2019ll pick some vegetables from the garden. Ah Che, you watch the fire. Fang Qing go check if the two old hens returned yet. Spread some feed and quickly lock up the chicken cage \u2014but be prudent, don\u2019t use too much.Lian Ze commanded skillfully and the little guys immediately agreed.Lian Fang Zhou softly rubbed her forehead: Isn\u2019t she the eldest sister? Shouldn\u2019t she give out the orders? And\u2014\u201cWhat about me? What should I do?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t help asking.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So did Lian Che and Lian Fang Qing.Lian Fang Zhou felt ashamed: so she was always a freeloader\u2026.This Lian Fang Zhou was too unreasonable. For that unwanted betrothal, making her wallow in self-pity until she turned into this?\u201cHow about this, I\u2019ll go to pick the vegetables! Qing\u2019er, you\u2019ll accompany sister, is that okay?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou felt uncomfortable under the gaze of three pairs of eyes.\u201cOkay, okay! I\u2019ll go accompany sister!\u201d Lian Fang Qing crisply agreed, beautiful eyes laughing til her eyebrow curved.Lian Che quickly said : \u201cBrother, I\u2019ll look for the hens now.\u201dLian Ze still a little bit shocked, replied \u201cAlright\u201d in a daze while watching the two sisters carry the vegetable basket out.\u201cBrother, don\u2019t you feel that our sister is not the same?\u201d Lian Che raised his small little head towards his older brother\u201cEn.\u201d Lian Ze nodded his head. He rubbed his head and smiling asked: \u201cDon\u2019t you think sister is great now?\u201dLian Che thought about it, and nodded his head: \u201cGreat!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good!\u201d Lian Ze laughed.Lian\u2019s vegetable patch was not far away from the house\u2019s east wall. Six, maybe seven rows of vegetables. It was not pretty to look at.It was the end of September, the time of the year when vegetables were the most scarce.Reaching this season, the ground really lacked in a potential harvest. Beans, chili peppers, and cucumbers were all coming to the end of their life. All the vines and stems were half dry and yellowish with scarce patches of green. An occasional leaf and puny shriveled fruit, really nothing to collect.Under all that, a barely visible half a plot of red, sweet potato, but with leaves of unhealthy green color.This made the agricultural graduate Zou Mei lament in her heart.However, Lian Fang Qing was very calm and said: \u201cSister, we\u2019ll dig out some sweet potatoes! This morning second brother said that tonight we\u2019ll eat sweet potato porridge!\u201dIn this whole garden only this looked edible. Lian Fang Zhou sighed and nodded: \u201cAlright!\u201dThese sweet potatoes had really small tubers. Even with one glance, Lian Fang Zhou could tell this was the result of growing the plant from a whole sweet potato, unlike the modern method of using a stem or root cutting.This way of cultivation not only wasted the seeds but also offered low yields. Yet at the same time, she didn\u2019t know if other people knew the method of using cuttings\u2026\u2026.She thought to herself while digging.The two sisters harvested five, then six tubers. Lian Fang Zhou also picked a handful of shriveled beans and some small chili peppers. Then they went back.The bean vines were dead and could only be pulled out. As for the chili peppers, if the soil around them was loosened and fertilized, they might possibly revive, become green, bloom and bear fruit again.She planned to come here tomorrow to tidy up a bit.Like Aunt Zhang said, this life, she still had to carry on living it!Wasn\u2019t that right! Now that she was at this place, she could only look forward to the days ahead.On the way back, Lian Fang Zhou casually asked Lian Fang Qing about the condition of their field.Lian Fang Qing was still young. Some parts of her answer were clear and some not so much. Lian Fang Zhou could only abandon the inquiries. Better to carefully ask Lian Ze. That child matured early and had to know more.\u201cLian Fang Zhou, Qing\u2019er, you came back! Mum told me to send down two bags of beans and a winter melon. I handed it over to Lian Ze!\u201dThe two just reached the yard\u2019s entrance and saw a round-faced girl of a similar age coming out from the house.Lian Fang Zhou smiled as she gave her thanks while Lian Fang Qing cried out with twinkling laughter: \u201cSister Juan!\u201dLian Fang Zhou then understood this was Aunt Zhang\u2019s daughter, Li Juan.\u201cAuntie is really generous!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled.\u201cSay nothing of the kind. Our two families have always been close to each other, I will go back now!\u201d Li Juan smiled as she departed.\u201cAh, you can go slowly!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled watching her leave and then she with her sister went inside.The porridge was nearly done cooking, with a faint aroma coming out from the dark metal pan. Even with a wooden lid on, the smell could be felt. Lian Fang Zhou was really a bit hungry.The siblings washed the sweet potatoes clean, cut them into pieces and put them in the pan.Lian Ze then went to chop some firewood. Lian Che watched the fire. Lian Fang Qing was luring the two hens, who were going in circles clucking around the yard, back into the chicken coop.Lian Fang Zhou looked around, picked up a broom and then started cleaning up the room.\u201cWhat did you come for? Our home doesn\u2019t welcome you, get out!\u201dLian Ze\u2019s voice suddenly boomed in the yard, the tone was cold and filled with hostility.Lian Fang Zhou froze as she also heard Lian Fang Qing yell childishly: \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to bully my sister!\u201dShe quickly tossed the broom aside and went out asking: \u201cAh Ze, Qing\u2019er, who came?\u201d\u201cSister!\u201d Lian Ze was starting to panic. He wanted to stop her seeing the visitor. But his efforts weren\u2019t enough.As she came over, a young man in a somewhat old, bamboo green robe yelled her name looking both surprised and happy.\u201cWhat are you doing! Did you not hear me tell you to get out?\u201d Lian Ze was really anxious. He ran to block him while staring coldly.\u201cAh Ze!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou frowned slightly, she couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on.\u201cSister. Why do you still wish to see him? The Yang family doesn\u2019t have a single good member, why do you still see him? Did you forget what you said just today?\u201d Lian Ze was anxious as well as annoyed. With a dash of distressed anger on top.\u201cFang Zhou no need to worry. Breaking the engagement is my parent\u2019s idea. I wouldn\u2019t agree! I just got back from helping at the horse races and heard about it. I came specifically to tell you, I will definitely marry you!\u201dThe young man solemnly said as he looked at Lian Fang Zhou.Lian Fang Zhou was stunned. This was the deity-like fiance, Yang Huai Shan? His looks were quite pleasing to the eye, with a darker than normal skin and rather nice face. He looked to be of fine spirit and quiet temperamentAnd he treated her not too bad. No wonder the previous Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t want to let go of this engagement.A pity she wasn\u2019t the previous Lian Fang Zhou and this marriage wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201cNo need!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s with a serious face said indifferently: \u201c Marriage matters are decided by parents. Yours have already matched you with another\u2026 You better obey their will!\u201d\u201cFang Zhou, I\u2014-\u201d\u201cLet me finish speaking!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou continued quietly: \u201cNow my parents are both dead. Before my siblings grow up, I will definitely not marry. Since your parents don\u2019t like me, I don\u2019t want to marry into your home and face their scorn all day. So better to forget about this betrothal. However, it\u2019s good that you came today! I\u2019ll tell you this; dissolution of the engagement was initiated by your family. So if you want the marriage contract, bring ten liang in exchange\u2014 I hope my conditions aren\u2019t over the top?Yang Huai Shan was completely lost and shocked, he looked at Lian Fang Zhou as if she was a stranger.Lian Ze also froze. It looked like he wanted to say something and moved his lips, but he said nothing. He just stood closer to Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s side and silently supported his sister.\u201cHaha\u201d Yang Huai Shan face paled and he said self-deprecatingly \u201cTen liang? Is that all? Why don\u2019t you ask for more? So in your heart, our engagement is worth only that much money?\u201dLian Fang Zhou looked at him and calmly said: \u201cI actually want more! I\u2019m just afraid your parents would say I have a lion\u2019s big mouth and wouldn\u2019t give anything in anger. That\u2019s not worth it!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Yang Huai Shan was so angry that he couldn\u2019t say anything. His heart hurt with disappointment.He couldn\u2019t believe it. He looked at her with hope and said: \u201cFang Zhou, this isn\u2019t what you really think. These are words said in anger, right? Or are you in a bind? Don\u2019t worry, I will come back. My business I can decide for myself. I will talk with my parents!\u201dLian Fang Zhou sighed in her heart. Shaking her head and meeting his gaze, she said: \u201cDon\u2019t work yourself up, trying to find emotions that are not there! I can swear that these words come from my heart, so not another word. The day isn\u2019t young anymore, so you need to leave quickly. After all, hosting an adult man at this time in one\u2019s home isn\u2019t proper! Listen to your parents and carry on living well. And don\u2019t forget to bring the money to exchange for the marriage contract!\u201dYang Huai Shan\u2018s arms which he held by his sides began to tremble uncontrollably. His heart was extremely sad and extremely angry. For a while, he couldn\u2019t say anything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Another unexpected guestTranslated by Maggie Edited by Pete Proofread by SimpleLian Ze raised his chin and harrumphed: \u201cMy sister already said it very clearly. Why aren\u2019t you leaving? Your parents have hoped for this day for so long. Quickly, scram!\u201dLian Fang Qing also ran up, held her sister\u2019s hand and said to Yang Huai Shan: \u201cBad person, villain! Not allowed to bully my sister!\u201dLian Fang Zhou rubbed her head and thought that this young girl in the past, must have bore a lot of her ex-future parent-in-law\u2019s anger.\u201cAs you wish!\u201d Yang Huai Shan smiled coldly: \u201cFrom now on, you and I have no ties!\u201dHe finished speaking while grinding his teeth. Then, without turning his head back, he left.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go back and start dinner!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou sighed in relief.\u201cI\u2019ll get the bowls!\u201d Lian Fang Qing cheered loudly.\u201cI\u2019ll get the stools!\u201d Lian Che followed her.These two little guys are really mature!Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s heart warmed; and without knowing it, she smiled softly.She believed that, with her mastery of modern agriculture and the sibling\u2019s unity, in the future, their days would get better and better.Difficulties would be only temporary.\u201cSister, are you really alright?\u201d Lian Ze looked at her. The worry on his frowning brow didn\u2019t match his age.\u201cDo I look like I am not?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled and replied softly: \u201cDon\u2019t think too much!\u201dLian Ze finally cheered up and said: \u201cIt\u2019s great that sister is fine. In the future, sister will definitely find someone a thousand times better than the Yang family\u2019s son.\u201d\u201cPuh\u2026 Haha\u201d Lian Fang Zhou burst out in loud laughter. Smiling, she said: \u201cLeave future matters to be discussed in the future, come, it\u2019s dinner time!\u201d\u201cAh,\u201d Lian Ze\u2019s forehead smoothed, his mood finally really relaxed. Then he suddenly frowned a bit and asked: \u201cBreaking off the engagement is fine, but sister, why do you want their money?\u201dHis words and attitude suggested he didn\u2019t agree with that.Lian Fang Zhou then asked him: \u201cHow much money does our family still have?\u201dLian Ze froze; suddenly feeling somewhat ashamed, he said quietly: \u201cLess than eight hundred wen\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you see!\u201d Lian Fang Zhu patted his shoulder. In a matter-of-fact tone, she said, \u201cSister knows that you are an upright person, but don\u2019t be too pedantic. This matter was originally their family wronging our family, letting them cough out some blood is natural! And it is nearly winter, we need this money to survive through it, right? Don\u2019t Qing\u2019er and Che\u2019er need to have some winter clothes sewn? Doesn\u2019t this house need repairs, especially the roof and the windows? How else will we last through winter?\u201dLian Ze was speechless, although, inwardly he admitted that Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s way was correct, his heart still couldn\u2019t agree.Lian Fang Zhou could see that, but didn\u2019t say it out loud. She could only think to herself: \u201cThis brat! In the future, I\u2019ll have to definitely change his way of thinking\u2026\u201dThe siblings finished dinner, cleaned up and quickly went to bed.The house was narrow. Originally their parents lived in one room, Lian Ze slept on a loft bed on the ground floor, and the other room was partitioned for the three siblings to live in.Now that mom and dad weren\u2019t here, the brothers moved to that room.Lian Fang Qing was always sleeping in one bed with her sister. Once she entered the room, she took off her shoes, crawled up the bed, lifted the patched, worn out quilt and drill into it. She called out to Lian Fang Zhou: \u201cSister, quickly, let\u2019s go to sleep!\u201dActually, Lian Fang Zhou wasn\u2019t used to sleeping with someone else, but when called by Lian Fang Qing\u2019s charming, soft voice, she did not hesitate anymore. She smiled and promised that she would come soon.Suddenly, she stopped her footsteps with a quiet \u201cAh!\u201d She started to search every corner of the room.Lian Fang Qing blinked for a moment in confusion. She rolled over to raise her head, and asked: \u201cSister, what are you looking for?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking for the marriage certificate, I don\u2019t remember where it was placed!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou answered in a straightforward manner, without a hint of depression.If the Yang family came tomorrow and she couldn\u2019t bring out the marriage certificate, then that wouldn\u2019t be good, would it?\u201cMarriage certificate?\u201d Lian Fang Qing froze. She patted the pillow beside her and looking puzzled, asked: \u201cSister, wasn\u2019t it sewn into the pillow? You told me not to tell anyone; I didn\u2019t even tell second brother and third brother!\u201dShe watched Lian Fang Zhou, her face saying, \u201cCompliment me! I\u2019m a good girl!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! See what kind of memory sister has, Qing\u2019er is the best!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou did as her little sister wished. Her heart was simply elated.Lian Fang Qing raised her chin proudly and giggled quietly with curved eyebrows.A night with no words.The next day Lian Fang Zhou got up early. She tidied up the house, inside and outside. Everything was cleaned, wiped, and sorted out. She brought out all of their bedding to air in the sun.Lian Che and Lian Qing helped; while Lian Ze was sent to make breakfast.After tidying up properly, their little group looked at the newly shining house and unknowingly felt happier in their hearts.After breakfast, Lian Ze said: \u201cSister, you, Qing\u2019er and Che\u2019er stay at home. I\u2019ll go to the Sixth Water field and collect our taro!\u201dLian Fang Zhou thought about it and said: \u201cToday we\u2019ll tidy up our vegetable plot, tomorrow I\u2019ll go with you to the collect taro!\u201d Just perfect; now she would get to know about the family\u2019s land.Lian Ze didn\u2019t decline and promised to do so.Leaving the two children to watch the house, the siblings took the hoes and went to the garden.Lian Fang Zhou led Lian Ze to those dying beans and cucumbers. They pulled them out completely and piled the plants in one corner.Then she told Lian Ze to go and dilute the manure with some water, using a small hoe. While they used the mixture to loosen the soil, she said:\u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll dig up the vegetables first and sort them. At this section, we can plant some carrots and sprinkle some rapeseed around!\u201dLian Ze hearing her plans, without any particular reason, felt peace of mind. He nodded and said smiling: \u201cI will obey sister. What sister tells us to do, we will do!\u201dThe two siblings smiled at each other.Busy until the afternoon, the two of them became tired and out of breath.Lian Fang Zhou ended up like this; probably because she hadn\u2019t worked for a long time now. While Lian Ze got tired, since after all, he was still a child!Lian Fang Zhou looked at him and suddenly felt a little pain in her heart; so she said: \u201cThe time isn\u2019t early. Let\u2019s return, have lunch and rest a bit. This work won\u2019t be finished in an hour and a half.\u201dLian Ze originally didn\u2019t want to return, but he saw the insistence on her face. He knew that if he didn\u2019t return, she would also not go; so he nodded his head with an \u201calright.\u201d The two siblings returned together.Last night was sweet potato porridge. This morning was also the same porridge. Lian Fang Zhou lost her appetite.Her brows frowned slightly, but when she wanted to ask how much grain does the house have since harvest was not long ago, she heard the door creak as someone pushed it open.The siblings were startled!Lian Fang Zhou opened her mouth to ask the visitor, why did she come; but before she could say anything, in a flash the brown clothed silhouette rushed into her room like a gust of wind.Lian Fang Zhou was stunned!\u201cAunt, what are you doing?!\u201d The first to recover her senses was Lian Fang Qing.The wife of father\u2019s elder brother? Judging by this behavior, this was definitely a shameless relative!Lian Ze rushed to follow the aunt into the room. Lian Fang Zhou heard him ask: \u201cAunt, what are you doing?!\u201d\u201cSister,\u201d said Lian Fang Qing to Lian Fang Zhou quietly: \u201cAunt definitely came for the marriage contract again!\u201dAgain\u2026\u2026Lian Fang Zhou flashed a faint, cold smile and told the twins softly: \u201cYou two be good and eat.\u201d Then she entered the room her aunt went into.Lian Fang Qing wanted to follow, but was held back by Lian Che: \u201cListen to sister. Don\u2019t go.\u201dLian Fang Qing not being able to do anything about it, pouted unhappily, but still obediently sat down.In the other room, Lian Fang Zhou watched her aunt screech menacingly and demand: \u201cThe marriage contract? Where is it!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Breaking off the engagementTranslated by Maggie Edited by Pete Proofread by SimpleLian Ze was furious; his face was like heavy clouds before the arrival of the storm.Without waiting for her brother to burst into rage, Lian Fang Zhou smiled and said leisurely: \u201cAunt, isn\u2019t your marriage certificate at your own home? How come you have gone to search for it here? Seeing you this anxious to find it, do you want to remarry?\u201dMrs. Qiao and Lian Ze both froze. Before long Lian Ze couldn\u2019t stop himself from laughing, but he tried to bite his lip, lower his head and mask it with a cough. Mrs. Qiao was embarrassed so much that anger showed on her face. She noisily spat on the ground.( TN : this gesture it usually appears when someone says something unlucky. Kinda like trying to prevent a jinx. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some Chinese drama that has a dude saying \u201cyou won\u2019t be able to marry\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019ll get ill\u201d and another dude will go pah pah pah as if to dismiss the jinx/rejecting that thought ).Then she said with a cold smile: \u201cNo wonder these days there\u2019s an uproar saying you changed into a different person. Sure enough, it\u2019s true. What rubbish are you spouting from your mouth! Is that how you speak to your elder?! Are you not afraid of hurting your tongue?\u201d\u201cElder?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled coldly and said: \u201cI nearly thought you came here to rob us! So you\u2019re actually an elder! I\u2019m not afraid of hurting my tongue, but I worry you might sprain your waist!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Mrs. Qiao had never suffered such a rebuke before and for a while, she couldn\u2019t say anything. After a moment she harrumphed: \u201cStop feigning ignorance in front of me; where\u2019s your marriage certificate with the Yang family? Quickly bring it out!\u201dLian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t help becoming angry: \u201cWhy should I?!\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Mrs. Qiao placed her hands on her waist, stepped closer and said fiercely: \u201cBecause I am your Aunt! Your Uncle and I are your elders! Of course, these important things should be given to us for care taking!\u201d\u201cNo need!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled coldly and said: \u201cMy parents are gone, so now in this family, I am the elder! Our family\u2019s matters don\u2019t need you managing them!\u201d\u201cOutrageous! What are you saying?!\u201d Mrs. Qiao was angered till her bursting point.\u201cAunt please return! What my sister said is right. Now she is our family head. Our business doesn\u2019t need aunt worrying about it!\u201d Lian Ze also said indifferently.Mrs. Qiao couldn\u2019t find the thing, trying to snatch it also failed and her was heart was burning with rage. Just when she was thinking of what to say next, she heard an old woman yelling outside: \u201cIs anyone here? Lian Fang Zhou? Lian Fang Zhou get out! We, the Yang family have come to break off the engagement!\u201dLian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze subconsciously exchanged looks. No wonder Mrs. Qiao came to look for the marriage certificate! She was actually aiming for the ten liang of silver!Lian Fang Zhou lightly harrumphed, then raised her voice and saying: \u201cComing\u201d and left the room.Lian Ze also looked at Mrs. Qiao once and followed his sister.Lian Fang Zhou saw a tall and thin person who was the neat and smart old woman Yang. She said in an indifferent tone: \u201cDid you bring the money?\u201dOld woman Yang looked at her with contempt. From her inside pocket, she took out the money and shook it: \u201cTen liang, not one less! However, I want to see the marriage certificate!\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled frankly and said: \u201cOne hand giving the money while the other gives the goods is the fairest!\u201dOld woman Yang harrumphed and didn\u2019t answer in disdainLian Fang Zhou turned her head and looked at the Mrs. Qiao who came out of the room: \u201cAunt, now that there\u2019s no matter for you to take care of here, please return to your home!\u201d\u201cWait!\u201d old woman Yang suddenly said: \u201cYour aunt must stay and be the witness, so people won\u2019t say that we, the Yang family are bullying you parent-less kids!\u201d Hearing words like that isn\u2019t good for anyone.Lian Ze\u2019s face changed and he coldly shot a glance at her.At the same time, Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t help but be furious. This old woman\u2019s mouth was as stinky as that Hua family\u2019s woman. No wonder they wanted to be in-laws.\u201cDid you hear that? For now, I still won\u2019t go!\u201d Mrs. Qiao said triumphantly. With that, she pulled out a stool and sat on it in an exaggerated manner. She kept glancing from Lian Fang Zhou to the money in old woman Yang\u2019s hand. She really wanted to snatch it now.Lian Fang Zhou weighed things out in her head. She couldn\u2019t vouch that after she brought the marriage certificate out, Mrs. Qiao wouldn\u2019t snatch the money.On the other hand, this old woman Yang was definitely harboring hatred in her heart towards the former Lian Fang Zhou; for not wanting to break off the engagement. It was uncertain what hidden bad intentions she has. If she did something malicious at this moment, then the money would fall into Mrs. Qiao\u2019s hand. Later, when she wanted to cry, she would have no one to cry to.\u201cWitness? Oh, that\u2019s right! If there\u2019s a witness, then people won\u2019t say that us siblings are playing tricks!\u201dLian Fang Zhou laughed and then continued: \u201cHowever, it isn\u2019t appropriate for Aunt to be the witness. She is part of Lian family. To avoid suspicion, Ah Ze go and invite Aunt Zhang over. Letting Aunt Zhang be the witness is very appropriate!\u201dLian Ze looked at Mrs. Qiao once, nodded his head and immediately left.Mrs. Qiao was stunned. But she couldn\u2019t even say a single word to refute the idea.Old woman Yang staring coldly couldn\u2019t help but sneer secretly: Sure enough, she\u2019s not only poor, she\u2019s also a sly girl! At that time, the old man was really blind to arrange this marriage!Not long after, Aunt Zhang came. Seeing the situation, she sighed secretly. Mrs. Qiao shot her a hostile look, but Aunt Zhang pretended she didn\u2019t see it.Lian Fang Zhou smiled and entered the bedroom to get the marriage certificate.Mrs. Qiao immediately stood up to follow, however, Lian Ze abruptly stood in front of her: \u201cAunt, since you want to be a witness, it\u2019s better to wait outside!\u201dLian Fang Zhou very quickly brought out the marriage contract.Seeing that Mrs. Qiao\u2019s eyes lit up, quietly gaining momentum she fiercely rushed toward Lian Fang Zhou, wanting to snatch the marriage certificate in her hand. But Lian Fang Zhou was already prepared, so she dodged to avoid her. Mrs. Qiao nearly tumbled to the ground.\u201cBring it to me, so I can see if it\u2019s real!\u201d Mrs. Qiao was inwardly furious, she could only reach out her hand with a sullen face.Lian Fang Zhou just sneered and coldly said: \u201cWhat does it have to do with you? It\u2019s not like Mrs. Yang is breaking off the engagement with your household.\u201dAunt Qiao saw Lian Fang Zhou walk toward old woman Yang. Once these two exchanged the money for the certificate, it would have nothing to do with her anymore. Such an easy ten liang and she would get no share.Mrs. Qiao couldn\u2019t help but be anxious. She yelled in a stern tone: \u201cLIAN FANG ZHOU! You dead bitch! What kind of mess do want to create? You\u2019re a girl, do you have any shame? To actually break off an engagement! You may not want any face but the Lian family does. Be sensible and quickly hand the marriage certificate over to me! It is only proper that an elder handles this matter!\u201dLian Fang Zhou\u2019s eyes stared coldly at her. With her complexion darkened, she said icily: \u201cDon\u2019t act as an elder in front of me! In the end, you just want the ten liang, right? Let me tell you, you better kill off that desire! This is my own marriage, why can\u2019t I dissolve it myself? Old woman Yang, do you actually want to break it off or not. If not then get the hell out of here, prepare an eight-man sedan and lift aunt here to marry into your house.\u201d\u201cYou, you are simply shameless! Is this what a girl should say?\u201d Mrs. Qiao was trembling in fury.Aunt Zhang seeing the situation quickly tried to smooth things over saying: \u201cMrs. Qiao, no need to worry! We came here to witness. All we need to do is watch quietly. This matter, the earlier it is settled the better, right?\u201d\u201cYou see Aunt Zhang, in this village, how can there be such shameless girl!\u201d Mrs. Qiao angrily complained: \u201cI was doing it for her own good! Not knowing shame and breaking off the engagement herself, could she possibly have any good reputation now? In the future, who will marry her? Listen, from her lips there wasn\u2019t a single good word.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about this,\u201d Lian Fang Zhou sneered and said: \u201ceven if your aunt here, in this life, does not marry, I will not go to your family to rely on. Don\u2019t you dare try to control! Old woman Yang, is this marriage broken off or not?\u201dOld woman Yang originally wanted to anger Lian Fang Zhou and would rather give the money to Mrs. Qiao than to her. But seeing the situation develop she was speechless. What other ideas could she think of? She could only settle this early to avoid complications, so she said repeatedly: \u201cBreak off, of course, break off! Here\u2019s the ten liang. Come and bring the marriage certificate here!\u201dHaving Aunt Zhang as the witness, both parties felt more relaxed. Instantly they exchanged their things, then each of them verified the contents looking and feeling satisfied. Mrs. Qiao could only dryly look from the side.\u201cSince there\u2019s nothing else, please leave. I won\u2019t send you off.\u201d Lian Fang Zhou was satisfied and carefully pocketed the money.\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to say!\u201d old woman Yang glared at Lian Fang Zhou and said: \u201cIn the future stay far away from my son, Huai Shan! Don\u2019t seduce him anymore!\u201dLian Fang Zhou smiled as she said: \u201cI am only interested in the money, your son holds no interest for me at all! You better manage him well. It should be me saying \u2018don\u2019t let your son harass me\u2019 instead!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d old woman Yang hearing her speak about her proud son like this, couldn\u2019t help but be angered. She fiercely glared at Fang Zhou, pocketed the marriage certificate and turned to leave.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ten liang isn\u2019t much.Translated by Maggie Edited by Pete Proofread by SimpleLian Fang Zhou looked gratefully at Aunt Zhang and thanked her. Then she turned toward Mrs Qiao and said: \u201cAunt, now that there\u2019s nothing for you to do here, please leave! Ah, and also I thank you for being a witness. Really, thank you!\u201dMrs Qiao felt anger and hatred in her heart. She wanted to rush up and take the money from Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s pocket. But she knew that in these circumstances she couldn\u2019t gain any benefits. She could only harrumph bitterly and part with a sarcastic \u201cYou better look after yourself now.\u201dAunt Zhang also stood up and sighing to herself she asked: \u201cNow that this marriage matter was broken off, what plans do you have for the future?\u201dLian Fang Zhou smiled lightly while looking at her and said calmly: \u201cAunt Zhang, you said before to continue living, no matter what the days are like! I will definitely take good care of my siblings. One day we will be well off.\u201dAunt Zhang nodded her head, feeling pleased. She smiled and said: \u201cI see that you thought it through! That\u2019s good, that\u2019s right! Don\u2019t think about what your aunt said. You are a good girl. In the future, you will definitely have a good marriage. I should return now. If you ever need help with something, no need to hesitate. Just come to our house and ask, alright?\u201cThank you, Aunt Zhang! I\u2019m afraid in the future, I will trouble you a lot!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou said honestly.\u201cNext door neighbor, no trouble at all. Since you say this, I can not worry!\u201d Aunt Zhang laughed heartily and left.After sending off Aunt Zhang, Lian Fang Zhou let out a sigh of relief. She smiled towards Lian Ze and said: \u201cAt last, this matter is settled. Come, let\u2019s return\u2014 What\u2019s wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?\u201dSuddenly finding that Lian Ze was staring at her steadily, Lian Fang Zhou felt somewhat puzzled.\u201cNo, nothing!\u201d Lian Ze answered quickly. But although his mouth said one thing, his expression was definitely not like that.Lian Fang Zhou sighed: \u201cWe are a family, if there\u2019s something you want to say, then speak! What the point of hiding things from your sister?\u201d Well, even if he didn\u2019t speak, she could roughly guess what was on his mind.Lian Ze felt that what she said was reasonable, so he looked at her and said: \u201cIt\u2019s just that I feel sister changed, becoming\u2014\u201d\u201cNot the same as before?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou helped him finish the sentence.Lian Ze nodded.Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s face clouded and she laughed bitterly: \u201cAh Ze, there\u2019s a phrase saying the present cannot be compared to the past, this saying fits us! Now, today and the past are not the same. We are orphans. Your sister thought it through. The only way for us is to become stronger and more powerful. Otherwise, everyone will bully us. Even not stepping on other\u2019s toes will cause more gossip and ridicule; good people like Aunt Zhang are very few! Sister is not afraid of fighting and becoming a shrew. I also won\u2019t let anyone bully us! Do you understand?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry sister!\u201d Lian Ze hearing her explanation felt guilty and also moved.Lian Fang Zhou repeatedly pat his shoulder: \u201cWhat are you sorry for, we are family. There\u2019s no need for this. We must carry on living happily. This way dad and mom in heaven will be at peace, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u201cOk!\u201d Lian Ze was convinced as well as ashamed! He thought to himself: Damn, what am I overthinking this for!\u201cSister, from now on I will work hard to let our family live happily!\u201d Lian Ze promised.\u201cGreat, Sister believes in you!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled faintly. It is good that he has the determination and the will to fight.For lunch, the four siblings had sweet potato, then, in the afternoon, Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze busied themselves working in the garden.They already fertilized the pepper soil in the morning and did digging in some places. So, besides tidying up, just a little work was left to do.Once the two reached the garden, they saw a group of fist-sized little chicks spreading out happily across the plots looking for food.Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t help but frown, she was thankful they haven\u2019t planted seeds yet. If there had been planted or sprouted seeds there, then all that work would be ruined now.\u201cThese are aunt\u2019s chicks\u201d Lian Ze frowned as he spoke. His face showing a bit of annoyance.Lian Fang Zhou looked around: \u201cActually our garden\u2019s fence isn\u2019t that good. Definitely not strong enough. In a few days let\u2019s go up the mountain and get some bamboo and tree branches to fix it. For now, let\u2019s leave the problem alone since we haven\u2019t planted anything yet.\u201dLian Ze nodded: \u201cIf we fixed the fence and these chicks still entered, then it is definitely aunt putting them in on purpose. Having a reason, we can go up to their door and ask! But sister didn\u2019t you say these two days that you want to sow seeds? How about I bring Qing\u2019Er and Che\u2019Er up the mountain to gather the branches now?\u201dAt this time, Lian Fang Zhou came up with a new idea in her head. She laughed lightly and answered: \u201cNo need to rush with the sowing. It can wait.\u201dLian Ze froze. He didn\u2019t know what was she planning inside her head.Seeing that things were nearly done, Lian Fang Zhou left to return home first.Although the inside of their home was barely more than the four walls, but it still needs some good cleaning. What was done this morning, was only a rough tidying up.Both Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che were watching the house; they didn\u2019t go out to play. Seeing their sister come home to clean, they also, like shadows, followed behind to help out.Lian Fang Zhou was both moved and sad. She couldn\u2019t brush off their good will, so she smiled and let them be. Occasionally, she allowed them to help and pass certain things to her; the two siblings agreed loud and clearly. They were extremely happy.After she cleaned up properly, Lian Fang Zhou boiled another pot of water. While she was sitting by the stove watching the fire, she was also silently calculating how to use the ten silver liang.The roof and the windows definitely needed some fixing or else, once winter arrived, when wind and rain leaked through the cracks, what could they do? This household couldn\u2019t afford a person to get sick.And there were also winter clothes, quilt and some other things that needed to be purchased. For the same reason\u2014 to prevent illness!If there was anything left over after that, she had to think how to maximize the purchase of food to fill the belly\u2014 Ah, I nearly forgot!She still had to ask about the matter of seeds.Last night she asked a lot of questions to Lian Fang Qing and now she could approximately understand the family situation.The three acres of paddy field need rice seeds, but she didn\u2019t know how much money would that require. There was also the farming equipment; she also wanted to buy some feed for the ducks and chickens.Lian Fang Zhou sighed. Ten liang doesn\u2019t seem to be little but it is also not much!If she knew earlier then she would demand twenty liang. But, she wasn\u2019t sure if they would give it! Ugh, what is the point of thinking about this now!She couldn\u2019t help breaking into a self-deprecating laugh.When she was preparing to make dinner, she nearly saw the bottom of the rice jar and looking at the pile in the corner of their attic, only four pitiful packets of rice could be seen. Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t help feeling her mood worsen a bit.With only this little food, even if they made sweet potato porridge, she was afraid that there wasn\u2019t enough for one family of four to eat until the new year. Not to mention the next year\u2019s harvest time.Lian Fang Zhou smiled bitterly.After dinner, Lian Fang Zhou told Lian Ze to boil water for the twins to bathe. She herself prepared to visit Aunt Zhang \u2018s home.Even though the family was poor, they still had to be clean and neat. For every one of them to become like a striped cat, with the whole body covered in odor sweat\u2026 She wouldn\u2019t allow it!But even if the water didn\u2019t need money, was there none required for the firewood too?Once Lian Fang Qing heard that her sister wanted to go out, she jumped up and held her hand, clamoring to go togetherLian Fang Zhou thought that with one more person courage improves, so she nodded to agree and smiled as she held Lian Fang Qing\u2019s hand.The person who opened the door for them had her hair in a roll up flat bun.1It was a young, short, tanned woman wearing a brown lattice-patterned clothes.Lian Fang Zhou mind went blank for a moment, but while she was still thinking how to greet, Lian Fang Qing already smiling, called in a spoiled and clear voice: \u201cSister Zhao!\u201dLian Fang Zhou only then understood that this was Aunt Zhang\u2019s daughter in law! She smiled and called out \u201cSister Zhao!\u201d[ TL Note : This is a way to address a married woman in the same age group that is in good relations with you, but not blood-related. ]Mrs Zhao seeing Lian Fang Qing\u2019s blinding smile cried out and reached to her head. But towards Lian Fang Zhou, she just showed withdrawn politeness. With a reserved nod and smile that didn\u2019t reach her eyes, she asked: \u201cDid Fang Zhou came to look for our Ah Juan?\u201dLian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t help but wonder in her heart; when did she offend Mrs Zhao. But this wasn\u2019t the time to be thinking about that. So she smiled politely: \u201cNo, I came to find Aunt Zhang, but don\u2019t know if Aunt Zhang is here\u2014\u201d\u201cIs it Lian Fang Zhou? Quickly, come in!\u201d Aunt Zhang hearing the voices outside was already smiling as she came out to greet the guest.Lian Fang Qing then let go of her sister\u2019s hand, happily called Aunt Zhang and ran towards her. Aunt Zhang laughed heartily as she replied and held her in her arms.Lian Fang Zhou also was busily replying and heading in that direction, but she heard Mrs Zhao behind her whisper in a level tone: \u201cI don\u2019t know what they came for again\u2026 The nerve to trouble other people\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Gifting Chicken EggsTranslated by Maggie Edited by Pete Proofread by SimpleAnd there\u2019s no chapter 8!Lian Fang Zhou laughed to herself bitterly: This \u2018respected one\u2019 really is\u2014-What could she say!She could only endure!Aunt Zhang and her husband, Li Da Mu were frank people. Seeing her they smiled charmingly in greetings.Aunt Zhang knew that Fang Zhou definitely wouldn\u2019t drop by just to play and also being afraid that the girl was shy, she took the initiative instead of waiting for the visitor to speak and prompted with a smile: \u201cIf there\u2019s something that you need from us just ask, we are not strangers, no need for fake courtesy or to feel embarrassed!\u201dLian Fang Zhou suddenly felt warmth in her heart; she wasn\u2019t easily moved by other people, but at this moment she felt heat and flutters in her chest. And the overwhelming warmth, the kind brought by the best of humanity.She couldn\u2019t help but secretly make a vow: If in the future her family becomes rich, she would definitely pay them back well.\u201cSince you said it like this, it\u2019s just that there\u2019s something I want to trouble you with!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled as she said: \u201cIt\u2019s like this, since winter is nearly here, I want to fix the roof and the windows in our house. But I don\u2019t know where to buy the tiles and the timbers, I also don\u2019t know the proper the price, so I wanted to inquire with Uncle Li\u2026\u2026\u201dOnce Aunt Zhang heard this, she slapped her leg, nodded and said, \u201cOf course, your home\u2019s windows definitely need fixing! You\u2019re all young, when winter comes, you shouldn\u2019t be cold. It was thoughtful of you to think of this at this time!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u201d Li Da Mu also smiled and said: \u201cThe temperature is high this autumn, the price of tiles and the like is lower now than when buying in the winter. Approximately twenty Li from here is a stone quarry that has a manufacturer specializing in tiles and bricks. Tomorrow when I have time, I\u2019ll take Lian Ze for a trip. Our family has an oxcart, I\u2019ll help you transport them back.[ TL Note : 1 Li is roughly 500 meters. ]\u201cUncle Li, that\u2019s very kind of you! I\u2019m sorry to trouble you so much!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou felt both grateful and guilty in her heart. With a smile, she said: \u201cI can\u2019t really refuse. Thank you\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, no need to be polite! That one time your parents helped us a lot. So in the future don\u2019t say these kinds of words, please\u201d Li Da Mu shook hands, his tanned face breaking into a simple and honest smile.Lian Fang Zhou nodded, promised with \u2018Ah\u2019 and agreed on a time for departure; then took Lian Fang Qing to return home.Once they got back and discussed this matter, Lian Fang Zhou asked Lian Ze: \u201cOur family has two old hens, right? Have they laid any eggs yet?\u201d\u201cAre we going to have eggs tomorrow morning?!\u201d Lian Fang Qing\u2019s eyes lit up. Her face was full of expectation and excitement.Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t bear to see her disappointed, so she smiled as she nodded: \u201cYes, tomorrow morning sister will make some fried eggs for you all to eat, are you happy?\u201d\u201cReally! It\u2019s great!\u201d Lian Fang Qing clapped her hands as she cheered.Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze looked at each other, the two of them smiled faintly, but their hearts were clouded.\u201cThe eggs are here.\u201d Lian Ze turned around, brought over a basket and seeing that Lian Fang Zhou was counting, offered: \u201cA total of 41. The salt we use, the oil and sister\u2019s needle and thread were all bought with the money from selling the eggs. I originally wanted to save up to a hundred and then take them all to the city to sell.\u201dFang Zhou couldn\u2019t help sighing: \u201cIn the future don\u2019t sell them! For the matter of salt and oil, we\u2019ll think of another way! In the future, besides leaving some for hatching chicks, keep the rest for Qing\u2019Er and Che\u2019Er to eat! They are still young, right now their bodies are growing, it\u2019s not allowed to let them suffer poor meals! Or else in the future, we will regret it!\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll listen to sister!\u201d Lian Ze nodded.\u201cIn fact, you are also a big child, we should also really give you some nourishment, it\u2019s a pity that our family now\u2014\u201d\u201cSISTER!\u201d Lian Ze was noticeably angry and interrupted Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s sentence, he said unhappily: \u201cI\u2019m not little! I\u2019m a man. I should be taking care of the family. In the future, I need to marry sister off!\u201dOnce Lian Fang Zhou saw his reaction, she regretted what she just said a little bit, knowing that he was a person with high self-esteem, and said quickly: \u201cYes, yes. Sister spoke wrongly! You are truly a big reliable man.\u201dLian Ze didn\u2019t forgive her for her previous words just because she said this. He looked at her and said: \u201cThere will be a day when sister will believe me!\u201d and turned to leave.Lian Fang Zhou slightly shook her head and laughed. She took a clean basket, picked 30 eggs carefully placing them inside and stored the rest for later.Then, carrying the basket with eggs inside, she went out toward Aunt Zhang\u2019s house.She lightly knocked on the courtyard\u2019s door. When Mrs Zhao opened the door and saw her, she couldn\u2019t help but give the girl a killing glare: \u201cWhy did you come again? Making so many trips today to my house, are you taking this for a city\u2019s gate?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry to disturb you, Sister Zhao!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou hurriedly apologized with a smile. She glanced at the basket in her hands and said: \u201cTomorrow I will trouble Uncle Li, so I felt I couldn\u2019t do nothing in return, but our home doesn\u2019t have much money. These eggs are to show some gratitude, there\u2019s not much, but please accept them sister Zhao. Don\u2019t reject!\u201dMrs Zhao was stunned, let out an embarrassed \u2018Oh\u2019,and smiled: \u201cSo it\u2019s like this\u2026 Then you can bring it in and tell Uncle and Aunt\u2026\u201cNo need be this troublesome! I still need to return to make dinner! Handing it over to Sister is all the same!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled as she said. Then she handed over the basket.\u201cThis, that\u2019s too kind of you! It\u2019s better that you take it back!\u201d Mrs Zhao glanced at the basket of eggs, rubbed her hands and smiled.\u201cSister if you say words like this I will feel awkward!\u201d how could Lian Fang Zhou not hear the pretense of refusal in Mrs Zhao\u2019s words. With a smile, she forced the basket into the woman\u2019s hands.\u201cAh!\u201d Mrs Zhao smiled as she held the basket, saying happily: \u201cEarly tomorrow I\u2019ll send the basket back!\u201d\u201cSister, you can send it back anytime, it\u2019s just a basket!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled as she took her leave.Mrs Zhao closed the yard\u2019s door, happily count the eggs in the basket, then saw her husband, Li San Ge coming over rather abruptly: \u201cWhat are these?\u201d\u201cAiya!\u201d Mrs Zhao was startled, patted her chest and stared at him saying: \u201cYou scared me to death! Where did you pop out from!\u201dShe giddily retold Li San Ge the situation with Lian Fang Zhou and eggs. She sighed happily: \u201cNow that I think about it, this Fang Zhou, ah, this is the first time she came over to offer something and not to ask for something! She seems liked a changed person now and understands how to be a human!\u201dLi San Ge hearing this started to wrinkled frown, he asked in an accusing tone: \u201cWho told you to take those, those siblings already don\u2019t have it easy!Mrs Zhao unhappily said: \u201cWhat are you saying? In this village, isn\u2019t everyone barely able to survive? You tell me, who has it easy? Do we have it easy?\u201d\u201cAiya, I can\u2019t explain everything clearly in one hour and a half!\u201d Li San Ge said: \u201cIn short, you are not allowed to accept! Return it quickly and be careful, because if father and mother learn about this, you\u2019ll be scolded!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not returning! I just won\u2019t!\u201d Mrs Zhao was dissatisfied: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I asked for it, they took the initiative to gift it! Only idiots would give this back! Anyway, if you don\u2019t tell father and mother, how would they know?\u201d\u201cWhat won\u2019t you tell us? Huh, what is that in your hand, Mei Zi!\u201d Aunt Zhang just came out of the house, and hearing the last sentence couldn\u2019t help asking.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The two family\u2019s relationshipTranslated by Maggie Edited by SimpleLike the previous chapter said, there\u2019s no chapter 8! As it is an notice on the raw!__________________________________________________________________The Li San Ge couple looked at each other, knowing they couldn\u2019t hide it from her. So Li San Ge told her the truth.He hadn\u2019t even finished speaking when Aunt Zhang full of anger said: \u201cMei Zi what were you doing?! Those four siblings are really pitiful, it\u2019s fine that we can\u2019t help them out, by why do you still want their stuff? These eggs, I don\u2019t know how long it took them to save this much, what a pity, you\u2026 look at you! Oh, quickly return them!\u201dMrs Qiao was very unwilling, her face sank. \u201cMother, what are you saying? What did I do wrong for you to talk to me like this! Our family helped them out so much and I just accepted some eggs, isn\u2019t this over the top? And it wasn\u2019t me who asked for it, it was Lian Fang Zhou herself who gifted it. I did say no need; she forcefully stuffed it into my hands. How did it become my fault? I don\u2019t understand why you help them that much, our family isn\u2019t like those rich noble families; I would return it. What did I do this for? I did it for the family. I didn\u2019t say I accept these eggs to hide it and secretly eat them.Mrs Qiao felt aggrieved and her eyes reddened, she fiercely placed the basket on the ground, turned and ran inside the house.Li San Ge saw that his mother was angered to the point that her expression changed to a look of anger; he immediately rush to say: \u201cMother, she\u2019s immature, no need to stoop to her level! You really shouldn\u2019t be so angry, In a moment I\u2019ll get her to apologize to you! These eggs, let ah Juan return them the Lian sibling.\u201cAh!\u201d Aunt Zhang sighed again and said: \u201cMother isn\u2019t angry with your wife; what she said is also not wrong, it\u2019s only that our family is wrong! Later, please explain to her, let her understand the situation. San Ge, ah, that year your father helped someone lift some timber and broke his leg, he rested for nearly a year and couldn\u2019t stand up and couldn\u2019t work. How much did your Lian family\u2019s aunt and uncle help us out? At that time we were poor and had no money to get medicine for your father; I went to their house to borrow some money. Afterwards I found out your Aunt Lian sold her own dowry to scrape for money, or else your father\u2019s leg would have been crippled! You didn\u2019t forget this right?\u201d\u201cMother!\u201d Li San Ge said: \u201cHow could I forget? You and Father already told Ah Juan and I. I won\u2019t ever forget! Uncle Lian and Aunt Lian are good people, Now their family is in difficulty, it\u2019s right that we should help out!\u201d\u201cIf you can think like this then it alright!\u201d Aunt Zhang said relieved: \u201cBeing a person you must live with conscience, God is watching! There\u2019s an old saying, a drop of water shall be returned with a burst of spring. (TLN:It means -Even if it was just a little help from others, you should return the favor with all you can when others are in need.) Actually, we can\u2019t help them much, we can only give them a hand! Since it\u2019s like this and we still accept their things, how can our heart\u2019s not feel terrible? Can\u2019t your parents still have some face!\u201d\u201cMother, you are right! I already know, you can be at ease! It\u2019s just that Mei\u2019er doesn\u2019t know about this family matter, once I tell her and she knows, it should be fine!\u201d Li San Ge persuaded Aunt Zhang again for a while, and said: \u201cI\u2019ll tell Ah Juan to send the eggs back to Lian family!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better that I personally make the trip!\u201d Aunt Zhang sighed: \u201cIf Ah Juan goes, I\u2019m afraid she might not take them back! I need to talk to her, in the future to not be like this!\u201dAunt Zhang said, then carried the basket of eggs to the Lian family.When she arrived at Lian\u2019s home, it was the time that the four siblings were having dinner.Seeing the half pot of water with not much rice sweet potato porridge, Aunt Zhang couldn\u2019t help feel but sad.When the siblings saw Aunt Zhang, they hurriedly stood up to greet her; Lian Fang Zhou happily called \u201cAunt Zhang.\u201d Once she saw the basket of eggs, she understood what was the matter\u2014\u201cFang Zhou!\u201d She didn\u2019t have the time to open her mouth when she saw that Aunt Zhang\u2019s face sank and said, \u201cWhat is the meaning of this, girl? Are you looking down on your aunt and uncle, is that it? When did our two families start being so aloof? If I am still your aunt, then you better put away these eggs. In the future, if you need help, just say so; you\u2019re not allowed to send gifts anymore! Or else, I\u2019ll take these eggs and in the future, you won\u2019t need to step a foot through our house door!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d for a moment Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t say anything, after a while she put on a forced smile: \u201cAunt, I\u2014\u201d\u201cJust say it! These eggs, will you take them or not!\u201d Aunt Zhang glared at her.Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s mouth felt stiff, with a heavy heart.What else could she say?\u201cTake, I\u2019ll take it!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou hurriedly nodded: \u201cAunt, you and Uncle Li are really good people, in the future, I will definitely repay you guys back!\u201d\u201cNow it\u2019s fine!\u201d Aunt Zhang\u2019s face loosened up, and carefully put down the basket, smiling she said: \u201ctalk about future matters in the future. If there was a day you make a fortune, then I don\u2019t mind you repaying us! Haha, OK, leave these eggs to eat them yourself, You siblings are at your growth period and should eat better! If there\u2019s no more food, come tell aunt, aunt will help you think of something!\u201dNaturally, Lian Fang Zhou will not push such a big problem to someone else, but she didn\u2019t want to brush off Aunt Zhang\u2019s kindness; so she nodded and smiled. \u201cIf there are any difficulties, I will find aunt!\u201d\u201cNow that is right!\u201d Ah, I will tell you, this is aunt\u2019s last time saying this, if you ever be aloof again, aunt will really be angry!\u201d Once she got Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s reply, Aunt Zhang then contently left.\u201cAunt Zhang and the others are really good people!\u201d Lian Ze said.\u201cYes!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou lightly sighed, her eyes seemed slightly heavy. Slowly she said: \u201cEven though Aunt Zhang and the others are only neighbors, they treat us very well; some people are clearly blood-related, but can\u2019t wait to force us into ruin! Ah Ze, tell me, towards these people who\u2019s conscience is being gnawed by dogs, should we be polite?\u201dOnce Lian Ze heard these words, he felt like something is about to happen. His eyes narrowed and he said: \u201cSister, what are you thinking of doing?\u201dLian Fang Zhou with a faint cold smile on her lips said: \u201cIn a while, you\u2019ll know! Okay, first, let\u2019s eat dinner!\u201dAfter tidying up dinner, Lian Fang Zhou then told Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che to obediently stay at home.\u201cWe will make a trip to Uncle and Aunt\u2019s home!\u201d\u201cGo to their home? To do what?\u201d Lian Ze stared blankly.Lian Fang Zhou mischievously smiled: \u201cOf course to go get what was originally our things. Or should it be gifting them money?\u201d\u201cWhat is Sister saying\u2014-\u201d\u201cThose over thousands catty of paddies!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou harrumphed: \u201cHow could we let them off lightly!\u201dLian Ze eyes darkened, quietly he said: \u201cSister, let\u2019s just leave it! Uncle and Aunt won\u2019t return them to us!\u201dAt the time when the three acres of paddy fields\u2019 rice matured, Uncle and Aunt hurriedly harvested, they themselves thought they were kindly helping out. Who knew after the harvest, they only gave them three or four bagfuls, and the rest one thousand were privately pocketed.Once Lian Ze thought about this matter, he felt both remorseful and guilty. What kind of people are Uncle and Aunt, it\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t know. Why would he think that they were kindhearted!It\u2019s not like he never asked, but once he opened his mouth, Aunt will then yell. This matter, it could only be left it at that.However, Lian Fang Zhou has everything thought out and indifferently said: \u201cthey, however, may not have the choice to not give! Let\u2019s go, when the time comes, don\u2019t say anything, I\u2019ll do the talking!\u201dYou heartless people, not allowing me to vote. (TLN:I think it means that they don\u2019t allow her to have a say in something.)Seeing Lian Fang Zhou persistent to go, and that Lian Ze couldn\u2019t persuade her, he was afraid that she\u2019ll be at a disadvantage, so he decided to go together with her.Simple here: Sorry for the late release and the unedited chapter, our main editor for this series kinda left without saying anything.

Demanding the grain.Translated by Maggie Edited by SimpleLian Fang Zhou\u2019s uncle Lian Li\u2019s home wasn\u2019t far from theirs. The yard\u2019s door was high and big, a neat house, their life doesn\u2019t seem too bad.Once Mrs Qiao saw the two of them, she thought of yesterday\u2019s matter of old woman Yang dissolving the marriage. Suddenly, her anger couldn\u2019t help but burst out. Glaring at Lian Fang Zhou, she snapped: \u201cWhat have you come here for! Get out of here!\u201dHowever, Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t leave; instead, she entered the main hall and found a stool to sit on. She said: \u201cWe came to take back what was originally ours! What did Aunt think we came here for?\u201d\u201cPresumptuous!\u201d Lian Li\u2019s face darkened, in a teaching tone he said: \u201cLian Fang Zhou, what kind of attitude is that? Is that how you talk to an elder!\u201d\u201cOh, so Uncle remembered you are an elder!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou laughed coldly: \u201cScheming for our stuff, bullying us parentless siblings. Are those the things that an elder would do! Uncle, Aunt, my parents in heaven are watching!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Lian Li was angered by her until his chest hurt and spat out \u201cPah, stop mentioning your parents when discussing! We owe you nothing! You say we bullied you, do you any evidence? If you have no evidence then don\u2019t speak nonsense! Seeing that you are still young and immature, I won\u2019t hold it against you, so you just need to apologize and quickly leave. Go do what you should be doing!\u201dHe said with a deep stare directed towards Lian Fang Zhou. In a heavy tone he continued saying \u201cYou are not the same as before, how did you become like this! It couldn\u2019t be that you were cursed and become evil? Fang Zhou, ah, how could a girl be such a shrew, not having one bit of family discipline. No wonder the Yang family doesn\u2019t want you! If you are like this, in this life you won\u2019t be able to marry off!\u201d\u201cUncle, how can you say that about my sister!\u201d Lian Ze was furious, he couldn\u2019t endure it and clenched his fists by his side.Lian Fang Zhou gently pulled him, indicating that he was a being impatient. Toward Lian Li, she smiled and lightly said: \u201cWhy did I become like this? It\u2019s because mother told me a kind horse would be ridden and a kind person would be bullied in my dreams. So I became like this. Me having family discipline or not, this matter does not need uncle to worry about. Since following you I won\u2019t learn anything good. And the Yang family not wanting me seems to be none of your business, right? If I marry off or not, that seems to be even more none of your business. You don\u2019t need to talk about these matters to upset me since I actually don\u2019t care! \u201cLian Fang Zhou sneered in her heart, still treating her as though she is still respectable!But if she was respectable, hearing his words, she was afraid she would already be angered until she\u2019s half dead.Since this is ancient times, if you spoke poisonous words like breaking off the engagement, or can\u2019t marry off, shrewish and has no family discipline to an unmarried girl, how could she bear it.Otherwise, seeing how Lian Ze react you\u2019ll know.Lian Li never thought that Lian Fang Zhou would be this calm, in an indifferent mood, she refuted each and every one of his words. That uncaring attitude doesn\u2019t seem to be an act.For a moment, he was stunned; he had the feeling of receiving a blow, a perplexed feeling.Mrs Qiao saw that her husband was shaken, she was filled with resentment and sneered: \u201chaving no face and no skin. Doesn\u2019t know shame!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! Doesn\u2019t know shame!\u201d Lian Li echoed in a heavy grave tone.\u201cWhat are you saying!\u201d Lian Ze was angered, blue veins were popping up, his face was extremely dark.\u201cAh Ze, no need to be angry!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou was completely relaxed, heartily laughing \u201cDefinitely kind people saying kind words, if you have not said enough, please continue! It\u2019s best that you even scold my whole eighteen generation of ancestors too! When you are finished scolding, we\u2019ll get down to business!.\u201dLian Li was trembling with anger; he couldn\u2019t say a word as he stared at Lian Fang Zhou. He faintly felt like collapsing at any moment.Scold her eighteen generation of ancestors? Isn\u2019t her eighteen generation of ancestors his eighteen generation of ancestors too? Well, seventeen generations! This girl is definitely tricky!Lian Li harrumphed and mentally thought \u201cI\u2019m not going to lower myself to her level!\u201d then coldly asked: \u201cWhat have you actually come for? When you\u2019re done, quickly scram!\u201dSo Lian Fang Zhou said: \u201cDuring the harvest, Uncle and Aunt helped us collect the grain, us siblings can\u2019t thank you enough. Our parents in heaven definitely can\u2019t thank you enough! Uncle and Aunt have already helped us take care of them long enough, it is enough, we should take them back now!\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Mrs Qiao\u2019s anger reached its peak and started to yell: \u201cIN YOUR DREAMS!\u201dLian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t bother with her interruption and continued in the same tone: \u201cLast night, Mother came to me in my dreams, she told me to come and collect it; one thousand catties. The rest are left to show filial piety to Uncle and Aunt! Uncle and Aunt are elders, so you gotta have a bit of an appearance like elders and not be so shameless, right?\u201d\u201cStop dressing up as God, play the devil! (means to mystify)\u201d Mrs Qiao has always been the one to take from others, not the other way around.Don\u2019t mention giving, even hearing Lian Fang Zhou speaking about it made her heartbreak as if losing a piece of her flesh. Making her feel so angry she didn\u2019t feel well.She sneered: \u201cLian girl, you really gained some ability; that you even bring up your dead mother to discuss things! Hmph, don\u2019t think that you that bringing out dead people will make us scared of you, in your dreams!\u201d\u201cAunt, what you just said is not right;\u201d Lian Fang Zhou lightly said: \u201cWhat I said was the truth, not one word was trying to fool you. Otherwise, why would I dare to come to your home and say these words?\u201d\u201cIn the past, you might not, but now you have been cursed; what things would you not do!\u201d Mrs Qiao sneered.Lian Li was skeptical about two points, if not for their dead mother\u2019s words, he felt that Lian Fang Zhou would not dare come to their home to create trouble.But, he and Mrs Qiao\u2019s thoughts are the same; wanting to take grain from them, don\u2019t say door, not even the windows. (T/N:Meaning no way. You know how like you want to enter someone\u2019s house, but they don\u2019t let you enter. So you can\u2019t come through the door and even the window is blocked)Lian Li opened his eyes, steadily watching the siblings. Indifferently he said: \u201cI think your mother got it wrong, why would our home have your grain? After we helped you harvest the grain, didn\u2019t we already give it to you? Why did you come to ask for it again? You two siblings, aren\u2019t you being shameless? In your eyes, are we still your elders?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Mrs Qiao hearing her husband\u2019s justified words, grew some backbone and acted like being wronged: \u201cThere\u2019s a saying that\u2019s really good, different hearts in different breasts. (T/N: ie. It\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s going on in the minds of other people.) It really is paying kindness with evil! At the time, your Uncle and I, us two day and night, were completely exhausted helping you harvest the grain. Every single grain was given to you. But you come running to shamelessly blackmail us! What is this! We don\u2019t hope for you to show filial piety to us elders, but you also can\u2019t be this heartless with no conscience! The heavens won\u2019t spare you, Buddha won\u2019t spare you!\u201d\u201cAunt, these words, do you dare swear it\u2019s true?\u201d Lian Ze hearing Mrs Qiao started turning black to white and was angered until his head was a mess.\u201cSee! see!\u201d Mrs Qiao cried out, \u201cas a nephew, forcing his aunt to swear, is this what is has come to? The grains were fed to the dog\u2019s stomach, not understanding one bit of reason!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough, you speak less, or people will say we are bullying the younger generation!\u201d Lian Li seeing Mrs Qiao talking three, twisting two, in the end saying things with no point; couldn\u2019t help but frown and look down on her. Toward the two siblings he indifferently said: \u201cThe grains we have already given to you, now you come and want more, that\u2019s impossible!\u201d\u201cYou did give, but what was given was not all of it. Our 3 rice paddy fields should have harvested about one thousand five hundred catties; I\u2019m afraid what you have given us is not even four hundred catties!\u201d Lian Ze said angrily.\u201cHaha!\u201d Lian Li lightly sneered, with a bit of disdain, each and every word was questioned back: \u201cDo you have any evidence? Did you weigh them? Are there any witnesses or material evidence? In the end, the grains we had we gave them to you, as for how you managed the grains you got, whether it was eaten or sold, I don\u2019t know!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Wait for my mother to ask.Translated by Maggie Edited by Simple\u201cRight!\u201d Mrs Qiao\u2019s eyes lit up as well as her spirit, triumphantly she harrumphed: \u201cSeems to me, you secretly sold off the grains, then purposely pretended to be pitiful and came to our home to blackmail! Hmph, you siblings calculated well; on one side the grains are pocketed and earn money, and on the other, you come to demand grains again. This is really a cheap matter!\u201d\u201cEven though your parents aren\u2019t here, as a person you should have some conscience! Don\u2019t be so crooked!\u201d Lian Li continued to speak: \u201cOriginally, you being my nephew and niece, we can\u2019t let you off. Three times, five times fighting against our support you can be let off, but you want to trick and have a lion\u2019s big mouth; arrogantly asking for more! Asking for one thousand catties, that\u2019s too outrageous!\u201d\u201cYou, you\u2014\u2013\u201d Lian Ze was angered until he can\u2019t speak; his chest was going up and down at an erratic pace.He was really shocked and also thoroughly disappointed.He never thought his own blood-related Uncle and Aunt would have such a mouth and face. What family relationship, what blood connection, in their eyes it\u2019s not even worth a penny!At this moment, the sorrow in his heart is greater than the anger.Lian Fang Zhou lightly pulled Lian Ze\u2019s sleeve, patted his shoulder to comfort him and didn\u2019t seem to be anxious; she was not even angry. Indifferently she calmly asked: \u201c So Uncle and Aunt have decided to refuse about returning the grains to us?\u201d\u201cDream on!\u201d Mrs Qiao snorted.Lian Li was obviously more skilled than his foolish wife, immediately he said: \u201c Return what? We don\u2019t owe you anything at all, how do we return?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Mrs Qiao immediately followed up.\u201cHaha,\u201d Lian Fang Zhou lightly laughed and said: \u201cAnyway, my Mother told me to come, so I have come. The words that Mother told me to say have been said. But Uncle and Aunt are not willing to admit, so there\u2019s nothing that I can do. Oh, right, my Mother also told me, she said if you don\u2019t return it then she will personally ask you! Us two siblings will take our leave now!\u201dLian Li and Mrs Qiao both stared blankly for a moment; they didn\u2019t know what to say. This girl was sharp-tongued, a sharp needle is obviously not a good crop. Looking at her reactions, such a rough situation, unexpectedly she ended it like this?The resigned words Lian Fang Zhou said were stated very clearly, making Lian Li have a weird unreal kind of feeling.\u201cYou are going to leave, just like that?\u201d Lian Li couldn\u2019t help but ask.Lian Fang Zhou lightly smiled and said: \u201cI\u2019m not leaving just like that. I believe my mother\u2019s words, you will definitely return the grains to us!\u201d\u201cHA!\u201d Lian Li sneered toward the heavens, his gaze steadily watching the two siblings as they leave.\u201cHusband, this\u2026 why do I feel like there\u2019s something strange!\u201d Mrs Qiao stammered, she also felt a bit dubious.\u201cYou also think so?\u201d Lian Li turned his head toward her and asked: \u201cThen you say it, how is this strange?\u201dMrs Qiao thought for a bit, then said: \u201cYou ask me to say, but I can\u2019t say how I just feel that it\u2019s strange! You didn\u2019t see that when Old Woman Yang came to dissolve the engagement, that brat was so unreasonable; now suddenly, today she is not quite right!\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201d Lian Li snorted and slowly said: \u201cDidn\u2019t she say that her dead ghost mother will come to find us? Well then, let\u2019s just wait and see!\u201dMrs Qiao was scared, hurriedly she said: \u201cPeh, peh, peh! Husband, what nonsense are you saying; since everything is fine, why would she come find to us! We didn\u2019t harm her! \u201d\u201cWhat are you afraid of!\u201d Lian Li calmly looked at her: \u201cI don\u2019t believe it!\u201dMrs Qiao\u2019s heart was still jumping, her smile was strained but didn\u2019t say anything else.\u201cSister,\u201d leaving Lian Li\u2019s home, Lian Ze was upset as he followed behind Lian Fang Zhou. He said: \u201cI really didn\u2019t think that Uncle and Aunt would act like this! When dad and mom were here, they often came to our home to get some things for free; how could they say those words! Are they really our Uncle and Aunt?\u201dLian Fang Zhou briefly laughed and said: \u201cDidn\u2019t you see it? Alright now, no need to be upset, being upset because of them, that\u2019s silly!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not\u2026\u2026\u201d Lian Li himself also don\u2019t know how to explain his feelings at the moment; he just opened his mouth, closed it and lowered his head.\u201cSister, did Mother really come to you in your dream?\u201d Lian Ze couldn\u2019t help but ask, he sighed: \u201cEven if it\u2019s true, then what? I said it earlier, Uncle and Aunt wouldn\u2019t return us the grains! Sister doesn\u2019t need to worry, we will not starve to death; we just need to survive this winter. Wait until next year\u2019s harvest time, I will keep a tight watch and never let them help us again.\u201d\u201cWhat time is it now, there is still one year until harvest season!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou rolled her eyes, seeing his sad face, her heart softened; she said softly: \u201cAlright now, you can set your mind at ease, these one thousand catties, we will definitely get them back! But before that, you need to listen to my arrangements!\u201dLian Ze looked skeptical at her, Lian Fang Zhou lightly laughed; she had a well thought out plan.Early the second day, Li Da Mu prepared an ox cart to go call Lian Ze; he wanted to accompany him to the stone quarry to buy the tiles and bricks.Since bank drafts haven\u2019t been opened yet, Lian Fang Zhou grabbed a pouch with two-three hundred coins, intending to pay the deposit first.Lian Fang Zhou also wanted to go with them, now that her reputation was smeared, she should take this chance to go out. Looking at the mountain, landform, soil vegetation, and crop conditions are a good idea.Li Da Mu thought about it, then nodded with a smile.Lian Fang Qing saw this and pestered to go along with them to play; Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t allow it. She told Lian Che and her to stay at home and watch it. Lian Fang Qing\u2019s corner of her lips turned down, obviously not happy.Lian Fang Zhou saw her pitiful, full of grievances face and couldn\u2019t bear to see it; so she bent down and pulled her closer and quietly said: \u201cBe obedient and stay at home with third brother, wait until evening and sister will make fried eggs for you, OK?\u201dLian Fang Qing\u2019s face brightened up, and subconsciously licked her lips with yearning; then shook her head and said: \u201cno, eggs must be kept to sell so we can buy food.\u201dLian Fang Zhou\u2019s heart felt a sharp pain and felt sad. She softly spoke saying: \u201cThe money to buy food, sister will earn it; no need to sell eggs. From now on our eggs are for you and Che\u2019er to eat.\u201d\u201cReally?!\u201d Lian Fang Qing was bursting with joy. Hurriedly nodding her head, she also said: \u201cSister and second brother will also eat it.\u201d\u201cOK, we will eat it together.\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled.Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze sat on the cart and Li Da Mu drove it. The three of them slowly went to the stone quarry.Once outside DaFang village, Lian Fang Zhou observed the scenery on both sides. She saw that on both sides of the road were mostly undulating hills, or flat ground protruding from the middle of a hill, covered with lush green trees; she roughly looked and saw it was mostly cedar, pine, fir, maple or camphor trees.There was a lot of gentle slopes, many places had reclaimed the dry land to grow crops this season. The ground was withered and was visibly yellow. The yellow was sweet potato and taro seedlings. A number of bits and pieces were of broken bean curd rack. (ED/N Sorry guys, this paragraph was really hard to decipher.)Where there was water, it had long been opened up and turned into paddy fields. At this time, one could only see entire fields of rice stubble, now completely dry and yellow.Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t need to ask; in her heart, she could already comprehend it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Buying TilesTranslated by Maggie Edited by SimpleBuy TilesThe cart took about more than an hour, to reach the stone quarry.They passed from the edge of stone quarry village, then turn to a fork in the road, and after walking for about a quarter of an hour, they see a large field in front of the exposed loess.The middle is broad and flat, one side is the entrance, another side was a big pile of well-made brick,and another two sides was seven large and small kiln entrance that was placed along the mountain, next to the kiln entrance was piles of yellow clay, brick mold, wood kiln fire, barrels, tubs, shovels, small carts and other objects. Five or six workers wore patches of brown were busy.Seeing them come over, the owner, old villager Shi was smiling with both hands covered by the sleeves, greeted: \u201cThis brother, are you here to buy bricks or tiles ah?\u201dLi Da Mu then laughed: \u201cMy neighbor wants to repair their roof. They purposely come here to buy some tiles.\u201cOh, this way please, please! Here we got good mud; the kiln is also great, bake out the best quality tiles. Not only is it durable, but the price is also fair ah!\u201d old villager Shi smiled and led them to one side, where the pile of tiles was placed.Lian Fang Zhou smiled: \u201cWe have three rooms; one and a half need to replace old tiles. I\u2019m afraid the other one and a half have to change some. A total of two rooms should be enough! Should be a total of 50 square. Can you calculate how much we need?\u201dShe shyly smiled as she spoke: \u201cWe do not have much money, and also embarrassed to bargain the price! Since you said the price is fine, then that\u2019s fine! When we build a new house in the future, we\u2019ll come here to patronize you!\u201dLian Fang Zhou spoke very clearly, fluent words, like flowing water and as clear as noonday, making old villager Shi hearing it feel startled.Old villager Shi can\u2019t help but narrowed his half-lidded eyes and looked at the girl in front of him. Fourteen years of age, slightly thin physique, wearing old and clean coarse red floral clothes. She had a clear thin face, a pair of pupils that are bright and piercing, compact little lips carrying a slight smile. Her hair combed into completely neat, ordinary rural girl style. The whole person reveals a spirit of vigor, making the people that meet her can\u2019t help but have a good feeling inside.Old villager Shi couldn\u2019t help smile. Looking at Lian Fang Zhou, he said a few \u201cgood\u201d word. He gave a thumbs up and smiled: \u201cThe girl is really clever and refreshingly smart. Oh, I don\u2019t know which family is so blessed, to have such a good daughter! It\u2019s settled, with your words, this old man hearing it feel comfortable. The price I\u2019ll give you is the lowest, and the things also give you the best!\u201d\u201cThen many thank boss Shi!\u201d Even Fang Zhou grinned as she nodded.Since the past two days, Lian Ze became familiar with Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s tongue, so he didn\u2019t feel anything strange. However, Li Da Mu, like old villager Shi, was stunned!Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s performance just now overturned/subvert his impression of her in his mind.If it wasn\u2019t human or still that person, and the appearance didn\u2019t change, and also have Lian Ze by her side, he would be suspicious about whether the girl in front him was really Lian Fang Zhou?Li Da Mu secretly sighed: it seems that Yang dissolving the engagement and Hua family\u2019s daughter-in-law creating a scene stimulated this girl to change dramatically!\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Old villager Shi smiled as he said. Suddenly was in a teasing mood. He then turned to Lian Fang Zhou again and grinned: \u201cLittle girl ah, my tiles are this big, if you can figure out how many pieces are needed, I will give you another two percent discount, how about it?\u201dLian Fang Zhou eyes flashed, but still smiled: \u201cHow can I actually calculate that accurately, don\u2019t make fun of me.\u201dOld villager Shi waved his hand, swept away that neither long or short beard of his and laughed:\u201dI am not joking, I\u2019m serious! Haha, in fact, it\u2019s not bad to be able to calculate. As long as the difference isn\u2019t too big, then you win!\u201dSeeing the interest in old villager Shi\u2019s eyes, Lian Fang Zhou thought for a moment before she nodded politely. She chuckled: \u201cSince it\u2019s like that, then I\u2019ll give it a try. And if I\u2019m not accurate, uncle you cannot laugh at me!Old villager Shi Haha as he laughed: \u201cI won\u2019t, I won\u2019t. Go count for us to see.\u201dThe workers who were working heard this looked at Lian Fang Zhou. Such a small young girl, to actually be able to count. They couldn\u2019t help but be curious. They have stopped whatever labor they were doing and gathered around to watch the spectacle and gossiped quietly.Lian Fang Zhou took a tile, estimated with her finger. She determined the length and width of the good and computed the area. The floor had a thin layer of loess. She readily folded a small branch and squatted down to draw on the ground.All the workers have never seen the Arabic numerals(i.e. 1234\u2026). Seeing her on the ground, they could not help but wonder as if seeing something strange. One couldn\u2019t help but ask the old villager Shi: \u201cBoss Shi, what is this little girl writing?\u201cThat\u2019s right, what is that word? Really strange!\u201d\u201cAin\u2019t that right, never saw it before.\u201d\u201cI say, is this even a word? Why do I feel this is like the five cloud view of Master Zhang\u2019s painted character ah!Everyone that heard this could not help start laughing.Lian Ze saw them laughing at Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t help but blush. He exclaimed: \u201cSince my sister dares to try, then it\u2019ll work. What are you laughing at? What\u2019s so funny!\u201dTN:so cute <3 wish I had such a cute bro.Everyone heard this and laughed more loudly. While laughing, they also tease Lian Ze.Old villager Shi coughed twice, then it stopped.Lian Fang Zhou smiled, neither defending herself nor felt embarrassed. But she moved on like a flow of water as working on it.In fact, this was elementary math. Just need two or three sentences of working out, and she finished calculating. She smiled as she reported a number. At the same time, she stood up conveniently erasing the numbers on the ground with her foot.\u201cThat fast?\u201d old villager Shi was stunned, everyone was also shocked.Calculating without an abacus, but also so fast, was very frightening!\u201cBoss, is it right, is it right? \u201d Everyone talked over each other, filled with impatient.Old villager Shi stared: right or not right, how was he to know? He also needs to calculate before knowing!Without waiting for his order, a worker had already speedily run to bring the abacus and handed it to him with both hands. Countless pairs of eyes watched him.\u201cSister, did you count it accurately ah?\u201d Lian Ze could not help whispering to Lian Fang Zhou. Li Da Mu was also concerned and looked over.Neither fast nor slow, Lian Fang Zhou glanced at Boss Shi who was working on the abacus with the beads fly away. She beamed: \u201cWait til Boss Shi finishes counting then we will know it!Her carefree look and gentle smile made the uneasy Lian Ze settle down straight away. Lian Ze blurted: \u201cI believe that her sister must be right.\u201cOh?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou laughed, \u201cWhy?\u201dLian Ze stubbornly said: \u201cI do not know. Anyway, I just believe in my sister.\u201dLian Fang Zhou gave a satisfied nod and smiled: \u201cGood brother.\u201d\u201cAmazing! Really amazing!\u201d old villager Shi looked at the figures on the abacus, was shocked speechless.\u201cIt is accurate!\u201d\u201cNo way! It\u2019s right!\u201dAll the workers were also surprised.Li Da Mu and Lian Ze\u2018s heart fell to the ground. The two of them looked at each other with a giant grin. They are happy for Lian Fang Zhou.Someone could not help but said: \u201cBoss, how about you count it again?\u201dOld villager Shi slapped back of that person\u2019s head; his eyes glared: \u201cYou ability killer! What? You suspect that I count it wrong!\u201d\u201cNo no \u2026 \u2026\u201d The man\u2019s face turned red. He hurriedly denied, which attracted everyone laughter.\u201cWhat are you laughing at! What so funny! Still not hurrying to do work!\u201d old villager Shi glared at everyone.Everyone obediently answered, but could not help look at Lian Fang Zhou a few more times. They went away gossiping.\u201cBoss Shi, does what you have just said, still count?\u201d Li Da Mu laughed.\u201cOf course! Of course, it counts\u201d old villager Shi simply nodded, toward the Lian Fang Zhou. He put up a thumb: \u201cMiss Lian is the most intelligent girl I have ever seen, really! But, Miss Lian, just now the drawing on the ground. What are those thing?\u201dSimple here: Sorry everyone for the late edited release, I had RL problems, for now everything is taken care of; so I should be able to get these chapters edited the day Maggie is done TLing them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was after she agreed to try, that she remembered this country has no Arabic numerals; seeing that old Villager Shi asked about it, she smiled faintly feeling somewhat awkward and said: \u201cIn fact, it is my own unique way of calculating, using code.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d She didn\u2019t know if Old villager Shi believed it or not because he couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cMiss Lian what method did you use to calculate so fast?\u201dLian Fang Zhou chuckled saying, \u201cI calculated mentally!\u201dThe world is full of wonders, and some people are born with mental arithmetic calculation, this is not an impossible thing. Old villager Shi then laugh and exclaimed, \u201cthis old one can be regarded as my eyes being opened today! Living for more than half of my life, I have never seen such a powerful mental arithmetic ability; Miss Lian is really good!\u201d\u201cInsects have small skills, I can not afford to be complimented by you!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou hurriedly smiled with modesty, and said: \u201d Since this number is also calculated clearly, we should go back! \u201d\u201cOh, wait a moment!\u201d Old villager Shi readily agreed, one hand waved for two workers to come over and told them to bring out the tiles that they needed and to help put on them on the cart.The big cart couldn\u2019t hold it all, it was estimated it needed to make three to four trips to carry it all; it was a total of 22 silver. With a discount of twenty percent, it is one liang and six pennies, Lian Fang Zhou smiled as she gave thanks.Old villager Shi happily laughed with a straightforward \u201cit\u2019s what we should be doing,\u201d complimenting that she understood proper manners.Since the home side also a needed help unloading, Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze followed the cart back. On the return trip, the siblings naturally wouldn\u2019t be sitting on the cart, but walking alongside it.Li Da Mu originally told the siblings to sit on the carriage along the edge, but Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze refused.Li Da Mu couldn\u2019t let it go, he originally wanted to call tell them to get on, but whatever was said Lian Fang Zhou was still unwilling. \u201cToday, the whole day we have troubled Uncle Li, and this cattle is also expensive, if we tired it out, not only you, we would also feel bad. It\u2019s better for us to walk.\u201dLi Da Mu suddenly could not say anything, sighing he then laughed and said: \u201cAlright, Fang Zhou you are getting better and better at speaking and speaking so logically! I can\u2019t beat what you are saying, I shall accompany you and we will go together!\u201dHe said and jumped out of the coachman\u2019s position.Lian Zhou and Lian Ze didn\u2019t say anymore, the three stared at each other and laughed.The cart had to go slowly, but it also took a long time to load and unload. They were busy until the sun started setting and finished working. This is also with the help of Aunt Zhang, Li Juan, and Mrs Zhao unloading.\u201cTomorrow should be a sunny day, do not delay anymore! Tomorrow your San Ge and I will help you change these new tiles on, at the same time collect the old tiles.\u201d(TLN-Li Da Mu)The so-called collecting is the meaning of maintenance.Lian Fang Zhou smiled as she said her thanks.The next day was also a completely busy day, they had to repair the roof.\u201cThe hemp paper that this paste window needs, it is only sold in the county city center, wait until the end of the month when your Aunt Zhang goes to the market. At that time, you will go together and see what other things you need to buy, and buy it in one go!\u201d said Li Da Mu.Lian Fang Zhou also had this plan, so she smiled and agreed, repeatedly giving her thanks.Raising her head and looking at the new roof, a sense of accomplishment and a sense of fullness rose spontaneously; Lian Ze also sighed, he couldn\u2019t help but say: \u201cNow it is fine, no longer we will have to be afraid of the next heavy rain! And also not be afraid of winter\u201dLian Fang Zhou faintly smiled: \u201cYes, ah! Wait until we fix the windows, we will also buy two cotton quilts, and get some thick cloth to keep as winter clothes. We will no longer have to worry about winter \u2013 there is no need to be anxious, it is now only the end of September! We Still have time!\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d Lian Ze smiled as he nodded. \u201cI will listen to sister! But, what are cotton quilts, ah?\u201dLian Ze was somewhat puzzled and asked.\u201cWhat?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou almost could not believe her ears, with eyes wide open she stared at him, \u201cwhat did you say?\u201d\u201cI -\u201d Lian Ze was a scared by her gaze, and for a moment he was speechless.When Lian Fang Zhou realized that, she hurriedly toned down her look. \u201cWill you repeat it again?\u201dLian Ze puzzledly glanced at her, then said: \u201cI am asking sister what are (cotton) quilts, I have never heard of it, ah! Is not \u2026 A very expensive thing, ah?\u201d(Cotton) quilt? Very expensive?Lian Fang Zhou felt like crying but had no tears; hurriedly she said: \u201cYou have never heard of quilts? Do you know what cotton is?\u201d\u201cCotton \u2026 \u2026\u201d Lian Ze shook his head and asked: \u201cWhat is that flower? Does it Look pretty? The matured fruits, are they tasty?\u201dLian Fang Zhou was stunned, it can\u2019t be that this dynasty doesn\u2019t have cotton? She touched the clothes, it is fine linen material. It seems that quilts and bed sheets are also of this material, then\u2014\u201cThose quilts that we use, what is stuffed inside them?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou hurriedly askedLian Ze looked at her weirdly, but still replied: \u201cOf course they are kapok, reed flowers, and burlap, or what else did sister think it was? Sister, it can\u2019t be that you have even forgotten this amount of common sense, right?\u201dLian Fang Zhou\u2019s mind was messy, and ignored the doubt in the meaning of his words; she hurriedly asked again, \u201cother family\u2019s quilts are also stuffed with these things?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Lian Ze naturally nodded, then said: \u201cBut not all, I heard that in the really rich men\u2019s homes, the quilt are filled with silk.\u201dIt seems that this era really doesn\u2019t have cotton or its plant. This is really \u2026Lian Fang Zhou suddenly felt her heart and head was empty; she could not help but blurt out:, \u201cThis kind of quilt, would it be warm being covered with it? Can we survive the winter\u2026?\u201d\u201cPuchi!\u201d Lian Ze suddenly could not help but burst out laughing and say, \u201cSister, using it for so many years, didn\u2019t you also survive?\u201dLian Fang Zhou was surprised for a moment, she also started laughing happily. Nodding with a smile, \u201cIs that not right! Silly me! Look at what I am saying!\u201dWhen in Rome, do as the Romans do, she said to herself secretly.\u201cThese two days, we are tired out, tomorrow, let\u2019s rest for one day. The day after tomorrow, you and I will go together to the field to collect sweet potatoes and taro.\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled.Although Lian Ze was also tired, he seemed unwilling to rest, he said: \u201cHow about, tomorrow, sister rests at home; I will go by myself first.\u201d\u201cNo can do!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou flatly refused with a smile. \u201cYou are still young, and right at your growth period, you cannot be overworked. If there\u2019s a chance of harming your body, and it causes some incurable illness, then your life may be destroyed, you can\u2019t do anymore work! \u201dLian Ze listened to her serious tone, she didn\u2019t seem like she was fooling him, so he nodded his head and promised.These two days the news of Lian Fang Zhou and others buying new tiles, repairing and tidying up the roof, was bursting in full swing. Mrs Qiao also knew about it, she felt jealous and was filled with anger, she kept muttering at Lian Li\u2019s side: \u201cWhat is there to be impressive about, have you not seen a person with such a superficial face! She got her hands on some money so she could show off such fanfare as if nobody knows that! Hmph, to have the guts to take out money from dissolving the engagement to go and spend it, is she not afraid of shame! In this life she can\u2019t be married off, that is called embarrassing na!\u201dLian Li listen to her repeated whispering of these words and also couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit upset, he harrumphed: \u201cSaying these things, what\u2019s the use of it? You also are useless, you can\u2019t even deal with a little girl! Yet you still have the courage to speak here!\u201dMrs Qiao knew that what he was talking about was that she wasn\u2019t able to get the money to fall into her hands. It made her feel annoyed and bitter, and cried out in anger: \u201cYou only know how to ill speak of me, what about you, at that time why did you not go then?\u201dLian Li pointed to himself and said: \u201cI go? How could I go! The big uncle snatching things from the hands of his niece, if people knew, how would they talk about me?\u201dMrs Qiao was filled disagreement, Harrumphing. \u201cWhat is there to be afraid of! Behind closed doors who knows what happened? It\u2019s not like those few small radish heads would dare to make an uproar in public? Even if they create an uproar, who would believe little kids words!\u201dMrs Qiao grew more and more regretful, quietly whispering, \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s just that you wouldn\u2019t dare\u2026\u201dShe angrily said: \u201c10 liang na! Really, six months of expenses, even if a few people say something, so what? No, we can\u2019t let them off too lightly! I have to go see!\u201dMrs Qiao went straight to Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s home, not too sour and not cool she said: \u201cYo, you siblings are getting more and more capable, even the house is repaired! Gee, really amazing!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She laughed saying: \u201cI say, Fang Zhou ah, we have to repair the roof of our house; on your way to buy more tiles, let us borrow them to use first. Wait until your uncle is free, and then go to buy them and we will return them back to you!\u201d\u201cYou want to borrow our tiles?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou asked.Mrs Qiao saw that her attitude was very good and did not get angry at all, she was secretly pleased inside. She nodded and said, \u201cYes, of course, it is to borrow, later on, we will definitely return them to you!\u201d\u201cOh, how much do you want?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou asked again.This time Mrs Qiao was so happy that flowers bloomed in her heart, she quickly calculated mentally in her head, and hurriedly laughed saying: \u201cOh, not too much, ah, eight hundred or nine hundred is enough. Oh, no, maybe more than a thousand pieces.\u201dIn her heart she was secretly proud that she could speak so well, saying \u201cmore\u201d than a thousand. As if more or less depended on the situation. If she could get more then get more, what the roof doesn\u2019t need, she can use to cover the pig pen, cattle stalls and more, ah \u2026Lian Fang Zhou then lightly sighed, full of regret she said, \u201cbut Aunt, this is really unfortunate, yesterday the roof of our house had been repaired. The tiles are almost all used up; ah, we were only left with a few sets of ten tiles, if you do not mind, then take it. Otherwise, you will need to wait until the next time we buy, you should come early ah!\u201dMrs Qiao was suddenly stunned; she looked around the yard, and sure enough, the ground was clean. Besides those few sets of ten tiles, was there more?She could not help but get furious, glaring at Lian Fang Zhou she said, \u201cdead brat, you are messing with me!\u201d\u201cAunt, I\u2019m being accused wrongly, ah!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou laughed and said: \u201cYou asked and I answered. How did it become me fooling you?\u201d Suddenly her face darkened, with eyes like ice she stared at Mrs Qiao, coldly saying, \u201cYour house was newly built last year, but you ran up to me asking for thousands of tiles, I think you are the one messing with me?\u201dMrs Qiao was suddenly dumbfounded, snorting she said, \u201cWhat \u2018want\u2019? It is borrow! Just borrowing! If you aren\u2019t willing to give them, you say so much nonsense!\u201d\u201cOhhh -\u201d Lian Fang Zhou dragged the \u2018oh\u2019 sounding full of ridicule. \u201cSo it was \u2018borrow\u2019 ah, I don\u2019t know if borrow and want have any distinction in Aunt\u2019s eyes, personally I think there\u2019s none!\u201dMrs Qiao was angered until she wanted to collapse, her nose almost breathed out smoke. Since she born from her mother\u2019s womb, she had never been this angry!Especially in the past, it was just her bullying the Second Branch; now she was bullied by a family that was left with a nest of small bastards, this imbalance was terrible. So today\u2019s share of anger was more intense.\u201cYou should be proud then!\u201d Mrs Qiao sneered, \u201chaving dissolved your engagement sure is good, what is there to be proud of! I believe, in this lifetime you shouldn\u2019t even think of being able to marry off!\u201d\u201cAunt, please leave!\u201d Lian Ze furiously rushed up.\u201cAh Ze,\u201d Lian Fang Zhou held him. Towards Mrs Qiao she faintly smiled and said: \u201cThe things you said, I do not care! I marrying off or not is not for you to have a say in! Isn\u2019t it just finding a man? Really easy! In this world, two-legged toads aren\u2019t easy to find, but two-legged men there are plentiful of!\u201d\u201cYou, you -\u201d Mrs Qiao\u2019s eyes opened wide, her leg stomped with an \u201cOh\u201d sound. \u201cYou are really, really shameless!\u201dLian Fang Zhou also ignored the stunned Lian Ze and chuckled with a meaningful look toward Mrs Qiao. Watching intently, she smiled. \u201cAunt, ah, why are you blushing? You already gave birth to a baby; are you still thinking that you\u2019re a young girl, na. Shy, ah? Or say, you also want to find a man? I advise you to save it, with you like this, even giving money there\u2019s no man willing to want you!\u201d\u201cYou, you!\u201d Mrs Qiao felt a burst of dizziness, she felt like she was seeing stars in front of her. She was angered until she almost fainted and her was heart going crazy until she didn\u2019t know what to do!\u201cWhat you, you?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou harrumphed: \u201cI\u2019m telling you, ah. Oh, and quickly bring a thousand catties of grain back to us, otherwise, hmph! My mother said she will definitely go find you!\u201d\u201cYou are dreaming!\u201d Mrs Qiao\u2019s breath finally returned to normal, she bitterly spat at the ground; with a red and greenish pale white face she ran out fleeing.Lian Fang Zhou felt it was interesting and couldn\u2019t mask her laughing as she bent over.She heard a faint \u201cSister\u201d reaching her ears. Lian Fang Zhou froze and secretly breathed out \u201cDamn!\u201d She only remembered beside her there was also Lian Ze.She looked up at him, Lian Ze\u2019s face had a suspicious flush. He was both embarrassed and awkward, he was also angry and sad.\u201cSister how can you, how can \u2014\u201d Lian Ze was so depressed that he couldn\u2019t say it.\u201cHow can I say those words, right?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou continued, facing his eyes she gently sighed. Softly she said, \u201cAh Ze, Sister was only saying it; I just want to scare Aunt! What kind of person Sister is, don\u2019t you already know? Sister was just using her mouth to talk about it. Could it be, that you look down on your Sister?\u201d\u201cNo, no!\u201d Lian Ze repeatedly shook his head. \u201cHow can I look down on my sister! I also know my sister said it only to anger Aunt, but in case Aunt talks about it to the public, would that not be bad for sister\u2019s reputation?\u201dLian Fang Zhou chuckled, smiling as she said: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, those words, how can she say it out loud to someone else? Will people believe that I, an unmarried girl would say that kind of thing? Did Sister ever say those kinds of words before? Since that\u2019s the case, even if she talks about it, who would believe it!\u201dThinking of Mrs Qiao\u2019s awkward state, Lian Fang Zhou could not help but burst out laughing, \u201chehehe\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Lian Ze for a moment was speechless.\u201cAlright,\u201d Lian Fang Zhou gently patted his shoulder; softly smiling; \u201cSister will promise you, from now on I won\u2019t say these kinds of words!\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d Lian Ze nodded, then his face showed a bit of a smile.Mrs Qiao escaped from Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s home, she still felt flush and her heart was beating irregularly. Not until she returned to her own home, did she breathe out a long sigh of relief.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d Asked Lian Li, looking strangely at her.\u201cI -\u201d Mrs Qiao was startled, she started stuttering, \u201cno, nothing, nothing is wrong!\u201dAlthough she and Lian Li have been a couple for several decades, but these words she can\u2019t say it, it is simply embarrassing to death!\u201cNothing wrong? If nothing is wrong then why do you look like you have seen a ghost!\u201d Lian Li stared at her with dissatisfaction.Mrs Qiao internally thought, It is scarier than seeing a ghost! Lian Fang Zhou that girl, eight out of ten a ghost has possessed her body, or else she is completely crazy; how else could a young girl say these kinds words.\u201cThat Lian Fang Zhou is really going too far, hmph, I just asked to borrow some tiles from her; she even teased me!\u201dMrs Qiao coughed and changed the topic, angrily she spoke with Lian Li about what happened.When Lian Li heard it he also felt angry. \u201cThis is really outrageous! This girl is really lawless! If she doesn\u2019t want to give then just simply say no, but to actually talk like this! And You, we just changed the roof of the house and yet you still said all that. isn\u2019t this simply asking to be ridiculed? My face, you completely lost it! You have embarrassed me! What are you standing for? Hurry up and go cook!\u201dMrs Qiao snorted, \u201cif You\u2019re that capable, then why don\u2019t you go find her and get even? Really!\u201d She went to the kitchen to wash the rice pot and no longer mentioned it.She placed the pot on the rack, then went to the yard to feed the chickens and close the pen.When she saw those chickens, she suddenly froze for a moment, then \u201cahhh!\u201d as she screamed, \u201chusband, quickly come, come and see!\u201d\u201cWhat are you howling like a ghost for!\u201d Inside the house, Lian Li was startled and was scared by her scream, angrily he stormed out of the house.\u201cYou look, you look!\u201d Mrs Qiao did not bother with what he said and pointed at the chickens in the yard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Chapter 15 Maybe my mother came back to find youTranslated by Maggie Edited by SimpleLian Li followed where her fingers were pointing at and looked; he was also shocked, he saw all twenty large and small chickens listlessly drooping their heads. They were either standing up or lying on the ground with a sluggish dull appearance.\u201cWhat, what is happening!\u201d Lian Li\u2019s face also changed.\u201cWhich heinous criminal has done this!\u201d Mrs. Qiao\u2019s heart hurt so much that she slapped her thigh and cried out.These chickens clearly looked like they got sick; and from looks of it, it looks like they can\u2019t get better! Apart from these twenty large and small chickens, there are ten fist sized chicks that are still growing; as well as a hen that just laid an egg.If they all died, would it not make the couple also die from heartache?Lian Li hasn\u2019t spoken a single word.\u201cAh!\u201d Mrs. Qiao suddenly cried out and ground her teeth hard. \u201cI know, it must be Lian Fang Zhou, it must be that dead girl\u2019s doing, it must be her! I, I\u2019ll go find her!\u201d\u201cHold on, you wait a moment!\u201d Lian Li called to stop her, puzzled as he asked,\u201dhow do you know it\u2019s that girl\u2019s doing? Don\u2019t go causing trouble again, that girl is now different from the past, she\u2019s not a good crop!\u201d\u201cI, I just know it!\u201d Mrs. Qiao stomped, Under Lian Li\u2019s interrogating eyes did she finally say, \u201cI, I was angry at that dead girl\u2019s actions, so these days I would deliberately put our chickens into their home garden \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are really -\u201d Lian Li\u2019s anger suddenly spiked, he stare at her and snapped. \u201cYou only know how to do these bits and pieces of stupid things; what\u2019s the use! Her garden in this season, what is left in there? What\u2019s the point of putting the chickens there?\u201dMrs. Qiao suddenly felt there was no meaning, and dejectedly said, \u201cI was just angry! Oh let\u2019s not talk about this, I\u2019ll go and find her!\u201dMrs. Qiao said and speedily ran over toward Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s home.When she arrived, Lian Fang Zhou and her siblings were also making dinner.Not waiting for them to speak, Mrs. Qiao found Lian Fang Zhou and straightforwardly asked, \u201cmy family\u2019s chickens, did you drug them?\u201dLian Fang Zhou was stunned, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re still pretending!\u201d Mrs. Qiao spat out; harrumphed and said, \u201cmy family\u2019s chickens are all sick and listless like they\u2019re half-dead, certainly it\u2019s your doing!\u201d\u201cAunt, when you speak don\u2019t you need to give evidence? did you personally see it? If you did personally see it, would you have allowed me to do that? If you didn\u2019t see it, on what basis are you saying this? So if in the future there\u2019s something wrong with my family\u2019s chickens, I will also go find you, ah?\u201dLian Fang Zhou sneered back.Suddenly Mrs. Qiao bitterly couldn\u2019t say anything, she stared at her for a moment then sneered.\u201dYou must have used sleight of hand! Your garden wasn\u2019t fenced properly, knowing my family\u2019s chickens would go there; you must have held a grudge! Lian Fang Zhou, you must compensate me for my chickens!\u201dTwenty-something chickens, what if they all died \u2026\u2026Thinking about this made Mrs. Qiao\u2019s heartbleed.Lian Fang Zhou glanced at her, and mentally had a bit of admiration; obviously, she was wrong at first, and she found someone else afterward to get even. She can still say it so righteously, this is using specious arguments ah, it is clearly using great intelligence, ah!\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou deliberately smiled. \u201cSo uncle and Aunt\u2019s chickens entered our family\u2019s garden ah? I didn\u2019t know! Since Aunt saw them why did you not tell me? Aunt\u2019s heart really is \u2013 Gee! \u201dSuddenly Mrs. Qiao\u2019s face heated, and she immediately straightened her spine. \u201cSo you admit it? You admit that you had a grudge! Dead girl, hurry up and compensate me!\u201dThinking of those ten liang, she immediately said, \u201ccompensate with money!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know such a thing had happened, Aunt don\u2019t pester incessantly, OK?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou said lightly, and asked her siblings, \u201cDid you do it?\u201dThe three of them shook their heads. Lian Fang Qing also added, \u201cI also didn\u2019t know, if I did know, I would have shooed them out a long time ago. Not allowing them to bite my family\u2019s plants!\u201dMrs. Qiao ignored her, and sneered; 'stop giving me specious arguments! If it wasn\u2019t you, who else would it be? What did you do!\u201d\u201cI do not know what you are talking about!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou sneered. \u201cYou said your family\u2019s chickens are half dead, I do not know what medicine can have this effect? Aunt thinks I know? And also, these days I was at home and didn\u2019t go out. Where would I get some kind of medicine? If you do not believe me, you can search our home; if you can find some kind of medicine I will compensate you for your family\u2019s chickens! If you can not find any, we\u2019ll go to the chief\u2019s house for judgment! Aunt, do you dare?\u201dOriginally hearing Liang Fang Zhou say that she would let her search the house, Mrs. Qiao\u2019s eyes lit up. She really wanted to take advantage and fish in troubled waters, but hearing what she said at the end, she became frustrated.She could not help but hesitate, not because she believed Lian Fang Zhou, but because she actually does not believe that Lian Fang Zhou has such a skill.\u201cAunt, instead of coming here and wronging us siblings, you might as well go back and quickly think of a way; perhaps,\u201d Lian Fang Zhou glanced at her, and faintly said, \u201cmy mother has done it\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou stop scaring this old woman!\u201d Mrs. Qiao was startled, and her face could not help but become white.Right at this moment, a night wind blew by, chilling people. Mrs. Qiao only felt chills on her spine, and subconsciously took two steps back, clutching her chest.Lian Fang Zhou was calm and gave her an indifferent glance, saying nothing. It was a look that meant: You think of what to do yourself.\u201cYou stop scaring this old woman!\u201d Mrs. Qiao could not help but say, her voice was slightly trembling; and did not sound as strong as last time.Lian Fang Zhou still did not speak, she just looked at her look indifferently.\u201cHmph!\u201d Mrs. Qiao could not hold it in, She really wanted to curse at Lian Fang Zhou. She even stepped forward to grab her and hit her, but her heart was pounding as it beat, and could not move even half step. Her throat seemed to be blocked by something, and not even a word would come out.Gradually, she felt her chest muffled as if something was approaching from all directions. Gradually it shrunk, and got even more tightening; she tightly squeezed her hands and almost couldn\u2019t breathe.Could it be that sister-in-law really came back \u2026\u2026Mrs. Qiao\u2019s mind went \u201cboom\u201d as it exploded, and she could no longer stand it, she gently spat toward the ground, leaving an \u201cI\u2019ll come back and get even with you later on.\u201d She turned and hurriedly ran away. She was weak for a moment, and also almost fell.\u201cHow was it? Did you ask and get anything out of it?\u201d When Mrs. Qiao returned home, Lian Li could not help but ask with concern.Twenty chickens, ah, it could sell for a lot of money na!\u201cNo, nothing!\u201d Mrs. Qiao\u2019s face wasn\u2019t very good and was full of panic.\u201cReally useless!\u201d Lian Li could not help but feel a burst of disappointment.\u201cHusband,\u201d Mrs. Qiao after a long while regained her wits; her heartbeat gradually returned to normal. She could not help but ask, \u201cYou say, could it be that sister-in-law is blaming us for taking her family\u2019s food, so -\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense are you saying!\u201d Li Lian was so angry that he almost jumped up, he pointed at her and yelled, \u201cI see you pointlessly lived for half your life! Ignorant! Stupid! Did that girl use these words to fool you? You actually believed it! Hmph! Really useless! \u201dMrs. Qiao\u2019s face burst into shades of red and white, and quietly whispered,\u201dI do not know; I, my heart felt unsettled \u2026\u2026\u201dLian Li sneered, \u201cFrom what I see, eighty percent is that girl\u2019s doing!\u201d\u201cHow can she have such a skill? If you said these chickens were drugged by her and died, I would believe, but, but this appearance \u2013 what medicine can this be ah? These days I have not seen her go anywhere to get medicine\u2026\u2026 \u201d Mrs. Qiao\u2019s voice was vague and low.Lian Li slightly froze, then sneered. \u201cIf it really is sister-in-law, why would she only touch a few of our chickens?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Mrs. Qiao\u2019s eyes lit up, her mind was certain. She couldn\u2019t help but angrily say, \u201cthat dead girl, a mouthful of nonsense, I was almost tricked by her! But what is actually wrong with these chickens ..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Chapter 16 Finally took back the grainTranslated by Maggie Edited by SimpleMrs. Qiao sighed for the chickens. She was anxious at night did not sleep well, the next day she got up and immediately went to the chicken cages to have a look.Once she looked, she felt disappointed. Those chickens are still same as yesterday; there is no sign of the slightest improvement.This isn\u2019t much. When Mrs. Qiao also found the two large pigs in the pigsty and the cattle in the barn also drooping and listless, she screamed and almost fell to the ground. She suddenly turned and shouted \u201cHusband! Husband!\u201d and ran to go to the house.After personally seeing it, Lian Li was stunned; murmuring, \u201cabnormal, really abnormal!\u201d\u201cWhat abnormal! It doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d Mrs. Qiao cried with distress, \u201cit\u2019s definitely Sister-in-law, it must be her! We must give those grains back to those siblings, or else, Sister-in-law might look for us!\u201dLian Li\u2019s face burst with dismay, and his color sank. He murmured, \u201ca thousand catties of grain \u2026\u2026\u201dMrs. Qiao hearing this also felt heartache, but \u2013\u201cHusband,\u201d she said, with great sadness: \u201cOur family\u2019s big cattle and two pigs and so many chickens are worth more than those grains! We cannot just watch the cows and pigs die. This pig was fed for almost a year, and with no cattle, what are we going to do next spring!\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Lian Li grit his teeth. \u201cGive the grain back to them! Go, let\u2019s go to their house!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Mrs. Qiao nodded.Their original thinking was gaining a thousand pounds of grain for nothing. The couple was happy to death; for those few days when she was walking her body felt much lighter like her whole person was floating in the clouds.Well, it\u2019s great, not a piece was gotten but instead they actually helped others harvest for free\u2026\u2026Lian Li and Mrs. Qiao came to Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s home, and he carefully said what was the purpose of the visit. What Lian Ze wanted to say was stopped by Lian Fang Zhou.Lian Fang Zhou sighed, 'so my Mother really went to find you, So it was true ah\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOh Niece, at this moment don\u2019t mention that. Quickly save our family\u2019s cattle, pigs, and chickens; ah, if it\u2019s delayed I am afraid it would be too late! You be rest assured, we will certainly give the grains back, definitely!\u201d Mrs. Qiao was anxious.Because in limbo, how can they not give?\u201cUncle, Aunt,\u201d Lian Fang Zhou wasn\u2019t hurried. She helplessly spread out her hands and said, \u201cthis matter you have begged me for, I have no idea, how can I know how to treat it ah!\u201dLian Li and Mrs. Qiao both froze and looked at each other.That\u2019s right, this isn\u2019t Fang Zhou\u2019s doing, how would she know what to do?They are completely stupid.At this time Lian Ze coldly interrupted, \u201cUncle, Aunt, if you are reallysincere, it is better to give my mother a stick of incense!\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right! light incense, incense! Of course, we have sincerity, isn\u2019t that right, ah, Husband!\u201d Mrs. Qiao willing grabbed the life-saving straw and hurriedly pulled Lian Li to go pray in the partitioned area for Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s parents\u2019 to light incense.Mrs. Qiao also did not forget to verbally read the prayer and begged her Sister-in-law to let go of their family\u2019s pig, cattle, and chickens. She said a lot of good words when it came time to end the prayer, she even actually asked her to bless her\u2026Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze hearing this was speechless.\u201cOh, no reaction ah!\u201d After Mrs. Qiao put away the incense, she looked at their mother\u2019s offering plate and was extremely eager.\u201cAunt, right now it\u2019s daytime!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou said, \u201cyou should go back first, with this matter you\u2019ll have to wait until tomorrow.\u201d\u201cHow could that be fine! What if my cattle die, what am I to do!\u201d Mrs. Qiao felt impatient.Lian Fang Zhou sneered, \u201cAunt If you knew that early, why would you do that from the start! Rest assured, my mother is not a cruel person!\u201dMrs. Qiao was stunned again.\u201cRight, right, go, we will go back first!\u201d Lian Li also spoke.\u201cReally? What if -\u201d Mrs. Qiao was still not willing, she looked helplessly at Lian Fang Zhou, as if waiting for her guarantee.Lian Fang Zhou said that this matter only her mother would know. Her eyes showed she had no answers.Mrs. Qiao, helpless, had to go back.That whole day the couple did not give up, they looked left and right in the animal pen, looking forward to a miracle. But in the end was disappointed. They could only persistently endure and be patient until the next day.Early the next morning, Mrs. Qiao with an unkempt appearance came to Lian Fang Zhou \u2018s house.Lian Fang Zhou was in front of the stove burning the fire when she saw her. She didn\u2019t wait for her to ask and said, \u201cmy Mother talked to me in my dream last night; my Mother said, if Uncle and Aunt are determined to change, she will forgive you this time! Go pack some incense ash from the incense pot to bring back! Use the incense ash when filling the water for the animals to drink; wait at least half a day and it will get better!\u201d\u201cReally? That\u2019s great!\u201d Mrs. Qiao\u2019s excitement shone on her face.\u201cGrains?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou stopped her and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to get it now!\u201dMrs. Qiao\u2019s whole heart was on the cattle, pigs, and chickens. Why would she bother with her? She nodded. But suddenly she stopped again and said, \u201cwhat if\u2026 It does not work?\u201dLian Fang Zhou sneered and said nothing.\u201cJust pretend I didn\u2019t say that, pretend I didn\u2019t say that!\u201d Mrs. Qiao suddenly remembered that these words were disrespectful, and could not help but gently slap her mouth twice before quickly saying.Lian Fang Zhou called out to Lian Ze. \u201cGet the baskets and sacks, we\u2019re going to get some grains! Fang\u2019er, Che\u2019er, you two go to the stove and watch the fire. Wait for us come back to move the grains!\u201dLian Fang Qing and Lian Che quickly agreed.Mrs. Qiao packed two packets of ash, wanting to leave quickly. Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze also followed behind to move the grain.Lian Li borrowed a large scale and watched at the side carefully. Seeing the two siblings each carrying one basket at a time out, one sack at a time, caused his heart so much aching it was almost dripping blood.Time, little by little, went by. He finally couldn\u2019t bear it anymore, and was about to speak out to refuse; just as he heard the excited screaming of Mrs. Qiao in the yard. \u201cHusband, Husband! Amazing, really amazing! They\u2019re already better, much better, ah! The cow, pigs, and the chickens all have vigor, and they are starting to eat!\u201dMrs. Qiao was jolting with happiness, and hurriedly fed the cattle with the best forage. Not like before when she was afraid it would eat too much.Lian Li was surprised and happy; those words of refusal couldn\u2019t come out anymore. He really believed it, and was really afraid! How would he still dare refuse?Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze, the two even carried away the scales. They were busy for a whole half day before they got back the catties of grain upstairs in the storage.Although the siblings felt their bodies being tired, when they looked at the sacks filled with grains, their spirits were very happy.Lian Ze could not help but grip some rice in his hand, full of grain; and placed it under his nose to smell. The fragrance of rice made people\u2019s hearts pragmatic.\u201cSister, you are so great! Now we do not have to go hungry! economize how we eat, and we will be able to sustain until next year\u2019s harvest! This way Fang\u2019er and Che\u2019er can eat a little more and feel full!\u201d Lian Ze\u2019s face shone with joy.\u201cYes, no matter what you need to eat until you\u2019re full, or elsewhere will you get the strength to work? Not only eat eating until you\u2019re full but to also eat well. Sister will find a way and will not let you suffer!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou is also very happy.The so-called mother manifestation, of course, is false. The fact is, she got a few herbs mixed together into juice and mixed it with some rice and secretly sprinkled it in the garden for Aunt\u2019s chicken to eat. The next night with Lian Ze she quietly snuck into her Aunt\u2019s home to let the pigs and cattle eat it as well.It is not a deadly poison, it just causes some intestinal gas and loss of appetite.This is from her past life when she went to visit the ranch, she learned about it. Coincidentally, this kind of grass is common.\u201cSister, I, I would like to discuss something with you.\u201d Lian Ze suddenly and hesitantly said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFinally get to eat rice againTranslated by Maggie Edited by SimpleLian Fang Zhou smiled and said, \u201cwe have nothing that can\u2019t be discussed between us siblings? Look at you acting nervous! Tell me!\u201dLian Ze\u2019s eyes darkened while whispering, \u201cwhen father and mother were still here, they said, wait until next spring; then we will let Che\u2019er go to the village school to study \u2026\u2026\u201dSeeing that Lian Fang Zhou had frozen for a second, Lian Ze hurriedly said, \u201cwe repaired the beams, and we have money food! Sister, I can eat less! Let Che\u2019er go study, is that OK?\u201d\u201cWhat OK!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou put some strength in her finger and poked his forehead. \u201cYou just reminded me, Che\u2019er is still small so it is a good time to study; I will let him go! You just needed to say it. Why are you acting like this? And never say something like eating less!\u201d\u201cAre you taking your sister as an outsider? Is Che\u2019er not my family too? Am I not looking out for his best interest as well?\u201dLian Fang Zhou slightly sneered and her heart really felt a little bit disappointed and sad. With her doing so much for this house, doing her best to support the family, in the end, is she just a wishful thinker?They don\u2019t even think of her as family!\u201cSister, Sister!\u201d Lian Ze saw that she was really angry and could not help but feel guilty. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sister, I was wrong, I was really wrong! I, I do not know how \u2013 it\u2019s my bad! Sister, do not be angry, alright? I will never again \u2026\u2026 \u201dLian Ze was anxious as well as ashamed and was incoherently explaining as he tried to apologize. But he found that he couldn\u2019t even explain it clearly!He did not know what was wrong with himself to subconsciously say that! It was if that in front of his sister, she was no longer his sister?He really was an idiot! Damn! How could he have thought such a thing? If Sister is not Sister, then could it be she was a stranger?Would strangers be so good to them? Would they bother with their lives like she does?Even if Sister is not the same as before, isn\u2019t it just that she is changing herself for them!\u201cAlright,\u201d Lian Fang Zhou sighed softly and said, \u201cyou have to remember, I am your sister; we will always be a family! Understand?\u201dLian Fang Zhou secretly thought in her heart, no wonder he felt something was not right. These days with her changing so much from how the original Lian Fang Zhou was, the change may be too big. He found it difficult to accept and his instinctive reaction was inevitable.\u201cYes!\u201d Lian Ze ashamed nodded repeatedly; vowing: \u201cI remember, I will always remember! I will never doubt my sister, never again! No matter how much Sister changes, you will still be our sister. You always will be!\u201d\u201cThen all is well!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou happily laughed in a light-hearted tone. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go, go downstairs! Tonight we\u2019ll have a good meal with white rice. I will make you fried eggs to eat!\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d Lian Ze smiled with embarrassment, this time he didn\u2019t say he would eat less.During dinner time, Lian Fang Zhou sure enough cooked a pot of real white rice and chopped a bundle of leeks. She beat three eggs and fried them together making fragrant leek eggs.While frying them together they made a 'splash\u201d as Lian Fang Zhou poured the mixture of leeks and eggs into the pot. Suddenly, the pot was boiling and made a \u201czzzz\u201d noise; the rich aroma reached the nose and made the room full of delicious smells.Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che smelled the aroma and could not help but continuously gulp. Their eyes kept staring at the pot, taking really deep breaths through their noses; they were beaming with joy and laughingly yelled words like, \u201cSmells delicious, ah! Really delicious!.\u201d \u201cIt will definitely taste good!\u201d And so on. The small kitchen erupted with laughter.Flaming hot fire filled the room full of warmth. Watching the pair of younger siblings laughing happily, Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s heart was filled warmth and it softened. She secretly decided: We must live a good life! Not seeking lots of wealth and luxuries, but to not need to ever worry about food and clothing.This time at dinner, the four siblings all ate very happily. Fried leek and eggs, a bowl of fried sweet potato cubes, a bowl of stew winter melon that Aunt Zhang\u2019s family gave them, and also a bowl of leek soup.A few simple dishes, but it warmed the stomach and the heart.The next day, Lian Fang Zhou intended to make the vegetable garden fence firm. And prepared it to be sprinkled with rapeseed.She and Lian Ze brought Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che up to the mountains. Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che helped pick up the branches of the forest, and the two of them used a machete to cut wild wattle trees and found some vines. Then they went back to reinforce the gardens enclosure wall so that even a newly born chick couldn\u2019t even think about entering again.Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che were very hard working. Especially Lian Fang Qing, like a lively rabbit running around in the woods. She was giggling as she chattered and laughed, causing Lian Fang Zhou from time to time to loudly yell \u201cdon\u2019t go too far!\u201d And then Lian Che in a childish tone with a very childish air would reply, \u201cSister, no need to worry, I\u2019m watching her!\u201d While Lian Fang Qing would protest with dissatisfaction\u2026\u2026For a time, the woods weren\u2019t noisy.Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che would pick up the finger size branches and make a pile. They were neatly stacked so that the elder brother and sister could easily tie a cane and carry them home.There\u2019s a lot of foliage in the woods, and soon they gathered two big piles. But they still continued to gather more.Lian Fang Zhou took pity on their young ages and originally she wanted to say stop but was afraid they would both have nothing do and will run around. What if an accident happened, obviously that wouldn\u2019t be good. So, it would be better to continue letting them work.If the fence doesn\u2019t use up all these twigs and branches, it can also be kept for the fire when they need to keep it burning.\u201cWaa! Sister, Sister! There are mushrooms here, there are mushrooms!\u201d Lian Fang Qing suddenly exclaimed with excitement like she had found a new world, \u201cSister, Second Brother, Third Brother, quickly come and see ah!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t carelessly move!\u201d Lian Ze without waiting to go over first yelled over in a loud voice. His voice carried panic, \u201cdon\u2019t mess with the mushrooms and be careful of poison!\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d Lian Fang Qing pouted her mouth, somewhat unhappy and replied back. But she still obediently took back her hand that was about to pick it. She raised her face, a pair of black sparkling eyes helplessly looked at Lian Fang Zhou, \u201cSister, these mushrooms, they can be eaten right?\u201dLian Fang Zhou looked at the grass and saw dozens of mushrooms; some were big and some were about the size of an egg. The small ones were the size of coins or smaller; they were oval and had pale brown skin. Nearby, some had burst open and the inside looked as if was wrapping a bag of ash. The ground at the side also had some mushrooms stuck to it.Lian Fang Zhou smiled and said, \u201cthis kind of mushroom is called ash-bag, it is edible. Our Qing\u2019er is very capable.\u201d\u201cOh! Tonight we will have mushrooms! Tonight we will have mushrooms!\u201d Lian Fang Qing started to clap her little hands and Immediately called Lian Che to crouch down and pick them.\u201cThe inside is gray \u2026.. How can it be edible?\u201d Lian Ze was still concerned as he said, \u201cSister, it is better to be careful! What if something happened? Last year in Xia Jiang village, there was a family being gluttonous and mistakenly ate poisonous mushrooms as food and died. Also, in our village, it was because of wild mushrooms that some people vomited and had a fever \u2026\u2026 \u201dWhen Lian Fang Qing heard this, the hand which was about to pick them up paused; but very quickly continued picking. She pouted and said, \u201cSister said it is edible, so then it is edible! Second Brother is always trying to scare people!\u201dLian Fang Zhou smiled as she said, \u201cAh Ze, don\u2019t worry, this mushroom is indeed edible. If I was not sure, I would not say it was! Qing\u2019er, your second brother isn\u2019t scaring you. In this world, there\u2019s no less than a thousand kind of mushrooms. The edible, tasty, and not bad one are only in the dozens! So if in the future you see them, you cannot reckless gather or pick them. More importantly, do not recklessly eat them and you must ask sister, understood?\u201dLian Fang Qing has already thought of her as her backbone and head of the family. So what she said is always right. Immediately she spoke out, \u201cunderstood, Sister. I will listen to Sister! Sister, we will continue to find some more mushrooms, is that alright?\u201dLian Fang Zhou could see that she was still a child, in the end, she nodded and said, \u201cthen you and Che\u2019er will search in this area! But be careful, and don\u2019t go stepping on the ants\u2019 nests! Also, these grass leaves are sharp and some places also have long thorns. you have to be careful!\u201d\u201cUnderstood Sister!\u201d Lian Fang Qing happily agreed, calling Lian Che to go with her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

For the others, nobody else seems to dare pick them.\u201dLian Fang Zhou\u2019s heart could not help but be moved and said, \u201cWell then, there must be a lot of wild mushrooms in the forest? We need to pick a lot and, besides being used for us to eat, we also could sell them for a lot of money!\u201dThis is the ancient era ah, the forest is vast, with lush vegetation; it is a paradise for the growth of a variety of wild mushroom. And it\u2019s not like she couldn\u2019t recognize the good stuff, how could she know that there is a treasure on the mountain and not look for it? What kind of logic is that?Lian Ze\u2019s eyes also brightened and blurted out, \u201d talking about mushrooms, there are a lot in Mount Xian Teng!\u201dLian Fang Zhou eyes also lit up, flashing a smile; \u201cin that case, let\u2019s go to Mount Xian Teng!\u201d\u201cNo, we can\u2019t!\u201d Lian Ze looked annoyed as if he said something that should not be said. He quickly said, \u201cMount Xian Teng is the biggest forest in this area, it is more than 20 miles from the village. I heard that the trees are really really tall and the whole sky is covered. In those woods, there\u2019s a variety of beasts that come and go. no one wants to go there!\u201dLian Fang Zhou was already moved by what he said, so how could she so easily give up? She then smiled, \u201cdo not try to coax me anymore! You\u2019re not someone who would lie! And also, if no one one goes, how would you know so much about it?\u201dLian Ze didn\u2019t stop and could only honestly say, \u201cat the village\u2019s edge, hunter Sun Zhang Xing, Uncle Sun would go. According to him he only wanders around the edge of the forest and hunts a number of small animals like hares, pheasants, roe deer and mountain goats. He doesn\u2019t dare to go deep into the forest. Also, his family are foreigners and their household is from outside, they are not from the village. So, there are no fields to farm, in order to make a living he has no choice but to go.\u201dLian Fang Zhou nodded, 'so it\u2019s like that! Since it\u2019s the edge of the forest, there\u2019s no problem if we go? Wait until we go back then we will find him. We will ask him to let us go with him the next time he goes hunting.\u201d\u201cSister \u2026..\u201d Lian Ze was extremely regretful; he really shouldn\u2019t be so fast to speak impulsively.Lian Fang Zhou faintly smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t be like that. Let\u2019s go and see first. if it is really dangerous, next time we won\u2019t go, alright?\u201dThere\u2019s such a place, not going to take a look around at least once, how could she feel at ease?Lian Ze knew he couldn\u2019t persuade her, so he could only agree.After being busy working for a long time, finally the things that needed to be chopped were done and ready. The four siblings were all exhausted and sat on the grass to rest.Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t far from the village here. But they are still small and don\u2019t have much strength. To carry all these things back home, they might have to spend half a day.Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che have already picked a large number of ash-bag mushrooms. Lian Fang Qing had already removed her own floral coat she wears when outside and used it to wrap and collect the ash-bag mushrooms. Like offering a treasure, she let Lian Fang Zhou see.Lian Fang Zhou saw it and praised her several times. Making her extremely happy.After resting for a while, the siblings prepared to go home.Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze each carried 10-11 kg bundles of tied tree pieces. Lian Fang Qing held the mushrooms wrapped in her jacket; while Lian Che insisted he needed to help, so he carried 4kg of tree pieces.The four siblings went back to their home.When reaching the edge of the village, someone rather abruptly called out \u201cFang Zhou!\u201dDue to a moment of unawareness, Lian Fang Zhou was startled. She was already exhausted to the point of feeling comfortable, the shock caused her foot slip on a stone. She staggered a few steps forward, those long pieces of wood immediately started to become imbalanced and shake, making Lian Fang Zhou involuntarily wobble.\u201cSister!\u201d\u201cAh, Sister!\u201d\u201cBe careful!\u201dA few voices sounded at the same time. Lian Fang Zhou felt that someone firmlyheld the tree pieces behind her and said, \u201cFang Zhou, let me!\u201dLian Fang Zhou turned her head and saw who it was, she could not help but freeze. It was no stranger, it was actually her former fiance Yang Huai Shan.\u201cNo need! I can do it myself!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s face suddenly sank and shook her shoulders to indicate him to let go of her. She said, \u201calso, I\u2019m not so familiar with you. Do not call my name, call me Miss Lian!\u201dYang Huai Shan face suddenly had a guilty and painful look. \u201cFang Zhou \u2013 Mi, Miss Lian, why must you be so unfeeling? I just want to help you.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Lian Fang Zhou shook her head.\u201cAh! What are you doing?!\u201d Yang Huai Shan\u2019s mother, old woman Yang was jogging from behind to catch up. Slightly breathless, she pulled Yang Huai Shan behind her to shield him. Toward Lian Fang Zhou, she sneered, \u201cdon\u2019t you have any shame? Haven\u2019t we the Yang Family given you ten Liang for dissolving the engagement? Why do you still pester my son, not wanting to let go!\u201dShe can\u2019t walk away now, if this matter isn\u2019t cleared, she won\u2019t be able to live peacefully.She wants to be in this village and to continue carrying on living this life; she is not willing to be isolated or even marginalized by people. She is not afraid of being looked down upon by others for having her engagement dissolved. But her reputation must not be compromised.All of a sudden, Lian Fang Zhou put the bundles of tree pieces on her shoulders down. Lian Ze was also steaming with anger and was about to open his mouth, but someone was faster than him.\u201cMother, you misunderstand! Fang Zhou \u2013 Miss Lian did not pester me. It was me, I wanted to help her a bit\u2026\u2026\u201d Yang Huai Shan quietly said.\u201cYou shut up!\u201d Old woman Yang did not expect her that her son would demolish her stance in front of her face like this.\u201cYou hear that clearly?\u201d Lian Ze stepped in front of Lian Fang Zhou. He was still not as tall as Lian Fang Zhou, but he raised his head and staring unrelentingly at old woman Yang. \u201cControl your son, so he doesn\u2019t hassle my sister!\u201d\u201cBad people! You all are bad people!\u201d Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che also came up, glaring at them.Old woman Yang was angered until she froze. \u201cHuff\u201d taking a deep breath sneered, \u201creally, you have been raised by a mother, but wasn\u2019t taught very well by a mother. These nest of bastards are rogue-like and are very tough goods!\u201d\u201cWhat did you say! Try saying that again!\u201d Lian Ze\u2019s face changed and the veins on his forehead throbbed, his aura startled everyone.Old woman Yang was scared by him, and she could not help but take a step back. Yang Huai Shan was also anxious, he hurried to shield the old woman Yang behind him. Softly he said, \u201clet\u2019s all talk nicely \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say to you!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou was coldly staring at the mother and son. Toward Old Woman Yang she sneered, \u201cI told you long ago, you better manage your son well and don\u2019t come back to pester me! But right now how it seems, he has a mother to teach, she is not much better ah, shameless! Rascal! If you dare to pester me again, don\u2019t blame this great one for being rude! Old Woman Yang, when you\u2019re free, teach him some more!\u201d\u201cYou, you!\u201d Old woman Yang was so angered that she want to hop up and down. \u201cA good sharp-tongued stinky brat you are, thank god the engagement was dissolved, or else I really would be out of luck for eight lifetimes!\u201dYang Huai Shan\u2019s face also exposed a painful look and was depressed as he sighed, \u201cFang \u2013 Miss Lian, don\u2019t speak like that OK\u2026 \u2026\u201dLian Fang Zhou did not pay attention to him, still facing the Old Woman Yang and sneered, \u201cthis is what I should say, God really has eyes, he rescued me out of the fire pit! Otherwise, ah, in the future, those days I really wouldn\u2019t want to continue living in it! \u201d\u201cHuai Shan, listen, listen, what kind of words are those!\u201d Old Woman Yang angrily pulled Huai Shan aside to push him towards Lian Fang Zhou. \u201cYou let her bully your mother in front of you? And you\u2019re still not teaching her a lesson for me?!\u201d\u201cMother \u2026\u2026\u201d Yang Huai Shan was in a very difficult position.Lian Fang Zhou \u201cha\u201d as she laughed out, picking her eyebrows up. \u201cIt was you who was stirring trouble. Now you want to teach me a lesson. What a joke!\u201d\u201cYou listen! Huai Shan, listen!\u201d Old Woman Yang was extremely furious. She glared at Yang Huai Shan, her eyes lit up with intimidation.\u201cMiss Lian, can you not say any words right now, I, I -\u201d Yang Huai Shan saw that Old Woman Yang was so furious that was about to hop up and down. His heartfelt complicated and was in a difficult position.This was, after all, his mother, ah.Lian Fang Zhou sneered. \u201cDid I say something wrong? Us siblings were just returning from working in the mountains. Did we provoke anyone? Who was it that wanted to stir up trouble?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As a grown man, doesn\u2019t he have a brain when doing things? Being with his mother and knowing that his mother is dissatisfied with her to no end, but still coming to provoke her, what does he want to do?He\u2019s fine, but did he ever think that she as a young girl who had just broke the marriage arrangement with their family that it would attract a lot of gossiping?If he didn\u2019t look so honest, she would suspect that he is deliberately punishing her!\u201cYou!\u201d Old Woman Yang was mad; hitting her thigh she cried, \u201creally my kindness came to no good! My son\u2019s good heart has been fed to the dogs! The stinky girl does not recognize good from bad, what a thing, na \u2026\u2026\u201dIt was lunch time and a number of villagers began to appear. Lian Fang Zhou could not help but frown. If this continued, she was afraid that they will gather to watch for fun! This vicious old woman, it seems she needs to give her a ruthless scolding, so she will commit it to memory!Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s arched brows were unexpectedly erect; her almond eyes wide open. A fierce aura burst out and Yang Huai Shan got goosebumps his scalp tingling. His heart was secretly disappointed; she was never like this before, before she was so warm, but now she is not even giving me face \u2026\u2026 she really has changed \u2026..\u201cMother! Mother! Just leave it, we still have important business to deal with, so leave it! Let\u2019s go!\u201d Yang Huai Shan rushed to speak before Lian Fang Zhou could and he hurriedly pulled Old Woman Yang.Old Woman Yang hearing his words harrumphed; she gave a provocative stare at Lian Fang Zhou and deliberately exaggerated. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right! We have extremely important \u2018business\u2019 to do! Thank god, my son has a good head and remembered it! I was almost angered by this stinky brat and become muddled headed!\u201dShe coldly stared at Lian Fang Zhou, turned and sneered, \u201cdid you know why we came to Da Fang village? Haha, we came to set the wedding with my future relatives! Look at Huai Shan wearing new clothes with new shoes. He especially put them on for today, na! He Never wore it once before!\u201dA slight change appeared on Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s face and she subconsciously glanced Yang Huai Shan.Yang Huai Shan anxiously looked at her, his face looking shameful. He looked helpless and panicked; he opened his mouth as if trying to explain something, but in the end, he didn\u2019t say anything at all.Lian Fang Zhou chuckled lightly, her eyes turned indifferent and lightly smiled; \u201cis that right? Then quickly scram, don\u2019t block this miss\u2019s road! Ah Ze, Qing\u2019er, Che\u2019er, let \u2018s go!\u201d After saying that, she picked up the bundles of tree strips on the ground to carry and firmly walked forward.Old Woman Yang did not think her reaction would be so indifferent, and it did not meet her expectations. Suddenly she felt it was boring, gently she made a \u201ctsk\u201d sound, spitting the ground, \u201cnot being wanted by anyone, such a useless thing!\u201d\u201cMother! Say a few words less okay!\u201d Yang Huai Shan suddenly scowled angrily.Old Woman Yang opened her eyes wide in disbelief; stunned she looked him up and down and was shaking. \u201cYou, are you even my son? You, you actually, talk to me, like this!\u201d As she was saying this she started sobbing; \u201cI have a bitter fate ah! My son has been so confused by a vixen that he doesn\u2019t even listen to his mother! Vixen, you \u2013 you stop right there!\u201dYang Huai Shan\u2019s breathing started getting heavier, his nostrils puffing out steam. Abruptly he turned around and took a big step to go back, towards his mother\u2019s calls they fell on deaf ears.Old Woman Yang was getting anxious, today she persuaded with every possible mean, soft and hard methods to force Yang Huai Shan to wear new clothes to go out. She did not expect to have such bad luck, they haven\u2019t even entered into Da Fang Village yet, and she bumped into the vixen. If her son left just like this, how would she explain it to her future-in-laws? It was settled that at noon today, that they and the Hua Family will discuss the wedding!If she angered the Hua Family and they broke the engagement, then her son will have dissolved two engagements in a short period of time. How would he be able to marry a good wife then?The Old Woman Yang anxiously called out, \u201cStop!\u201d She jogged to catch up with Yang Huai Shan and angrily said, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cGoing back!\u201d Yang Huai Shan muffled, replied.\u201cYou dare!\u201d Old Woman Yang said angrily, \u201cif you dare to take a step, believe it or not, your mother will kill herself here and now!\u201dYang Huai Shan\u2019s mood suddenly become stagnant.Old Woman Yang suddenly beat her chest and stamped her feet, her face full of bitterness. \u201cYou are my son if you don\u2019t listen to me, how will people trust in me. What face will I have to continue living! What\u2019s so good about that Lian Family girl that will make you so obsessed and lose your mind. For a woman who does not even have you in her eyes, you will even not listen to your mother! You are being unfilial! Our ancestors won\u2019t tolerate it, and heaven will also not allow it!\u201dOnly after her preaching did Yang Huai Shan soften down. He sighed, \u201cMother, don\u2019t mention past matters from now on OK? Lian Family\u2019s engagement to me has already been dissolved. I will also listen to your words and will marry Hua Family\u2019s miss; what else do you want? Fang Zhou, she never offended you, so you should let your mouth accumulate some kindness and don\u2019t say anything, alright? Count it as me begging you! Alright?\u201dOld Woman Yang has never seen her son so pained like this, with a despairing expression. She has also never heard him use this kind of despairing tone, until the pinnacle of pleading while speaking to her. For a moment her heart ached, feeling angry as well as helpless; it was like a heavy stone pressing on her chest, it was heavy and left her muffled and sour.\u201cAlright then! Let us go, if we don\u2019t hurry we\u2019ll be late!\u201d Old Woman Yang sighed, pulling Yang Huai Shan to go back to Da Fang Village.Yang Huai Shan glanced at her, took a deep breath and silently followed behind her.\u201cSister,\u201d after returning home and placing the tree strips down, Lian Ze carefully said, \u201care you all right? If you don\u2019t feel happy -\u201dIf she\u2019s not happy then what? Lian Ze didn\u2019t know. So he also didn\u2019t know how to comfort Lian Fang Zhou, but his heart felt very sad.So he quietly said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sister.\u201dLian Fang Zhou was just using the water from the wells to fill a basin to wash their face and hands. Hearing what was said, she raised her head and laughed at Lian Ze. \u201cLook at you, how am I not happy? From what I see, you look more depressed than I am! Alright then, quickly go in and take a break. Wait until noon for something to eat. We still have to get the rest of the tree strips and those branches to bring back! \u201dHer bright smile was like the sun dispersing away the dark clouds in his heart. Lian Ze\u2019s heart relaxed and hurriedly said, \u201cSister really isn\u2019t upset?\u201d\u201cNot sad!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled. \u201cThe dissolving engagement thing, I took the initiative to mention it; why would I be sad?\u201d\u201cSister, they are bad people, let\u2019s ignore them!\u201d Lian Fang Qing said angrily.Lian Che also said, \u201cwhen I grow up, I\u2019ll protect Sister, nobody is allowed to bully Sister!\u201d\u201cYes, that Old Woman Yang is the most horrible, I spit at her!\u201d Lian Fang Qing nodded.Lian Fang Zhou \u201cPuchi as she started laughing; a burst of warmth spread in her heart, softly she talked to them: \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll wait until you grow up, no one would even think about bullying us! Let\u2019s enter the house!\u201dLian Fang Zhou was unhappy, but not the kind of Lian Ze was thinking.She\u2019s unhappy that since Yang Huai Shan has decided to marry the Hua Family girl, why does he not know how to avoid arousing suspicion? He actually approached her? What does he mean? Pretending to be lovers?While on one side he is marrying another woman, the other side he is pitying her. This is kind of lover makes most people feel nauseous!Since he decided to marry another woman, then he should completely forget about her. He should single-mindedly live with the other person! If he still thinks about her, then he should have the ability refuse the marriage with the Hua Family to the end!Since he has no courage and will not resist to the end, then don\u2019t come try to entangle with her!The day he said to her, on his father and mother\u2019s side, he will think of something, his insistence she saw it clearly. Although the engagement has already been dissolved, but if, if he could fight for her until the end and is able to protect her and he can the pay price for gaining her, then marrying him isn\u2019t impossible.After all, in this strange ancient era, wanting to marry a man like this isn\u2019t an easy task.But no, only after few days, ah, he was dressed in brand new clothes and was running to the new wife\u2019s family to settle on the wedding!Don\u2019t talk to her about difficulties! She only wants to see the results! The result is: He really is a weakling and did things like this!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Chapter 20 Mrs Liu came to insult again part 1Translated by Maggie Edited by XD(a kind reader)Lian Fang Zhou smiled a self-deprecating smile while berating herself: she thinks too highly of herself, actually wishing that a man would be willing to work hard for her, fight for her, give her everything \u2026For a nearly thirty-year-old person to still have such an unrealistic dream ah! Is it because she transmigrated to a really young body?Or is it because she wanted to become dependent on someone?Pai (mentally spitting)! This great aunt can rely on herself, why need to rely on men? Having no man, one can still live very well!Lian Fang Zhou poured the water out of the basin, dried her hands, and turned around to return to the house.At noon they simply ate something. Then Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze went to the mountains to move stuff.Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che were tired from the morning, so bothstayed at home.Lian Fang Qing\u2019s precious mushrooms that were gathered were incredible. Once they returned, she and Lian Che gathered water and, one by one, scrubbed all the mushrooms clean. They wanted Lian Fang Zhou to promise to cook them tonight. They were content, facial features curved into smile.Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze went back and forth four times before they finished. They were so tired that their back, legs, and arms ached.Lian Fang Zhou wiped off the sweat on her forehead, rubbed her aching shoulder, and secretly sighed: farm work can be really laborious! With me and Ah Ze\u2019s amount of labor, if we go according to plan \u2013 digging the soil to produce enough food to fill four people\u2019s stomach, and also for Che-er to go to school, and in the future have enough for Ah Ze and Che\u2019er to marry \u2026 Qing-er also needs a dowry \u2026 it is really too difficult! How should I, with the background of professional researcher in agriculture, feel ah!This year there\u2019s no problem, but next year I need to change the working method \u2026Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze came home in the evening. Their two little siblings felt how tired they were, so they thoughtfully fetched water for them wash their hands and face and poured tea for them.Lian Fang Qing clenched her hands into small fists to pound her sister back (i.e. massage). Lian Che went to the kitchen to prepare the fire to cook \u2026Lian Fang Zhou was pleased. For the sake of this feeling they showed, she must let her family live a good life.After a short break, Lian Fang Zhou cooked a half pot of water in the iron pot on the stove, slicing the ash-bag mushrooms one by one.When the pot of water boiled, she placed the slices in, stirred for a while with chopsticks. After about three or four minutes, she drained mushrooms and placed them in a basin filled with water to float.While doing this, she casually said to Lian Ze and Lian Fang Qing: \u201cThere are a variety of mushrooms in the mountains. Different types have different methods of cooking. Some can be directly fried or used in soup. Some need to be soaked overnight in cold water. Some need to be boiled, and some have to be salted over or else, ah, recklessly eating will lead to problems! Most villagers in village don\u2019t know that, so when they see them they dare not pick them!\u201dLian Fang Qing started clapping, full of worship smiled: \u201cSister is very awesome! Sister knows everything! From now on, we will pick a lot!\u201dLian Ze also came to that realization and lightly nodded. Hearing what Lian Fang Zhou said, he subconsciously glanced at her. He did not question. He already said that no matter what his sister did, he unconditionally believed it! He fully believed that she have them in her heart!The porridge was nearly done, and Lian Fang Zhou burned more firewood to make the side dishes. The ash bag mushroom was done soaking and were drained. The garlic was cut into paste, the ginger cut into shreds and then chopped. A few dry chili peppers were brought out. Once the pan was hot, the ginger, garlic, and dried hot pepper were thrown in and sizzled in pan. Finally, Lian Fang Zhou stirred in the ash bag mushrooms.Cooking over the fire, the natural wild mushrooms\u2019 unique aroma quickly spread. With the accompanying smell of ginger, garlic, and dry chili flavor it became a very tantalizing scent.Lian Fang Qing looked at the pan of stir fry mushroom. Upon thinking that they picked these themselves, a sense of pride spontaneously arose.Once out of the pan, she rushed forward to help carry it. She exaggeratedly sniffed with her nose while smiling \u2018til her face was blooming: \u201cReally fragrant ah!\u201dLian Ze glanced at that big bowl of oily mushroom. He felt rather distressed and whispered: \u201chow can it not smell fragrant, putting in so much oil \u2026\u201dLian Fang Zhou was momentarily surprised, then her heart secretly felt ashamed and bad.She comes from the modern time, so also had the modern habits. She cooked with more oil and did not feel anything was wrong!However, ignoring the fact that the price of oil in ancient times were expensive, their family cannot afford to eat only oily dishes at home ah!\u201cThis, this is my fault! A moment of being careless!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou wryly smiled. She thought of last night\u2019s fried eggs. When she cooked, didn\u2019t she also put in two tablespoons of oil!Yesterday, presumably Lian Ze has tolerated and did not say anything. Tonight seeing that she done it again, he could not stand it.According to her cooking habits, he was afraid that this half bottle of oil will run out after half a month. Long afterward did Lian Fang Zhou find out that a half bottle of oil could originally last for half a year!\u201cThis oil is expensive; from now on I\u2019ll put less in cooking!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled toward Lian Ze.Lian Ze then smiled: \u201cIn fact, putting oil in or not is the same, can\u2019t fill the stomach. Put two drops in is enough.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled as she nodded, feeling more and more guilty of her own ignorance.After the four finished dinner, Lian Che diligently cleaned up the table and went to the kitchen. While Lian Fang Qing went to wash the dishes.Lian Fang Zhou saw that a big pot of evening bath water was already boiled. Actually, she was tired and let the two little ones busy themselves while she sat in the main room to rest. Her mind was consciously wondering how they were going to live in the future days. It was a nice evening, but somehow some people just wanted to come and create trouble.Outside sounded a sharp condemning yell. This yell, Lian Fang Zhou is very familiar with. This is the condemning yell she had hear when she just transmigrated. Hua Family\u2019s daughter-in-law, Mrs. Liu came again.It seems that the matter during the day was known by Hua Family\u2019s people, who couldn\u2019t endure the anger and sent their daughter-in-law over to scold.\u201cObviously it was the Yang Family who provoke us and caused trouble. Despite that, she comes to our doorstep to curse! I\u2019ll go chase her away!\u201d Lian Ze angrily rushed off.\u201cIt\u2019s better that I go!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou stopped him. Light footstep quickly went to the yard, filled a basin of cold water, and quickly walked outside. *Splash!* and it was poured toward the Mrs. Liu again.And the differences from last time is that water was in a bigger basin and colder. Also, the splashing strength is also greater.\u201cAHH! Lian Fang Zhou, you, you\u2014achoo!\u201d Mrs Liu did not expect to get another splash of water out of nowhere. She was shocked as well as angry. She sneezed since she was soaking cold as well as anxious.\u201cWhat you! Are you addicted to insulting, you shrew? Having problems or not, you run to our home to go wild? You think this great aunt is easy to bully, right? Scram, otherwise I will splash you!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou shouted as she menacingly stared at her.\u201cYou, you, you seduced our family son-in-law, you\u2019re shameless!\u201d Mrs. Liu was embarrassed as she wiped off water on her face. She directed a glare at Lian Fang Zhou, and shouted: \u201cQuickly come and see, ah, you quickly come look ah! Lian Family\u2019s girl making a scene! She hit someone (TLN-she didn\u2019t)! Shamelessly seduce men and walking sideway (running from responsibility. If you read Stunning Edge when Cliff was trying to make Claire his disciple, you\u2019ll get it)! Come and see ah!\u201d\u201cMrs. Liu, you dare to talk nonsense again!\u201d Lian Ze paled with anger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Is that not the guy I didn\u2019t want and dissolved the engagement with? So it was picked up by your family ah? He\u2019s only a thing that I didn\u2019t want, why would I go seduce him? Mrs Liu, do not think that I\u2019m afraid of you. If you dare say another word of this nonsense again, tomorrow we will go looking for a judge or go to the county court; it\u2019s your choice! If you have the ability, go and call your family\u2019s son-in-law. Let\u2019s say this clearly face to face. When did I seduce him? If you can\u2019t call your family\u2019s son-in-law for a confrontation, then shut up! Otherwise, don\u2019t blame me for being rude! You go stirring up trouble and are nothing but a gossiping loose-tongued woman, you staying in our Da Fang village will only corrupt the village\u2019s reputation.\u201dAt this time, there was already a lot of people gathered around to watch; everyone had heard Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s words. Her head was held high and her chest raised standing in front of Mrs Liu not letting go in the slightest. The Lian siblings eyed her with hostility and their young faces were full of anger. They could not help but point toward Mrs Liu and gossip.Aunt Zhang stood out and said loudly, \u201cFang Zhou, that child, I watched her grow up; I believe she is innocent. Mrs Liu, you with nothing but a verbal statement came running to ruin another family daughter\u2019s reputation is a bit too much, right? Fang Zhou is right, you said she seduced your family\u2019s son-in-law, then it is better to call your family\u2019s son-in-law over and let your family\u2019s son-in-law personally say whether there is such a thing! You are also accusing a good person, don\u2019t you also think so!\u201dEveryone nodded, and without exception echoed.The Lian Family and Yang Family\u2019s engagement was settled for many years. Were it not for the parents of the Lian Family dying in an accident, they would not be able to break it.This side\u2019s bones have yet to cool and on the other side, the Yang Family clamored to break the engagement. This matter, it was originally the Yang Family in the wrong!The Hua Family was even more overboard, let\u2019s not mention robbing other people\u2019s fiance, they also bullied the few parentless siblings; they were throwing dirty water at other people. All the neighbors did not like what they saw.Mrs Liu was subjected to her mother-in-law\u2019s commands to come over and vent some anger; who knew that Lian Fang Zhou was still cursed from the last time was still not better. She was still so bold! She actually poured her from head to toe with water! Really, really outrageous!What\u2019s more, what has this to do with Aunt Zhang? Why did she stand up for her? Also, what does it have to do with the people of this village? Every one of them was talking too much \u2026.. (TL/N: Ummm\u2026you called them over and now you wish they were gone?)Mrs Liu originally intended to curse and vent out some anger, but this time she was riding a tiger and was having a hard time getting off.If she called the future son-in-law for confrontation? First of all, don\u2019t mention Lian Fang Zhou being so calm, clear and very confident. More importantly, if the son-in-law said, \u201cno\u201d then, wouldn\u2019t it be her own loss? In the future, how could she meet people? If the son-in-law said \u201cyes,\u201d that is even worse, wouldn\u2019t it mean that her own family\u2019s girl would become a joke?So, regardless, toward her own family, there is no benefit! This confrontation was impossible!Lian Fang Zhou was unwilling to forgive or let it drop. She approached Mrs Liu and sneered, \u201cMrs Liu, my father, and mother are gone but that does not mean that us siblings will let people bully us. We are all from the same village, we take the same paths and drink water from the same river. Why is your heart so narrow, mean and vicious? Coming to specifically pick on us! Those words of yours, every sentence was trying to force me to death; are you happy? When have we siblings offended you? Can you tell me clearly? Today, if you don\u2019t explain clearly, don\u2019t expect to leave!\u201dThe more people listened, the more they felt sympathetic. Their eyes toward Mrs Liu were increasingly filled with contempt and were talking non-stop.A burst of white and green appeared on Mrs Liu\u2019s face; she was suddenly condemned by the crowd and she felt somewhat overwhelmed, she was a little panicked. Just then, she caught a glimpse of Wang San \u2018s Wife in the crowd, she pointed at her and yelled, \u201cI did not lie! You, it was you who tried to seduce our family\u2019s son-in-law! It was Wang San\u2019s Wife who told me that she saw it and if you don\u2019t believe me, you can ask her.\u201dWang San\u2019s Wife saw everyone\u2019s eyes simultaneously turn towards her, she suddenly panicked and hurriedly said, \u201cwhat nonsense are you saying! Why pour dirty water on me? When did I say this? Something like that never happened!\u201dMrs Liu became anxious, she rushed forward to pull Wang San\u2019s Wife\u2019s arms tightly to hold her, \u201cIn the evening when you passed our door, you said it! You said at noon when our family\u2019s son-in-law and his mother were entering the village, that Lian Family girl approached them and threw herself at him- \u201d\u201cLies! Lies!\u201d Wang San\u2019s Wife used some strength to pluck off Mrs Liu\u2019s hands. Not waiting for her to finish, she glared at her, \u201cI never said that! I say, Mrs Liu, you are coming to Fang Zhou\u2019s door to make a scene and it isn\u2019t the first time. Who doesn\u2019t know you are so disparaging! I passed your home? My home is in the north of the village, yours is in the south, why would I go passed your door! Oh, I remember now, two days ago the two of us had a dispute; now you want to get even with me. Damn you, Mrs Liu, you\u2019re so detestable!\u201d\u201cYou -\u201d Mrs Liu was about to go mad and angrily said, \u201ca good thing you are, you dare say something but will not dare to admit it; you deceived me! I\u2019m not finished with you!\u201dMrs Liu lifted her hand towards Wang San\u2019s Wife to hit her.\u201cAh! Damn you Mrs Liu, you are actually hitting people now, you bitch!\u201d Wang San\u2019s Wife wasn\u2019t the brightest, she was screaming as she immediately fought back, these two people were now tussling around.When everyone first saw this, they were stunned; then followed by \u201cwoots\u201d burst out laughing, pointing as they mocked.\u201cYo, these two started fighting!\u201d\u201cFight, fight, this is a good thing\u2026..\u201dLian Fang Zhou and her siblings were also shocked, they never thought things would evolve into this.Lian Fang Qing clapped her hands and giggled. Making Lian Che lightly pull her sleeves and gently shook his head. She cheekily stuck out her tongue at her second brother and changed to biting her lips as she secretly laughed.\u201cYou stinky bitch, I see that you have run out again and went crazy, for what! The bowls have not been washed, the bath water has also not been heated and you\u2019re still not hurrying back!\u201d Mrs Liu\u2019s man, Hua Lao Wu suddenly jumped out and yelled, wanting to take Mrs Liu away.Seeing that his wife\u2019s hair and whole body was completely wet, with her hair disheveled, her face with finger long bloodstains and her clothes having pieces torn out, he could not help but be furious at heart. When he was breaking them apart, he took the opportunity to help his wife.Mrs. Liu was going mad with anger, and now that she had her husband\u2019s help, why would she need to be polite anymore. In the chaos, she severely twisted Wang San\u2019s Wife in the waist two times, making Wang San\u2019s wife cry like a pig.\u201cAh! Damn you, Mrs Liu, you tore this old lady\u2019s flesh! Hua Lao Wu, aren\u2019t you a good thing, you\u2019re taking advantage of this old lady! Help! The Hua Family couple wants to murder!\u201dWang San\u2019s Wife\u2019s shameless-like yell fooled Hua Lao Wu, as he hurried to the side to hide.One needs to know that in Da Fang Village, among the one hundred families, Zhang and Wang are the two most popular and prestigious surnames. If Wang San\u2019s Wife insisted that he \u201cmolested\u201d her, then later on the Wang Family might come knocking on the door, then he will suffer!Once Hua Lao Wu stepped aside, Wang San\u2019s Wife immediately took the opportunity to rush towards Mrs Liu and fiercely beat her.Wang San\u2019s Wife\u2019s strength was too big, making Mrs Liu stagger and fall to the ground. Wang San\u2019s Wife also unflinchingly carried on and heavily beat Mrs Liu\u2019s body, the two swore and tussled again.\u201cAh, an accident is going to happen, quickly pull them away!\u201d The people who were in the crowd watching the fun exclaimed, making everyone wake up. A few old aunties and young wives hurriedly stepped forward, scrambling to pull Mrs Liu and Wang San\u2019s Wife apart.The two people were already so messy; their clothes and hair both looked embarrassing and funny, the two people were not satisfied with the other. Both eyes were wide open with hatred and glared at each other, they were still struggling while screaming without care. It seems as long as they could get free, they would immediately swoop forward and start another round of beating.The Wang Family\u2019s aunties tried persuading with every method they had, and Wang San\u2019s Wife was finally taken away. Hua Lao Wu was berating her as he approached to take Mrs Liu away.At this time, Lian Fang Zhou had enough of the liveliness; she coldly smiled loudly saying, \u201chold on!\u201d She steadily blocked the path front of Mrs Liu, her eyes staring at her coldly and said, \u201cMrs Liu, you can\u2019t go, the matter just now still hasn\u2019t been made clear!\u201d(ED/N: Hey everyone, Simple here; first let me apologize for the slow releases, RL came at me with a hard ball and so it left me with little to no time to edit.

What more do you want to do!\u201dHua Lao Wu was extremely angry in his heart, he thought, \u201cI dare not provoke the Wang Family, but the Lian Family is a small radish head I dare not mess with it? If I\u2019m afraid of you, then from now on I don\u2019t even need to bother mingling in the village.\u201dLian Fang Zhou snorted. \u201cWhat I want to do, your wife knows clearly. She poured dirty water on me, I just want to ask her what she wants to do! You\u2019re a grown man, in front of this helpless little girl, what do you to plan to do? Your family started this fight; can\u2019t even beat the other person with your own bad luck! You think my Lian family is weak and can\u2019t compare to the Wang Family, so you can freely insult us right? Then you\u2019ve got the wrong idea. If you don\u2019t make things clear today, we\u2019ll go find a judge, and ask the judge to give justice! how about it?\u201dAunt Zhang immediately stood beside Lian Fang Zhou and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, Fang Zhou is already pitiful enough. I say, this engagement with your family, what is there that you\u2019re not satisfied with, that you need to ruin others? Anyhow, we\u2019re all from the same village, looking down and won\u2019t see, look up and you will see. What is the point of doing this? If you really force these siblings to death, will you be able to have a peaceful mind and conscience!\u201dHua Lao Wu froze and couldn\u2019t say anything.It was his mother who wanted his wife to come over to scold Lian Fang Zhou. Although he felt it wasn\u2019t a very good idea and he tried persuading a bit, he wasn\u2019t able to change her mind, so he let it be.Just now when he saw his own wife suffer, he rushed over wanting to take her away. Who knew Wang San\u2019s Wife would interfere and go crazy!After much difficulty was Wang San\u2019s Wife finally persuaded to leave. He had thought this matter would end here. How could he have known that Lian Fang Zhou pop out again and not let it drop!How important is the reputation of a girl? When Aunt Zhang said forcing people to death, it wasn\u2019t an exaggeration. In everyone\u2019s heart, they understood and one after the other couldn\u2019t help but start talking again.Lian Fang Zhou felt a burst of sadness and sympathy in her heart. Wasn\u2019t the once mighty Lian Fang Zhou forced to death by Mrs Liu\u2019s words? If she did not accidentally transmigrate over, leaving Lian Ze, Lian Che and Lian Fang Qing behind, she didn\u2019t know how pitiful these three would be!From this point of view, wanting Mrs Liu to pay with her life isn\u2019t excessive!But this matter, she had no way saying it out loud and could only let Mrs Liu off lightly.\u201cThen what do you want?\u201d Hua Lao Wu took a deep breath and asked Lian Fang Zhou.Lian Fang Zhou coldly said, \u201cmake her apologize and make it clear in front of the folks here, that she is making trouble for no reason; that she is talking nonsense and promise that she will not do the same thing again in the future!\u201d\u201cWhy should I!\u201d Mrs Liu had not calmed down yet from fighting with Wang San\u2019s Wife, so she Immediately burst into anger again when she heard she must apologize.\u201cShut up will ya!\u201d Hua Lao Wu glared at her when he heard her speak. He said to Lian Fang Zhou, \u201cI promise she will not talk nonsense anymore! This way it is enough, right?\u201dLian Fang Zhou stared at him indifferently and said, \u201cIf us four siblings weren\u2019t parentless orphans, would you dare to say that? Do you think this is enough?\u201d\u201cThat right isn\u2019t it obvious that they are bullying!\u201d\u201cOh, these parentless children, what a sin, ah!\u201dHua Lao Wu\u2019s face burst into shades red and white. He finally experienced how shrewd and powerful Lian Fang Zhou is. Seeing that he can\u2019t fool them, he could only glare at Mrs Liu lowly shouting \u201cwhat are you waiting for? Still not quickly apologizing to them? In the future control your mouth and talk less nonsense!\u201dIt was obviously her mother-in-law\u2019s idea, why should she have to shoulder the black pot? Mrs Liu\u2019s heart felt hundreds of thousands of times unwilling and felt aggrieved, but she could not say it.Being a daughter-in-law to push all responsibility to the mother-in-law in front of everyone, if Hua Lao Wu doesn\u2019t divorce her, then it\u2019ll be strange!Mrs Liu had endless bitterness but couldn\u2019t speak about it. she resentfully returned a glare at Hua Lao Wu.Hua Lao Wu was starting to get somewhat impatient, the longer they stayed the more humiliating it was, he then again quietly shouted, \u201cquickly apologize, did you not hear?\u201dMrs. Liu\u2019s eyes blackened, she so angry that she almost fainted. Finally, with her husband\u2019s coercion did she reluctantly speak up, \u201cSorry \u2026\u2026\u201dLian Fang Zhou did not speak, she just coldly stared at them.Hua Lao Wu was really annoyed, he grabbed Mrs Liu and made her turn to face Lian Fang Zhou, yelling, \u201cyou playing dead? Just now in the fight, you had such spirit, where did it go? Telling you to apologize is not going to kill you! Hurry up, do not make me lose face!\u201d\u201cYou \u2013 Hua Lao Wu you are heartless!\u201d Mrs Liu felt aggrieved, stamped her feet, and started clutching her face and cried.\u201cYou want to cry, want to scold and want to get even; you couple please go back and do that, don\u2019t waste my time! We siblings have worked for the whole day today and we need to go back and rest. Tomorrow we need to get up early to work!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou looked at them coldly.\u201cYou hear that!\u201d Hua Lao Wu really could not listen anymore to everyone\u2019s discussion and see their fingers pointed at them, he even understood Mrs Liu\u2019s intentions. She felt that apologizing to Lian Fang Zhou, a little girl is embarrassing and will lose face. She had delusions of fooling them to avoid it, but Lian Fang Zhou is not so easy to fool.Everyone in the neighborhood saw it, and more and more firmly believed that the Hua Family is bullying a family of orphans, this isn\u2019t a good for their reputation!\u201cListen well, if you don\u2019t properly apologize and cause the Hua Family\u2019s reputation to drop, don\u2019t believe that I won\u2019t divorce you! If I can say it then I can do it; It\u2019s up to you.\u201d Hua Lao Wu leaned close to Mrs Liu\u2019s ear and coldly whispered.Mrs Liu\u2019s heart chilled, she lifted her eyes to look at Hua Lao Wu\u2019s solemn face and it killed all her resistance. She faced Lian Fang Zhou and said in a quiet tone, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u2026 it was me talking nonsense, I created trouble out of nothing, I should not have! In the future\u2014 I will never do it again!\u201dLian Fang Zhou indifferently said, \u201cthis is what you personally said, I hope you can remember it! If you ever talk nonsense again and try to ruin my reputation, whether in front of my face or secretly behind my back, my Father and Mother in heaven will not spare you! If I say it like this, do you dare accept?\u201dMrs Liu was surprised and her heart \u201cthumped\u201d as it jumped.\u201cAccept or not!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou snapped.Mrs Liu was shocked to see a cold as knife-like eyes from Lian Fang Zhou, she for actually no reason felt a burst of fear sprout from the bottom of her heart. She subconsciously blurted out, \u201caccept! I accept!\u201d\u201cThen that\u2019s good!\u201d Said Lian Fang Zhou. Glancing over at the neighbors, she said, \u201call the neighbors here are witnesses, Fang Zhou will thank you first!\u201dEveryone said, \u201cit\u2019s something we should do.\u201dAunt Zhang laughed and said, \u201calright alright! So it\u2019s just a misunderstanding! All is well, everyone scatter, scatter!\u201dEveryone was still talking as they dispersed. Mrs Liu and Hua Lao Wu had already fled the scene.\u201cOh, it\u2019s been hard on you, Fang Zhou! Now you can be at ease. From now on no one would dare to use this matter to talk nonsense! Alright, the day is not new and it is getting late, quickly go back, wash and rest early.\u201d Aunt Zhang lovingly stroked Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s head and softly said.\u201cThank you, Aunt Zhang, if it wasn\u2019t for you, I\u2019m afraid it wouldn\u2019t have gone so well!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou looked up at Aunt Zhang, her heart bursting with gratitude.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No need to thank me, look at you, thanking people again!\u201d Aunt Zhang chuckled, and said, \u201cdon\u2019t exhaust yourself too much in the future. If there is heavy work, just say it to us and let your Uncle Li and Brother San Ge go do it! You\u2019re a girl, how much strength could you have?

That is a matter for a lifetime, na!\u201d\u201cEn, Aunt rest assured, I will take good care of Ah Ze and the others!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s heart warmed up and nodded as she smiled.Aunt Zhang saw that she purposely ignored the first half of the sentence, and couldn\u2019t help sigh; at the moment it wasn\u2019t good to say anything more, so she simply said a few words, then went back.\u201cLet\u2019s go! We\u2019ll also go in and rest! Tomorrow we need to wake up early.\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled, holding Lian Fang Qing\u2019s hand in one hand and Lian Che in the other.\u201cSister, Sister, we won, right? Mrs Liu that bad guy, that rotten egg lost!\u201d Lian Fang Qing\u2019s round eyes were wide open and asked as she looked up.\u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d Lian Fang Zhou was a little dumbfounded, this little girl, look at that little face filled with excitement, how could she know this matter was very perilous. If she made one bad move, then she would have suffered thousands of accusing fingers, and the one everyone would have cast aside is her!\u201cGood little girl, go back and obediently sleep! This matter, you\u2019re not allowed to talk about it anymore. In the future, if you see the Hua Family\u2019s people, take a detour, understand?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou sternly smiled as she said to her.Lian Fang Qing blinked her eyes, obediently said \u201cen,\u201d and whispered, \u201cI do not want to give way to her\u2026\u2026 They are all bad people\u2026\u2026\u201dThe next day, after breakfast, Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze took the little twins to the garden. She and Lian Ze stuck the long tree strips into the ground and were tied to the pile and woven tightly three times. Lian Fang Qing and Lian Ze then got some twigs and sticks, tightly stuck them into the interwoven strips, and the vegetable garden was thoroughly surrounded.Aunt Zhang and Mrs Zhao had originally come to help, but Lian Fang Zhou insisted that it was easy work and definitely didn\u2019t need help. So Aunt Zhang could only give up.Originally full of reluctance, Mrs Zhao saw the situation and her heart felt more comfortable; she frankly shot a smile at Lian Fang Zhou.After spending a whole morning fencing the garden, at noon they took a break for more than an hour. In the afternoon Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze tidied up the garden again and made the soil even. They transported some ash from the stove and chicken manure from the chicken coop, mixed evenly into the soil, doused it with water and made it ready for tomorrow to plant the seedlings. This place will be used as a nursery.In the evening, Lian Fang Zhou picked up packs of herbs, wrapped it in a yellow paper that this body\u2019s mother used last year.At home, naturally, no one can read. So these yellow papers were marked with black charcoal marks, it must have been used to distinguish between the variety of seeds by this body\u2019s mother.Lian Fang Zhou held these yellow paper bags in her hand and thought of people that have already passed away; she could not help but be secretly sad for a moment.Although she doesn\u2019t recognize the marks on the yellow paper bag, but she was a professional agricultural researcher; so towards a variety of agricultural seeds, she is no stranger. Just taking a look at what\u2019s in her hand will make it crystal clear.Among these seeds, there were several kinds, like daikon, celery, napa, cabbage, bok choy, Chinese cabbage, and cauliflower.She opened one pack after the other. She used a stick around the size of a coin and gently rolled back and forth, the outer skin of the seeds got thinner or even slightly cracked.Then she found three shallow dishes and placed the seeds on them. Damion and celery seeds were put into separate dishes; the remaining seeds were mixed and placed into one dish. Water was then added to each dish until it covered the surface of the seed.It should soak for one night, and the next morning the seed bud will sprout out. This way of planting it, it will not only sprout out faster, but germination rate is higher as well.While Lian Fang Zhou was doing these things, Lian Fang Qing sat nearby with her hands on her cheeks with her beautiful eyes wide open looking at her curiously.Lian Fang Zhou smiled at her and just let her be.She put the three dishes on the table. The next morning, once she woke up, and sure enough the seeds cracked out a gap; popping out a little bit of a white bud.After breakfast, she went to the vegetable garden with Lian Fang Qing and sprinkled the seeds and watered them.They will only need a few days before they can have fresh vegetable seedlings to eat.She needs to wait until the vegetable seedlings grow until they were two fingers long, then they can pick up those that are healthy and robust to transplant.Lian Fang Zhou also looked at the pepper plant that was slightly trimmed and fertilized a few days ago and found that it had turned green and bloomed out a lot of small white flowers. Little fruits can be seen, her heart burst with joy.Lian Fang Qing is also giggling happily. \u201cMy Sister is really great! This pepper is growing again!\u201dLian Fang Zhou laughed, \u201cwait until the pepper grows up, then Sister will make fried eggs, OK?\u201d\u201cEn! Tender pepper is not one bit spicy, I like to eat them the most!\u201d Lian Fang Qing smiled as she nodded, she also said, \u201cSister and second brother should also eat them!\u201dNow Lian Fang Zhou can really cook one or two eggs every day for her and Lian Che, but Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze themselves don\u2019t eat them, so that was why Lian Fang Qing said this.Unexpectedly, Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s heart felt warm, smiling as she casually said, \u201cOK!\u201dThese little guys, they always make her feel moved.The sisters shut the door to the vegetable garden and returned home. Lian Ze and Lian Che went to dig sweet potatoes; they were afraid that they\u2019ll only return at noon.After a break, Lian Fang Zhou did not feel relieved and was worried. She then called out to Lian Fang Qing to lead the way and the both of the went.That piece of land where the sweet potatoes are at are in the northwest of the village. It is six miles on the horsehead slope, at the bottom of the slope was a road winding along the mountain, the land was on that hillside.The field was about a mu (1 mu= 0.0667 hectares) or so, 3 or 4 parts were planted with sweet potatoes; also, 2 parts had a variety of taro. It was just a month until harvesting time.The rest of the plants were cowpea, soybeans, chili peppers and the like. Since at this time of the year, it has already passed the right time to plant; so the ground is full of messy yellow vine foliage.Near the edge of the slope, two slanting large bowls were growing on the thick pear tree. Lian Fang Zhou went over to take a look and then said, \u201cthis pear tree is not fruitful, next year we need to cut it.\u201d\u201cWhen it blooms it\u2019s really nice to see, sister can we please keep it!\u201d Lian Fang Qing in a spoiled manner immediately opposed.Lian Che scratched his head and said, \u201cevery year Mother planted pumpkin, winter melon and musk melons at the bottom of the tree; then let them climb up for fruition, why do we need cut it, sister?\u201dIt was then that Lian Fang Zhou noticed on the top of the tree there was also hanging a lot of semi- dry, semi yellow vines. She suddenly realized something, she smiled and said, 'so it\u2019s like that ah, then keep it, let\u2019s not cut it!\u201dShe could also see that on the vines there was a lot of melon stems, presumably because there was no food so the melon has long been since picked away.Lian Fang Zhou secretly shook her head. This bodies respected one, (the bodies former owner), can be really muddled head while living her life. She was a fourteen to fifteen-year-old girl, let\u2019s not talk about others, but she couldn\u2019t even grow some food to eat, and just counted on the Yang Family\u2019s marriage! She does not know why that Yang Huai Shan was so set on loving her\u2026Lian Ze had already dug a lot of sweet potatoes, with the exact same method of planting the vegetable garden. It\u2019s not like the modern method of stem or root cutting, but from a seed to a sweet potato. This is such a waste, ah!Lian Fang Zhou went up and took the hoe from Lian Ze and smiled, \u201cAh Ze, take a break and I\u2019ll do it! We\u2019ll dig this all up today. In the evening I\u2019ll go find Hunter Sun to see when he\u2019s going to Mount Xian Teng!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hunter Sun went so many times, didn\u2019t he come back completely fine? Where can we go, where we can not go, how far in that forest we can go, he definitely knows it inside out! By following him, there will be no problems! \u201cLian Ze saw that he couldn\u2019t persuade her and only muffled out a, \u201cOh.\u201dLian Fang Zhou looked around and found that except for the forest, the only thing in sight was a wasteland of many long shrubs and weeds. it is a very suitable environment for reclamation and farming.Lian Fang Zhou could not help but look with envy. In the end, this is the ancient era; ah, if it was modern times, don\u2019t mention being a wasteland, she was afraid the woodland would be reclaimed.\u201cSo much wasteland, but unfortunately we don\u2019t enough strength. It would be good if we can reclaim the land! We can grow a lot of things!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou could not help but sigh.\u201cSister,\u201d Lian Ze looked at her and smiled. \u201cHow can it be so easy! Reclamation of a wasteland needs to have proof or a certificate, it needs measurements, the value needs to be estimated, and then we have to pay for it. After that, we need to go to the county head to put it on record, get the land lease and then it\u2019ll count!\u201d\u201cWe also need money!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou now understood, no wonder no one had done reclamation!\u201cHow much money is one mu?\u201d She quickly asked.\u201cThis I don\u2019t know.\u201d Lian Ze shook his head and said, \u201cno matter how much it is, right now we can\u2019t reclaim it anyway!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou laughed; 'so we wait until we can afford and then we\u2019ll try. It\u2019s just mountains, not a fertile land, I expect it won\u2019t go anywhere!\u201dSpend some money to get the land in hand, that is a good thing \u2026 \u2026\u201cEven so, it depends if it worth it or not,\u201d Lian Ze said. \u201cThis wasteland after reclamation, every year we have to pay taxes! It seems to be 300wen per an acre of land.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d so in the ancient era, there\u2019s also a tax for so many things! If there were agricultural loans, that would be good!The four of them were busy for half a day, then they finally dug out all the sweet potatoes. Lian Ze and Lian Fang Zhou loaded them into baskets and each picked up half a big basket. Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che also each got a bamboo basket, each of them carried a basket.Four individuals moved like ants, they went back and forth three times. With great difficulty, they transported these sweet potatoes back home.Previously it was straightforwardly stacked in the corner of the room, but now Lian Fang Zhou let it all pile up in the attic.the attic was dry, so the sweet potatoes wouldn\u2019t rot, and they can be better preserved. And what\u2019s more, the water contained in the sweet potato will slowly evaporate even more; this way sugar content will increase and when it is eaten it\u2019ll be even sweeter.In fact, there\u2019s a lot of ways to eat sweet potatoes. Besides making sweet potato porridge, they can bake it at the stove side and they can cook a sweet potato sweet soup. When the skin is removed, it can be cut into thin slices, \u00a0placed into a batter and be deep fried. They can also make dry sweet potato shreds, steam them and cut into pieces and spread it out in the sun to dry for dried sweet potato. If ground into a powder, it can also be also made into a variety of flavored desserts; they can also be beaten into a paste and be used to make a sweet potato flour\u2026.However, looking at the economic state of the present Lian Family, that cooking method was something Lian Fang Zhou can only dream about.Sweet potato flour, sweet potato desserts, boiled sweet soup, it all seems so distant. There is also the sugar needed, plus all the oil it would take to deep fry, Lian Ze would eat her instead!The only methods that could be given some thoughts about are, to make some sweet potatoes into shreds or sun-dried sweet potatoes.With just these, she can\u2019t make a lot, because after all with this method of cooking, the taste may be better, but it basically only counts as snacks. It can\u2019t fill the stomach, ah! And they need these sweet potatoes to fill stomachs for now!So they can only have some good meals occasionally and \u00a0leave some for the Chinese New Years to eat.After finishing dinner early, Lian Fang Zhou forced Lian Ze to go with her to Sun Zhang Xing\u2019s home, to ask about the Mount Xian Teng matter.Sun Zhang Xing\u2019s family are outsiders, so they don\u2019t have any fields, only two or three meager acres of land; they\u2019re even poorer than the Lian Family. They lived in a thatched shed, so you can imagine the situation at home.But what made Lian Fang Zhou admire most, is that the Sun Zhang Xing couple gritted their teeth as they stopped spending money on clothes and food to let their only son, who is 13-years-old, Sun Ming be sent to the county\u2019s school to study. She heard that his results aren\u2019t bad and is expected to be one of the five in the school to pass and become a scholar.It is also because the couple needs to pay a lot of money each year; so that\u2019s why they were always unable to buy fertile land. Sun Zhang Xing has also taken the risk in entering Mount Xian Teng again and again.When Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze arrived, the couple was sitting down at the shabby table for supper.On the table was an unknown dish, a small dish of dark pickles and two bowls of thin sweet potato porridge. The couple sat opposite of each other.Lian Fang Zhou smiled and called, \u201cUncle Sun, Aunt Sun,\u201d when she entered. Sun Zhang Xing and his wife Mrs Miao were stunned.He replied with an \u201cAh!\u201d and wiped his mouth. He was a bit surprised as he stood up, smiling he said, \u201cIs this not Fang Zhou and Ah Ze? You have come to\u2013\u201cSun Zhang Xing is an outsider, and towards all the villagers, he is particularly polite. But because he lived at the village edge, he doesn\u2019t have many exchanges with the villagers.At the moment, he was racking his brain but he still couldn\u2019t think of when exactly he had contact with the Lian Family siblings?His questioning eyes could not help but look to his wife, \u201cyou called them over?\u201dMrs Miao was also puzzled and lightly shook her head at him.Sun Zhang Xing then laughed as he faced them and Mrs Miao also greeted with a smile. \u201cOur family is too simple, we let you see in such an embarrassing way!\u201d (ED/N: Dang these people are too nice, our MC just walked into their house while they were eating and were still courteous towards her.)\u201cUncle Sun, Aunt Sun is too polite! It\u2019s actually us disturbing your dinnertime! You should eat first, wait until later to talk, by then it won\u2019t be too late!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou apologetically smiled and sat down at the side with Lian Ze.Sun Zhang Xing don\u2019t know why they come, so how could they keep eating? So he smiled, \u201cNo problem, no problem, you speak, speak first!\u201dLian Fang Zhou could see his confusion and straightforwardly open her mouth and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s like this, we would like to know when Uncle Sun is going to Mount Xian Teng. We are thinking of going with Uncle Sun for one trip.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Sun Zhang Xing and Mrs Miao eyes opened wide, they were stunned.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Sun Zhang Xing said in surprise. \u201cYou want to go to Mount Xian Teng? For what?\u201dHis tone suddenly carried a hint of wariness. Could these siblings also want to go hunting? In fact, how would they have the skills to? Or do they want to follow him to split the hunt for nothing \u2026 \u2026That cannot do, it\u2019s not enough for his family!\u201cOf course hunting, we can\u2019t do, that area is Uncle Sun\u2019s ability!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled as she said, \u201cwe just want to see if there are mushroom and the like in the mountains; to get some for the New Year. \u201cShe added, \u201cOur family\u2019s situation, you also know \u2026 \u2026\u201dSun Zhang Xing and Mrs Miao could not help but look at each other, the two\u2019s hearts could not help but soften a little.Although the two family\u2019s specific circumstances are not the same, there is a saying that happy families would all be happy, while unhappy families would each have their own misfortunes.They both belonged to the unhappy type. It is said that those with same illness sympathize with each other; Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s words, it was naturally easy to arouse their sympathy.Sun Zhang Xing gently sighed, and was about to promise, when Mrs Miao\u2019s heart jumped, hurriedly she said, \u201cHow can this be allowed? Fang Zhou, you siblings are still so small, on such long mountain roads, will you be able to bear it? And, it\u2019s too dangerous! \u201cMrs Miao said as she winked at her husband again and again.What if something happened to the siblings? Their family is an outsider, they originally had to tuck their tails as they lived, how can they ask for more trouble for themselves?Sun Zhang Xing immediately understood the meaning of his wife, just when he \u201chehe\u201d as he tried to refuse, Lian Fang Zhou rushed to say, \u201cUncle Sun, Aunt Sun, in fact, we just want Uncle Sun to take us to recognize the roads only. Us siblings aren\u2019t naive children; when we arrive there, would we run around just to get into trouble? And, it\u2019s just this time, this time only! Right, wait a moment!\u201dLian Fang Zhou said as she turned around to go out and got the melon scoop of rice that was at the doorway. The so-called melon scoop, is an old musk melon that has been cut into two from the middle and hollowed out on the inside of the flesh; it could be used to scoop water and other things.\u201cWe siblings were embarrassed to let Uncle Sun lead the way for nothing, after all on that Mount Xian Teng we are not familiar with it. We have to invite Uncle Sun to talk about what we should pay attention to on the road, where we can go and not go! This bit of rice is a tribute, I hope Uncle Sun and Aunt Sun won\u2019t reject it \u00a0\u2026 \u201d Lian Fang Zhou shyly smiled.Sun Zhang Xing and Mrs Miao saw that scoop of rice and could not help but light up their eyes.To those with no paddy fields, rice is the most expensive and rare. To see the rice made them feel more moved to the point it made their eyes light up and their hearts jump. Even more than it would see money. This is was a desire, a pursuit of desire.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25-26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCHAPTER 25 + 26translate by Maggie edited by Marci25. Chapters 25 Opportunity gotten by sacrificeMrs Miao secretly speculated that this scoop of rice should be at least four jin(or 4x500g) or it could have also been five jin(2.5kg). Mixed with vegetables, sweet potatoes and the like, it\u2019s enough for the couple to eat for the next two weeks.Only leading the way, and you can get this much rice. Only a fool wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201cHow about this,\u201d Mrs Miao thought for a bit: \u201cTomorrow, I will make a trip to your uncle and aunt\u2019s home with the both of you in order to let them know. After all, it\u2019s such a long trip, and you\u2019ll be heading into a large forest. It\u2019s better to let the adults at home know.Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze looked at each other. Neither of them thought that Mrs Miao would say that.They knew Mrs Miao\u2019s intention about greeting the adults to obtain consent. In case anything happened, they can explain everything clearly.Lian Fang Zhou could understand Mrs Miao\u2019s misgivings.However, this was uncle and aunt; needing to give greeting to that couple, this \u2013Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t know what to say.It must be mentioned that although the siblings and the couple are not on friendly terms with each other as Lian Li and Mrs Qiao bully them fiercely, outsiders don\u2019t catch a wind of it. This is because after all, their quarrels never broke out into public.But even so, the fact is Lian Li and Mrs Qiao can\u2019t be considered as their elders \u2013 at least the siblings don\u2019t treat them as elders.If they had the appearance of elders, then when the Hua Family came several times to bully them, they would have stood up to protect them or at least said a single fair word.To have these kinds of people, that happen to be their \u201celders\u201d in the eyes of outsiders, make decisions for them? Lian Fang Zhou could only snort in her heart.Lian Ze became anxious, just when he was about to speak, Lian Fang Zhou lightly pulled his sleeve. She nodded and smiled as she said, \u201cGreat, then Aunt Sun tomorrow call on me, and we\u2019ll go to my aunt\u2019s to let them know.\u201dLian Fang Zhou had readily agreed.\u201cOK, then now it\u2019s settled!\u201d Mrs Miao felt slightly relieved, and also candidly smiled as she nodded.Sun Zhang Xing then said, \u201cYou really did come at a good time. The day after tomorrow, if the weather is good, I was planning to go on a trip to forest!\u201d\u201cReally? That\u2019s really great! Our luck isn\u2019t bad!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s eyes lit up as she spoke.\u201cHaha, who says it isn\u2019t!\u201d Sun Zhang Xing also started laughing.Seeing that matters have been discussed, Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze took their leave.Lian Fang Zhou left the rice behind with reluctance.Mrs Miao was joyful at first, followed by a little hesitation and said, \u201cThis \u2013 not right, your aunt, we don\u2019t know if she will agree or not to let you go \u2026 \u2026\u201d\u201cHow would she not agree!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled, using a carefree tone and said, \u201cUncle Sun isn\u2019t an untrustworthy person, and us siblings are not without sense, so how could aunt disagree!\u201d \u201dLian Fang Zhou without any explanation, gently rested the melon scoop on the table, saying \u201cPut it here for now!\u201d\u201cHaha, then \u2026 \u2026 Haha!\u201d Mrs Miao rubbed her hands; her words of refusal were pushed back into her throat, as she became a bit speechless.Lian Fang Zhou also did not give her the opportunity. She smiled as she took her leave, pulling Lian Ze along.\u201cSister.\u201d On the road, Lian Ze worriedly asked, \u201cWould Aunt really agree? She treats us -\u201dLian Fang Zhou thought about it thoroughly, and coldly said, \u201cThat is why she\u2019ll agree, Hmph, possibly in her heart she\u2019ll wish something will happen to us in the middle of it!\u201dLian Ze\u2019s chest tightened, his face changing a bit. His eyes looking at Lian Fang Zhou expressed his emotions quite clearly, what if \u2013\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Lian Fang Zhou faintly smiled toward him, saying \u201cWe will definitely come back perfectly fine!\u201dHe did not know why, but when Lian Ze heard her tone filled with certainty and saw her faint mood, his heart settled down.\u201cI believe in my sister,\u201d he said softly.Just like Lian Fang Zhou expected, the next day she and Mrs Miao knocked on the door of Lian Li\u2019s home. She pleasantly smiled as she talked about this matter to Mrs Qiao. Mrs Qiao was surprised for a moment, and then gently harrumphed. With neither a salty nor bland tone, she replied, \u201cWhere you go to is your own business. Do as you like. Everything is fine and you come and ask me for what? \u201dMrs Miao wanted to say something, but Lian Fang Zhou already interjected, \u201cSince Aunt said this then we don\u2019t have worry.Rest assured! Aunt Sun, let\u2019s go!\u201dMrs Miao froze; then she suddenly thought of some rumors she occasionally heard, and coupled with the lack of sleep she had after they so happily accepted the rice last night, she half-heartedly let Lian Fang Zhou pull her away.Anyway she has greeted the elders of the Lian Family!Mrs Miao thought in her heart.Because the next day they had to walk along such a long mountain road, that day Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze didn\u2019t go anywhere and stayed at home to rest. Lian Zhou also instructed Lian Che and Lian Fang Qing how they should be at home.The next day, when it was still not bright outside, Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze had already gotten up.After opening the door, the morning cold chill blew in, seeping into their bone marrow. They hastily started the fire, ate something, and took the sacks they prepared last night for the outing.Yesterday Lian Fang Zhou asked Sun Zhang Xing, what kind of things did they need to bring, such as dry food, water and the like?Sun Zhang Xing unrestrainedly waved his hand, answering \u201cNo need! The mountains have the cleanest spring water. And during this season, there\u2019s a lot of wild fruit; mountain herbs aren\u2019t scarce. What need is there to carry dry food?\u201dEven with that being said, Lian Fang Zhou still felt afraid that, since it\u2019s the first time the siblings are going unlike Sun Zhang Xing, not eating something to suppress the hunger, might inhibit them from carrying on.Coupled with the fact that the two of them weren\u2019t familiar with Mount Xian Teng and still needed to ask Sun Zhang Xing a lot, in order to prevent his impatience, they gotta bribe is that not right?There is a way to make people\u2019s mouth soft by eating. Lian Fang Zhou doesn\u2019t believe that after eating their family\u2019s food, he won\u2019t answer their questions.As a result, she gritted her teeth and made five boiled eggs, and used bamboo leaves to wrap three rice dumplings up. She left two eggs for Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che. Then she carefully packed the remaining three and the rest of the rice dumplings in a clean cloth.Before going out of the house, Lian Fang Zhou gently woke up Lian Che and Lian Fang Qing and said a few words. Afterwards, she went out together with Lian Ze.These two children were lovable. Even with half-squinting sleepy eyes, they still knew to say 'sister and second brother come back early.\u201dAt the east, the white color of fish belly have yet to appear; the dark blue sky was so blue that it was exceptionally clear, with a clean desertedness stars that seemed to be suspended in the ice.In the sky, one star looked particularly bright. That was the morning star.The siblings used the weak starlight to go to the village entrance where Sun Zhang Xing\u2019s home was located. From afar they could see his house with a dim light shining within the hut.\u201cUncle Sun!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze happily greeted him as they stepped forward.\u201cOh, you have come!\u201d Sun Zhang Xing laughed with a \u2018haha\u2019 and gave them a nod, saying \u201cI was just talking about it, and you came! Let\u2019s go. We\u2019ll set off!\u201d26.Mount Xian Teng\u201cEn,\u201d Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze smiled as they agreed. The two, sister and brother, felt the excitement and curiosity of exploring new things, as well as, joy in their hearts.\u201cBe careful on the road! And come back early!\u201d Mrs Miao waved at them.Sun Zhang Xing turned back and said. \u201cEn, I know! You go back now! The day\u2019s still early; go back to sleep!\u201dMrs Miao did not respond to his words and yelled, \u201cTake care of Fang Zhou and her brother!\u201d\u201cI know. Don\u2019t worry,\u201d Sun Zhang Xing said.After they walked far away and reached a bend, Lian Fang Zhou subconsciously looked back, and could faintly see Mrs Miao still standing there, looking over in their direction. In the cool night, she looked so lonely and frail.Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s heart felt a little bit pained. She couldn\u2019t help but think about how all year round, there are many days that Uncle Sun goes hunting and how Aunt Sun\u2019s share of waiting in torment also isn\u2019t little.In the end, it\u2019s because of being too poor, ah!Sun Zhang Xing was very familiar with the mountain road, but he still hasn\u2019t entered the mountains. There was a large number of people on this road, what\u2019s more is that it\u2019s also flat and not difficult to walk on. Therefore, it is not difficult for Lian FangZhou and Lian Ze to keep up with him.Sun Zhang Xing is also a kind-hearted person. Because he felt that his own family received so much rice, not taking care of them, could not be justified. So he was very patient from time to time reminding them of their steps on the road and did not once go as he liked.Gradually dawn arrived, and the morning star hanging high above the sky gradually faded. At the East appeared the white fishbelly. The road beneath their feet can already be seen clearly, and so the three sped up their pace.After walking for about half an hour later, Sun Zhang Xing turned around and smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s take a break here. In a while we won\u2019t get to rest. There\u2019s still two more ridges too! If you\u2019re tired, just say it and we\u2019ll stop to take a break. Traveling through the mountain road needs one burst of energy. If we rest the legs they\u2019ll become soft, then it will only be more and more harder to walk!Both Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze nodded, smiling as they said alright and gave their thanks again.Sun Zhang Xing pointed to the side said, \u201cDown that the slope, there\u2019s a spring. If you\u2019re thirsty, you can go drink a few mouthfuls of it!Lian Fang Zhou then laughed. \u201cI was going to ask Uncle Sun if there\u2019s any place I could get a drink around here!\u201d Then she stood up.Lian Ze also said he wanted to go, so the siblings went over together.After resting more than a few minutes, the three continued travelling.The sky was getting brighter, and thin faint rays appeared at the east sky. It is expected that it won\u2019t be long until the sun comes out.At this moment, without having to concentrate on her foothold on the road, Lian Fang Zhou took the opportunity to ask Sun Zhang Xing various things about Mount Xian Teng.Originally, she was worried that Sun Zhang Xing wouldn\u2019t be willing to tell her anything. Who knew that he was a talkative person. It just happened to be a good way to pass time on the road, so he endlessly chatted with the siblings.The two siblings from time to time asked questions, which made Sun Zhang Xing more and more interested in them. In the end, the three of them did not feel tired as they travelled.After about an hour, they finally reached the foot of mount Xian Teng.In fact, when they gradually got closer to Mount Xian Teng, both sides of the forest seemed to be a lot taller; vegetation also seemed to be more lush. On both sides of the mountain, the forest obviously didn\u2019t look the same as the ones they previously saw. They were more towering, tall and broad.\u201cI have to go into the woods to see if my luck is good and if i can hunt some good stuff! You two don\u2019t go too far. If you lose your way, then you\u2019re in trouble! In case you can not find the way back, remember to go find streams in the mountain and follow the direction of flow to leave the forest! When entering the mountain, it\u2019s best to follow along the stream, well like that one right there. Doing it this way will be better! Around shen hour(3-5pm), let\u2019s meet up here, and we can head back together. You better not be late!\u201dSun Zhang Xing solemnly said.Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze quickly agreed. Lian Fang Zhou smiled and took out the egg and rice dumpling, handing them to Sun Zhang Xing. \u201cWe brought some food, just a little bit of our gratitude. Uncle Sun we hope you won\u2019t refuse!\u201dSun Zhang Xing originally wanted to decline, but hearing Lian Fang Zhou say this, declining would be a bit too hypocritical. He generously accepted and smiled. \u201cThank you. Thank you both! Well, I have to go first! This is the time to hunt, and time flies. In the twinkling of an eye, one day will be over! \u201dThe siblings bid him farewell.\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s eat something, then we\u2019ll go after a while!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou said.\u201cEn!\u201d Lian Ze nodded. The two sat down as they ate the eggs and rice dumplings. They rolled up leaves to scoop the nearby mountain spring water to drink.\u201cSister, do you think we can find mushrooms?\u201d Lian Ze looked up and observed the gloomy big forest that looked as if it could open its mouth, waiting for people to send themselves in. His heart thumped like drums.\u201cLet\u2019s try it first! Since we came, we can\u2019t go back empty handed ah!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou laughed.Lian Ze also grinned and nodded. His heart was originally thumping, but since Sister wasn\u2019t afraid, and since he is a man, what is there to be afraid of?When they had eaten, they sat down again in the time it takes to make tea. Then, according to what Sun Zhang Xing said, they walked along the direction of the stream into the forest.They just needed to remember the location of the stream, so going a little further from the riverside also isn\u2019t a problem.The two walked into the forest, reaching the tall trees which are rushing toward the sky. Below the trees that had lush vines climbing and wrapping around their trunks, the area was filled with a variety of short grass and shrubs, lots of whose names aren\u2019t really known.. It looked pretty, but walking through the vegetation was difficult.Perhaps since normally no one came to this place, the mushrooms were plentiful. Because numerous trees fell down and a long period of time had passed with no one to deal with those fallen trees, they began to decay, covered with moss and wrapped with vines.And these kinds of rotten wood are the best place for mushroom to grow.The siblings were extremely delighted.\u201cSis, can these be picked?\u201d Although Lian Ze was filled with excitement until his eyes shone, he did not forget to ask Lian Fang Zhou first.Lian Fang Zhou could not help but be secretly delighted in her heart. First, she took a good look and then pointed out to him how to pick them.This forest did not only have mushrooms, but it held various types of mushrooms . Just with a glance, she could see that there\u2019s ectomycorrhizal, Morchella, wild shiitake, wild jelly ear, and Russula. Lian Fang Zhou also found some Tremella fuciformis and Boletus edulis. It made her overjoyed. She carefully harvested them.This place has an abundance of mushrooms, so in less than an hour, the two Lian siblings already filled the four sacks they brought with them.They tied the sacks tightly and picked up an appropriate branch from the forest to use as the pole. Each carried two sacks out of the woods. They came to the place where they separated from Sun Zhang Xing and set the sacks down on the grass.Fortunately, the mushrooms weren\u2019t heavy, but they could not be squeezed to minimize the space they took up. Although the sacks were loaded to the top, in fact they weren\u2019t heavy.The two took a break for a while. Seeing that the day was still early, Lian Ze said that he wanted to go to the stream to see if there are any fish. Lian Fang Zhou went with him.This terrain was more leveled, so the stream of water was also more gentle. The width of stream was two meters or so. They can see through the crystal clear water, and at the bottom were large chunks of dark stones.The edge of the stream was full of coin-size wild chrysanthemum. A touch of purplish blue petals wrapped the golden stamens. At first glance, it grew along the river to no end, dazzling people\u2019s eyes.Perhaps because it was daytime, the stream was too clear. It has fishes, but the thin small fish were the size of pinky finger or a chopstick. Schools of fish swam here and there, but there were no big fish.However, under the large stones, there are thumb-sized freshwater shrimp.They carefully removed the stones. Then saw hard-shelled, almost transparent shrimp waving their long pair of claws. With their thumb and index finger, they pinched the backs of the shrimp, gently holding them and pulling them out of the water. The pair of slender pliers waved around as their bodies struggled.\u201cSister, such big shrimp and also this many. Really rare!\u201d Lian Ze excitedly laughed. \u201cWe can catch more to bring back!\u201d\u201cGood! Tonight we\u2019ll have something good to eat again!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou is also delighted.The river next to the village also has shrimp, but no big shrimp like these. Just small ones about an inch long. Its body was the size of a green bean or a soya bean. Those kinds of shrimp can be caught only using a special net. The locals called them 'shrimp twist.\u201d. This is because there\u2019s no way of catching them, not because they can\u2019t catch enough. Then people would get exhausted after fishing for half-day and would still not be able to catch enough for a break.Both sister and brother were overjoyed to catch such big freshwater shrimp. Each shrimp that came from under the stones were thrown to the shore. The feeling of watching them jump under the sun was incomparable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Anymore then we can\u2019t carry it. Let\u2019s come again tomorrow. And catch some more again!\u201dLian Ze thought about it, this forest still have plenty more mushrooms inside! Moreover, they didn\u2019t go elsewhere to explore. So when they look around, there will definitely be more mushrooms \u2026 \u2026 So, certainly need to come again.This time didn\u2019t need Lian Fang Zhou talk,. Lian Ze was no longer reluctant to come.People tend to be afraid of the unknown. But once they witnessed, they will then know it\u2019s not like that. Lian Ze\u2019s mood at this time is just like that.\u201cSister, there\u2019s wild banana over there. I\u2019ll pick some leaves to these shrimp wrap!\u201d Lian Ze pointed above the stream.Lian Fang Zhou followed where he pointed, it really has a cluster of four or five wild banana tree not far from in front, growing tall and small. But not too high, looks about two meters. Then said: \u201cThen you quickly go. I\u2019ll pack up these shrimp!\u201dFor a moment, Lian Ze pluck the banana leaves. The two then wrapped up the green shrimp they caught. Lian Fang Zhou weighed, look like about two or three jin. Then grinned: \u201cUnfortunately, if only we had a bucket, then it\u2019ll be great!\u201dThis far, it is clearly impossible.But the her now, have no qualification to be picky about living shrimp and dead shrimp. What\u2019s more, these mountain of wild shrimps, since it was brought from this far away, the taste should be good, right?\u201cBucket? How can we do that! So bulky!\u201d Lian Ze was surprise and said with eyes wide open. He was shocked by what his sister said!Lian Fang Zhou froze. Only then remembered this era doesn\u2019t have light plastic buckets. At home were wooden barrels, aren\u2019t they so bulky!Imagine carrying a wooden barrel going all this way. She could\u2019nt stop herself from laughing. Laughed: \u201cIt\u2019s sister being muddled head! Look at what I\u2019m saying\u201dLian Ze also laughed, at same time also relieved. Scratching his head, he grinned: \u201cSister scared me for a moment!\u201dAt this time, the sun just pass after noon. From the time, Sun Zhang Xing said when he come back is still a long time away. On the way here, he said not far in the east, there were a wild date forest, bear a lot of fruit. Near the north edge of date forest were yam vine. They can pick some dates and dig some yam to roast with fire to eat.The two took a break for a while, then went according to the direction Sun Zhang Xing pointed to.Sure enough, that wild date forest has around twenty to thirty trees of various size. Some still small, did not fruition. Those that bear fruit, the fruit completely encrusted on branches. A mass of dark red dates covered the whole trees.When they just arrived the forest edge, they smell a hint of fresh date fragance blowing by.\u201cSo many dates!\u201d Lian Ze was joyful, busily pluck several of those big and red ones. And then ran over to hand over to Lian Fang Zhou. Raised a smile: \u201cSister!\u201dLian Fang Zhou smiled as she took them. Casually wiped it, then took a bite. Once enter mouth was crisp, sweet and juicy. She nodded her head toward him, smiled: \u201cThe taste is really good too!\u201cLet\u2019s pick some to bring back! Qing er and Che er will love them as well!\u201d Lian Ze grinned as he said. No matter what kind of good thing, he never forget those two little ones.Naturally Lian Fang Zhou has no comments. Just smiled and said: \u201cToday, take a bit less. Tomorrow we\u2019ll need to come anyway!\u201dLian Ze was stunned: \u201cTomorrow still come?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou nodded without hesitation, said: \u201cSince we already know the way. Tomorrow it\u2019s fine to come by ourselves. Don\u2019t need come this early. Pick mushrooms and then we can go back! Take advantage of these days good weather, and gather a lot of mushrooms, bring back home to sun-dry. Not only can we leave some to make some dishes for ourselves to eat, and also sell some for some money to help some family expenses!\u201dThe ten liang silver from dissolving engagement couldn\u2019t be help but be spent ah. Repairing the roof has already used up some. And the things need to buy are plentiful!\u201cWhat Sister said is right!\u201d Lian Ze nodded.This date tree full of fruit, so the weight cause the branches to be heavy. The siblings picked them to eat while talking. And soon they didn\u2019t feel hungry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Was busier than I thought I would be T.TEdited by MarciThe road back is not too far away, and also having to carry the two bags of mushrooms, that is strenuous work ah.So Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze still looked for a few yams to dig out.These were real wild yams, a bit flat and twisted in some places probably because it grew around a piece of rock, making it deformed.Each were about 2 or 3 fingers wide. The big ones were half an arm long, while the short ones were palm sized neither neat nor too regularly shaped.However, it doesn\u2019t matter e if they taste really delicious after being roasted.From the cracks of the yams, a warm aroma spread. Inside them looked as white as snow. When eaten, they were powdery and waxy (kinda like mashed potato), whetting one\u2019s appetite.This is authentic natural wild food, not to mention Lian Fang Zhou, it also garnered Lian Ze\u2019s never-ending praise as he ate.Then, the two dug out three or four more yams, cleaned them with water and got some leaves to wrap them to bring back as an ingredient for cooking.Full and satisfied, they noticed it was almost time to leave. So the two of them decided not to go anywhere and rest to maintain their physical strength. They chose a place without sunshine to sit down and rest.The autumn afternoon\u2019s rays warmly shone on their bodies. From time to time, an autumn breeze blew by, making the leaves rustle. The two people grew a little tired, and unconsciously drifted to sleep, until they were woken up by Sun Zhang Xing.They rubbed their eyes as they burst into laughter and greeted Sun Zhang Xing with a few words. They saw Sun Zhang Xing shouldered strings of colorful feathers from a pheasant. There were also two fat hares. The two could not help feel envious. They grinned as they said, \u201cUncle Sun harvested a lot today ah!\u201dWho knew that Sun Zhang Xing would give a wry smile, and lightly sighed replying, \u201cJust some small things, not worth much!\u201d\u201cThose still aren\u2019t worth much! How could that be!\u201d Lian Ze exclaimed with surprise.Sun Zhang Xing just laughed responding, \u201cDo not worry about it! We\u2019re not near the city from here or else the city\u2019s restaurants will want a lot of them. So, you can only sell these to landlord Zhou, Assistant Minister Zhu, Master Zhao, and other major families. All of them know that no one else will buy these besides them. And when I keep for ourselves, I can\u2019t scratch it (meaning-don\u2019t have the heart to eat them), so the price isn\u2019t high! Unless I hunt mountain otters, gray martens, squirrels, deer and the like, the fur can be worth some money. A large goat or a wild boar, will also be worth even more money! Of course, we often don\u2019t have that kind of luck.\u201dSun Zhang Xing looked slightly vexed as he explained, so Lian Fang Zhou knew that he told the truth. He was neither being perfunctory with the two siblings, nor pretending to complain.Originally, Lian Fang Zhou had also became somewhat confused; having such a large forest is equal to an endless treasure trove. Why is Sun Zhang Xing, who has wandered here to hunt for so many years, still so poor?Today, she finally understood.He doesn\u2019t recognise the value of the mountain\u2019s resources. He only knew how to hunt,so it was as if half of the treasure became wasted.And when hunting just having the tool is not enough, you still need luck and time.If you do not hit valuable prey, then naturally your harvest will not be worth as much. But most of the large beasts lived deep in the forest, so no matter how good Sun Zhang Xing\u2019s skills were with a bow and arrow, he still did not dare to go further inside alone.And this forest is so vast and full of countless dangers \u2013 especially in the evening, so he could only come in the morning and return home in the afternoon. With just that amount of time, how much opportunity would he have to hunt for valuable things? Many hunters enter the mountains, staying for good few days or even ten days.No wonder that even when the day has yet to brighten, he has to hurriedly depart to the forest. But this way of fighting for time, in fact only earns an effectiveness that is almost equal to zero.After thinking for a short period of time, Lian Fang Zhou completely understood the situation.She could not help but look at Sun Zhang Xing with sympathy.Sun Zhang Xing just inadvertently glanced over, just happening to meet Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s eyes. He could not help, but freeze for a second, before immediately shifting his eyes away. His heart felt slightly a bit unhappy; what did he do to make a little girl feel sympathetic?He didn\u2019t mingle around that badly, right?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Chapter 28 DinnerLian Fang Zhou thought about her blunder, suddenly feeling a bit embarrassed.She coughed once and then laughed. Afterwards, she lightly grinned at Sun Zhang Xing. \u201cUncle Sun, there\u2019s something I want to ask. Please don\u2019t be angry!\u201d\u201cIf there\u2019s something, ask!\u201d Sun Zhang Xing froze.Lian Fang Zhou then blandly said, \u201cI don\u2019t know when Uncle Sun goes hunting every time, ah, but what if you send some game to the judge\u2019s house?\u201dSun Zhang Xing abruptly looked at Lian Fang Zhou, feeling surprised with his eyes wide open.\u201cFang Zhou, thank you for telling me!\u201d Sun Zhang Xing immediately understood Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s meaning as he embarrassingly smiled. Secretly, he felt ashamed in his heart; even a little girl knows this logical reasoning, How could he be so muddled head!The judge serves as the village official. The position may not be grand, but it held real power. The sale of land, the collection of crops tax, and the responsibilities of resolving neighborhood disputes, settling household registration, opening road guide, establishing various official requirements on proof, etc., are all managed by him!At least, going through him is necessary for the first step.Sun Zhang Xing and his wife lived at the edge of the village. Normally, they upheld the belief of having less matters rather than more, so basically they made sure not to mingle with the village people. Over time, they become more and more isolated.Not only do they have no connections in the village, but no one would think of informing them about whatever matters that happen in the village.In fact, several times a few households wanted to sell their paddy fields, and sometimes the prices weren\u2019t bad. If they grit their teeth, Sun Zhang Xing and his wife could still buy two acres.Unfortunately, when they came to know about it, the new owner has already sowed the field. Sun Zhang Xing could only silently regret and envy other people\u2019s luck.They can only wait until next time. And this \u201cnext time\u201d really means forever.But if they have a good relationship with the judge, then it is not the same. At least if there\u2019s something, the judge would give them a heads up. When it is time to give allowance, they will give more allowance once or twice, rather than always being indifferent and separating business from personal life.\u201cOh, Uncle Sun these words of gratitude I dare not accept!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled.So, the atmosphere suddenly got more lively. On the way back, Sun Zhang Hang took the initiative to talk a lot about the Mount Xian Teng matter to Lian Fang Zhou and her sibling.Gradually they got out of the mountains. The mountain range did not carry a type of unapproachable atmosphere, and crops also began to appear from afar. There were also more footprints on the road.Now they\u2019re near home. The three people gently sighed in relief, and their hearts relaxed.Home is always the dock of the harbor, especially after exhausting themselves for the whole day.\u201cI have to go to Shang village to see if Landlord Zhou needs anything and also to go ask several other people, so we\u2019re not taking the same road. You siblings go back first then!\u201d At the fork of the road, Sun Zhang Zhang stopped.Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze naturally didn\u2019t have any objections. The two parties said their goodbye.Sun Zhang Xing then took two spotted feathered chickens that hung from his shoulder. One is worth around 4 liang or so. While handing them over to Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze, Sun Zhang Xing became somewhat embarrassed as he laughed, \u201cTake these back with you to have a taste! Ah, today\u2019s luck wasn\u2019t great. If it was better, I would give you some more\u2026 \u2026 \u201dAlthough the chickens weren\u2019t large, but the meat was very delicious and fresh. Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze, already feeling delighted, hurried to smile as they gave their thanks.Lian Ze hung the two chickens at one end of the pole. The more he looked at them, the more he love them and could not help but talk to Lian Fang Zhou with envy saying, \u201cIt\u2019ll be great if could hunt like Uncle Sun. There\u2019s endless amount of game to be caught! If I could do it as well, that\u2019ll be good! Sister, what do you say if I ask Uncle Sun to accept me as his disciple and teach me archery? Will he accept?\u201dLian Fang Zhou glanced at him and laughed. \u201cYou think about things too simply! Although he can hunt, if hunting is an essential means of making a living, then it\u2019s not as good as you thought it would be or else how can you see Uncle Sun\u2019s home in that state? If there\u2019s paddy field and a stable living, he certainly wouldn\u2019t want to go hunting! You want him to accept you as his disciple? Forget about it! This is his ability to survive. How could it be so easily taught to you?\u201dLian Ze suddenly lost his energy and silently sighed out. \u201cA pity!\u201dLian Fang Zhou laughed. \u201cThe mountain is full of beasts, wandering here and there. It is very dangerous. Even if he is willing to accept you, I can\u2019t help but worry! So we better not think of that. We\u2019ll decently live our days!\u201dLian Fang Zhou believes that with her own knowledge of agriculture, their lives will definitely get better and better, and she does not want Lian Ze to have wild thoughts and become a hunter \u2013 having it as an occasional pastime is fine, but being like Sun Zhang Xing is too hard!The two talked all the way back without noticing time passing by quickly.At this time, night has already fallen. The horizon of the sunset displayed only a thin afterglow, an unusually gorgeous orange hue.\u201cSister! Second brother!\u201dIn the distant village under a big locust tree, two small figures happily shouted, flying toward them as they ran. They didn\u2019t need ask to know who they were.The two siblings(LFZ&LZ) looked at each other and laughed. Their hearts warmed up a little.Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che ran to the two of them, completely panting. Their eyes looked exceptionally clear and bright.\u201cSister, second brother, you\u2019re finally back. We waited for so long!\u201d Lian Fang Qing tugged Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s dress, as her little face raised up with a smile.\u201cRest assured Sister, the front door is locked! Two old hens were also penned!\u201d Lian Che also added.\u201cGood, good!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou laughed. \u201cYou both are good children, but next time best obediently wait at home. Don\u2019t come out around this time, since it\u2019s cold in evening!\u201dWhile they laughed and talked, they showed them the big and red dates, which were very very sweet, and also the large shrimps, as well as the spotted chickens, the mushrooms and yam. Tonight, there\u2019s plenty of delicious things!Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che were overjoyed. The four people\u2019s happy laughter spread as they walked all the way home.When they reached home, Lian Fang Zhou took those dates out and let the two little ones wash them for everyone to eat. Sweet dates entered their mouth, making Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che delighted. The two of them didn\u2019t forget their brother and sister and brought it to them to eat, so Lian Fang Zhou was completely moved.After a short break, the four started getting busy.Lian Fang Zhou spread the mushrooms on the clean ground, letting Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che sorted them out, picking out those that were crushed. Then, she went to the kitchen with Lian Ze to make dinner.Tonight\u2019s dishes were quite lavish. The two chicken\u2019s feathers were plucked and were then washed. Using a knife, she cut each into four pieces, and together with fresh mushrooms she made a stew.Simultaneously, she boiled the large shrimp in clear water, while simply frying the slice yams!Originally, Lian Fang Zhou was prepared to deep-fry the big shrimp, but she can\u2019t waste oil ah, so they can only be boiled. There was rather a lot of shrimp. Therefore tonight they\u2019ll only eat half, then after dinner she plans to use a small fire to slowly evaporate the water in the rest, , leaving them tomorrow for Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che to eat. This is because tomorrow they still have to go back to the Mount Xian Teng.The four siblings have not eaten such a lavish dinner for such a long time, so when the stewed chicken and mushrooms\u2019 aroma permeated throughout the house, the four couldn\u2019t help their eyes lighting up. They looked at each other and burst out laughing.At the same time as she laughed, Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s heart secretly felt ashamed; she\u2019s almost a thirty-year-old person, but she can actually be gluttonous like a child.After a splendid dinner, the bones and shrimp skins were collected to be used to feed the chickens tomorrow. When hens eat a lot of shrimp, they will lay more eggs.After dinner, the four continued to sort the mushrooms, while Lian Che suddenly said,\u201cAh, my sister, I forgot to tell you that sister Ah Juan came over to our house and said that Aunt Zhang was looking for you!\u201d\u201cAunt Zhang was looking for me? I\u2019ll go over then!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou stood up and washed her hands, heading over to Aunt Zhang\u2019s.Initially, she wanted to bring some fresh mushrooms and yams to give Aunt Zhang, but then after thinking about it, when the time comes Aunt Zhang and others will definitely ask where did these come from, and if they heard that they went to Mount Xian Teng, they will certainly discourage them from going again.Lian Fang Zhou was neither willing to refute their kindness nor willing to give up Mount Xian Teng. Also, she did not want the people in the village to know that they went there. After thinking about it, she decided that it would be better not bring them for now and wait until after they collected enough mushroom to sell for money. Then, she can buy some gifts for them as a long overdue thank you gift.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She just wanted to say that tomorrow she\u2019ll be making a trip to the county city, so she asked her if she want to go together?Of course Lian Fang Zhou wanted to go, but she had more important things to do, so she could only say \u201cnext time\u201d!\u201cAunt Zhang, I can\u2019t go tomorrow,\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled and said, \u201cCan I trouble Aunt Zhang to help me buy some things?\u201dAunt Zhang did not ask why she\u2019s could not go but frankly nodded and grinned. \u201cJust speak, what do you need to buy, Aunt Zhang ah, promises to buy them while being both of good quality and cheap for you!\u201dThat being said, and both of them burst out laughing.Actually, Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t have any other things to buy, just the hemp paper for the window, some cloth to make clothes, and a pair of shoes for everyone at home.The others are fine, but when Aunt Zhang heard her mention buying shoes, Aunt Zhang glared at her, saying \u201cYou girl, using money is like being on the knife\u2019s blade, there can\u2019t be big hands big feet (meaning loosely handing out money)! What need is there to buy shoes? Isn\u2019t it fine to make them yourselves? There\u2019s plenty of things that money will be needed to be spent on in the future! You can\u2019t be so wasteful! Such a coincidence that I also have to make shoes, so when the time comes, I\u2019ll request for more leftover cloth from the tailor shop\u2019s master. When I\u2019m back, I\u2019ll give you some. I guarantee there will be enough for you. You just need to buy a pack of inner soles and do some needlework!\u201d\u201cAunt Zhang, I \u2026\u201d For a moment, Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t speak.Aunt Zhang talking like this and not treating her like outsider, made her very grateful, grateful from the bottom of her heart. But damn, she doesn\u2019t know how to make shoes ah!Whatever inner soles were, she had never seen them before ah!She hadn\u2019t even seen the simple ancient chinese commoner clothing style, so when the time comes, she\u2019ll invite the village aunt or sister who are good at their work to help give pointers and it\u2019ll be fine. Otherwise, she can\u2019t even make clothes ah.Only the thought that the original Lian Fang Zhou could do it, so for a moment she did not know what to say.\u201cOh!\u201d Aunt Zhang gently sighed and said in \u2018such a pity\u2019 tone: \u201cNo wonder you said it like that. Qing er is still small; you, one person having to manage the family, and also having to work on the field, definitely won\u2019t have much time to make shoes! Let\u2019s not mention anything else, just the inner sole is a lot of work na!\u201dLian Fang Zhou mentally sighed out in relief. Although Aunt Zhang misunderstood, such a misunderstanding is what she was begging for!So she smiled and was about to speak \u2013Who knew that Aunt Zhang continue on and said, \u201cHow about this! Ah Juan and I will help you with the soles! And when you\u2019re free, just stick the front on and it\u2019s done \u2013 Ah, you\u2019re not allowed to decline! That\u2019s how it\u2019ll be settled! \u201dSince Aunt Zhang said it like this, Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t really say any words of rejection, so she only nodded and agreed, giving her thanks.The next day after breakfast, using a dustpan Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze spread out the mushroom which were picked yesterday, left at the front to sun-dry and told Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che to watch the house. If it is going to rain, they had to bring the mushroom into the house; as the sun moves, also move them a bit.The two of them then went to Mount Xian Teng again.Sun Zhang Xing went really early to get more time to hunt. They don\u2019t need to hunt and the mountains have plenty of mushrooms, so they don\u2019t need to go out too early.There were seven-eight consecutive days of good weather, so the two siblings went to Mount Xian Teng every day. Every day they brought back four large bags of mushrooms looking like groundhogs as they transported them home.Due to walking and exploring the mountains frequently, they also became a lot more familiar with it. Their courage also grew, and, the scope of the activities they completed widened.The two sibling\u2019s luck was good; later on, they found a lot of Tremella fuciformis, as well as some precious Porcino and Hericium erinaceus. But, they also accidentally found a tremendous amount of Tuber fleeceflower. These are good stuff, making Lian Fang Zhou feel overjoyed.The two also caught a good amount of river shrimp. Three fingers big fish can also be seen occasionally, but this wild fish is very sneaky and slippery with its streamlined-like body shape and ability to move lightning fast in the water. Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze crept around, before they could catch this fish, it already flashed to another place!They just have to give up.But with one whole noon, the two caught a palm-sized turtle. The turtle was lying on the shore rock under the sun and easy fell into their hands. They intended to take it home for Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che play with.In the mountains, wild fruits were countless. In addition to those small jujube trees, there were many mountain chestnuts, pear, wild persimmon, mountain grapes, rose myrtle fruit, another kind of jujube, Elaeagnus fruit, etc., so much that it dazzled the two.But unfortunately, home was too far away or else they could bring the two little siblings together to play.However, the two chose some fruits each day to take back, so it was a good surprise for Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che.Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t want people to know that they went to the Mount Xian Teng, so they told Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che that those wild fruits could only be eaten at home and could not be brought out.Since the death of their father and mother, the four siblings\u2019 life became bleak, as they suffered a good bit of bullying. The children of the village, whenever they have something delicious or fun, would deliberately and triumphantly show off in the front of Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che.Lian Fang Qing was once angered until she cried. Now it was her turn to have something good, but Lian Fang Qing with great difficulty managed to hold back the impulse to take it out .Continuously going out for these many days, Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze were tired, and they already gathered a lot of mushrooms. Lian Fang Zhou intends to go to the county city to sell them and have a look at the market before deciding.This way, re-gathering can also have a comparison \u2013 of course, picking those with value to gather!Not long afterward, the weather cooled down. Once the frost hit, it will be difficult for mushrooms to grow, then there won\u2019t be any mushrooms that can be picked.The first batch that was brought back has been dried, they just gathered ones that need another two or three days to dry completely. Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze already discussed that they would rest two or three days at home, and then go.In the vegetable patch, the seeds that were sprinkled before have long already sprouted. Every evening, Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze will carry two big buckets of water to water the plants at once. Those vegetables not only grew fast, but were also moist and tender.These two day, there\u2019s fresh green vegetables to eat at home, and then another few days, she can transplant some. There\u2019s also that turned green pepper, can also plucked.Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s heart thumped, she felt that they should send some to Aunt Zhang\u2019s family. She specifically selected some of the best vegetables and plucked two peppers.Although it isn\u2019t worth much, nothing beats freshness \u2013 at this time other people have not started to sow seeds and pepper has already been long dead.When Mrs Zhao saw the fresh vegetables and the tender green pepper, her eyes brightened. She happily thanked her, took them, and could not help but say, \u201cThis is really rare na! At this time sowing, wouldn\u2019t the seedlings grow moldy? There also peppers, how could there be fresh ones in this season? Fang Zhou how did you do it?\u201dThis small matter, of course, Lian Fang Zhou wouldn\u2019t keep it private. She then laughed and grinned. \u201cRapeseed can be sprinkled, but the ground must be treated first with ash and mixed well into the soil. You need to use the ready made ash, which were hogweed that was cut off from the mountains and were burned. Do not use the ones from the stove! Sister may not know it, that this pepper after coming to fruition looked like a lost case, but I just loosened the soil, and then fertilize it. Doing so will allow it to bear fruit once again. The second time isn\u2019t as much as the first time, just this big!\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s like that! I\u2019ll also try it next year!\u201d Mrs Zhao grinned as she nodded and remembered.Lian Fang Zhou laughed: \u201cOur garden pepper plant has a lot of fruit; if sister likes them, in two days I can send some over!\u201dMrs Zhao felt overjoyed and continuously gave her thanks.Aunt Zhang saw her daughter-in-law like this and could not help but secretly sigh, then could not help but laug.h \u201cAlright Fang Zhou, you ah, are this thoughtful, so sending once is enough. No need to send again! Leave them for yourselves! If you can\u2019t eat them all, leave them to turn red and pick them to be sun dried, or make chili sauce! That way the stuff won\u2019t go bad!\u201dLian Fang Zhou: \u201cAunt Zhang, almost every time you say that I regard you as outsider, now your words really regard me as outsider! Whatever your family has something to eat, don\u2019t you think of me? Sister, later I will sent them over. Do not worry!\u201dMrs Zhao froze, then laughed. Originally hearing her mother saying it like this, she was also somewhat embarrassed and unhappy. This time she also very happily answered \u201cGreat!\u201d And smiled saying, \u201cAlmost forgot, yesterday we just opened an old pumpkin. Wait a bit; I\u2019ll cut a piece for you! Bring it back home and cook some pumpkin rice, or fry some or add water to stew. It\u2019s really sweet!\u201dLian Fang Zhou gave her thanks and then stood there waiting.Aunt Zhang, who heard her say it like this, feeling like she better not say anymore courteous words again, also laughed.Thinking about it, whatever they own, they give more to them!Mrs Zhao cut a piece of old pumpkin out and cheerfully handed it to Lian Fang Zhou. Lian Fang Zhou gave her thanks again and took her leave.At this time, she saw Li Juan coming in from the outside, while she saw Lian Fang Zhou causing her eyes to flash as she said, \u201cFang Zhou, Fang Zhou! Your family\u2019s Third Aunt came back, and at your uncle and aunt\u2019s home she\u2019s causing a stir at this moment!

After stirring trouble at Uncle and Aunt\u2019s place, would she come over to her home for a turn?Aunt Zhang let out a sound of amazement, hurriedly asked Li Juan: \u201cXiao Man is back? Why did she come back at this time?\u201dAunt Zhang saw that the sky is already dark and misty.\u201cI also don\u2019t know.\u201d Li Juan thought about it, said: \u201cAnyway, this time she is making a very big stir! Second Uncle Lian and Aunt Qiao, they won\u2019t allow Xiao Man to enter the house door. So Xiao Man sat at the entrance crying and yelling, insulting them too! A lot of people are watching\u2026(ie. viewing and gossiping/commenting) Oh yeah, Aunt Qiao also won\u2019t let Xiao Man in and to go to Fang Zhou\u2019s house, saying their house will definitely not take her in!\u201dHearing this, Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s heart sank, seems like whatever this Third Aunt is, she isn\u2019t someone to be trifled with. Mrs Qiao that guy, no good things come out of her mouth! What if Third Aunt really went to her home, then what should she do!\u2019Lian Fang Zhou was a bit agitated and couldn\u2019t stay standing, she better rush back and see! She hastily said a few words and hurried back home.Aunt Zhang asked Li Juan a bit more, however Li Juan didn\u2019t know a lot, so she couldn\u2019t get much information.Aunt Zhang sighed \u201cXiao Man is also difficult to deal with, it could be said that she is fifty to eighty percent like the Lian Family\u2019s couple! Oh, if she really did go to Fang Zhou\u2019s house\u2013,oh really pitiful children!\u201dAt the side, Mrs Zhao couldn\u2019t help curling her lips, grinning \u201cMother, you worry too much! The current Fang Zhou isn\u2019t easy to bully! Think about time with that Hua Family\u2019s daughter-in-law. Without Fang Zhou\u2019s agreement, I bet, no matter how Xiao Man was forceful, she wouldn\u2019t be able to enter their (Fang Zhou\u2019s) home door! However I feel that the Fang Zhou now is a lot better then before, hehe!\u201d\u201cWhat do you know!\u201d Aunt Zhang glared at Mrs Zhao, mentally saying \u2018you say and feel that the Fang Zhou now is good because now she give you gifts? You ah\u2026are just so short-sighted!\u2019How could you understand? Lian Xiao Man isn\u2019t Hua Family\u2019s daughter-in-law, she\u2019s the Fang Zhou\u2019s and her siblings\u2019 legitimate-related Third Aunt, (Basically she is the legitimate related third aunt of Lian Fang Zhou and her siblings generation\u2026Must be their father\u2019s third oldest in family sister with same mother and father so she is called legitimate) which makes her (TA) an elder!\u2026 Even if she (TA) is in the wrong (TLN: can\u2019t find the right word for the phrase but this is the closest), she\u2019s still the elder!<Could be because she\u2019s an elder she won\u2019t be punished even though she\u2019s wrong>Driving an elder out the door, suffering people\u2019s denouncement is unavoidable! In this village, perhaps there\u2019ll be some people saying crude words! Especially the Hua Family, so how could they let go of this opportunity?If like this, Fang Zhou\u2019s name will definitely be damaged, not only her, the four siblings reputation will suffer. In future it will affect their marriage! (TLN: not exactly the marriage but the getting married part)But, that Lian Xiao Man isn\u2019t someone good, if the siblings let her in the house, being bullied by her is unavoidable? There\u2019s a possibility of those hard earned money to be scammed away by her.Ah, this matter really is-\u201cThat can\u2019t do, I better go have a look!\u201d the more Aunt Zhang thought about, the more she worries. She finally couldn\u2019t endure it and stopped whatever she was working on and went out.Even though this matter is hard to deal with, if she is by the side watching, at the right time she could help say a few words. Not letting the siblings suffer.Aunt Zhang hastily rushed to Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s house. With a look, she only finds Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che at home. Lian Che was at the kitchen watching the fire for dinner.She couldn\u2019t help stare blankly, quickly she asked Lian Fang Qing in the central room \u201cGirl, where\u2019s your sister and brother?\u201dLian Fang Qing was giggling and called out \u2018Aunt Zhang\u2019. Hearing Aunt Zhang ask her, she replied: \u201cMy sister and second brother went to aunt\u2019s place, let me and third brother stay at home!\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d Aunt Zhang was surprised, her face changed.Lian Fang Qing was a bit puzzled ,saying \u201cThey just went over ah!\u201d\u201cOh no!\u201d Aunt Zhang stomp her feet, not want to talk to her (LFQ) anymore and hurriedly headed over to where Lian Fang Zhou was.Her heart couldn\u2019t help secretly be anxious and complained \u2018this girl, what is she actually planning! At this time she should wait to avoid trouble, why did it become like this? Reversed and sending herself up?! Is this for real?!\u2019Aunt Zhang didn\u2019t know that Lian Fang Zhou have her own plan.After she (LFZ) hastily returned from Aunt Zhang\u2019s house, she couldn\u2019t bother with the other problem, and first ask Lian Ze about this Third Aunt person.Lian Ze blanked for a second then told her in detail and was puzzled that out of nowhere she(LFZ) asked about her(TA)?The more she hear about Third Aunt the more Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s brow frowned, never thought that this Third Aunt is also troublesome and a difficult character.Selfish, petty, harsh mouth\u2026Especially hearing that her husband is no longer in this world and her relationship with her (TA) mother-in-law and sister-in-law isn\u2019t very good, made Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s brow creased even tighter\u2026\u2026So to speak, if Mrs Qiao set on the idea of not letting her in, 7-8 out of 10 she will come to her home.To her own family, she (TA) is an elder ah! If she (LFZ) shut her out the door, that would be unfilial ah! In this era, no one dare carry the unfilial hat. Even Lian Fang Zhou, who isn\u2019t afraid of heaven or earth, wouldn\u2019t dare.Once the unfilial hat is fasten on, then \u2018that\u2019s the real end!\u2019Not only her, her siblings would also be affected. If by chance offended a vile person, then Lian Che\u2019s school matters may possibly fall apart.But, rather than being made to wait for Third Aunt to come knocking on the door, wouldn\u2019t taking the initiative to find her Third Aunt, be a better value? At least her family will gain a good reputation, and also Third Aunt would owe her debt of gratitude.This way, she could more or less control the situation a bit, otherwise wouldn\u2019t it be that, what she(TA) says would be what it is?Lian Fang Zhou would never let any other person come to her home and put an appearance of an elder, wanting to be the head of house making decisions.This house\u2019s master is her,only she could protect the siblings. In midst of thinking, without hesitation she pulled Lian Ze out of the door, straight over to Lian Li\u2019s house.Aunt Zhang rushed to nothing at Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s house, turned around to anxiously rush over to Lian Li\u2019s house. She\u2019s afraid that the two siblings would be at a disadvantage ah!When Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze arrived, the Qiao couple and Lian Xiao Man was in midst of a terrible row (fighting).They could only see Mrs Qiao both hands on hips blocking the yard\u2019s entrance, Lian Li standing behind Mrs Qiao acting as back up, and Lian Xiao Man fallen down sitting on the ground lamenting to heaven and knock her head on earth(means wailing her woe). Dozen to twenty villagers stood around pointing.Only to hear Mrs Qiao loudly say \u201cOnce a girl married off, it is like pouring water out of a basin, your man is dead, then you should guard him, serve your father-in-law and mother-in-law well, that\u2019s what you should be doing! What\u2019s with running back to maternal home? If we take you in, then we are harming you! And also, our Ah Hai is still at the County Town Academy studying, he\u2019s studying for scholar, in future will study for Juren(those who pass imperial exams)! You shamelessly running back, will implicate our family principles, how could we be worthy of and not let down Ah Hai? Hmph! Today no matter what you say, this old lady won\u2019t let you in, so kill off that desire!\u201dLian Xiao Man didn\u2019t even bother with her (MQ) and just powerfully slapped the ground, crying about deceased parents,crying about her life is bitter, crying about how elder brother treated her in the past when she was little, pressuring Lian Li \u201cElder Brother, right or wrong, you should say something! I\u2019m your blood-related sister! How could you be so heartless! After my man passed away, left or right, mother-in-law isn\u2019t pleased with me, brother-in-law and sister-in-law bully me! I didn\u2019t say I\u2019ll stay and wouldn\u2019t leave, just staying over a few days and ask brother to help me say a few fair words. Or is this not possible for elder brother? Even heartlessly not bothering with your own blood-related sister, you still dare say family principles or not! This is a crooked, evil wind! Thoroughly crooked!\u201d(TLN- family principles= \u95e8\u98ce(door wind), crooked wind=\u6b6a\u98ce, a little play on word. Lian Xiao Man is swapping door for crooked)Everyone around started to whisper and point, some said Lian Li is in the wrong, also some said Lian Xiao Man is in the wrong.Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze silently stood at the outer edge listening.From the words within the speech, Lian Fang Zhou could hear a lot of information, like at the start how arrogant Lian Xiao Man was when her husband was alive. She looked down on brother and sister-in-law and now suffering hardship because she can\u2019t do anything and can\u2019t resent them for not helping her and the likes of her.Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t stop her smile from sprouting, this really is men said man have reason and women said woman have reason( means there is much to be said on both sides)!Lian Li copied Lian Xiao Man, also pretend didn\u2019t hear anything.Mrs Qiao became incoherent with rage after hearing her, couldn\u2019t endure turning into an old almanac (guess she\u2019s going through the memory lane) and start giving out. Lian Xiao Man couldn\u2019t accept and argue back.The more both side row, the more each other\u2019s rage grew, Lian Xiao Man was really angry, pointedly yelling \u201cYou hussy purposely stirring up trouble, I\u2019ll fight it out with you!\u201d She then suddenly stood up and ram into Mrs Qiao with her head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Some people in the crowd gently laughing.How could Mrs Qiao simply let it go after suffering this? With wild anger, it only took one push for her, (Mrs Qiao) to shove Lian Li away. Yelling \u201cYou dare hit me? What do you think you are to dare to throw a fit at my door!\u201d She rushed towards Lian Xiao Man.The two sister-in-laws\u2019 twisted together, hitting as well as cursing. The two\u2019s momentum was too fierce, everyone was stunned for a moment, when they came back around, they hurried to pull apart the two to mediate.The two was like \u2018you pull my hair, I\u2019ll pull your clothes collar\u2019. Everyone pulled for a good while before they could separate the two. The two was still fiercely staring at each other with red eyes, panting as they insult each other endlessly, clothes were a mess, hair was dishevelled. Both were in dire strait and ferocious.Lian Fang Zhou looked towards them, nearly bursting out in fits of laughter, the word \u2018shrew\u2019 is simply the vivid portrayal of the situation in front. Lian Xiao Man screamed and cried out \u2018father and mother\u2019 again, as she started crying. Mrs Qiao cursed non-stop, for a period of time it was uneventful.\u201cOur Lian Family\u2019s Eldest, you should say something! Letting them stir trouble like this is hardly presentable!\u201d No one knew who in the crowd called out.\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right!\u201d Everyone else echoed.Lian Li\u2019s brows lightly pinched up, unhappily swept a glance at the direction which the voice sounded out, blaming the person that was being so nosy.In all fairness, of course she (Mrs Qiao) isn\u2019t willing to let Lian Xiao Man stay.Because after Lian Xiao Man\u2019s man died, it was already, not the first time she returned to her family. Every time she returned, she shamelessly doesn\u2019t want to leave, this time, she arrived when the day has nearly darken, Lian Li mentally guessed that she definitely stirred up some trouble at her husband\u2019s family again, and this time, there\u2019s a possibility of staying even longer, and may even shamelessly not leave!Of course Lian Li wouldn\u2019t let her stay. The person who just called was very loud, even if Lian Li want to pretend he didn\u2019t hear anything is a bit difficult. So he frowned so deep that it was even more unsightly. Only he was sluggish and had yet to come forward to respond, he sees Lian Fang Zhou pulling Lian Ze over them, pass through the crowd and abruptly came up front.The siblings came to Lian Xiao Man\u2019s front, Lian Fang Zhou reached out and supported her (Xiao Man), calling out, \u201cThird Aunt!\u201dThis was out of the blue, so everyone was shocked. Including Lian Xiao Man herself. Lian Li was secretly relieved, the foot that was raised was gently put back. Aunt Zhang has also just arrived at this time, and also froze when she saw this situation.\u201cThird Aunt, since Uncle and Aunt refuse to take you in, then you come to our place! I am willing to take you in.\u201d Lian Fang Zhou grasped Lian Xiao Man\u2019s hand, her word were very gentle, but the meaning was completely straightforward. Moreover, she used the word \u201ctake in\u201d, that is saying she, Lian Fang Zhou is the owner.Aunt Zhang heard what she said, she then understood her intention, couldn\u2019t help but to praise Fang Zhou with \u2018Brilliance\u2019\u2019, Aunt Zhang made up her mind help her (Fang Zhou) in a while. Everyone never thought that Lian Fang Zhou was this generous, so numerous discussion of praise emerge.Lian Fang Zhou lightly smiled as she said, \u201cIt\u2019s what should be done!\u201d And no longer speaked more. Mrs Qiao wasn\u2019t happy. She felt that Lian Fang Zhou \u2018did it on purpose\u2019, intentionally using this to ridicule her, make her look bad \u2013 or else why did she come now to take in Lian Xiao Man? Not wait for everyone to disperse then say it?Although Mrs Qiao couldn\u2019t accept it at heart, but it isn\u2019t good to open her mouth, once she open her mouth, it would seem like she is fighting with Lian Fang Zhou to keep Lian Xiao Man, she certainly won\u2019t do that!On Lian Li\u2019s side, he already breathe out a sigh of relief as he called out \u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right! You go over to Fang Zhou\u2019s home! We are also doing it for your good! Fang Zhou\u2019s home got a big bundle of food, how much would four children eat? No worries with one more person! Unlike us, every day we got to count the amount to cook, oh, we have no other way, Ah Hai\u2019s study need money! Why need to suffer with us.\u201dLian Li explaining like this, was good as it points out his own difficulties, it seems like they can\u2019t take in Lian Xiao Man cause of predicament, at once it made the people\u2019s feeling of disgust lessen a lot. After all, whose family doesn\u2019t place their child as the most important thing? Pity all the parents\u2019 heart ah!(Means \u2013 Parents tend to worry about their children.)But Lian Xiao Man snorted again and again, facing the ground as she fiercely spat a mouthful, glaring at Lian Lin \u201cIf you really thought like that I also wouldn\u2019t have blame you, you should have told me clearly from the start! Why didn\u2019t you say so from the start, but you had to wait for Fang Zhou came, wait til she open her mouth first, then you say that? What do you mean doing for my own good? Only seeing Fang Zhou say like this so you can happily say such generous words! Those that doesn\u2019t know would really think you are something good! Hmph, being a bitch still want to set up an arch, is talking your kind of goods!\u201d\u201cYou -\u201d Lian Li didn\u2019t expect Lian Xiao Man to not give him face, in front of his face she said such ugly words, it made him so angry that his face flushed. Within the crowd, some could not endure and gently started laughing. Although Lian Xiao Man\u2019s words was harsh, everyone thought about it and felt it was really reasonable.Afraid that before Lian Fang Zhou came, those two would want to stop Lian Xiao Man and not allow her into the door, not allowing her to take any advantage of their family, how is it really thinking for her own good? If they really thinking for her own good, then at least let her into the room, sit down and slowly discuss, even if they haven\u2019t yet think of Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s place!No one would be cold and ruthless to block the door, then turned around and get some ready-made advantage, saying it\u2019s for their sake! Everyone talked about the Lian Li couple, as a person, they can\u2019t help but be even more shameless.When hearing Lian Li say that, the two Lian siblings (Fang Zhou and Ah Ze) stared at each other, eyes saying \u2018so nauseating\u2019, didn\u2019t expect that Lian Xiao Man, without hesitation talk about them in reverse, Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t help but secretly laugh, and suddenly felt that it isn\u2019t bad to take in this Third Aunt. At least from now on, there\u2019s someone to deal with the detestable Uncle and Aunt.She\u2019s the lower generation, so when doing these kind of things a lot isn\u2019t good, even if in reason, but Third Aunt isn\u2019t the same!Originally hearing her husband say it like this, her heart was also full of joy, secretly saying that husband can really talk. Who knew her happiness has yet to warm up, it was fiercely smashed. Mrs Qiao felt a mix of anger and embarrassment, sharply yelling \u201cReally kindness come to no good. In this age, being a good person is hard! At the start, we want to explain it clearly, but you come up crying and throwing a tantrum without stop, how could we open our mouth? Good words were exhausted by you! Your kind of woman, with your man dead and not being well-behaved and stay at your in-law\u2019s house, still have the face to yell at people? Can\u2019t believe you can open your mouth! It\u2019s you who\u2019s the bitch, a bitch who can\u2019t behave!\u201d\u201cHussy, I\u2019ll rip your mouth!\u201d Lian Xiao Man was enraged, eyes go red as she glared at Mrs Qiao and rushed over again to go all out on her.Mrs Qiao\u2019s eyes also go red, swore: \u201cBitch!\u201dThe two struggled as they want to break away and hold the other to give blows. Everyone hurried to pull and numerous mouth tried to persuade. Lian Fang Zhou frowned, looking at Lian Xiao Man, that face full of grief and about to cry but unwaveringly endured, she couldn\u2019t help but start to feel some pity and loathe Mrs Qiao even more.As the saying goes, when insulting, don\u2019t disclose people\u2019s shortcoming. Lian Xiao Man is a widow, this identity can easily cause trouble. In this era, widow causing trouble where she can\u2019t explain even with a hundred mouth can cause death. Once Mrs Qiao opened her mouth it arrived, such vicious motive.\u201cAunt! Third Aunt!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou suddenly loudly screamed. This sudden melodious scream startled everyone, including the red eyes Lian Xiao Man and Mrs. Ma (typo by author-should be Qiao), who were like cock fighting.Suddenly it was silent, so quiet you can hear a pin drop, not even one sound was made.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We\u2019re all one family, what is the point! Third Aunt, let\u2019s go!\u201dLian Fang Zhou deeply breathed in and calmly spoke.\u201cNeed you\u2013\u201d Mrs Qiao rolled her eyes at Lian Fang Zhou, in midst of saying \u2018Need you to so nosy,\u201d Lian Li glared at her, so she suddenly regained her wits, hurriedly shut up and changed to a heavy harrumph. Lian Xiao Man also gave a deadly look at her, quiet cold laugh\u2013 that was a really cold laugh, it made people\u2019s body feel a slight shiver.\u201cWhat Fang Zhou said is right, everyone disperse now!\u201d Lian Li loudly called out.Lian Fang Zhou silently curled her lips in disdain; some people really don\u2019t know how thick their skin is (means shameless), he still have the guts to open his mouth. At this time, everyone regained their wits, and one after another start discussing. However the content of discussion changed: Lian Family\u2019s girl, \u2018how great she is!\u2019. One after another, everyone dispersed.Mrs Qiao was angered with Lian Fang Zhou \u2014 She is set on believing that Lian Fang Zhou purposely waited until she (Mrs Qiao), her husband (Lian Li) and Lian Xiao Man fight til no reconciliation point can happen and then came over, purposely letting them make a fool of themselves and show her goodness.In addition to Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s loud shout from a moment ago, clearly that shout included her, and a strange coincidence, she actually listened to her shout and stopped arguing with Lian Xiao Man, doesn\u2019t this mean she, Mrs Qiao listens to Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s words? How could that do!Mrs Qiao directed her anger on Lian Fang Zhou (kind of like holding hatred but switch with rage).She knows Lian Xiao Man\u2019s nature very well, so she purposely said this words loudly \u201cNiece Fang Zhou, you siblings have had no family head for so long, now you happen to bring back your Third Aunt, so the family finance or whatever problems crop up, you have an elder to make decisions! Or else it won\u2019t be right!\u201dLian Fang Zhou was originally pondering on how to clearly state that Third Aunt is a guest in front of everyone, otherwise in future Lian Xiao Man may possibly do something where it isn\u2019t right for her to talk. Hearing Mrs Qiao\u2019s words meet her desire.Lian Fang Zhou politely said in a loud voice: \u201cAunt, those words aren\u2019t reasonable! How could you corrupt Third Aunt\u2019s reputation? Third Aunt has Third Aunt\u2019s family, to run over to the maternal family to become the family\u2019s decision maker? What are you making people think of her? How would they see Lian Family? Does that mean in future after Lian family\u2019s daughter marry out, they then run back to the maternal home to become the family head? What would that become! Third Aunt is an understanding person and absolutely won\u2019t be muddled-head like you.\u201dAunt Zhang has already came forward to help Lian Fang Zhou, to support Lian Xiao Man, hearing these words she also nodded her head and said:\u201dWhat Fang Zhou said is reasonable! There has never been such married daughter not watching their reputations matter! Mrs (or sister-in-law) if you prefer Qiao shouldn\u2019t say that!\u201dEveryone also nodded, agreed, and said Mrs Qiao is in the wrong.Especially those women with sister-in-law\u2019s (husband\u2019s sister) in the family; if in the future each family\u2019s sister-in-law start having this intention, for no reason to run over the maternal family to boss around, who would be able to put up with it?Mrs Qiao just sneered, but didn\u2019t answer. She knows she doesn\u2019t need to say anything because she know Lian Xiao Man\u2019s nature very clearly!Lian Xiao Man heard Mrs Qiao\u2019s word and her heart was moved: Even in her dreams she want to become the family head once. Unfortunately, her man died, this life she, the daughter-in-law can\u2019t become an experienced old woman (experience the hardship of running the household)! Of course no longer having the chance of becoming the family head. Isn\u2019t there a good opportunity in front of eyes now? Because of Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s words, it created a slight feeling of displeasure in her heart.She didn\u2019t let it go into her heart (means didn\u2019t take it seriously), because she didn\u2019t place any importance on the four siblings. In her opinion, since Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze obediently took the initiative to run over to collect her, then in future, whatever she said, would they disobey?Lian Xiao Man faced the ground and spat again, coldly harrumphed: \u201cShe\u2019s just wants to drive a wedge between us. Especially because her intention are up to no good! Let\u2019s go!\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou nodded her head. The two siblings, Lian Xiao Man and Aunt Zhang left together. Anyway what she wanted to say is already said. If this Third Aunt really wants to be a troublemaking moth, then don\u2019t blame her for \u2018changing face and not recognise her\u2019 (This phrase means forget all previous interaction and give no respect or consideration)Once entered the yard, Third Aunt saw the repaired like new house, tidied up neatly yard and her eyes lit up, happily commented: \u201cNot bad, not bad. This house really isn\u2019t bad!\u201dLian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze stared at each other, Lian Ze\u2019s brow slightly tighten, Lian Fang Zhou signalled him not be impatient. Lain Ze didn\u2019t say anything and just cast down his eyes.\u201cI won\u2019t go in, still have stuff to do when I go back!\u201d Aunt Zhang saw the situation and mentally sighed. This Lian Xiao Man really is \u2018scars heal, forget the pain\u2019 type. Not a single thanks was said and once entered, she stared at the house. Pitiful siblings, why have such a bitter life!However in other difficulties, Aunt Zhang could help out, but this is Lian Family\u2019s family matter. So even if Aunt Zhang have the heart to, she could only stand by and do nothing. No matter what era, sticking into other people\u2019s family is a taboo.\u201cAunt Zhang, take care!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou gratefully smiled toward Aunt Zhang, then toward Lian Xiao Man, she politely said: \u201cThird Aunt, can you help send off Aunt Zhang!\u201dAunt Zhang originally wanted to say \u201cNo need\u201d, but saw Lian Fang Zhou giving her the eye, then held her tongue. Lian Xiao Man\u2019s brows was slightly wrinkled, obviously showing a not very willing expression. Lian Fang Zhou, a younger generation actually ordered her, this made her extremely uncomfortable.However she is an elder, and Aunt Zhang did help out today. She, the elder need to give her thanks to her, personally sending her is fitting right? Lian Fang Zhou and her siblings are all kids, letting them go forward is a bit lacking in manner.Thinking like this, did Lian Xiao Man felt somewhat better, smiled as she went to the yard as she send off Aunt Zhang as she was told to. But her heart still felt a bit unhappy. This Aunt Zhang, really don\u2019t know where her chatter come from, talked with her for a good while before she actually left. Only then did Lian Xiao Man let out a breathe, hurriedly turned around to go in.When she returned to room, dinner were already on the table. When saying dinner, it was actually just a pot of pumpkin rice. Lian Che saw that her sister and brother haven\u2019t returned after so long and the sky has nearly darkened, then decided to wash the pumpkin Lian Fang Zhou brought back and put in the rice to cook. At this time it was already cooked.\u201cThird Aunt, please come have dinner!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou saw her (Xiao Man) entering and smiled. Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s tone was very polite. But because it was too polite, Lian Xiao Man felt unhappy instead, she then grinned: \u201cHey, we\u2019re all one family, why be polite! In future, no need to treat each other as strangers!\u201dLian Fang Zhou glanced at her, still very polite as she gave a slight smile: \u201cThis isn\u2019t the problem of treating as stranger or not. Even though we are one family but you are Aunt (GuNaiNai- this aunt means married daughter).\u201d Aunt still counts as a guest. Lian Xiao Man saw herself, neither soft or hard attempts meet Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s two nails. She felt even more displeased in her heart, however she knew she obviously can\u2019t take advantage of Lian Fang Zhou by speech. So she smiled and no longer spoke as she went forward.Seeing the table of five bowls of pumpkin rice, Lian Xiao Man frowned and said: \u201cAiya, how could it do just eating these? You are all in your growing period, should be eating more good thing! Fang Zhou, go to kitchen again and make another two dishes, Ah Ze you help with the fire!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lian Ze lowered his head with an indifferent face, pretending he didn\u2019t hear anything. He couldn\u2019t help lift his complaining eyes to look at his sister: Sister is really muddled-headed, why did you take the initiative to bring back this trouble.Lian Fang Zhou sneered inwardly, but not one bit was obvious on her face, treating as if Lian Xiao Man didn\u2019t say anything at all. She picked up her chopsticks without a care, then grinned toward her siblings: \u201cIt\u2019ll be cold in a moment, so quickly eat it while it\u2019s hot.\u201dOnly then did she smiled toward Lian Xiao Man. In a steady tone, she said: \u201cThird Aunt, this is what our family has always been eating, so made Third Aunt suffer. Anyhow Third Aunt you could endure today, then tomorrow, how about Lian Ze and I send you back?\u201dLian Xiao Man\u2019s expression changed, face slightly sunk: \u201cWhat are you saying? Driving me away?\u201dHer eyes turned, mouth just opened to start crying \u201cAiya\u2014\u201c, when Lian Fang Zhou coldly called out \u201cThird Aunt!\u201d Making her(Xiao Man) stop suddenly.Lian Xiao Man was never someone with little guts. But don\u2019t know why, Lian Fang Zhou at this time, make her a bit scared for some reason.\u201cI am an elder!\u201d Lian Xiao Man strengthened herself and she bolstered her courage as she coldly harrumphed.\u201cI didn\u2019t say you weren\u2019t,\u201d Lian Fang Zhou blandly said: \u201cI also didn\u2019t say driving you out, but you are a married off aunt, your husband\u2019s family is your home. You won\u2019t deny this, right? Since you aren\u2019t used to my house\u2019s food, so is there something to pick at when I say sending you back? You, an elder, need us, younger generations to take care of you, hmph, still have the heart to be picky! I will ask your husband\u2019s family, can it be that they the Tian Family doesn\u2019t feed their own daughter-in-law, forcing the daughter-in-law to return to the maternal family to rely on still kids nephew and nieces to be taken care of?\u201d\u201cYou\u2013\u201d Lian Xiao Man\u2019s face paled, didn\u2019t dare say anything anymore.If she was staying at Lian Li\u2019s home, taking care of her for a while is reasonable, since Lian Li is her brother. Even if taking her over to in-law family to talk, it\u2019s both side\u2019s arguments, just seeing whose mouth is better at talking.But now she\u2019s staying at Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s, then everything\u2019s different.If Tian Family let their own daughter-in-law return to maternal home leech off her orphaned nephews and nieces, then Tian Family\u2019s back[1] will definitely be broken by someone! Then their reputation would be ruined.In order to avoid getting back breaking, Tian Family will force her to return, and after returning\u2013Lian Xiao Man was startled as well as afraid, for a while her anger dissipated\u201cFang Zhou, Great Aunt said the wrong thing, don\u2019t be angry!\u201d Lian Xiao Man hurriedly put on a smiling face, apologetically smiled: \u201cI won\u2019t say it anymore! I\u2019ll stay together with you, and can help with managing the household!\u201dHelp them manage the household? Lian Fang Zhou nearly laughed!She doesn\u2019t what kind of person her own deceased father was like, would it be like Big Uncle and Third Aunt? Considering these two were deserved to be called siblings.\u201cIf Third Aunt wants to stay, then stay. As to managing the household, no need to trouble Third Aunt! Our family has me as the family head!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou bluntly refused.\u201cYou\u2019re a child, what would you know! Unless you don\u2019t trust Third Aunt?\u201d Lian Xiao Man was the kind that wouldn\u2019t turn around after hitting a wall unless she lost half her life then she\u2019ll turn around.Lian Fang Zhou thought can I even trust you?Of course, she can\u2019t say this out loud, she glossed over it: \u201cIn the end, Third Aunt doesn\u2019t count as our family member anymore, sooner or later will have to return! So don\u2019t need to be this problematic! If Third Aunt doesn\u2019t feel satisfied or unhappy, you could leave tomorrow!\u201d\u201cNo, no!\u201d Lian Xiao Man\u2019s face changed when leaving was mentioned. She quickly begged: \u201cFang Zhou, everyone in that house hate me to death and torment me. I can\u2019t go back there! You also saw how your Uncle and Aunt treat me like a foe. They won\u2019t give me justice and say some fair words. I have no husband or maternal family to count on. Going back means sending myself to death! I, I won\u2019t mention about the matter of being the family head, alright? Fang Zhou, you can\u2019t drive me out!\u201dHearing her say it that tragically, Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t help have some pity. She(Xiao Man) as a person is really detestable, can see that her mouth is fierce, and have some presumptuous cleverness[2], deep down she\u2019s not a bad person\u2014 also need what it takes to be bad.Just like she said, driving her out is sending her to death. Thinking about it, her days weren\u2019t good, even though it wasn\u2019t as severe as she said it was. And there\u2019s nothing bad having one elder in the house.Another thing, one sentence Mrs. Qiao said right, there\u2019s enough food to eat now. And having her (Xiao Man) look after the two little ones, she herself can free up more effort to focus on other matters.Lian Fang Zhou has already made up her mind, but still with an expressionless face, said: \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t cause trouble, you can stay Third Aunt. What we eat, is what you eat, anyway, we won\u2019t treat you bad. But you also have to do some housework. If you\u2019re willing, then stay. If not, tomorrow, we\u2019ll send you back!\u201dLian Xiao Man felt a burst of vexation, and thought, aren\u2019t you telling me to stay as an old maid? She wanted to disagree in a fit of pique, but also afraid that Lian Fang Zhou would really send her back tomorrow. When thinking about her husband\u2019s family situation, she weighed up the two side and she finally reluctantly nodded in agreement.The two smaller ones were young and ingenuous, didn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on, however, Lian Ze was relieved.\u201cThen that\u2019s fine!\u201d Lain Fang Zhou also slightly smiled, and said: \u201cQuickly eat, if not it\u2019ll be cold!\u201dLian Xiao Man didn\u2019t dare be picky again and started eating with them.At night, when going to bed, the sisters and Lian Xiao Man shared one room. Luckily the original partition wasn\u2019t taken down, so Lian Xiao Man slept in the inner one and the two sisters slept in the outer.Lian Xiao Man quietly mumbled: \u201cThis house is a bit small. It would be better to build a bigger one!\u201dJust finished speaking, Lian Fang Zhou glanced over. She then shut up.The second day, starting from the morning, Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t let Lian Xiao Man be idle. Made her help with meals, washing the clothes, tidy up the room and rest. Lian Xiao Man dare not butt head with her (Fang Zhou), so could only stomach her anger.From time to time, she deeply sighed and sulkily hammered her waist, pretending to be tired. Lian Fang Zhou just act as if she didn\u2019t see and ignore her. Lian Xiao Man was pissed, however, couldn\u2019t do anything to Lian Fang Zhou and only honestly endure.The mushrooms were already sun-dried, so Lian Fang Zhou planned to go to the market the next day. Since the road is really long and there\u2019s a lot that needed to be brought, Lian Fang Zhou spent 15 coppers to rent a donkey cart from Uncle Wang in the village.Hearing about going into county town tomorrow, Lian Fang Qing was so excited and wanted to go. However Lian Che sensibly held her back: \u201cFourth Sister, it\u2019s better that we wait for Sister and Second Brother at home. Don\u2019t go with them. Sister and Second Brother is going to work!\u201dHow would Lian Fang Qing be willing to listen? She shook her head: \u201cDon\u2019t want to! I want to go, I could also help Sister and Second Brother with work!\u201dLian Xiao Man gasped and said: \u201cWe\u2019re working, so where would we have time to take care of you! Third Aunt is telling you, in town, there are loads of kidnappers who purposely kidnap children. Being kidnapped by thorough kidnappers, you\u2019ll be sold to a wealthy family as a maid and never see your brothers and sister again!\u201dLian Fang Qing was frightened, she was really somewhat afraid. She looked toward Lian Fang Zhou.She was skeptical of Third Aunt\u2019s words, but she believed her own sister\u2019s.Lian Fang Zhou wasn\u2019t willing to lie to her\u2013 the younger siblings trust her that much, so she doesn\u2019t want to lose their trust.She gently rubbed Lian Fang Qing\u2019s head, softly said: \u201cAlthough it\u2019s not as terrible as Third Aunt said, there are kidnappers. You be good and stay at home, I\u2019ll buy yummy food to bring back for you to eat, alright? Wait until when we\u2019re free, I\u2019ll take you there!\u201d\u201cSister, you and Second Brother come back soon, we\u2019ll stay at home, don\u2019t worry!\u201d Not waiting for Lian Fang Qing to speak, Lian Che quickly spoke out.Lian Fang Qing pouted, but didn\u2019t continue to pester, only reminded Lian Fang Zhou: \u201cSister don\u2019t forget to buy us yummy food!\u201d\u201cAlright, I remembered!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled, then grinned toward Lian Xiao Man: \u201cThird Aunt, tomorrow I\u2019ll trouble to watch over Qing er and Che er at home!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Lian Xiao Man paused, then quickly said: \u201cI stay back? Naturally, I should go with you to town! Since I\u2019m an adult and a lot of matters you children won\u2019t understand ah. Like when buying things, get tricked! Is there any need to watch over Qing er and Che er? They grew up here and no longer little toddlers!\u201dAuthor Note- Cough, a new character is about to appear.[1]back breaking =reputation ruining[2]clever at thinking of petty tricksPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And said to Lian Fang Zhou: \u201cSister, how about letting Third Aunt come with us? It\u2019s better to have her with us.\u201dThe way Lian Ze think is simple. Since he and Sister are still young and it\u2019s the first time heading to town, what could be done when they get tricked? Third Aunt is an adult and when the other party sees an adult is present, they might reconsider, right?The more important thing is, he suddenly finds out that Third Aunt isn\u2019t as loathsome as before. However, he still doesn\u2019t like her.\u201cThat\u2019s right! What Ah Ze said is right! With me, you won\u2019t be on the losing end!\u201d Lian Xiao Man was delighted. She slapped her thigh and not allowing any more room for discussion, said: \u201cIt\u2019s decided like this. Now let\u2019s sleep earlier, so we can go earlier tomorrow.\u201dWithout any choice, Lian Fang Zhou nodded: \u201cAlright then. However, Third Aunt, I must say this beforehand. In front of others, you cannot interrupt me when I\u2019m talking. Wait until I finish, then you can speak. Also not allowed to undermine me and the family head is still me!\u201d\u201cI know, I know! Why would I undermine you? We\u2019re all one family\u2026\u201d Third Aunt chattered as she returns to her room.The next day, early in the morning, the three of them left. Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che also woke up to send them off. Despite being half awake, Lian Fang Qing didn\u2019t forget to remind Sister and Brother to bring back yummy snacks.Yesterday, Uncle Wang gave them some simple pointers on driving the donkey cart. The donkey was also docile. So Lian Fang Zhou sat at the front driving the cart and Lian Ze and Third Aunt sat at the back.Third Aunt talked non-stop during the whole journey. She excitedly jibbered jabber, while Lian Ze answered occasionally. Lian Fang Zhou also found her to be too noisy, so might as well concentrate on driving and pretend to not hear anything\u2014 isn\u2019t it just going to town? Look how excited she is!Everything went very smoothly. With just the two big and perfect Reishi Mushroom, they earned ten silver liang. But Third Aunt and Lian Ze don\u2019t know about this matter. Lian Fang Zhou had hidden it in a cloth when carrying it and then found some excuse to go to the medicinal shop to sell it.She needed to leave some money for emergencies. It\u2019s fine with Lian Ze, but definitely can\u2019t let Third Aunt know.Three full bags and a half of mushrooms were sold to a restaurant for nearly four liang. Third Aunt was ecstatic as if that money were hers. Her face was smiling like a blooming flower. While her hands were rubbing non-stop and she laughed happily: \u201cCan\u2019t believe this! Really can\u2019t believe this!\u201dAlthough Lian Ze\u2019s reaction wasn\u2019t as exaggerated as Third Aunt, he was also extremely overjoyed. Eyes lighting up as he smiled at Lian Fang Zhou.\u201cFang Zhou, it\u2019s better to let me hold the money, in case you lose it!\u201d Third Aunt\u2019s heart was itching as she couldn\u2019t suppress saying.It\u2019ll be strange if Lian Fang Zhou agree. So with an indifference smile, she said: \u201cNo need to trouble Third Aunt. It\u2019ll be more convenient for me to hold it, as there are lots of things I need to buy in a while.\u201dThird Aunt still had something to say, but Lian Ze spoke out first: \u201cThird Aunt, Sister, we should quickly go buy things, that way we return earlier! The winter sun sets earlier and it\u2019ll be cold on the way back if we\u2019re late.\u201d\u201cIndeed, we better hurry then!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou grinned.Without any choice, Third Aunt could only let it go.The three of them soon bought everything like bolts of cloth, needles, threads, rugs, blankets, quilts, seasonings, flour as well as other small bits and pieces.Lian Fang Zhou also went to few blacksmiths to look around the cost of making farming tools. It\u2019s about time to change the farm tools at home. She also checked out the prices of the Four Treasures of Study [1]. Afterwards, she enquired about the prices of the vegetables, fruits, and meats in the market\u2013 things that she didn\u2019t know but needed to know.When passing by the makeup and hair accessories stall, she bought 2 hair scarves and 3 silky velvet flower pins. The hair scarves are for herself, while one of the flower pins are for Lian Fang Qing and other two are for Mrs. Zhao and Li Juan.But Third Aunt thought it was for her and the Lian sisters, so her heart was bursting with delight. Even put out her hand and said: \u201cI keep my own one, so it doesn\u2019t get ruined.\u201dLian Fang Zhou stared blankly: Aren\u2019t widows not allowed to wear red and green? And also bright flower hair accessories?And also, when did I ever say there\u2019s her share? And already so old\u2026Seeing Lian Fang Zhou staring at her blankly, Third Aunt look at the flower and started laughing. And said: \u201cLook at you. I\u2019m already at this age and you bought such bright color. How could I wear it! I\u2019ll change it to something simple!\u201dAfter saying that, she started to look at the stall and selected a willow green one. She placed it on her hair bun to size it up. Then asked the stall owner does it look good?Of course, he would grin and say it look good.Third Aunt then turned toward Lian Fang Zhou: \u201cI\u2019ll take this one then! So return that one!\u201dLian Fang Zhou smiled but did return the one in her hand. And also didn\u2019t say another word to Third Aunt. Just pay for another one and left.However Third Aunt was immersed in her inner happiness, so she didn\u2019t notice.\u201cLet\u2019s eat something now. In a while, we\u2019re going back!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou said after seeing a kinda of clean noodle shop by the roadside.\u201cAlright, alright! I\u2019m already starving!\u201d said Third Aunt. She entered the shop first.\u201cSister, actually we could just buy few mantou nearby. We each get a bowl of soup is enough\u2026\u201d Lian Ze spoke out.Such understanding words made people heartache. Lian Fang Zhou gave a slight smile. As she pulled Lian Ze in, she said: \u201cHaving one bowl of noodle doesn\u2019t cost much, Sister know what to do!\u201dThe siblings just sat down, when Third Aunt said: \u201cI just ordered a braised pork noodle. What do you guys want?\u201dLian Ze wanted to get a vegetarian noodle but Lian Fang Zhou stopped him and ordered two bowls of braised pork noodle as well.Today was Market day, so the streets were crowded and very chaotic. This little shop was also packed with people, which comes with problems. It was really lively.A horse carriage just passed by the entrance. But because there were so many people, the horse carriage moved really slow. The driver would keep yelling out \u201cMake way! Please make way!\u201d His tone was very polite, not one bit irritated or overbearing. So Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t help but watch some more.Right about then, the waiter brought over the noodles. He saw the situation and grinned: \u201cThat\u2019s Grand Tutor Ding Family carriage. Have to say that Grand Tutor Ding is really a good person. He was the king\u2019s teacher but doesn\u2019t put on air. Also the manor\u2019s servants are very polite, never domineering.\u201cGrand Tutor Ding?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou grinned: \u201cOur County Yu actually produced such a big official!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d the waiter nodded and continued: \u201d Sadly, he\u2019s retired!\u201dThen he hurried back to work.Third Aunt stretched her head toward the horse carriage to catch a look. But immediately took back her gaze with disinterest, mouth twitching: \u201cAfraid there\u2019s not much to that tutor\u2019s home. Their horse looks so old. It\u2019s worst than our villager Li Yuan\u2019s maternal family one! What are you looking at brat? Hurry out eat or else it\u2019ll be cold!\u201dSeeing Lian Ze\u2019s eyes fixed on the outside, Third Aunt grinned as she patted his shoulder.\u201cI wasn\u2019t looking\u2026\u201d Lian Ze took back his gaze and continued eating.Lian Fang Zhou followed his line of gaze and paused. Lian Ze certainly wasn\u2019t looking at Grand Tutor Ding\u2019s family carriage, but instead a man sitting at an angle on the opposite street.[1] writing brush, an ink stick, an ink stone and paper.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even the slate gray clothes and puttee on him were old and dirty. At this moment, he sat near the wall with both of his hands hugging his knee. Those eyes were fixated on the nearby bun vendor.His whole body was worn-down and sullen grey. Only the pair eyes were especially bright. Although\u00a0he appears to look foolish now. But when those eyes moves, it make people believe that those are a pair of brilliant eyes.Lian Fang Zhou glance over at Lian Ze as she retract her gaze.It happened in a flash, but Lian Ze knew his sister understood what was on his mind. So he couldn\u2019t help comment: \u201cI just felt he\u2019s really pitiful.\u201dIt was certainly pitiful. Lian Fang Zhou took out several copper coins and gave them to him: \u201cGo buy some mantou for him!\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Lian Ze\u2019s eyes brightened with unexpected joy. He grabbed the coins and headed out.Third Aunt cried out to him in shock. When she rushed out to look for him, she saw that he is already giving out the mantou that he just bought to the guy. With full of detest, she let out some tsk: \u201cYou two siblings really know how to live. Why bother with a beggar who got nothing to do with you? Is money that easy to earn? Don\u2019t your heart hurt when it\u2019s spent?\u201dLian Fang Zhou just indifferently smiled: \u201cIt\u2019s just a few copper. I saw that he is starving and that I have the power to do some good.\u201dThird Aunt kept on whispering: \u201cThere so many like him in the world, can you help all of them? What if one day, you got nothing to eat, who would help\u2026\u201dLian Fang Zhou left her be and continued to eat.Not long later, Lian Ze returned. Third Aunt also nagged him a bit.But Lian Ze also ignored her as he lowered his head to focus on his noodles.Third Aunt saw there\u2019s no point, so she continued eating.Once the three of them finished, they paid the bill and left.Third Aunt didn\u2019t forget to smack her lips as she reminiscing the taste and with endless yearning, she sighed: \u201cThat noodle was really fragrant and delicious. It would be wonderful if I could have it every day! Life would be worth living!\u201dLian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t help chuckle. Isn\u2019t it just a bowl of noodle, no need to say \u2018life would be worth living\u2019. She, Lian Fang Zhou believe her standard won\u2019t fall that low.Third Aunt thought she was laughing at her wishful thinking, so she rolled her eyes: \u201cWhat are you laughing at? I know it isn\u2019t possible, can\u2019t I just talk about it!\u201d\u201cNothing like that!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou grinned: \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that. What I mean is Third Aunt, your standard of need is very easily satisfied!\u201d\u201cHmph, you are laughing at me!\u201d Third Aunt rolled her eyes at her, taking it as Lian Fang Zhou saying the opposite.Now the three of them are full, they exited the town to return home.Third Aunt started to yawn since she woke up so early and also rush around half the day. Now that she is full and out of town, exhaustion set in. So she hid in the cart to sleep.Lian Ze was also a bit tired. But he was also afraid that Lian Fang Zhou was also tired, so he motivated himself to chat with her.The siblings weren\u2019t loud, and with none of Third Aunt\u2019s muttering in their ears, the mood soon became light.Lian Fang Zhou suddenly cried out: \u201cAh, I forgot to ask around the price of charcoal. If it was cheap, I should buy it now or else later it gets cold and the price increase.\u201d\u201cForget about it Sis,\u201d Lian Ze was somewhat surprised when she said that. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the wealth for such things. Making fire with firewood is fine. We can\u2019t afford charcoal! Only the rich could afford to use those things. Wait until tomorrow, when we gather more mushrooms, we can save more money. It\u2019s good enough if we can eat well and bundle up during winter.\u201dCompare to unpractical charcoal, Lian Ze is more interested in gathering mushroom. Especially when hearing from Lian Fang Zhou, that when the weather gets colder, there\u2019ll be no more mushrooms to pick, so he became more anxious and full of energy.Lian Fang Zhou overlooked the matter of mushroom. Instead she enquiringly asked: \u201cCharcoals are really expensive?\u201d\u201cAin\u2019t that right!\u201d Lian Ze replied: \u201cNot many people understand how to make charcoal, so how could it not be expensive!\u201dLian Fang Zhou\u2019s heart was moved and started thinking. If this is also another path to fortune, she could give it a try. Just with her and Lian Ze wouldn\u2019t do. Need to find a partner. Hmm, of course, Uncle Li and Aunt Zhang are the most suitable\u2026Once she made her decision, Lian Fang Zhou felt her blood pumping. She planned to go to Uncle Li and Aunt Zhang\u2019s place to discuss.The siblings talked as they drove the donkey cart. When Lian Fang Zhou unintentionally looked up, she saw that out of nowhere, five-six rascal-like youth appeared in front of them. Those thugs were blocking the road. Numerous pairs of shifty eyes were laughing as they watch them.Lian Fang Zhou heart shook and suddenly pulled on the reins. She unblinkingly glared at them.They come across robbery!Internally she felt really anxious. Eyes scanned around. This region was completely remote, with green hills on both sides and not a single person around\u2026.At this moment, she immediately felt despair and thought: why did we happen to meet with this situation?\u201cWho, who are you guys!\u201d Lian Ze also saw them, his face changed as he called out in shock.\u201cHAHAHAHA!\u201d those thugs immediately burst out laughing, sounded incomparably wild and shameless.One of them pointed at the stuff behind them, full of delight as he shouted: \u201cLeave everything including the donkey cart and money behind, then you three can scram!\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201d Lian Ze said without a single thought. The cart was borrowed and the things were bought with hard earned money, so how can he agree to leave them behind.\u201cHmph!\u201d That person coldly sneered, not putting any importance on Lian Ze and Lian Fang Zhou, who were still kids, or Lian Xiao Man.Lian Fang Zhou bitterly cried inside, she didn\u2019t know how these guys set their eyes on them! How much could they possibly have?What she didn\u2019t know was, when she went to the medicinal shop and got ten silver liang for the Reishi Mushroom has fallen into their eyes. Then later, they kept on following them.Ten silver, donkey, cart and the money from selling mushroom was enough to move their heart.Even though there are lots of rich people on the street, but when wanting to take action, they need to look at the target\u2019s situation.Without a doubt, Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s group was the perfect target to take action on.\u201cReal men waste no time chattering with you! Since you refuse the toast, then drink this penalty! Brothers advance, throw them off the cart!\u201d The leader laughed.It would be troublesome if someone come across after all this was the main road.He said it like there\u2019s not much to it. As if this matter is very easy to do.Few thugs snicker as they complied, delightfully laughing as they walked toward the siblings.And at this time, Third Aunt was still sleeping sweetly, gave a slight snore. Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry when she heard it.\u201cSister, what to do! What do we do!\u201d Lian Ze firmly clenched his fists, slightly quivering. Even veins were popping on the back of his hands.He has never hated himself as much as now, hated that he couldn\u2019t do anything.Lian Fang Zhou bit her lips, her whole heart was so worried that it went \u2018thump thump\u2019.What to do? What could be done?Right now the only way was to lose fortune to get rid of calamity.\u201cGive it to them!\u201d when Lian Fang Zhou said this, her heart ached so much and was also boiling with rage.Their fruit of labor after working hard for so many days and the happiness and expectation that was accumulated bit by bit, was now destroyed in a blink of an eye.She was full of resentment.\u201cNO! I\u2013\u201d\u201cAh Ze!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou held onto the impulsive Lian Ze who wanted to rush forward and fight them to death, unmovingly said: \u201cThere\u2019s still a mountain. So there\u2019s no worry of having no firewood. So even if you aren\u2019t willing, then what? Even if you fight with your life, it still won\u2019t change the result. It\u2019ll just leave you a body of injuries and then we\u2019ll have to waste money to treat you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Where did this beggar come from? This master wants you to scram away!\u201d\u201cStinky beggar, find life too long?!\u201dSeeing clearly who that person was, the few thugs started arrogantly jeer.That person was still standing there, indifferently looking at them, placid expression.His calmness infuriated some of the thugs: being taken lightly by a beggar, how can they continue to live from now on?\u201cReally unlucky! Dare to stick into our business, brothers, teach that beggar who doesn\u2019t know what death is.\u201d Embarrassment becoming anger, the leader spat on the ground. He waved his arm as he rolled up his sleeves, leading everyone to venomously rush toward them.Lian Ze tightly closed his eyes, Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s heart thumped.When she regained her wits, she was in midst of yelling \u2018It got nothing to do with him\u2019, it was already too late.Those thugs were already yelling out as they rush to hit, Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t help subconsciously move her eyes away.Tragic cries continuously reach into ears. It wasn\u2019t one person but a good few people.She and Lian Ze quickly looked over and what they saw made them overjoyed. The thugs had fallen onto the ground, clutching their limbs and heads. Grimacing in pain as they scream endlessly. And that man was still standing there firmly with his face still remaining calm.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on! What\u2019s going on! Where are we? Ah!\u201d Third Aunt just rubbed her eyes and sat up. When seeing the scene before her, she cried out in shock.\u201cLeave!\u201d that person said in a calm voice.That bunch of thugs dares not have any more evil thoughts. They endured the pain as they hurriedly picked themselves up and scrammed away with bit crawl. In a blink of the eyes, they were no longer in sight.\u201cThis\u2026 what has happened?\u201d Third Aunt spoke out some prayers. She wanted to stand up but her legs were soft, so she collapsed into sitting.\u201cHe saved us! Sister, he saved us!\u201d Lian Ze\u2019s eyes were shining with ecstasy, he happily called out to that man as he speeded over. Lian Ze could not help but take his arm and shook it in excitement: \u201cYou are amazing! You drove them away!\u201d\u201cMany thanks to you\u2026Sir, for saving us!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou also came over. She smiled as she spoke to him.Originally she wanted to say \u2018Many thanks, hero\u2019 But seeing the person\u2019s messy hair and beard, and his whole body was dirty, she thought \u2018can he be called hero\u2019. Not bothering if this place has the same meaning, but she felt embarrassed saying it out loud.The man grinned. When he smiles, his eyes light up bright, and his whole vibe seems to immediately change.\u201cI saw them sneakily follow you halfway, then took a shortcut to ambush\u2014\u201d He said with a smile. Once he finished, his face suddenly faces changed and fainted on the ground.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong! Hey, wake up, wake up!\u201d Lian Ze anxiously cried, he hurriedly squat down and shook him.Lian Fang Zhou was also startled.\u201dSister, he\u2019s injured! He\u2019s bleeding! It must be those guys just now!\u201d Lian Ze exclaimed.Lian Fang Zhou quickly look over, and saw fresh blood oozing out of the man\u2019s arm, she then shouted: \u201cQuickly bandage him. We got to stop the bleeding first, then talk!\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d Lian Ze responded and rushed to carefully help that man lay on the floor. He tore a piece off his clothes, then bandage him up.\u201cFang Zhou, Fang Zhou!\u201d Lian Xiao Man finally clumsily stood up, jumped off the donkey cart and stumbled over. She pulled Lian Fang Zhou further away and with a glare, she reprimanded: \u201cYou\u2019re a girl, stay further away from this beggar! Do you still want to get married?! \u201d\u201cThird Aunt, don\u2019t call him beggar this beggar that. Truthfully, if he hasn\u2019t saved us just now, we would have become beggars!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou frowned.\u201cWhat?\u201d Third Aunt froze.Lian Fang Zhou looked at her and said: \u201cJust now, those few people were robbing us of our things, even the donkey too! If they really snatch away everything, we may have become beggars\u2014 the poor!\u201d\u201cSuch, such matter happened?!\u201d Third Aunt recalled back the scene she had seen when she just woke up. She couldn\u2019t help but let out a breath of relief and patted her chest. With lingering fear, Third Aunt said: \u201cOh, and I was sleeping like a dead log. It so fortunate, so lucky!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lian Fang Zhou was speechless, rolled her eyes and removed her(Xiao Man) hand to move toward Lian Ze to ask: \u201cAre there any other injured? Is it serious?\u201dAfter Lian Ze helped bandage him up, he had already checked him again. He replied: \u201cSome seems like traces of old wounds. But it isn\u2019t serious.\u201dLian Fang Zhou nodded her head as her heart settled a bit. She mentally thought what should she do?Lian Ze has already spoken out at the side: \u201cSister, he\u2019s injured from saving us, so could we take him back home?\u201dIn front there\u2019s no village, nor were there shops behind. Not to mention the fact that man was injured unconscious. And at the moment, can only do that!Not waiting for Lian Fang Zhou to give a nod, Third Aunt has already shaking her head and waving her hands: \u201cNo way! How can you bring back a beg- stranger home? How would others see us? Fang Zhou, you are a girl!\u201dLian Fang Zhou shot back: \u201cDon\u2019t we have you? Who can say what? If we throw our savior to one side, ignoring his life or death. Then how will we look? Third Aunt, come help out!\u201dThird Aunt frowned in disgust: \u201cThis dirty \u2026\u201dNow Lian Fang Zhou is starting to get a bit angry, so with a darkened face, she said: \u201cYou\u2019re not willing to help, then forget it. Ah Ze and I don\u2019t have so much strength, so can only take it slow. If by chance the thugs return \u2013 \u201d\u201cComing, coming!\u201d Not waiting for Lian Fang Zhou to finish the sentence, Third Aunt quickly came over.Lian Ze couldn\u2019t help but smile.This man\u2019s physique was tall and on top of that, he\u2019s unconscious, his body heavily sunk straight down. It took the three of them great effort before they could get him into the car.Third Aunt naturally frowns hard, while kept on nagging and nagging. Not stopping until she got Lian Fang Zhou to promise \u201cwait for him to wake up and then let him scram!\u201dBut Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t say anything, only pretend to not hear it.Lian Fang Zhou hurriedly drove the cart. Even when they reach home, that man still did not wake up.The three of them had no choice but to get him off the cart and place him in Lian Ze\u2019s and Lian Che\u2019s room.When Lian Che and Lian Fang Qing saw it, they were shocked at first. But hearing this man saved their sister and brother, both of them were no longer afraid. They also helped draw water and grab a towel.This person was a man, so it was inconvenient for Lian sister and Third Aunt to stay by his side, so they went out to bring in the stuff they bought. Afterward, Lian Fang Zhou drove the cart back to Uncle Wang to return it. And on the way, she brought a package of sesame candy for Uncle Wang\u2019s granddaughter.Until it was time to light an oil lamp, the man finally woke up.At that time, Lian siblings and Third Aunt were preparing to eat. The man got out of bed and followed the light. Lian Fang Zhou looked up and saw him. She put down the chopsticks and got up to go over. Kindly smiled and asked: \u201cYou woke up? Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere? Is the wound still hurting?\u201dThe man was stunned for a moment, then hurriedly said, \u201cI \u2026 where am I? Did you save me?\u201dLian Fang Zhou chuckled: \u201cIt was you who saved us! If it wasn\u2019t for you, we would have been unlucky. Have you forgotten?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Luckily we had this big brother today!\u201d Lian Ze followed up.Lian Fang Qing tilted her head and blinked as she asked: \u201cFrom what Second Brother said, you beat up six bullies and chased them away all by yourself. Is that true?\u201dLian Che remained silent but also tilted his head in curiosity as he sized him up.Third Aunt jumped up and came over: \u201cSince you can stand up, it means you\u2019re okay right?\u201dThird Aunt, with eyes glowing, stared hard at him. She stretched out her neck, with an expression saying \u2018 I\u2019ll eat you if you don\u2019t answer\u2019.Startled, he opened his mouth and started stuttering. Under Third Aunt\u2019s eyes, he couldn\u2019t help but nod: \u201d I\u2019m al-already fine!\u201d\u201cThen that\u2019s perfect!\u201d Third Aunt clapped her hands and continued: \u201cYou saved us and we saved you.Now we\u2019re equal right? We won\u2019t make it difficult for you, now that it\u2019s already dark. You can leave tomorrow morning then.\u201dThird Aunt spoke out with great generosity.\u201cOh! I\u2019m very grateful to you-\u201dHe hasn\u2019t finished yet when Lian Ze rushed to speak out: \u201cThis brother, there\u2019s no need to be polite. Even though you woke up, you\u2019re still not well and it is still hard for you to move around. How about staying a few more days?\u201dLian Ze looked over at Lian Fang Zhou with a pleading expression as he spoke: \u201cSister, he got hurt because of us. We can\u2019t be so inconsiderate!\u201dLian Ze wasn\u2019t usually like this, so Lian Fang Zhou felt that it was slightly strange. But it was because he rarely requests anything from Lian Fang Zhou, she couldn\u2019t refuse when she saw those eager eyes. So she nodded: \u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201dShe smiled at the man and spoke warmly: \u201cIt\u2019s no problem to stay few more days at our place!\u201d\u201cAH! I must say you guys\u2014\u201d Third Aunt unhappily cried out.But she had yet to finish when Lian Fang Zhou lightly cleared her throat. Indifferently said: \u201cThird Aunt do you need Ah Ze and I to send you back tomorrow?\u201dImmediately, Third Aunt shut up. She lightly harrumphed: \u201cThen it\u2019s fine to let him stay a few days. Ah, I was thinking of what\u2019s best for you!\u201dAnd in a whisper, she muttered: \u201cKnow only how to threaten people with that. What\u2019s the point\u2026\u201dLian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze pretended not to hear anything.Full of joy, Lian Ze pulled the man to sit with enthusiasm, then said: \u201cI\u2019ll get the bowls!\u201d And went to the kitchen.Originally the rice was just enough. But now there\u2019s one more person joining, it became insufficient.Lian Ze pushed his bowl toward the man: \u201cBig Brother has this!\u201dSeeing this, Lian Fang Zhou gave half of her to Lian Ze. Grinned: \u201cAlright, you guys eat first! If there\u2019s not enough, just wait a bit. I\u2019m going to make some noodle!\u201d\u201cSis, I\u2019ll help with the fire!\u201d Lian Che could see that the strange guest is very important to Second Brother, so he voluntarily put down his chopsticks and went to help with the stove.\u201cServe you right!\u201d Third Aunt muttered quietly. She picked some stir-fry pepper and meat for Lian Fang Qing: \u201cAren\u2019t you guys hungry? Well, I\u2019m starving, so let\u2019s eat first!\u201dTonight was stir-fry pepper and meat and fried cabbage. Good dishes like these were rare.Lian Ze saw the man\u2019s eye lit up. Obviously, he was also hungry. After hesitating for a moment, he said: \u201cLet\u2019s eat first!\u201d\u201cLeave some for Sister and Third Brother!\u201d Lian Fang Qing spoke out and grabbed the chopsticks to create a dividing line on the plate. So the few of them only ate one side.Lian Fang Zhou recalled that man\u2019s condition in the day then made a large portion of noodles. She diced the chili pepper and garlic, slice three to four pieces of meat fat and heat them into the oil. She planned to infuse some chili oil on top.Lian Che sat on a stool in front of the stove opening, watching the fire. The crackling fire shone on his face, both of hands cupping his cheeks and big eyes blinking at Lian Fang Zhou. Asking,\u201dSister, did that man really save you? Is he that powerful?\u201dLian Che felt that it was unbelievable. Just by judging by his appearance, it didn\u2019t look like it.\u201cMmhmm,\u201d Lian Fang Zhou nodded with a smile. As she chopped the vegetable, she calmly said: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for him, we would be in deep trouble today. All of our stuff and money would have been robbed. And when we come back, we got to pay back Uncle\u2019s Wang\u2019s donkey and cart!\u201d\u201cAH!\u201d Hearing this, Lian Che was a bit afraid. Then grinned: \u201cThankfully meet with a good samaritan! Third Aunt is too much, to want to drive him out. Hm, it\u2019s better if he keeps on staying here. No one will bully us anymore!\u201dWhat? Lian Fang Zhou was immediately stunned. This kid really dare say it. And look at that hopeful gaze.Lian Fang Zhou laughed with a closed mouth. Shaking her head, not taking his words seriously. Feeling the firelight has dimmed a bit, she continued: \u201cMake the fire stronger.\u201d\u201cOK,\u201d Lian Che answered. He bent down to add some firewood into the stove and not another word was said.Making noodles didn\u2019t need much work, so soon Lian Fang Zhou brought an enormous bowl of soup noodle with greasy chili and garlic sauce spread on top. Hot steam carrying along fragrant smell filled everyone\u2019s nose.Everyone\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t help light up. It\u2019s known that with this household\u2019s current situation, it\u2019s hard to have even simple noodles once a year. Especially with meat, it was a real treat!\u201cSmell so good!\u201d Lian Fang Qing took a deep breathe in.Originally Third Aunt was already full, but seeing the large bowl of noodles and the smelling fragrant, her stomach immediately became hungry again. So she spoke out: \u201cHow could he finish that much? Here, give me a bowl!\u201d\u201cSister and Third Brother haven\u2019t eaten yet!\u201d Lian Fang Qing\u2019s lips twitched.Even though Lian Fang Zhou don\u2019t like Third Aunt acting like this, but she felt she was pitiful. However, she can\u2019t spoil her, or else she\u2019ll have gained an inch, want a foot behavior.Lian Fang Zhou could only pretend to not hear her, smiling: \u201d I purposely made a lot, so everyone can have some! Tomorrow, we\u2019ll make noodles for dinner, alright?\u201d\u201cAlright! Alright!\u201d Lian Fang Qing clapped as she rejoiced.Third Aunt also laughed in delight: \u201cThen make some more tomorrow!\u201dLian Fang Zhou used the serving chopsticks to fill half a bowl for everybody, and what remained, she put in the bowl of the male guest. With a light smile, she said: \u201cHere, eat it while it\u2019s hot!\u201dHe paused at first, then received it with a sheepish smile. He cupped his fist: \u201cMany thanks, Miss!\u201dThen pulled the large bowl to his front and gracefully started eating.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou light smiled. This guy is really interesting.Even though he is starving, he eats leisurely and with a nice style.That\u2019s right, in the nice styles.It\u2019s neither elegant nor rough. Even in tattered old clothes, the way he moves maintains a style and gives a comfortable feeling.Lian Fang Zhou became dazed from looking, internally thinking: this man, I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s not an ordinary person. It is not obvious because he met some hardships, but with that kind of skill, definitely not an ordinary person.\u201cKe! Keke!\u201d Third Aunt started coughing hard. Lian Fang Zhou turned to look at her and saw a pair of eyes pointedly stared at her.At first, she paused, then she realized that in Third Aunt\u2019s eyes, she stared at that man until she became dazed. And she was misunderstood.\u00a0[ED: or not, the auntie also knows a thing or two.]Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s face became hot and immediately felt embarrassed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lian Fang Zhou admired herself for being able to smile without a trace of guilt! Afterwards, she stopped her gaze, picked up her chopsticks and calmly ate.Her method had really worked. Third Aunt paused and blinked. She felt a bit suspicious that there was something wrong with her eyes a moment ago.\u201cThird Aunt, did you catch a chill?\u201d Lian Fang Qing couldn\u2019t help but asked.Hearing this, both Lian Ze and Lian Che looked at Third Aunt, with a hint of care in their eyes.Lian Fang Zhou secretly sigh out a breath of relief. Luckily only Third Aunt saw her distraction.So she became even calmer.\u201cI haven\u2019t. It\u2019s just that, I choked a bit!\u201d Third Aunt gave a reluctant smile as she gave an excuse.\u201cOh!\u201d Lian Fang Qing replied and dropped the topic, focusing on her bowl as she sipped her soup.Hearing this, Lian Fang Zhou laughed on the inside.After dinner like normal routine, Third Aunt tidied up and went to the kitchen to wash dishes. Lian Fang Zhou turned to Lian Ze: \u201cGo find some of our dad\u2019s clothes for him to change. Let him wash himself and take off the dirtied clothes!\u201dAnd she also turned to grin to the man: \u201cIt\u2019s old clothes, please don\u2019t reject! You have to clean those wounds as you bathe so they will not fester. Tomorrow I\u2019ll go to the village and ask for a bit medicinal liquor from someone. So tonight you\u2019ll have to suffer a bit!\u201dLian Ze eagerly agreed and went off.That man shook his head, grinned: \u201cActually \u2026 these injuries aren\u2019t that serious. It\u2019ll get better by itself in few days.\u201dFull with shame, he thought: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t because I haven\u2019t eaten anything recently, I wouldn\u2019t be so useless.\u201dHis hair has been slightly tidied up, while his beard was still a lot like bird nests. His smiles were showing rows of neat white teeth.Lian Fang Zhou politely invited him to sit. With a smile, she asked: \u201cOh yes, I have not asked for your name yet! Where do you live?\u201dHearing this, the man couldn\u2019t help paused a bit. His expression immediately became low-spirited, and seems to give a low sigh.Lian Fang Zhou also halted, then smiled again: \u201cIf you have some difficulties that you do not want explain, then forget it. It doesn\u2019t matter!\u201dIf there\u2019s really difficulties that he has to hide, most likely it is some troublesome matter. Lian Fang Zhou rather not know anything about it. Avoid attracting trouble out of nowhere!She has three siblings to raise and she must work hard herself to survive in this poor environment. So she doesn\u2019t\u2019 feel like she got the qualifications to intervene in other people\u2019s troubles.If this matter is troublesome for him, even if he has such good skills, can\u2019t imagine what it would be like to Lian family.\u201cNot like that!\u201d The man quickly denied. He scratched his head, and with an embarrassed look: \u201cMiss, you misunderstood. I don\u2019t hide any difficulties, but actually, I lost my memories!\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s eyes widened in amazement: is this the legendary amnesia?With a wry smile, he said: \u201cWhen I woke up I was on a riverbank. And unknowingly wandered into Yuhe County. It was like this til I met you today\u2026 No matter how much I try, I still can\u2019t remember who I am, where I am from, or what has happened to me in the past!\u201dLian Fang Zhou suddenly didn\u2019t know what to say. In her heart, she couldn\u2019t help feel sympathetic toward him.The man thought for a moment, then gave a faint smile. Feeling somewhat self-deprecating, he said: \u201cI came to Yuhe County with a group of migrants. Maybe \u2013 like them, my home was destroyed by floods!\u201dFor a moment, Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t know what to say. With a laugh, she spoke: \u201cI was in the wrong. I should not have brought it up! Please feel at ease in our home, as you nurse your wounds. No need to overthink!\u201dThe man nodded his head.Understanding what Lian Fang Zhou meant, he immediately said: \u201cAfter\u2026 After two days, I will leave.\u201dLian Fang Zhou\u2019s cheeks heated up and felt a bit embarrassed as he was very tactful and said it so straightforward. She grinned: \u201d I didn\u2019t mean it like this, I\u2026\u201dSuddenly the man looked up and smiled at her, as if he understood even without her speaking out. And he didn\u2019t blame her either.Lian Fang Zhou felt even more terrible. No matter what, he did save the three of them right? Pushing him to leave is certainly hurtful.She was at loss what to say. Luckily Lian Ze found the clothes and came back. So Lian Fang Zhou rushed Lian Ze to take him to wash himself.She let out a sigh of relief when she saw them leave.\u201cSister, sister!\u201d At this time, Lian Che ran over and said: \u201cAunt Zhang asked when did you come back? And also told you to visit her house!\u201d\u201cOops,\u201d Lian Fang Zhou slapped her forehead and spoke with some chagrin: \u201cHow could I forget about Aunt Zhang! Silly me! Ah Che, why didn\u2019t you remind Sister earlier!\u201d\u201cI forgot!\u201d Lian Che rubbed his head and stuck his tongue out.Lian Fang Zhou smiled and told him to go play on his own. She then got up and grabbed two velvet flowers and wrapped them in paper. Afterward filled a basket half full of the dried mushrooms she had stored for themselves. Then went to the kitchen and cut out about half a pound of pork.Thus she prepared a gift for Aunt Zhang and her family. The two velvet flowers were for Mrs Zhao and Li Juan.When Lian Fang Zhou was cutting the pork, Third Aunt had just finished washing the dishes. She had yet to leave the kitchen, when she saw her (Fang Zhou) cut the meat. Her eyes were staring straight at her and asked: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dLian Fang Zhou glanced at her and indifferently said: \u201cI\u2019m cutting a piece to send over to Aunt Zhang\u2019s. Should have send some long ago. Just that when we came back, I was busy and forgot to give it!\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d Third Aunt immediately exclaimed. She felt hurt as if the meat was cut by Lian Fang Zhou from her own body.Furiously, she stepped forward, said: \u201cAre you crazy or stupid?! There\u2019s not enough to eat at home, and you actually want gift to other people for free!\u201dLian Fang Zhou halted the kitchen knife and looked up at her. With some helplessness, she said: \u201cThird Aunt, as a human person, first we must live with our conscience, and secondly, think of the long term! Aunt Zhang and Uncle Li have helped us a lot. When they got something, they are willing to share with us. So there is no reason why we shouldn\u2019t share with them! Moreover, the future road is still long. We don\u2019t have any grown men supporting our family, so we\u2019ll have to trouble them with a lot of matters. Got to show some gratitude or else how our conscience will be at ease? \u201dThird Aunt knew that she was telling the truth, and didn\u2019t argue back for a moment.However, her heart still ached, so she continued: \u201cEven if you want to show gratitude, you don\u2019t have to this generous! Do you not feel pain cutting off this piece of pork ah?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou simply straightforwardly answered her back. She had finished cutting as she talked.She placed that cut of meat into a bowl and grinned at Third Aunt. \u201cI\u2019ll make a trip over now, so I\u2019ll have to trouble Third Aunt to store the rest!\u201dWithout waiting for her to continue fussing, she went straight out.\u201cYou -\u201d Third Aunt angrily glared, as she couldn\u2019t do anything else.With a distressed heart, she carefully packed the rest of the meat as she unhappily grumbled: \u201cActing so generous, she got no sense of living. There is not enough gold mountain for you to spend, prodigal \u2026 \u2026 if I was the head, it certainly would not be like this \u2026 \u2026\u201dWhen Lian Fang Zhou arrived at Aunt Zhang\u2019s home, Aunt Zhang\u2019s family had already had dinner.\u201cI came over because I just heard from Che er that Aunt was looking for me! I should have came over earlier, but I had completely forgotten about it!\u201dLian Fang Zhou smiled to Aunt Zhang and Uncle Li. After greeting them, she put down the gift basket and continued: \u201cFew days back, Ah Ze and I picked these mushrooms. All are good ones, so rest assured aunt and uncle, you can eat them. Today I cut a piece of meat. I hope that aunt will make a scrumptious meal, so please don\u2019t disdain that there\u2019s so little!\u201dThe mushroom were fine but seeing that the piece of meat was around half a catty, Aunt Zhang, Uncle Li, their son and daughter-in-law were shocked.Mrs Zhao was so happy that her heart was blooming. She could not help but reach out as she laughed: \u201cOh,Fang Zhou, you\u2019re so kind-hearted. How could we accept!\u201dEven as she said it, she did not return the giftPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In front of Lian Fang Zhou and her son, she wouldn\u2019t tell her daughter-in-law off. So she turned to Lian Fang Zhou, complained: \u201cReally Fang Zhou! Why buy this much meat? Even if you have money, don\u2019t spend it like this! If you bought rice and threw some sweet potato in, it would last a while.\u201dLian Fang Zhou said with a chuckle: \u201cI knew Aunt would say this! You should let me explain first! The money I used to buy meat, came from seling the mushrooms Ah Ze and I gathered few days back. The young ones are still growing, so they have to eat properly, and that means meat at least occasionally! I also thought of how Aunt and Uncle Li always help us. So naturally I can\u2019t forget your share. Otherwise, we\u2019ll have no peace of mind when eating!\u201dLian Fang Zhou\u2019s words made everyone smile.Uncle Li grinned: \u201cFang Zhou is getting more and more of a smooth talker! You really don\u2019t need to do this. We are all neighbors. It\u2019s just a matter of lending a hand, so don\u2019t need to take it into heart!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Aunt Zhang gave her a scolding smile, but she didn\u2019t blame her.Lian Fang Zhou grinned and took out an bundle from her sleeves and uncovered it. She gave the two velvet flowers to Mrs Zhao and Li Juan and happily explained: \u201cWhen I bought one for my Qing er, I also bought these for Sao-zi* and Ah Juan. It\u2019s just something inexpensive, hope Sao-zi* and Ah Juan like it!\u201dHow could women, especially young women, not love pretty dress accessories like flowers? Both Mrs Zhao and Li Juan cried out in delight and compared how they looked. Clearly they loved it as they grinned from ear to ear as they endlessly thanked Fang Zhou.Aunt Zhang saw that her daughter-in-law and daughter were so happy, so she really couldn\u2019t say anything except helplessly staring at Lian Fang Zhou as she shook her head.For a while, everyone chattered and then Lian Fang Zhou asked with a smile: \u201cOh yes, I wonder why Aunt Zhang called for me\u2014\u201dAunt Zhang immediately remembered and laughed: \u201cGod, my memory! I was so focused on small talk that I forgot about the important matter! It\u2019s like this, you don\u2019t have any livestock at your place and no manure for next year. The crops won\u2019t grow in a field with no manure! We just happened to get ten catties of Chinese milk vetch seeds. If you want, I\u2019ll give six or seven catties, spread it around the fields in the next few days. Wait until early spring, it\u2019ll be good to use as green manure!\u201dAfter the Chinese milk vetch seeds are sowed, in the spring they grow knee high and bloom with small pinkish purple flowers. When it\u2019s time to plough the fields, just plough directly and plunge them into the soil. They are good fertilizer so it\u2019s called green manure.Lian Fang Zhou was aware of this. She has also been seen it in rural areas in modern times. But she did not expect this method to be used in this era.She nodded and said: \u201cUncle Li and Aunt have thought of everything. But if the leftover isn\u2019t enough, then don\u2019t worry about giving me less!\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t have many fields, so the leftover is enough for us! I have already packed the seeds for you. You can take them now! If the weather is good these few days, you can sow them.\u201d Aunt Zhang explained.\u201cFang Zhou, wait a sec. I\u2019ll get it for you now!\u201d Mrs. Zhao told Lian Fang Zhou and went to the pantry.Lian Fang Zhou agreed.In a moment Mrs Zhao came back with a small bag and handed it to Lian Fang Zhou: \u201cTake it!\u201dLian Fang Zhou took the bag, thanked and started to leave but Mrs Zhao curiously asked: \u201cFang Zhou, just now you said today you guys sold mushrooms. How much did you get for them?\u201dSince she was asked directly, of course Lian Fang Zhou had to answer. So she replied: \u201cAltogether there was around three sacks of dried mushrooms and we got four liang\u2013\u201d\u201cWhat! So much!\u201d Mrs Zhao cried out. Her face full of disbelief, surprise, and even envy.Not just her, even Uncle Li, Aunt Zhang, Li San Ge and Li Juan were stunned as well.Seeing them like this, Lian Fang Zhou felt a bit embarrassed.\u201cFang Zhou, is, this true?\u201d Aunt Zhang stammered out.Four silver liang! This is half a year of household expenses and it was inconceivable that it was earned in mere few days.\u201cThose mushrooms, are they really worth that much?\u201d Mrs Zhao couldn\u2019t help glance over at the basket that Lian Fang Zhou sent. She immediately felt pain: Those are money, it would be regrettable to eat them!Lian Fang Zhou smiled and described their mushroom enterprise.Hearing it, Aunt Zhang\u2019s expression changed: \u201cYou siblings dare go to Mount Xian Teng ? Really\u2014sigh!\u201dMrs Zhao unhappily commented: \u201cMother, if I knew that we could earn this much money, I would also go! What is there to be afraid of? Having too money will bite our hands?\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying!\u201d Aunt Zhang gave Mrs Zhao a dirty look.But Mrs Zhao did not care. She intimately looked over at Lian Fang Zhou, asking: \u201cFang Zhou, are you guys still going to forage mushrooms? If you go, take me as well! If something happen, having one more person there would help, right?\u201dOnce Mrs Zhao thought of the idea, she immediately imagined her share of the reward.In the same time, by herself she couldn\u2019t differentiate between edible and poisonous mushrooms. So she could sell poisonous ones and get into a lot of trouble. So it\u2019s safer to go with Lian Fang Zhou.Lian Fang Zhou sheepishly look at Aunt Zhang and said: \u201cI know that you and Uncle Li treat us siblings well. Originally I didn\u2019t want to hid this matter from you, but I was afraid you won\u2019t agreed if you knew. So I\u2013\u201dShe said it quietly and all in one breath: \u201cAunt Zhang, don\u2019t worry! I have self-control, so I won\u2019t act recklessly!\u00a0Ah Ze and the others are still young and it\u2019s their growing stage. It\u2019s not enough to eat rice only. It goes without saying, I need to think of other ideas!\u201dListening to this, Uncle Li sighed and then spoke: \u201cIt was difficult for you! In the future, they will definitely treat you well, since you are thinking for their better.\u201dAunt Zhang also sighed: \u201cNevermind! Since you said it like this, what else could I say? It\u2019s just that you need to be more careful. That mountain has hundreds types of mushrooms and many are poisonous. So those you never seen before, don\u2019t pick it! And also the places where mushrooms cluster, be careful when picking. The woods have different types of poisonous snakes and insects. If there are trails of something passing, remember to leave it! It\u2019s better that nothing happen. By chance something happen, it\u2019ll be a matter of life and death!\u201dHearing this, Lian Fang Zhou felt scared. She hurriedly said: \u201cFang Zhou accepts your teaching. Thank you Aunt for your advice!\u201dAunt Zhang smiled and no longer spoke.Mrs Zhao burst out asking: \u201cFang Zhou, are you still going? Tomorrow? The day after? Or some other time\u2026\u201dMount Xian Teng\u2019s boundaries is extremely wide, so one more person doesn\u2019t hinder anyone\u2013 even if the boundary isn\u2019t wide, Lian Fang Zhou would still take Li Family\u2019s person with them.So she immediately nodded her head: \u201cAh Ze and I were planning to go tomorrow!\u201dShe didn\u2019t say anything about inviting Mrs Zhao because Aunt Zhang doesn\u2019t really approve this matter but the intention was clear.Mrs Zhao\u2019s eyes brightened and she couldn\u2019t help step forward and grab Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s arm: \u201cFang Zhou, can I come with you tomorrow? Even though I don\u2019t know anything but I can rely on you! I don\u2019t ask for much. Just want a chance to earn some pocket money and I\u2019ll be satisfied.\u201d*Sao-zi means sister-in-law, just a way to call someone elder and familiar with\u2019s wife, not really their elder brother\u2019s wife.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So turned toward Lian Fang Zhou, and said: \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t trouble you then\u2013\u201d\u201cHow could it be trouble? I\u2019m eager for Saozi to be my companion!\u201d Not waiting for Aunt Zhang to finish, Lian Fang Zhou smiled as she cut her off.She followed up: \u201cHowever, everyone knows that Mount Xian Teng isn\u2019t like ordinary woods. To be honest, Ah Ze and I don\u2019t dare to go to many places or too deep into the mountain. So Saozi, you also need to be careful as well.\u201dActually Mrs Zhao isn\u2019t a bad person, she just loves money too much. Lian Fang Zhou is afraid that when the come, she will recklessly wander off while collecting mushrooms. Since she is an adult, she can\u2019t really control her, and cannot be blamed if an accident happens. But it will be still attributed to her, because she led Mrs. Zhao to Mount Xian Teng.And later it would be awkward for the two families to meet.It\u2019s better to sternly warn before that happens.\u201cWhat you said is extremely right!\u201d Aunt Zhang nodded vigorously. She instructed Mrs Zhao: \u201cFang Zhou is more familiar with the area then you are. So you better listen to her. Don\u2019t wander recklessly! Or else if something happens, not only you would suffer, you would also implicate others!\u201dLian Fang Zhou rushed to say that she is too young to be a leader, but Mrs Zhao immediately accepted\u2014actually, in her heart, she protested: I\u2019m an adult, how could I not know how to act sensible?Mrs Zhao thought for a moment then pulled Li Juan over and turned toward Aunt Zhang:\u201cMother, how about letting little sis come with us as well! Fang Zhou and her are around the same age, they will have a great time talking with each other!\u201dLi Juan indeed wanted to go, so she smiled at Lian Fang Zhou and supported that idea.Aunt Zhang was vexed that Mrs Zhao has no good sense when to stop. She didn\u2019t want to agree, but she relented seeing her daughter\u2019s determination.\u201cThen it\u2019s agreed like this. No need to go really early tomorrow. Just after breakfast is fine! If there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019ll go back now!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou said as she stood up and left with the bag of chinese milk vetch seed in her hands.Aunt Zhang and Uncle Li told her goodbye adding \u2018be careful tomorrow\u2019.\u201cI\u2019ll send you off!\u201d Mrs Zhao very politely said with a smile.This actually happened for the first time ever! Lian Fang Zhou politely declined, but Mrs Zhao grabbed her arm ignoring her protest.Lian Fang Zhou could only smile.Mrs Zhao walked with her to the door and and said suddenly: \u201cOh that\u2019s right! Don\u2019t tell anyone about our outing! If a lot of people know, it\u2019ll be a small problem if we can\u2019t collect a lot. Even worse if something happens and they blame us!\u201dLian Fang Zhou realised that Mrs Zhao most likely sent her off just to say that to her.She would not tell others anyway so she agreed: \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201dOnly like this, could Mrs Zhao feel at ease and watch her leave.Third Aunt saw a bag that Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s brought with her and immediately asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cChinese milk vetch seed. It\u2019s used as green manure.\u201d Lian Fang Zhou calmly replied.Hearing this, Third Aunt lost her interest. She curled her lips as her expression become scornful and quietly grumble: \u201d Half a catty of pork in exchange for this\u2026\u201dLian Fang Zhou ignored that and called out Lian Che and Lian Fang Qing to bathe and go to sleep.She also enquired with the guy about his injuries. The guy just grinned: \u201cIt\u2019s no problem. Just superficial wounds.\u201dSeeing that his face and spirit seem fine, her worries were gone. So she let Lian Ze take him to their nook to sleep. [Editor note to be rejected: poor guy, nobody helps him bathe, heartless, Fang Zhou!]Early the next day, Lian Fang Zhou, Lian Ze, Mrs Zhao and Li Juan made their way to Mount Xian Teng.Right after they arrived Mrs Zhao and Li Juan were a bit scared but gradually their fear went away.Whenever Lian Fang Zhou chanced upon mushrooms, she would carefully tell them what kind it is and if it suitable for picking.Collecting mushrooms is completely different from cutting firewood.You need to wander around widely [they avoid dangerous parts!] when picking mushrooms.\u00a0One has to be perceptive, but also lucky.Originally with just Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze, it was more convenient. But now there\u2019s two more of them. Aftering walking for good while, they would only find one meager cluster. That\u2019s when it\u2019s hard to split.And also Mrs Zhao is a greedy person. Everytime they come across mushrooms, she rushes over to be the first to reach them. With an expression \u2018this is mine\u2019, she asks Lian Fang Zhou: \u201cCan one pick them?\u201dLian Fang Zhou wouldn\u2019t selfishly hide from her, but if this keeps up, even with full day effort, she and Lian Ze won\u2019t be able to gather much.After thinking about it,Lian Fang Zhou then spoke out: \u201cIt isn\u2019t really convenient for the four of us so far. How about this? Saozi and Ah Juan come with me and Ah Ze goes gather by himself. Let\u2019s agree on a time to meet and not be late.\u201dLian Ze is a male, even though he\u2019s young, he should manage alone.Lian Ze wanted to walk off long time ago. Honestly he doesn\u2019t like Mrs Zhao. Before Mrs Zhao gave them a lot of frowns and cold eyes. He knows very well why she came with them today.Li Juan also felt Sister-in-law\u2019s actions are very embarrassing. Hearing Lian Fang Zhou say this, she agreed. However Mrs Zhao doesn\u2019t.Internally Mrs Zhao believes Lian Fang Zhou is taking them to wander around the mountain, while letting Lian Ze pick up the valuable one.\u201cIt isn\u2019t such a good idea. Won\u2019t Ah Ze become lonely?\u00a0How about this, Fang Zhou, you and Ah Juan go together and I go with Lian Ze!\u201d Mrs Zhao smiled slyly.Lian Ze\u2019s face immediately darkened a lot hearing this. Did he hear it wrong? Mrs Zhao actually want to go with him?Lian Fang Zhou froze. Now thinking about it, could only do this. It\u2019s better than letting Li Juan going with Lian Ze.\u201cThen\u2026 it\u2019s alright!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou nodded. Then turned to Lian Ze with a smile and said: \u201cAh Ze, you look after Saozi Zhao. And also don\u2019t be greedy and go far. Make sure to come back in time!\u201dLian Ze helplessly look at Lian Fang Zhou. It\u2019s hard to refuse sister\u2019s words, so he could only glumly agree.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go then! We should move while it\u2019s early, this way we can gather more!\u201d Mrs Zhao grinned happily at Lian Ze.\u201cSister, be careful!\u201d Lian Ze said to Lian Fang Zhou as he waved goodbye and left with Mrs Zhao.\u201cWe should also go then!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled at Li Juan after seeing them leave.\u201cOk,\u201d Li Juan nodded and shot her an embarrassed smile. Honestly, Sister-in-law is\u2013, but she couldn\u2019t apologize for her\u2013it is not for her to say it!While Lian Fang Zhou just laugh it off and pressed her hand to show it\u2019s fine.The two of them exchanged glances and bursted with laughter. In that moment they felt a lot closer.When the time to meet arrived, Lian Fang Zhou and Li Juan came out first. Not long later, Mrs Zhao and Lian Ze also came.\u201cOh, it\u2019s time to go back already? From what I see, it\u2019s still early!\u201d Mrs Zhao laughed out.Lian Fang Zhou replied: \u201cSaozi, you should be very clear that it gets dark faster in the mountain forest. If we don\u2019t leave now, there\u2019s a chance we\u2019ll bump into ferocious beasts looking for prey. Then it\u2019s hard to handle!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right Sister-in-law! And the road back is still long!\u201d Li Juan followed up.Mrs Zhao saw that her sister-in-law also spoke out, there\u2019s nothing else she could say. So she purposely glance at Li Juan\u2019s sack and Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s. With a laugh, she purposely lightly pointed out: \u201cAh Juan is new to this and she picked very little! Compare to Lian Fang Zhou, it\u2019s a lot less!\u201dThe underlying meaning is very clear: Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t take care of Li Juan!\u00a0Clearly, she took advantage of her!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 41": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Picking Up a General to Plow the FieldsChapter 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMaggie_When Lian Ze returned with Mrs Zhao, he was irritated already and her snippy comment made him seething.\u00a0Standing behind her, he lifted his eyes and shot a glare at her.Li Juan\u2019s face turned red when she heard it. She blurted with embarrassed anger: \u201cIs Sister-in-law complaining that I am too slow? But I could only move this fast. I guess I shouldn\u2019t come at all then!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that!\u201d Mrs Zhao became anxious when Li Juan took the criticism to herself. She looked over at Lian Fang Zhou with an embarrassed smile. She felt that Lian Fang Zhu would help explain her intention, given how polite and easy-going she became.But Lian Fang Zhou just stood on a side looking down at something as if she never heard her speak.Lian Fang Zhou stood close to her and Li Juan and the forest around them was really quiet. Everyone, including Mrs Zhao, knew Lian Fang Zhou is merely acting as if she did not hear anything.Lian Fang Zhu did it deliberately. She had no debt of gratitude to Mrs Zhao just because Aunt Zhang and Uncle Li were so nice. She doesn\u2019t need to lower her head in front of Mrs Zhao.Mrs Zhao is \u201cgain an inch, want a foot\u201d person. If she yields to her, it will only create trouble in the future.If Mrs Zhao has any requests, as long as they are not too bothersome, she would agree. But her words were overboard, hardly different from saying it out straight.In fact, Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t take advantage of Li Juan. Whenever they chanced upon mushrooms she would call Li Juan to collect them together.At home, Li Juan was doted by her parents and brother, so she never done any hardwork before. Today she joined their mountain hike mostly to see something new, so after collecting for a bit, she lost interest and her hands became slower.However for Lian Fang Zhou it is not an outing but hard work to get enough money for her family.\u00a0She wants to pick as many mushrooms as she can before the start of winter and to sell them over the New Year.Next year they need to buy different kinds of seeds, tools and rent a bullock for the field work. Which doesn\u2019t require money?So of course the two of them ended up with different amounts.Mrs Zhao saw that Lian Fang Zhou was ignoring her, understood that her words were a bit overboard. Her cheeks flamed up slightly from embarrassment while secretly she was thinking:My parents-in-law help you a lot, right? Especially my mother, who nearly raised you like a real daughter! You should help me save face!Even though in her heart she was displeased, Mrs Zhao kept it to herself. Hearing Li Juan say she won\u2019t come tomorrow, she was afraid of trouble so she said quickly: \u201cSister-in-law misunderstood. It was a joke! A joke! Ah Juan don\u2019t be mad! Hehe, isn\u2019t that right Fang Zhou?\u201dOnly then did Lian Fang Zhou opened her mouth: \u201cIf Saozi was joking, then it\u2019s fine. Or else I don\u2019t know how I could ever face Aunt Zhang! It\u2019s better if Saozi doesn\u2019t say words like this in future. I can\u2019t take such scare!\u201dMrs Zhao, even more ashamed, quickly replied: \u201cI won\u2019t, I won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThen that\u2019s good! I can rest at ease now! Otherwise, I would have to apologise to Aunt Zhang!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou grinned.Meaning, if you speak nonsense again, then don\u2019t blame me for telling off.Lian Fang Zhou was actually really worried about Mrs Zhao\u2019s pratling. Once or twice it\u2019s no problem. Even if Aunt Zhang and Uncle Li know her personality well, if it happens a lot the relationship would suffer. Then it would be terrible.Mrs Zhao paused. Her heart rapidly beat, as she felt a bit afraid out of nowhere.Not waiting for her to respond, Li Juan has already grasped Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s and said in a complaining tone: \u201cFang Zhou what are you saying? It\u2019s not that serious!\u201d\u201cI was just worried!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou half-serious replied Li Juan. \u201cI don\u2019t some grudge to appear between our two families. Isn\u2019t it good that we can all live in harmony? Your family has helped us a lot. If conflict were to happen, I really don\u2019t know what to do with the unease in my heart.\u201d\u201cYou thinking too much. It definitely won\u2019t happen!\u201d Li Juan quickly followed up. And turned to Mrs Zhao: \u201cIsn\u2019t that right Sister-in-law?\u201dMrs Zhao suddenly thought of how Lian Fang Zhou doesn\u2019t really have it easy. And her behavior improved a lot.Before, she only know how to ask for things from her family and her family\u2019s help was never paid back.Now? Yesterday, she gave them half a catty of meat!Mrs Zhao silently sighed. She couldn\u2019t help regret saying those words a moment ago and thought:it\u2019s embarrassing to be petty with a girl a lot younger than me.\u201cFang Zhou, Saozi really doesn\u2019t mean it, you-\u201d\u201cSaozi, say no more!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou hearing her say it like this, she knew she has already thought it through.\u00a0It was better not to let her finish, so she quickly said with a smile: \u201cSaozi was joking, I get it. It\u2019s pretty late, we should get on moving.\u201dMrs Zhao paused and then the knot inside her loosened. She laughed: \u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Just joking!\u201dSaying this, the three young women burst out laughing.Lian Fang Zhou called over Lian Ze and the four of them made their way back.Once Fang Zhou and Ah Ze entered the yard, they saw the guy they rescued chopping firewood and Third Aunt with hands on hips as she talked I do not understand, who was she talking too?\u00a0If unclear, delete after \u201chips\u201d.\u201cOh, you have return! How did it go? Gathered a lot? Hey, quickly come over and take them!\u201d Seeing Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze, Third Aunt cheerfully greeted them and then hollered toward the man while glaring at him. As if blaming him for not being tactful.The man answered and clapped his hands. He walked over to Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze.After few steps, he suddenly stopped:who should I go over to first? Logically Lian Ze is younger so he should take his. But Lian Fang Zhou is a female. Female can\u2019t handle heavy work. But, if he take Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s just because she is a female, he need to avoid being obvious.So such a simple matter put the guy in such a dilemma.\u201cOh, why are you still standing there! Not one bit clever at all!\u201d Third Aunt yelled with unhappily.\u201cThird Aunt!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze already put their shoulder pole down. Lian Fang Zhou frowned, said with displeasure to Third Aunt: \u201cHow could you order him around? He\u2019s still recovering and anyhow he had saved us, didn\u2019t he?\u201dThird Aunt was about to explain herself but the man quickly exclaimed: \u201cEldest Miss, it\u2019s no problem! My injuries are fine, and they were superficial to begin with, nothing serious!\u00a0This minor work does not hurt at all.\u201d\u201cEldest Miss?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s voice contained some bewilderment. She glared at Third Aunt: No need to ask. Such strange way of addressing someone is definitely Third Aunt\u2019s work! He isn\u2019t their servant, so how could she make him address them like this?Lian Fang Zhou was furious:To treat a saviour like this, not only her own conscience won\u2019t allow it, but one has to consider the children too. Lian Ze is fine, as he could tell what\u2019s right or wrong since he\u2019s not little anymore. But what if Qing\u2019er and Che\u2019er learn from her and in future grow up in the wrong direction?What if the little ones learn from example!\u00a0Who knows what other amazing examples Third Aunt could produce.\u201cAh Ze, quickly take this sir inside to let him rest!\u201d She must have a good talk with Third Aunt.\u201cOk,\u201d Lian Ze looked over at Third Aunt and then he took the man inside.That guy reflexively glanced at Lian Fang Zhou. Seeing that her expression wasn\u2019t good, with sudden realisation he felt a bit afraid. He didn\u2019t dare disobey her words and went inside with Lian Ze.Third Aunt felt a bit guilty and with an ashamed tone she said: \u201cUm, it\u2019s about time to make dinner. I\u2019ll go to the vegetable patch and gather some veg\u2026\u201d\u201cStop!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou gave a low shout. In few steps she was in front of Third Aunt. With a heavy face, she asked: \u201cWhy are you ordering him around today, Third Aunt?\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t ordering around!\u201d Third Aunt quickly explained: \u201cHe asked if there was any way he could help, and then I\u2026\u201dLian Fang Zhou felt so frustrated like it felt like a chicken talking to a duck. She thought,\u2018Third Aunt ah! You aren\u2019t a three year old child. They are being polite when they ask like that. How could you take advantage and take it seriously?\u2019\u201cAnd then?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou gritted her teeth as she asked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now at Lian Family, she felt more and more comfortable\u2013even though from the start Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t allow her to be the head. So it\u2019s better to honestly admit her misdeeds!In one day, Third Aunt really outdid herself. Cleaning the yard and chopping the firewoods was the guy\u2019s work. While she at it, she told him to husk the rice. Afterward hearing from Lian Fang Qing that the taro have yet to be harvested, she took him to the field. And she ordered him to dig them out, carry it back and even hang them on the beam of the corridor.\u201cWHAT!?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cYou actually told him to work in the field? How could you do that!\u201d\u201cNo. It wasn\u2019t me!\u201d Third Aunt saw that Lian Fang Zhou was absolutely furious, she immediately became anxious. She rushed to explain. \u201cHe, he came to tell me that he wanted to go to the nearby mountains to pick some medicinal herbs for his wounds. So I thought he\u2019s going to the mountains, might as well let him\u2026 on the way\u2026on the way\u2026\u201dLian Fang Zhou felt with Third Aunt, she really didn\u2019t know what to say! She stamped her feet as she angrily scold: \u201cWhat good things you have done! He even said he\u2019s picking medicinal herbs for his wounds and you still made him do manual labour! Third Aunt, if it spreads out how we treat our saviour, what will people think of us then? And also, Qing\u2019er and Che\u2019er are still young. If they learn from this example, you\u2019ll ruin them! If something like that happens again, Third Aunt, we dare not let you stay.\u201dThird\u00a0Aunt was irritated that Lian Fang Zhou keeping using these words, but that was her weakness. So no matter how mad, she could only endure. Except for that threat, Lian Fan Zhou always treated her fairly. Way better than her husband\u2019s family.So Third Aunt grudgingly answered: \u201cI understand, I understand.\u201dLian Fang Zhou, still extremely annoyed, continued on: \u201cYou should sincerely mean it. Don\u2019t just agree with mouth! Didn\u2019t you want to go to the vegetable patch? Go on!\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Third Aunt nodded. Then all of a sudden, she came closer to Lian Fang Zhou again.\u201cFrom what I see, why don\u2019t we let the guy stay. The guy got endless amount of energy. He\u2019s good at manual work and also honest and obedient\u2013\u201dSeeing Lian Fang Zhou pointedly glare at her, she shrunk her neck and immediately dropped the subject: \u201cI\u2019m going to the veggie patch!\u201d\u201cReally\u2014\u201d Lian Fang Zhou let out a long sigh. She swiftly washed her hands and face and patted dust off her before turning away from the house, to go to the village.She was going to ask for some medicinal tincture for the guy. Originally she said she would get it for today but who knew that she completely forgot once she went out early this morning. Causing him to find some medicinal herbs by himself. And be conveniently exploited by Third Aunt\u2013Then again, she also have some fault in this too.But unexpectedly this guy, who forgot he himself was, actually understood herbal medicine?Very soon Lian Fang Zhou returned and entered the house with a vial of a medicinal tincture in hand.The guy was sitting in the middle of the room talking with Lian Ze and the two little ones. The twins were curious about the events on that day when he rescued their family. The children kept asking questions.Seeing Lian Fang Zhou enter, they stopped talking and greeted: \u201cSister!\u201dLian Fang Zhou acknowledged them and continued: I have something to talk about with this uncle, you guys go back to your room.\u201dThe three of them agreed as they stood up. Lian Fang Qing cheekily winked at her sister. She giggled as she corrected: \u201cIt\u2019s not uncle. It\u2019s big brother!\u201dLian Fang Zhou came to a stop. The lass has already entered her room with a laugh. She could only helplessly laugh.Lian Fang Zhou tightened her grip on the vial and held it out to him. With a very apologetic smile, she said: \u201cOriginally I should have gotten the medicinal tincture in the morning. But it flew out of my mind. Here, take it and rub on your wounds.\u201dThe guy smiled: \u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you Eldest Miss!\u00a0My wounds are really superficial. When Third Aunt asked me to help with digging taro, I happened to see some herbs I could use by the mountain side and picked some.\u00a0When I came back, I ground them in the pestle and I smeared them on my skin. . I just need to apply it a few more times and it\u2019ll be better. There\u2019s really no need to trouble Eldest Miss.\u201dHearing this, Lian Fang Zhou gritted her teeth: Third Aunt actually lied to her face!\u00a0She slyly reversed the order of events!\u201cJust take it!\u00a0A tincture is more effective than raw herbs!\u201d Not letting any room for discussion, Lian Fang Zhou placed the vial into his hand. Then with some embarrassment: \u201cYou saved us, so you\u2019re our benefactor. Just rest properly. If Third Aunt tells you to do any more work, you don\u2019t need to bother with her. I\u2019m the head of this family, so don\u2019t mind her! And also, don\u2019t call me Eldest Miss. Call me\u2026 Miss Lian!\u201dLian Fang Zhou suddenly remember Third Aunt mention letting him stay. She immediately felt a bit out of place and guilty and thought: The person in front of me is obviously our saviour. But was made into a servant by that unreliable Third Aunt.Seeing the situation, the guy accept the vial and gave his thanks and kept speaking: \u201cMiss, Miss Lian. Please don\u2019t blame Madam Third Aunt, she\u2013\u201d\u201cMadam Third Aunt!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou was filled with rage. She immediately felt an impulse to teach Third Aunt a good lesson\u2013so embarrassing!\u201cOur family don\u2019t have any Madam Third Aunt,\u201d Lian Fang Zhou done her best to make her expression pleasant. With a slight smile: \u201cIn future please don\u2019t use such way of addressing. If other people hear, they\u2019ll be bent double laughing. Just like we are doing, call her Third Aunt!\u201dAfraid that Third Aunt would still say nonsense behind her back in future, with a stern face, she said: \u201cListen carefully, in this house, I make the decisions. It\u2019s enough if you just listen to me! If Third Aunt ever tell you to do something again, come discuss it with me first!\u201dThe guy didn\u2019t care much about these title matters, so he agreed with no second thoughts. Then continuing the previous topic: \u201cAs a matter of fact, I really only have some superficial injuries. It\u2019s really not hard for me to work, so don\u2019t blame Third Aunt!\u201dWith a sheepish grin, \u201cHonestly speaking, it\u2019s a fact that you saved me. So it\u2019s only right that I work for you.\u201dLian Fang Zhou gave a gentle sigh: It\u2019s better to stop here, cause if we keep quarrelling about this matter, no telling when we\u2019ll reach an agreement.\u201cThen let\u2019s say we don\u2019t owe each other! So in future, let\u2019s not mention it, alright? Now relax while you nurse your injuries!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou grinned and decided to go see how Third Aunt is doing with the dinner.Though his injuries weren\u2019t serious, he\u2019s still not completely well. No matter what Lian Fang Zhou doesn\u2019t have the heart to tell him to leave.\u201cMiss Lian!\u201d The guy called out to stop her. His voice sounded a bit desperate.Lian Fang Zhou halted and turned around. \u201cIs there something that concerns you? If you have any requests, don\u2019t hesitate to ask!\u201dAlthough he looked unusual, he did not seem to be a person that could use blackmail or tricks to gain an advantage. That\u2019s why Lian Fang Zhou said this completely straightforwardly and happily.\u201cNo matter what request, Miss Lian will promise me?\u201d The guy\u2019s eyes brightened up and he as he quickly followed up. This made Lian Fang Zhou felt like he was waiting for her to say these words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Of course you can!\u201d The guy was so agitated that he unexpectedly stood up. Looking at Lian Fang Zhou he earnestly said, \u201cMiss Lian, can you take me in?\u201d\u201cWh\u2026What!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou froze as her mind exploded.\u201cCan you take me in?\u201d The guy looked at her earnestly as he asked and continued: \u201cI won\u2019t eat free food. I can work for you!\u00a0I am very robust, so no work is too hard for me! I just want\u2026a place to shelter from the wind and rain. Can you promise me?\u201dThe guy himself also didn\u2019t understand why he would make this kind of request, even after regaining his memory many years later.In the end, he could only think of it as: This should be fate, right? Somehow it\u2019s heaven at work!He got strong body and his look was very honest and sincere. As he wandered, so many people were persuading him to stay at their place but he tactfully declined all. But after reaching Lian Family\u2019s place, he actually don\u2019t want to leave. Not even one step.The pair of bright deep black eyes gazed at her earnestly. His aura and attitude were full of sincerity. This made Lian Fang Zhou immediately look away, not daring to look him\u2013rejecting him would made you feel guilty and wrong.\u201cSister, let Big Brother stay!\u201d Unable to endure it anymore, Lian Ze came out of the room and spoke: \u201d Now it\u2019s already late autumn and winter is coming soon. Where could Big Brother go to survive winter?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! That\u2019s right, Sister! Winter is really cold! Really cold!\u201d\u201cSister, Big Brother is a good person. Let him stay!\u201dLian Fang Qing and Lian Che also came over to help speak for the guy.The three siblings all talking combined with that guy\u2019s eagered gaze made Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s head spin. She felt like she nearly can\u2019t take it all.She can\u2019t help but feel curious: ever since Lian Ze saw the guy\u2019s martial art, his eyes kept on shining, so she know what he was planning. But the two little ones, why are they helping him with such gusto?She didn\u2019t know that Lian Ze said this behind her back: \u201cHis martial art is very powerful. If he stay at our home, nobody would dare bully us, or bully sister! \u201d And this completely persuaded Lian Fang Qing and Lian CheWhile the three young one plead enthusiastically, Third Aunt popped in from outside and also spoke out: \u201cFang Zhou, let him stay then! The guy, he got so much strength. So it\u2019s perfect if he stays and works! With just you and Lian Ze, there\u2019s a lot of work you can\u2019t do\u2026 Well, I\u2019m just stating the truth!\u201dSeeing Lian Fang Zhou glare at her, Third Aunt bitterly added the last sentence.Lian Fang Zhou got a headache from all their noise and with addition to the guy\u2019s earnest expression, her heart softened. Unable to refrain from nodding, she spoke: \u201cAlright! Then\u2026 we\u2019ll talk about it after winter passes!\u201dAlthough the guy looks honest, but to know one\u2019s face is not to know one\u2019s heart!She got to defend against the chance of it happening.Lian Fang Zhou avoided a definite answer and kept an advantage for talking about it in future. Secondly, let him be mentally warned: I did not promise to let you stay!Lian Fang Zhou also glanced at Third Aunt and thought that it was the right choice to let Third Aunt stay at the beginning! If Third Aunt wasn\u2019t here, with just them four siblings, they can\u2019t take him in no matter how pitiful he was.Without any adult in the house, letting an unknown young man stay at their home while she is fifteen years old, those rumors and gossips could kill her!With Third Aunt here, it\u2019s different.Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che are still young, so they didn\u2019t understand the meaning of Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s words and kept on vigorously making a scene. They were so focused that they did not see that a smile already appearing on Lian Ze\u2019s face.Third Aunt clapped her hands as she laughed: \u201cYou two are really silly. Why make a ruckus? Your sister already agreed!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Both Lian Fang Qing and Lian Ze were surprised and full of joy as they looked at her.Lian Fang Zhou grinned: \u201cFor now, it\u2019s like this.\u201dThe three siblings shouted out in joy. The guy was also surprised and happy. He kept on thanking her.Third Aunt smiled like a cheshire cat: we got a free worker to boss around! That\u2019s splendid!The most important thing is that this guy is very polite to her, willing to listen to her. This is really, really perfect!\u201cYou\u2019re welcome!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou grinned. Seeing that everyone this happy, she also felt happy as well, nice and warm inside.\u201cAh, since the big guy wants to stay in our home, he\u2019ll need a name, right?\u201d Third Aunt suddenly mentioned.Big guy?Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s brow slightly, very slightly pinched. In her mind, she subconsciously imagined how Third Aunt high and mightily called him \u2018big guy\u2019 as she ordered him to work for the whole day today and felt she done him wrong.\u201cHe should have a name!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou nodded.Third Aunt couldn\u2019t believe that Lian Fang Zhou actually didn\u2019t vetoed her words\u2014 she didn\u2019t think how there\u2019s no reason to reject the idea.With the newfound energy, she spoke with a very self-conceited smile: \u201cI have already thought of a name, let\u2019s call him Yuan Bao (means: a shaped ingot of gold or silver, used as money or as a gift for luck and prosperity, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sycee)!\u201dLian Fang Zhou immediately started coughing\u2014she choked on her own spit!\u201cNo way! Too showy!\u201d Lian glared at Third Aunt with outrage. Beside refuting her, she also have another meaning: if you don\u2019t know how to adjust, then talk less!What kind of name is this! She felt too embarrassed to even said it.Big guy doesn\u2019t really care about what he is called. Hmm\u2026however, his personal opinion is that he also doesn\u2019t like this name.He turned to Lian Fang Zhou, with a sheepish smile: \u201cHow about Miss Lian give me a name! Feel free to call me whatever, it\u2019s fine as long as it\u2019s convenient to say.\u201dGiving a name is an important matter, so of course it\u2019s more suitable for the family head handling it. The three younger siblings kept their mouth closed and they all stared at Lian Fang Zhou.Lian Fang Zhou gave it some thought, then spoke out: \u201cLet\u2019s call you Ah Jian then!\u201d\u201cAlright, from now on, I\u2019m called Ah Jian!\u201d The big guy grinned as he nodded.Naturally the three little one would agree with it. They then called out with a smile: \u201cBig Brother Jian!\u201d\u201cAh Jian!\u201d Third Aunt also called out once but also mumbled quietly: \u201cI still feel that Yuan Bao sounds nicer\u2026\u201dThe three little ones didn\u2019t hear her and continued greeting Ah Jian. Lian Fang Zhou heard it and pretend she didn\u2019t hear her.\u201cThat\u2019s all now. Time to eat! Everybody, don\u2019t you feel hungry?\u201d Lian Fang Zou chuckled as she commented.\u201cLet\u2019s eat! Let\u2019s eat!\u201d The children then started become busy as they grabbed the bowls and moved the stools. The swaying human shadows from faint yellow light were filled with faint warmth.After that, Ah Jian stayed in Lian Family\u2019s home, sharing the room with the Lian brothers. To others, they say he is a distant relative of their mother. His family got no land, so firstly he came over to find a shelter and secondly to help the Lian siblings.After Mrs Qiao found out, she once hid somewhere to secretly observe Ah Jian and saw that he is tall and strong. With one glance, she could tell he is filled with endless energy and not the kind that is thieving, crafty and lazy.Immediately Mrs Qiao felt upset and extremely envious.Maybe spread some rumors behind their back\u2013 without thinking, it\u2019s obvious what kinds of words they are.Lian Ze was boiling with anger. He wanted to immediately go to Uncle\u2019s house to ask for an explanation.Inside, he is filled with remorse and regret: if he knew that letting Ah Jian would cause such trouble, he probably wouldn\u2019t have said those words! But\u2026Ah Jian felt terrible when he found out and was silent the whole day. Then turned to Lian Fang Zhou to bid farewell.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She told him: \u201cYou\u2019re completely innocent. You are dignified and rightly staying at our home. I\u2019m not even afraid, so why would you? If you left at this time, wouldn\u2019t it make it even more unexplainable! It\u2019s better that you stay. After a while, everyone will naturally understand your character.\u201dNot know why, but the appearance of Ah Jian is visible evidence right now. Whoever saw him before would realize he is a straightforward and upright person. Even Aunt Zhang didn\u2019t say anything about him staying in their home out of goodwill.Not only does Lian Fang Zhou persist on Ah Jian staying, but she also didn\u2019t allow Lian Ze go to bother Mrs. Qiao. Instead, she troubled Third Aunt to instigate.Third Aunt looked forward to the chance of going to Mrs. Qiao and berated her. She clapped her hands in joy and said to Lian Fang Zhou before heading to Lian Li\u2019s house: \u201cFang Zhou, wait right there! That wicked heart dead bitch, she can\u2019t stand seeing others well off!\u201dThird Aunt headed to Lian Li and Mrs. Qiao\u2019s yard and sat at the entrance. She slapped her thigh and started wailing. Crying that her brother and sister-in-law are heartless, seeing that she is suffering and ignore it. With much difficulties, she finally settled down at her nieces\u2019 and nephews,\u2019 and they started to instigate incidents with all possible method again. They can\u2019t stand seeing her well off and start a rumor to create trouble, ruining the nieces\u2019 and nephews\u2019 reputation. How frightening these intentions are, to not care about the blood relationship between them.Initially, Third Aunt\u2019s sharp tongue is very unforgiving, that\u2019s why there\u2019s discord between her and her in-law. Before coming here, she got some pointer from Lian Fang Zhou, and she is also someone who goes all out and harbor deep hatred toward Mrs. Qiao. So she spares no effort when she bawled.She cried and yelled at the top of lungs by herself, not caring that Mrs. Qiao can\u2019t discern what is happening. Everyone spectating felt pity for her the more they hear her complain in tears and started whispering. The eyes glancing at Mrs. Qiao changed.Seeing the situation, Lian Li and Mrs. Qiao became angry, distressed and mad. They were impatient to pull Third Aunt into the house and then talk.It\u2019s just that there\u2019s the ethic of no close contact between male and female once they\u2019re seven, even if Lian Li is her older brother. He is still a male. Also though the countryside isn\u2019t very particular about virtues, but the main rules still cannot be broken. Under everyone\u2019s gazes, it\u2019s not convenient for him to pull Third Aunt himself.First, let\u2019s not talk about the problem of manners, but he\u2019s very sure if he dares to reach out his hand to pull, his sister will take the opportunity to wail out slanders.No other way, only Mrs. Qiao could up to pull her. Mrs. Qiao even hoped for Third Aunt to resist. Making a move to fight with her would be even better.However this time, Third Aunt became clever, when Mrs. Qiao came to pull her, she dodged instead of resisting. Not going as Mrs. Qiao wished, starting a fight.Mrs. Qiao became mad and anxious. Both hands held her arm in a death grip and yelled. \u201cI say, Third Aunt, if you have something to say then stand up first! Making a scene like this, what does it look like? Don\u2019t act so shamelessly! Even if you don\u2019t give us face, at least save your face!\u201d\u201cAHH\u2026 AHH..\u201d Third Aunt screamed in pain. As she struggled, she yelled: \u201cLet go, let me go! You\u2019re squeezing me to death! It hurt like hell!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t even\u2026\u201d Hearing Third Aunt was shouting and yelling as she accused her, Mrs. Qiao was so angry. Just when she about refuted her, a \u2018rip\u2019 could be heard. Third Aunt\u2019s sleeve has been torn off by her!Mrs. Qiao was immediately stunned on the spot.Third Aunt quickly took back her arm, and shouted even louder: \u201cSister-in-law! How vicious! Don\u2019t think because you have a son studying for xiucai exam, that you can act so condescending! I let you know since you treat your sister-in-law so black-hearted like this, other people could say \u2018How could a son from this family possibly have any good character or conduct? And also what qualification to take the Xiucai exam?\u2019. Then your son can forget about it. Under everyone\u2019s face, you dare secretly viciously pinch me, wring my flesh and rip off my clothes. If no one were here, then wouldn\u2019t you have killed me? I \u2026 I shall go to the County School and discuss with the school teacher tomorrow!\u201dThird Aunt smirked inside. If she didn\u2019t make perfect preparation, would she have come? If Mrs. Qiao didn\u2019t make a move, then it\u2019s okay. But once she makes her move, her clothes would split into a big gap.Seeing Mrs. Qiao\u2019s face going from green to white from anger, Third Aunt was delighted inside!Everyone spectating couldn\u2019t help gasp and looked at each other: Mrs. Qiao have a venomous heart! In the beginning, she was resolute in not letting sister-in-law enter. Now she even tore off sister-in-law\u2019s clothes and also wring her. Really-Immediately someone came over and supported Third Aunt up and with light and sweet voice, she comforts her. And they also helped sort out the clothes and hair.Remembering Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s words, Third Aunt immediately made her appearance pitiful with the trickling tears and choking weep. Wanting to cry but not as she gave her thanks. This made everyone sighed continuously.Mrs. Qiao was having a fit. She has never be wronged like this before. Seeing Third Aunt like this, she was so mad that her blood pressure was rising. Pointing at her, she yelled with hatred: \u201cYou dead shrew, pretending to be pitiful! Just now, who didn\u2019t see you being so unruly? There\u2019s no use acting! I didn\u2019t pinch you and also didn\u2019t use any strength. Your clothes were flimsy. Now you\u2019re blaming this old lady!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t want people to live!\u201d Immediately Third Aunt covered her face and sobbed: \u201cThe reason I was unruly is that if I don\u2019t be unruly how do I deal with people like you? It was you ripping my clothes, and now you turn it around to bite me. Truly vicious! Tomorrow I must go to the county academy and ask the teacher, how could a son raised by this family take xiucai exam and become an official? The proverb is right, those in subordinate positions will follow the example set by their superiors. If he gets the Xiucai, then wouldn\u2019t it be worse! Don\u2019t talk about me; even the whole village be bully to death by your family!\u201dWhen they heard this, everyone faces wholly changed, and all can\u2019t help but discuss. Started talking about Mrs. Qiao being at fault.Initially, everyone towards Mrs. Qiao boasting about her son having good grades at the county academy and usually receive the teacher\u2019s compliment, felt envious. Now hearing these words, how could it not become worse? And what\u2019s more, if her son passes Xiucai and becomes an official in the future, let\u2019s not talking about him, just with his parents, who knows how they would bully people!Hearing this, Lian Li also become a bit perturbed. He went up and roared at Third Aunt: \u201cDon\u2019t speak nonsense here! Hmph, you think anyone can enter the county\u2019s academy just because they want to? The teacher there care about the grades, what does it have to with other things? Hmph, if you have the skills then go try!\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Third Aunt raised her voice: \u201cThis is what you said! Tomorrow I\u2019ll go. Wait for it. I\u2019ll go! I don\u2019t believe I can\u2019t get into the academy and can\u2019t ask the teacher!\u201dIt\u2019s not that Third Aunt isn\u2019t fearful inside. What kind of place is the county academy? How could she dare throw a fit there?But Lian Fang Zhou said it wouldn\u2019t be a problem to tell it like this, so she picks up her courage saying this.Initially, Lian Li just wanted to scare her, thinking that if he says it like this and she\u2019ll become afraid. Instead, it provokes her to go. Internally Lian Li became even more agitated.Especially when he recalls the current Lian Fang Zhou, don\u2019t know why he believes Lian Fang Zhou is someone who isn\u2019t afraid of trouble.He started to feel regrets, if he knew early why would he say such ruthless words to stimulate Third Aunt?If they take the matter to the academy, first let\u2019s not talk about who\u2019s wrong, it would affect his son! And more or less, from the beginning, his wife is in the wrong in this matterLet\u2019s not discuss whether she pinched Third Aunt or not, but she indeed did rip Third Aunt\u2019s sleeve! Can\u2019t even deny it since everyone saw it.If Third Aunt was provoked to go, then it\u2019s hard to say what\u2019ll happen to his son\u2019s future.At this moment Lian Li resent Mrs. Qiao to death. Now really don\u2019t know what to do.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And she kept on saying that sister-in-law is bullying her, a pitiful woman with a deceased husband and no home to return to as she cried so tragically.Mrs. Qiao was jumping mad.\u201cShut your mouth!\u201d Suddenly Lian Li thought of something, he glared at Mrs. Qiao and bellowed. With no room for discussion, he raised his hand and gave her two big slap and scolded: \u201cI really can\u2019t stand it anymore, are you treating me like a dead man? Because thinking of all these years of marriage, I endure and endure. In the hope that a family in harmony will prosper. While you, the more I let you be, the more ruckus you make! No matter what, Xiao Man is my little sister. You continuously insult her, do you even place me in your eyes?\u201dWith just a few sentences, Lian Li push all the blame to Mrs. Qiao\u2019s shoulders. Including last time, that was Mrs. Qiao\u2019s idea.\u201cYou\u2026you!\u201d Mrs. Qiao was stunned. She stared at Lian with wide eyes in disbelief. He slapped her! For that little bitch, he hit her in front of so many people.Her two cheeks started to sting painfully, then she recovered her wits and yelled as she hysterically rushed at Lian Li: \u201cI\u2019ll fight it out with you!\u201dAt this moment, she is mad with fury inside. Her movement also carries a hint of unrestrained rage. With one charge, she caused Lian Li to crashed to the ground.Deeply angered, Lian Li scolded her a dead bitch, can\u2019t even see the hint, useless!Compare to a son\u2019s clean reputation and future, what does this little flesh suffering worth? Who told her to scold other and made a move and create a weakness? If he doesn\u2019t hit her as a show to calm Third Aunt\u2019s anger, then tomorrow she would go to the County with that dead girl, Lian Fang Zhou. Everything would over if it implicates son\u2019s reputation and future.\u201cYou still dare retaliate!\u201d In a very sorry state, Lian Li drag himself up from the ground. He seized Mrs. Qiao\u2019s arm and hollered: \u201cSee if I divorce you!\u201dWhile Lian Li scold and shout at her, he kept on giving her winks. But at this moment, Mrs. Qiao is entirely crazy, On top of that Lian Li was trying not let other see the hint. So Mrs. Qiao didn\u2019t see the not so obvious wink. She crazily screamed as well as sobbingly yelled as she continuously clawed and kicked.Mrs. Qiao only knows that under everyone gaze, she has suffered her husband\u2019s merciless scolding and two slaps. Right now, she wants to slap him back for revenge viciously.When Lian Li said divorce her, Mrs. Qiao\u2019s whole body was rooted to the spot. Inside she was frightened, then followed by more resentment: For him, she birthed a son, and for him, she diligently manages the family for so many years. Now he said he wants to divorce her!\u201cYou heartless man! You\u2026 what have I done wrong for you to said such heartless words! Tomorrow I\u2019ll go reason with my son! I can\u2019t live anymore! Can\u2019t live anymore!\u201d Sitting down, Mrs. Qiao slapped the ground as she wailed.In this age, women are afraid of divorce the most. Especially Mrs. Qiao, whose age is very big. If she was divorced, first let\u2019s not mentioned she couldn\u2019t hold her head up, she also doesn\u2019t even have a place for shelter.Even if she has her maternal family, just by looking at Third Aunt, you\u2019ll know it isn\u2019t easy to return to the maternal family. So what if she has brothers, there\u2019s also sisters-in-law! No one would be willing to give their food to take care of a married off daughter for free.So when Lian Li said the word divorce, Mrs. Qiao was scared inside. Her courage was no longer like a while ago and also dare not hit Lian Li.Everyone hearing Lian Li says this was startled. Everyone look at each other: Words like divorce isn\u2019t something lightly mentioned. They can\u2019t help also have some opinion about Lian Li. They were husband and wife for decades, and it makes people heart cold.Lian Li\u2019s word was just a thoughtless threat. Now he carelessly said it; it\u2019s too late to take it back even if he wants to. Inside he became even more anxious and angry. He got a stomach full of resentment that he wish to vented at Mrs. Qiao: if she didn\u2019t make a scene, how would matters end up like this?Hearing that she want to find their son to complain, Lian Li was so furious that he nearly passed out: She doesn\u2019t have her son\u2019s future in mind!?In a sorry state, Lian Li stood there, fiercely glared at her, face completely red and the nose was taking a deep breath: This crazy woman is out of control! She attacked without restraint!Immediately some women were coming forward to lift Mrs. Qiao up; all kindly coaxed her. There were also others prompt Lian Li.Third Aunt saw the couple fighting, and she was overjoyed. She then went over to Mrs. Qiao and choked down on a sob: \u201cSister-in-law, quickly stand up! The ground is cold; it\u2019ll be bad if you got sick! It\u2019s probably a joke when Elder brother talks about divorce. Sister-in-law, no need to be afraid!\u201dShe also sighed: \u201cIt\u2019s all because of me! It\u2019s all my fault! If it weren\u2019t because of me, Elder Brother wouldn\u2019t say this kind of word! Sister-in-law wouldn\u2019t be like this! Oh, let\u2019s leave it! One phrase Elder Brother said is right, a family in harmony will prosper!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cYour family\u2019s Third Aunt is right!\u201dEveryone seeing how understanding and reasonable Third Aunt was, all nodded and sighed.Only, just Mrs. Qiao saw Third Aunt\u2019s corner of mouth flashed into a smirk very quickly and hearing her say these words, the hint of ridicule thicken.She was immediately livid mad. With a whoosh, she suddenly stood up from the ground and pointed at Third Aunt and screamed: \u201cYou wretch, when did you get to have a say in my family matters!\u201d\u201cShut your mouth for me!\u201d When Third Aunt spoke like that, Lian Li was relieved and want to say a few right words to let the matter pass. However, he never thought that before he could release a sigh of relief, Mrs. Qiao was causing trouble again.Lian Li flared up, and it was worse than before. He went up with raise hand and smack Mrs. Qiao with two loud slaps. Pa! Pa! And admonish her: \u201cHave you lost mind!? What nonsense are you speaking!\u201dAfter Mrs. Qiao screamed, those women, who came forward to lift her up and coax her, frowned. They silently shift back. This kind of person, who would be willing to stand by her side?When Lian Li gave the two slaps, he gave a forceful wink. Finally, Mrs. Qiao saw it.Stocked still for a second before Mrs. Qiao recovers her wits. She immediately understood what was happening and couldn\u2019t help feel regretful now. And then she hated Third Aunt even more.At this time she no longer fought with Lian Li but the flame of anger and unhappiness inside didn\u2019t extinguish at all.It\u2019s because she couldn\u2019t explode at Lian Li who have hit her, this made her even more upset.Four crisp slaps! Not one bit of pretending! At this moment her two cheeks were hurt like needles pricked it.Mrs. Qiao hated Third Aunt with all her soul. She stood there with head lowered and gritted teeth. She didn\u2019t move at all.\u201cIf you dare say any more nonsense, I will not let you off!\u201d Lian Li sternly berate Mrs. Qiao with few sentences and also turned to Third Aunt. With an apologetic smile, he said: \u201cXiao Man ah, I\u2019m sorry. Your Sister-in-law is frank and outspoken. She handles matters crudely and doesn\u2019t use brain, so don\u2019t take offense! How about come live with us, take it as us compensating you\u2026\u201dLian Li was looking at Third Aunt with a face full of sincerity and expectant. Seeing this, Third Aunt felt her hair stood on end and got chill all over her body.She subconsciously took a few steps back, and in a warm tone, she sighed: \u201d Since Elder Brother said it like this, what else can I say? The sky is about to darkened, Elder Brother and Sister-in-law should return. I\u2019m living comfortably at Fang Zhou\u2019s home, so no need to trouble Elder Brother and Sister-in-law.\u201dThird Aunt said it politely and turned toward everyone and gave her thanks and left.Everyone saw that she left, they also scattered.Lian Li lightly breathed ou. He knew that Third Aunt wouldn\u2019t live at his place and just by looking at her face these days, you can see that she isn\u2019t living too bad. She likes to take advantage, so could she bear to leave?\u201cLet\u2019s return too!\u201d Lian Li glare at Mrs. Qiao and heavily harrumphed.Mrs. Qiao\u2019s face was swollen red and searing with pain. She vehemently spat at the ground and turned around to enter the yard.\u201cIt\u2019s because you meddle too much! For no reason, why provoke her? She\u2019s living her life, how does it bother you!?\u201dOnce enter the yard, Lian Li dropped his expression and berated Mrs. Qiao.Mrs. Qiao halted then cried with injustice: \u201cWhen did I provoke her? I wish for her not to cross our house door path when walking around from now on. I can\u2019t hide from her enough, so why would I provoke her?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d Lian Li was surprised, then continued. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t provoke her, then why did she come over and make a scene?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And this causes her (3rd Aunt) to run over to sob and fuss at their door.Mrs. Qiao is this kind of character.But he knows very well, right at this moment Mrs. Qiao\u2019s expression isn\u2019t like she is fibbing. And also there\u2019s no need for her to lie to his face.So that means she is telling the truth.Both of them were in a trance for a moment.Mrs. Qiao stiffly spoke: \u201cShe came to our home entrance to cause a ruckus out of nowhere, while we had to accompany her, no?\u201d\u201cThis wretch!\u201d Mrs. Qiao suffocated from anger, head feeling dizzy.Lian Li was also muted by anger, on the inside he was extremely miserable: after half day of ruckus, the person being unreasonable is Lian Xiao Man! And the couple themselves don\u2019t even know why she came to make a scene at all! How can they not feel miserable?\u201cThat little wretch! Does she even put you her elder brother in her eye, or me her Sister-in-law? I\u2019ll find her! I have to ask her why she came to our home and caused trouble out of the blue!\u201d Blinded by anger Mrs. Qiao, wanted to rush out.\u201cCome back here!\u201d Lian Li roughly caught her and coldly commented: \u201cHaven\u2019t you had enough of creating a scene?\u201d\u201cBut how can I leave it like this?\u201d Mrs. Qiao sharply cried out. She blamed the four slaps on her face on Third Aunt\u2019s shoulder.Leave it be? Definitely not.Let\u2019s not say, Mrs. Qiao, even Lian Li isn\u2019t willing too.\u201cFuture days are long!\u201d Lian Li spat out the four words through the gap of his teeth, then took large steps into the house.Mrs. Qiao doesn\u2019t care about what future days are long; she only wants to go over now and make a scene. Return Third Aunt a few hard slaps.But they have suffered a lot today, so not only is their whole body without energy, even their brain feel very chaotic. In addition to that, the second branch got that wretched lass, Lian Fang Zhou. So if she goes now, she\u2019ll definitely won\u2019t gain any benefit. All she could do was vilify a few words quietly and temporarily hold her anger and follow her husband inside.The couple was angered so much by Third Aunt that their head was feeling faint. They ultimately didn\u2019t realize the oddness of their own house being light up\u2013 no one home so how could they bare to light the candle?After they enter the house, both of them lift their head and unexpectedly saw a Lian Fang Zhou with a cold face sitting in at the top middle. She had frightened them.\u201cYou\u2026 why are you here!?\u201d Mrs. Qiao questioned.Lian Fang Zhou coldly laughed and suddenly stood up and picked up a teapot and fiercely flung at the floor. With a bang, it shattered to pieces.As Mrs. Qiao gasped in shock, she continued to smash four cups one at a time. All turned to shattered pieces.\u201cI had it with you!\u201d Mrs. Qiao saw that in a blink of an eye Lian Fang Zhou had smashed her teapot and four cups into smithereens, her heart tightly twist in pain. She screamed and jumped to strike Lian Fang Zhou.It\u2019s just that her eyes were so focused on Lian Fang Zhou, that she overlooked Ah Jian who was at her side.Naturally, Ah Jian immediately stood in front of Lian Fang Zhou. With just a light lift of his hand, he swatted Mrs. Qiao away like a fly. She staggered backward. After stumbling for few steps, she became stable again.Only then did she notice Ah Jian. She gave him a vicious glare. When she met with Ah Jian\u2019s ever so calm gaze, her whole became as stiff as a board. She stood there, not daring to move a step.\u201cLian Fang Zhou! You shameless girl! Not only did you raise an adulterer at home, you even brought the adulterer to hit your elders!\u201d Mrs. Qiao redirected her glare at Lian Fang Zhou and viciously screeched.Not a single hint of anger was on Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s face. Instead, she didn\u2019t lose one bit of her composure at all. She lightly smiled, and in an icy tone, she said: \u201cSeems like Third Aunt\u2019s ruckus isn\u2019t enough. Tomorrow we need to go to the County town and have a good talk with cousin\u2019s Academy.\u201dStartled, Mrs. Qiao swept her over her and Ah Jian. And then she raised her lips to a sneer: \u201cAlright! Go on, talk then! I think it\u2019s better to talk about your matter first!\u201dMrs. Qiao pointed at Ah Jian and smirked: \u201cLet\u2019s talk about you lacking in woman\u2019s propriety first. To let an adulterer live at home!\u201dWhen she finished, Mrs. Qiao gave her a smug look, as if she caught Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s weak spot. Her heart immediately cried out in delight.Not just her, Lian Li was also slightly smirking at the side: This time his woman has become astute.Lian Fang Zhou paused for a bit and started to laugh mockingly. She steadily gazed at Mrs. Qiao and questioned: \u201cLacking in woman\u2019s virtue? Adulterer? I haven\u2019t married yet, so what woman\u2019s virtue? I have no husband, so what adulterer? Ah Jian is our family\u2019s farmhand. We have an indenture as proof. If you speak any more rubbish, we\u2019ll make a trip a trip to the county town!\u201dShe coldly laughed and raised her brow and continued: \u201cAh Jian and I aren\u2019t married. If I marry him for real, then what? Who would say anything?\u201dMrs. Qiao and Lian Li became tongue-tied. They were completely dumbfounded.What Lian Fang Zhou said was right!Hearing Lian Fang Zhou say this so brazenly, Ah Jian\u2019s heart slightly jumped. Out of nowhere, an inexplicable feeling sprouted. He couldn\u2019t help steal some quick glance at her. Inside he felt a bit happy.However, Mrs. Qiao and Lian Li were furious. They didn\u2019t have the slightest clue what to do with her.In the ordinary course of events, Mrs. Qiao and Lian Li should take their field as well as taking care of the four siblings after their parents passed away. Afterall, they were the only elders in Lian Family.But Mrs. Qiao and Lian Li were a bit unwilling when they thought about the fact they would need to prepare dowry for their two nieces and help two nephews find a bride.Even so, the second branch\u2019s few acres of land is very tempting. So they have their plans. They felt that those fours kids have fully grown up yet, what could they understand? After few years, they could use some trick and take over all of those lands. And also don\u2019t have to take care of them. Isn\u2019t that great?So when the Village Junior Officer Zhang made an appearance to request them to take in and care for Lian Fang Zhou and the others as their uncle and aunt, they rejected no matter what. Firmly stating that the first branch and second branch has already separated, so the second branch got nothing to do with them. And also that even though their brother and sister-in-law is gone, they still have the house and field. Lian Fang Zhou is 15, and Lian Ze is 12. They aren\u2019t kids anymore. So why would they take them in? And they have to fund their son\u2019s study. They indeed don\u2019t the energy to do more\u2026This matter brewed for few days. No matter what Officer Zhang said, they were still not willing. In the end, Officer Zhang let it go.Everyone in the village knows about this matter.So if Mrs. Qiao and Lian Li want to take control of Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s marriage, it wouldn\u2019t be possible.Third Aunt? She has already married off, so she can\u2019t intervene with her maternal family\u2019s matter.So it\u2019s entirely possible for Lian Fang Zhou to choose her husband. She couldn\u2019t possibly let her young brother help her decide, right?Lian Fang Zhou coldly glanced at the couple with disdainful, mocking gaze. She coldly said: \u201cAh Jian, let\u2019s go! We\u2019ll go to the County town tomorrow with Third Aunt!\u201dLian Fang Zhou raised her foot to leave. Ah Jian briefly looked at them and then followed Lian Fang Zhou.\u201cFang Zhou! My niece!\u201d Lian Li distressingly thought he mustn\u2019t let Lian Fang Zhou make trouble at the County Academy and ruin his son\u2019s reputation.Lian Fang Zhou dare to risk going, but he couldn\u2019t.Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t bother with him. Her footsteps didn\u2019t halt at all; she kept on steadily walk away.\u201cNIECE! NIECE!\u201d Lian Li became frantic. He hurried over and reached out to grab Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s arm.But before he could touch Lian Fang Zhou, Ah Jian raised his hand at the right time and blocked his outstretched hand.Ah Jian\u2019s movement seems very natural and very relaxed as if it didn\u2019t contain any strength. However, Lian Li, like Mrs. Qiao earlier, felt as if a powerful force ram over. He couldn\u2019t help stagger few steps away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If they leave now, then it would be hard to reverse the situation.Lian Li became desperate, he couldn\u2019t bother with it anymore and scurried over. \u201cNiece, I\u2019m completely at fault! Please be merciful and let us off! Whatever condition you have, say it!\u201dLian Fang Zhou was waiting for him to say this. Once spoken, she paused and halted her footsteps. Ah Jian also stopped and leisurely stood by her side.\u201cHusband, what are you saying! Have you become muddle-headed!\u201d Hearing Lian Li say this, Mrs. Qiao felt exasperated and immediately screeched.Lian Fang Zhou gave a cold chuckle and moved her feet to leave.\u201cSHUT YOUR MOUTH!\u201d Lian Li angrily roared as he glared at Mrs. Qiao. He then hurried forward to stop Lian Fang Zhou. He wanted to reach out to grab but glanced at Ah Jian by her side. He reached out his other hand and clasped his hands together. \u201cFang Zhou, my niece! You can\u2019t leave. You can\u2019t leave! If your cousin gains honor and rank, you\u2019ll also receive some benefits too. In future, who would dare bully you and your siblings? Isn\u2019t that right? You can\u2019t harm him in a fit of rage!\u201dLian Fang Zhou looked at Mrs. Qiao briefly and then indifferently spoke to Lian Li. \u201cThe words that Uncle says, I don\u2019t deserve it. Hehe, I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have the fortune to wait for that day. I\u2019ll be set up by someone before that!\u201d\u201cHow could that be! Who would do this kind of- matter for no reason!\u201d Lian Li felt a bit guilty inside. He changed \u2018wicked matter\u2019 to \u2018matter\u2019 when he spoke out.He understood why Lian Fang Zhou came.\u201cThat\u2019s hard to say! There\u2019s all kind of people in the world! Some people are born to love creating malicious rumors and can\u2019t stand other being well off! Just like Hua Family\u2019s daughter-in-law. If I don\u2019t teach her a lesson, she won\u2019t know how stinky her mouth is!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou casually pointed out.Lian Li mentally rained down curses on Mrs. Qiao\u2019s head. So what if others want to raise a wild man or have a secret affair. What has it to do with you? Why pry when there\u2019s nothing to do! Now your stinky mouth stirred up trouble.After he finished cursing Mrs. Qiao, he was secretly shocked by Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s scheme. If Lian Fang Zhou came over to fight over this matter and she\u2019ll lose if she spoke out! It\u2019s a fact that her household took in a stranger. So what Third Aunt lives there and even if nothing happened at all, once suspicion contaminated her, there\u2019s no way to plead innocence, since the more they explain, the worse it gets.However, she didn\u2019t even mention a single word. Instead, she sent over Third Aunt to create a ruckus for some inexplicable reason. He was already sure that Third Aunt \u2018s ruckus was Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s idea to agitate his wife to lose control. This way she grasps their weakness and forces him with no choice but to lower his head to her.Lian Li felt chills crept over his back:so formidable at such a young age. What would it be like in few years time?Forget about them wanting to scheme for their land. They\u2019d be lucky if they weren\u2019t harmed by her!For that reason, his son\u2019s future is more important! Cause if his son became an official, what does he have to afraid of?Immediately Lian Li\u2019s face blacken. He twisted his head and bellowed at Mrs. Qiao: \u201cStill not coming over!\u201dBeing yelled at by her husband in front of Lain Fang Zhou, Mrs. Qiao felt humiliated. She harrumphed and grudgingly answered. \u201cGo over to do what!\u201dHearing her still not knowing her wrong and still dare to talk back, Lian Li became even more furious and his face blacken even more. He bellowed even louder. \u201cGET OVER HERE!\u201dCaught off-guard, Mrs. Qiao was startled. Seeing that his face was pitch black and brimming with rage that was about to erupt, she dare not retort. Livid, she slowly walked over.Lian Li felt pained seeing this. So when she was few steps away, he immediately grabbed him and forcibly pulled her over. He spun her to place her in front of Lian Fang Zhou and coldly ordered. \u201cWhat good thing you did, so apologize to Niece!\u201dMrs. Qiao stared at Lian Li with widened eyes:let her apologize?\u201cHurry up!\u201d Lian Li gave her an icy glare. He voiced in a low tone through his gritted teeth. \u201cYou want to ruin your son?\u201dMrs. Qiao was very unwilling. She doesn\u2019t believe that Lian Fang Zhou and Third Aunt would go the County Academy. What kind of place is that place? They say they\u2019ll go; then they can go?But at this moment, Lian Li\u2019s whole body was pulsing with a tyrannical vibe. It left no room for her to refute. So, she quietly stuttered. \u201cWhat, what wrong have I done that I need to apologize for?\u201d\u201cQuickly apologize! Stop being a windbag!\u201d Lian Li shouted. \u201cWhat your stinky mouth said, do we still need to ask?\u201dMrs. Qiao froze and then immediately understand that Third Aunt\u2019s ruckus was to do with this.She became mad and even more unwilling. She slanted her eyes to Ah Jian and was about to speak. Coincidentally, she met with Ah Jian\u2019s calm and steady gaze. For no reason, she came to a stop and dared not speak out.\u201cIt seems like tomorrow we\u2019ll have to go to the county town!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou coldly voiced out.Just as Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s word came to a stop, Lian Li suddenly pushed Mrs. Qiao to her front. He coldly pressurized her. \u201cGet out off here, if you don\u2019t apologize now!\u201dDid he team up with an outsider to bully her? And also want to kick her out?Mrs. Qiao nearly exploded in a fury. But she could hear that Lian Li wasn\u2019t joking with her.Mrs. Qiao kept on enduring with all her might. She turned to Lian Fang Zhou. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201dLian Fang Zhou coldly stared at her, \u201cIn future, if I hear any malicious rumors or gossip, I won\u2019t care about whether you\u2019re an elder or not!\u201dMrs. Qiao shot dagger at her before immediately lowering her eyes. On the inside she thought:you wretched lass, when did you every respected your elders? You didn\u2019t give one penny of the ten liang to your elder as filial piety.\u201cThere won\u2019t be any!\u201d Lian Li immediately followed up. \u201cNone at all!\u201dLian Fang Zhou gave an unimpressed smile. \u201cReally? Then shouldn\u2019t Aunt give me a pledge? I\u2019m still a bit worried.\u201dLian Li turned his head to Mrs. Qiao. \u201cWell, hurry! Make a vow!\u201dMrs. Qiao couldn\u2019t stand her husband\u2019s glare, so she disgruntledly promised. \u201cI, I swear that from now on I won\u2019t!\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t what?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t create malicious rumors!\u201dLian Fan Zhou remained silent. She just stared at her.\u201cAre you stupid or what? Speak more clearly!\u201d Lian Li pushed her again.Seeing that her husband continuously put her to shame in front of other people, Mrs. Qiao was livid and mentally stressed. A burst of anger burst out, and she immediately yelled: \u201cI, Mrs. Qiao swear that from now on if I ever create malicious rumors or gossip to frame my niece wrongly, I will be struck to death by lightning!\u201dLian Li did not expect her to yell, so it made him jump.Lian Fang Zhou and Ah Jian weren\u2019t startled. Instead, Lian Fang Zhou chuckled and swept a glance at her. \u201cYou better remember what you said today, Aunt. The Heaven won\u2019t be deceived. It\u2019s listening, and it remembers! Ah Jian, let\u2019s go!\u201d \u201dShe doesn\u2019t want to stay here any longer.In a fit of anger, Mrs. Qiao made a ruthless vow. Initially, she thought Lian Fang Zhou would say some polite words. But instead, of gracious words, it was a loud wake-up call. At once, her temper flared up, and she stamped her feet. \u201cStop right there!\u201dSurprisingly, Lian Fang Zhou did stop. She turned around and indifferently asked, \u201cAnything else?\u201dMrs. Qiao reached ou her palm to her and with a sunken face, she demanded, \u201cYou smashed our teapot and cups and wanted to leave like this? Compensate us with two liang now!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You can buy several sets of those teapots and cup. Unbelievable, she actually dared to say it. What an idiot!Lian Fang Zhou had a \u2018have you become stupid?\u2019 look. And snorted, \u201cI\u2019m warning you, the next time you dare to spread malicious rumors, I won\u2019t be smashing teapots and cups! Believe it or not, I\u2019ll beat you up with all I got.\u201dWith a blink, Lain Fang Zhou\u2019s eyes deepened. Any retort from Mrs. Qiao was choked back by her gaze. She could only blankly watch Lian Fang Zhou and Ah Jian leave.Only when their figure disappeared from her sight, did Mrs. Qiao regain her breath. She then spat out, \u201cYou\u2019re just bluffing! As if anyone is afraid of you!\u201dBefore she finished speaking, her face received another slap from Lian Li. Enraged, Lian Li shouted, \u201cWill you stop it! You only know how to cause unnecessary trouble!\u201dMrs. Qiao started screeching again. Initially, her cheeks were already stinging. Now, this slap made her head spin from the pain. Immediately she was also annoyed. In addition to Lian Li\u2019s scolding, she felt infuriated. With a roar, she jumped on Lian Li; she wailed, cursed and hit him.Flustered and exasperated, Lian Li dodged and retaliated as he bellowed, \u2018STOP.\u2019 But why would Mrs. Qiao listen? So the two of them got into a scuffle.After Lian Fang Zhou and Ah Jian left Lian\u2019s first branch, Lian Fang Zhou lightly sighed out in relief. Hopefully that gossiper, Mrs. Qiao learned her lesson. Or else, she won\u2019t let her off next time! Although she doesn\u2019t care about the rumors, it didn\u2019t mean she liked to be harmed by someone out of nowhere.Under the faint moonlight, the two of them didn\u2019t speak. They just moved with light steps.She tilted her head to peek at Ah Jian. Suddenly she felt a bit troubled. She coughed and gently spoke out. \u201cAbout that\u2026 Ah Jian, I was hasty. So what I just said, don\u2019t take it to heart\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Ah Jian questioned. \u201cWhat words?\u201dAfter saying this, the phrase about she and him being unmarried popped up in his mind. His face immediately reddened slightly and had no courage to look at her. Luckily the moonlight was very weak, so she didn\u2019t see any change in him.However, Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t remember those words. Feeling uncomfortable, she replied, \u201cAbout\u2013 indenture!\u201dAfraid that he would misunderstand her, Lian Fang Zhou rushed to continued. \u201cI just said those words to anger them two. You have helped us a lot. We\u2019ll remember that at heart!\u201dThese few days, Ah Jian accompanied them to the mountains to gather mushrooms. He\u2019s very quick-witted, or more likely he has a talent in this area. He became familiar with Mount Xian Teng\u2019s terrain and surrounding faster than the Lian siblings.With him leading, they would have a fruitful return every day.He also recognizes a vast amount of medicinal herbs. That day Lian Fang Zhou plucked some bupleurum tenue and said that she wants to save it to treat cold and fever. He then happened to find a variety of other herbs and explained each one to her; handles stomachache, headache, dispel poison, stop bleeding, knife wounds, burns, and others. Just from a casual talk, you can tell how skilled he is.Even though he doesn\u2019t remember when he learned it, but he knows. And also when he said it, instinctively nobody would doubt him.Not just Lian Fang Zhou, even Lian Ze, Mrs. Zhao and Li Juan admire him greatly. Lian Ze became even more close to him like a diehard follower.Without anyone noticing, he already has already become part of this family.So it was that!Ah Jian couldn\u2019t help become disappointed. But he immediately cast aside that feeling and grinned. \u201cI know. I\u2019m not bothered by it all!\u201dFrom his tone, Lian Fang Zhou knew he didn\u2019t take it to heart. She broke out into a grin. \u201cThat\u2019s great. I can be at ease then.\u201dAh Jian nodded and turned to look at her thoughtfully. He asked, \u201cThey always bully you and your siblings, right?\u201dLian Fang Zhou sighed. With a sense of mockery and helplessness, she murmured, \u201cMade you see a joke! Those are my blood-related uncle and aunt!\u201dContemplating for a second before Ah Jian comforted her. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to feel sad. That kind of people exists but not often seen. It\u2019s not worth being depressed over that kind of people.\u201dLian Fang Zhou made a sound of agreement. \u201cI won\u2019t be depressed over them. It\u2019s not going to be easy for them to bully me!\u201dThinking of her actions tonight, Ah Jian grinned. All of a sudden he seriously asked her: \u201cMiss Lian, don\u2019t chase me out alright? Next time you want to settle matters with them, I\u2019ll come with you!\u201dLian Fang Zhou froze. Naturally what he meant was supporting her when he said he\u2019ll accompany her. Her heart felt warm and chuckled. After giving it some thoughts, she sincerely nodded. \u201cYes, what you say is reasonable! Next time I come without your support, it won\u2019t do.\u201d\u201cSo, so you won\u2019t chase me out?\u201d Ah Jian was surprised as well as delighted. His eyes lit up.Slightly embarrassed, Lian Fang Zhou dare not meet his gaze. She quietly responded: \u201cActually, since you came to my home, you have helped us a lot. Really! If you don\u2019t hate it, then stay!\u201d\u201cOf course I don\u2019t hate it.\u201d Ah Jian became elated and beamed with joy. His heart finally settled down and relaxed.Lian Fang Zhou also smiled. Then in a flash, she recalled something and mentally sighed. She thought, \u2018if one day you regain your memory, would you still stay here?\u2019Definitely won\u2019t! The things you know isn\u2019t something an ordinary man would understand. So where are you really from? What kind of identity?In short, definitely won\u2019t be ordinary at all!I don\u2019t know if letting you stay is a right choice or not\u2026Although Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t say it out loud, her expression subconsciously reveals a bit. Ah Jian acutely detected it and blanked out before dejectedly asked. \u201cAm\u2026 I putting you in a spot?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou came back to her sense. Stupefied, she asked. \u201cWhy would I be in a spot?\u201dShe couldn\u2019t help look at Ah Jian in puzzlement.A moment ago he was on top of the world. But in a blink of an eye, his mood drop down?Ah Jian looked like he had something to say but stopped for some reason. In the end, he asked. \u201cIs letting me stay\u2026 causing difficulties?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s mind came to a halt. It took her a while to realize that he misunderstood. She quickly denied with a laugh. \u201cNot at all! How could it be!\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Ah Jian responded, but he still doesn\u2019t believe it.His expression made Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s heart softened as if she has don\u2019t something to hurt him. She also found it funny that she would have this kind of feeling. She continued. \u201cReally, no difficulties! Just now I was thinking of another matter!\u201dFine. Since we already encountered each other, it counts as fate. Then in future, let\u2019s meet and depart on a good note!Thinking like this, Lian Fang Zhou found the weight in her heart lightened.\u201cSo it\u2019s like this!\u201d Ah Jian grinned again and sheepishly said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have wildly guessed!\u201dLian Fang Zhou sook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing at all. Not something you have to apologize for.\u201dThe two of them had already reached the entrance when they grinned at each other.Before they entered the house, the two of them saw Third Aunt pacing around the house like ants in a hot pot. They also heard Lian Fang Qing clear voice comment. \u201cThird Aunt quickly sit down. You flashing to here and there is making me dizzy.\u201d\u201cShoo, you\u2019re just a kid, what would you understand! Go over to one side!\u201d Third Aunt halted her steps and indignantly spoke. Then with a lift of her head, she saw Lian Fang Zhou and Ah Jian. She rushed over and anxiously questioned. \u201cHow was it? How did it go?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just by looking at their tidy clothes and not a single hair out of place, you\u2019ll know it went smoothly.Lian Fang Zhou laughed. \u201cNo problem at all! Let\u2019s eat now! After tormenting so long, I\u2019m starving!\u201d\u201cAlright! Let\u2019s eat first!\u201d Right now, Third Aunt was at ease. Then her heart couldn\u2019t help start itching. She wanted to know how Lian Fang Zhou took care that old witch, Mrs. Qiao.However, she knew now wasn\u2019t the time to talk about this because Lian Fang Zhou won\u2019t speak of this matter in front of the two little ones. It could only wait until after dinner.At this time, the sky has already darkened. Not just Lian Fang Zhou, even the whole family was hungry. Hearing Lian Fang Zhou said that it was okay, they all sat down and happily ate their dinner. Only Third Aunt was itching with curiosity. She can\u2019t wait to hear about unfortunate Mrs. Qiao.Lian Fang Zhou saw it. She mentally laughed and kept on pretending she didn\u2019t know.After dinner, Third Aunt couldn\u2019t hold it anymore. \u201cFang Zhou, did Mrs. Qiao make it difficult for you?\u201dLian Fang Zhou looked up and saw Third Aunt\u2019s shining eyes stared at her unblinkingly.Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t follow her direction of the conversation and just smiled. \u201cShe didn\u2019t. How could it be easy for her to bully me? I need to discuss something with Ah Jian. So, Third Aunt, we\u2019ll talk about it in detail next time.\u201dThird Aunt had no way to stop her, so she could only hold back her curiosity. \u201cOk!\u201dHearing Lian Fang Zhou was looking for him, Ah Jian has already tagged behind her.Lian Fang Zhou spoke to him for a while at the entrance. At first, Ah Jian was stunned, but afterward, he kept on nodding his head in agreement. Immediately Lian Fang became reassured and told him. \u201cYou go inside first. I\u2019m going to make a trip to Aunt Zhang\u2019s for some matters.\u201dAh Jian didn\u2019t speak anymore. He nodded and entered inside.Third Aunt didn\u2019t dare to interrupt Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s conversation with Ah Jian. So when she heard movement, she lifted her head only to see Ah Jian coming in and rushed forward to ask, \u201cWhere Fang Zhou?\u201dHow could Ah Jian understand Third Aunt\u2019s anxious for gossip mind? He just felt that her anxiety was a little odd. He answered, \u201cShe said she has something to do at Aunt Zhang\u2019s.\u201d\u201cWhat!?\u201d Instantly, Third Aunt became dejected and started to mutter quietly. \u201cGoing over their house every few days, what is she doing?\u201dOf course, Lian Fang Zhou wasn\u2019t going over there to play. She had some matters that she needs to discuss with them.It was already in the middle of October so that it couldn\u2019t count as cold. But deep in the mountain, the temperature was even lower. So basically, there\u2019s no mushroom to pick.Lian Fang Zhou had no plans to sell the mushrooms they just collected over the last few days. She wanted to wait until November-December. As at that time the price would be higher.Since it\u2019s a dry good, it\u2019ll be light, easy to store and won\u2019t go off.So, she\u2019ll need to do other stuff earlier.Aunt Zhang\u2019s family would warmly welcome Lian Fang Zhou anytime she comes. So when she arrived, Aunt Zhang, Uncle Li, and Mrs. Zhao enthusiastically called her to sit. Wholly filled with intimacy and affectionate.Mrs. Zhao\u2019s eyes flashed when she saw Lian Fang Zhou and quickly asked, \u201d Are we going to the town tomorrow to sell the mushrooms? I have everything prepared.\u201dMrs. was already itching to sell the mushrooms right away. She was looking forward to the feeling of counting money for a long time now. Just the thought of the few sacks of mushrooms turning to chunky coins, makes her heart would fly with joy.\u201cSao-zi, no need to be hasty. Wait a little longer! Today I came for a different matter!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou responded.Then Aunt Zhang criticized her daughter-in-law. \u201cYou\u2019re such an impatient brat! Didn\u2019t we already agree on waiting til November-December to sell them? And you still ask?\u201d\u201cI saw Fang Zhou came over and thought there was a change in plan!\u201d Mrs. Zhao laughed it off.Lian Fang Zhou then revealed, \u201cAlthough it isn\u2019t about mushrooms, I want to talk about another matter that could earn money. Just that I don\u2019t know if Uncle and Aunt are willing to do it together.\u201dHearing Lian Fang Zhou say it like this, Uncle Li exchange glance with his wife. \u201cOh? If you have anything to say, voice it out, Fang Zhou!\u201dUncle Li knew it wasn\u2019t a matter as simple as collecting mushrooms when he heard it.Lian Fang Zhou then brought it out into the open. \u201cIt\u2019ll soon be winter, so I thought if we make some charcoal, then we\u2019ll have a limitless market! I\u2013\u201d\u201cWHAT!?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou had yet to finish when the Li father and son cried out in shock at the same time. Aunt Zhang and Mrs. Zhao were also stunned.\u201cWhat are you saying? Making Charcoal?\u201d Uncle Li couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u201d The whole family\u2019s reaction made Lian Fang Zhou scared. So when she nodded, she felt a bit\u2026 guilt-ridden?\u201cFang Zhou ah,\u201d Uncle Li burst out laughing. \u201cMaking charcoal is labor that requires technique. Not everyone can do it! Within this ten mile radius, not many families can do. Those who can are passed down from generation to generation to earn a living. None of them would teach other!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. In our village, no one can do it! If they know, then with one winter they can earn nearly one year of expense. They would have already been worry-free!\u201d Li San Ge also laughed.The Li Family treated Lian Fang Zhou as a little kid suddenly thinking of a strange idea and doesn\u2019t know the in-depth difficulties. So she could say it so lightly. They laughed as they explained it to her.Mrs. Zhao lightly sighed out and felt disappointed. She thought Lian Fang Zhou had some good idea to earn money.Li Juan cast a glance at her sister-in-law and secretly curled her lips.However, they really did underestimate Lian Fang Zhou.In her previous life, Lian Fang Zhou often went to the farming village because of work reason. She has seen the process of making charcoal before, and at that time she was curious and purposely went over to help. She had intensely questioned the fellow villager.In the modern time, heating technologies are plentiful in winter. And there\u2019s also factory-made charcoal sold. So the villager\u2019s traditional way of earth kiln\u2019s charcoal is troublesome, as it wastes energy, time and resources. It\u2019s an old method that can\u2019t keep up with time, so not many people would make charcoal.So that\u2019s why filled with curiosity, Lian Fang Zhou ask about it with the fellow villager. Instead of keeping it a secret, the fellow villager felt proud of teaching a city person something they don\u2019t understand. He kept on explaining to her nonstop, including a lot of problems that need to be watched out for.She was a bright and quick mind person with a good memory. Who could have known that she could use the knowledge now.And because of that day\u2019s conversation, allowed her to know this age\u2019s high-end technique labor. But at this age, not just anyone can do it, especially women. Without any exception a young girl like her.So that\u2019s why even if she had the idea of making charcoal, she had no way to explain it to other. And also, doing this task can\u2019t rely on just her and Lian Ze. It\u2019s strenuous work.Today, she finally got an inspiration and thought of a good idea. And that was Ah Jian. She can\u2019t know it but Ah Jian could.That\u2019s why just now she had talked it through with Ah Jian. She had pushed this matter onto Ah Jian\u2019s shoulder. So when the time comes, she can let Ah Jian listen to her explanation and then let him repeat it them to hear. With her advising at the side, Ah Jian couldn\u2019t possibly do anything wrong.In an instant, Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s heart became free from anxiety. It was right to let Ah Jian stay. This way in future she could use Ah Jian as an excuse whenever she wanted to do something.As to why she trust Ah Jian that much, Lian Fang Zhou never gave it any thoughts.\u201cUncle and Aunt, I understand what you said. However, I wasn\u2019t joking. I\u2019m serious!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou declared. \u201cNaturally I don\u2019t know how. It\u2019s Ah Jian who does!\u201d\u201cAh Jian?\u201d Everyone froze at the same time. They half believed her.They don\u2019t know that about Ah Jian\u2019s amnesiac. Even if they know, it\u2019s nothing. Being amnesiac doesn\u2019t mean he has no memory at all. Ah Jian remembering or subconsciously understand something was possible.\u201cYes! Ah Jian!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou clearly stated and nodded with a bright smile.\u201cYou\u2026 Are you telling the truth? Aiya, that\u2019s wonderful! What are we waiting for, let\u2019s go make charcoal!\u201d Her parent-in-law had yet to recover when Mrs. Zhao excitedly cried out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Uncle Li said, \u201cWhat you\u2019re saying\u2026 is the truth? Ah Jian could do it?Lian Fang Zhou grinned. \u201cUncle, let\u2019s give a try, and we\u2019ll know then, right? Making charcoal take around 7-8 days!\u201d\u201cI believe Fang Zhou isn\u2019t lying. So, give it a try!\u201d Aunt Zhang followed up.The Li father and son looked at each other and nodded. \u201cAlright! Let\u2019s give it a try! When the time comes, let Ah Jian tell us what we need to do. No need to act polite!\u201d\u201cRather than pushing the matter to later, we\u2019ll go to the mountain tomorrow then!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou nodded in delight. She already found the perfect spot.Uncle Li agreed. \u201cIf we can make it, then your family take the larger portion of the profit. We\u2019ll take the smaller part.\u201dAunt Zhang hurriedly agreed. \u201cThat\u2019s right! Fang Zhou ah, you also need to urge Ah Jian not to tell other!\u201dLian Fang Zhou promised, \u201cAunt Zhang, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not that muddle-headed. When the time comes, we\u2019ll split it between us in equal half. I\u2019m afraid that most of the heavy work will rely on Uncle Li and Brother San Ge.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s what they\u2019re supposed to do!\u201d Aunt Zhang persisted in declining. Lian Fang Zhou firmly maintain her stance, so she could only agree.Seeing the situation, Mrs. Zhao secretly let out a sigh of relief. She then sent Lian Fang Zhou out with a grin and treated her more intimacy.Mrs. Zhao doesn\u2019t know if the mushrooms could sell for a reasonable price. However, she does know that charcoal will undoubtedly sell for a reasonable price.The next day, the two families entered the mountain together. Altogether it was seven people; Aunt Zhang, Uncle Li, Li San Ge, Mrs. Zhao, Lian Fang Zhou, Lian Ze and Ah Jian. They strapped themselves with chopping timber knife, hoe, shovel and few winnowing baskets.Lian Fang Zhou, Ah Jian, Uncle Li and Li San Ge worked on digging out a kiln. While Aunt Zhang, Mrs. Zhao and Lian Ze were sent to chop timber.Ah Jian explained what kind of wood they can chop. After finishing, he glanced at Lian Fang Zhou, and they secretly exchange expression. Then Ah Jian knew he said it correctly and he let Lian Ze go off.Although wood can become charcoal, the quality depends mostly on what the wood is like, aside from the kiln and the technique used.Must choose those with thick density hardwood like beech, oak, wild cherry tree, wild pear tree and others as the main base, as it is like tea which relies on the base which makes it how pure its essence is.These trees turn into charcoal that burns longer, have no sparks, and less ash are leftover. And this ash doesn\u2019t fly everywhere.If the charcoal were from less dense softwood, it would have sparks crackling and jumping out, and its ash would effortlessly fly everywhere. The burning time would also be half of the hardwood\u2019s charcoal. And some doesn\u2019t even reach half.Under Ah Jian\u2019s explanation and occasional quick pointers from Lian Fang Zhou, the four of them finally dug a mud charcoal kiln with a chimney and fire entrance after one whole day.The charcoal kiln split into top and bottom section. The top one holds the soon-to-be charcoal timber. The bottom is where the fire burn. Some pipes connect the top and bottom part. It needs to burn til a certain degree, and then seal kiln so tightly that no air can pass through. After 3-4 days, dig out the kiln, and the charcoal is done.Hardwood is difficult to chop. With just one day, Aunt Zhang, her daughter-in-law and Lian Ze cut an insignificant amount. Aunt Zhang\u2019s heart aches from the fact that Lian Ze was still little. A few times she insisted that he must rest. It might be because last night her parents-in-law gave a warning to her, Mrs. Zhao did not have any objection.But Lian Ze wasn\u2019t willing. If Aunt Zhang and Mrs. Zhao didn\u2019t take a break, then he resolute about not resting.Seeing that the sun was about to set, they decided to return home.Uncle Li and Li San Ge already believe in Ah Jian now because the kiln they dug out looks about right.Anyway, they never saw it before, so it\u2019s right.The next day, the seven of them went up the mountain to chop timber. This time there are more people, and on top of that, robust men, naturally there\u2019s no comparison with yesterday.From time to time, Aunt Zhang and Uncle Li would call Lian siblings to take a break.Without a doubt, it was strenuous work. Lian Fang Zhou did take several breaks. Lian Ze didn\u2019t rest much; instead, he worked slower than other.Anyhow, Mrs. Zhao wasn\u2019t dissatisfied at all. That\u2019s because Ah Jian\u2019s speed was faster than the Li father and son. It should be said he could match the speed of her family of four. Just watching him, would make you stunned and filled with admiration.Beside admiration, Mrs. Zhao felt extremely envious. She couldn\u2019t help quietly comment her mother-in-law. \u201cFang Zhou and her family are fortunate. It would be wonderful if Ah Jian were part of our family!\u201dAunt Zhang didn\u2019t know whether to cry or laugh. She (Aunt) glared at her (Zhao) and admonished her with smiling eyes. \u201cQuickly work and less thinking about what you have and don\u2019t have!\u201d\u201cOh\u201d Mrs. Zhao breathed out. She knew it wasn\u2019t possible. She was lamenting, that\u2019s all.Suddenly there was a sound of flapping, which startled Mrs. Zhao to cry out. Everyone looked over to see a massive pheasant with a long tail. It was frightened out of its grassy patch and flapped its wings to fly up the mountain on the other side.\u201cHow regrettable! It\u2019ll be great if we could catch!\u201d Mrs. Zhao regained her wits and rued as she watched the flying pheasant.After contemplating a bit, Ah Jian picked up a stone from the ground and threw it straight at the pheasant.Because the pheasant was flying diagonally upward, its body couldn\u2019t go fast. So with Ah Jian\u2019s move, it accurately hit it. The pheasant\u2019s tragic cried out, and it flapped its wings in a panic as it crookedly fell.\u201cOH MY!\u201d Mrs. Zhao joyfully screamed and threw away the timber she chopped and rushed over to where the pheasant crashed.Everyone else was stunned by this scene and blankly looked at Ah Jian.Ah Jian sheepishly laughed.\u201cAmazing. Ah Jian, that was awesome! Even Hunter Sun can\u2019t do one hit!\u201d Uncle Li gave Ah Jian a thumbs up.Li San Ge grinned. \u201cFather, you\u2019re wrong. Let\u2019s not say Hunter Sun; even the best hunter can\u2019t beat Ah Jian! Were you previously a hunter, Ah Jian?\u201d\u201cMade you watch a joke!\u201d Ah Jian just faintly smiled and did not reply to Li San Ge.Was being amnesiac something you could randomly say to anyone? If they heard it, they would believe he\u2019s lying to them.Uncle Li and Li San Ge were tactful people. Seeing that he wasn\u2019t willing to say, naturally, they won\u2019t forcefully make him talk. With a smile, they changed the topic and with great interest, they asked if he would give hunting a try.When Lian Ze saw that Ah Jian have excellent skills, his two eyes nearly shot out stars. He couldn\u2019t resist asking, \u201cBrother Jian! When we were in Mount Xian Teng, we came across lots of pheasant, wild rabbits, and others. Why didn\u2019t you make a move?\u201dAh Jian swept a glance at Lian Fang Zhou and then looked at him. \u201cNone of you ask!\u201d\u201cJust because of this reason!?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou was dumbfounded. She jokingly commented, \u201cOh, how regrettable! We wasted a lot of good opportunities!\u201dAt that time, everyone\u2019s mind was on the mushrooms. Who would pay attention to pheasant and wild rabbit? And also that Ah Jian, he could really anger someone to death!Ah Jian laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. Hmm, pheasant and rabbits, Mount Xian Teng got lots of them. In the next few days, it\u2019s easy to go hunt some!\u201d\u201cAh Jian, you\u2019re so cool! If I could also have such impressive abilities, then it\u2019ll be great.\u201d Lian Ze remarked with envy.Ah Jian responded with a faint smile, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Skills come from practice. If you want to learn, I can teach you.\u201d\u201cReally!?\u201d Surprised and delighted, Lian Ze\u2019s eyes shone like gems. He glanced at Lian Fang Zhou. So excited, he asked Ah Jian with uncertainty. \u201cIs it\u2026 is it true?\u201dBefore he wanted to learn from Hunter Sun, but he firmly remembered what his sister said. So even if he knew Ah Jian was very skilled and he long wished to learn from Ah Jian, he dare not ask.However, when seeing Ah Jian reveal this move today, he was intensely stimulated and spoke out his desire in envy.He never thought that Ah Jian didn\u2019t treat it like a big deal and agree.\u201cOf course,\u201d Ah Jian laughed and swept a glance at Lian Fang Zhou. He continued, \u201cAs long as your sister agree.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now that Ah Jian said it like this and Lian Ze eagerly looked over at her, Lian Fang Zhou smiled as she spoke. \u201cYou want to learn, and Ah Jian is willing to teach, what else can I say? However, learning a martial art isn\u2019t an easy matter. It\u2019ll be very arduous.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not afraid. Thank you, Sister!\u201d Filled with euphoria, Lian Ze thanked Lian Fang Zhou. He turned his head to look at Ah Jian with his sparkling bright eyes, which carried a hint of fawning.Ah Jian laughed at him and nodded. So this matter was settled like that.The three of them chopped at one spot, while Uncle Li and the others were much further away. So Uncle Li and the others didn\u2019t notice what\u2019s happening at their side since they weren\u2019t talking loud. If they looked over now, how odd would they think it is, seeing Lian Ze lost in joy.\u201cSuch a big pheasant, so fat! Aiya, so lucky today!\u201d As she commented, Mrs. Zhao was already back from picking up the pheasant.Ah Jian\u2019s stone broke one of the pheasant\u2019s wings. It took Mrs. Zhao a lot of effort to catch the flopping bird in the grass patch.At this moment, the pheasant in Mrs. Zhao\u2019s hand could only cry out tragically and continue flapping its wings as Mrs. Zhao held it up. She laughed: \u201cIt\u2019s really plump and big. Look at these legs; it\u2019s all meat, really thick! Haha, tonight we got good dishes! Such good luck! Didn\u2019t waste a trip!\u201dEveryone looked over and started joking. That pheasant was enormous, at least three jin (1.5kg). It quite rare for pheasant to grow this big.Aunt Zhang gave her daughter-in-law a criticising stare and lectured: \u201cLook at you, so delighted that you became muddlehead* ((literally: can\u2019t tell where north, west, south, east))! If it weren\u2019t for Ah Jian, how could you catch the pheasant? When we return, don\u2019t forget to give half to Fang Zhou!\u201dImmediately Mrs. Zhao\u2019s heart ached after hearing this. Mother-in-law was right, so she can\u2019t refute. Thinking in another way, treat it as doing them a favor. In the future, when Ah Jian catches pheasant, they might share some with her family.In the end, Mrs. Zhao quickly agreed: \u201cMother-in-law is right. I had the same thought! Fang Zhou ah, you might as well wait for me to cook the pheasant and then bring over a bowl of it. It\u2019ll save some trouble! What do you think?\u201dAlthough Mrs. Zhao said this, in her heart she was already scheming: When the time comes, I have already chopped it into pieces. So even if I give them less, they won\u2019t notice\u2026 Naturally, I can\u2019t give them those meatless claws and wings. It\u2019ll be too obvious!Why Lian Fang Zhou bother quibbling over every detail in these small matters? So she replied, \u201cAlright, then I\u2019ll trouble Saozi!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble at all!\u201d Mrs. Zhao laughed in glee.Seeing that the sun was going to set soon, everyone moved the chopped up wood to the side of the charcoal kiln. After tidying up, they made their way back.On the way back, Lian Ze was very excited. He stuck to Ah Jian\u2019s side as he talked with him. Eyes were completely shining. Seeing this, Lian Fang Zhou secretly laughed and thought, \u2018Don\u2019t know how many days can he persist. It\u2019ll be good if he can really successfully learn a bit.\u2019Once they returned, Third Aunt had already cooked dinner and also boiled some washing water for them.Seeing that they\u2019re back, she said: \u201cYou guys wash up and rest. I\u2019ll cook something, and we can eat! Che-er, come and help me with the fire!\u201dLian Fang Zhou called out to stop Third Aunt. \u201cIf it not a difficult dish, then cook it in a while. Today we caught a pheasant. Zhao Sao-zi will cook it and bring us a bowl!\u201d\u201cPheasant?\u201d Third Aunt\u2019s eyes immediately lit up and hurriedly to ask what happened.Lian Ze was enthusiastic to answer as if praising Ah Jian also make his face glow. He earnestly recounted everything.Lian Fang Zhou knew without guessing, how Third Aunt would react. She turned around to walk out to wash her hands and face.Third Aunt had no interest in praising Ah Jian\u2019s skills.As predicted, she just turned around and heard Third Aunt rapidly questioned. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying Ah Jian shot down a pheasant? Then why did you let Zhao Mei Zi take it? How clever of her! Just cook one bowl for use? Hmph, who knows whether the pot she gave us is bone or meat! No, it can\u2019t do, I must go over to her place!\u201dOriginally Lian Fang Zhou wanted to stay out of this matter, but now she can\u2019t. She rushed to halt Third Aunt: \u201cDon\u2019t go! What\u2019s the point of quibbling over every little detail? Whether it\u2019s more or less, it\u2019s alright! We still need to rely on Uncle Li and Brother San Ge on the charcoal!\u201dThird Aunt still couldn\u2019t accept it. She harrumphed as she glared at Lian Fang Zhou. \u201cYou\u2019re really generous. I\u2019m afraid someone going to become more and more greedy. It was said that you were very fierce against the Hua Family\u2019s daughter-in-law. I believe that was most likely not real?\u201dAs she spoke, she dragged Ah Jian over. \u201cAh Jian got a powerful body. From what I see, two of your Uncle Li and Brother San Ge added together still isn\u2019t enough to match up! What relying on them! Who would believe that!\u201dLian Fang Zhou was speechless. Third Aunt is very talented in calculating gain and loss. Lian Fang Zhou could not refute these words.\u201cHow could Hua Family\u2019s daughter-in-law compare with Aunt Zhang?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou wrinkled her brows.\u201dI said can\u2019t go, then you can\u2019t go! How much did Aunt Zhang and Uncle Li help us?Stifled with anger, Third Aunt simply sat down. \u201d Fine then, you said can\u2019t go, then I won\u2019t go. You\u2019re the family head anyway! One matter is one matter, who would say it like you? So, if that Mrs. Zhao asks you for money, you will also give it to her? She said borrow, then what about returning it? If she doesn\u2019t return, could you ask for it back?Lian Fang Zhou replied, \u201cIsn\u2019t there still Aunt Zhang? I have my plans, so don\u2019t worry!\u201dSeeing the two of them started quarreling, Ah Jian hurried to intervene. \u201cThird Aunt, listen to Fang Zhou. Isn\u2019t it just a pheasant? Next time I see one, I\u2019ll catch it!\u201dInitially, Third Aunt was just feeling indignant and grumbled a bit. She dare not disobey Lian Fang Zhou. Ah Jian\u2019s words made her sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re also helping her. You guys breathe out with the same nostril. What else can I say\u2014 Could you hunt some rabbit?\u201cSure!\u201d Ah Jian nodded.\u201cAny other? Can you catch others?\u201d Immediately Third Aunt was full of curiosity.Ah Jian laughed and nodded after some giving it some thought. \u201cAs long as you can name it, wild goats, wild deer, roe deer, marmot, muntjac\u2026 I think I can!\u201d\u201cWonderfully! That\u2019s just perfect!\u201d Third Aunt started cheering and ordered Ah Jian. \u201cNext time hide it from the Li family, especially that insatiably greedy Mrs. Zhao!\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Ah Jian agreed with a nod.Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che heard Ah Jian talk that impressive; they couldn\u2019t help pester him with endless questions. Ah Jian was very patient with them. He answered each question one by one with a smile, making the two little guys exclaim in admiration.Lian Fang Zhou had already walked away as if she didn\u2019t hear anything.Not long later, Mrs. Zhao brought over a big bowl of soup of stewed mushroom and pheasant in a bamboo basket. And the top was covered with a lid.Once the lid was uncovered, the aroma overflow. Lian Fang Qing took a deep breath in and her mouth watered. \u201cSmells so good!\u201dWhen the authentic aroma floated out, no one could resist the temptation. Even Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t help move her fingers toward the table. She gave her thanks with a grin.Mrs. Zhao carefully placed the pheasant soup on the table and beamed. \u201cStewed mushroom and pheasant garnished with ginger slice and scallion. Will be very savory! It\u2019s split in half between us, two families. We didn\u2019t take any more than that!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You\u2019re acting like a stranger!\u201d Hearing these words, Lian Fang Zhou immediately felt bothered. She smiled, \u201cIt was hard on you Sao-zi. You should have left more for yourself!\u201d\u201cIt was no trouble, no trouble at all! It what I should do! Haha, us two families are very close. It should be like this; you help me, I help you, right?\u201d Mrs. Zhao promptly laughed.\u201cThat\u2019s right, it just like that!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou chattered for a while longer before sending Mrs. Zhao out.When she returned, Third Aunt continued jabbering. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a whole half! The thigh and the breast are there. Even the blood and organ! That Mrs. Zhao is smart, to think of the future!\u201d\u201cCook the dinner!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou was very helpless. The Third Aunt right now has changed a lot but she still as unbearable as ever.Third Aunt didn\u2019t care about Lian Fang Zhou not responding to her, she mumbled into the kitchen.Lian Ze\u2019s mind was full of Ah Jian\u2019s martial art lesson. After dinner, he impatiently looked at Ah Jian.Ah Jian didn\u2019t understand his meaning, instead, he only detected his nod and a slight smile.Lian Fang Zhou watched with a secret smile. She suggested, \u201cAh Jian, after a few days, you should teach Ah Ze. For a specific day, you two should discuss it.\u201dLian Ze followed with, \u201cHow about tomorrow? Tomorrow is good!\u201dAh Jian contemplated for a moment, then looked at Lian Fang Zhou. \u201cI\u2019ll explain it to him first and make some preparation. In three we\u2019ll start?\u201d\u201cI have no objection. You should do what you need! Take it step by step, don\u2019t injure your body!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou replied.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll keep an eye out, definitely won\u2019t let Ah Ze get hurt!\u201d Ah Jian grinned.Lian Fang Zhou nodded with a smile.Thrilled, Lian Ze rubbed his hands and promised, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Sister, I\u2019ll be careful! Big Brother Ah Jian you can be more strict, I can take it\u2026\u201dThe next day, they were busy chopping for most of the day and had all the necessary wood cut up.In the afternoon, Ah Jian, Lian Fang Zhou, and Lian Ze were responsible for cutting the wood that was brought over to the side of the kiln to one-meter length. After drying them for a few days, they can then load the kiln up and light it up.After lighting it up, they need to burn a lot of firewood. Aunt Zhang\u2019s family is in charge of getting firewood.Kiln fire is different to a stove fire. It needs long lasting thick firewood.Fortunately, the mountain doesn\u2019t lack them, just need to spend effort.So they were busy for another two days before they finally loaded the kiln and lit it.A raging big fire burned in the kiln\u2019s oven. From the chimney, plumes of smoke emerged and get scattered by the wind and disappear into the air.Looking at the continuously emerging and disappearing smoke, everyone was feeling nervous. Because in the end, it has a lot of connection to whether it succeeds or not.Whether they have a comfortable and warm winter or a chilling wallet-tight winter depend on this.As long as this one succeed, then they can dig out another three kiln at the side. When the time comes, with four kilns burning at the same time and burn five to six time, they don\u2019t have to worry this winter.\u201cNext the kiln needs to burn strong for the next days and nights. It can\u2019t be interrupted in the middle! How should we work this out? At night we need someone to keep watch to add wood anytime.\u201d Lian Fang Zhou explained.Uncle Li proposed, \u201cIt\u2019s enough with San Ge and I taking turns. In the day let your Aunt Zhang and Mei Zi come. You siblings must be exhausted from the last few days. Go rest up!\u201d\u201cHow could that do? If this doesn\u2019t change, and by chance, you sleepily feed the fire. Then fire won\u2019t burn strong and all our effort is wasted!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou rushed to point out.Hearing this, Lian Ze followed up, \u201cSister, how about we do it like this? Ah Jian, Uncle Li, Brother San Ge and I take turns watching the night shift. In the day, you three and Third Aunt take turns.Everyone considered it. They felt it was pretty good and had no objection and settle like that.The first night was Ah Jian\u2019s and Lian Ze\u2019s turn. In Uncle Li\u2019s and others\u2019 eyes, Ah Jian was an expert. So they did not fight with them over it.Ah Jian and Lian Ze took a blanket to wrap around with and went early in the evening to the fire. Lian Fang Zhou felt uneasy and went with them.They didn\u2019t need to bring a blanket because with such a big fire burning in the kiln, it can\u2019t be cold in the evening.Not only is it not cold, but because of the high temperature, they can\u2019t be near the kiln.The three of them chose a spot that\u2019s convenient to watch the fire and also not too hot.Lian Ze couldn\u2019t help start pestering Ah Jian with questions about learning martial arts.Lian Fang Zhou laughed as she chided. \u201cYou ah! Don\u2019t rush, take it slowly! The future days are long, and there are still two days left. The fire still needs to be watched. Today I\u2019m here, so it\u2019s fine. But if I weren\u2019t here in the future, you guys would be immersed in talking and mess things up! In every matter, you need to able to prioritize!\u201dLian Ze heard his sister\u2019s words and deep understood that it was very possible and felt fearful.As he was going to reply, Ah Jian grinned at Lian Fang Zhou. \u201cNot to worry, I\u2019ll pay attention! I promise we won\u2019t mess things up. It\u2019s rare for him to have such an interest, may as well let him be.\u201dNaturally, Lian Ze loves to, but he was still uneasy. Only when Ah Jian promise it\u2019s okay and Sister didn\u2019t say anything did he feel a ease.Since Ah Jian said it like this, Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t object anymore. The more they chatted, the more enthusiastic. At the start, she found their conversation interesting, but later she was tired. She yawned a few times as her eyelid start to droop. Unconsciously she tucked up by the pile of firewood and fell asleep.When Lian Fang Zhou woke up, it was in the middle of the night. The cold blue, cloudless sky had numerous thickly dotted stars, creating an astonishing sight as if was a fairyland. After looking at it for so long, she felt as if she forgot where she is.\u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201d A warm, soft voice sounded out. Lian Fang Zhou slightly tilted her head. Ah Jian was shooting a smile at her.She swept her gaze around and found Lian Ze who fell asleep at some unknown time.Ah Jian whispered, \u201cLet him sleep. He\u2019s exhausted from the last few days. Don\u2019t worry; the fire is still strong!\u201dLian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t help laugh and whisper back, \u201cIt should you who is tired! I\u2019ll keep watch for a while and you nap as well.\u201d\u201cNo need, I\u2019m not tired\u201d Ah Jian shook his head.Lian Fang Zhou continued. \u201cHow can you not be tired? Even if you aren\u2019t tired, you still need to rest. These days you worked harder than us!\u201dAfter pausing, she lightly sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to you, or else\u2026\u201dAh Jian laughed. \u201cYou guys took me in. I\u2019m just doing what can. I\u2019m not tired at all. Don\u2019t worry; if I need to rest, I\u2019ll let you know. \u201dSeeing that he persist in not resting, she could only leave it be. He pondered for a moment. \u201cIn that case, then let\u2019s talk! What do you think of Ah Ze- Is his physique suitable for learning martial arts?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t see anything wrong. Since he has the heart and can succeed in learning, then it\u2019s good!\u201d Ah Jian glanced over. He paused before continuing. \u201cI can see that he is learning this for you, right? He wants to protect you and also his younger siblings.\u201dLian Fang Zhou lightly breathed out. \u201cActually, it\u2019s enough that has that heart. Hmph, it\u2019s not going to be easy for those who want to bully me!\u201dDon\u2019t know if Ah Jian didn\u2019t understand what she said or if he is pretending not to follow; he nodded in agreement: \u201cWith me here, you don\u2019t have nothing to worry about! Other matters, I don\u2019t understand but at least get robbed, or something won\u2019t happen.\u201dLian Fang Zhou burst out laughing. \u201cWhat you said is pleasing to hear! I think that one day you\u2019ll have to leave!\u201d\u201cYou, you\u2019re thinking of kicking me again!\u201d Straight away, Ah Jian became agitated.Again? Lian Fang Zhou felt speechless on the inside. Isn\u2019t it just not agreeing to him staying at the start? Thus becoming a bad guy forever?\u201cThat\u2019s not it,\u201d Lian Fang Zhou quietly said. \u201d You have your own family and own relative. One day you\u2019ll remember everything. When you remember, you\u2019ll naturally want to leave. Don\u2019t even need me to push you out.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

While I\u2019m at it, I must tell you something. You can rest at ease as you help us do work now. When the time comes for you to leave, I will prepare sufficient traveling fund for you!\u201dHis own family? His relatives?Hearing these words, he looked up to the sky, which was filled with numerous dotted stars, as if his memory was deep within the starry sky. But he couldn\u2019t find it no matter how much he searches.\u201cActually, since I lost my memory, there hasn\u2019t been one day without thinking of this problem. But no matter how much I think, even til my head hurts, I still can\u2019t make anything out. So I already gave up thinking. When I can remember, then I will remember. It\u2019s useless to think about it anymore!\u201d Ah Jian sighed with melancholy.It would be a lie to say he doesn\u2019t think of his past.Lian Fang Zhou nodded with a smile. \u201cThinking like is right! Take things as they come. I believe Heaven will favor the good! One day you\u2019ll remember everything!\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll take your word for it!\u201d Ah Jian smiled. Suddenly he frowned again and exhaled out. \u201cEven though I can\u2019t remember anything, but when I have time to settle down, my heart feels empty and anxious, as if there\u2019s an urgent matter waiting for me to do\u2026But no matter how much I try, I can\u2019t remember what it is. I could only feel more and more uneasy.\u201dLian Fang Zhou quickly comforted him. \u201cCan\u2019t remember who you are, what\u2019s your past was like or whether you have any worried family member. Of course, you\u2019ll feel uneasy! For the time being, you don\u2019t have to worry. Wait till we go to the county town, spend some money and rely on a few out of town roadside tea shed to keep an eye out. Maybe there\u2019s a chance that one your family come here to search!\u201dAh Jian\u2019s eyes lit up and ecstatically exclaimed. \u201cGreat! It\u2019s a wonderful idea. It\u2019s just that\u2026 you\u2019ll have to spend money!Lian Fang Zhou chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re too honest and down to earth. Just with your strength alone, we already benefit a lot from you staying at our place.\u201dThey became merrier as they chatted.Not long later, it gradually became brighter. In the early morning in the autumn mountains, everywhere was covered in thick fog accompanied with gusts of wind. If there weren\u2019t for burning kiln, who knows how cold it can be.Lian Ze has already woke up for a while. The three of them kept on burning as they talked, waiting for Aunt Zhang and her daughter-in-law to switch shift.The sun gradually rose up, and the thick fog cleared up. Aunt Zhang and her daughter-in-law rushed over after they had breakfast.Mrs. Zhao had a bamboo basket hanging from her elbow. Inside were a pot of soup and three set of tableware.Because Aunt Zhang was worried about the cold weather, she especially had it brought over for the three of them to warm up their body before they left the mountain.Lian Fang Zhou and the other two gave their thanks and drank the soup. They gave some simple instructions to the Aunt Zhang and Mrs. Zhao before carrying the empty basket down the mountain.After drinking a hot soup and walked down the mountain road, their exhaustion faded away, and they no longer felt tired when they reached home.After they washed up and had breakfast, Lian Fang Zhou went to look around the vegetable patch.In the southwest, the lowest temperature was at most four to five degree in the winter. Usually, it\u2019s around eight to nine degree. Winter is the perfect growth time for every type of green leafy vegetable and cabbage. At this time, you can already see big, glossy green leaves.She pulled some weeds and transplant some seedlings\u00a0in the vegetable patch. Only when it was around noon, did she feel drowsy and went to nap.Lian Ze couldn\u2019t wait for anymore. That very afternoon, under Ah Jian\u2019s teaching he practiced horse stance and strengthened the basic skills. Lian Fang Qing found it fun, so she also giggled as she learned at the side. When Lian Che saw his brother frowned a bit, he pulled her away.Lian Fang Zhou understood his intention and seeing that he doesn\u2019t feel tired, she let him be.After two more days, they can finally seal the kiln.The charcoal kiln would be weighed down by the soil when the fire is extinguished. Everyone looked at each other. Their heart was apprehensive.Because when burning the kiln, you can at least see what\u2019s happening. But now it\u2019s sealed, whatever changes inside can\u2019t be seen!Since they can\u2019t see, naturally they would be more anxious.\u201cThis, can it succeed right?\u201dLi San Ge couldn\u2019t help nervously asked Ah Jian.\u201cThere should be no problem! Just waiting for the charcoal to char. Three to four days should be enough.\u201d Lian Fang Zhou calmly answered, even though she felt a bit worried at heart.\u201cOk!\u201d Li San Ge felt at ease after she laid out the plan. He treated it as Lian Fang Zhou had asked Ah Jian before, and did not overthink of it when she answered his question.\u201cThis, do we still need to guard it?\u201d Uncle Li meticulously askedGuard it? There\u2019s no fire, and there\u2019s also no place for shelter. What if they got sick from keeping watch deep in the mountain during the night?Let\u2019s not mention that they can\u2019t afford to become sick; there\u2019s also the fact that medical treatment standards at this age are very doubtful.Lian Fang Zhou rushed to say, \u201cThis matter, only we know and here is deep in the mountain. I think we don\u2019t need to? It was cold here. Wouldn\u2019t it be troublesome if we caught a cold?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right! If we caught the chill, then we\u2019ll have to spend money on medicine!\u201d Mrs. Zhao quickly followed up. She left her unspoken words to stay in her stomach.\u2018By chance, we weren\u2019t successful in making charcoal, not only would we not earn money but also make a loss from grabbing the medicine. It wouldn\u2019t be worth it!\u2019Uncle Li, Aunt Zhang and the others felt what Lian Fang Zhou said was reasonable, so they agreed. They settled on waiting four days and then come back here to look.In angst, they passed four days. That day in the afternoon, they came together to open the kiln.When Ah Jian and Li San Ge carefully dug out the top of the kiln, many pairs of eye swept over at the same time to look, both worried as well as hopeful.Finally, they dug out an opening and afterheat come pouring out. At that moment, everyone\u2019s heart stopped a beat. Then they\u00a0all happened to cheer at the same time.They have never felt that black could look so great. Those upright pieces in the middle of the kiln are successfully made charcoal!\u201cSuccess! Success! Aiya, mother, it succeeded!\u201d Mrs. Zhao was so delighted that her eyes glowed and her mouth nearly reached her ears.In her eyes, those dark charcoal are shiny white silver.\u201cThat\u2019s right! That\u2019s right! Haha, this is wonderful!\u201d Aunt Zhang was also a little bit excited.Lian Fang Zhou was overjoyed as well, and at the same time, her heart relaxed. This winter, they should be pretty well off.\u201cTomorrow we should make a trip to town and check out the market information. \u201d Uncle Li suggested to Lian Fang Zhou.Naturally, Lian Fang Zhou agreed. If the market condition is right, then they\u2019ll dig out another three-four kiln and burn all in one go.At the side, she examined the freshly made charcoal and pointed out. \u201cThe time it took us to open the kiln is a bit long. A lot of this side\u2019s charcoal is burnt. Hm, seems like sealing for three days is enough for next time.\u201dNaturally, it\u2019s great being able to save one day. Uncle Li felt uncertain and asked Ah Jian if it was like that.Needless to say, Ah Jian nodded and said. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThe amount of charcoal made is estimated to be over a thousand jin. The whole Li family and Ah Jian carried it all back in one go. All of it was piled in Uncle Li\u2019s courtyard, waiting to sold in town the next day after they borrowed Wang family\u2019s cart.Seeing the charcoal piled into a mini mountain in their courtyard, Mrs. Zhao felt content like a blooming flower. The more she looked, the more delighted she is.Suddenly she was struck by an idea. She pulled Li San Ge to the side to quietly discuss. \u201cMaking charcoal isn\u2019t that hard! Didn\u2019t we learn it in one go? It\u2019s fine this time. How about next time each family makes their own? That way when doing the account, it wouldn\u2019t be troublesome to split. What do you think?\u201dOnce Li San Ge heard these words, he knew what Mrs. Zhao was thinking.\u2018She thinks that the fact Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze are kids and can\u2019t help out much, their own family were at a disadvantage!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He simply asked, \u201cThen let me ask you. If it weren\u2019t for Ah Jian, would we be able to make charcoal? We just learned it, and now you want to cast them aside. Can your conscience be at ease? They didn\u2019t ask for any money when teaching us. You also know that those who know how to make charcoal wouldn\u2019t be this generous. If you do this kind of thing, would you have any face to meet them in the future? Now pack away those thoughts as soon as possible. If dad and mum hear it hear it, you\u2019ll get a good scolding for a while!\u201dMrs. Zhao felt embarrassed or anger hearing these word, and discerningly pointed out with flushing cheeks, \u201cAh Jian isn\u2019t part of Lian Family, so how did I go against my conscience? I\u2019m doing this for our family. Look at what you\u2019re saying as if I was doing it for myself. From what I see, you\u2019re the one who\u2019s heartless, to accuse me like this!\u201dShe spoke with reddened eyes and nearly teared up.From the start, Li San Ge wasn\u2019t a fine talker like Mrs. Zhao, so hearing those words, he couldn\u2019t refute. In a fit of anger, he stomped his feet and bellowed. \u201cYou better say less! No matter what, this matter not going to happen!\u201dAunt Zhang saw her son and his wife were whispering in the courtyard. When her son suddenly raised his voice, it nearly scared the hell out of her. With a frown she chided. \u201cWhy are being so fierce to your wife? What? Is it because you feel more superior now that you know how to make charcoal? We still have yet to sell the charcoal for money, and you\u2019re already causing a scene! Now stop talking!\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201d Li San Ge didn\u2019t say anything, just sulked out a faint response to let this matter vaguely pass and walked away. He knew if he explained, his wife would definitely be scolded.Mrs. Zhao saw that he didn\u2019t say anything, her tense heart relaxed. She stood there alone, staring blankly into space. Then let out an aggrieved sigh and also went back into the house.Early the next day, Li father and son, Ah Jian and Lian Fang Zhou entered the\u00a0city together.Since he got free time, Lian Ze went to the backyard and practiced the basics again.Now is the middle of October, still have not become winter yet. Charcoal has yet to be sold on the street. In a moment, the four of them was immediately troubled.They stood out a lot when their cart entered the city. Many people that passed by thought how once winter comes, they\u2019ll need charcoal and if they buy it now, maybe they\u2019ll get it a cheaper. So they then went up to bargain the price.How would Lian Fang Zhou and the others know the price? The four of them stared at each other. Uncle Li and Li San Ge were so nervous that they started to sweat.No matter what, they had already come here and ended up pulling back everything. Anyway, the woods in the mountain isn\u2019t worth much.Just when Uncle Li gritted his teeth and planned to give a random price, Lian Fang Zhou had already spoken out. \u201cWe\u2019re not selling the charcoal yet, need to wait a moment.Those who heard this answered with an \u2018oh\u2019 or mumbled and left. There were some who was extremely curious and stuck around to find out the reason and also wanted to get a price no matter what. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you selling it now?\u201dLian Fang Zhou was somewhat mad on the inside and indifferently said, \u201cIf you want to know, come back later!\u201dSeeing the situation, some people just let it go, while others became a little angry. One of them said, \u201cYou\u2019re so unreasonable, little girl. You already brought it to the city and if you\u2019re not selling it, are you planning on pulling it back like this? The adults in your family have yet to speak. What can a little girl like you understand!\u201dAlthough Uncle Li doesn\u2019t know why Lian Fang Zhou said it like this but seeing her being snapped at, obviously he would help her. \u201cWhat my niece said counts. Come back later!\u201dOnly then did those people unwillingly left. When they walked away, a good few criticised with words like \u2018don\u2019t know how to do business!\u2019Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t let it get to her.\u201cFang Zhou, for what reason? We can\u2019t bring the charcoal back like this!\u201d Li San Ge was also a bit agitated.Lian Fang Zhou giggled. \u201cBrother San Ge, don\u2019t be anxious! Of course, we\u2019ll sell the charcoal. It\u2019s just that we don\u2019t know the price, so how do we sell it? Won\u2019t it be unfortunate, when we sell it at a loss? I was thinking like this. We should leave one here to keep watch, and the other three goes off on their own and investigate last year\u2019s price of charcoal. This way we have something to base on, right?\u201cAh!\u201d Li San Ge slapped his own head. He laughed, \u201cWhat you said is reasonable. Why did I not think of it!\u201dUncle Li dipped his head in agreement. \u201cSince it\u2019s like that, Fang Zhou, you stay here and keep watch. We\u2019ll go ask around.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better to let Ah Jian stay here.\u201d Lian Fang Zhou vigilantly glanced at their surrounding. And jokingly said, \u201cI can\u2019t suppress it if someone one comes looking for trouble!\u201dThis made the four of them burst out laughing.Uncle Li grinned. \u201cLian Fang Zhou really thought of everything! Might as well let you two wait here then.\u201dLian Fang Zhou is a girl, after all, so Uncle Li said this out with a kind heart.However, Lian Fang Zhou had wanted to look around personally and urged, \u201cIt\u2019s enough with Ah Jian here. I also go. With the three of us asking around separately. We\u2019ll find out more about the situation with one more person.Uncle Li and Li San Ge couldn\u2019t persuade Lian Fang Zhou, could only agree. The three of them discussed for a while and then moved out in three different directions.The street that Lian Fang Zhou took happened to be the farmer\u2019s market. She pretended to examine the wares on the stalls and asked when casually chatting around and imprinted into her mind. Afterward, she went to sit at a tea spot for resting. In passing, Lian Fang Zhou asked a person who was drinking tea like her on their view of whether it was expensive or not.After talking, she got the general gist of it.When Lian Fang Zhou returned to where the cart stopped, Uncle Li and Li San Ge weren\u2019t back yet. But instead, she saw a young girl wearing a white damask long dress, claret vest scattered with floral design and a dark green belt hanging on her waist, like a servant attire, talking to Ah Jian.She thought it was just a wealthy family wanting to buy charcoal, so didn\u2019t pay much heed to it. But when she got closer, she could hear the servant girl\u2019s words. Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s expression couldn\u2019t help change.She heard the servant arrogantly told him, \u201cI say, from your accent, you\u2019re not from here. So you must have come here to earn a living! This is easy to settle then! You follow me back. I promise you, our Master and Young Miss won\u2019t mistreat you! How much do you earn a month in your current place? Our Young Miss said we\u2019ll give you double that\u2026\u201dWhat is the meaning of this?Immediately Lian Fang Zhou became furious. She loudly yelled \u2018Ah Jian\u2018 and walked over in long strides.Ah Jian was already impatient with the servant\u2019s pestering. When seeing Lian Fang Zhou return, he was overjoyed, and his face became a bit more high spirited as he called out. \u201cFang Zhou!\u201dThe servant girl turned around to scrutinize Lian Fang Zhou upon hearing this. Subconsciously pouted her lips and stood there in a reserved manner.\u201cThis miss, are you here to buy charcoal?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou monotonously asked.The servant girl harrumphed in disdain and steadily stared at her. \u201cYou can say that! Since our household use at least three to four thousands jins of charcoal in one winter. Although buying at this time is a bit early, but it\u2019s no matter. This bit of charcoal, I\u2019ll take it all doesn\u2019t make many differences!\u201dShe continued with a smile. \u201cMiss, these charcoal are yours?\u201dLian Fang Zhou assented with a \u2018yes\u2018.The servant girl then pointed at Ah Jian and questioned, \u201cSo then this guy work for you?\u201dLian Fang Zhou\u2019s brows subconsciously tightened. She doesn\u2019t like the tone of this servant and the way she spoke. She vaguely replied, \u201cAh Jian is temporarily staying at our place.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I found the right person!\u201d The servant girl clapped in joy. \u201cI\u2019m called Xi Que, Zhao Family\u2019s Young Miss\u2019s personal maid! Just now, our Miss\u2019s carriage was startled, and only did this man took action, that nothing terrible happened. Our Miss saw that he got excellent skills and wanted to hire him as a driver. State a price and give him to Zhao Family!\u201dXi Que fervently declared it with an expression saying \u2018state any price, what miss has is money.\u2019 The corners of her eyes proudly slanted at Lian Fang Zhou.Lian Fang Zhou found her hauteur attitude maddening as well as funny. A slave, without any freedom and her life and death the grip of someone else\u2019s hand, actually dare act high and mighty in front of her!If it were other matters, she would reject straight away. But Ah Jian is different. Ah Jian had lost his memory, and if he lived in the city, it would be much easier for him to ask around and also search for by other. So Lian Fang Zhou pulled him to the side and softly counseled. \u201cAh Jian, whether you want to go with her or not, you consider it carefully and decide for yourself. Perhaps it\u2019s more convenient to investigate for information if you live in the city\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to go to whatever Zhao Household. I\u2019ll return to Da Fang Village with you!\u201d Ah Jian shooked his head.Needless to say, Lian Fang Zhou was overjoyed that her eyes shone, but she was still hesitant. \u201cYou, you don\u2019t need to consider for a bit? After all\u2013\u201d\u201cNo need. Didn\u2019t you say we can rely on someone to ask around?\u201d Ah Jian firmly rejected with his head shaking.He had lost his memory, not his brain. What that Zhao Family\u2019s Miss saw in him were his strength and skills. Only in Lian Family\u2019s eyes, he could see equality and respect. For some unknown reason, he cared about that.If not, on the journey, he would have already had a place to stay and wouldn\u2019t be here in Yu He County, right?It\u2019s because the people he met, all had shining eyes when seeing his strength and enthusiastically pressed him to stay with the thoughts of treating him as a servant to order around. So without exception, he rejected them all.This Zhao Family\u2019s Miss is no different from them.Hearing his remark, Lian Fang Zhou subconsciously relaxed and nodded. \u201cOh, that\u2019s also fine!\u201dFinally, she turned to speak to Xi Que. \u201cSorry, Miss Xi Que, Ah Jian isn\u2019t willing. So, please return!\u201dInstantly, Xi Que was shocked still. She couldn\u2019t believe it and doubtfully looked at Ah Jian.Ah Jian affirmed, \u201cWhat Fang Zhou said is correct. Many thanks for Miss\u2019s good intention!\u201dXi Que became troubled. She couldn\u2019t handle such a small matter, what would Young Miss think of her? At that moment she couldn\u2019t care about anything else and walked a few steps over. She stared unwaveringly at Ah Jian and questioned, \u201cDon\u2019t you know which Zhao Family\u2019s Miss is our Miss? Half of Yu He County\u2019s silk and satin workshop, embroidery workshop, pawn shop and restaurant are part of our Zhao Family\u2019s business! Countless people would kill to work for our Zhao Family but can\u2019t since our Miss is extremely picky. If you didn\u2019t save our Miss, you could only dream of entering Zhao Household\u2019s door. Young Miss said, as long as you come, the wage is at least double!\u201dShe gritted her teeth before continuing, \u201cAt least two silver per month!\u201dAh Jian\u2019s eyelid didn\u2019t even flutter, his gaze remained calm. He turned down with a headshake. \u201cMiss, please go back!\u201dXi Que stomped her feet and glanced at Lian Fang Zhou with suspicion. \u201cDid someone threaten you? Someone not willing to let you go? No need to be afraid! You can tell me, our Zhao Family is one of the most eminent households in Yu He County. Even in front of the County lord, our Master can have a seat!\u201dLian Fang Zhou bit her lips to stop herself from laughing. At the same time, she steadily gazed at Xi Que. \u2018The world still has such conceited person, that\u2019s really rare.\u2018Ah Jian became somewhat impatient and asserted. \u201cI said I won\u2019t go means I won\u2019t go! Do you hear?\u201dXi Que was reduced to silence. However, she didn\u2019t give up, she turned to Lian Fang Zhou. \u201cMiss, I want all of your charcoal. Whenever you make charcoal, just send it all to Zhao Manor! No matter how much you give, we\u2019ll take it all! This person, you have to give him to our Zhao Family, how about it?This time Lian Fang Zhou flared up and aloofly replied. \u201cMiss Xi Que, your Zhao Family is very wealthy and ostentatious. You can have anyone you want, so why must it be Ah Jian? And also I had said that it\u2019s all up to Ah Jian to decide for himself. He\u2019s not willing to go, then there\u2019s nothing I can do!\u201d\u201cFang Zhou, Ah Jian, what happened?\u201d In the midst of talking, Uncle Li and Li San Ge returned and were giving a curious glance at Xi Que.Seeing more people coming over, Xi Que didn\u2019t want to drag it any longer. Her eyes spun around before softly spoke with a smile. \u201cBrother Ah Jian, my words counts anytime, so give it some more thoughts. When you decided, just come straight to the Zhao Family. Our Zhao mansion is in this city, just ask anyone, and you\u2019ll know!\u201dShe shot him a sweet smile and fluttered her eyes coquettishly as she spoke before swaying her hips as she left.Seeing this kind of acting, Uncle Li and Li San Ge got goosebumps instantly. You can\u2019t blame them, they\u2019re an honest farmer, so where could they see this before?Lian Fang Zhou also got chills all over her body, and internally she nearly rolled with laughter. Huh, even the beauty trap is used. Beauty trap is very picky, not just anyone can use it\u2026Some people would have the reverse effect if they used it.Lian Fang Zhou sneaked a glance at Ah Jian. Ah Jian\u2019s eyes were filled with disgust, and his brows pinched very high.\u201cZhao Family? Everyone in the city knows there\u2019s only one Zhao Family. How did you get mixed up with them?\u201d Uncle Li was surprised.\u201cCause I was too meddlesome,\u201d Ah Jian then gave a run down version of what happened.Uncle Li and Li San Ge exchanged a glance and was secretly sighed in relief. They agreed with his decision. \u201cIt was the right choice to not go with her. That kind of wealthy families only knows how to bully people! If you have a family here, it is a bit better, since you\u2019ll have someone to rely on if you ever suffer grievance. But since you aren\u2019t from here, with no root or support, you could only suffer bullying from everyone. It\u2019s better not to go!\u201dThey just started the charcoal business, and if they lost Ah Jian, it can\u2019t help make people feel lost.\u201cI won\u2019t go,\u201d Ah Jian assured.\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about them anymore. Uncle Li and Li San Ge, what have you found about the price?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou drew their attention back to the matters at hand.Uncle Li and Li San Ge voiced their findings, then Lian Fang Zhou. The four of them discussed for a while before settling on two hundred and twenty-five wen per one hundred jin. Last year it was two hundred and thirty wen for each hundred jin.Finally, they drove the cart to check the area of inns, restaurant, and shops first. If any of them need some, they would buy a more substantial amount.There were a good few wanted to order but weren\u2019t content with the price. They wanted to drop it by five to six wen, even ten wen. Who knows if, after some time, the cost of charcoal were cheaper. Buy it now was a bit early, but as long as they don\u2019t suffer a loss.Lian Fang Zhou smiled. \u201cNow it\u2019s just entered October and the early morning frost almost didn\u2019t freeze people to death. It can be seen that this winter will definitely be cold. It goes without saying, charcoal need to be bought. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019ll become more expensive if this keeps on but it\u2019ll definitely won\u2019t be cheap. And also, wasn\u2019t it also this price last year? If it could get cheaper, it won\u2019t be cheaper than last year, right? And what\u2019s more, take a good look. Our charcoal wasn\u2019t impaired at all, it\u2019s one hundred percent made from burning hardwood. No smoke, resist burning and less ash residue. Those with discerning eyes can tell! We\u2019re testing the kiln, this trip, so that\u2019s why it\u2019s at this price. Next time it won\u2019t be at this price!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He inspected the charcoal again and found it undoubtedly high quality. He jollily remarked. \u201cMiss, the way you talk is very polished, it sounds very reasonable. Alright then, I\u2019ll buy some!\u201dAnother jokingly said, \u201cIf it really as great as Miss, then I\u2019ll buy from you guys next time!\u201dMaking everyone else laughed.Lian Fang Zhou candidly agreed. Not long later, those charcoal were all sold out.The four of them gathered together and counted the money. With a two thousand six hundred wen earnt, they were overwhelmed with joy.Li San Ge rubbed his hands together, and merrily voiced out, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t even been three days, and earned this much. When we get back, dig more kilns and make more charcoal, so we can sell more!\u201d\u201cI also had the same thoughts!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou grinned. \u201cNext time, we\u2019ll come back when it\u2019s a bit colder. Then we can increase another ten wen for each jin!\u201d\u201cAh, that much!? Aiya, this year we\u2019ll have a pretty comfortable new year!\u201d They all burst out laughing as chatted.Since it was a rare chance to enter the city, it goes without saying that they would buy some stuff before they return. Lian Fang Zhou and Ah Jian separated from the Li father and son, each buying their own stuff and it was still Ah Jian drive the cart.\u201cLet\u2019s go the four city entrance and entrust someone to look into your matter,\u201d Lian Fang Zhou told Ah Jian.\u201cAlright!\u201d Ah Jian acceded agreeably. After a pause, he continued speaking. \u201cNo matter what happens, I\u2019m very grateful to you!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say these aloof words!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou chuckled.This was initially a matter to do in passing and with the additional twenty coins and Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s and Ah Jian\u2019s extremely courteous attitude, those old men, who watched the tea sheds, agreed very straightforwardly with a delighted grin.After they instructed clearly, they returned back, and Lian Fang Zhou hastily brought some things; few dozens of jin of flour, few bolts of dense and fine cambric, two relatively thick felt blankets, as well as two jin of pork butchered, two pig\u2019s bone and a packet of sesame candy for the two little ones.Once they bought everything, they went to the arranged meeting spot and Uncle Li and Li San Ge was already there waiting.Lian Fang Zhou felt somewhat embarrassed and hurried to say, \u201cWas delayed for some time, made Uncle Li and Brother San Ge wait!\u201dUncle Li waved his hand, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing! Since it\u2019s a rare chance to come to the city, it\u2019s not strange to look around for something interesting.\u201dMaking everyone laughed. They chatted as they moved the things they bought onto the cart. Ah Jian jumped up to the driver seat and used the whip and drove them out of the city to return home.Let\u2019s not talk about Lian Fang Zhou and the others exiting the city to return back. In another place, in front of Zhao Family\u2019s Miss, Zhao Ru Jun was Xi Que, in the midst of reporting.\u201cYour servant has already investigated properly. That person is called Ah Jian, an outsider who came here to work. Your servant had explained it clearly to him. He said he\u2019ll go back and think it over. After two days, he\u2019ll give us an answer\u2026\u201d\u2018With two days efforts, she\u2019ll persuade him to work for Zhao Family, no matter what.\u2019Xi Que secretly vowed in mind.Before when she went to invite him, she had unreservedly boosted in front of Young Miss. Now she couldn\u2019t bring him back, what will Young Miss think of her? Will she (Young Miss) still be able to trust her from now from?Zhao Ru Jun is Master Zhao\u2019s only daughter. This year, she\u2019s nineteen. Not only is she an alluring beauty, but she also got the brains that many sharp-witted men can\u2019t beat!Currently, more than half of Zhao Family\u2019s business is managed by her. Not only did it not suffer any loss, instead it became more and more prosperous.In the beginning, those relatives of Zhao Family saw that Master Zhao had no son, they covetously eyed on Zhao Family\u2019s assets. Master Zhao\u2019s cousins tried different methods one after another to place their own sons at Master Zhao\u2019s side.Phrasing it nicely, they\u2019re there to help. But in reality, they\u2019re aiming for those properties.Everyone had the same plan: Master Zhao had no son to continue the line, then he\u2019ll have no choice but to choose one of the nephews to adopt, right?Toward this matter, Master Zhao was vexed as well as helpless.Of course, he was clear about their little scheme, but he had a total of seven concubines, and not one son was born, so besides adopting a nephew, there are no other solutions! He can\u2019t just let the\u00a0incense fire extinguish1and selfishly throw all those assets into the water! At most, he could pick a good one out of them.But Zhao Ru Jun had other thoughts.From young, Zhao Ru Jun was raised like a boy. At the age when one can grab things, she was already playing with an abacus; when kids start learning words, she was looking at accounts. Also, Master Zhao dotes her, so for several years, he took her with him when doing business.Taught through personal examples, Zhao Ru Jun has become an expert in business, despite her young age. Her formidable decision-making skills and intelligence is even more superior than her father.With this kind of person, it\u2019s only natural that she won\u2019t be willing to give her own family\u2019s asset to her cousins.When the cousins entered the Zhao Family\u2019s stores, Zhao Ru Jun didn\u2019t say anything and showed them all a warm, friendly smile.Everyone knew that she was the apple of Master Zhao\u2019s eye, so it goes without saying to compete in flattering her. As long as she praises a few words in front of Master Zhao, it\u2019ll be more effective than working with their life on the line to perform excellently.So, Zhao Ru Jun very easily sow discord and exacerbate everywhere without batting an eyelid.Then, without any notice, she placed everyone in a situation she planned. This made those cousins\u2019 selfishness clear before everyone\u2019s eyes.Beside dejectedly leaving Zhao Ru Jun\u2019s home, they have no other alternative.What\u2019s really impressive, was that no one held a single speck of grudge against Zhao Ru Jun and her father after such anticlimax ending. Instead, the connection between a lot of people turned into death; hating the other for undermining them and exposing their weakness.Afterward, in this situation with no other alternatives, Zhao Ru Jun and her father invited the clan elders to make a decision- Zhao Ru Jun taking a son-law to marry into their family and in future, the inheritances will go to her descendants. Naturally, the clan elders didn\u2019t put in their efforts for nothing.All the uncles and cousins calmly and peacefully accepted this ending, and no longer aim for Zhao Family\u2019s assets.They all had the same thought:\u2018In any case, I don\u2019t have a chance, but also I can\u2019t let any of you get it so easily!\u201dWhen this matter was settled, Zhao Ru Jun was only fifteen.If she suggested recruiting a son-in-law at the beginning, the clansmen would definitely not agree. They had already thought of Zhao Family\u2019s assets as if it\u2019s entirely natural for them to own, so how could they be willing to let an outsider profit? But after experiencing this period of hardship, no one would disapprove. It can be seen how deep her thoughts are.Not waiting for others to hatch a plan on Zhao Ru Jun\u2019s recruiting husband matter, Master Zhao and his daughter had already publicly announced the criteria for the husband selection. This way they can reject those uncles\u2019 evil intentions.Want to marry in? Sure, just follow the rules! Failed to pass? Well, that\u2019s because your qualification isn\u2019t sufficient; can\u2019t blame anyone else!Of course, if she found someone she fancied, she will have a plan to make that person fit the criteria.But the problem is that after so many years, she still hasn\u2019t found anyone that can enter her eyes.However, she wasn\u2019t anxious. As long as she nods her head, would she still not be able to find a husband?Hearing Xi Que\u2019s words, Zhao Ru Jun remained silent and her slender white hand held a teacup, while her other hand used the lid to lightly dabble with the tea foam and hanging by the side of her face were seed-beaded tassel, which slightly shook. It shows a completely leisurely demeanor. The imposing aura exuding from within her made people unable to stare at her.A strand of pressure that can make one nervous flowed into the atmosphere.Subconsciously, Xi Que licked her lips, and her breath became blocked as if her throat was gripped by an invisible hand.\u201cTell the truth!\u201d After a pause, Zhao Ru Jun spoke lightly. Her tone carried a hint of laziness, and within that laziness laced with power that allows no defiance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In a trembling voice, she owned up. \u201d That Ah Jian\u2026 he\u2026 he\u2019s really ungrateful, to actually not come! And that master of his was also saying bad things and instigating him at the side! I should not have lied to Miss, your servant deserve death!\u201dZhao Ru Jun glance at her said indifferently, \u201cDeath is too severe, beating is more like it! As you have attended me for so many years, you should know my personality? What I hate the most is people lying to me! In a while, go accept your punishment, ten slaps! And also.\u201dZhao Ru Jun roughly ponder for a moment, then continued, \u201cThat person called Ah Jian or something, his abilities are superb. With one glance, you can tell he had practiced! Since you run your mouth with wild boasts at the beginning, then this will still be handled by you. No matter what, you have to bring him to our household!\u201dAlthough that person was dressed in a brown course cloth that was nearly washed white, the imposing air and composure embedded within him and those lustre like varnish and deep as the ocean eyes weren\u2019t ordinary.At that time, when he grasped the reins to control the frenzied horse, his movement was done in one smooth motion like flowing water. What was impossible matter in others\u2019 eyes, was a simple task that didn\u2019t need to be mentioned to him. With just his oblivious calmness, he outmatched countless people.Zhao Ru Jun had a feeling, that if she could recruit him for her own use, she\u2019ll definitely won\u2019t have anything to lose.\u201cListen carefully, for the wages, let him choose.\u201d Zhao Ru Jun came back from her thoughts and added on.Xi Que quickly acceded. But when the words registered in her mind, she was so surprised that she let out a cry and looked at Zhao Ru Jun. Seeing Zhao Ru Jun was coldly stared at her, she knew she had lost her composure and hurriedly hung her head down. \u201cYes, your servant understand!\u201dXi Que couldn\u2019t understand Zhao Ru Jun\u2019s line of thoughts, wondered if Miss wanted to repay her savior this way? Even if you wish to compensate your savior, you shouldn\u2019t use this method! No matter who it is, with this chance, they\u2019ll definitely open their\u00a0mouth like a lion.1What she didn\u2019t know was that Zhao Ru Jun deduce that Ah Jian wasn\u2019t that kind of person. With that kind of skills and that kind of aura, he\u2019s definitely not that type of person.Lian Fang Zhou and Ah Jian had returned home. Those at home saw that the bought a lot of things again and also earned of money, became delighted and rejoice as they busied.Lian Fang Zhou announced with a grin. \u201cToday, we bought a lot of flour and also some diced meat, so let\u2019s have dumpling for dinner! In a moment I\u2019ll go to the vegetable patch and cut some chive, pull some celery and pick some cabbage, so we can use them with the meat as filling!\u201dIn the rural areas, it\u2019s a rare treat to be able to have to dumplings once or twice in a year, even more so for the meat filling ones. So, Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che are delighted. Third Aunt was also happy, she rushed to suggest, \u201cGet more vegetables, so we can make more! The days are getting colder so it can be kept for longer. We can also have it for breakfast tomorrow! Ah, it\u2019s better that I go to the veggie patch!\u201d\u201cAlright then, Third Aunt, you go!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou chuckled and did not stop her.Lian Fang Zhou called Ah Jian over. Se then counted six hundred wen and gave it to him. Not waiting for her to speak, he had already pushed it back to her. \u201cWhy are you giving it to me? I have no use for it even I have it!\u201d\u201cIf I don\u2019t give you, how can my conscious be at ease? You contributed a lot to making charcoal!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou pointed out with a smile.Ah Jian replied. \u201cI live here and also eat, wear and use your stuff. If I also take the money, I would be the one with a troubled conscious! So keep it! In future, if one day, when I remember who I am and decided to leave, you can prepare some traveling fund for me then.Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t change his mind, could she complied. She treated it as saving the money on his behalf. In her mind, she pondered about later in the evening, if she should give twenty-thirty wen to Third Aunt, so she has some money at hand. During this period of time, it\u2019s a blessing that Third Aunt was helping out with some housework at home and watching over the two little ones.Third Aunt returned from picking vegetables. When Lian Fang Zhou saw the big bundle of cabbage, chives, and celery, she was speechless. With a laugh, she spoke. \u201cThird Aunt, we won\u2019t be able to use that much vegetables! It\u2019s a rare chance to have dumpling, honestly, less veggie and uses more meat.\u201cYou said the reverse!\u201d Third Aunt replied straight away. \u201cThe true way of doing it is to add lots and lots of vegetable! This way we can have two meals!\u201dIf it were before, Lian Fang Zhou would rather have all vegetable filling. But after living a period of time without oil, she felt like her eyes would light up whenever meat is mentioned.She had wanted to eat one meal of meat filled dumpling for a long while now, so would she be willing to listen to Third Aunt? Just the thought of those stocky dumplings filled entirely with meat, mmm, with one bite, spilled with meaty juice and the delicious taste of flour, mouthwatering pork and tasty vegetables merged together, it\u2019s a bottomless pit of deliciousness making the whole body comfortable!Lian Fang Zhou persuade with all her might; saying the next meal, they can have dumpling filled with egg and cabbage if they want and these days they\u2019re exhausted from work so must have one good meal; only then, did Third Aunt reluctantly agreed.Immediately, the whole family became busy. Third Aunt made the dough, Lian Fang Zhou washed the two jin cut of pork and cut it to pieces before mincing it, the other three Lian siblings washed the vegetables. Only Ah Jian got no task, so he went to the courtyard to chop firewood.After finishing chopping the pork, it was placed in a giant basin-like bowl. Then the chives and celery were finely cut into tiny pieces and added together to the bowl. Afterward, some chopped up scallion was sprinkled on top. A layer of salt was evenly distributed on top of all that, and with a bamboo chopstick, everything was mixed well. Soon the meat and vegetable were well combined.Third Aunt had already set aside the kneaded dough to rise and ordered Lian Ze to get water from well. She carefully cleaned the square table and pan, so it\u2019s ready for rolling out the dough. The pan is for holding the made dumplings.At this side, the entire preparation was done, Lian Fang Zhou had just brought over the bowl of filling over and asked \u201cThe dough is ready? We can make a lot of dumpling with these filling!\u201dThird Aunt began to whine when she saw the assembled filling. \u201cAiya! Why is there just this much vegetable? Such wasteful usage of meat!\u201dLian Fang Zhou grinned. \u201cMore than enough veg is added in. It\u2019s fine like this! It\u2019ll taste more scrumptious!\u201d\u201cThat goes without saying! With this much meat, how could it not be tasty\u2026\u201d Seeing that Lian Fang Zhou wasn\u2019t yielding, Third Aunt could only suffer a toothache for a while.After the dough raised enough, Third Aunt then scattered two handfuls of flour around evenly on the table. The dough was rolled into a few long sticks, and she squeezed out\u00a0tangyuan2-size lumps. Then Lian Fang Zhou rolled them out with the rolling pin.Lian Ze and the twins sat on one side, wanting to help but don\u2019t know how. Just from watching, Lian Fang Qing was itching for doing something. She eagerly asked: \u201cSister, Sister, what can we do? What can we do?\u201d\u201cYou guys?\u201d Third Aunt chortled. \u201cJust wait to eat!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t want to! We also want to help!\u201d Lian Fang Qing was unwilling. She kept staring at Lian Fang Zhou with longing.Lian Fang Zhou chuckled. \u201cIn a while, Sister will teach you how to fill and fold the dumpling. Sister needs to roll out more dough.\u201d\u201cSis, I\u2019ll roll them! Um, how about letting Big Brother Ah Jian do? Big Brother AH Jian got lots of strength!\u201d Then Lian Ze suggested and swiftly ran out to call for Ah Jian.Lian Fang Zhou wrily smiles and thought,\u2018this isn\u2019t a task about strength or not.\u2018Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Initially, Lian Fang Zhou thought Ah Jian wasn\u2019t willing to do this kind of housework, but who knew that he wasn\u2019t very particular about it. He went to stand at one side of the table, turned to ask Lian Fang Zhou cheerfully, \u201cDid you called for me to do this? Ok, teach me how to do it!\u201dLian Fang Zhou considered how with more people they can be quicker, so she demonstrated as she gave simple pointers. Afterward, she let him try.Lian Fang Zhou waited at the side to watch him messed up. However, Ah Jian never gave the chance to. With one try, he was able to master it. The dumpling wrap was rolled out fast, even and looks good.\u201cAh Jian is very skilled, to be able to do anything!\u201d Even Third Aunt couldn\u2019t hold back her praise when she saw. And also mentally added, -\u2018it was the right decision to let him stay!\u2019Lian Ze glanced over at Ah Jian. With a proud beam, he thought, how could such a small task trouble his teacher? He was able to master more difficult martial arts!In contrast, Ah Jian was acting modestly. He politely smiled and asserted. \u201cIt was Fang Zhou who explained so easy to understand.\u201dThis made Lian Fang Zhou burst out into chuckles.Lian Fang Zhou had her hands freed up, so she taught her three siblings how to fill and fold the dumpling. She showed them how to do each and every step.This was a slightly harder technique. The dumplings the three little ones made was supposed to be dumpling in essence but can\u2019t really be called one in shape. Looking at those oddly shaped appearances made them continuously laugh.And also Lian Fang Zhou had highlighted, \u201cOther parts doesn\u2019t matter but one thing you must definitely do is seal the filling in properly!\u201dThe three of them was afraid of leaving gaps, so they kept on pinching the edge hard with anxiety. Resulting in the dumplings looking much more terrible.Third Aunt couldn\u2019t bear to watch it anymore. With a bang, she stopped her doing the work at hand and criticized. \u201cYou call that dumpling!? It\u2019s a disgraceful sight! Ah Ze, you do this. I\u2019ll let you see what is truly called dumpling!\u201dThe Lian siblings studied Third Aunt\u2019s quick, smooth movement of holding the dough, filling it, enclosing it and pinched out neat folds. A full and bulging, neatly folded, snow white dumpling was produced. Compare to the siblings\u2019 weirdly shaped one, you can\u2019t compare them at all.The siblings gasped in surprise, \u201cThird Aunt is really cool!\u201dThird Aunt waved her hand. \u201cYou two little ones, go do what you\u2019re supposed to be doing one. With me here, is enough! Fang Zhou, go heat the water. Once the water boil, we can cook the first batch!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s so much. We\u2019ll also help out or else how long would it take for you to finish?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou quickly pointed out. Just when she finished speaking, she saw the pan had another four bulging, pretty dumpling on it. She immediately corrected herself. \u201cI\u2019ll go to the kitchen and boil water.\u201dWith this pace, it\u2019ll be as fast as them four siblings doing it!Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che helped to get the dough balls and lined the dumplings. They chatted and laughed lively as they watched the process in great relish.After the water boiled, Lian Fang Zhou came over. As expected, there are already a few dozen dumplings made. She happily said: \u201cI\u2019ll go cook them. In a while, we\u2019ll eat first before we make the rest.\u201d\u201cSister, I\u2019ll help you watch the fire!\u201d Lian Fang Qing cast aside the work at hand and gleefully declared. She followed her to the kitchen.Not long later, a large pan of the delicious dumpling was out of the steamer. Lian Fang Zhou used a bowl to hold them when she brought it out. She had also brought the small bowl and chopsticks. She merrily called everyone, \u201d Quickly eat these! Just perfect, I\u2019ll have this batch cooked. Tonight we\u2019ll be having a feast!\u201dIn the midst of the swirling steam, a fragrant smell drifted around. Everyone exclaimed out \u2018 smells delicious!\u2019 as they sat together to start eating.\u201cIt\u2019s really yummy! I had never had such delicious dumpling before!\u201d Lian Fang Qing took a bite, finding the taste was really unforgettable.Third Aunt also sighed out, \u201cLet\u2019s not about someone as young as you, even I haven\u2019t tried a dumpling like this before! With this generous amount of meat, how could it not be mouth-watering!\u201dCausing everyone to erupt in laughter.Lian Fang Zhou then laughed, \u201cWhat\u2019s this? Our life will definitely get better and better, so wait until you get tired of eating it one day! Hm, when it\u2019s New Year, we\u2019ll buy some pork again. While we\u2019re at it, we\u2019ll buy some lamb, chicken, fish and made few more kinds of dumpling filling!\u201d\u201cYou can really dream, ah! \u201d Third Aunt scolded with a smile at her.Lian Ze followed up, \u201cWe\u2019ll have enough when we make a few more batch of charcoal, so we\u2019ll do however Sister want it!\u201dThird Aunt heart was moved and thought of asking how much they earned from selling charcoal. She was so focused and overjoyed about the things they bought back, that she forgot to ask.After some thoughts, in this house, she\u2019s not the family head. There\u2019s a chance she might make Lian Fang Zhou displease if she asked. So why bother? She swallowed up the unspoken question and happily gobbled up the dumplings.Through the merry chatters, they quickly finished the big bowl of dumplings. Lian Fang Zhou had already brought over the second bowl of freshly cooked ones.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that we don\u2019t have any vinegar. Next time we\u2019ll need to buy some to dip in. The taste would we much better and not get tired of it.\u201d Lian Fang Zhou uttered.Third Aunt exclaimed. \u201cAiya, how could we get tired of it? We won\u2019t even if we had it every day!\u201dMaking everyone burst into laughter.With this bowl finished, everyone was stuffed. They started wrapping the rest of the filling into dumplings and neatly stored them there. Afterward, they tidied up and prepared to bathe and sleep.Third Aunt was in the kitchen washing the dishes when Lian Fang Zhou came in and gave her thirty nuggets to Third Aunt. \u201cThese days, it was hard on Third Aunt. Take this bit of money to keep at hand!\u201d\u201cFor me?\u201d Third Aunt was surprised as well as delighted. She smiled like a Cheshire cat as she reached out to receive it. But that and withdrew when it was midway. \u201cThis, there\u2019s no need! I\u2019m eating and living here as well as getting newly cutted-out clothes and newly made shoes. Which one of these isn\u2019t money? How could I still take your money!\u201d\u201cYou can just accept it!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou stuffed the big bundle handkerchief wrapped nuggets into Third Aunt\u2019s hand. She insisted with a grin, \u201cYou deserve it! Next time we profit, there\u2019s more!\u201d\u201cOh, this, I\u2019ll accept it then! Usually, I would have to refrain myself from asking you to buy some needle, threads and the like!\u201d Third Aunt no longer refuse. Hearing that there\u2019s more in future, She became blooming in joy, and all displeasure dissipate. After some contemplation, she turned to Lian Fang Zhou to express her usefulness. \u201cOne thing, yesterday, that woman, Mrs. Qiao wanted to enter our veggie patch to steal. When I saw her, I gave her a good scolding and drove her away! Next time she dares to come, I won\u2019t let her off!\u201d\u201cAunt is really outrageous! Third Aunt, I\u2019ll have to trouble you in the future!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou expressed.\u201cThat goes without saying! This kind of matter isn\u2019t suited for you young girls and the younger generation to do. In future, you\u2019ll still need to marry\u2013 cough, I need to wash the dishes. You should quickly wash up and sleep! The pot on the stove still has hot water!\u201dAll at once, Third Aunt recalled that Lian Fang Zhou had her engagement broken. So in the middle of her sentence, she changed the topis in an instant.Lian Fang Zhou also didn\u2019t expose that. She just nodded with a smile. \u201cOk, I\u2019ll go now then! You should also rest up early later.\u201dShe didn\u2019t care about it all. So what if she remained unmarried for the rest of her life?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 59": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Picking Up a General to Plow the FieldsChapter 58Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMaggie_As to Mrs. Qiao, what Third Aunt said was right. She is an elder after all.There\u2019s a lot of things Lian Fang Zhou can\u2019t do. From the beginning, she had asked Third Aunt to keep an eye out on ordinary days. Or else, even if it\u2019s a small petty matter, she has no might to dispute with Mrs. Qiao.If you argue about, then you seem to be stingy, and the younger generation can\u2019t act like that. If you don\u2019t bother with it, then other will gain an inch and want a foot. Perhaps, a whole other pest may appear!After getting the taste of benefits, Uncle Li\u2019s whole family, Lian Fang Zhou, and the others worked with great drive. Early the next day they headed to the mountain again.Another three kilns could be dug out in that area. So they\u2019ll end up with four holes. With one patch of charcoal, one family could earn around four to five silver! Making a few more rounds, it\u2019s also enough for a year\u2019s expenditure.This day, Lian Ze, Ah Jian, Uncle Li, and Li San Ge dugout the new kilns. While the women chopped the firewood and wood for charring.Because they had the previous experience, and also, more importantly, the abundant profit from the last time, they got three new kilns freshly made in a day and a half! After that, the men joined in chopping wood.What the mountain has is an endless amount of trees. With two and a half days, not only do they have the wood to be placed in the kiln ready, but they also had firewood for burning the kiln done too.Ah Jian, Lian Fang Zhou, Uncle Li, and Lian Ze, the four of them filled the kiln and lit it up. Aunt Zhang and Mrs. Qiao continued chopping firewood, looking for wood. Since even if this patch of kilns is finished, they still have a use for them.And also, under Zhao Ru Jun\u2019s order, Xi Que had rushed over to Da Fang village in a horse carriage the next day after breakfast with the address her subordinate found.Unfortunately, Ah Jian and Lian Fang Zhou were in busy earning money for New Year and had already headed to the mountain. So, Xi Que missed the boat.Toward this, Xi Que didn\u2019t find it too surprising.Rural people ma, how could they not go out and work in the daylight and stay at home?Thankfully, she was prepared for it.Xi Que took out a large red rectangular invitation from her bosom and handed it over to Third Aunt to let her give it to Ah Jian. Telling her, she\u2019ll be coming again tomorrow.Receiving the invitation, then he\u2019ll have to entertain guest or else it\u2019s terrible manner! Xi Que mentally praised how smart she was as she walked away pleased with herself.But she had forgotten that it was her, who dropped in the invitation, and it wasn\u2019t Ah Jian willingly accept it.And also, how could rural people understand these common courtesies? Lian Fang Zhou wasn\u2019t an inhabitant of this era, so she even doesn\u2019t know.Therefore, Xi Que\u2019s invitation was resplendently ignored.Ah Jian pushed it to Lian Fang Zhou with a frown. \u201cYou go brush it off!\u201dLian Fang Zhou responded: \u201cThis Zhao Family, how come they\u2019re this overbearing!? Can\u2019t they peacefully let it go? Let\u2019s just ignore them; tomorrow we\u2019ll go on like usual!\u201dAh Jian strongly approved.Waiting until the second day, when Xi Que came, Third Aunt returned that invitation without waiting for her to speak. With a face full of contempt, she also said, \u201cThis toy is pretty to look at but doesn\u2019t have any use at all. It\u2019s too hard even to use it to wipe the bottom clean. Take it back! Our family doesn\u2019t feed idle people. Ah Jian had already gone to work! While you ah, it\u2019s better for you to go back!\u201dXi Que was paralyzed from anger. Her hand was gripping on the invitation that Third Aunt stuffed back, somehow unable to recover her sense.Once she regained her wits, she glared at Third Aunt, and her first sentence was: \u201cI\u2019m the city\u2019s Zhao Family\u2019s people!\u201dThird Aunt wasn\u2019t the kind of person willing to suffer. Her eyes glared back even more force. \u201cI know that. You said before!\u201dAs she spoke, her lips had curled into a sneer, so what if you\u2019re from the city. Is the city that great? If it\u2019s so great, then why are you running to our countryside?Xi Que paused and thought for a moment. She frustratedly laughed at herself:that\u2019s right. Rural people don\u2019t understand these courtesies. It was her who thought too highly of them. It was like giving coquettish glances at a blind man. This old woman must have never entered the town before so it can be forgiven since she doesn\u2019t know Zhao Family.Xi Que calmly took a look at Third Aunt and opened her mouth to say some words of sarcastic ridicule. But reconsidered, when she remembered that Ah Jian was working for this family. Since she wants to take him from them, she can\u2019t start quarreling with her. Otherwise, what should she do, when they don\u2019t let him go.So whatever words she wants to say, can only wait until Ah Jian leave his employment first.Therefore, Xi Que gave a restrained smile and turned to leave.The next day during the evening, Xi Que came again.Seeing her, Third Aunt said with a long face on, \u201cI say, are you a haunting ghost that can\u2019t be dispelled? What thing does this poor household have that had pining for it? That is worth a few trips to come here!?\u201dAt Zhao Ru Jun\u2019s side, Xi Que gained some importance. She had always compliment herself to be \u2018more aristocratic than those ordinary family\u2019s proper miss.\u2019 Hearing Third Aunt\u2019s words, she considered how she is aiming at Ah Jian, and her face couldn\u2019t help start flushing. She bit her lips and glared at Third Aunt.How could Third Aunt be afraid of her? She rolled her eyes, impatiently waved her hands as she said, \u201cLeave, leave! Don\u2019t poke around here. I need to sweep the ground! In a moment, if you\u2019re dress get dirty, then don\u2019t blame me!\u201dXi Que glanced around the clean ground and became mad. She angerly vented. \u201cI say you rural woman, how could you say this kind of word!\u201d\u201cOh, who\u2019s family\u2019s miss is this? To actually come running to this rural woman to show off!\u201d Third Aunt raised her voice even louder as she took out a bamboo brush from the corner of the corridor.Xi Que wanted to flare up but can\u2019t. She could only resentfully retreated from of the courtyard to the outside. However, she remained there, unwilling to leave.With this, Third Aunt began wondering. She stretched out her neck to peek at her, mumbling a bit and no longer bother with her. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be that this lass got a spell cast on her\u2026 \u201dIt can be seen that the sun was setting, but Xi Que still didn\u2019t see him come back and anxiety started to set in. Unconsciously, she scraped the mud on under her feet. She still needed to rush back to the city. The sky is about to darken, so it\u2019s also not easy for the carriage to travel.Before the eyes, the remaining strip of sunset disappeared. Xi Que stomped her feet in frustration. She could only enter the carriage and doubled back.The next day, she had learned her lesson. Dawn had just broken out, and she pressed the driver to head to Da Fang village. That driver had already accompanied her for few trips now and was a bit fed up. Both his thoughts\u2019 and words\u2019 meaning was: Just attending to you, Miss Xi Que, do still even need to take care of Master, Madam and Young Miss?Xi Que only stared at him as she harrumphed and spoke. \u201cToday\u2019s trip, I won\u2019t let you do it for nothing! Thirty coins should be enough right? And also, this task was instructed by Miss. If you have the ability, then don\u2019t go!After finishing, she turned to get onto the carriage.Zhao Family doesn\u2019t have only this carriage. So how could it delay the masters from going out? She knew the driver dislike that he didn\u2019t get any reward for transporting her on a few trips.Towards her attitude, the driver also felt peeved. But for thirty coins, he disgruntledly swung his whips and drove the carriage. His mouth was still mumbling. \u201cSo pretentious, acting like a prestigious miss. Few days work, and all I get is just this bit of money. You still dare to brag\u2026\u201dXi Que\u2019s face turned white in indignation. Inside the carriage, she shot a fierce glare toward the curtain of the carriage that separated the outside and swore she\u2019ll definitely get the task done today!When Xi Que arrived at Lian\u2019s home, the Lian family had yet to leave. Only from Third Aunt\u2019s mouth, they all know Xi Que had been coming over every day.Seeing her coming here bright and early, Lian Fang Zhou was slightly speechless. That\u00a0\u00a0Zhao1Family must be really short of staff, otherwise, why are they set on hiring Ah Jian? I have never heard of any employer going this far before. Even the head-hunting company won\u2019t be this harassing, right?\u201cIt\u2019s better that you go explain it clearly to her! I don\u2019t know if she find it tedious to make a trip after a trip, but I am tired of looking at it!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou glanced at Ah Jian.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lian Fang Qing was in the midst of washing her face when she lifted her head and daintily called out. \u201cBig Brother Ah Jian, even if want to leave, I won\u2019t allow you to. Our family can\u2019t bear for you to leave.\u201dAh Jian grinned happily as his heart settled down. Then he turned to go out.\u201cAh Jian,\u201d Xi Que saw Ah Jian as if she found a giant gold nugget that had fallen down from heaven. That intense friendliness made Ah Jian step back. With a frown, \u201cDidn\u2019t I express it clearly? I\u2019m not going to Zhao family!\u201dXi Que came to a halt. She hadn\u2019t said it yet and already got rejected by him. She mentally called him a fool, blockhead and the likes. Today she had especially dressed up, did he not see that? If he saw, then how he could bear to reject her?\u201cIt\u2019s like this, \u201cXi Que stood her ground, as she softly spoke. \u201cThat xx day you saved our Miss, and since our Miss is a person who would repay her gratitude, she insisted that I must invite you to our household! Isn\u2019t the city better than here? There are so many people want to enter our household but can\u2019t. This is a great opportunity! Don\u2019t worry, Zhao Family won\u2019t mistreat you. Our Miss said how much salary you want, is up to you to choose. Once you enter our household, you\u2019ll also get two sets of new clothes. So don \u2018t be foolish anymore! You are our Miss\u2019s savior, once you arrive in Zhao Family, who wouldn\u2019t place important to you?\u201dNot waiting for her to finish, Ah Jian interrupted. \u201cAre you done speaking? Now it is my turn to speak. I\u2019m not going! Please return!\u201dThen he turned to leave.\u201cHold on a moment! \u201cXi Que became anxious. She rushed over to block Ah Jian from the front, and with a sheepish smile, \u201cI believe you didn\u2019t hear me. Our Miss said the salary is up to you to choose!\u201d\u201cPlease return!\u201d Without batting an eye, Ah Jian still repeated. Xi Que became anxious. She mentally cursed him non stop. She carefully inspected Ah Jian once. And immediately stomped her feet and reached out to grasp Ah Jian\u2019s sleeve. Her cheeks flushed as she quietly and coyly said: \u201cI\u2019m Miss\u2019s first class maid. If you\u2019re willing to go, how about I\u2026 I marry you-\u201dAs if he was burnt, Ah Jian hurried to fling her hands off him. He retreated backward, and with a frown, he bellowed: \u201cWHAT ARE YOU DOING?\u201dSince he came to Lian Household, Ah Jian always had a smile when he spoke with anyone. The Lian Family had never heard him shout like this before, especially when it carries anger.Inside the house, the Lian siblings, as well as Third Aunt, was shocked. They all looked blankly at each other.\u201cWhat\u2019s, what\u2019s going on? \u201cThird Aunt murmured.\u201cI\u2019ll go out check it out!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou rushed out.Xi Que thought that she, a real and gorgeous girl, taking the initiative to say this, Ah Jian would become speechless from joy. Who would have known that he would yell at her instead. She became embarrassed as well as enraged. Instantly tears welled up in her eye.\u201cAh Jian, what has happened?\u201dLian Fang Zhou asked.Xi Que immediately became unsettled. If Ah Jian spoke out the truth, would she still have the face to see people?Ignoring her own embarrassed anger, she stepped up, and her knees softened and kneeled in front of Lian Fang Zhou. She pulled on Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s sleeves and begged. \u201cMiss Lian, I beg you. Let Ah Jian go with me. I beg of you. No matter how much charcoal you make, I\u2019ll buy them all, alright?\u201dImmediately, Lian Fang Zhou felt a burst of disdain. This counts as negotiating condition right? If she agreed, what kind of person would she become? What\u2019s more, she never thought of accepting from the start \u2014 And what does this matter has to do with her?If Ah Jian wanted to go, although it\u2019s regretful that they\u2019ll lose their main working force, she still wouldn\u2019t say anything.\u201cI say, Miss Xi Que, didn\u2019t I already tell you? The decision is up to Ah Jian. Don\u2019t ask me. He is temporarily staying at our house. He\u2019s not our hired hand!\u201dLian Fang Zhou politely spoke and tried to pull off Xi Que hand. But Xi Que\u2019s hand was like it grew on her sleeve. No matter how she couldn\u2019t get it off. Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s face flashed a hint of annoyance. She might as well stand there unmoving.\u2018If you want to kneel, then kneel. Want to grab then grab!\u2019How is this begging someone? This is simply acting shamelessly!Xi Que, who had Miss Lian rolling off her tongue long and short as she continuously pleads, abruptly found that she was putting on a one-person show. She halted before her voice gradually turned quieter and no longer cause a scene.Lian Fang Zhou unexpectedly pull back her sleeve with great force from her grasp and said, \u201cMiss Xi Que, we still need to head up to the mountain to work. So do as you please!\u201dAh Jian was already run out of patience. So without any more thoughts, he turned to walk away.\u201cMiss Lian!\u201d Xi Que became frantic. She rushed forward to reach out two arms to stop Lian Fang Zhou. With reddened eyes, she sobbed. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you! Our Miss has already spoken out, if I cant invite Ah Jian back, she, she won\u2019t want me anymore.sob sob\u2026 Miss Lian, I beg of you to be kind. Let Ah Jian make a trip over, please. Staying or not, let him tell our Miss. This way I can report to our Miss!\u201dXi Que continuously begged Lian Fang Zhou. Ah Jian made her lose face, so she was too humiliated to ask him.Lian Fang Zhou wrinkled her brow and looked over to Ah Jian. After some consideration, Ah Jian spoke. \u201cI make a trip over to explain things clearly and come back.\u201d\u201cThe sooner you go, the sooner you come back,\u201d Lian Fang Zhou nodded. Although they haven\u2019t known each other long, she still understands Ah Jian\u2019s personality. It\u2019s impossible for Zhao Family to make him stay.\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful! Thank you, Miss Lian! Many thanks, Miss Lian!\u201dXi Que was overjoyed. She quickly asked. \u201cAh Jian, shall we go now?\u201dXi Que felt proud of her pity-seeking act on the inside. In her opinion, the reason for Ah Jian not willing to work for Zhao Family is because he never been to Zhao Family place or seen Zhao Family\u2019s ostentation. As long as he witnesses it, he will definitely change his mind.Ah Jian glanced at Xi Que, with full of cautiousness. \u201cYou go back first. I\u2019ll go by myself.\u201d\u201cWhy go to such trouble? I happen to have a carriage here! \u201cXi Que courteously grinned. Ah Jian gave her an apathetic gaze with inexplicable thoughts that need not be brought to open. If Xi Que could paw him in public, then who knows what she would do when nobody is around. Ah Jian doesn\u2019t want to gain some messy reputation.Xi Que understood Ah Jian \u2018s expression, her face immediately redden. Ashamed she said, \u201cThen, then I\u2019ll leave first. Don\u2019t make our Miss wait long.\u201dAnd she finished without bidding Lian Fang Zhou goodbye. She speeded into the carriage as if she was escaping.Lian Fang Zhou wasn\u2019t bothered by her attitude. Instead, she swept up and down at Ah Jian with a strange gaze. This made Ah Jian feel uneasy. He forced a smile, \u201cWhy, why are you looking at me like that?\u201dInitially, Lian Fang Zhou wanted to ask, but when she thought about Xi Que behavior, afraid it was very likely something terrible. And she replied with, \u201cOh, its nothing much. Since you promised her, then you should quickly go.\u201d\u201cOk, I\u2019ll come back earlier and make it in time to chop more wood to char!\u201d Seeing that she wasn\u2019t going to grill him, Ah Jian sighed in relief and hurriedly nodded with a grin.Lian Fang Zhou chuckled and said. \u201cI didn\u2019t say you need to rush to work for half day. You don\u2019t need to be hasty. Just rest in the afternoon!\u201dAh Jian just smiled, didn\u2019t respond. Not long later, he went out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Saying what if he went and never came back?Not waiting for her sister to answer, Lian Fang Qing snatched to say, \u201cBrother Ah Jian isn\u2019t that kind of person! He\u2019ll definitely come back. \u201dThird Aunt continued. \u201cOh, what if it\u2019s possible? This isn\u2019t his home after all!. That hounding Zhao Family mostly likely will give him more salary than us.\u201dThen Lian Fang Zhou blandly pointed out. \u201cIf he wanted to leave like this, could we make him stay?\u201dImmediately, Third Aunt turned silent. She mumbled a bit then declared, \u201cIf it\u2019s like that, don\u2019t give him a penny from the profit of selling the charcoal.\u201dLian Fang Zhou secretly rolled her eyes and didn\u2019t say anything.Then Lian Che mentioned: \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine but what about Second Brother? He\u2019s learning martial arts from Brother Ah Jian!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m with Qing-er. I believe Brother Ah Jian will definitely come back!\u201d Lian Ze rushed to proclaim. After a pause, he continued. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t come back, what Sister said is reasonable\u2026\u201dLian Fang Zhou gave him a reassuring smile. \u201cIf you still want to learn martial arts, there\u2019s nothing to it. We\u2019ll go discuss it with him and let him teach like usual. I believe he won\u2019t refuse.\u201dLian Ze wrinkled his brow. \u201cIf it\u2019s like that, then I won\u2019t learn from him!\u201dLian Fang Zhou questioned him with a serious face, \u201cWhy?\u201dLian Ze remained quiet.Lian Fang Zhou continued on speaking. \u201cI understand your meaning. Firmly believe if he\u2019s not a genuine person, then you don\u2019t want to learn from him, right?\u201dLian Ze froze then lightly nodded.Lian Fang Zhou then said, \u201cWhen looking at people, use your heart! Don\u2019t just look at the matter on the outside. What kind of person is Ah Jian, we can already see from this period of time, right? If he wanted to stay in Zhao Family, then he must have his reason. We can\u2019t paint him black or white just based on one matter. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201dThe matter in this world, isn\u2019t completely white or black? Usually, Lian Ze\u2019s disposition is too upright. Lian Fang Zhou had long wanted to find a chance to educate him.Seeing him not respond, she then explained about how it\u2019s more convenient for Ah Jian to stay in the city to search for news on missing people. Only then Lian Ze was surprised and said. \u201cIf it\u2019s really like that\u2026then \u2026 then we can\u2019t blame him.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s great that you understand!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou beamed.After breakfast, the four siblings entered the mountain. Lian Ze and Lian Fang Zhou chopped wood for charring. Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che were also occupied. They helped to transport. In the beginning, Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t want those two to come, but they persist in following them to the mountain to play. Lian Fang Zhou could only let them be. In any case, it\u2019s up to them whether they help or play.Not long after it passed noon, Ah Jian arrived.The three of them gave a giant sigh of relief. Lian Fang Qing flew over to Ah Jian and pulled his hand as she happily cried out. \u201cBrother Ah Jian, you finally came back!\u201dAh Jian rubbed her little head with a grin and glanced at Lian Fang Zhou.Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s heart subconsciously relaxed. She nodded to him, grinning, \u201cThe matter is settled?\u201dAh Jian simply answered with \u2018mm\u2019 and nothing else was spoken.Lian Fang Zhou also didn\u2019t ask anymore. \u201cThat\u2019s great. Leaving the matter unclear, is asking for trouble after all. \u201dThe second round of charcoal was soon out of the stove. With the previous experience, they had a more accurate grasp of time this round. Not only was the yield much higher, but two days were saved.The two families were like groundhogs storing food as they chopped firewood and wood for charring non-stop. The flat spot beside the kilns was piled into a little mountain. After the charcoal in the kilns was taken out, it (i think it\u2019s referring to the kiln) was cooled for half a day then it can be refilled. The process was even quicker.This time around, the four kilns made a total of over five thousand jin of charcoal. That means eleven-twelve silver and one family can get a share of five-six silver.One haul after another, the dark gleaming charcoal was moved to the home. On everyone face was rippled with joy.Mrs. Zhao was smiling till her teeth overshadow her eyes. Her thought was on the discussion about to get two sets of clothes, buying a silver hairpin and a pair of earring for New Year\u2026That day they just came back from the mountain, Lian Li and Mrs. Qiao were at the door, calling out \u201cAnyone there?\u201d and barged right in.Lian Fang Zhou swept a glance over, it seems that they have prepared. Deep down she understood the couple was definitely waiting near the entrance so that once she was back, they\u2019ll come over.She raised her hand to comb the loose hair and stepped up to welcome with a smile pasted on. \u201cUncle and Aunt, you must have nothing to do! Please take a seat.\u201dLian Fang Zhou could guess the reason for them coming here. Since her family and Aunt Zhang\u2019s didn\u2019t hide the matter about them making charcoal\u2014actually, there\u2019s no way of hiding it.Lian Li harrumphed and sat down. Mrs. Qiao cast her a glance and also sat down. Mrs. Qiao said with displeasure. \u201cDo you place any importance to your Elder? We have come, and you didn\u2019t even give us tea!\u201dHer words had yet to finish, and Lian Che and Lian Fang Qing could be seen carrying the tea over.Lian Fang Qing pouted and rebutted. \u201cAunt, it also takes time to brew tea, no? We had no idea you were coming over otherwise it would already be prepared. What are you being so anxious that your face is fuming red for?.\u201dMrs. Qiao was now putout and sneered without speaking anymore.How was she to know that the second branch\u2019s kids would take the initiative to pour tea? She couldn\u2019t wait to point out fault, so she can grasp their shortcoming and take the opportunity to give them good teaching. And they would also have a stronger position in later discussion.Who knew it was them who revealed their shortcoming instead.\u201cYou\u2019re too problematic,\u201d obviously Lian Li recognize this fact. He threw a fierce glare at Mrs. Qiao before turning to Lian Fang Zhou with a pleasant face. \u201cYour Aunt is just frank and outspoken. You don\u2019t have to mind her.\u201dLian Fang Zhou just smiled and glanced at Mrs. Qiao. She leisurely answered with \u2018oh.\u2019Mrs. Qiao angerily gave her a fierce stare.Lian Li lifted up the teacup without any intention to drink it. He was waiting for Lian Fang Zhou to open her mouth. Waiting for Lian Fang Zhou to ask why they had come, so he can conveniently get into the topic.But Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s eyelids were slightly lowered. Don\u2019t know what she was thinking about but it was clear she had no intention to speak at all. The three younger Lian siblings and Ah Jian had already left. Third Aunt was still in the kitchen.Just sitting there won\u2019t do. Without any other choice, Lian Li lightly coughed. \u201cFang Zhou, I heard that you\u2019re working with Li Family on the charcoal business.\u201d\u201cMhmm,\u201d Lian Fang Zhou lifted her head, gave Lian Li a nod and then nothing else.Lian Li started to feel a bit angry. Irritated he said, \u201cPreviously Li Family didn\u2019t know how to make charcoal. So where could they have learned this?\u201d\u201cI also don\u2019t know!\u201dLian Fang Zhou smiled. There\u2019s no adult in their home, and Ah Jian isn\u2019t from here, so he had no footing. They could only explain to others, it was Uncle Li who learned to make charcoal from somewhere. Incidentally, he also called on the Lian siblings to help out and share the benefits. Naturally, they tell others, the profit they get also isn\u2019t a lot.Aunt Zhang often helped Lian Fang Zhou and the rest, so this time around wasn\u2019t any surprise.Seeing Lian Li getting rebuffed repeatedly, discontent emerge within Mrs. Qiao. She snorted, \u201cHow much wage does the Li family give? I say, their family is too much. They cheat you into working for them! And you siblings are stupidly working yourself to death. I\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t even earn enough to match their loose change. They are simply bullying you cause your young and not placing any importance to us Uncle and Aunt.\u201dCompletely acting as if they were standing up for them and with a stance of wanting to head to Li family to create a large scene.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We were willing to help in this matter. Each bit we earn is a bit more, as we siblings have to eat and buy clothes. And also next year in early spring, we need to buy seedlings and farming tools. All this require money, right? How about Uncle and Aunt lend us?\u201d\u201cWe have no money!\u201d immediately Mrs. Qiao responded in agitation when she wanted to borrow from them.Lian Li interrupted her, \u201cThat\u2019s not how it goes! You helped them with that much work, then you should get that much worth of money. You can\u2019t just let them brush you off with few coppers! You got thin faces, and feel that they have helped you a lot, so find it embarrassing to mention about it. They\u2019re thrilled to have someone to order around for nothing! And even if you mention it, it\u2019s useless. You don\u2019t know how much the product is sold and how the accounts are done. Don\u2019t let them cheated you later on and you guys still feel greatly indebted to them. \u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Mrs. Qiao then followed up. \u201cYou need an adult with you to keep an eye out! We are one family after all! As elders, how could we not side with you? This matter, you must count us in!\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t about who gaining from who. It\u2019s about doing the task much better, more appropriately and prevent you guys from suffering a loss without knowing. Secondly, the old Li couple won\u2019t look good when it spread around the village that they are deceiving the younger generation! What do you think, isn\u2019t what Uncle say very reasonable?\u201d Lian Li glimpsed Lian Fang Zhou.\u201cIsn\u2019t that the logic! This way it\u2019s just and honorable, and very fair to everyone!\u201d Mrs. Qiao added on. Then continued. \u201cLet\u2019s go! Come with us, and we\u2019ll go reason with Li family now!\u201dLian Fang Zhou finally understood, this pair wanted to get a share!Afraid there\u2019s more to it.This Uncle is an intelligent man. The chances are learning how to make charcoal is his final aim.Right now being able to get a share of profit isn\u2019t bad, but once they can learn how to make charcoal, the can do it for the rest of their life. Otherwise, why would those who know the skill wouldn\u2019t pass it an outsider and not let outsider watch at the side during the process?\u201cUncle! Aunt!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou apathetically remarked, \u201cJust now, I had already explained clearly. Uncle Li and Aunt Zhang aren\u2019t that kind of crooked people. And we also don\u2019t find it arduous! As to whatever go reason with them, there\u2019s need for it at all! Uncle, Aunt, please return!\u201d\u201cLook at this! What foolish word she is speaking?\u201d Lian Li turned to Mrs. Qiao. Using a tone that was laced with pity, he lamented. \u201cIt\u2019s clear they are ordered around by Li Family for nothing, and she still speaks up for them!Sigh, how old are you guys? How much experience do you have? Aren\u2019t you deceived so much that you can\u2019t tell between black and white? If we don\u2019t stand up for you, who will?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! Husband, what you said is so right!\u201d Mrs. Qiao firmly agreed.Lian Fang Zhou laughed in exasperation. She had seen shameless but never so blatantly like this before! They\u2019re really treating her like a child!\u201cOh?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou raised one brow. Asked. \u201cCould it be that Uncle thinks I\u2019m a fool? Think that us siblings are all fools?\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying!\u201d Lian Li frowned and stated. \u201cOf course you aren\u2019t fools!\u201d\u201cBut what you said just now is treating us as fools!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou sneered. \u201cWe aren\u2019t stupid. We know deep down who treat us well! If Aunt Zhang and Uncle Li didn\u2019t want to look after us sincerely, they wouldn\u2019t have let us join in the charcoal making, right? Have you ever seen anyone else does this? How about we take it outside and pick a bone with fellow villagers?\u201cWe are your elders! You dare talk to your elder like this!\u201d Mrs. Qiao screeched. \u201cNow you\u2019re calling for everyone to pick a bone!\u201d\u201cAunt, \u201d Lian Fang Zhou said in an upright tone. \u201cWhich part have I said is wrong, please point them out! If you can point one out, I\u2019ll pour tea and apologize!\u201dAt once, Mrs. Qiao was silent. She dare not say those bad words about Li Family in front of everyone.Lian Li coldly snorted. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to point out. Well, it\u2019s a waste of our good intention! Fine then! In any case, they won\u2019t appreciate it, then there\u2019s not else to say! They are willing to work for them for free, why bother ourselves with it? Good intention was treated as ill intent!\u201dLian Li stood up, gave Mrs. Qiao a glare and shouted. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving! Let\u2019s not lower ourselves to the younger generation\u2019s level!\u201dMrs. Qiao was displeased but knew that if they can\u2019t make Lian Fang Zhou change her mind, this matter had no way of continuing. She fiercely glared at her and spitted out, \u201cYou\u2019ll meet with retribution for disrespecting elder!\u201dOnly then did she follow after Lian Li.After they left, Lian Fang Zhou called in Lian Fang Qing and gave her few instructions. Lian Fang Qing nodded and turned around and went.Not long later, Lian Fang Qing came back breathing hard. Once she entered the house, she yelled, \u201cSister! Sister! You guessed right! I saw them head toward Aunt Zhang\u2019s home!\u201d\u201cThey really have the gut to do it!\u201d Lian Ze was overcome with anger. Without needing to guess, he knew what they plan to do.\u201cLet\u2019s go and check it out!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou wasn\u2019t surprised. She hurried over there with Lian Ze.You can\u2019t use ordinary people\u2019s line of thought to assess brazen people. The things they do create a new record every time!When the two siblings reached Li\u2019s home entrance, they can hear Lian Li speaking in a courteous tone: \u201c\u2026 those few kids are timid. They couldn\u2019t bring up the courage to say it, so they let us do it! Tomorrow when you head up to the mountain, call us as well! This way we can watch out for them. At such a young age, it makes people worry for them!\u201dLian Fang Zhou\u2019s and Lian Ze\u2019s face was colored with rage. They both full-throat called out \u2018 Uncle! Aunt!\u2019 and stepped in.By sheer coincidence, all of the Li Family breathed out in relief.Needless to say, they were aware of the relationship between the two branches of Lian Family. But no matter, Lian Li and Mrs. Qiao still have the identity of their elders. And also, this charcoal-making skill was learnt from Ah Jian, and he also lives at Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s place. If Lian Li and Mrs. Qiao insist on tagging along, as honest peasants, they have no standing to say no.\u201cWhy did you come! Shoo, shoo. there\u2019s no place for you kids to talk when adults are discussing!\u201d Mrs. Qiao immediately pulled a long face when she saw Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze and bawled with real elder bearing.On the other hand, Lian Li took the chance to bring the topic to an end. \u201cThen that\u2019s settled! We\u2019ll be leaving first!\u201dWith this, the matter count as set in stone! Lian Li gratefully praised the Lian siblings\u2019 perfect timing in his mind, \u2018Wonderful!\u2018Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t let them have their way. She walked over and stopped them with her arms wide. With a sardonic smile, she questioned \u201cUncle, Aunt, we haven\u2019t finished talking about this matter, so how could you leave?\u201dLian Li never expected Lian Fang Zhou to speak to him like this in someone else\u2019s home. His expression turned unpleasant. In a disgruntled tone, he berated, \u201cWhat are you doing! No sense of decorum at all!\u201d\u201cStill not making way! You child have no elders in your eye! Our Lian Family\u2019s face lost all it glow because of you!\u201d Mrs. Qiao scoldedAs they spoke, they planned to barge through, but Lian Ze had taken one step ahead to shut the door firmly and guarded it.Lian Fang Zhou gave Mrs. Qiao a glance first, declaring. \u201cAunt, my parents are gone, and I\u2019m the head of the second branch. So I\u2019m not just some kid. Don\u2019t use that kind of tone talking to me. It strangely uncomfortable to my ear!\u201dThen turning to Lian Li, \u201cWhy is Uncle so anxious to leave? Is it because you\u2019re feeling afraid or conscience-stricken?\u201dMrs. Zhao lit up at the sound of this. She rushed to input. \u201cFang Zhou, your Uncle just said he wants to join in on making charcoal tomorrow and that it was your intention! It\u2019s perfect that you\u2019re here. I can ask for your thoughts.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How could she not speak out when the opportunity was right in front of her?At once, Lian Li felt guilty. He wanted to pressurize the Lian siblings with his demeanor. With a cruel glare, he warned. \u201cFang Zhou, we\u2019re in an outsider home, so you should have the sense on what you can say and what you can\u2019t! Think carefully on who you will be relying on in future!\u201dLian Fang Zhou openly declared. \u201cUncle, I had always thought it through! In the future, I won\u2019t rely on anyone else, but ourselves. Is what Zhao Sao-zi said just now true? Why is it that I don\u2019t remember ever I said those words to Uncle ?\u201dLian Li\u2019s old face immediately flushed. \u201cAlthough you didn\u2019t exactly say it like that, I did hear it was this meaning.\u201dMrs. Qiao quickly nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s right! You can\u2019t possibly be thinking of denying you ever said that!\u201dLian Fang Zhou countered, \u201cThen it was you who misinterpreted my words. That was never my meaning! That is Uncle Li\u2019s trade, how could I simply let someone join? Within this region, you won\u2019t find anyone else do this. If Uncle Li hadn\u2019t had the heart to take care of us and consider how we\u2019re still so young, he wouldn\u2019t have let us join in. It couldn\u2019t be that Uncle came running over here in hope to steal their trade?\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense are you saying! I had no such thoughts!\u201d Being exposed in front of other out of nowhere by Lian Fang Zhou, immediately Lian Li was enraged from the embarrassment.\u201cOh, then I might have misinterpreted your meaning. I knew Uncle wouldn\u2019t have this intention.\u201dLian Fang Zhou gave a cold smile. And slightly bent down. \u201d I must apologize Uncle.\u201dMrs. Qiao criticized. \u201cThe Li hadn\u2019t said anything yet, so why are jumping in and making a racket? I have never seen anyone as brazen as you.\u201dMrs. Zhao quickly intervened \u201cYour Uncle said when the time comes, they can take good care of you.\u201dLian Fang Zhou ignored Mrs. Qiao, turned to say to Uncle Li politely. \u201d Uncle Li, we don\u2019t need looking after, we\u2019re not that fragile. You obtained this skill, so how it should be is how it should be. You and Aunt Zhang had always taken care of us. And we know that very well deep down. If you felt like you can\u2019t look at us in the eye because of this, then we\u2019re at fault!\u201dHow could Uncle Li not understand now. To Lian Li, he graciously expressed. \u201cSo it was all a misunderstanding! This, haha, it\u2019s great that it\u2019s clear up. Rest assured; we\u2019ll watch over Lian Fang Zhou and the others. I won\u2019t overwork them! After all, we\u2019re from the same neighborhood\u2026\u201dWith Uncle Li\u2019s words, it gave the Lian couple a stage to step off. They can\u2019t let their relationship become extremely strain since the couple is the siblings\u2019 elders after all.However, Mrs. Qiao wasn\u2019t appreciative. Instead, she agitatedly mentioned. \u201cJust now we had agreed. Brother Li, how could you do this? This isn\u2019t moral!\u201dMrs. Zhao was infuriated and couldn\u2019t resist rebutting. \u201cAunt Qiao, when did my father ever promise anything? It was you who done all the talking! With much difficulty, we finally learn this trade, how could we simply let anyone watch?\u201d\u201cMei-zi!\u201d Aunt Zhang lightly admonished Mrs. Zhao a bit. Turning to Mrs. Qiao, she gave an apologetic smile. \u201cThis daughter-in-law of mine has a loose tongue. So what she says isn\u2019t pleasing to hear. Don\u2019t be mad, her Aunt!\u201dEven though it\u2019s unpleasing to the ear, it wasn\u2019t incorrect.\u201cSince they aren\u2019t appreciative, then treat it as us worry over nothing. Let\u2019s go and not seek more hatred by staying here. Younger generation not acting like one. Oh, my pitiful brother gone so early. And perfectly fine children became like this!\u201d Lian Li heavily sighed as he grumbled. Before he left he didn\u2019t forget to step on Lian Fang Zhou as well as dragging Uncle Li and Aunt Zhang in.\u201cIn the future, don\u2019t ask me to stand up for you when you suffer! Even if you beg on your knees, I won\u2019t help!\u201d Mrs. Qiao shot the two siblings a venomous glare and also left.Uncle Li, Aunt Zhang and Li San Ge looked at each other. Mrs. Zhao lightly spat and muttered. \u201cWhat kind of person is that!\u201dSeeing Aunt Zhang shooting a warning gaze over, she unyieldingly uttered: \u201cMother, even if you look at me like that, I\u2019ll still say it!\u201dThese words made Lian Fang Zhou amused, and the atmosphere lighten up.\u201cIt\u2019s my fault. I never thought they would stir up trouble to this extent and didn\u2019t give uncle and aunt a head up.\u201dLian Fang Zhou apologetically smile.\u201cNo need to say this kind of words!\u201d Aunt Zhang grasped her hand with a reassuring smile. She lightly sighed, \u201cOh, this really is\u2026\u201dIn the end, Uncle Li felt terrible, and suggested, \u201cAll in all, they are your elders. How about\u2026 we count them in in this matter?\u201d\u201cUncle Li! You mustn\u2019t say that!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou shook her head. She firmly stated \u201cYou guys know it very well, so I\u2019m not afraid to talk about my family\u2019s messy situation. What kind of person are my Uncle and Aunt? They had never helped us a single bit. If we must say, they are the ones who participated the most in bullying us orphans. If we endure and give way this time, they would only become more arrogant, and in future, they might demand more and more. And also, their life isn\u2019t so terrible that need money to avert a crisis.\u201dAunt Zhang lightly sighed again, \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult on you.\u201dLian Fang Zhou faintly smiled, \u201cDifficult? Not relying on them, we can still have a good life. There\u2019s a limit to their seeking trouble tendency. When forced too much to a corner, it\u2019ll spread out, and see how shameless they are as elders.\u201d\u201cAnyhow you\u2019re all one family! If you can, then don\u2019t take that step unless there\u2019s no other choice!\u201d Aunt Zhang swiftly advised.Lian Ze reasoned, \u201cAunt Zhang, when did they ever treat us their family! Before when my parents were still alive, they took out an older brother attitude and made my parents help with their work from time to time. Now it\u2019s just us, if they could take advantage of us, they won\u2019t be polite about it.\u201dAunt Zhang then replied. \u201cOn normal matters, you should endure. If you can\u2019t, then you need a justified reason. Or else when it spread out, it won\u2019t be good since they are your elders after all! Then, in the end, you\u2019ll suffer a loss. Other matters is fine, but it\u2019ll be terrible when someone ruins your reputation. Your younger siblings\u2019 marriage will be affected in the future. And also Che-er, didn\u2019t you say you plan to send him to school?\u201dAt once Lian Fang Zhou felt a moment of helplessness. Ancient time is really troublesome. At the same time, she secretly became more vigilant: she not from here, what if she slipped up when she wasn\u2019t paying attention?She the obediently nodded, \u201cI\u2019ll remember! Thank you for the reminder, Aunt Zhang!\u201dLian Ze also agreed and gave thanks.Uncle Li solemnly asserted. \u201cAlright, this matter count as settled! I understood your meaning in this matter, and won\u2019t budge on it anymore.\u201d\u201cI have troubled you a lot!\u201dLian Fang Zhou gratefully smiledUncle Li dismissively waved his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing! If you weren\u2019t thinking of us, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to earn this money! In future, if you ever need something, freely ask. No need to be shy.\u201dLian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze promised and spoke a bit more small talks before they left.Once the two of them, Third Aunt came forward to probe for information. Lian Fang Zhou just answered \u2018It\u2019s fine now\u2019 and nothing more. She also informed them all to stay away from the couple if possible. So they can avoid getting schemed by them.Lian Fang Qing is mischievous, while Lian Che who was the same age, was completely steady and full of self-control. Lian Fang Zhou instructed Lian Che, \u201cKeep a good eye on your fourth sister!\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Lian Che promised. Lian Fang Qing eyes innocently blinked as she pulled a face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This time all the freshly made charcoal were placed in Li Family\u2019s storage shed. They plan to sell them after a while. While the weather is good, everyone used the time they had to make more.One day, Lian Fang Zhou bumped into Zhang\u00a0Li Zheng1\u2018s wife, Mrs. Niu on the road. Lian Fang Zhou warmly greeted her. Mrs. Niu returned with a smile, and as passing, she mentioned about her and Li Family\u2019s charcoal business. Her words were underlined with absolute envy and also carried a bit of hidden tartness.This Mrs. Niu considered herself mighty, and what\u2019s more, she got a trait of loving small gain. Relying on her status as the village official\u2019s wife, she benefited a lot from others. At most, it\u2019s just some garlic and scallion or a trivial matter snatching to receive gains first. Because of Li Zheng\u2019s face, everyone just grumbled a bit behind her back. No one would hold a grudge against her.In response to her words, Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s mind began turning. Somewhat sheepishly, she confessed. \u201cTo tell you the truth, Uncle Li and Aunt Zhang saw that we\u2019re pitiful, so they supported us out a bit. How much strength could we have? We can\u2019t call it a partnership! However, we did bring home a good bit of broken charcoal chunks that aren\u2019t worth much. If Aunt Niu doesn\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll send some down to you later on. It\u2019s still good charcoal, and you can use it for the stove in the winter time.\u201dMrs. Niu\u2019s face blossomed into a giant grin straight away. Her eyes shone as her mouth joyously uttered, \u201cOh my, how could I possibly take it? Charcoal chunks are still charcoal. You can still use it as normal. \u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a lot! We can\u2019t use it all anyway. In any case, we still need to give it away, so giving it to anyone is still giving away.\u201d Lian Fang Zhou decided. \u201cLater in the afternoon, I\u2019ll send some down to your home!\u201d\u201cHoho, look at you lass, you\u2019re becoming smooth-spoken! Since you said it like this, what else can I say!\u201d Mrs. Niu eyes twinkled but then contemplated. \u201cI\u2019m afraid there\u2019s nobody home in the afternoon. How about this, send them over after dinner.\u201dMrs. Niu grandson just turned six months, so how could there be no one home? The nogs in Lian Fang Zhou head turned. Then she understood Mrs. Niu\u2019s misgiving. Her family is parentless, so Mrs. Niu is afraid of others speaking poorly of her for taking their stuff. This is a roundabout way of hinting her to go over in the dark.Currently, the weather isn\u2019t like summer, so people don\u2019t out much in the evening.\u201cAlright,\u201d she outright agreed. \u201cAfter dinner, I still need to wash some dish and tidy up the house. So I might be much later.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine! We head to bed pretty late! Our little grandson is very colicky.\u201d Mrs. Niu became even more delighted hearing the words that match her desire.Lian Fang Zhou followed up her words with praises for her grandson. This made Mrs. Niu so overjoyed that flowers bloomed around her.Li Zheng is neither small or big position, but it is the one in control at the moment. So there\u2019s no disadvantage in having a better relationship with them.Just like Aunt Zhang said, Lian Li and Mrs. Qiao are elders after all. With that kind of personality, who knows what they would do in the future.When the time comes, they might need to ask for justice from Li Zheng.She doesn\u2019t hope for him to be partial, but at least being reasonable is enough for her.These matters, she must plan while she can.When she returned home, she brought Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che with her to the attic. They pack some good charcoal chunks that were piled there into a sack, so it was ready to be taken over to Mrs. Niu\u2019s.Even though it was called broken charcoal chunks, it wasn\u2019t broken pieces. Compare to the one-meter long charcoal; they were obviously bits and bobs. Some were two fingers long, some were around one finger long, and some were also split into halves. It\u2019s unavoidable to have broken chunks like these in each patch of charcoal. Those that can\u2019t be sold were brought home to use.When Mrs. Niu saw that Lian Fang Zhou actually came, she felt completely satisfied on the inside and received it with a beaming grin. She also lamented how it wasn\u2019t easy for the siblings. And also mentioned if they ever need help, ask!These were courtesy words. But with Mrs. Niu, it\u2019s most likely that she was afraid that she got request and decided to test the water. Without saying, Lian Fang Zhou just politely gave thanks and didn\u2019t make any demand. After some small talks, she left.Zhang Li Zheng observed his wife glowing with joy as she carried a sack of something into the house and questioned. \u201cWho was it just now? Why did they leave before even coming in? What is that? Did you ask for something from others again?\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying!\u201d Mrs. Niu glared at Zhang Li Zheng. Full of displeasure, she rebutted. \u201cWhat with \u2018I ask for something from others again\u2019? Oh, take a look! It\u2019s just some worthless charcoal pieces! I have to say; it\u2019s so sweet of that child, Fang Zhou. She knew that our family needs to dry our grandson\u2019s nappies every day, so she sent over some charcoal chunks. Anyway, this thing doesn\u2019t cost her anything, so why can\u2019t I accept them?\u201dWith this, Zhang Li Zheng didn\u2019t say anything. He also dotes on their grandson.Right now, it\u2019s the beginning of winter. Every day the sun rises as usual however despite it being brighter than summer, it doesn\u2019t have the warmth.And Li Zheng\u2019s grandson needed to change at least around a dozen of nappies each day. They can only use charcoal fire to dry them.Last winter, they had some charcoal left over. But they became damp since they had left it at a random corner. Now when they use it, it would make a horrid, choking smell and fill the house with that scent.It\u2019s a stroke of good luck that Lian Fang Zhou sent some charcoal chunk now. This act makes one\u2019s heart feel moved.\u201cOh fine then, since she seldom shows her consideration. But if it was other things, you can\u2019t just take! After all, \u201d Zhang Li Zheng paused a moment. \u201d they are different from other families!\u201dTheir family consisted of orphans. Accepting their things is asking to be spoken poorly.\u201cI know! I still have a sense of moderation, no?\u201d Mrs. Niu rolled her eyes. \u201cThey are working with Li Da Mu\u2019s family in making charcoal. I don\u2019t know how much profit they get, but they have access to an endless amount of these charcoal pieces! While ours here isn\u2019t that much!\u201dWith an approving tone, she commented as she sighed. \u201cOh, I had never noticed before, that lass, Fang Zhou is so warm-hearted and so agreeable. She and her siblings are quite pitiful. In the future, if we can speak a few words for them, then let\u2019s help them! It can count as accumulating blessing for our grandson!\u201dZhang Li Zheng gave her a withering glance and stated. \u201cThat goes without saying, do you even need to say it? I didn\u2019t become the Li Zheng for no reason!\u201dEarly one day, Zhang Li Zheng\u2019s youngest daughter, Zhang Yan came over to Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s home. In a benevolent smile, she passed on a message. \u201cSister Fang Zhou, you must come back from work early today. Best to be back when the sun is starting to set. My father said that every household must have a decision-maker go to the big camphor tree for a discussion! There\u2019s an urgent matter to be announced!\u201dLian Fang Zhou quickly acknowledged.Zhang Yan also mentioned that she still need to notify other families and left.Lian Ze shot a glance at Zhang Yan who was leaving. And remarked, \u201d It\u2019s strange. Usually, when there\u2019s an announcement in the village, Li Zheng would only tell Uncle and not us. This year we had nearly missing tax payment. Thank god Aunt Zhang reminded us. Can\u2019t believe Zhang Yan would come knocking today!\u201dLian Fang Zhou\u2019s mind turned and then realized it was most likely the perk of that big sack of charcoal. And cheerful spoke, \u201cIsn\u2019t this a good thing? This means they aren\u2019t treating us as nothing!\u201d\u201cSister is right!\u201d Lian Ze chuckled.\u201cDiscussion? This is so sudden, what matter is there? oh\u201dThird Aunt sighed at the side.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In Da Fang village, the appointed spot was under the camphor tree in the middle of the village. For example, in the spring planting time, he would give a reminder to quickly sow the seed in order not to miss the period. In autumn, a caution against fire hazard in the dry season; or announce when to hand in tax after harvest season. Also when the imperial court is in need of soldiers and other corvee matters like that. It\u2019s all announced by the Li Zheng.However, matters like recruiting soldiers and corvee rarely happen. Usually, it\u2019s about the spring planting or harvest matters. To have an announcement at this time and an urgent one as well, one can\u2019t help but worry. No wonder that Third Aunt is sighing here and there.Lian Fang Zhou declared. \u201cLet it be! When the time comes, we\u2019ll know. Our family consists of half-grown children so we might not get affected.\u201dThird Aunt pondered about it and felt that her words make sense. So she didn\u2019t bother with it anymore.As soon as evening came, Lian Fang Zhou, Lian Ze and the Li couple returned first. They have done a simple clean up, and as prearranged, they headed the giant camphor tree together.When they arrived, there were already villagers scattered around the camphor tree. Everyone was in a group of two or three, discussing something.It was clear, that Li Zheng\u2019s lip was tight. Even till the last second, nobody knew what was happening. These discussion and guessing were just to pass the time.More and more people gathered. It had already become tightly packed in the area. Lian Li and Mrs. Qiao had also arrived. When they saw that the Lian siblings had come with the Li couple, one remained silent, and the other spat on the ground as she criticized them. Afterward, she didn\u2019t bother looking at them anymore.Not long later, Zhang Li Zheng had arrived and stood on the high stone platform under the camphor tree. He swept a gaze around, on the top of his vocal cord, he asked a few times, \u201cIs everyone here?\u201dEveryone answered over each other, \u201cWe\u2019re all here! Quickly tell us!\u201dZhang Li Zheng cleared his throat, loudly called out, \u201cEveryone, quiet down. Quiet down for a bit and listen to me!\u201dAfter a few rounds of yelling did everyone become silent and they all focus their eyes on Zhang Li Zheng.Then Zhang Li Zheng slowly announced, \u201d The county hall had just passed down a notice. The state has two new seedlings to pass out that everyone is required to try growing next year\u2013\u201dHe had yet to finish before below broke out into chaos.\u201cWhat! New seedlings? Are they reliable?\u201d\u201cTry growing? Using our own land?\u201d\u201cWaste of saliva! If not using your own land, then where are you going to plant them?\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t do! What will happen to the crops? If we don\u2019t plant crops, we going to starve next year!\u201d\u201cI agree. Now they are forcing us to grow some unknown thing and when the time comes, will the officials care about us being starved?\u201d\u201cYou must be dreaming. Which officials ever care about us common people\u2019s life or death!\u201d\u201cOh, please don\u2019t argue yet! Quiet down the noise first. We haven\u2019t heard what Zhang Li Zheng have to say.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dZhang Li Zheng wasn\u2019t anxious when the crowd broke into chaos. As if he knew everyone would react like this. He stood there and watched silently with steady composure.\u201cOh, why did this happen out of nowhere!? This unknown seed, can it be better than grain? Oh my!\u201d Aunt Zhang deeply sighed.\u201cWhat else can we do? The official has passed down the words, we can\u2019t disobey, right?\u201d Uncle Li is an honest man. Giving it some more thoughts, he continued, \u201cAt most, we\u2019ll just make a few more charcoal and save some more money. So when the time comes, we can buy grains. We won\u2019t starve.\u201dAt his reasonable words, Aunt Zhang nodded and let go of her anxiety and dilemma.But she did feel a bit depressed because she initially thought this year they can have a prosperous New Year and get a lot more stuff. But now, they\u2019ll have to come up with a new plan.Lian Fang Zhou gave a slight encouraging smile, \u201cUncle Li, Aunt Zhang, let\u2019s listen so more first. There\u2019s a chance it might be a good matter!\u201dUncle Li and Aunt Zhang gave a grim laugh. They both have the same thought.Is there ever a good matter from the official? If there is, it would have already snatched by someone else and not become like this!Seeing everyone chattered enough, Zhang Li Zheng loudly called for everyone to quiet down again. He continued on, \u201cWell, these two things, one is called potato, and the other is called cotton. Potato can be eaten like grains. As for cotton, it can be used to made clothes\u2026\u201dReaching to this part, below exploded into chaos again.Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s mind also exploded. She immediately shot her head toward Zhang Li Zheng and tried to control her agitation.Potato! Cotton! These are stuff with great value!But, no matter how good things are, people need to know its benefits for it to become good things! To those who never seen it, they have other thoughts about it.For instance, the crowd of country folks here is reacting extremely angrily.\u201cI have farmed my whole and have never heard of a\u00a0bean1growing in the soil! Who are you trying to hoodwink? Why not just call it peanut!\u201d\u201cIt definitely can\u2019t compare to peanut. So it can\u2019t even match up to that name!\u201d\u201cThat\u00a0cotton2thing is even worst. Flowers can be turned into clothes! Why not just wear leaves then!\u201dThe crowd burst into a wave of mocking laughter. After the laughter died, they were even moodier and furious.They all have the same thought:the officials are going too far! They clearly want the farmers\u2019 life.\u201cSister, don\u2019t worry! We can make some more charcoal with Uncle Li. And also next year, I can enter the mountain to hunt!\u201d Lian Ze assumed Lian Fang Zhou was drowning in worry and hurried to comfort her in a small voice.\u201cSister is fine! You don\u2019t have to worry!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou gave him a faint smile.The amount of rejection and rage from everyone was well over Zhang Li Zheng\u2019s expectation. Zhang Li Zheng was also losing his patience and loudly yelled. \u201cQuiet down everyone! Listen to me! What use is there to your ruckus? You think after complaining you don\u2019t have to get the seed?\u201dHis words were undoubtedly the truth. So at his words and Zhang Li Zheng\u2019s wrath, they all depressingly closed their mouth.\u201cZhang Li Zheng, you must think of a solution for everyone! It can\u2019t be this way! Next year, my family of old and young would starve!\u201d Someone pleaded with a bitter face. This obtained everyone else\u2019s support.\u201cHow could I not know your difficulties!\u201d Zhang Li Zheng then let out a long sigh. \u201cBut this is the imperial court\u2019s decision. The three southwest provinces had to choose three counties each to experiment the new seeds. Our Yu He County is one of them. What else can we say? You come to me for an idea, then who do I turn to? Aren\u2019t I still in the same position as you? I must also grow them! No one can avoid planting them. Alright then, when you get pressed charged against and get sent to the\u00a0Yamen3, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you!\u201dOnce Zhang Li Zheng declared this, they all became so quiet that a pin drop could be heard and drooped down their head with a frown locked in place.\u201cZhang Li Zheng, It can\u2019t be that every household must plant all their field with these things?\u201d Someone questioned.Everyone\u2019s mood surged up as their head all swoop up toward Zhang Li Zheng at the same time.Since we can\u2019t escape from it, then we\u2019ll plant them. But at least let us plant grains in the leftover field!Zhang Li Zheng\u2019s expression loosened when he saw everyone firmly within grasp. \u201cThe official did have everyone in their mind, so how could they possibly do that? Each household only needs to plant one half of the field with potato and cotton. The rest, you can plant whatever you want! The potato seed is two wen per one jin, and cottonseed is five wen per one jin!\u201d\u201cWhat!

In reproaching manner, he spoke. \u201cThe seeds didn\u2019t just drop from the sky. So how could it not cost money? It\u2019s already at a low price! And also, when the harvest season arrives, these harvest tax would be half equal to half of the crop harvest tax. This also counts as the imperial court being generous.\u201dWhen hearing that it cost money, everyone burst into a discussion. Now understanding the tax was halved, instead of being delighted, they became even more distressed. Distress is no small matter.Think about it. Why would the imperial court collect less tax?\u201cZhang Li Zheng, if there\u2019s someone who is willing to help others grow the plants, is it allowed?\u201d Lian Fang Zho raised her voice to shout out her question.In the midst of the crowd, someone made a mocking sound which was then followed by laughter as he looked at Lian Fang Zhou with full of ridicule. In his mind, he wondered if the Lian Family\u2019s eldest has lost her mind. Who would actually be willing to help others grow these things? It\u2019s more likely that they would wish to throw all this onto someone else\u2019s shoulder!Zhang Li Zheng was also taken by surprise. After a moment of consideration, he nodded. \u201cThere\u2019s no problem as long as both parties are willing!\u201d\u201cOk!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou acknowledged. And continued questioning. \u201cThen did the imperial court send anyone down to give guidance on how to grow these?\u201d\u201cNone!\u201d Zhang Li Zheng replied. \u201d It\u2019s just growing plants. Which farmer doesn\u2019t know how to? So there\u2019s no need for the imperial court to do something as troublesome as sending someone down to give pointers!\u201dLian Fang Zhou showed an expression as if it just dawned on her and no longer spoke.Actually, the truth is that the imperial court did plan to send someone to give pointers since these plants are rare and not many know how to grow them. However, the Southwest Governor took the initiative to handle this project to curry favor with the Crown Prince. And to show off his citizen\u2019s talents, he refused to let the imperial court send someone over. Isn\u2019t it just farming? The new plants are also plants. Just scatter it on the ground, give some care, and water and it\u2019ll be grand!And on top of that, it\u2019s just a trial project. If it didn\u2019t succeed, then he would have reasons to justify like unsuitable environment, inappropriate weather and the likes.So rewording it, when unsuccessful, show a positive and sincere attitude. And if it\u2019s successful, then he would gain great merit!\u201cAlright! Alright! This matter is settled then! Later, don\u2019t forget to come over to my place to collect the seeds! Don\u2019t forget okay!\u201d Zhang Li Zheng finished up and waved his hand toward below. \u201cYou can disperse now!\u201dEveryone started left while discussing.\u201cOnly she could possibly do it. To ask such stupid questions; complete utter nonsense! Can\u2019t believe she\u2019s not afraid of being mocked!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou heard Mrs. Qiao prattled on nearby in a disgruntled tone.She and Lian Ze exchanged a glance and directed a faint smile at Lian Ze. They left together without bothering with Mrs. Qiao.Gradually they have gone far, and nobody else was around, Aunt Zhang reassuringly told Lian Fang Zhou, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about this matter yet. In a few days, we\u2019ll watch how the other guys handle it first, then we\u2019ll follow!\u201dLian Fang Zhou halted for a second. She wasn\u2019t able to catch on her meaning, but she did understand Aunt Zhang would never harm them, so she obediently nodded for now. Then they parted way.Only then did Lian Ze spoke up. \u201cSister, Aunt Zhang is right. Though Zhang Li Zheng explained it very serious just now, he also has his own headache. Not many people would willingly take the initiative to go collect the seeds! So we\u2019ll just sit and watch for now. If everyone doesn\u2019t collect it, then we\u2019ll do the same!\u201dThis is \u2026[law can\u2019t hold everyone responsible][https://dict.naver.com/linedict/zhendict/dict.html#/cnen/entry/4148e6bc53d84bae945f0659a7953d91]?After a short contemplation, Lian Fang Zhou was at ease. It\u2019s not like other matters. This matter means taking up everyone\u2019s field! It\u2019s a matter that is close to taking their life, so who wouldn\u2019t go against it if they can.However, this also clearly says her opportunity has come! After all, she didn\u2019t ask those few questions for no reason.Others might not know what potatoes and cotton are, but she knows. These are useful stuff!Leaving potato aside, as long as they have grown one batch, they can make high-quality cotton cloth and cotton gauze. Just using these to make clothes and quilt, they can earn a fortune!There\u2019s more to sowing the cotton into the soil and looking after it diligently. The most critical part is handling the topsoil. If they didn\u2019t know about it, most farmers wouldn\u2019t think about doing this.Apart from this, it is also very particular on how to care for it during the planting period, when is the best time to pick the cotton and the handling of it after it was plucked.Lian Fang Zhou returned home in high spirit. But it gradually died down and became somewhat disheartened.The reason for this is lack of money.Such a hard to come by opportunity. And she was confident that that next year everyone will find out about cotton\u2019s benefit. And at that time what can she use to contest those rich people? She must grab the first-mover opportunity!With just first-mover opportunity, seeds and skills, it\u2019s still not enough. The most essential components are land and human resources.And money is needed to buy land and hire labor force.In her opinion, hiring people isn\u2019t very safe. The best method is to buy few honest and capable ones from the slave trader. This way she can prevent the skills from being stolen away.However, this means there\u2019s more mouth to feed and need more space to shelter\u2026Without adding up the expenses, she wouldn\u2019t have known how shocking the cost is.Anyway, Lian Fang Zhou understood that no matter how much they diligently sell charcoal, they won\u2019t be able to gather enough fund.Lian Fang Zhou gave a long gentle sigh. Should she give up? But she was unwilling as once she passes this point, she can\u2019t turn back!There\u2019s only one opportunity!Initially, she wanted to try borrowing money. But now thinking about, she can only cast aside this idea.Nobody would be willing to lend over hundred thousand silver to her. As for mortgaging\u2026 Her family condition is like this, so there\u2019s nothing to put on the stake.What about trying to partner with someone? Within this region, only Shang village\u2019s landlord, Zhu Manor\u2019s Official[Yuan Wai- second only to the Assistant Minister] Zhu, Shi Wan\u2019s wealthy Mr. Li, and our village\u2019s Official Wang.Lian Fang Zhou knows her hopes are uncertain, but she definitely doesn\u2019t want to lose this once in a million chance. So even with the slightest possibility, she wants to give it a try.The outcome was terrible. When these officials and the rich man are polite, they tactfully refuse. If not, they had outright shooed away before she even get a chance to speak and some didn\u2019t meet her.All of them without exception, looked at her like she was some fool and wondered if the Lian Family\u2019s eldest has gone mad.Lian Fang Zhou had also gone to the town\u2019s Zhao Family to seek for Zhao Ru Jun. In her opinion, Zhao Ru Jun must be a genius to be able to handle the family business without breaking a sweat. Chances are she could be different from the others!Unfortunately, she wasn\u2019t able to meet Zhao Ru Jun. At the time, Xi Que caught a glimpse of her when she arrived. Xi Que halted the gatekeeper who was going to report to Young Miss and ordered the gatekeeper to send her out. She also spat toward the retreating figure. \u201cWhat do you think you are? She should take a look at a mirror. With just her, she dares to come here to seek Young Miss boldly! Our Young Miss isn\u2019t someone she wants to meet just because she wants to. Utterly without shame!\u201dWithout any other ideas, Lian Fang Zhou could only use what money at hand for this matter.She briefly calculated. This winter\u2019s charcoal earned sixty-seventy liang, the leftover of Yang Family\u2019s dissolving engagement compensation was around ten liang and from selling mushrooms came up to ten liang. Meaning it adds up to around ninety liang.Leaving thirty liang aside for all of next year\u2019s expenses and Lian Che\u2019s study use, only sixty liang could be used.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 67": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Picking Up a General to Plow the FieldsChapter 66Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMaggie_With the sixty liang, she can use it to buy land. An ordinary one is four liang per mu[mu, a traditional unit of area(1 mu=0.0667 hectare)]. So, they can buy fifteen mu, and all these are just for planting cotton! Although it is a difference from her original plan, she could only make do with this for now.Next year, the whole family will have to suffer a bit. After that, they will be much better off.When Lian Fang Zhou said she wants to put all of the money, including the earning that they have yet to receive from charcoal, to buy land to grow cotton, the whole family was shocked.Third Aunt was the first to object. Full of anger and agitation, she spoke, \u201cFang Zhou, don\u2019t be silly! Everyone has been deliberating over this matter these few days. They wish to avoid it as much as possible, and none would step forward. If it were a worthwhile matter, the government would have already passed it to those big landlords and influential squire. How could us ordinary citizen have a chance? Hmph, I heard those wealthy landlords had already gone to negotiate with the county council. Some already planned to throw away the seeds through selling and pay the tax like usual during harvest, while others didn\u2019t even bother with selling. Hmph, the governments are just bullying us, ordinary citizens. Who told us not to have money or connections. Buying lands isn\u2019t a bad idea, but you can\u2019t plant whatever flower! How could flower possibly turn to clothes to wear! What a joke, are they treating people as a fool!\u201d\u201cSister, Third Aunt\u2019s words are reasonable. So why do you want to grow cotton?\u201d Lian Ze questioned.Lian Che and Lian Fang Qing were still young, so they only silently watch at the sideline.Lian Fang Zhou responded, \u201cI want to give it a try. I have a feeling that the government isn\u2019t trying to trick people! This isn\u2019t a small matter! Look how many common people have been dragged in, aren\u2019t they afraid of causing chaos? As for cotton can make clothes, even if they want to fool people they won\u2019t use this kind of lie, no? I believe its the truth. Hemp could be spun into yarn and turned into cloth. If you just look at the field of hemp, you can\u2019t connect it to cloth, right? Let\u2019s give it a try! Anyway, we need to buy the land and if we been fooled next year, then the year after we won\u2019t grow them anymore. The only problem is that we\u2019ll be poorly off next year.\u201dAs always, Lian Ze complied to his sister, and readily agreed. \u201cI can see the logic in Sister\u2019s words. It won\u2019t hurt to give it a go. And also next year, when the weather is warm, we can go to Mount Xian Teng to pick mushrooms to sell! I can also go hunt! Big Brother Ah Jian said there\u2019s no time now with the charcoal business. When we have more free time, he\u2019ll take me to Mount Xian Teng.\u201d\u201cI heard that Mount Xian Teng was a bountiful place and want to go see for myself!\u201d Ah Jian gave a faint laugh and explained. As to the cotton matter, he has no opinion as he isn\u2019t part of the family.\u201cWho\u2019s talking about that!\u201d Third Aunt anxiously persuaded Lian Fang Zhou with all her might, but Lian Fang Zhou had settled on this plan and wouldn\u2019t change her mind. Lian Ze also supported her. At the end of her wits, Third Aunt pointed out, \u201cEven if you want that many cotton plant, have you thought of the number of seeds? There aren\u2019t that many seeds!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s simple! Look for Li Zheng, since there are so many people who don\u2019t want to plant them!\u201d Lian Che answered. \u201cOur sister did send charcoal to Li Zheng Uncle, so Li Zheng Uncle will definitely help!\u201d\u201cOh, you rugrat!\u201d Third Aunt shot him a pointed glare at his words.Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s eyes flashed and rushed to ask, \u201cHow did you know I sent charcoal to Li Zheng\u2019s home?\u201dAlthough that day she had brought the two little one with her to pack the charcoal, she hasn\u2019t told them it was for Mrs. Niu. There was no need to announce it everywhere as she only needed Mrs. Niu to remember her good point.As well as that, if announced, it would turn bad instead. After all, her family consisted of orphans!\u201cI know! I know!\u201d Lian Fang Qing snatched to say. \u201cIt was Zhang Yan who told someone else!\u201dZhang Yan? Li Zheng\u2019s daughter? Lian Fang Zhou paused. Then there\u2019s nothing she can do about it.After some contemplation, she instructed, \u201cQing-er, Che-er, in a bit pick a basketful of charcoal to send over to Uncle and Aunt!\u201d\u201cWhy? I don\u2019t want to!\u201d Lian Fang Qing pouted. Lian Che also disagreed.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Our family had collected that many charcoal pieces back. It\u2019s more than enough for this winter. So it doesn\u2019t matter if we send down some to them! Be good! Lian Fang Zhou gently coaxed.\u201cI understand, Sister! In a while, I\u2019ll pack some with fourth sis!\u201d Lian Che yielded.Lian Fang Qing kept pouting and no longer spoke.\u201cYou being so generous!\u201d Third Aunt glowered at Lian Fang Zhou. As she was about to follow up with more, it came to her. Is Lian Fang Zou purposely changing the topic by giving this order? Third Aunt then threw away her currents stream of thoughts and continued moaning. \u201cFang Zhou ah, you really can\u2019t step up on the cotton matter! What if it failed? You\u2019ll waste the field and the money and also get laughed at by others! How about just trying with the amount requested and if it succeeds, then you can plant more the year after!\u201dHer words sounded practical. Lian Ze enquiringly turned to Lian Fang Zhou. If Lian Fang Zhou insist on doing that, he would also support her.\u201cThird Aunt, the matter is settled like this!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou sighed. \u201cWhat do you think I have been doing the last few days? I wanted to borrow money to buy more land to plant more. But sadly wasn\u2019t able to! So for now, we can only plant ten mu!\u201dOnce her words were out, everyone was surprised.\u201cYou really are-\u201d Suddenly an idea came to Third Aunt. \u201cYou really want to borrow money?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou nodded, answering her last question.Third Aunt continued. \u201cLook, others aren\u2019t willing to lend. That means this matter isn\u2019t reliable! But you refuse to come to your sense! There is one person you can try asking. If that person is willing as well, then that clearly means this project isn\u2019t doable. Then how about getting rid of that idea?\u201d\u201cWho do you have in mind, Third Aunt?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou blocked out her persuasion, grabbed onto the part before it and urgently asked. Maybe she can really give it a try! As long as there\u2019s hope, she would fight for it.Confound, Third Aunt replied, \u201cYou don\u2019t remember? You have a cousin called Fang Qing. Four years ago, she married into neighboring Shuang Liu county town\u2019s Su Family! That Su Family is very wealthy. In that family, there\u2019s one son, your cousin-in-law and one daughter. They have numerous amount of farmland and a countless number of shops! Completely overspilling with wealthy. Her mother and your mother were cousins. Your maternal grandmother and hers are blood-related!\u201dLian Ze\u2019s expression shown sudden realization. \u201cI kinda recall Mother telling us about it. She said that Aunt lived with her at Grandma\u2019s place for some time when they were young. Aunt and Mother were pretty close! However, she had already died from sickness a few years ago. Aunt only has one daughter, cousin Fang Qing. Mother had helped her out, but later on, her family has moved. Hear she supposedly married into Shuang Liu\u2019s rich family. Because they\u2019re quite a distance from us, we couldn\u2019t stay in contact.\u201dLian Fang Zhou was slightly confused from listening, but she did understand a part of it. One, the two households have a family connection but haven\u2019t got together for a long time. Two, this family connection is quite far away\u2026To borrow from a relative that they haven\u2019t connect with for a long time is quite tricky, even if there\u2019s some relationship with the previous generation.Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s mind turned. She decided to give it a try\u2013Maybe, by some tiny chance, it will work out?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 68": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Picking Up a General to Plow the FieldsChapter 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay68. Bumped into a blackmailer.\u201cIt\u2019s her!\u201d Third Aunt clapped and blurted, \u201cWhen I was at Tian Family I heard people talked about it. There\u2019s no mistake! I heard that family is one of the wealthiest in Shuang Liu county! Since you\u2019re related, so they\u2019ll most likely agree when asked.\u201d\u201cBut we didn\u2019t stay in touch for a good few years now. We can\u2019t remember what cousin Fang Qing look like. So isn\u2019t it a bit out of the blue to ask them to lend us money\u2026\u201dLian Ze was full of hesitation.Then the tale of Granny Liu bringing Ban er to the Jia Manor (refer to a scene of famous Chinese literature, the dream of Red Chamber) came to Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s mind. Could it be that she will receive the same treatment?After contemplating for a bit, she gave in to temptation, since the benefit of growing cotton is enormous. She gritted her teeth and delivered her decision as she looked at the two little ones. \u201cSince it\u2019s like that, we can\u2019t drag it any longer. Ah Ze and I will head out tomorrow. You guys, be good and stay with Third Aunt at home. \u201d\u201cI\u2019ll come along!\u201d Ah Jian who remained silent til now, spoke out. \u201cThe journey there is far, so it\u2019s best that I accompany you!\u201dEveryone couldn\u2019t help remember the matter on the journey back on the day they first met Ah Jian. Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t reject his offer and grinned, \u201cAlright. Us three go!\u201d\u201cAs for the charcoal making, I\u2019ll give Aunt Zhang a heads up. \u201d After a beat, Lian Fang Zhou continued. When the time comes to split the money, it\u2019s no big deal when they take less.After a moment of more discussion, Lian Fand Zhou rushed over to Aunt Zhang\u2019s home to give a clear explanation. When she returned she asked if the charcoal was sent to Uncle and Aunt? After Lian Ze reported that it was already delivered, she let it go.One night silently passed.Early next day, Lian Fang Zhou, Ah Jian, and Lian Ze left home. No one in the village owned a horse carriage. So they could only rent one when they get to the town.Once they reached the town, the sun had just risen, and the morning cold fog drifted around.The three of them each got a bowl of soup noodle at a roadside stall. After they finished eating, they made way to the horse bank (replace taxi bank) to pick a carriage.Very quickly, they settled on a bargained price and set out on their journey to Shuang Liu county.Actually, Lian Fang Zhou was full of antsy. After all, she doesn\u2019t have any impression of that cousin, and now the other person became a wealthy person. The other person may not believe her when she asked to borrow money and promised to return it definitely. In their eyes, she is someone trying to extort money.If the opportunity wasn\u2019t so hard to come by, Lian Fang Zhou would never be willing to bring herself to do this.\u201cOh yeah!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou suddenly asked. \u201cHow was our cousin\u2019s family condition before she married? It should\u2026\u201dLian Ze shook his head, said \u201cActually, I\u2019m not sure. Anyway, it definitely won\u2019t be a really well-off household.\u201dLian Fang Zhou was silent. She thought, then how could the Su Family allow her to marry to their only son? This matter seems too odd. It couldn\u2019t be that cousin is a concubine? If it is, then there\u2019ll be some difficulty.Lian Fang Zhou was only mentally muttered, while Lian Ze spoke it out loud \u201cSister, Third Aunt said Su Family is wealthy, then why did they marry in cousin Fang Qas a daughter-in-law? Could it be Third Aunt was lying?\u201d.The siblings considered and discussed for a while and came up with nothing but doubts.In the end, Ah Jian couldn\u2019t hold back his laughter. \u201cWhat is there to guess? We\u2019re already halfway there, so when we\u2019re there we\u2019ll know, right? And our purpose is to borrow money, so what does it have to do with us how they got married?\u201dWith these words, Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze erupt into laughter.\u201cYou\u2019re right. When we are there, we\u2019ll know!\u201dLian Fang Zhou chuckled. The three of them then started other trivial small talks. They weren\u2019t feeling one bit solitary.Suddenly the horse carriage came to an abrupt halt and stopped moving.The carriage violently shook. Lian Fang Zhou raised the curtain to look outside and saw the two sides were the green mountainous scenes. They were still traveling!\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked the driver.The driver had already hopped off the carriage, spreaded out his hands. \u201cThe carriage has broken down, Miss. Afraid it\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d\u201cHow did this happen?\u201dLian Fang Zhou wrinkled her brows and also got off the carriage.Lian Ze and Ah Jian also followed her down.\u201cIs the damage terrible? Can it be repaired?\u201dLian Ze enquired.\u201cLook at what you\u2019re saying, little brother!\u201dThe driver gruffly laughed. \u201cSure it can be repaired, but right now we\u2019re in the middle of nowhere. So how am I suppose to get it repaired? Oh, I\u2019m so unlucky. This trip is all for nothing. After all this hard work, I can\u2019t earn enough for repairs. And also my horse, taking this long journey, he\u2019ll need a few days rest. If I knew earlier, I wouldn\u2019t have come\u2026\u201dHearing the driver grumbled in anger as well as lamented in bitter and was not straying from the word money, Lian Fang Zhou sensed something else and simply stood there unmovingly as she watched what he exactly want to do.Lian Ze was truly feeling anxious when he worriedly look at that broken horse carriage.While Ah Jian carefully inspected the carriage for a while and offhandedly pointed out, \u201cYour carriage has no problem at all. How can you say its broken?\u201dThe driver was immediately paused before he disgruntledly argued. \u201cHow is it not broken? Didn\u2019t feel that large jolt when you were inside? It\u2019s my own carriage, how could I not know? If it was in fine condition, why would I stop? What do you know? Don\u2019t go speaking nonsense!\u201d\u201cThen,\u201d Ah Jian suggested. \u201cyou go sit inside, I\u2019ll drive the carriage.\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201d The driver answered without a single thought. \u201cThis is my carriage. My horse. How can I trust you not purposely to crash and damage my horse and my carriage?\u201dAh Jian wanted to persuade him, but Lian Fang Zhou lightly pulled on his sleeve. With a steady gaze, she looked at the driver and asked, \u201cJust frankly tell us what you want to do.\u201dLian Fang Zhou\u2019s words were so straightforward that the driver whose heart was full of schemes, couldn\u2019t react. Out of anger and embarrassment, he immediately glared and yelled, \u201cWhat do you mean by this?\u201d\u201cI should be asking you that,\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smirked. \u201cGive me an obvious answer. Are you going to drive or not?\u201dThe driver was filled with enraged embarrassment on the inside, but he could only keep on enduring. \u2013-who told him to have deceitful intention?He didn\u2019t give an outright answer; instead, he sprouted a load of nonsense. The main point was the carriage was broken. If they need to continue the journey, it is possible. It\u2019s just that it\u2019ll cause more damage to the wagon and the horse will be even more exhausted. He will also be put on a tight spot. That\u2019s why the price won\u2019t be what they previously agreed. In three words: Increase in price!Ah Jian and Lian Ze was dumbfounded, while Lian Fang Zhou snorted out a laugh.The most infuriating part was his tone. He\u2019s enduring his pain to drive the carriage, and they must pay more and still be grateful to him and be in his debt.If he wanted to increase a bit, she\u2019d let it go and endure and swallow down this disgusting fly as she is in anxious to make her way. But the initially four silver coin became two liang and four silver coins. The three of them was enraged.\u201cYou are going to far! We clearly agreed on the price, so how can you do this! You are too crooked!\u201dLian Ze roared in anger.\u201cHow am I crooked?\u201d The driver refuted back. \u201cI already clearly explained the reason for increasing the price, no? No matter where I\u2019m in the right! I\u2019m not profiting from the extra two liang. It can barely cover the repair cost.\u201dAs to what Ah Jian said about his carriage is in excellent condition, was being ignored automatically by the driver.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We\u2019ll walk then.He also added, \u201cSince you can afford to sit on a carriage, then why are you caring about these two bits of money! Quickly discuss among yourselves, there\u2019s still a long way to go. \u201dThis was reminding them, the road is still long if you don\u2019t ride the carriage, how are you going to get there?Lian Fang Zhou peer over at Ah Jian, then at Lian Ze. They all have the same thought, \u2018They can\u2019t become a squanderer, as it is very insulting to them to have such label\u2019.\u201cSince it\u2019s like that, we won\u2019t ride it anymore. After all, we have no urgent matter on our hand. It\u2019s the same to walk there!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou decided\u201cFoolish!\u201d A snigger burst out from the driver. Then his tone became a bit softer, and with full of compassion expression, he persuaded, \u201cRelying on two legs, you won\u2019t reach there even after the day darkened. Once you reach, you\u2019ll need to stay in an inn. It won\u2019t be a matter of two liang then! So why must you!\u201d\u201cWe want to! At least our heart will be comfortable!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou unhesitatingly answered.Lian Ze, who had already prepare to take a step forward, turned his head at this moment. \u201cSister, why bother with him anymore? Brother Ah Jian, let\u2019s go!\u201dLian Fang Zhou and Ah Jian exchanged a glance and started moving.\u201cChoosing to spend big money over little money. Oh, I really don\u2019t know what you guys are thinking! From the look of it, you guys aren\u2019t super well off, so why must you do this out of ire\u201d The driver became agitated and yelled from their behind.Lian Fang Zhou and the other two didn\u2019t even bother with him, just kept on going without turning their head.\u201cThen you guys take your time walking. With your pace, you won\u2019t reach there even after day darkened! Up ahead, there\u2019s a deserted area, heaven knows whether any wild beast would appear. You guys should be careful! No matter what don\u2019t lose your life!\u201d The driver called out again.Lian Ze snorted, \u201cI wish we would come across a wild beast, that way I can see how good my martial art has become!\u201dAh Jian laughed, \u201dYou\u2019re already quite skilled. You can probably kill a wolf without a problem. Hm, if it\u2019s a tiger or bear, it\u2019s too early.\u201d\u201cBrother Ah Jian, when am I able to kill a tiger or bear?\u201d\u201cAbout this, it\u2019s hard to tell. I\u2019ll need to see how much you improve to know\u2026\u201dLian Fang Zhou was dumbfounded as the two of them got into a discussion on martial art. If the driver were listening, he would also be bewildered, right?After walking for fifteen minutes, they passed through a mountainside gap. On the road\u2019s bend grew an enormous maple tree in lush condition. From visual inspection, it might take around four to five people to hug the whole circumference. The full mass of branches and leaves almost covered a section of the road with its shadow.From this sight, Ah Jian eyes lit up and pointed out, \u201cAfter this point, it\u2019s not that far. We\u2019ll probably reach there around half a sichen (so one hour)!\u201dHearing this, the Lian siblings knew Ah Jian must have passed by here when he was wandering in the past. Full of delight, Lian Fang Zhou exclaimed, \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful! We\u2019ll keep on going then.\u201d\u201cYes! Save us from enduring the driver\u2019s unfair treatment! Oh, we still haven\u2019t paid him his fee!\u201d It suddenly dawned Lian Ze, and he blurted it out.Lian Fang Zhou snorted a laugh, raising a brow she disdainful said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t owe him what\u2019s his.\u201dThat\u2019s the last trick up his sleeve! Judging from how skilled he is, it\u2019s definitely not the first time doing this kind of stuff, so he must have it all thought out well and meticulously planned.Lian Ze stopped in his track. Before he could regain his wits, carriage\u2019s rattle and horse hooves galloping could be heard from behind.\u201cWooah\u2013\u201d That driver caught up and reduced his speed. He gave them a taunting grin, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel pleasant to walk, right? It doesn\u2019t compare to riding a carriage right? When you reach the town, your leg would be falling off, so how could you still handle your business? Oh well, who told me to be kind-hearted and can\u2019t endure looking at you in this state. You can pay six coins. I\u2019ll just treat it as being put into a disadvantage and just give you a ride!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll pass!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled and let out a sigh. \u201cWho told us to be kind-hearted, and couldn\u2019t bear to seeing you being in a disadvantage, you can carry on going!\u201dLian Ze and Ah Jian burst into snickers at that.Lian Ze harrumphed, \u201cStop beguiling us! There\u2019s only an hour more walk from here. You\u2019re a horrible person!\u201dThe driver was visibly shocked. He immediately followed up, \u201cWhat do you understand! Is it you or is it me who is familiar with this road? If you think like that, then don\u2019t blame me if something happened on the road!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou spoke.The driver saw that they obviously made up their mind to not travel in his carriage anymore, yelled out. \u201cWait\u201dHe rushed up to block their way. \u201cWhat about the carriage fee? We had already agreed on four silver coin, you must pay me, right? There\u2019s no reason to ride a carriage and not pay for it! It\u2019s asking for people to accuse you!\u201d\u201cWe haven\u2019t reached the town yet, so what reason do you demand four coins!\u201d Lian Ze furiously rebutted.Lian Fang Zhou backed him up. \u201cMy brother is right! Naturally, we\u2019ll pay the fee but how far we traveled is how much we\u2019ll pay! Well, according to you, we\u2019ll have to walk till the day darken before we reach. Even if we go according to your carriage speed, which is five times quicker than us walking. Then we should have only ridden a tiny part of the journey! The whole journey is four silver, then that short ride work out to\u2013\u201dLian Fang Zhou divided by four with the help of finger for a while and concluded: \u201cFinished counting! We\u2019ll suffer a disadvantage and pay you fifty wen!\u201d\u201cYou \u2013\u201d The driver was driven mad by her that his nose was nearly slanted. His face turned white then green as he fumed. \u201cYou can\u2019t cheat like that! We clearly passed the halfway point of the journey! You must at least pay me three silver!\u201dThe three of them remained silent and just stared at him.The driver felt angry, agitated and embarrassed. With his face dyed red, he waved his hand. \u201d Fine, give me two silver then!\u201d\u201cSo, this says, what you said earlier were lies?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou coldly uttered.The driver just snorted and remained silent.Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t bother to argue about it cause there was no point! It\u2019s just that their luck was terrible, and chance upon someone who likes petty gains. She took out two coins and put it on the carriage edge and frostily disclosed, \u201cWe won\u2019t take advantage of you. We also dare not to ride your carriage anymore. Please leave!\u201dFinishing, she turned and left with Ah Jian and Lian Ze. The driver remained rooted to the spot for a moment and mumbled something before he turns the carriage around and went.\u201cSister, you\u2019re so cool. My heart is more at ease now!\u201d Lian Ze grinned.\u201cYou already guessed he\u2019ll come after us?\u201d Ah Jian asked.Lian Fang Zhou grinned, \u201cHe put so much effort to scheme and be shameless to extort some more money from us. So no matter what he forgets, there\u2019s no way he would forget the carriage money!\u201dAh Jian and Lian Ze paused before they burst into waves of laughter.Image result for pergola in chinaChinese PergolaThe three of them continue their journey in chatters and laughter. It wasn\u2019t one bit solitary. Because they got rid of the bitterness in their heart, their foot had picked up the pace and did not feel exhaustion at all.When a pergola can be seen on the roadside at a far distance, Ah Jian pointed at it and suggested, \u201cWe can rest a bit at the pergola. Over there has spring water from the back mountain that can quench thirst!\u201d\u201cAlright, let\u2019s pick up the pace!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled in delight.Because they were originally riding a carriage, and thought it won\u2019t be a long journey, they didn\u2019t prepare any water to drink on the road. Who knew halfway there, that matter has cropped up. They are thirsty after so much walking. So with Ah Jian\u2019s word, the Lian siblings became more energetic.When they came up to the front of the pergola, they can see spring water coming down from the back of the mountain using a system of connected bamboo tubes. The water flowing was pure and clean. With resonant sound, it feeds into a groove and floats away.Inside the pergola also have long stone bench, allowing people to sit down and rest. The ground was also clean.\u201cSis! Brother Ah Jian! Look over there!\u201d Lian Ze suddenly pointed as he cried out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Picked up a bundleLian Fang Zhou and Ah Jian looked over. It was a jade green color with dark vine pattern, satin packaging. From the outside, it was neatly and tightly wrapped. It must have been packed with a lot of things.With one look, you can tell it wasn\u2019t something an ordinary person could own.\u201cDon\u2019t know how who could so careless to leave this behind.\u201d Lian Fang Zhou commented. She stepped forward, picked up the baggage and gave it a few squeezes. It was a soft and thick feel as if it was mink fur item inside.Then she opened it up to have a look inside. There were two pieces of glossy, smooth sable fur, a royal blue, thick clothe and some bank notes. She counted it. A total of five thousand liang of banknote! There was also silver blue, exquisitely embroidered purse. Inside was a few pieces of silver nuggets and seven gold leaves and two thumb size pearl.This a huge amount of money!The three of them froze in surprise.\u201cThat person is really careless! Even if their family is very wealthy, this lot isn\u2019t a tiny amount of sum!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou pondered for a moment before she continued. \u201cI say the owner will most likely come back to looking for it. How about we wait for them.\u201dAt the start, Lian Ze face shown a bit of conflict. He was afraid that Lian Fang Zhou would take the opportunity to keep those stuff so hearing her say this, he let go a sigh of relief and nodded. \u201cAlright! We\u2019ll wait!\u201dFrom what he observed so far, Ah Jian knew how despair Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s need for money was. So in front of such large temptation, her eyes have never changed and her words also didn\u2019t waver. Ah Jian hold great respect for her on the inside, as he spoke out, \u201cThen let\u2019s wait! Otherwise, even if we don\u2019t take it, someone else will take it away!\u201dAfter a quarter of an hour, the three of them can hear a rapid cluster of clip-clop. With a blur, a young footboy wearing black and brown clothing and a cap hurriedly hopped off the horse and bolted into the pergola.With just a scan, the footboy saw right there was Lian Fang Zhou openly sat there holding the bundle. Immediately he was overcome with surprise and delight. He quickly strode forward, \u201cThank Heaven it wasn\u2019t lost! Miss, this bundle is my master. Quickly return it to me!\u201dAs he said that, he reached out to grab that bundle.Lian Ze and Ah Jian were relieved. Now that the bundle owner finally came back, they no longer have to wait.\u201cHold it!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou sidestepped to avoid him.That footboy halted, then promptly assured, \u201cMiss, don\u2019t worry. We give you a sufficient amount of thank you gift!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean! If we seek a return from you, wouldn\u2019t it be better to simply take this bundle?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou tested. \u201cHow do I know if this bundle is really yours? Tell me what is inside. Answer right, naturally I\u2019ll return it to you! And also to save future trouble, we must check if there\u2019s anything missing from the bundle as well!\u201dWhat if he insists that something is missing and claim that they secretly took it? Who could they ask justice for?Immediately the footboy panicked and with impatience, he burst out, \u201d I still need to be on my way! I have no time to deal with this! If this bundle wasn\u2019t my master, how would I know to come to look for a bundle here? Rest assured, we are clean and decent people. We wouldn\u2019t accuse you of taking things!\u201dRegaining his wits, Lian Ze said, \u201cMy sister is right! Some things still need to be made clear!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of few words. Just say, and it\u2019ll be done, right?\u201d Ah Jian chipped in.The footboy inspected Ah Jian. He mentally determined that he wouldn\u2019t be able to snatch it. So he bitterly smiled, \u201d But, the bundle is my master. I don\u2019t know what is exactly stored inside!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s simple. Just ask your master!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou answered.The footboy had no way of swaying, so he could only nod. \u201cAlright! The three of you, please follow me! My master is just up ahead waiting!\u201dLian Fang Zhou and the others agreed and followed him.After walking for a small period, a slim and graceful young man in a dark green cloak and hair tied up high stood with his back to them came into view. And a roan horse without a speck of mark on its whole body was tied to a tree trunk at the side.Hearing movement, he unhurriedly turned around. Seeing his footboy leading three people over, he couldn\u2019t help paused for a bit.Lian Fang Zhou lifted her head to have a look. The man had grown sideburns and thin lips like moon crescent. Under his dark green cloak was a silver blue with dark lining brocade robe and a jade belt tied at his waist. It highlighted his slender build. His face was like white jade and Very handsome. His whole body exuded a noble bearing, which made people dare not to look straight at him.\u201cYoung Master\u201d The footboy quickly stepped forward and quietly explained to that young master.After the explanation, the young master was surprised and turned to size up the three people that came over.The dignified manner brought out from his whole temperament, and handsome appearance also followed. Lian Ze couldn\u2019t help feeling a sense of inferiority as he slightly dropped his head, not daring to look straight at him. While Ah Jian just casually stood there, not feeling it all. Lian Fang Zhou confidently meet with his gaze, stepped up a bit. She declared with a polite slight smile. \u201cSir, as long as you say what\u2019s inside this bundle correctly, we\u2019ll return it to you!\u201dThis young master was feeling puzzled on the inside from the different reaction he witnessed. From the clothes on them, he can tell they were ordinary common people. People like that wouldn\u2019t have their response when they meet a wealthy noble person.When he looked over, the half-grown youth\u2019s reaction is normal; the grown male was so steadfast like a mountain. It had steady natural air to it and not expose a single bit of weakness. Instead, it made him subconsciously feel \u2014 awe. When that word float to his mind, he couldn\u2019t help secretly laugh. How could that be!And also that little miss. From the look of it, she just came to age. She was actually confident and dared to meet his gaze. Not a bit arrogant or humble and spoke clearly and comprehensively.Cui Shao Xi unconsciously smiled and deliberately asked, \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t remember what is inside this bundle? Miss won\u2019t return it to me?\u201dWhen this person smiled, it was like the east wind brush by with fresh flower flying. It so gorgeous that one dare not watch. Those narrow eyes that also carried a tint of mirthfulness are what can be called seductive eyes like silk. (TLN: what kind of comparison is this???)Lian Ze felt embarrassed even to look.Lian Fang Zhou could tell he was joking around and her impatience flared up. She said, \u201cSir isn\u2019t saying? Then it must not be yours, sir! We\u2019ll hand it over to Yamen then. If sir have anything to say, then go say it at Yamen!\u201dSaying that she signaled to Ah Jian and Lian Ze and turned to leave.\u201cHey!\u201d Cui Shao Xi hurried to block them. With a smile, he spoke, \u201cI was just joking! You\u2019re a girl; to always talk about Yamen, you aren\u2019t afraid of seeing official!\u201dLian Fang Zhou felt like she really shouldn\u2019t have acted so meddlesomely. At that time, she should have pretended not to see the bundle and just left.\u201cAlright! Alright! I\u2019ll speak! Let me think\u2013\u201d Cui Shao Xi saw that she just silently stare at him with some impatience in her expression, he lost his interest. Rubbing his nose, he listed it out. \u201cUm, there\u2019s two pieces of sable fur, a piece of silk and satin clothing and also five thousand liang in notes. Inside the purse are few gold leaves, two pearls, and few silver nuggets! Miss, \u201dHe lightly let out a breath. He helplessly waved his hands, \u201cI actually don\u2019t remember the specific amount inside the purse!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The wealthy are really wayward!These were pocket money, convenient for when he wants to buy something. So he doesn\u2019t bother to keep track on how much he has.\u201cWhat color is the purse? What was embroidered on it?\u201dLian Fang Zhou questioned.Cui Shao Xi glance at her and cheerfully answered: \u201cFrom I remember, silver blue. Embroidered with emerald green gourd and gourd leaves.\u201dOnly then did Lian Fang Zhou pass the bundle to him, asserted. \u201cOpen it and check. don\u2019t accuse us of stealing later on.\u201dHis footboy harrumphed in annoyance. \u201cWhat do you mean by that? My young master isn\u2019t that kind of person!\u201d\u201cLoudmouth!\u201d Cui Shao Xi threw a glare at the little manservant. He recklessly opened the bundle and carelessly counted the notes, then pulled open the purse and acted as if he looked over the content. He turned to Lian Fang Zhou and stated, \u201cI have inspected them, nothing is missing.\u201dThe footboy at the side, twitched his mouth as he thought, \u2018young master can you even check it clearly like this?\u2019Lian Fang Zhou and the others weren\u2019t blind. They could see that this young master had no intention to inspect seriously. He was just putting a show due to Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s wordLian Fang Zhou find this person so irksome; to hold so much money and treat it as nothing. She internally sighed, \u2018The wealthy are really wayward! Sigh.\u2019\u201cSince it\u2019s like that, the lost property has returned to rightful owner, we\u2019ll take our leave! \u201d Lian Fang Zhou nodded her head.\u201cOh,\u201d Cui Shao Xi stopped her again. With a grin, he tested: \u201cIf I said something is missing, what would you do?\u201dLian Fang Zhou cast a glance over and said, \u201cIf the inside doesn\u2019t match to what you said then that means that bundle isn\u2019t yours! Then we can only send it over to Yamen!\u201dCui Shao Xi froze then burst into waves of laughter.Once his laughter subsided, Lian Fang Zhou and the others had already left.\u201cCountry girl really don\u2019t know how to speak! The bundle is clearly ours, but she had to make up all these reasoning. In the end, the bundle is still returned to us!\u201d the footboy Cui Yi mumbled.Cui Shao Xi rolled his eyes and chided, \u201cwhat do you understand! That miss is quite smart!\u201dDisagreeing, Cui Yi sulked as he argued, \u201cthis servant doesn\u2019t feel she\u2019s clever. This servant finds her too long winded!!\u201dAfter a pause, he continued. \u201cHowever, just now young master should have given her some reward money, to avoid her belittling young master.\u201dEven though they might not meet again and each doesn\u2019t know the other, Cui Yi felt uncomfortable that his young man would be looked down on by Lian Fang Zhou.\u201cTo say such silly words!\u201dCui Shao Xi gently rapped his head. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t want it even if we gave her! However\u2026\u201d However, he should have asked for her name.He self mockingly laughed and shooked his head. Would she tell him when asked?\u201cHow does young master know she won\u2019t?\u201dCui Yi immediately talked back. \u201cYoung Master have few thousand liang inside the bundle in addition to two pieces of sable fur, clothe and things inside the purse. It\u2019s worth over ten thousand altogether! She\u2019s just an ordinary commoner. Afraid she never saw such a large amount of money for a few lifetimes. So she wouldn\u2019t dare to covet them, right? Since it\u2019s asking for trouble! However, she would accept a bit of reward money!\u201dCui Shao Xi swept a gaze over to him, remarked, \u201cThough you are foolish, you are also not!\u201d\u201cIs servant\u2019s deduction correct, young master?\u201d Cui Yi eyes lit up as asked.\u201cA bunch of absurd reasoning! Let\u2019s go. Don\u2019t make Uncle and Aunt anxiously wait!\u201d Cui Shao Xi exasperatedly glared at him, walked to the side, untied the rein and hopped onto the horse.Not long later, the master and servant pair caught up to Lian Fang Zhou and the others. When he passed by them, he pulled the rein to slow down. On the horse, he cupped his hands toward them, but his eyes were focused on Lian Fang Zhou. With a grin, he announced, \u201cMany thanks! The surname, Cui and the name, Cui Shao Xi. If you need any help, go and let the town\u2019s Jun Yue Restaurant know!\u201dFinishing, he gave her a nod. Without waiting for her to speak, urge the horse through whipping and speed away. Before long, he disappeared from the three\u2019s vision.\u201cSister, that person really is, really is\u2013\u201d Lian Ze couldn\u2019t find the word to describe him.Ah Jian couldn\u2019t help glimpse at Lian Fang Zhou. He doesn\u2019t know why his heart feels faintly uncomfortable. Cui Shao Xi, his instinctly dislike the other person.\u201cJun Yue Restaurant? You want to go look for help from him? From the look of it, it\u2019ll save a lot of trouble by asking him!\u201d Ah Jian couldn\u2019t resist mentioning.Lian Fang Zhou shook her head, stated, \u201cReturning the things to him was only a slight effort. The other might possibly just said that without thinking. We can\u2019t treat it seriously!\u201d\u201cUn!\u201d Ah Jian broke into a grin. \u201cThat Su Family\u2019s young madam\u2019s mother and your mother used to have deep ties, so presumably Su Family\u2019s young madam will definitely meet you!\u201d\u201cHope it\u2019s like that!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou laugh. She was slightly baffled why Ah Jian suddenly was in a good mood.After a few delays on the road, it was already past noon when the three of them reached the town. Amid the crowded market, they look for a small shop to eat lunch. They ask around for Su Family\u2019s address while they are at it.Shuang Liu County appeared to be more bustling and energetic than Yun He County. Two large rivers ran along the city, Qing Yang river and Guang Yang. That\u2019s where Shuang Liu County come from. (Shuang means double, Liu means flow)It\u2019s because there are two large rivers as well as the area is located at the center of a traffic junction, maritime cargo comes and go, making it very lively and it is what makes Shuang Liu County buzzing.Once the three of them asked around about Su Family, the shop owner mentioned, \u201cThe East side of town\u2019s Su Family on Shuang He lane? That\u2019s our Shuang Liu\u2019s wealthiest! Which manor\u2019s housekeeper or servant are you looking for?\u201dLian Fang Zhou froze in place. Su Family became the local wealthiest!After some contemplation, she enquired, \u201cIs the Su Family\u2019s young madam surnamed Fang? Su Family only have one young master and one young miss, right?\u201dThe shop owner gave her a strange look and nodded. \u201d That\u2019s right! Though the Su Family have a prosperous amount of wealth but not a lot in family number. The Su Family master couple have only one son and one daughter! However, that was before. After the young madam married in, she gave birth to a chubby baby for the Su Family in her second year. Now she has two sons! Su Family\u2019s Master and Madam is overjoyed and dote the young madam a lot. Oh, that young madam is really lucky. Heard she came from a poor background. This is flying up the branches and turn into a phoenix! But it\u2019s no wonder, not only did that young madam give birth to two sons at such a young age, but she\u2019s also skillful! She is proficient in managing the business. However, it\u2019s Young Master Su who\u2019s retreating back to the ground\u2026\u201dNow Lian Fang Zhou was sure that wealthy Su Family is the Su Family she was looking for. She gratefully smiled as she thanked the shop owner and left with Ah Jain and Lian Ze.The three of them using the address given by the shop owner, they arrived at Su Family\u2019s entrance on Shuang He Lane. There stood a brightly painted towering gatehouse and two huge crouching stone lion, one left and one right. A tall, thick, red painted door was closed tightly with a copper beast head knocker that was bigger than a human head.The large doorway was covered with neatly aligned, stony green tiles was swept clean. It was bright and peaceful as the afternoon rays beamed down.They stepped forward. Ah Jian grasped the knocker and lightly knocked on the massive door. Not long later, the giant door let out a dull groan as it was half opened by someone. A servant dressed like a footboy swept a glance at them and asked, \u201cMay I ask who are you looking for?\u201dWithin his words was utmost politeness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was initially worried that the wealthy family\u2019s doorman would have been so high and mighty and look down on people. She was already prepared to break her wallet; never expect that she would meet an amicable one.\u201cIs your esteem manor\u2019s Young Madame home? I\u2019m looking for her! Must trouble you to pass a message over!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou cordially beseeched.\u201cPlease help us out, brother!\u201d Ah Jian took out his hand, stuffed few silver nuggets that was around half liang into the doorman\u2019s hand.The doorman was used to handling these kinds of matter. With just a squeeze of a hand, he can estimate how much is inside. He gave them a once over with a strange look. Though they dressed up so ordinarily, they display such generosity.\u201cLooking for our Young Madame? May I ask what relationship do you have with our Young Madame? Our Young Madame is very busy! Not just anyone can meet her!\u201d the doorman stated.Lian Fang Zhou started to feel somewhat embarrassed. If she says she\u2019s their young madam relative, most definitely will receive a shock expression or an eye roll?\u201cJust say Lian Family from Da Fang village in Yunhe county. Your Young Madame should understand!\u201d uttered Lian Fang Zhou.\u201cYunhe County?\u201d the doorman eyes lit up and grinned. \u201cOur Young Madame\u2019s family is from Yunhe. However, I never heard of something Lian Family, Da Fang village. Alright, I\u2019ll get someone to help you send a word. I cannot guarantee, if Young Madame would meet you!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s of course. We are already deeply grateful that you can help send a word!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled.\u201cThen you wait here!\u201d Seeing Lian Fang Zhou speaking so politely and sounded so pleasant to the ear, he merrily grinned, closed the door and went to call the old woman at the second gate to help pass a word.The three of them had waited a full half an hour. There wasn\u2019t a single movement from the inside. Lian Ze whispered, \u201cSister, do we still have to wait? It couldn\u2019t be that the doorman was fooling us?\u201d\u201cSince we are already here, it goes without saying we need to wait! Otherwise, we wasted a trip to here!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou respondedAh Jian then followed up, \u201cDon\u2019t worry too much. Didn\u2019t they say Su Young Madame handle most of Su Manor business? Therefore she should regularly be out. If we can\u2019t enter, we can wait outside. We\u2019ll eventually be able to wait it out.\u201d\u201cEn!\u201dLian Fang Zhou heart warmed and cheerfully nodded at Ah Jian.Image result for \u00e8\u00a4\u2122\u00e5Over-dressRight then, the door squeak as it opened. Beside the doorman, there was also a middle-aged woman, dressed in claret blossom design on a the over-dress, and stone green long skirt and her hair were shaped into a flattened bun and secured by a silver hairpin.The doorman pointed toward the middle-aged woman and courteously said, \u201cYou\u2019re in luck. This is Li ma, part of Young Madam\u2019s retainers.\u201d\u201cGreetings to Li ma!\u201dLian Fang Zhou affably nodded.Li ma had already studied them a few times. Though the three\u2019s clothes were ordinary and old, it was clean and tidy. Appeared to be upright and straightforward. The younger youth was a bit nervous, but that was normal and not have a glimpse of groveling or flattering expression.Li ma nodded in approval in her mind. And smiled, \u201cI heard that Miss is from Lian Family in Yun He county? May I ask what relation do you have with Liu Family\u2019s Liu Su Mei.\u201dLian Fang Zhou eyes slightly darkened and replied, \u201cShe\u2019s my mother.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s like that!\u201dLi ma exclaimed. \u201cThat means Miss is our Young Madame\u2019s cousin! How is Mrs. Lian doing? Our Young Madame has been thinking about her!\u201dLian Fang Zhou bitterly revealed, \u201cMy mother \u2026have passed away!\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dLi Ma\u2019s expression slightly changed and rapidly enquired, \u201cWhen did this happen?\u201dLian Fang Zhou answered, \u201cIt was half a year ago. She and Father were working in the mountain. Suddenly a torrent of water rushed down the mountain, and the two of them passed away.\u201dLi ma lightly sighed in lament; internally thought \u2018no wonder they came knocking on the door!\u2019 Seeing how they dressed so tidily, it wasn\u2019t so easy for them.She led them to side hall to sit down and ordered the maid to serve tea and cakes. Politely smiled, \u201cMiss, please wait here for a moment! \u201d\u201cEn,\u201d Lian Fang Zhou dipped her head in response and did not question anymore. She knew that she will go report to cousin.Maybe this cousin had previously planned not to meet them. Just treat them as coming to extort money. So it made no difference, letting Li ma take care of it. But hearing her parents have passed away, she must at least meet them.Without a doubt, Li ma came back not long later and apprised, \u201cThis gong zi please enjoy tea and rest here. Miss Lian and Lian gong zi, follow me. Young Madame wants to see you. \u201d\u201cYou guys, head over. I\u2019ll wait for you here! \u201dAh Jian spoke.Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze agreed. And turned to Li ma and said \u2018Must trouble you\u2019 and followed her.Image result for chinese verandaThis image is the most similar one I can find to the description given.Veranda + Tasseled Lantern + Speckle of flowerAfter they entered the second gate, they walked for a good bit before Li ma led them into a courtyard. The door that came into sight was a spacious patio with greyish green tile paving. There were several green flower jars placed on both sides of the road. Presumably, it\u2019ll be gorgeous during summer with the lotus flourishing with green jade leaf. On the flat ground, a few pomegranate, cape jasmine, lilac, and similar flowers were planted with the bricks at the bottom. On the two sides was a mirror copy veranda. Tasseled octangular lanterns hung on the roof of the corridor and roses were planted on the alongside the veranda. At this moment, there were speckles of pink and yellow flower buds.Related imageMoon GateThe courtyard was very spacious and serene. The left and the right side also have a moon gate successively connected to the compound. In the distance were landscaped trees and flowers, a cascade of rockeries and many houses.Image result for five sided chinese pergolaI imagine the room is a smaller version of thisAfter passing through the patio, the raised steps pass through a lobby. The patio at the front was separated by a five-opened large room. The middle of the room is higher, while the sides are slightly shorter. Everything was meticulously arranged, from the carved beams and painted rafters to the bright red door and green jade windows. Li ma guided to the left side veranda to go around, and pleasant mentioned, \u201d You came at a good time today. Young Madame has just woken and not go out yet!\u201dThe four maids, in a different shade of the blue and white long dress, was initially standing attention at the entrance saw them come over. One of them raised the bouncy, dark green curtain and entered to send words. The other three came up to welcome and called, \u201cLi da niang!\u201dLi ma acknowledged. The maid that previously went in to notify returned. She conveyed, \u201cLi da niang, Young Madame request that you lead the guest inside!\u201d\u201cMiss Lian, Lian gong zi, this way please!\u201d Li ma then grinned as she raised her hand to signal.\u201cMust trouble da niang!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou returned a smile. With Lian Ze, she followed her from behind.As they just enter, a beautiful woman, in peach pink with grape purple design and high collared sleeved over-dress and brocade, multi-folded skirt completely covered in blushing red, which was like a good harvest, came into view as the maids cluster around to welcome her. She got almond eyes with peach-like lids, skin fairer than snow and hair was slanted and coiled up. The beaded pendant enchantingly swayed. She was beautiful that she stood out. The light within her eyes shimmered, as if gleaming pond ripples. From one glance, you can tell she is a talented person.Lian Fang Zhou was hesitating whether she should call her \u2018Su Young Madame \u2018 or \u2018Cousin Fang.\u2019 Fang Qing had already stridden forward and held her hands. After studying her a bit, Fang Qing cheerfully opened her mouth, \u201cYou are Fang Zhou right? Do you still remember me? At that time when Aunt brought you over to my home, you were a little girl! This is Ah Ze then? I heard Aunt mention you before, but we have never met! Your eyes are just like Aunt\u2019s!\u201dLian Fang Zhou\u2019s heart was warmed and was feeling mixed up. She chuckled, \u201cI can\u2019t remember at all, I was really young then. Coming over today, I have trespassed on your hospitality. It is really presumptuous \u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We meet again.\u201cDon\u2019t say it like that!\u201d Fang Qing interrupted her. With a kind smile, she said, \u201cWhen my mother was alive, she had the best relationship with Aunt. Even though our generation has never met, the connection can\u2019t be severed just like that!\u201dShe then lightly sighed, \u201cMy mother had a cruel fate. I thought Aunt would live long and be blessed. Never thought she too \u2014 \u201dLian Ze eyes reddened and twisted his head away.Although the current Lian Fang Zhou wasn\u2019t the Lian Fang Zhou when Liu Su Mei passed away, her heart still aches; a dull, agonizing pang appear.\u201cAlright now, it rare for you to come by, I shouldn\u2019t be talking about this. Both of our families haven\u2019t interacted with each other for several years. So I\u2019m delighted that you came over! We can have a good talk!\u201d Fang Qing spoke as she invites the two of them to sit and enquired about the current condition at home and the situation at the time when the couple met with misfortune.Lian Fang Zhou and Lian went into details. Hearing it, Fang Qing was flooded with extreme sadness.\u201cThe most unfortunate are you, siblings! If you need any help, feel free to ask. As long as it\u2019s within my ability, I\u2019ll help you!\u201d Fang Qing assured.Since the siblings came such a long way, Fang Qing knew there was a matter.Lian Fang Zhou receded her emotions, gave her thanks and declared, \u201cCousin, Ah Ze and I have come because there really is a matter we need your help with!\u201dFang Qing nodded, sent a glance at Li ma. Li ma understood and signaled for all the maids that are serving to retreat out of the room.Lian Fang Zhou was grateful as she knew Fang Qing didn\u2019t want to make her ask before an audience of servants. Although she (Fang Qing) don\u2019t know what she came for, she can guess it is related to money.\u201cDo tell\u201d Fang Qing encouragingly smiled.Lian Fang Zhou then slowly spoke \u201cI want to borrow a sum of money from cousin. I\u2019ll definitely return it within two-three years.\u201d\u201cYou have ambition! State how much you want to borrow.\u201d Fang Qing gave a faint smile.Lian Fang Zhou chuckled, \u201cSince cousin asked like that, then I\u2019ll tell you upright! I want to borrow ten thousand liang!\u201dOrdinary women from the inner household couldn\u2019t compare to Fang Qing, as she controls a part of Su family\u2019s business. So hearing what Lian Fang Zhou requested, she didn\u2019t gasp in surprise. Only her expression slightly changed.Li ma, who was standing respectfully from her behind, couldn\u2019t help raised her eyes to send a glance over to Lian Fang Zhou, thinking, \u2018this miss cousin really dare ask.\u2019Ten thousand liang! Does she know how much is ten thousand liang?\u201cTen thousand liang isn\u2019t a small sum. Why are you borrowing so much money? \u201d Fang Qing questioned.Lian Fang Zhou was about to elaborate when a man raised his voice as he casually called out could be heard from the outside. \u201cWhat are you all doing gathering at the door? Who made your Young Madame angry again?\u201dLi ma spoke then, \u201cIt\u2019s Young Master, who has returned! \u201dWith that, Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze stood up. Fang Qing also stood and grinned, \u201cThat\u2019s great, you can meet your cousin-in-law!\u201dHer words just fell, and two male entered sight as they came one after another from outside.The other is her cousin-in-law, so Lian Fang Zhou gave a quick swept of an eye and lowered her lids, just to check out his profile. This Young Master of Su Family, Su Jing He is around twenty five-six of age. He looked pretty handsome and carried an aura of (bad boy) wickedness and unrestrainedness. Or rather, these wealthy families\u2019 son was gifted at being frivolous.\u201cYou have returned! Oh, cousin has also come!\u201d Fang Qing sent an angry stare at Su Jing He and complained, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so earlier?\u201dAfterall Lian Fang Zhou is an unwed girl. At her place, it is alright for her to meet her cousin-in-law. As for other guys, it\u2019s not really appropriate.\u201cI didn\u2019t know you have guests here!\u201d Su Jing He laughed it off. His eyes just swept once over Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze and lost interest. And grinned, \u201cThen I\u2019ll you carry on. Min Zhi (maybe name typo?) and I will leave now. I\u2019ll come back later to look for you!\u201d\u201cWait!\u201d Fang Qing called to stop him. She was about to introduce the Lian siblings to him when her husband\u2019s cousin cried out and chuckled, \u201cMiss, we meet again!\u201dLian Ze raised his eyes and icily stared at him. His sister isn\u2019t for people to poke fun at.Lian Fang Zhou found the voice to be familiar, lifted her head in wonder and Cui Shao Xi\u2019s handsome face filled with mirth appeared clearly into view. Her heart skipped a beat, and her legs froze as she exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d\u201cHahaha! That\u2019s right, it\u2019s me!\u201d Immensely pleased, Cui Shao Xi burst into waves of laughter.Lian Fang Zhou resisted the urge to roll her eyes and twitched her lips. Inside, she thought, \u2018I don\u2019t know what you are so pleased about!\u2019\u201cOh, so you knew each other!\u201d Su Jing He looked to fro between them. His eyes rapidly spun as he gleeful chortled. Before he could finish laughing, a hiss faintly escaped from his mouth. Pain!Fang Qing had pinched him. Eyes dilated as she gave him a fierce stare. Su Jing He wanted to distinguish what\u2019s going on, but in the end, he decided to smile fawningly. Fang Qing just lightly harrumphed and ignored him.\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t know him!\u201dOn this side, Cui Shao Xi and Lian Fang Zhou spoke at the same time.Fang Qing and Su Jing He was surprised, somewhat perplexed.Fang Qing came to the siblings\u2019 side, held onto Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s hand and introduced, \u201cThese are my cousins!\u201dTurning to give Su Jing He a glance, she then continued, \u201cThis is your cousin-in-law! This guy, um, is your cousin-in-law\u2019s cousin. In a way, you can call him cousin.\u201dLian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze automatically overlooked Fang Qing last sentence and just gave greetings to Su Jing He. They called out, \u2018Cousin-in-law!\u2019 and toward Cui Shao Xi they called him \u2018Cui gong zi.\u2019\u201cNo need to be polite! Haha! These are our relatives! How come I never heard you talk about it before!\u201d Su Jing He with smiling eyes as he raised his hands and turned to ask Fang Qing.\u201cBoth of our families haven\u2019t been in contact for many years\u201d Fang Qing lightly sighed, then playfully pushed Su Jing He. \u201cAlright now, you guys have matters to do, so hurry on!\u201dSu Jing He had yet to speak when Cui Shao Xi already plopped himself onto a chair and cheerily snatched to say, \u201cWe got nothing to need to be done. Initially, we came over here to accompany and talk with cousin-in-law! Cousin-in-law won\u2019t kick us out, right?\u201dIt was apparent that Cui Shao Xi was very close to Su Jing He and Fang Qing, as his words were utterly casual. Fang Qing grinned, there was really no reason to kick him out.But in front of these cousins (her husband and his cousin), it was evident that they can\u2019t continue their previous discussion. After some contemplation, Fang Qing had come up with a plan: first put it aside as she had originally planned to let them stay over for two days. They\u2019ll have time to talk again! With a beam, she invited the Lian siblings to sit, exclaimed, \u201cSince it\u2019s like that, everyone can chat together!\u201dRegrettably, even though Fang Qing felt it wasn\u2019t suitable to continue that discussion, someone else didn\u2019t agree. Just as everyone took their seat, Cui Shao Xi carelessly asked, \u201cI recall hearing something about ten thousand liang just now at the entrance. With such a large amount of money, is cousin-in-law planning on doing some big business?\u201dFang Qing\u2019s expression froze. Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze exchanged glances. Lian Fang Zhou was mentally giving Cui Shao Xi a severe scolding. Does this person have any sense of discernment? Really, what does he mean by this! Definitely up to no good!Author note: actually, about that, Su Jing He and Fang Qing have an exciting story, where the shrewish wife taming husband. However, I won\u2019t talk about now. Wait until when I finish, I\u2019ll write the side story!Translator note: Why don\u2019t I have any recollection of Fang Qing and Su Jing He side story!? Hmmm\u2026 I had been over a few years since I finished reading it\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We meet again (part 2)Su Jing He gave Cui Shao Xi a strange look and then turned to look at Fang Qing, asking, \u201cWhy did I not hear that? Ten thousand liang isn\u2019t a small amount! Qing er, what are you about to do?\u201dHe then became fawningly grinned, \u201cNaturally I\u2019ll support whatever you do!\u201dFang Qing rolled her eyes at him, in a quiet voice she criticized, \u201cWhether you support or no, it\u2019ll have no effect!\u201dSu Jing He just heartily laughed, as if being rebuked by his wife made him happier.Fang Qing internally sighed. Those words were true, but since Cui Shao Xi had heard an earful and asked about, she had no choice but to speak about it. So she explained, \u201cIt\u2019s not me who want to use it for something. It\u2019s my cousin who want to borrow it.\u201dCui Shao Xi and Su Jing He were surprised as they widened their eyes.Su Jing He rubbed his head, cheerfully let out an \u2018oh\u2019 and talked no more.Lian Fang Zhou nervously watched Su Jing He\u2019s expression. If his face changed and disapproval emerge in his appearance, then she\u2019s afraid it\u2019ll be much harder to borrow money! After all, ten thousand liang is a small sum of money. Even if he doesn\u2019t know now, Fang Qing will have to discuss with him later. Chances are, they might also need to ask Su Family\u2019s Master and Madame!Cui Shao Xi was also startled when he saw Su Jing He had no signs of unhappiness or unwillingness. Her (Lian Fang Zhou) internal tension was then loosened by half.Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t help mentally sighed, \u2018Borrowing money isn\u2019t easy work to do!\u2019She vowed that from now on, she won\u2019t ever borrow money from other people.Fang Qing directed a reassuring smile at Lian Fang Zhou, softly spoke, \u201cThere\u2019s no outsider here, let\u2019s continue our discussion just now! It\u2019s okay, you can talk however you like.\u201dSu Jing He merrily piped in, \u201cThat\u2019s right! There\u2019s no mistake in what your cousin said!\u201d You can discuss this kind of matter with her!\u201dInside, Lian Fang Zhou was filled with gratitude and said \u201cMany thanks, cousin-in-law!\u201dThen turned to tell Fang Qing, \u201cJust now cousin asked what am I going to do with that money, I want to buy land, hire people and plant cotton. I don\u2019t know if cousin has heard that Yun He County was one the county town was chosen by the imperial government to introduce potato and cotton. I want to give it a try!\u201dIt goings without saying that Fang Qing have heard about it, so she nodded. \u201cI have heard about it! However, I have never seen this potato and cotton. I sent people to investigate but there was no result, so I cast aside and no longer pay attention to it. After all, it got nothing to with our family! You\u2013heard of it? Why do you have such an idea?\u201dLian Fang Zhou replied, \u201cI also haven\u2019t of it before but wasn\u2019t sweet potato also slowly popularize a few years back? It\u2019s just that it wasn\u2019t mandatory to introduce sweet potato at that time. I was thinking, the imperial government wouldn\u2019t trick people! As for potato, it might not be very profitable as there\u2019s already sweet potato. It was said that cotton can make clothes so this might be a big break. That\u2019s why I want to give it a try!\u201dYou got quite a big gut, little lass. However, isn\u2019t your thinking too simplified? What if it fails? What will you do then?\u201d Cui Shao Xi couldn\u2019t help probedHearing him call her \u2018little lass\u2019, Lian Fang Zhou resisted the urge to beat him up. She asserted, \u201cI feel like it\u2019s worth trying. Even if it fails, there won\u2019t be much loss! At least, there\u2019s the land there. With two-three years max, I can still return the ten thousand liang.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that! Don\u2019t misunderstand!\u201d Cui Shao Xi never thought Lian Fang Zhou would respond like this. He immediately felt a bit anxious and a bit embarrassed. Even his face has slightly reddened and awkwardly sent Fang Qing a glance.The way Lian Fang Zhou explained, make it seems like he is afraid that she couldn\u2019t return the ten thousand liang! She wasn\u2019t even borrowing his money, so isn\u2019t this explanation secretly mocking him for meddling into others\u2019 business?Cui Shao Xi was usually a superficial character, doesn\u2019t bother about trifles and charming. There was never a time where he was being put into an embarrassed and awkward position. Su Jing He froze at this sight, while Fang Qing burst into giggles and turned to Lian Fang Zhou and said, \u201cHave cousin really resolved on giving it a try? You must remember that cotton is something that was never seen before and who knows when planting it is there any special to be particular about. Can you handle it?\u201dCui Shao Xi could see that Fang Qing was clearly ridiculing him. He felt even more embarrassed on the inside and became somewhat mad. He thought, \u2018This little lass is really hateful. After this, who know how this couple is going to make fun of me!\u2019Embarrassed and anxious, he rushed to get back some face. With his head flustered, he blurted, \u201cIsn\u2019t it just ten thousand? I can lend it to you! If you earn, then you can return to me and if you fail, you don\u2019t have to return!\u201dLian Fang Zhou sent him an uninterested gaze and coolly spoke out, \u201cCui gong zi and I have no relations at all, so how can I possibly borrow Cui gong zi\u2019s money? I thank you for your kindness, Cui gong zi but I\u2019ll decline!\u201dCui Shao Xi never that when he took the initiative to help would be seen as an annoyance by her. His mouth gaped open but was so depressed that no words came out.From he was young til he grown up, when did he ever received such treatment?Su Jing He burst into a hoot of laughter, which was laced with overwhelming joy. Gloating, he guffawed, \u201cI say, Min Zhi (not a name typo?), you actually have a day like this!\u201dHe found this cousin of his wife very interesting and to his wife he merrily expressed, \u201cQing er, from what I see, cousin\u2019s explanation is reasonable so we can lend the ten thousand silver!\u201dFang Qing smiled but did not answer him. Instead, she watched Lian Fang Zhou and waited for her answer.Not only did Lian Fang Zhou not get angry or displeased, but she also gained appreciation. Fang Qing did not give a reply like it was a game, this is showing her respect to her.Lian Fang Zhou nodded her head and uttered, \u201cCousins, I have given a good thought to the misgivings that cousin mentioned. I want to try!\u201d\u201cEn, since it\u2019s like that, we\u2019ll lend you the ten thousand liang!\u201d Fang Qing glimpsed at Su Qing He and sincerely said to Lian Fang Zhou.Immediately, Lian Fang Zhou as overjoyed, while Lian Ze\u2019s eyes lit up. The two siblings hurriedly stood and thanked Fang Qing and Su Jing He.\u201cNow, no need to be over-courteous!\u201d Fang Qing smiled. \u201cSince you said it\u2019s borrowing, then we\u2019ll lend. We are relatives, so let\u2019s not mention about interest or whatever. I won\u2019t let you worry about when to return, in short, you have to remember to!\u201d\u201cSince both cousins trust us, we extremely grateful! When the time comes, we will definitely return the money!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou promisedFang Qing smilingly nodded and no longer hassled about this matter. \u201cIt \u2018s rare for you to come by, so stay two days before you back! Us cousins (just the girls) can have a good chat!\u201dLian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze looked at each other. With a shake of her head, she replied, \u201cWe can only leave cousin\u2019s kindness for next time! Qing er and Cher er are still at home, I\u2019m a bit worried!\u201d\u201cBut it is already pretty late in the day now, even if you returned, at most you\u2019ll reach Yun He county town when it gets dark! Might as well stay a night here. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll get a horse carriage to send you back. Isn\u2019t this way better?\u201d Fang Qing graciously pointed out, \u201cWe are cousins if you decline anymore then you regarding me as an outsider!\u201dLeft with no other way, Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze could only agree.Fang Qing then turned to call Li ma, \u201cIn a moment, you must personally arrange the guest rooms. For dinner, come over and eat together! Oh right, there\u2019s another person who came with you. He is \u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We meet again (part 3)Lian Fang Zhou answered, \u201cIt\u2019s distantly related relative. His home was attacked by natural disasters, so he\u2019s temporarily staying at our home!\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Fang Qing uttered as she understandingly nodded. Then directed Li ma, \u201cThen arranged it together! Tonight call him to come over to have dinner together!\u201dLian Fang Zhou initially didn\u2019t want to come. But the thought that it would be ungracious not to accept a kind offer, she then courteously smiled as she agreed.At the side, Li ma had already answered to her orders.Fang Qing suggested, \u201cYou must be tired after traveling for half a day, how about go rest a bit now? When it\u2019s time for dinner, I\u2019ll then send someone down to bring you over?\u201dLian Fang Zhou saw that Su Jing He and Cui Shao Xi was still here and as she and her brother have nothing to talk about with them and also it wasn\u2019t convenient to speak with Fang Qing, she decided to follow along and dipped her head in response. She excused herself and trailed after Li ma.All along, Cui Shao Xi had been sporting a sunken face as he sat there. Even until Lian Fang Zhou and the others left, he still remained quiet.Lian Fang Zhou acted like she didn\u2019t see\u2013This initially was no concern of her at all.\u201cI say Min Zhi, your face is so black that you could squeeze ink out. What\u2019s wrong? You\u2019re still vexed by a little lass!\u201d After they left, Fang Qing snickered.Before Su Jing He married, he was a guy who eat, drink and be merry. A silk trouser who done cockfighting and gone through doing all manners of evil. After getting married, Fang Qing had wholly fixed him til he\u2019s docile. He now echoed whatever she says. At her words, he sniggered and piped in, \u201cQing er, you don\u2019t say. Min Zhi\u2019s face is really black! I have never seen it like this before! Haha, Your cousin is quite entertaining! However, from I see, Min Zhi doesn\u2019t look like he is irked. More like \u2013 En, how should I explain? Min Zhi have you fallen in love with the girl?\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense are you saying!\u201d Fang Qing\u2019s face changed and sharply glared at Su Jing He.Su Jing He regretted his slip of a tongue, coughed as apologetically smiled, \u201cWas joking! Joking!\u201dCui Shao Xi understood what this couple meant, grumpily harrumphed, \u201d How could I possibly be annoyed with a little lass! It\u2019s just that little lass is really detestable!\u201dSu Jing He guffawed, \u201cI\u2019m her cousin-in-law, so it\u2019s no big deal that I call her little lass. But you have no relations with her stranger, it does not follow propriety!\u201d\u201cAlright! Speak less!\u201d Fang Qing smilingly complained. To Cui Shao Xi, she said, \u201cAnyhow, what our master said is also the truth! From one look, one can tell my cousin is daring. Better to not sprout nonsense, and save being pricked by her. Otherwise, it\u2019ll be called embarrassing!\u201d\u201cIf she wants to prick you, don\u2019t forget to call me to watch! These kinds of shows are rare sights!\u201d Su Jing He added oil to the fire.Cui Shao Xi didn\u2019t know whether to cry or laugh and mocked, \u201cCousin-in-law, look at cousin! He\u2019s already a dad of two and still have no scruples. Cousin-in-law, you should increase the discipline!\u201dAt this, Su Jing He rested one and on Fang Qing\u2019s shoulder to hug her, shot a grin at Cui Shao Xi as he stated, \u201cYou little brat got a stomach full of bad water (being guile), stop with the driving a wedge here! Fang Qing is my wife. If she doesn\u2019t discipline me, then who? I\u2019m happy to and willing to. What can you do!\u201dCui Shao Xi rebuked back without any thoughts, \u201cThat cause you\u2019re a masoc\u2013\u201d ( in Chinese, it said being cheap, but \u2018masochist\u2019 seem to suit more.)Sensing this word couldn\u2019t be said, he instantly cut short his word. Yet both Su Jing He and Fang Qing already heard it. Su Jing He didn\u2019t really care, but Fang Qing was a different story. Although she smiled at Cui Shao Xi, her eyes weren\u2019t.Cui Shao Xi whacked his head as he bitterly smiled, and said, \u201cOk! Today I got a flimsy mouth, no matter what I say, it is wrong! How about this I\u2019ll host tonight? How does eating out sounds? Treat it as me apologizing to each and every one of you!\u201dSu Jing He and Fang Qing exchanged a glance. As if Su Jing He purposely did it to vex him, he warbled, \u201cI\u2019ll listen to Qing er!\u201dFang Qing beamed, \u201cThat\u2019s more like it! There\u2019s no point going to our own restaurant, so you choose a good spot! If it was the slightest bit worst, then I won\u2019t be appreciative!\u201d\u201cThat going without saying!\u201d Cui Shao Xi grinned but when he was about to name a restaurant, a delicate trill of \u2018Cousin! Cousin, are you here?\u2019 could be heard from outside. Immediately he shot up like his butt was on fire, left with \u2018Don\u2019t tell her I was here\u2019 and dashed out the back door like a streak of smoke.When Su Jing He and Fang Qing could react, Cui Shao Xi had already disappeared.The couple helplessly looked at each other. This circumstance could happen anytime as long as Cui Shao Xi came over to Su Manor. They became used to it.\u201cBrother! Sister-in-law!\u201d Su Xin er has already hurried in with eyes wandering everywhere. She asked, \u201cWhere cousin? Isn\u2019t he here?\u201d\u201cLook at you! As a girl, you\u2019re always in a hurry, not one bit like a lady!\u201d Su Jing He didn\u2019t answer her, instead held an air of a brother with a strict as he reprimanded.Su Xin er is around Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s age with an egg-shaped face, autumn water* eyes, and brows like art. It\u2019s a sweet and delicate facial feature. She\u2019s a pretty girl who was spoiled from when she was young.\u201cI\u2019m at my own home! Brother, you\u2019re so noisy. Is cousin here or not? The little maid said you and cousin came back together!\u201d How could Su Xin er actually bother with her brother\u2019s expression?Su Jing He felt powerless, and could only reply, \u201cCan you not see for yourself? He\u2019s not here! After returning to the manor, we split up!\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d Su Xin er uttered and started a monologue, \u201cThen where could he go? He neither in his yard nor at the study room. Could it be he strolling in the garden?\u201d The little girl\u2019s eye lit up. With a smile, she declared, \u201cBrother, Sister-in-law! I\u2019m leaving!\u201dShe spoke as she left like the wind.\u201cReally those two people! What should I say!\u201d Su Jing He couldn\u2019t help sighed out.Fang Qing also lightly let out a breath and expressed, \u201cLogically, there are some words I shouldn\u2019t say, but if this keeps going like this, it won\u2019t do any good for Xin er. Sooner or later, it\u2019ll harm her! When are you going to mention it to your parents and find a marriage for Xin er while it\u2019s early! Don\u2019t say I said it!\u201dIf something spread out in ill-intention, like she as a sister-in-law couldn\u2019t tolerate her husband\u2019s sister and wished her to marry out quickly, then it won\u2019t be anything good to hear.Su Jing He feebly pointed out, \u201cThat lass\u2019s eyes only have Min Zhi and won\u2019t look at anyone else! And on top of that, Father and Mother dotes her dearly and couldn\u2019t bear to go against her! Also at his side, Min Zhi also receives the same spoiling, and his parents couldn\u2019t go against his wish. Min Zhi just doesn\u2019t have her in his heart\u2013 what do you call this! Leave them be, I couldn\u2019t be bothered to deal with it!\u201dAfter a few thoughts, he added, \u201cYou also shouldn\u2019t concern yourself with it!\u201dFang Qing rolled her eyes at him, asserted, \u201cI naturally wouldn\u2019t, and it\u2019s also not up to me to. A waste of words!\u201dAt once, Su Jing He brightened up, gathered closer to Fang Qing and ambiguously nattered, \u201cSay, could it be that Min Zhi has fallen for our cousin (Fang Zhou)? I believe Min Zhi treat her differently from others!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t randomly sprout your mouth!\u201d Fang Qing rushed to voice out. \u201cIf your words were heard by Xin er, even a tiny bit, it\u2019ll ruin Fang Zhou! My Aunt and Uncle-in-law have passed. As the eldest, she still got two little brothers and one little sister under her as well as no help from anyone, her life is already pitiful enough! With Xin er\u2019s behavior, how could you not know?\u201d\u201cHer family circumstance is that tragic!\u201d Su Jing He was surprised and quickly affirmed, \u201cJust keep this talk between us. I\u2019ll be foolish if I say it outside! However, I\u2019m pretty puzzled, she and Min Zhi, how did they meet? Later on, I\u2019ll ask Min Zhi! Haha!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

De Xing\u2019s Cui FamilySeeing Fang Qing looking at him fixedly, he quickly reassured, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t let Xin er know!\u201dOnly then did Fang Qing break into a grin and let it go.At Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze\u2019s side, they had already followed Li ma to the guest rooms. Li ma politely smiled, \u201cMiss Lian and Lian gong zi will stay at these two rooms. This old servant will later let the housekeeper organize the stay at the outer courtyard for the gong zi outside. Please rest assured!\u201dThis was in the inner household, so naturally, they couldn\u2019t arrange him to come in to stay. Because Lian Ze is still small in age, otherwise he too wouldn\u2019t be able to stay here. Naturally, the outer yard has guest rooms specifically for male guests.Lian Fang Zhou nodded as smile courteously smiled, \u201cHave trouble da niang.\u00a0 Could we go and explain it to him?\u201dLi ma pondered a bit and answered, \u201cSure, this way is better! Please follow this old servant!\u201dWhen the three of them came out, Ah Jian was still calmly sitting at the side hall, resting there without a slightest sign of stress. Seeing the group come in, he stood up and headed to them with a smile.Lian Fang Zhou sent a slight smile as she lightly nodded. At this Ah Jian was relieved, and a small unexplainable part on the inside felt overjoy for her.\u201cThere\u2019s not enough time today, so we\u2019ll stay here one night. Early tomorrow, we\u2019ll then return! How about this, Ah Ze, you accompany Ah Jian!\u201dOut of a sudden, Lian Fang Zhou realized in this unknown place, letting Ah Jian stay at the outer courtyard on his own is really discourteous. Truthfully if they didn\u2019t have Ah Jian at their side on the road when the driver was scamming, she and her brother could only endure in silent.Though Lian Fang Zhou also didn\u2019t consciously notice herself but subconsciously her whole family already unknownly regarded Ah Jian as their backbone.\u201cEn! I initially wanted to tell Sister this!\u201d Lian Ze beamed as he nodded.Lian Fang Zhou looked at Li ma for permission.This was a small matter, so Li ma could decide and dipped her head as she smiled, \u201cThis way is also good! Then Miss Lian, follow this old servant back to the inner courtyard! Later, Housekeeper Su will arrange it.\u201dLian Fang Zhou uttered a sound of agreement, bid farewell to Ah Jian and Lian Ze, and followed Li ma.On the road, Li ma pointed out a lot of sights that can be seen as they pass by every scenery for Lian Fang Zhou to view. As Lian Fang Zhou look, she casually gave a few praises.Seeing her acting very polite and know the etiquette and didn\u2019t inquire about Su Family or Young Madame\u2019s matter in a roundabout way, Li ma secretly complimented, \u2018This Lian Family\u2019s Miss cousin, despite being young, isn\u2019t a troublemaker! From the look of it, she\u2019s much stronger than Young Madame\u2019s direct maternal family!\u2019The thought of Young Madame\u2019s squabbling father and vicious stepmother who wished that Young Madame could die made Li ma feel disgusted for a moment. Luckily Young Madame has some tricks, otherwise who knows what the days will become!\u201cAh!\u201d Li ma and Lian Fang Zhou was conversing when a person from their sideways suddenly called out to them. Following the sound, they looked over to see Cui Shao Xi with his hands at his back standing at the front left side fork beside a cluster of sweet osmanthus. The thick green branches and leaves were half covering and half hidden.\u201cCousin Master!\u201d Li ma hurried to bow her body in a courtesy.This Cousin Master is Su Family\u2019s esteemed guest. His mother is Master Su\u2019s legitimate younger sister, and his grandmother (from father side) is former emperor\u2019s most loved younger sister,\u00a0 Princess Yun He.And them Cui Family was from the De Xing Province and one of the top prominent family there. The previous year there was up to seventeen from the clan being a court official at the same time. All were a powerful position, with the worst was also Zhi Manor. His blood-related grandfather had a Zhuangyuan background, confer as Grand Academician of Education Hall and have previously held the position of Minister of Rites.Afterward, the former emperor passed away, Princess Yunhe couple discussed between themselves and decided to retire resolutely. They resigned and returned to their hometown in De Xing. Those within the clan took official position outside and those who were too impressive, all slowly receded.These years, they are distancing their relationship with the court and royal family on the surface. And its because they are tactful and know how to behave, the current emperor, Emperor Jian De always remember them at heart and would bestow Princess Yun He all kind of present with genuine feeling every year. Over half of De Xing\u2019s fertile land was owned by Cui Family, and their shop and business were also countless, making them their name as the number one family in the southwest true.Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t wait to get away as far as possible from this Cousin Master, but in front of Li ma, she could only follow in suit and bowed in greeting.Cui Shao Xi waved his hands at Li ma, stated, \u201cI have some words to say to Miss Lian!\u201dAlarm bells rang inside Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s mind. Afraid that Li ma would leave, she quickly smiled in politeness, \u201cSince it\u2019s like that, I\u2019ll trouble da niang to wait a bit!\u201dCui Shao Xi\u2019s gaze and expression were clearly signaling for Li ma to leave. Li ma felt \u2014 she dare not go. This Cousin Master usually handle matters in a willful way so how can he and Miss Lian be left on their own? And also, what if Young Miss saw? That\u2019s even worst! Young miss is also a wayward person, and by chance, trouble is stirred up, then everyone won\u2019t look good and it would Young Madame who looks the worst.Hearing Lian Fang Zhou said it like this, Li ma was so grateful on the inside that she didn\u2019t know how to express it. Subconsciously her brows loosened and eyes smiled as she nodded as well as taking the initiative to retreat back a few steps, spoke, \u201cOld servant will wait for Miss! Miss,\u00a0 Cousin Master, go ahead!\u201dCui Shao Xi gave Li a disgruntled stare, lightly harrumphed and didn\u2019t say anything.Lian Fang Zhou just stood there, lifted her lids to glimpse at Cui Shao Xi.\u00a0 Respectfully asked, \u201cMay I ask what Cousin Master wanted to say?\u201dCui Shao Xi saw that she didn\u2019t treat him coldly, but it was clear it was just politeness and distance. And what\u2019s more, it appeared that him calling to stop her made her somewhat unhappy. When had he ever been given the cold shoulder before?Cui Shao Xi was so angry that he wants to go crazy, but he happened to have no way of venting out the stomachful of anger.He glanced at Lian Fang Zhou, directly asked at once, \u201cWe clearly know each other, why didn\u2019t you admit in front of cousin and cousin-in-law? Does knowing this master make Miss Lian lose face?\u201dLian Fang Zhou was speechless. She mentally pondered-this cousin master is too tsundere? Just because of this, he purposely came to ask her?Then she politely explained, \u201cInitially, we don\u2019t know each other. It just a coincidence that we saw each other once on the road! Cui gong zi, your identity is valuable, while this girl is an ordinary peasant, so how could I dare say words like \u2018recognize\u2019 just because of this. If it\u2019s like that, then\u00a0 it would be Cui gong zi who lose face!\u201dCui Shao Xi heard her words and his face slightly relaxed and the anger inside immediately subsided by a half. Then laughed, \u201cI knew it. Your meaning is that you dare not be presumptuous, right? I\u2019m not so peculiar. Us Cui Family never those kinds of conceited people! In the future, you don\u2019t have to say it like that!\u201dLian Fang Zhou just wanted to get away quickly. Besides, once they left Su Family, they might not see each other again in the future. So she inclined her head, \u201cI\u2019ll remember Cui gong zi\u2019s words!\u201dImmediately Cui Shao Xi stretched out his brows, his eyes lit up like stars and on his handsome face like an ageless white jade appeared a radiant smile. It was like a splendid morning cloud, which made observing Li ma\u2019s heart skipped and secretly exclaimed about cousin master\u2019s excellent appearance, \u2018No wonder Young Miss\u2019s eyes could no longer hold anyone else, oh!\u2019Lian Fang Zhou also felt his looks are too blinding at that moment, like a beautiful peony slowly maturing to full bloom under the sun rays. She unconsciously moved her line of sight and mentally complimented, \u2018Disastrous man, don\u2019t know which girl has the fortune to catch him in the future!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Cousin and Cousin (i.e. the biao older brother and the biao younger sister)Cui Shao Xi smiled as he further questioned, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Out of nowhere, why did you suddenly thought about plant cotton? Is this your parents\u2019 idea? How come they didn\u2019t come? Aren\u2019t they worried about you and your sibling going out?\u201dAs for Ah Jian, he was automatically overlooked by him.Immediately, Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s expression became twisted but she knew he didn\u2019t do it on purpose and replied, \u201cNo particular reason, I just wanted to try.\u201dIn this world, there\u2019s a type of people who loves to put out their misfortunate wounds for everyone to see and their sympathy and compassion. There is also a type of person who refuses to be pitied and charity. Their matter should only be known and solved by themselves.Lian Fang Zhou clearly belonged to the latter, so she didn\u2019t answer Cui Shao Xi\u2019s last few questions.Cui Shao Xi wasn\u2019t someone who wants to get to the root of things. His words were just something he said without thinking, so he didn\u2019t notice that Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t answer and said, \u201cIs ten thousand liang enough? If it isn\u2019t \u2013\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s enough!\u201d Without waiting for him to finish, Lian Fang Zhou interrupted him. She politely explained, \u201cI have calculated how much money each expense would take. The land cost, hiring people, buying seeds, etc. ten thousand liang is enough\u201dCui Shao Xi could hear the displeasure carried within her words and realized that in a moment of forgetting himself, he overstepped the line. With his cheeks slightly flushed, he rushed to clarify, \u201cI, I have no other intention. Don\u2019t misunderstand!\u201dLian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t really say anything with him acting like this. The displeasure on the inside also disappeared. She smiled back, \u201cI didn\u2019t misunderstand. I know you meant well and I thank your kindness.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Cui Shao Xi let out a breath, after a short contemplation, he continued, \u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea to hire people. How about buying a few honest and hard-working ones. With the indenture in hand, it\u2019s more reliable.\u201dLian Fang Zhou initially thought like that, nodded in agreement, \u201cWhat you say is reasonable. I\u2019ll consider it.\u201dEven though cotton will definitely receive a large scale promotion within these few years, but she will do the utmost to fight for the most advantageous time as long as possible. Then as for the technique for managing the plant, she needs to keep some part confidential.Cui Shao Xi was so delighted that she agreed with him, he prepared to offer her help in choosing servants. But unexpectedly, Su Xin-er came out of nowhere and cried out \u2018cousin\u2019 in joy as she bolted over.Lian Fang Zhou was startled, raised her eyes to see a beautiful little miss dresses in a rose embroidered, pink brocade overdress with narrow sleeve and attached with cream-colored twill, pleated skirt with a lockstitch. She has a beautiful appearance, looked dainty and cute, a pair of big, bright eyes that reflect youth and ignorance, and she was smiling sweetly. That pair of eyes could only see Cui Shao Xi and did not notice her (Lian Fang Zhou) at all.Lian Fang Zhou silently retreated to the side.This little miss\u2019s identity was indirectly revealed when she uttered \u2018Cousin!\u2019. Her gaze toward Cui Shao Xi carried unconcealed fascination and deep love, making Lian Fang Zhou wishing to disappear immediately.\u201cHALT! \u201dCui Shao Xi lowly yelled. Brows slightly knitted as he stepped backward, questioned, \u201cDo you have some matters with me?\u201dFrom when her eyes first laid on Cui Shao Xi, Su Xin-er\u2019s gaze was like it was stuck to his body and could not be removed. She didn\u2019t care about his yell and refusal. From the eyes to the face it was immersed in lovestruck happiness, she tenderly smiled, \u201cCousin, where did you go? I couldn\u2019t find you anywhere!\u201dIn a split second, Cui Shao Xi\u2019s good mood fall to the rock bottom. This cousin is extremely tough to deal with. As if she could only hear her own words and other people\u2019s words, whether it was clearly stated or just a hint, it was completely disregarded.What made people even dumbfounded was previously, once she saw him, she would come up and hold his arm. Naturally, he avoided it promptly and avoided it into a sorry state. Afterward, he tactfully told her not to do that, it\u2019ll affect her reputation. Who knew, that lass couldn\u2019t hear the underlying meaning and instead said she didn\u2019t care! She doesn\u2019t care, but he does!At that time when he heard Su Xin-er\u2019s words, Cui Shao Xi\u2019s nose nearly distorted from anger.Can\u2019t talk reason with her, so he might as well don\u2019t. So from then on, when she grinned as she speed over to link with his arm, he would hastily retreat back and cried out \u2018Halt!\u2019. And she did listen.Cui Shao Xi probably didn\u2019t notice, but whatever he said, Su Xin-er would always listen.The time when Su Xin-er won\u2019t listen to him had yet to arrive. And when it does come, it\u2019ll cause him a lot of trouble.Lian Fang Zhou saw that there was no point to stay anymore, head to Li ma and quietly spoke, \u201cDa niang, let\u2019s go!\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Li ma smiled. After some thought, she felt it wasn\u2019t right to just leave like this and stepped for to bow, \u201cYoung Miss, Cousin Master, this old servant will take my leave!\u201dLian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t open her mouth, just curtsied with Li ma.Su Xin-er didn\u2019t even bother with Li ma, while Cui Shao Xi\u2019s gaze couldn\u2019t help fall onto Lian Fang Zhou. He moved his lips, wanting to press her to stay but then thought of Su Xin-er made him lose the desire. He nodded his head as he spoke, \u201cYou leave first!\u201dFollowing Cui Shao Xi\u2019s gaze, Su Xin-er only then noticed Lian Fang Zhou. The little miss\u2019s eyes immediately widened, it was full of vigilance. She bluntly grilled, \u201cWho are you? Why have I never seen you before?\u201dIn the entire manor, Su Xin-er recognized all the big and small maids for no other reason than forbidding them from getting close to Cui Shao Xi.Before when Cui Shao Xi came to Su Manor, all the big and small maids were excited. Those that actually dare have any other thoughts were very few. But it wasn\u2019t bad to have a feast for the eyes!If anyone were appointed to serve Cousin Master, even if it were just to sweep Cousin master\u2019s courtyard, they would be so thrilled that they couldn\u2019t sleep for a few nights.However, don\u2019t know when it started, but all those who served Cousin Master would suffer Young Miss\u2019s lessons without fail. Those who secretly peeked at Cousin Master and was discovered by Young Miss, had their face lacerated!Now, whenever Cui Shao Xi came to Su Manor, only footboys served at his side \u2014originally there were still ugly, old woman, however, Cui Shao Xi couldn\u2019t bear to look at them and had them sent away.As to those who sneakily look at him, only those who don\u2019t want to live dare to. When comparing eye candy and keeping their life, anyone knows how to choose.Cui Shao Xi also faintly know about these matters, and because of it, he was disgusted Su Xin-er even more. He wasn\u2019t her private property, so these actions of her made him peeved.\u201cWeren\u2019t you looking for me for something? Tell me!\u201d Seeing Su Xin-er targeting Lian Fang Zhou, Cui Shao Xi then spoke out.Su Xin-er immediately cast aside Lian Fang Zhou, looked at Cui Shao Xi with her eyes filled with love bubble. Her face also slightly blushed with abundant coyness and uttered in a gentle voice and tone, \u201cEn, I, there\u2019s no much, just, just wanted to talk with cousin. Accompany cousin to relieve boredom! Is cousin used to your stay in our manor? No need to be polite, treat it as your own home\u2026\u2026\u201dHer exhilarated heart was close to flying, as Su Xin-er kept talking endlessly! Cousin took the initiative to speak with her! Does this mean cousin is starting to accept her? Complete sincerity really can affect even metal and stone!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The farce in Ming Yue Restaurant (part 1)Lian Fang Zhou, who had already left with Li ma, heard those words of Su Xin-er, secretly felt pity for the girl. It was apparent to see that she really, really love Cui Shao Xi. Let\u2019s not mention ancient time, even in modern time, her kind of love it\u2019s not any man can bear!She felt suffocated just by observing from the side, so no need to talk about Cui Shao Xi who is directly experiencing it.Seeing Su Xin-er was chattering non-stop, Cui Shao Xi\u2019s heart was already somewhat impatient. At home, he was the favored one, so never did he go to someone and endure someone. Needless to say, he didn\u2019t want to continue bearing it.\u201cKeke!\u201d Cui Shao Xi heavily coughed a few time, interrupting Su Xin-er. Without waiting for her to open her mouth to continue, he anxiously declared, \u201cThat, I\u2019m a bit tired. I\u2019m returning to my room to rest. You should return. Don\u2019t follow! I\u2019m going. Goodbye!\u201dHe spoke as he ran like he was escaping\u201cHey!\u201d From behind Su Xin-er waved her hand and cried out a few times, but how could Cui Shao Xi bother with her? Su Xin-er was speechless. She angerly turned around, heavily stomped her legs and listlessly walked away.At the evening, dinner was at Ming Yue Restaurant. Cui Shao Xi, Su Jing He, and Su Xin-er went over first. Fang Qing led the Lian siblings and Ah Jian over later.Since Su Jing He and Fang Qing weren\u2019t eating at home, they must let Master Su and Madame Su know. This couldn\u2019t be hidden from Su Xin-er, so it was given that she would come along.Luckily outside, Su Xin-er still has some restraint and in addition to Cui Shao Xi\u2019s warning to not stick too close to him so Su Xin-er can control her leg, even if she can\u2019t control her eyes.Su Jing He, Cui Shao Xi, and Su Xin-er all came out to welcome when Fang Qing, Ah Jian, and Lian siblings arrived. Everyone mutually looked at one another, then all happily chatted as they went up to the room upstairs.Su Xin-er immediately remembered the situation earlier in the day when she saw Lian Fang Zhou. At the time she with her whole heart and eyes on Cui Shao Xi, she didn\u2019t notice but afterward, she remembered. At that time, it was clearly her conversing with cousin!She actually dared talk with cousin!\u201cWho are you? Why did you also come along?\u201d Su Xin-er immediately flared up, gave Lian Fang Zhou a hostile glare.Unaware, Lian Fang Zhou felt awkward. Lian Ze and Ah Jian barely managed to keep their expression. Fang Qing grasped her hand lightly, lightly squeeze as a sign of comfort. Cui Shao Xi\u2019s face immediately sank.\u201cXin-er! Watch your words!\u201d Su Jing He glared at Su Xin-er and said, \u201cThese are your Sister-in-law\u2019s cousins. Don\u2019t be rude!\u201dInstead of restraining herself, she curled her lips in apparent detest and said, \u201cTurned out to be relatives from Sister-in-law\u2019s side! I did say, our Su Family don\u2019t have this kind of relatives!\u201d\u201cXin-er!\u201d Su Jing He bawled with a grave face.Fang Qing used her eyes to signal to him. Then turned to Su Xin-er and said with a smile, \u201cI, your Sister-in-law, is an uneducated person from the countryside. Naturally can\u2019t compare to you!The underlying meaning was \u2018naturally my relatives naturally can\u2019t compare to your relatives, but those are still my relatives! And I am your sister-in-law.\u2019Su Xin-er froze and then immediately apologetically smiled with a reddened face, \u201cSister-in-law you know, I, I didn\u2019t mean it like that! I, I didn\u2019t look down on you\u2026\u2026\u201dFang Qing faintly smiled before saying, \u201cSister-in-law knows you lass is a straightforward person inside and out, it was only a slip of the tongue! Alright, what are we standing here drinking wind for! Let all head up first! Fang Zhou, Ah Ze, Ah Jian, let\u2019s go!\u201dFang Qing gave an apologetic smile toward the three.Normally, they should have made Su Xin-er apologize, but what kind of temperament does Su Xin-er have? Even Master Su and Madame Su can\u2019t suppress her! So if they persisted on making her apologize, it\u2019d only make everyone looking even worse.This point was not only clear to Fang Qing, Su Jing He, and Cui Shao Xi but also to the Lian Fang Zhou and the others.When Su Xin-er opened her mouth, Cui Shao Xi\u2019s face was very terrible to look at. Today it was agreed that he was the host and how Su Xin-er\u2019s act is clearly making him lose face!What does this count as? Is this entertaining guest or making people feel disgusted?\u201cRight! Right! Let\u2019s head up!\u201d Su Jing He laughed as he also help resolve the situation.Lian Fang Zhou was feeling ill at ease. The one treating was Cui Shao Xi, and if the three of the left, not only Cui Shao Xi be put in a bad spot, Fang Qing too will look bad.Lian Fang Zhou was well aware that Su Xin-er was obviously misunderstanding something. This moment was smoothed over by Fang Qing and Su Jing He, but as a spoiled lady with such a headstrong temper that she couldn\u2019t be reason with, heaven knows what kind of conflict will emerge afterward.If by chance, the problematic factor, Cui Shao Xi couldn\u2019t overlook it and help say a few words, then it\u2019ll be like poking a nest of wasps; no peace at all!Leave, not possible; stay, not a good idea!What to do?An idea came to Lian Fang Zhou. She purposely cried out as leaned toward Ah Jian. Ah Jian quickly reached out to hold her, asked in concern, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dCui Shao Xi couldn\u2019t help but glance at the hand that Ah Jian used to support Lian Fang Zhou. It was really hurting the eyes. He also rushed to enquired, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, just carelessly twisted my ankle!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou ruefully smiled. While the people were offguard, she swiftly glared at Cui Shao Xi.\u201cSister, Brother Ah Jian and I will support you!\u201d Cui Shao Xi froze before he was wordlessly elbowed away to the side by Lian Ze.\u201cAll cause I was careless. It\u2019s just a small matter, there\u2019s no harm. Let\u2019s go!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled toward everyone.Witnessing the intimate interaction between Ah Jian and Lian Fang Zhou, the knot in Su Xin-er\u2019s heart loosened up, and she smiled like a blooming flower. To curry her sister-in-law\u2019s favor, she asked with a face full of delight, \u201cIs it really not serious? How about inviting a doctor?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! I\u2019ll go get someone to invite one!\u201d Hearing Su Xin-er spoke like that, Su Jing He instantly felt much satisfied and thought \u2018Little sis can also be a decent person!\u2019 Then fawningly glanced at his wife.Fang Qing ad the impulse to hold her head. No wonder this pair of siblings are from the same womb. What do you call this! She twisted her ankle, and you guys think it\u2019ll get better just by inviting a doctor. Also, why are you speaking with such an overjoyed expression?Thankfully, Lian Fang Zhou was acting! Otherwise, what would she think?Fang Qing swept a glimpse at Lian Fang Zhou, approvingly thought, \u2018A smart girl!\u2019Smart, understanding, courteous, and look at the bigger picture. Really not simple!\u201cI\u2019m alright, it\u2019ll be better with some rest! No need to go to so much trouble!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou just smiled.Su Jing He still wanted to say more, but Fang Qing spoke out, \u201cFang Zhou isn\u2019t an outsider. She said no need then there is no need! Fang Zhou, if you need anything, no need to be polite!\u201dTheir gaze met, wordlessly communicate with each other.Lian Fang Zhou grinned and nodded her head in answer.Due to everyone going upstairs and the narrow stairs don\u2019t allow three people to walk side by side, Lian Ze lurched a step and followed behind, letting Ah Jian support Lian Fang Zhou.Seeing this, Cui Shao Xi felt more depressed on the inside.Once they entered the room, everyone sat on the chairs near the wall. The staff poured out the tea and asked if they want the food to be served. Cui Shao Xi dipped his head, waved a hand to signal him to go and prepared himself as he called everyone to sit over at the table.Su Xin-er followed straight behind Cui Shao Xi. Her intention was obviously wanting to wait until Cui Shao Xi sit before she sits. However, Cui Shao Xi was going to and fro as he entertained everyone. He was delaying to take a seat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The farce in Ming Yue Restaurant (part 2)Towards the Su Xin-er who was shadowing behind him, he acted as if he didn\u2019t know. Anyhow, he doesn\u2019t have eyes at the back of his head.Today, Cui Shao Xi was furious at Su Xin-er. This lass doesn\u2019t care about the surrounding when flaring up and don\u2019t think before she speaks.Fang Qing couple was conversing with Lian Fang Zhou and Ah Jian when Fang Qing glanced to see Su Xin-er acting like that. She then lightly pinched Su Jing He under the table and signaled at him with her eyes.Only then did Su Jing He noticed what his sister was doing. His face reddened and bitterly thought, \u2018this sister is too embarrassing ah!\u2019Even in the most ludicrous moment of his past, he never acted like his sister when chasing after girls.\u201cXin-er, come, sit next to your Sister-in-law! You\u2019re not the one treating today, so what are mixing around for!\u201d Su Jing He pointedly looked at Su Xin-er.Lian Fang Zhou and the other two pretended not to see or hear.All three of them had the same thought, \u2018If I knew earlier this dinner would be like this, I would have found an excuse to decline and not come.\u2019\u201cXin-er, quickly come over! I left a space for you!\u201d Fang Qing beckoned Su Xin-er with her hands.Su Xin-er pouted, looked over at the spot between Fang Qing and Lian Fang Zhou. With no choice, she went to sit.Now there are only two empty seats left. If she doesn\u2019t sit there, then cousin will sit next to Lian Fang Zhou and Sister-in-law. She was firmly against that.Seeing Ah Jian sitting on the other side of Lian Fang Zhou, her heart then felt slightly better.Cui Shao Xi called for the staff to come in again and gave him few instruction. Only then did he finally sat down.At the moment, only half of the dishes were brought over. From the looks of it, it\u2019ll need to take a while longer. So everyone casually chatted around.Unexpectedly, Su Xin-er grinned at Lian Fang Zhou, asked, \u201cMiss Lian, are you engaged yet? This sir, Ah Jian, should be Miss Lian\u2019s fiance? You two are well matched!\u201dEveryone happened to freeze. The room had fallen into silence at once.Su Jing He\u2019s facial expression was terrible. \u2018She, an unmarried and yet-to-be engaged girl, to actually say such words in front of this many people!?\u2019Lian Fang Zhou and Ah Jian subconsciously looked at each other. Both of them were a bit embarrassed, they never thought Su Xin-er would ask such questions.She questioned like that, now how is she to answer?Cui Shao Xi\u2019s face blackened and sunk. Also, with the same terrible expression was Lian Ze. He wanted to speak out but halted by Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s eye signal: At any rate, must give some respect for Fang Qing\u2019s feeling.\u201cJust said you were straightforward. Oh, this mouth of yours, really makes one don\u2019t know whether to love or hate!\u201d Fang Qing started laughing, pinched Su Xin-er\u2019s cheeks and said in a very intimate tone as if she was joking, vaguely skipped this topic.But Su Xin-er wasn\u2019t appreciative. She spoiled uttered \u2018Sister-in-law!\u2019, turned her head to escape Fang Qing\u2019s hand and her eyes focused on Lian Fang Zhou. She kept on grilling, \u201cMiss Lian, you haven\u2019t answered me yet!\u201dShe was obviously wanting Lian Fang Zhou to give a clear answer.No matter how good Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s temperament was, she still felt somewhat infuriated. Did nobody ever teach this young miss how to act like a person?Just when she was about to open her mouth to talk back in not gentle nor rough manner at her, Ah Jian responded out of nowhere, \u201cMiss Su has a sharp eye! Really knows how to talk!\u201dAh Jian said it very politely and within that politeness was frankness, making anyone who heard it, not feels disgusted. But those two phrases itself was very pawky*.However, Su Xin-er didn\u2019t care about this. Her face immediately filled with jolly, and merrily blurted, \u201cSo it\u2019s true! Congratulations you two! When are you two marrying? Don\u2019t forget to send us invitations. I will send you an enormous gift! You are my Sister-in-law\u2019s relatives, after all!\u201d\u201cMany thanks, Miss Su!\u201d Ah Jian replied with a smile.Image result for \u00e5\u2020\u00ac\u00e7\u201c\u0153\u00e9\u00b3\u2013\u00e8\u00a3\u2122\u00e7\u00be\u00b9White gourd and calipash soup.Recipe in Chinese- https://www.meishij.net/china-food/caixi/hubeicai/130558.html(I can\u2019t guarantee the validity of it since I never had it before)Precisely then the staff pushed the door and came in carrying tray. The tray contained a giant bowl of the white gourd and calipash* soup. The staff smile as he dipped his head, affirmed, \u201cThe dishes are all served. Guests, please enjoy your meal!\u201dSu Jing He and Fang Qing then busily urged and merrily invited everyone to taste. Fang Qing\u2019s apologetic gaze had landed on Lian Fang Zhou and Ah Jian countless times.Only now did Su Xin-er really rest her mind. With a brilliant smile, she turned to watch Cui Shao Xi. Cui Shao Xi didn\u2019t even bat an eyelid at herAlthough Su Xin-er felt disappointed, she immediately found an appropriate reason for Cui Shao Xi, \u2018Cousin is being bashful! When outside, cousin is usually conscious of his dignity!\u2019Seeing Su Xin-er stop, everyone all let out a giant breath out. Cui Shao Xi, Su Jing He, and Fang Qing were very polite as well as informal\u2013 Fang Qing is relatives, so that goes without saying, while both Cui Shao Xi and Su Jing He wasn\u2019t so fussy. Soon the atmosphere became more lively.Only it seems like Cui Shao Xi was being very snug to Ah Jian. He kept on giving a toast to Ah Jian, and Ah Jian doesn\u2019t refuse, accepted one after another.Gradually, everyone noticed something was strange. Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t help say to Ah Jian, \u201cDrink less. Tomorrow we have to travel early in the morning.\u201dWhen Cui Shao Xi heard these words, he felt even more downhearted. \u2018Clearly, two people were drinking, and she only dissuaded Ah Jian while overlooking him. Is he that, unlikeable?\u2019Actually, Cui Shao Xi was really making things hard for Lian Fang Zhou! Unless Lian Fang Zhou went mad, she wouldn\u2019t go provoke him.\u201cWhat is there to be afraid of!\u201d Cui Shao Xi slapped the table. He slightly wobbled as he stood up with a huge grin. A cup in one hand and a pot in the other, his eyes stared straight at Ah Jian and beckoned, \u201cCome, let\u2019s, continue, drinking! Not drunk, then not allowed to return!\u201d\u201cCousin, don\u2019t drink anymore! You\u2019re drunk!\u201d Su Xin-er solicitously expressed as she stood up to go over to support Cui Shao Xi.\u201cHalt!\u201d Cui Shao Xi glared at her. \u201cStay there!\u201d\u201cThen you got to promise me you won\u2019t drink! If you become drunk, then you\u2019ll suffer a lot! You\u2019ll get a headache!\u201d Su Xin-er pouted her mouth.Lian Fang Zhou thought, \u2018Acting up again. Don\u2019t know how we\u2019ll end it this time. \u2018 So she looked at everyone, then spoke, \u201cI say we\u2019re about done, how about going back?\u201dThis was what Su Jing He and Fang Qing wished for and instantly agreed. Su Jing He called for staff to come and instructed them to bring in their servants. Almost forcefully supporting Cui Shao Xi down the stair.Like a tail, Su Xin-er followed behind. She continuously ordered the boys to \u2018be careful!\u2019 and \u2018pay attention!\u2019\u201cHave a good rest tonight. I\u2019ll have everything properly arranged for tomorrow. And also that ten thousand liang, I\u2019ll get ready as well.\u201d Inside the carriage, Fang Qing informed Lian Fang Zhou.\u201cMany thanks, Cousin! I will definitely return the money to Cousin!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou grateful promised\u201cYou don\u2019t always have to keep this matter in mind. I believe your words! That year Aunt has shown me kindness and were close sisters with my mother. So we should also be intimate as well! In the future, when there are problems, you can come to look for me!\u201d Fang Qing smiled.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll thank Cousin now!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou gratefully said.\u201cWe\u2019re family, no need to be courteous!\u201d The two of them looked at each other with grins.On the whole road, the two of them happily conversed, mutually understood not to mention Su Xin-er at all.The carriage reached the inner entrance, and everyone got off. Lian Fang Zhou will have to follow Fang Qing couple and Su Xin-er to the inner courtyard. Cui Shao Xi has his own yard in the outer courtyard. Lian Ze and Ah Jian will go with him to the guest rooms in the outer courtyard.Lian Fang Zhou walked a few steps to go to Ah Jian and Lian Ze\u2019s side. To Ah Jian, she smiled, and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m very thankful that you save us from embarrassment tonight!\u201dPawky: Scottish word for sardonic sense of humorCalipash: the fatty gelatinous dull-greenish substance found under the upper shell of a turtle and esteemed as a delicacyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Stopped again\u201cYour welcome!\u201d Ah Jian gave a grin.Lian Fang Zhou inclined her head, said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll go in first. Ah Ze, take good care of your Brother Ah Jian. He drank a lot tonight!\u201d\u201cRest assured Sister!\u201d Lian Ze responded.Only then did Lian Fang Zhou went with Fang Qing and the others.With that matter at Ming Yue Restaurant, no matter if it\u2019s real or fake, both Lian Ze and Ah Jian would now keep on feeling awkward when they interact with each other on their own. So Lian Fang Zhou must come over and say a few words in front of both of them to fix tonight\u2019s matter. This way, the two of them won\u2019t feel uncomfortable.After she said these words, it can be seen the two of them let out a breath, loosening up.At the time when coming back, Su Xin-er was resolute on using the same carriage as Cui Shao Xi. Su Jing He had no choice but to accompany her. Now at his moment, Su Xin-er insisted that she was worried about the drunk Cui Shao Xi and wanted to send him back to his yard to rest, then leave. But was dragged away by Su Jing He, who refuse to listen to her explanations.Although Cui Shao Xi was a bit drunk, it definitely wasn\u2019t to the point he displayed out. It was apparent that he pretended to lose his conscious to escape that lass. Only the lass was tactless and wanted to approach closer.Leaving aside that, but is this what a girl would do? Sending a man back to his yard late in the evening? Let\u2019s not mentioned cousin, even if it\u2019s biological brother, you\u2019ll need to avert suspicion.Therefore, only Fang Qing and Lian Fang Zhou were left trailing behind.After entering the inner courtyard, they reached a fork, and the cousins exchanged farewell and separated.Fang Qing returned to her own yard, where Li ma quickly greeted with \u2018Young Madame have returned!\u2019 and waited upon her for changing and washing up with Shuang Ling and Shuang Xiu. When she just about finished, Su Jing He casually strolled in as he still kept on mumbling.Fang Qing shot him a glance, asked, \u201cSent back?\u201d\u201cSimply outrageous!\u201d Su Jing He was infuriated.He stuck to Fang Qing as he sat down, irritatedly criticized, \u201cThat lass has gone mad! In my opinion, we need to tell Min zi not to come to our house until she married out. This saves us all the embarrassment!\u201dBeing perceptive, Li ma retreated with the maids in tow.Fang Qing remarked, \u201cThink about it yourself, how long since Min Zhi last came over? You think he wants to! If this time there weren\u2019t a matter to do, he wouldn\u2019t have come!\u201d\u201cNow that you say it, it\u2019s true!\u201d Su Jing He slightly raised his head in contemplation and spoke. Then said with irk, \u201cThat lass should really be married off. If it keeps continuing, sooner or later, it\u2019ll cause mayhem!\u201d\u201cCome on! She\u2019s not happy, how could Father and Mother bear to force her to marry? For her to be satisfied, besides Min Zhi, who else can do?\u201d Fang Qing rolled her eyes.Su Jing concluded it was really like that after some thoughts. He can\u2019t help and frustratedly utter, \u201cThen there\u2019s no solution and leave her be?\u201d\u201cYou can try getting Min Zhi married first!\u201d Fang Qing observed him as she suggested.\u201cThat\u2019s right! Why didn\u2019t I thought of it!\u201d Su Jing He became overjoyed, clapped his hand and grinned, \u201cEven if she doesn\u2019t want, she\u2019ll have to give up when Min Zhi married!\u201dAfter saying, he let out a sighed, said, \u201cMin Zhi has set his eyes high. Afraid it won\u2019t be easy to find a wife! What you say is right. I\u2019m not boasting, Xin-er isn\u2019t bad. Take her appearance and family status, which part doesn\u2019t match Min Zhi? And besides, it would be family becoming even closer! More importantly, she is dead set on Min Zhi! Say, why doesn\u2019t Min Zhi like her?\u201dFang Qing responded, \u201cTo think you were a man, to not even understand such a simple logic! Men ah, are despicable. The more you are set on him, be obedient and infatuated, the more he won\u2019t place any importance on you! Had to persist on looking for scolding and whipping, to like it a lot and then put the person in their heart! Xin-er suffers cause of the disadvantage of her obsession.\u201dSu Jing He opened his word, but no words come out. His gaze on Fang Qing was strange\u2013 These words sound like how, cough! Definitely not talking about him! Definitely not!\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d Fang Qing saw his weird gaze.Su Jing He was extremely depressed. His heart was still too fragile, as he couldn\u2019t help finally asked, \u201cThen, you, you really think like that?\u201d\u201cThink like what?\u201d\u201cSaying men were\u2026 despicable. Those words.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not what I think. It\u2019s the truth!\u201d\u201cBack, back then you toward me\u2026 You, you also\u2026 thought like that?\u201d Su Jing He\u2019s heart filled with melancholy.Fang Qing paused. Only then she realized her words apparently accidentally pierce him just now. She restrained her laughter, shook her head, and stated, \u201cYou\u2019re different.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Su Jing He\u2019s spirit revitalized and immediately became interested. He approached her and firmly stuck to her, grinned, \u201cHow am I different?\u201dNot only was Su Jing He was interested, but he was also smug. After all, it\u2019s his wife. In his wife\u2019s eye, naturally, he\u2019s different!Fang Qing glimpsed at him, snickered as she spoke, \u201cThe you that year, you still dare mention! I\u2019m embarrassed to even speak of it!\u201dSu Jing He\u2019s handsome face instantly collapsed. Remembering that he himself that year, was really useless\u2013 Or should be said, he didn\u2019t find the word \u2018useless.\u2019 But she can\u2019t say it like that.Immediately, Su Jing He was enraged, fiercely glared at Fang Qing, said, \u201cDare to laugh at your husband. Your courage has grown! Wait til I punish you later!\u201dFang Qing blushed, lightly spat and turned her head away slightly. This teased Su Jing He, making his heart itched and couldn\u2019t resist hugging into his own embrace, He spoke a massive pile of shameless nonsense, turning Fang Qing\u2019s pretty face completely red, her watery eyes bright and overflow with a peachy glow.Su Jing He loved that so much he doesn\u2019t know what to do. He passionately kissed her a few times on the face, whispered to her ears, \u201cI\u2019m going to bath. Obediently return to our room and wait for me\u2026\u201dEarly the second day, Lian Fang Zhou had woken up really early. The little serving maid who was sleeping in the outer room, Zao Hua have already woke up and heard movement, entered and greeted with a smile, \u2018Morning Miss Lian!\u2019After some small talks, she went to fetch hot water and prepared blue salt to wait upon Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s freshening up.Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t need her assistance. After the water came, she smiled as she gave her thanks, then agilely washed up. Zao Hua saw that she really didn\u2019t need her, then courteously smiled as she stood at the side waiting to serve and conversed with her.Not long later, Li ma came over again, inviting Lian Fang Zhou over to Fang Qing\u2019s place.The two of them chatted as they made their way, not expecting Cui Shao Xi to pop up and blocked the road suddenly.Li ma was so startled that her heart nearly thumped out of her throat and her legs trembled so much that she almost fell. \u2018Master cousin, what do you want to do!\u2019Li ma wasn\u2019t clear about what happened last night, but she did hear Su Jing He and Fang Qing talked a bit about it.To astute old people like her, hearing a few sentences is enough to guess what happened. At least master implied meaning won\u2019t be wrong.Lian Fang Zhou felt a moment of helplessness. This person was really\u2014 what does he want to say this time!Cui Shao Xi stared at Li ma, toward the side, he faintly moved his mouth. Li ma was helpless, could only bow and silently retreat back a few steps.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Leaving\u201cWas last night words true?\u201d Cui Shao Xi softly asked Lian Fang Zhou.\u201cWhat words?\u201dLian Fang Zhou responded with a blanked face. What exactly is he asking out of nowhere? Is he not fully awake?\u201cHaha!\u201dCui Shao Xi burst into laughter. In a more joyous tone, he exclaimed, \u201cI understand! You go, then!\u201d\u201cHa?\u201dLian Fang Zhou paused. However, since he let her go, she\u2019ll definitely won\u2019t stay. So she inclined her head as she took her leave and went with Li ma.Only now did Li ma let out a breath and relaxed as her expression loosen up.When Lian Fang Zhou arrived at Fang Qing\u2019s courtyard, Su Jing He already went to do who knows what, leaving only Fang Qing there.Fang Qing who saw her come, very politely smiled as she greeted and instructed the maids to bring over the breakfast. With a smile, she spoke, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you like, so I had prepared a few more different stuff! At Ah Ze and Ah Jian side, I have already ordered someone send it over! You ah, peacefully eat with me! I already got someone to prepare the carriage. Guaranteed not to delay your matter!\u201dThis made them both burst in peals of laughter.\u201cCousin, I have bothered you a lot!\u201dLian Fang Zhou smiled.\u201cDon\u2019t say it like that!\u201dFang Qing waved her hands, pulled her to sit.Image result for \u00e9\u00a9\u00ac\u00e8\u00b9\u201e\u00e7\u00b3\u2022Osmanthus water chestnut cakeIn front on the green floral cloth covered round table, porridge selection and over ten different kinds of snack were spread out. There were some Lian Fang Zhou recognize and others she doesn\u2019t. The set of white porcelain ware holding it was very refined.Lian Fang Zhou chose half bowl black rice porridge. Fang Qing used the public chopstick, picked yolk & pumpkin biscuit, orange osmanthus & water chestnut cake, wolfiporia cocos slice, steamed dumpling with pheasant meat filling and pancake with roe deer meat filling for her to try, benevolently smiled, \u201cI don\u2019t know what taste Qing-er and Che-er likes, so I got them to pack two boxes to bring back for them to try!\u201dThis was Fang Qing\u2019s consideration, Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t really refuse and thanked her with a smile.After having breakfast, rinsed mouth and casually sat for a while, Lian Fang Zhou then stood to take her leave.Fang Qing didn\u2019t ask her to stay. She counted the ten thousand liang of notes in front of her clearly, separated into two envelopes and passed it to her. She smiled, \u201cI\u2019m handing this to you. Next year I want to see a great change from you!\u201d\u201cMany thanks for Cousin\u2019s blessing!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou was slightly hesitant, then asked, \u201cCousin, should I leave an IOU\u2026\u201dImage result for \u00e8\u0152\u00af\u00e8\u2039\u201c\u00e8\u2013\u201e\u00e9\u00a5\u00bcWolfiporia cocos slice(Not too confident on the picture accuracy)Not waiting for her to finish, Fang Qing fiercely stared at her and interrupted, \u201cWhat IOU, I trust you!\u201dLian Fang Zhou smiled, and no longer mention this matter.She trusted her to definitely payback. It was rare for Fang Qing to believe in her, so why would she break that trust?Fang Qing led her again to the table in the side hall, pointed to the pile of securely packed bundles and box and informed. \u201cBesides the two boxes of pastries, there\u2019s also cloth and a few pelts. New Year nearly here, I didn\u2019t gift you much. Take them and turn them to clothes for the New Year. It\u2019s better than buying from outside.\u201dShe said as she received a delicate elongated scarlet box from Li ma, lightly opened it and inside was cushioned with a bright red soft silk. On top rest a pair of golden hairpins with the design on the tip couldn\u2019t be discerned, one encrusted with pearl and the other inlaid with a ruby. With one look, you can tell they are valuable items.Lian Fang Zhou was shocked, not waiting for Fang Qing to open her mouth, she immediately declined, \u201cCousin, the is too precious. I can\u2019t accept it! And also there\u2019s no place to wear it to in the countryside!\u201d\u201cThen, leave it as dowry!\u201d Fang Qing persisted, closed the case and stuffed it into her hands. She grasped her hands and lightly sighed. \u201d This isn\u2019t just my idea, it\u2019s also your cousin-in-law. Last night, oh, I\u2019m embarrassed to mention it! Xin-er has that kind of temper, so don\u2019t take offense! These two items consider them an apology! If you\u2019re not willing, our hearts will feel guilty!\u201dSince Fang Qing said it like that, then even more reason to not accept, she affirmed with a smile, \u201cCousin you also say Miss Su temperament is like that, that implies she words weren\u2019t on purpose. I really don\u2019t blame her a single bit!\u201dFang Qing tried to persuade for the third time. Lian Fang Zhou still won\u2019t budge, leaving Fang Qing helpless and couldn\u2019t only let it drop. Then she personally sent her to the inner entrance, lamented, \u201cWhen will you have free time and come over to for a visit? Next time bring Qing-er and Che-er to stay over for a few days! We can have a good long talk!\u201dNaturally, Lian Fang Zhou agreed. With Lian Ze and Ah Jian, she bid Fang Qing farewell and entered the carriage.Image result for \u00e5\u00b0\u00e7\u00ac\u00bc\u00e5\u0152\u2026\u00e5Steamed dumplingFang Qing watched the carriage leave, declared \u2018let\u2019s return\u2019 and turned to go back.Li ma supported her hand, remarked, \u201cThis Miss Lian isn\u2019t bad! Lian gongzi and that Ah Jian is also good!\u201dFang Qing glanced at Li ma, \u201cIsn\u2019t that right! Much better than my own maternal family!\u201dLi ma, didn\u2019t respond, instantly just appropriately smiled, \u201cYoung Madame\u2019s mouth really don\u2019t hide words!\u201dFang Qing smiled, \u201cWhat is there to hide? Who doesn\u2019t know? This cousin of mine isn\u2019t a simple person!\u201dLi ma then said, \u201cOh, if we are talking not simple, old servant believe Young Madame is number one.\u201dFang Qing smiled, lightly spoke, \u201cIn future, you\u2019ll if I spoke right or not!\u201dSu Family\u2019s carriage is quite exquisite. Sitting inside, one can\u2019t feel any jolting. It was really soft and comfortable, and the horse pulling the carriage was excellent quality. With a quick horse and light carriage, a familiar scenery entered into view when the curtain was raised, within a half-day effort. Not much longer, they\u2019ll enter the village.The three of them were extremely thrilled.Lian Ze was still pining on being able to enter the mountain to make charcoal in the afternoon!The carriage turned on a bend, and at once, a showy sound of beating drums and blowing trumpets emerged. Each note connected and become a piece of music that carries joy\u2013 there is someone who was marrying.As long as one meets with an oncoming red or white occasion (i.e red wedding, white funeral), it was established to yield to them. So that why the driver automatically drove to one side to steer clear without waiting for Lian Fang Zhou and the others to say anything.The joyous music became louder and louder. The group of colorfully dressed marriage escorts also got closer and closer. Seeing the man dressed in all red on the horse in front of the bright red bridal sedan, \u201cLian Fang Zhou uttered \u2018ah\u2019 and hit her head. She exclaimed with a smile, \u201cSo it\u2019s him marrying today. I nearly forgot!\u201dOn the horse was her ex-fiance. Yang Huai Shan.Image result for \u00e8\u201a\u2030\u00e9\u00a6\u2026\u00e9\u00a5\u00bcMeat filling pancakeToday Hua Family\u2019s daughter was getting married. Hua Family\u2019s women had long already made a lot of fanfare about it to make it known to the world. Hua Family\u2019s daughter-in-law even purposely ran over to Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s entrance to clamor. The three Lian siblings and Third Aunt were exasperated. Third Aunt had wanted to dash out and argue with them but was stopped by Lian Fang Zhou.Instead, Lian Fang Zhou was steady and calm. She has no feeling for Yang Huai Shan\u2019s whole family, and even if she did for a tiny bit, the two families have already broken the engagement. Meaning it got nothing to do with each other who they marry. So, in other word, sooner or later, Yang Huai Shan will marry, what does she have to mope about?Hua Gamily was really bored. She has no energy to accompany them in their ruckus. She still needs to earn money and become well off.Lian Ze, who was at the side feeling extremely anxious on inside when he saw Lian Fang Zhou picked up a corner of the carriage curtain to peer outside, scowled his face and called out, \u201cWhat is there to see? Don\u2019t watch sister!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And also really extravagant!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou jollily commented and put down the curtain.Lian Ze gave a low snort, declared, \u201cIn future, when Sister marry, it\u2019ll definitely be more lively and more extravagant!\u201dThanks to Hua Family women\u2019s haughty big mouth, Ah Jian also knew a little about the matter. He stated, \u201cAh Ze is right. Yang Family don\u2019t want you is because they have no eyes. They can\u2019t match up to you! A better man will definitely marry you!\u201d\u201cBrother Ah Jian is most certainly correct!\u201d Lian Ze beamed.Lian Fang Zhou felt warmed up on the inside, faintly smiledActually, she had already prepared to not marry at all this lifetime. She has siblings that need to take care of, and also she had an engagement broken off. When her siblings all grown up, her age will be pretty high. How many people would be willing to marry her? Want her to make do? Not possible!So because of that, she had no misgiving when she fell toward Ah Jian in Ming Yue Restaurant last night. Anyway, she doesn\u2019t plan on marrying, so why have misgiving?The distinct horn blares passed by. The bridal procession\u2019s footsteps, peals of chatter and laughter acutely sounded out from the obstructing, thin curtain. The entertaining group had passed, and Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t resist curiosity and lift opened the curtain, put out her head to have a glance.Somehow, the groom on horseback in front suddenly turned his head around at that moment. With no chance of hiding, Lian Fang Zhou straightforwardly met up with his gaze.Both of them froze.Startled, Lian Fang Zhou hurriedly withdrew her neck. Yang Huai Shan\u2019s mind buzzed, his chest was like it was heavily hammering. \u2018It\u2019s her! It\u2019s really her!\u2019Today, he came to welcome the bride. His eyes unconsciously wondered around the crowd, planning on finding her figure. But it wasn\u2019t there. Not only was her silhouette not there, but even her siblings were also not there either. He was secretly depressed. Presumably, she was crying at home now? It\u2019s all his fault, having no courage to fight until the end. In the end, he married someone else. He wronged her!He never thought he would see her at this moment!So previously she wasn\u2019t at home! They still have a great fate, no? Otherwise, how else did they bump into each other at the last minute?A strange excitement emerged within Yang Huai Shan. It was a euphoric feeling. His chest cavity was dominated by this weird feeling, became overflowed with it and his brain overheated. He subconsciously pulled the reins, then turned around to head over to her!\u201cNew Son-in-law, why did you stop! Quick go, quickly go wa! Don\u2019t miss the auspicious time ah, it\u2019ll be unlucky!\u201dIn a complete gaudy red clothing, a matchmaker with a round bun garnished with two large red flowers, smilingly looked at him.Yang Huai Shan heart cooled down, instantly became a bit more clear-headed.He raised his eyes to look again, the carriage she was in had already slowly moved. Not long later, it disappeared from sight.Yang Huai\u00a0 Shan secretly sighed, with no other choice, he turned around and continued forward. The joyous music in his ears and the crowds\u2019 merry suddenly become faint as if it was far away from him,\u00a0 far away\u2026The carriage was swift. Not a moment later, it had reached Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s homeThird Aunt, Lian Che, and Lian Fang Qing, who were within the house, heard the movement, lifted up their head and saw the three of them getting off the carriage. All three faces\u2019 displayed delight and went to welcome them. Lian Fang Qing cried out in rejoice, \u2018Sister! Second Brother! Brother Ah Jian!\u2019 and dashed out to the most front.Lian Fang Zhou opened wide her arms, hugged Lian Fang Qing who dived into her embrace with a grin. She endearingly asked, \u201cDid you miss Sister?\u201d\u201cEn! When Sister wasn\u2019t home, I couldn\u2019t sleep last night!\u201d Lian Fang Qing looked up, continuously nodded, and pouted her mouth as she replied.\u201cSister also missed you all! It\u2019s still my Qing-er, who love Sister the most!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled as she pinched her cheeks. She cheerfully greeted Third Aunt and Lian Che.\u201cOh, there\u2019s this many presents! I\u2019ll do it!\u201d Third Aunt saw Ah Jian and Lian Ze carried down the parcels and boxes from the carriage, and her eyes lit up, reached out her hands to take it.Lian Fang Zhou held Lian Fang Qing, called out to that driver. \u201cI have troubled Big Brother! Come inside, have some tea! Our place is simple, so there\u2019s not much good stuff to serve. Do forgive us!\u201dHow could the driver look upon their home? He was anxious to get back, so he patted the water bag at his side, smiled, \u201cI still have water here, so won\u2019t delay stay! Miss Lian, no need to be polite! This one will take my leave!\u201dSeeing the situation, Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t really force the other person. She inclined her head and smiled, \u201cSince it\u2019s like that, I won\u2019t make you stay!\u201dAs she spoke, she dug out loose silver which was around three-four coin, stepped forward and handed to the driver. She said, \u201cThe journey was strenuous, here\u2019s some money for you to buy a pot of spirit\u00a0 to drink and warm up!\u201dThe driver faintly paused, obviously didn\u2019t expect that Lian Fang Zhou would reward him. Immediately he felt a bit embarrassed, somewhat pretend to refuse, then just accept it. He apologetically smiled, \u201cMany thanks, Miss! Miss, please return, this one will take my leave now!\u201dLian Fang Zhou smiled, watched him turned around to leave, and just entered the house with Ah Jian and Lian Ze.\u201cHow much did you give him just now?\u201d Third Aunt saw that Lian Fang Zhou gave silver nuggets rather than copper coins, her heart ached. She moved closer, continuously asked a series of questions, \u201cDid you see your cousin? Were you able to borrow money? What was Su Family like? Are they exceptionally wealthy?\u201dLian Fang Zhou just voiced out, \u201cLet\u2019s go inside first! We\u2019ll slowly discuss it later!\u201dApparently, Third Aunt was dissatisfied with Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s response, grumbled with the desire to say more. Lian Ze then indicated, \u201cThird Aunt, Cousin Fang send a lot of presents!\u201d\u201cAiya, I need to go see. Those two little ones better not randomly open and waste the things!\u201d Third Aunt rushed inside.Just now, Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che had carried in some present inside.Lian Fang Zhou chuckled, \u201cLet\u2019s also go in!\u201dThe things that were brought back were piled on the table. Third Aunt rubbed this, rubbed that as she mumbled, \u201cThe prominent households are not the same! Just the look of the boxes is gorgeous! I wonder what these are! Fang Zhou, I can open it?\u201dUsually, Third Aunt was noisy and dared say anything, but on the inside, she had long been afraid of Lian Fang Zhou. Without Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s word, she dare not touch.\u201cOpen it then! Cousin said they\u2019re clothing material. That\u2019s right, there are also two boxes of snacks!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou said.With those words, Third Aunt uttered \u2018oh\u2019 and with Lian Fang Qing, she started opening them. Lan Fang Zhou also helped out on the side. Soon the few boxes and parcel were all opened.\u201cReally are fabric materials. So thick and solid, yi!\u00a0 Here\u2019s some\u00a0 pelt!\u201d Third Aunt was surprised and delighted. Grasped within her hands were silvery grey and brown pelts.\u00a0 She carefully felt them and then felt the rest. Grinning, she listed, \u201cErmine, Eurasian Squirrels, angora, cashmere wool. Oh, we won\u2019t have to worry about winter, when we used these for layered clothes and sleeveless jacket!\u201d\u201cWhat are these here? It\u2019s so soft!\u201d Lian Fang Qing\u2019s held a bolt of dull bean green material with embroidered entwined branch pattern as she questioned.Lian Fang Zhou and Third Aunt also felt it. Third Aunt exclaimed in amazement, \u201cIt really is! This material is so thick and solid. What is inside? Why is it so soft?\u201dLian Fang Zhou\u2019s first thought was cotton but after a second thought \u2013Not possible ah!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Reed flowers?\u201d Her mind moved and inserted, \u201cShould be silk!\u201d\u201cRight, right, right! It is silk! \u201d Third Aunt couldn\u2019t resist rubbing it. She enviably sighed, \u201cLong heard that rich people\u2019s winter quilt are out of silk and besides the different kinds and type of fur clothes, there\u2019s also cut out from embroidered embossed silk filled with woolen material. Just never seen it before. So this is what it looks like! Aiya, just looking at it I can feel the warmth! So light and soft! Those rich people really know how to enjoy!\u201dLian Fang Zhou took a glimpse. Besides the five pieces of fur, this stuffed silk, thick clothing material had a bolt of light blue, a bolt of dark blue, a bolt of lilac as well as that bolt (under Third Aunt\u2019s hand). All had dark embroidery design, the embroidered threads were closely pressed together. She smiled, \u201cAs it happens, it\u2019s about to Year-end. It\u2019s perfect to use it to cut out some winter clothes! Cousin Fang Qing had it all well thought out!\u201dImage result for longevity lock in ancient chinaLock Charm in Ancient China*Wiki got a great explanation on the locks and its symbolismBesides these materials, there were also five-six pieces of headwear, few handkerchiefs, and some exquisite purse. Quite appropriate for the rural area people to use. In addition, there were also two seek longevity locks*, a pair of silver bracelet, a set of the four stationary treasure\u2013 presumably that they heard Lian Che will go to school next year and specially prepared it.Image result for \u00e5\u00a6\u201a\u00e6\u201e\u00e9\u2022\u00bf\u00e5\u2018\u00bd\u00e9\u201dThis lock charm is still kept in modern times.They\u2019re so dainty and cute.So, I had to display a modern version.When Third Aunt heard that it was to be made into clothes, she stared at Lian Fang Zhou with eager eyes.Lian Fang Zhou just smiled, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to make them quickly. Should be able to make a set for each person.\u201d\u201cDefinitely enough! There\u2019s a lot of material!\u201d Third Aunt became overjoyed and said, \u201cJust that it\u2019s too bland. Next time we\u2019re at the town, we\u2019ll get some bolt of bright fine cloth to make outerwear. Perfect for this month to wear!\u201dLian Fang Zhou\u2019s eyes dimmed, lightly sighed, \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. Third Aunt did you forget? Us siblings are in mourning.\u201dOnce the words were out, Third Aunt uttered out \u2018Eh\u2019 feeling a bit ashamed. Lian Ze and the others also bared out grieved expressions.\u201cDidn\u2019t think it\u2019s only half a year since Father and Mother was gone. It felt like it was a long, long time ago!\u201dLian Ze lamentedLian Fang Zhou gently spoke, \u201cNo matter where Father and Mother is, they are thinking of us and hoping we are well. That\u2019s why we need to be well to let them be at ease!\u201d\u201cSister, I will definitely study hard. Be better than cousin! In the future, nobody is allowed to bully Sister and also little sister!\u201d Lian Che stated.\u201cSister, I\u2019ll be obedient too! I can help with lots of things! Won\u2019t let Sister worry!\u201d Lian Fang Qing also voiced out.Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s heart warmed and smiled. \u201cEn, Sister knows you are good kids! Our whole family\u2019s day will get better and better! Come, look at the pastries Cousin Fang Qing gifted. Let\u2019s try them!\u201dLian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t want to continue that oppressive topic and genially distracted.Rural area kids rarely get any kind of snack at the year-end, lt alone pastries which only wealthy can buy. Lian Fang Qing\u2019s eyes lit up and clapped her hands as she agreed in delight. Even Lian Che couldn\u2019t help widened his eyes.Image result for nine compartment food boxTwo square boxes with grid compartments. One was colorful with different kinds of delicacies; water chestnut cake, white sugar sponge cake, sweet-scented osmanthus cake, mung bean slice, milk curd, etc. The other one had different kinds of preserved fruits and candies; dried apricots, peach preserve, candied dates, raisins, pine nut sweet, etc. Each was exquisitely made.\u201cIt\u2019s really pretty! It must be yummy!\u201dLian Fang Qing\u2019s eyes curved in delight.Third Aunt couldn\u2019t resist smacking her lips, exclaimed, \u201cOur mouths are in luck! \u201dLian Fang Zhou, Lian Ze and the others don\u2019t like eating snacks much. Lian Fang Qing really love them, same with Third Aunt. When the two of them have nothing to do, they will fry some old pumpkin seed or chestnuts to snack on for half a day.As for Lian Fang Zhou, Lian Ze and others, they sometimes ate a few pieces. The rest was left for Lian Fang Qing, and Third Aunt to slowly consume. Lian Fang Zhou called Ah Jian over to have a taste.Ah Jian politely refused, \u201cI don\u2019t really like sweet stuff! Leave it for Qing-er and Che-er!\u201dLian Fang Zhou just smiled and let it be. But she mentally considered, \u2018Ordinary people can\u2019t afford to eat sweet food since sugar is costly. There\u2019s not many who don\u2019t like it. Ah Jian never lies. From the looks of it, his identity isn\u2019t low \u2026\u2019\u201cAh\u201d Lian Fang Zhou was deep in thoughts when Third Aunt suddenly touched her lightly and pulled her to one side. She quietly inquired, \u201cHow did it go? Did you see your cousin? Were you able to borrow money?\u201dIt goes without saying that Lian Fang Zhou won\u2019t tell Third Aunt she was able to borrow ten thousand liang. Third Aunt would have never imagined it\u2019ll be such a large amount of money.Wealth can make people go crazy. Not even mentioning the problem of would Third Aunt having thoughts on it, what if she accidently let it slip? It\u2019ll definitely cause a lot of trouble. Uncle and Aunt will be the first to harass them like devil-may-care.\u201cEn, I borrowed enough,\u201d Lian Fang Zhou responded. \u201cTonight we need to have a discussion. Third Aunt this time you won\u2019t stop me, right? \u201d\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Third Aunt originally wanted to ask how much was she did borrow. But Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s answer just now was clearly not wanting to tell her the amount, so she tactfully didn\u2019t ask. Just uttered, \u201cYou won\u2019t let it go? Going to plant that whatever cotton for real? In my opinion, better to buy some fertile land!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t dissuade me anymore. I still want to give it a go!\u201dLian Fang Zhou shook her head, responded, \u201cI feel like we can give growing cotton a try. The money borrowed still need to be returned!\u201d\u201cAh? Need to be returned?\u201d Third Aunt cried out in disappointment. \u201cThat Su Family, aren\u2019t they really rich? In the past, your mother and your cousin\u2019s mother had such a close relationship. After your cousin\u2019s mother passed away, your mother had helped your cousin! Now she\u2019s reluctant to help you guys\u2026\u201dLian Fang Zhou then stated, \u201cCousin is a really nice person, but borrowing is borrowing. Since it\u2019s borrowing then naturally I will return the money. I\u2019m not willing to owe her too much! In this age, you\u2019re fortunate if someone is willing to lend money!\u201d\u201cHearing you say like that, it\u2019s true!\u201d Third Aunt became merry, and her mind was put to ease. Maybe Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t have that meaning, but she could hear that if it couldn\u2019t be returned, Su Family probably won\u2019t force them to return.After dinner, Lian Fang Zhou selected a few pastries, packed them up and sent it over to Aunt Zhang\u2019s family for them to try. And why she\u2019s at it, she discussed the charcoal matter.During this period, she needed to buy land, and then buy people, hire people, buy fertilizer, and prepare the ground way, so the seed can be smoothly sowed. That\u2019s why they can\u2019t participate in the charcoal process.As a girl, it wasn\u2019t convenient for her to run around and handle matters outside. Ah Jian is the most suitable and unsuitable to accompany her.Suitable because Ah Jian was adult and from a glance, he gives a steady and trustworthy vibe. There\u2019s also his highly skilled martial arts, so if they run into some trouble, he can suppress it. At least, won\u2019t let Lian Fang Zhou suffer.Unsuitable because he\u2019s neither relatives or friend, and as a single man and a lone female, it\u2019ll be inconvenient. Gossip is a fearful thing.So, will need Lian Ze to accompany them.Traveling with three people was the optimal way.Lian Fang Zhou gave a lengthy explanation. Aunt Zhang and Uncle also expressed that\u2019s the way it should be.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Since the wood supply is enough for 2-3 rounds, there\u2019s only the trivial matter of overnight watch and sealing the kiln left. Your aunt, your brother San He, your Sao-zi and I can do it! You can carry on doing your stuff! Later we\u2019ll still split our sales equally!\u201dLian Fang Zhou rushed to speak, \u201cThis can\u2019t do! I\u2013\u201d\u201cFrom what I see, it\u2019s reasonable. I also have the same thought!\u201d Aunt Zhang cut her words. She spoke with no room for argument, \u201cThe charcoal method is your and Ah Jian. How would we know what to do? We wouldn\u2019t have been able to earn this money! Don\u2019t mention you taking half, even taking more than half is right! Not only this year but also every year from now on. As long as we have, you also have a share! Don\u2019t refuse! Otherwise, what kind of people will we become!\u201dUncle Li also nodded at the side.Seeing that they spoke like this, Lian Fang Zhou have nothing else to say and inclined her head with a smile, said, \u201cThen many thanks, Uncle, Aunt, Brother, and Sao-zi! For now, we\u2019ll leave it like this for this year. As for the future, we\u2019ll talk again then!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the way it should be!\u201d Uncle Li and Aunt Zhang beamed.\u201cFang Zhou ah, you really want to plant that cotton? This, I heard you borrowed from whichever cousin in Shuang Liu County. In case it fails, what will you do?\u201d Aunt Zhang couldn\u2019t help ask.Lian Fang Zhou knew she had good intention, patiently replied, \u201cYou can rest at ease, I feel it\u2019ll be like before when the government spread sweet potato. It shouldn\u2019t go wrong!\u201d\u201cHow could it be the same? Before the government spread sweet potato, our town already sold them. That time, it was quite rare good! Despite knowing this, those who try growing them were little at the start. The main reason was that they didn\u2019t know how to handle them. This potato and something cotton\u2026 from the sound of it, it\u2019s not reliable!\u201d Aunt Zhang knitted her brows.Lian Fang Zhou lightly sighed out, explained. \u201cAunt Zhang, you also know my family situation! Ah Ze and the others are still young. In the future, they need to marry a wife and need dowry. I also want to provide for Che-er\u2019s study! Inside and out, many places use the money! Just relying on the little produce from the field, even exhausting ourselves to death, we won\u2019t be able to do it! I can only go all out and give it a fight! If there wasn\u2019t this opportunity, then there\u2019s nothing to say. But since the opportunity is here, I\u2019m afraid of missing this one and won\u2019t get another chance!\u201dAunt Zhang\u2019s heart ached when hearing this, subconsciously nodded. She sighed, \u201d What you say got some reason! Oh, it\u2019s tough on you! Child, you got a lot to shoulder ah!\u201d\u201cThis is cause there\u2019s no other way!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled, she initially wanted to persuade Aunt Zhang and the others to plant cotton and potato as well, but after some pondering, she decided to drop it! Otherwise, wait until everyone witness it next year, and it\u2019ll be hard to explain her foreknowledge.Aunt Zhang and Uncle can only lament and remain silent.\u201cThen I\u2019ll leave first! I still need to head to Zhang Li Zheng\u2019s home and inquire about the seed matter!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou smiled.\u201cAlright, I won\u2019t make you stay then!\u201d Aunt Zhang responded.Uncle Li also spoke, \u201cYou go then. If you need our help, tell us!\u201d\u201cEn\u201d Lian Fang Zhou uttered in response and left.Naturally, she can\u2019t go empty-handed to Zhang Li Zheng\u2019s place. However, there was nothing presentable, so she packed another big sack of charcoal pieces over again.She can tell that Mrs. Niu was especially pleased with those charcoal pieces. And what\u2019s more, her words were all laced with the meaning the more, the better.Anyhow, it doesn\u2019t cost anything, might as well send some again.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Zhang Li Zheng suspected there were problems with his ears. Suprised her questioned, \u201cYou, you are willing to buy all the cotton seed? Do you know how many there are? Over a thousand jin!\u201dAt this, Lian Fang Zhou was secretly delighted, \u2018afraid over a thousand isn\u2019t enough!\u2019She nodded, responded, \u201cAs long as they have no objection, I want it. This matter, I need to ask you to help tell everyone! People won\u2019t believe my words, ah!\u201dLian Fang Zhou giving flattery made Zhang Li Zheng\u2019s heart more comfortable, but Zhang Li Zheng was a clever man. He didn\u2019t immediately promise Lian Fang Zhou, instead asked the reason.She\u2019s willing to plant that many cotton for no reason at all, who would believe it?Then Lian Fang Zhou repeated the exact same explanation she gave Aunt Zhang.Zhang Li Zheng couldn\u2019t help feel some empathy.While Mrs. Niu deeply sobbed, glares at Zhang Li Zheng as she spoke, \u201cFang Zhou, this child, doesn\u2019t have it easy! Since she already said it like this, then we\u2019ll help her! Isn\u2019t it just a matter of passing on words. Whether they are willing or not, everyone decides for themselves! Only, \u201dMrs. Niu paused, then said, \u201cFang Zhou ah, with this many seeds, how much land will be needed to plant them ah. You will buy land, right?The meaning was, where did you get the money?Zhang Li Zheng\u2019s gaze also flashed, stared at Lian Fang Zhou for her answer.By land, buy seeds, hire people, it\u2019s a large sum of money ah!Lian Fang Zhou replied, \u201cI borrowed from a relative. It\u2019s my cousin, who married over to Shuang Liu County. My mother and her mother were extremely close in the past. A few days ago, I made a trip to go borrow money.\u201d\u201cOh, \u201d Mrs. Niu uttered and did not continue to ask.Zhang Li Zheng considered a moment, then half-seriously and half-jokingly questioned, \u201cWhy do you just want cotton seeds, and not want it with the potato seed as well?Lian Fang Zhou smiled, \u201cDidn\u2019t they say cotton can turn into yarn to make clothes? I think this is more suitable to grow!\u201d\u201cHaha,\u201d Zhang Li Zheng laughed and nodded. \u201cYou put some thought into it!\u201dThis reason doesn\u2019t count as a reason, can own say it\u2019s their own assumptions. However, can\u2019t also say it\u2019s not a reason.\u201cAlright, \u201d Zhang Li Zheng dipped his head and declared. \u201cI\u2019ll notify everyone!\u201dLian Fang Zhou nodded, grinned, \u201cUncle Li Zheng, can you word it like this to everyone: If any family doesn\u2019t want to plant cotton, they must come to your place within three days and let you know. This counts as everyone giving it to me. I won\u2019t let them do it for nothing. For each jin, I\u2019ll pay two wens, and let them get it from you here. And in passing, provide a signature! Later on, I\u2019ll send the money over to you!\u201dZhang Li Zheng couldn\u2019t resist looking at Lian Fang Zhou a few more times, dipped his in acknowledgment, \u201cYou have it thoroughly thought out ah! This way is better, saves a lot of future problems!\u201dZhang Li Zheng agreed outright.Initially, he had some doubts. The proverb is right, the same rice raised one different person. Which village and which place doesn\u2019t have a few shameless rascals? Those on top were forcefully distributing the seeds and spread it to each and every household. If he were to sell all the seeds to Lian Fang Zhou, and by chance, there are those crafty fellows wait until Lian Fang Zhou buy the seeds and then come looking for a commotion to buy. At that time, where can he go find seeds for them?Zhang Li Zheng definitely won\u2019t do this kind of helping others and trouble comes looking matter.Since Lian Fang Zhou was willing to buy each jin for two wens, and also take signature, then there\u2019s nothing to be afraid!\u201cThen I\u2019ll bring over the money tomorrow!\u201d Delighted, Lian Fang Zhou quickly thanked him.\u201cOkay!\u201d Zhang Li Zheng said, \u201cWhen you bring over the money, I\u2019ll let everyone know at once!\u201dWithout demur, she thanked again said a few words and then took her leave.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Fell prey to a plot.After she left, Mrs. Niu couldn\u2019t resist blurting out, \u201cFrom what I see, this girl might have become foolish! If there were really such a great matter, ordinary people like us would never have a chance! Don\u2019t whom she was deceived by, but her guts aren\u2019t small! Isn\u2019t she afraid of suffering a loss? However, this way is good, haha, we\u2019ll sell our portion of forty-fifty jin to her. Not only do we solve a problem, but also earn a hundred wens!Zhang Li Zheng gaze was deep, after pondering, he spoke, \u201cWe\u2019ll sell half of our share of seeds. For the other half, en, leave it to try ourselves!\u201cAh? That can\u2019t do! Planting food is much better, why plant those unreliable things!\u201d Mrs. Niu immediately widened her eyes and disagreed.The couple had a round of argument. In final result of the discussion was keep two jin to experiment. After those cotton seedlings sprout out, Mrs. Niu found them more displeasing the more she saw it. And called her son to eradicate them all and change to soya bean. Zhang Li Zheng scolded her a bit and let it be.After coming out of Zhang Li Zheng\u2019s home, Lian Fang Zhou was in a cheerful and excited mood. Her steps were more light-hearted. The evening wind carried a cold chill, but she didn\u2019t feel it.Just the thought of the matter is in progress, she can\u2019t control her happiness.\u2018The seeds mater is mostly settled. Next, need to look at the field, and then afterward, can check how much seeds is short\u2026 For the ground, got to hire a few people to give it a simple sorting out. Wait until after year-end when spring come, buy a few honest and hardworking ones.\u2019\u2018Also, the spinning wheeling to spin the cotton, don\u2019t know if there is a big difference between the modern one. And the tool for cottonseed removal needs to be made as well.\u2019She had seen these things before in her previous life, but undoubtedly, she doesn\u2019t know how to make them. Have to inquire a professional craftsman, they should be able to make it according to her description!Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t help be thankful, due to her frequent visits to the countryside for data collection and research work in her previous life. And her interest toward the nearly extinct tools and skills. When she chanced upon them, she would always take a closer look and ask for an outline. Never thought it would come in handy now!Imagining the vast profit gained from next year hefty harvest of cotton, Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s delight on her face deepened.\u201cFang Zhou ah, it\u2019s you right!\u201d Out of nowhere, a middle-aged woman\u2019s voice rang out, startling Lian Fang Zhou and affected her happy mood a lot.Because the middle-aged woman that stopped her was Mrs. Qiao.\u201cAunt ah, is there something the matter?\u201d Lian Fang Zhou indifferently asked.She had some suspicion, \u201cDid she know I went to borrow money? Have ideas on it? Hmm, even Mrs. Niu had a faint idea, let alone Mrs. Qiao? Third Aunt, that blabbermouth! It was no use to repeatedly warned her!\u201cHehe, there is a small matter!\u201d Mrs. Qiao grinned and said. \u201cIt really cold here, let\u2019s go over to Aunt\u2019s place! Your Uncle and I have some things to say!\u201d\u201cAunt got something to say then say it here! It\u2019s late, I need to head back!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou stated.\u201cOh, why act so distant with Aunt? It\u2019s just a few steps away, why can\u2019t you go to Aunt\u2019s home? Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s only a few words. Once said you can leave, it won\u2019t delay you a lot! What? Afraid hat Aunt would eat you?\u201d Mrs. Qiao smiled.Lian Fang Zhou observed her. She felt Mrs. Qiao\u2019s attitude today was so nice that it was a bit odd!She can\u2019t decline, and could only be pulled over there by Mrs. Qiao. Anyway, she had already made up her mind, \u2018If she wants to trick her and want money, no way!\u2019\u201cFang Zhou ah, mind your feet! It\u2019s dark here, don\u2019t trip over\u2026\u2026\u201dEntering the courtyard, Mrs. Qiao nagged behind her back.Lian Fang Zhou subconsciously looked down to watch the ground. Suddenly the back of her head was hit by something heavy, and her body swayed. She could only have time to glare at Mrs. Qiao fiercely before she flopped down and enter into the endless darkness.\u201cDead girl, who told you to act so sharp-tongue! Act so mighty! Have a taste of this lady\u2019s might, hmph!\u201d Mrs. Qiao casually threw away her wooden stick, clapped her hands, and sneered.At this time, two people slowly came from behind a pile of firewood at the side. From silhouette, it was a young married woman and an accompanying maid.\u201cIs this appropriate? There won\u2019t be trouble, right?\u201d The young woman quietly spoke.\u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d Mrs. Qiao hearty laughed and said with complete confidence, \u201cI\u2019m her direct Aunt, I can decide! Hmph, also, it\u2019s allowing her to live in ease and comfort. Isn\u2019t it wonderful to be decked in gold and silver? It\u2019s better than digging the soil for food! Wait until she understands that, she\u2019ll thank me!\u201dFinished speaking, the to exchange gaze and quietly burst into waves of laughter.Wait until she understands. Might as well say what\u2019s done is done and raw rice is already cooked!This young woman was the county town\u2019s Wang Ji satin and silk shop manager\u2019s concubine, called Hua Jin Tao.This Hua Jin Tao and the recently married to Yang Huai Shan, Hua Xiao Hua are cousins from father side. She came back yesterday to join in on Hua Xiao Hua\u2019s wedding feast.Mrs. Qiao saw that Hua Jin Tao was wearing gold and silver, and wore make-up, looking neat and beautiful. Those shiny gold bracelets on her wrist were at least a width of a finger, appears to be very thick and solid. Also, she got a maid serving her. It\u2019s a difference between sky and ground to when she previously stayed at home. She couldn\u2019t resist envying.A thought came to her, hypocrisy and audacity were birthed. She implemented several ideas to get closer to Hua Jin Tao. Her words filled with innuendo, the meaning was asking Hua Jin Tao, if she knew anyone in town looking for a concubine? She wanted to introduce one to Lian Fang Zhou.Hua Jin Tao\u2019s mind moved. Her home received an important business guest. Two evenings ago during a drink, he mentioned to her family master that going to the store too much, now there\u2019s nothing fresh. He wanted to have a taste of an authentic countryside girl and half-jokingly asked master if he knows any connection?Lian Fang Zhou? That girl got pretty good features; delicate brows, beautiful face structure and also pretty white skin. More importantly, she\u2019s authentic!What\u2019s more, she\u2019s parentless, got her engagement dissolved by her cousin\u2019s husband family and lost her reputation. This matter was also decided by her direct Aunt. An excellent choice to mold. And even if by some tiny chance it was exposed, the blame won\u2019t fall onto her head!Let alone, there\u2019s no one willing to help her seek justice!It\u2019s like a godsend pillow when you\u2019re about to doze! Hua Jin Tao was overjoyed on the inside for a while.However, she lived in the town for over a year now. She also learned about reading a person\u2019s thought from their face. Her mind was most definitely willing, but her expression doesn\u2019t show a hint of it. She just used some ambiguous words to bait Mrs. Qiao\u2019s appetite, making Mrs. Qiao enduring the itching in her heart.In the end, it goes without saying the two came into agreement. And the Hua Jin Tao seized the hold, dropping the price very low to only five silver liang!Hua Jin Tao was feeling thrilled on the inside. With just five liang, she bought a giant favor. Master will definitely dote her! That yellowed-face woman can go sleep in the storeroom!As to whether Lian Fang Zhou is willing or not, both her and Mrs. Qiao doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter!Woman ma, no matter how strong personality they have, as long as their body been taken advantage by a man, they can only resign to one fate! Under the sky, how could there be so many chaste, fiery girl?Pitiful Fang Zhou little sis, your firmly believed bitterness is finished, sweetness will begin ah\u2013Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The searchWhen the time comes, gift her to the important guest, and he would take her away from Yunhe County. As to whether she becomes ox or horse, acting as a servant and slave, it got nothing to do with them.\u201cThe person is here, the money? Pay me, then the person is yours!\u201d Mrs. Qiao grinningly demanded.Actually, even without money, she is willing to do it just for the sake of venting out. It goes without saying, receiving cash is even better!Hua Jin Tao took a cluster of silver nuggets from the purse she always carried and handed to her. \u201cThere\u2019s only more, never less! In the future, you can\u2019t renege!\u201d\u201cRest assured! We\u2019re from the same village, familiar head familiar face, so how could I!\u201dMrs. Qiao affirmed.\u201cThat is that this is this, it\u2019s better to state it clearly! I\u2019m feeling uneasy. Unless you swear upon your family\u2019s Lian Hai\u2019s life, I won\u2019t believe you!\u201dBecause the two of them don\u2019t know how to write, and this matter was short notice, and they can\u2019t find a suitable person to write the indenture. That\u2019s why it can only be a verbal agreement.\u201cTo say this!\u201d Mrs. Qiao heard Hua Jin Tao state this, her heart jumped for no reason, and wasn\u2019t very pleased. She had repeatedly promised Hua Jin Tao but didn\u2019t believe her, and what\u2019s more, Lian Li who went out visiting might nearly be back. She had hidden this matter from him, and if he bumps into this, there\u2019ll be a lot of trouble. Chances are he wouldn\u2019t agree!Mrs. Qiao had no other way but to swear under Hua Jin Tao\u2019s watch, while her mind cursed Hua Jing Tao.\u201cThen it\u2019s all good!\u201d Hua Jin Tao heart finally settled down. She merrily said, \u201cI\u2019ll leave now!\u201dWith that, she ordered her maid, Xiao Yao-er to go fetch the driver who had hidden at one side to come in and help carry the person into the carriage.For this matter, she found an excuse, told her family she got urgent matter and needed to return to the town that night.Watching the carriage distancing from her own front entrance further and further away as she gripped the silver in her hands, Mrs. Qiao\u2019s lips curled up into a sneer. Through clenched teeth, she quietly remarked, \u201cDead girl, you\u2019re gonna get it good! Aren\u2019t you mighty? Try act mighty for me to see now!\u201d\u201cWhat are you mumbling about?\u201dOut of nowhere, a voice appeared, causing Mrs. Qiao to jump in surprise. She patted her chest as she hastily looked up and saw Lian Li standing there, looking at her strangely. She snapped, \u201cDead old man, you nearly scared me to death in the dark.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing in the yard in the dark?\u201dLian Li oddly looked.\u201cNot, nothing!\u201d Mrs. Qiao looked up toward the sky, evasively replied. \u201cJust, just checking if tomorrow would be a clear day. Well, the sky is pitch black, humid and gloomy, afraid it\u2019ll be an overcast day!\u201dMrs. Qiao said as she turned to go into the house. She subconsciously gripped the nuggets tightly in her hand and silently hid it in her pocket.At Lian Family Second branch, Lian Fang Qing already ran over to the entrance, swept a look outside a good few times, her mouth mumbled, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t Sister back yet? What\u2019s taking her so long?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right! It\u2019s dark, so it couldn\u2019t be that she fell on the road?\u201d Third Aunt glanced outside and also commented.\u201cI\u2019ll go look around!\u201d Lian Ze couldn\u2019t stay sitting anymore and stood up. Don\u2019t know why, but he felt unsettled, and his heartbeat was also chaotic.\u201cI\u2019ll come with you!\u201d Ah Jian spoke.\u201cYou guys, be careful!\u201d Third Aunt grabbed a lit up stick which was wrapped with rosin, passed it to them to use the fire for illumination.Lian Ze reached out to receive it.Unexpectedly, when the two of them went to Zhang Li Zheng\u2019s home to ask, Zhang Li Zheng and Mrs. Niu were surprised and swiftly responded. \u201cFang Zhou? She already left for a long while now! It couldn\u2019t be that she dropped into someone else house?\u201dLian Ze\u2019s face whitened, pushed to smile as he gave his thanks and left Zhang Li Zheng\u2019s home.\u201cSo late in the night, my Sister wouldn\u2019t go visiting! My Sister never liked dropping by others home. What\u2019s more, besides Aunt Zhang\u2019s, she won\u2019t rashly go to another\u2019s home!\u201d Lian Ze\u2019s tone filled with certainty. His mood became even more agitated and disorderly.Ah Jian lightly patted his shoulder, warmly spoke, \u201cDon\u2019t become anxious yet! We\u2019ll go to Aunt Zhang\u2019s home and have a look! Maybe your sister went there again!\u201dLian Ze had no other ideas, so could only incline his head.Once the two of them arrive at Aunt Zhang\u2019s home, they still didn\u2019t find Lian Fang Zhou. Lian Ze\u2019s expression became even more terrible. He anxiously cried out, \u201cSo late in the night, where would my sister go? Could it be something happened!?\u201d\u201cAiya! Ah Ze, guard your tongue! Our village is always very peaceful, what things could possibly happen!\u201d Aunt Zhang quickly interjected.Ah Jian couldn\u2019t help frown as well, mentioned, \u201cFang Zhou is someone who let us know where she goes, maybe\u2026 she did bump into an accident or something. Aunt Zhang, must trouble you to help. Let\u2019s split up and look around each home. No matter if we found her or not, we\u2019ll meet up in thirty minutes.\u201dNaturally, Aunt Zhang and the others were willing, nodded, and said, \u201cOkay! Let Ah Juan stay at home, we\u2019ll go look!\u201dWith no time lost, everyone split up to look.Less than half an hour, Li San He stopped Lian Ze and Ah Jian at an entrance of someone house. He quickly notified, \u201cYao Family\u2019s aunt at village west said she saw your Aunt pulling Fang Zhou to her home! You guys check\u2013\u201d\u201cHer!\u201d Lian Ze became angry. \u201cTo actually forget her house! For her to look for my sister, it\u2019s definitely nothing good!\u201dHe thanked Li San He, and with Ah Jian, he hastily rushed over there.Li San Ge chased behind them for a few steps and loudly yelled, \u201cTalk peacefully, don\u2019t be anxious! If you need any help, come to our home and ask!\u201dLian Fang Zhou family\u2019s matter with her Uncle and Aunt family isn\u2019t something convenient for the outsider to stick into. So, Li San He couple and their parents didn\u2019t follow.Lian Ze twisted his head around and answered, then busily head over.It was already late in the night, Lian Li and Mrs. Qiao boiled water and prepared to wash up and sleep.When they heard yard door was thunderously knocked, both were startled.Mrs. Qiao felt guilty, so was scared til nearly half of her soul left. But thinking back on how tonight\u2019s matter was done in complete secrecy, so even if those kiddies of the second branch ask, as long as she firmly denies, they can\u2019t do anything to her.And what\u2019s more, Lian Fang Zhou that lass isn\u2019t here, meaning those kiddies lost their backbone. How can they create havoc?\u201cWho\u2019s there!\u201d Extremely annoyed, Lian Li yelled on top of his lung.Lian Ze was deeply infuriated, didn\u2019t bother speaking, use his arms and legs simultaneously and started to kick the door.\u201cBastard, what do you want to do in the middle of the night!\u201d Lian Li rushed out in towering rage and noisily pulled opened the door bar. When he saw Lian Ze and Ah Jian, he froze and could not vent out. With an icy expression, he bellowed, \u201cLian Ze, I see you are becoming more and more disrespectful\u2014 Ai! What are you doing!?\u201dWithout waiting for his sentence to finish, Lian Ze pushed him aside and directly barged inside.Lian Li wanted to stop him but was held by Ah Jian and was pushed lightly to the side. While he was staggering, Ah Jian followed Lian Ze in giant strides.\u201cWhat are you doing! Late in the night, you barge into my home for what? What madness are you having!\u201d Exasperated, Lian Li rushed over as he burst into a holler.Lian Ze did not find Lian Fang Zhou, abruptly stopped, his gaze coldly swept to the two people. \u201cWhere\u2019s my sister? What did you do to my sister!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You\u2013\u201d\u201cSpeak! Where my sister!?\u201d Lian Ze sternly bellowed, his expression became frosty. A cold, severe stare landed on Lian Li, that gaze dying to dismember him.Lian Li froze. His half-finished scolding literally came to a halt and felt foolish.\u201cYour sister? What does it have to do with us where your sister is! You saw for yourself, she\u2019s not at our home.\u201d Lian Li grumbled, his tone has calmed down. Initially, he wanted to say a few vicious words, but seeing Lian Ze was about to erupt into a rage, he judiciously decided not to say too much.\u201cYou still deny it!\u201d Filled with resentment Lian Ze glare at Mrs. Qiao. \u201cSomeone clearly saw you beckoned my sister to your home!\u201d\u201cMrs. Qiao\u2019s expression slightly changed, rushed to interject, \u201cWhat nonsense are you saying! Unless I went crazy, then I would beckon her to my home! And also, I never went out tonight! It\u2019s dark, so who knows who went blind and started a rumor! They deserve to be struck by lightning for accusing this old lady!\u201dLian Li heard this, looked at Mrs. Qiao with suspicion, and there was an inkling of doubt in his mind. He can tell Mrs. Qiao was slightly nervous. What\u2019s more, when he came back, Mrs. Qiao was standing in the yard.If nothing happened, why did she stand in the yard for no reason?Lian Li left thoughts as thoughts, he won\u2019t help Lian Ze questioned his own wife. Especially under the situation where Lian Ze was so turbulent.\u201cYou saw for yourself if your sister isn\u2019t at this hall, where can she be? If you don\u2019t believe me, you can call her!\u201d Lian Li sneered.Mrs. Qiao heard her husband sticking up for her, her heart slight settled. Her back became uptight and snorted.\u201cI don\u2019t believe you! I\u2019m going to search!\u201d Lian Ze\u2019s gaze was anxious as well as chaotic.\u201cHa! What a funny joke!\u201d Lian Li was mad, pointed at him, and said, \u201cWho do you think you are? It\u2019s enough that you don\u2019t think of us as your elder, but you shouldn\u2019t also think of stamping us! Lian Ze, aren\u2019t you afraid of retribution?\u201d\u201cI will definitely search!\u201d Lian Ze\u2019mind was focused on Lian Fang Zhou, so how could he bother with so much? As he spoke, he intended to dash in.\u201cStop right there!\u201d\u201cRebelling! Rebelling! Actually rebelling!\u201dIt goes without saying, Lian Li and Mrs. Qiao won\u2019t agree, they stepped forward to push and block.Mrs. Qiao yelled, \u201cYou can\u2019t search our house, just because you want to. You must give us an explanation if you can\u2019t find anything!\u201d\u201cKill or cut, do whatever you like!\u201d Lian Ze didn\u2019t even wrinkle his brow. He firmly believed Lian Fang Zhou was definitely hidden by them.\u201cPeh!\u201d Mrs. Qiap spat at the ground, uttered, \u201cWho would kill or cut. I don\u2019t desire your life! If you can\u2019t search her out, you must apologize and do three dogeza to us in front of everyone. Also, compensate us a hundred silver liang!\u201dIf there\u2019s no cash at hand, we can also agree on selling the land and work to pay back.Without any pondering, Lian Ze was going to agree, but Ah Jian found there was something fishy about the matter and lightly pulled him, said, \u201cStop!\u201d\u201cWhat does this matter have to do with you!? What do you think you are! You, an outsider have no right to intervene in Lian Family\u2019s matter!\u201d Mrs. Qiao discourteously pointed at Ah Jian and scolded.Ah Jian\u2019s face was calm with no hint of anger, the glow in his eyes was restrained and so deep that one doesn\u2019t know where the bottom is. Mrs. Qiao glanced at him and became timid. She unconsciously dodged to the side. Remembering this was her home, she forcefully straightened her own back. A stance of not letting it drop.Ah Jian steadily took a step toward her,Instantly, Mrs. Qiao felt a mighty torrent of pressure pressing down on her, making her feel slightly suffocated. She subconsciously retreated backward and stammered, \u201cWhat, what are you doing! You, you, don\u2019t come over!\u201dAh Jian didn\u2019t bother responding her. In a few steps, he calmly stood an arm-width in front of her, asked, \u201cWhere is Fang Zhou?\u201d\u201cHow would I know! She\u2019s not my family, why bother with her!\u201d Mrs. Qiao screeched back.With a wave of a hand, Lian Li stood upright in front of Mrs. Qiao, glared at Ah Jian, \u201cWhat are you doing? Do you have a right to speak here? You\u2013\u201dAh Jian raised his hand, pushed Lian Li to the side. Lian Li clearly saw his action was very light, but he stumbled back five-six steps before he could regain his stability.\u201cYOU\u201d He yelled out in fury as he bolted to fight it out with him. Ah Jian swiftly looked over, icy cold eyes gazed at Lian Li, making his heart tremble and legs stood to the ground like a nail.At this moment, he dared not go forward; instead, he wanted to run far far away!What he doesn\u2019t was that aura was called killing intent and it was one reeked with blood.Ah Jian turned his head back, still kept on staring at Mrs. Qiao. He lightly spoke, \u201cI\u2019ll ask you once more, where is Fang Zhou?\u201dMrs. Qiao\u2019s panic at the beginning and the forced calmness afterward did not escape Ah Jian\u2019s eyes. And later on, when Lian Ze insisted on searching the house, her certainty let Ah Jian clearly deduce she knew where Lian Fang Zhou is, and it was definitely not in this yard or inside this house.\u201cI, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Mrs. Qiao was agitated and mad, so she freaked out and yelled in response.Ah Jian fiercely grabbed her arm, Mrs. Qiao shrieked out, \u201cWhat are you doing! What are you doing! Somebody! Save me!\u201d\u201cShout, keep on shouting. Best that you called all the villager to come to see the liveliness!\u201d Ah Jian did not withdraw a single bit. Instead, it was just like he said, and the strength in his hand secretly increased.Mrs. Qiao groaned out in pain. Gritting her teeth, she struggled as she cried out \u2018Let me go!\u2019. She had lost her former tone.Fine, even if she wasn\u2019t young anymore, she was still a woman! If someone saw her arm being gripped like this by Ah Jian, her name will be affected. And the one who gets laughed at and talked about would be her.It was obvious that Ah Jian didn\u2019t care. However, she does and Lian Li as well.\u201cStill not talking!\u201d Lian Li bellowed and suddenly forcefully pulled.\u201cAh!\u201d Mrs. Qiao shrieked in pain. With great momentum, her body turned and flung away. A clear clang rang out. A snow-white, shiny silver fell out of her pocket and cold light shimmered from it.Staring at that silver, Lian Li quietly gasped and his expression was vicious when he glared at Mrs. Qiao.\u201cIt\u2019s, it\u2019s my own!\u201d Startled, Mrs. Qiao was panic-stricken.\u201cIs that so?\u201d Ah Jian raised a brow, icily spoke, \u201cYou\u2019re not telling the truth! This piece of silver is around few liang, nobody would carry this much on them for no reason! If you still don\u2019t say, then don\u2019t blame me for being impolite!\u201dMrs. Qiao betted on the fact that Ah Jian and Lian Ze had no evidence, so what can they do anything to her. Even though she was terrified and panicked on the inside, she just had to persist on denying, they can\u2019t do anything to her!She was confident that they dare not take her life!Lian Ze saw those few pieces of silver and heard Ah Jian spoke like this, he bolted over, seized Mrs. Qiao as he shouted, \u201cWhat did you do to my sister! What did you do to my sister! \u201d\u201cI have no time to be wordy with you. You won\u2019t talk, I have my ways to make you talk!\u201d Ah Jian saw how she can persist on denying, he was also anxious. Seeing those nuggets, he immediately had a bad premonition.Mrs. Qiao twisted her head to the side, sneered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A \u2018crack\u2019 rang out, Mrs. Qiao\u2019s left arm loosely hung down, and in pain, she screamed out.\u201cSpeak or not!\u201d Ah Jian coldly bellowedSeeing Mrs. Qiao only moan out in pain, he turned his head to Lian Ze, spoke, \u201cStuff her mouth!\u201dUnhesitantly, Lian Ze grabbed a nearby cloth from the table, scrunched into a ball, and stuffed it into Mrs. Qiao mouth.Ah Jian placed more strength, Mrs. Qiao\u2019s other arm snapped with a crack. He vigorously pushed her, making her fall to the ground. He icily uttered, \u201cIf you want to speak, then nod. If not, I\u2019ll twist apart your leg joint. And, persist in not saying, break off your fingers one at a time! Don\u2019t believe, then give it a try!\u201dLian Li saw the situation, his body stood there shivering. Both of his legs weakened and dropped onto the ground paralyzed. He wanted to tell Mrs. Qiao to say it quickly, but his teeth clattered when he opened his mouth. Not a whole word was utter out.It hurt so much that Mrs. Qiao\u2019s eyes teared up. She was wrong! Really wrong!It hurt so much that it felt like she was dying. She had never thought it was possible for one to be in such pain.Only till this moment, did she understand how incorrect her thoughts were! She believed the guy in front of her definitely have ways to force an answer out of her.If he were being reasonable, he wouldn\u2019t do anything to her; but once he acts unreasonable, what else can she do other than honestly confess!Because she doesn\u2019t want to keep being in pain, and even more don\u2019t want to become disabled.Mrs. Qiao tried to look up at Ah Jian, continuously nodded with a teary face.These were not tears of repent; instead, it\u2019s of pain!Lian Ze swiftly bent down, pulled the cloth out of her mouth, anxious commanded, \u201cSpeak at once!\u201dAh Jian stood there unmoving like a towering mountain, looked down at her from high up.Mrs. Qiao retched out in disgust for a moment before taking deep breaths. With a face full of sweat and tears, she begged, \u201cIt hurts! Can you stop the pain for me first! Stop the pain!\u201dAh Jian remained there motionless, his expression was still cold and aloof.Don\u2019t ask why, but he knew to deal with some people, one had to torture her to get the truth. And once she gets a chance to relax, bad water will appear in her stomach again (come up with evil thoughts).Mrs. Qiao despaired. She finally understood that before she speaks the truth, Ah Jian will not stop the pain for her. At that moment, she dared not to demand conditions anymore, endured the pain and jerkily explained all she and Hua Jin Tao done clearly.Before she finished, Lian Ze was so mad that veins popped on his forehead, his fists clenched so tightly that his joint whitened and reddened eyes glared at her with the intent of ripping her apart.\u201cHow could you! How could you\u2026\u201d Lian Ze was infuriated to an unexplainable summit, and his mind was filled with resentment and desolate. But he did not know how to curse her.\u201cWhat did you say!\u201d Lian Li was also shocked, looked at Mrs. Qiao in disbelief. His voice trembled, \u201cYou, you woman, you, what good thing you have done! You got big guts!\u201dHe had never thought Mrs. Qiao would be so bold. Even though he also dislike Lian Fang Zhou and the few kids and curse them private in couple discussion and said similar words but he never thought of doing it for real.Ah Jian lightly patted Lian Ze\u2019s shoulder to remind him to calm down. He coldly watched Mrs. Qiao, \u201cIs what you tell the truth? Not a word of lies?\u201d\u201cNone! None! It\u2019s the truth! Really!\u201d Mrs. Qiao\u2019s conscious was fuzzy from the pain, and her sight became messy. She only felt her mind was fainting and blackening under the burst of pain assaulting her.This feeling was like being in hell, so how could she possibly dare hide anything.Ah Jian sneered, \u201cAlright, then swear in the same way! You understand my meaning!\u201dThe meaning was to do the same as she did with Hua Jin Tao, make an oath with her son\u2019s life.At once, Mrs. Qiao swore, and despite the pain, she urgently looked at Ah Jian.Ah Jian disdained her in his heart. He snorted, squatted down and \u2018Crack! Crack!\u2019 Her dislocated arms were returned to normal. He had the intention to teach her a lesson, so when helping her fix them, he purposely made her suffer.\u201cIf something happened to my Sister, Surname Qiao, pay with your life!\u201d Lian Ze glared at her with entirely red eyes, turned around to dash out.Ah Jian icily glanced at them and also turned to leave.Both of Mrs. Qiao\u2019s arm still ached, couldn\u2019t use much strength. Seeing that the person already left, her courage returned. After exhausting some effort to sit up on the ground, she squawked, \u201cA beast that has no respect for elders, did you see what he said! That dog deserves to be struck by lightning!\u201d\u201cYou b****!\u201d Lian Li suddenly rushed over, raised his hand, and \u2018Pa! Pa!\u2019 Left and right, he fiercely slammed her two slap, viciously voiced, \u201cYou actually dare do this without my knowledge! You, you want to cause the death of me!\u201dMrs. Qiao covered her inflamed aching cheeks, tearfully clarified, \u201cDidn\u2019t you also say by selling that dead girl, you can vent out anger! I successfully did it, why are you now blaming me instead?\u201dLian Li threw back, \u201cYou call this successful? If it was successful, how could that brat bring that wild man to trespass into our home? If you did it well, how could you end up like this?\u201dMrs. Qiao heard that her own man wasn\u2019t blaming her for doing this matter, but rather blaming her for not doing it cleanly and cause trouble. Her heart slightly relaxed, she quickly spoke, \u201cHow is it not a success? Hua Jin Tao must have reach town by now! Hmph, when they go knocking, the rice already become cooked! What can they do then? Other than accepting it? This matter isn\u2019t something glorious, so would they widely spread it around? When it gets out, they\u2019ll lose face!\u201dShe venomous bit out, \u201cJust risking one-time suffering to get rid of the detestable lass, this lady find it worth it!\u201dMrs. Qiao spiteful scold as she crawled up from the ground, stumbled to sit on a nearby chair.Lian Li glowered at her. His brows pinched as his mind fixed on something else, who knows what he was thinking.Ah Jian caught up with Lian Ze, grasped his arm, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s return first.\u201d\u201cBut\u2013\u201d\u201cListen to me, let\u2019s return first.\u201d Ah Jian\u2019s tone was firmer. He confidently declared, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, even if they want to \u2013, the soonest should be tomorrow. We still have time. Be calmer, nothing will happen to your sister!\u201dThe road wasn\u2019t easy to travel during the night. When Hua Jin Tao reached home, it was nearly in the middle of the night. The distinguished guest must have already fallen asleep. It would be unreasonable to send someone over in the middle of the night!\u201cBrother Ah Jian!\u201d When Lian Ze blanked out, he suddenly kneeled down toward him. Kowtowing, he cried, \u201cSave my sister! Please save my sister!\u201dLian Ze started sobbing, his shoulders quivered like a leaf in the autumn wind. His suppressed cry was like a whimpering kitten.He had never come across this situation. He really didn\u2019t know what to do! At this moment, his mind was chaotic and frightened. That deep feeling of being at a loss and helpless made him go crazy!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Rescue (part 1)\u201cQuickly stand up!\u201d Ah Jian swiftly bent down, forcefully pulled him up. Softly spoke, \u201cRest assured, I will definitely rescue her! Calm down, okay? This issue isn\u2019t as big as the sky falling down!\u201dLian Ze blanked out, raised his to gaze at Ah Jian and his mind slowly settled down.\u201cReally?\u201d Brother Ah Jian said it\u2019s not as big as the sky falling down. But in his opinion it was.\u201cEn,\u201d Ah Jian nodded and declared. \u201cLet\u2019s go, we return first! Have a discussion! You got to believe your sister. She\u2019s not someone who easily let the people who schemed her do as they like.\u201d\u201cEn!\u201d The knot in Lian Ze heart loosened a lot, he lightly dipped his head.The two of them returned home, found Aunt Zhang was also there. Initially, they planned to head to Aunt Zhang\u2019s home and let them know not to worry them. Now it saved them a trip.\u201cYou\u2019re back! Oh, where\u2019s Fang Zhou?\u201d Aunt Zhang, Third Aunt, and the two little ones stood up. Not seeing Lian Fang Zhou, they all started wondering.Lian Ze\u2019s eyes reddened, lowered his head, his lips moved, but no sound came out. He was terrified that he would burst into tears when he makes a sound.Ah Jian swept a glance at everyone then spoke, \u201cBump into trouble. But rest assured, I\u2019ll save and bring her back\u2026\u2026\u201dAt word \u2018trouble\u2019 and \u2018save\u2019, Third Aunt and Aunt Zhang heart clenched. When Ah Jian finished, both their face whitened at once.Lian Che and Lian Fang Qing half understood and half didn\u2019t, but observing everyone expression, they knew something terrible happened. Both of their lips slanted, and couldn\u2019t help but to start whimpering.\u201cThat goddamn old b***h! Heartless b**tard! She actually committed this kind of wicked thing\u201d Third Aunt broke into cursing. As she comforted the two little ones, she declared in vex, \u201cI\u2019m going to settled this with her now!\u201d\u201cThird Aunt, you can\u2019t\u201d Ah Jian rushes to interject. \u201cBefore Fang Zhou come back, don\u2019t say a word about this matter outside and also don\u2019t go causing trouble. When Fang Zhou return, we can discuss what to do!\u201d\u201cCorrect! What Ah Jian said is right! That how the matter should be handled!\u201d Aunt Zhang unanimously agreedThird Aunt paused, then it came to her.If this matter was to be exposed, what reputation would she have left? Even though everyone knew deep down, it was Yang Family going overboard in the dissolved engagement matter and felt pity for her, but to say her reputation wasn\u2019t affected at all would be a lie.If including this matter, then it was really \u2014\u201cAlright! Alright! I was angered silly by that wicked woman!\u201d Third Aunt nodded at once, anxiously said, \u201cThis, we better quickly save Fang Zhou ah! What should we do!\u201dWith this said, Aunt Zhang started to be overwrought. Wang Ji Satin and Silk shop\u2019s Wang Family was a well-known wealthy household in town. To go to their house to find her, let\u2019s not mention they aren\u2019t going to admit, even entering their gate was a problem.\u201cLet me handle that. I\u2019ll enter town right now!\u201dAh Jian said.Third Aunt and Aunt Zhang looked at each other, spoke words like \u2018Be careful on the road!\u2019. Aunt Zhang couldn\u2019t resist asking, \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy to enter Wang Family\u2019s gate. After you reached the town, do you have any plans?\u201dOf course, the plan is to enter high, leave high! However, Ah Jian didn\u2019t voice it out, just uttered, \u201cI have my own plan. You can rest assured!\u201dEntering the town in the middle of the night required the Village head\u2019s written permission; otherwise, the town door won\u2019t open. Aunt Zhang and Third Aunt went to handle this matter, saying Lian Fang Zhou caught a fever and needed to invite a doctor from town. Zhang Li Zheng didn\u2019t make it hard for them.Ah Jian\u2019s pace was fast, he entered town about two hours before dawn.At this time, the streets already had early-rise ground sweepers, and a lot of roadside food stall had opened with the oil lamp on and was being busy.Ah Jian very quickly found out the address of Satin and Silk shop\u2019s Wang Family.Wang Family\u2019s inner yard has three part: a small garden, a left compound house, and a right compound house. It wasn\u2019t enormous, but it already counts as a rare find in town.Ah Jian did a simple inspection, then directly head to the stable.Usually, the driver would live near the stable area as it is more convenient to look after the horse.Ah Jian did not know why he knew these stuff, but he knew it as if it was a natural thing.He captured the driver and interrogated the direction of the Wang couple and Hua Jing Tao\u2019 s chamber out of him. After he made him faint, Ah Jian got closer to there while it was dark.As for Hua Jing Tao, she had anxiously speed back to Wang Manor with Lian Fang Zhou, ordered Xiao Yao-er and rough old woman to place Lian Fang Zhou on a couch in her own room\u2019s side room and instructed them to keep watch. While she, rushed to find Master to report happy news.Master Wang and Madam had already asleep. According to rationality, Hua Jing Tao should have brought it up in the next morning, but she was too thrilled. Feeling that she made great achievement and what\u2019s more Master dotes on her, she became unbridled.Madam Wang had long seen her as an eyesore. However, her Master likes her, so she can only endure.It went without saying, the maid that took vigil outside Madam Wang\u2019s room dislike Hua Jing Tao as well. So seeing her, who should be back tomorrow, returning in the middle of the night and also haughtily run over to Madam\u2019s bed to find Master. Simply not placing Madam in her eyes!The maid was deeply vexed and wasn\u2019t willing to go notify. Inside and out, her words were pushing Hua Jin Tao away and shooing her away. Hua Jin Tao was drunk on displaying her achievement, so how could she possibly leave? So she started arguing with that maid at the entrance.As they dispute, they had woken up Master Wang couple with all the noise.\u201cWhat is happening here? Which sane person would endlessly make noise in the middle of the night? If it spread out, what a sight it\u2019ll be!\u201d Madam Wang wore a middle garment with a tangerine feather and embroidered outer robe on top and had her hair loosely rolled up. Because she just got out of bed, her two cheeks were still rosy. At the sight of Hua Jin Tao, she extremely furious and gave her a vicious glare.Normally, Master Wang doted this young, beautiful concubine who knew how to be coquettish and showed worship. However, Madam\u2019s words were also logical. He pondered whether he spoiled her too much, so much that she acted like this!\u201cWhy did you come back during the middle of the night? Still not returning to your room? If there\u2019s a matter, talk about tomorrow! Go!\u201d Master Wang scowled in displeasure.\u201cMaster!\u201d Hua Jin Tao didn\u2019t put Master Wang\u2019s expression in her eyes. She quickly grinned, \u201cIf it was normally, this lowly concubine dare not disturb Master. This lowly concubine have an urgent matter to report to Master! Master, please let this lowly concubine speak, it\u2019ll only take a few sentences!\u201d\u201cNo matter how urgent, it is in the middle of the night! Why not early tomorrow?\u201d Madam Wang sneered, \u201cDon\u2019t use such a small matter to play around! Master is already tired out after a day of work. With this din of yours, how can Master\u2019s body take it? Now you\u2019re saying you\u2019re in the right!\u201dHua Jin Tao doesn\u2019t take Madam Wang\u2019s word seriously. She endured the scolding without changing her expression. Her pupils didn\u2019t slant toward her, rather the pair of pretty eyes eagerly looked at Master Wang.Seeing Hua Jin Tao like this, Master Wand sunk into contemplation. Then said, \u201cSpeak, what matter do you have?\u201d\u201cMaster!\u201d Madam Wang saw that Master Wand made her lose face in front of a concubine, she felt embarrassed as well as angry.\u201cYes.\u201d While Hua Jin Tao\u2019s brows loosened and eyes smiled. She curtsied, then approached Master Wang and whispered into Master Wang\u2019s ear. It was an obvious display of hiding from Madam Wang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Rescue (part 2)Madam Wang trembled in fury and ferociously shot daggers at Hua Jin Tao. If it weren\u2019t for personal maid, Yin Shuang\u2019s arm, there was a risk of flopping down due to anger.\u201cFor real?\u201d Master Wang\u2019s eyes lit up as excitement sprouted in his voice.\u201cNaturally, it\u2019s true!\u201d Hua Jin Tao happily declared as she quickly bobbed her head. She said, \u201cMaster, do you want to go see?\u201dMaster Wang pondered for a second. The important guest planned to leave Yun He County tomorrow, so the sooner this matter was settled, the better. Once the important guest is pleased, not only will the inventory be cheaper for his store but also, the style will be more trendy. This meant big business!\u201cLet\u2019s go have a look!\u201d At once, Master Wang became energetic. Then turned to Madam Wang, said, \u201cYou go sleep by yourself first! I have some matter to take care of!\u201dMadam Wang hated that she couldn\u2019t eat up Hua Jin Tao. But she knew she can\u2019t voice out objection at this time now that her husband has already spoken out. Otherwise, it\u2019ll have a reverse effect.She pushed herself to raised the corner of her lips to bare out a smiling face. She inclined her head, responded, \u201cGo then, Master! Don\u2019t catch a cold! Yin Shuang, quickly fetch a cloak over!\u201dHua Jin Tao couldn\u2019t resist stealing a glance at Madam Wang. She curled her lips in disdain, \u2018What endurance she got! But so what? All she can do is endure!\u2019Yin Shuang swiftly brought a silky brown feathered cloak with gold edge out. Madam Wang personally put it on Master Wang\u2019s shoulder, smiled, \u201cMaster, go ahead now! Rest early, don\u2019t tire yourself too much!\u201dMaster Wang was very pleased with how virtuous his wife was. He nodded with an \u201cEn\u201d an then took Hua Jin Tao with him.After Master Wang and Hua Jin Tao left, Madam\u2019s expression sank with a snap. Carrying a scowl, she sat down and spitefully scolded, \u201cThat little slut is too arrogant. Sooner or later, this madam will do my most to vent out this vexation with interest as well! You go, check what tricks that slut is up to!\u201dYin Shuang knew this instruction meant to go stealthily watch and eavesdrop. This wasn\u2019t the first time. She answered and hastily left.Actually, Lian Fang Zhou woke up during the journey. It\u2019s just that she dare not act rashly.She secretly sighed out in relief when she was laid in the room. She thought her opportunity to escape had arrived, but unexpectedly, that maid and old woman stood guard by her side. Her mind cried out in distress. She can only continue to wait and see what happens.\u201cMaster, it\u2019s here! Take your time!\u201d Hua Jin Tao charmingly curled her lips slightly. Xiao Yao-er and that old woman hastily stood up to go open the door.Lian Fang Zhou immediately relaxed the hand which was clenched at her side. She dared not act carelessly.Some footsteps came closer and mixed among it were a heavy rouge scent. Lian Fang Zhou slightly held her breath.\u201cIt\u2019s her?\u201d It was a middle-aged man\u2019s voice.\u201cYes, Master. Do you think she\u2019s suitable?\u201d An endearing young woman\u2019s voice sounded out. It was Hua Jin Tao, but Lian Fang Zhou doesn\u2019t recognize who she is.After a moment, she heard the man grunt in satisfaction. He beamed, \u201cTao-er is very capable. This girl is quite dewy, her appearance is a good draw, and her skin is white! Haha, not bad, not bad at all!\u201dAt these words, Lian Fang Zhou felt sick. She can approximately guess why they have captured her.Hua Jin Tao began simpering and appealingly said, \u201cNaturally, this concubine will put master\u2019s matter in first priority! Isn\u2019t this why this concubine dare not waste a single moment and hurry back so late in the night!\u201dMaster Wang had lost his head in exhilaration and forgot to ask. Now that Hua Jin Tao reminded him, he then questioned in puzzlement, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t mention it, I would have forgotten. Out of nowhere, why did you persist on returning in the middle of the night?\u201dHua Jin Tao paused. It goes without saying, she won\u2019t tell the truth. After all, the truth wasn\u2019t so pleasant to hear! She daintily complained, \u201cInitially I planned to return early tomorrow morning! However, I couldn\u2019t get Master\u2019s matter out of my mind! Since I couldn\u2019t sleep, might as well come back! Master, is it wrong for me to come back ahead of time?\u201d\u201cNo! Not wrong!\u201d Master Wang did not suspect anything with her explanation. He smilingly exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s that you\u2019re back! Haha, did you know, Boss Xiao is going to leave Yun He County tomorrow afternoon? Originally, I was worried about what kind of present to prepare for him! Your return was perfect timing! Haha!\u201dHua Jin Tao heard this and was overjoyed at the unexpected news, she clapped in delight and said, \u201cSuch a coincidence! This concubine and Master have, what that phrase\u2013\u201d\u201cOur hearts that beat in unison!\u201d Master Wang heartily laughed.\u201cRight! Right! Our hearts beat in unison!\u201d Hua Jin Tao delicately smiled. She continued to giving flatters, making Master Wang even merrier.\u201cWhy is this person still asleep? What\u2019s happened?\u201d Suddenly Master Wang slightly frowned in doubt and questioned.Hua Jin Tao lightly coughed, and lightly brushed over it with a smile. \u201cThis matter was decided by this girl\u2019s elder. The girl is a bit unruly, so her elder decided it\u2019s much more convenient to have her unconscious! Master, didn\u2019t Boss Xiao say he likes lively girls? Isn\u2019t this just perfect! Hehe, it couldn\u2019t be that a big boss like him can\u2019t even tame a rural girl?\u201dMaster Wang paused then laughed it off, not take it too seriously. He spoke, \u201cSince it\u2019s like that, early tomorrow, wake her up. Send someone to help bathe her and change into pretty clothes. Need to dress up well!\u201dHua Jin Tao quickly acknowledged with a smile. Afterward, she coyly called \u2018Master!\u2019 and then supported Master Wang to return to the bedchamber to rest.After hearing these words, a fire welled up in Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s heart. Now that they were leaving, she secretly let out a breath and wished for them to hurry up.Tomorrow morning, they\u2019ll send her over to whatever Boss Xiao\u2019s place. Afraid at that time, no matter whether she\u2019s awake or not, they will send her away. Meaning, the time she can use is quite limited.However, Heaven has no eyes. At that moment, some dust floated down from the ceiling and landed on Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s nose. Her nose immediately started itching. She endured it with all her might, but in the end, she wasn\u2019t able to restrain herself. \u2018ACHOO!\u2019 A resounding sneeze resonated.This sudden sneeze startled Master Wang, Hua Jin Tao and the servants. Few pairs of eyes simultaneously looked over at her.\u201cSo, you were awake! It\u2019s great that you\u2019re awake! Xiao Yao-er, Wu ma, you guys properly serve her! Miss Lian is an important person!\u201d After coming out of her shocked state, Hua Jin Tao instructed with a sneer, clearly not taking Lian Fang Zhou seriously at all.From her viewpoint, this was her own ground, so naturally, it was she who was in charge! Just an insignificant rural girl, how could she place her in her eyes?Xiao Yao-er and Wu ma jointly responded, \u201cYes!\u201dLian Fang Zhou\u2019s heart sank. She knew once this moment passed, she won\u2019t have another chance! Because she was on her own here, there was no one else that can help her!She swiftly turned her body and sat up. Not waiting for everyone to react, she flew like a wind toward Hua Jin Tao. Without warning, she pushed Master Wang away, then pulled Hua Jin Tao over, prised a golden hairpin out of Hua Jin Tao\u2019s hair and held it to her neck. She yelled, \u201cDon\u2019t move! Otherwise, don\u2019t blame me for being ruthless!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Rescue (part 3)Hua Jin felt pain at her neck, that was cool and sharp feeling dug into her skin. It made her trembled.So frightened, her legs weakened. With a white face, she leaned toward Master Wang to sought help. In a shaking voice, she cried out, \u201cMaster, save me, save me!\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou became more aggressive with her. She icily bellowed, \u201c You better behave! Even if I die, I will drag a scapegoat down with me!\u201dHua Jin Tao lips quivered as she became more and more terrified. She dared not make a single sound.Master Wang squinted his eyes, he examined Lian Fang Zhou with great interest. Sure enough, this girl\u2019s personality is truly wild and spicy! And what\u2019s more, after waking up, she appeared more vibrant than before. Especially those eyes, it glowed brightly. It got a unique allure to it.Seeing Master Wang acting silently and calmly, Lian Fang Zhou heart sank. It appeared that he doesn\u2019t care about the life or death of his concubine! This was terrible!If it was really like that, then even if she has a hostage at hand, she might not be able to leave their gate. Dawn had yet arrived, so who knows how much longer can she grab hold of this b***h?As time go on, there will be times when she carelessly loosened her grip. And if by chance, they capture the opportunity, then she won\u2019t be able to have a chance to be liberated!The situation was really bad, but Lian Fang Zhou still wanted to give it a try. She can only take a gamble! Taking the chance while her current mental state and strength are at its best.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want her to die, get out of the way!\u201dLian Fang Zhou glared at Master Wang as she yelled.However, Master Wang just burst into laughter and did not budge an inch.Lian Fang Zhou placed more strength into the hand that gripped the gold hairpin. Pain radiated from Hua Jin Tao\u2019s neck, then a warm fluid ooze out of the skin could be felt. It was blood.Scared out of her mind, she broke into screams, \u201cMaster, save me! Master, save me!\u201dXiao Yao-er and the old woman expression were white. They froze at their spot with their mind turned silly.Master Wang glanced at Hua Jin Tao. In the end, she was his beloved concubine, he couldn\u2019t bear to see her hurt. He retreated to the side, then ordered Xiao Yao-er and the old woman to make way. On the other hand, hs spoke to Lian Fang Zhou pleasantly. \u201cMiss, don\u2019t mess around! Do you think you can leave our Wang Family\u2019s gate? Obediently put down the gold hairpin, and I\u2019ll let this matter off! You came to have a good life. From now on, you\u2019ll eat fragrantly and drink merrily, decked in gold and silver and have servants attending you. Isn\u2019t it better than days in the countryside?\u201dMaster Wang heart started itching. At this moment, he was pondering whether to gift the person to Manager Xiao or leave her for himself? After thinking it through, he endured the pain and cut off his desire. After all, the benefit of wealth is more important than women!Lian Fang Zhou sneered. Gripping Hua Jin Tao, she carefully maneuvered to the entrance one step at a time. She warned coldly, \u201cYou better not play anything! Otherwise, with a slip of a hand, who knows what will happen!\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t! I won\u2019t! You, no matter what don\u2019t move your hand! No matter what! \u201dHua Jin Tao was deathly pale, she agitatedly said.It was important to help the Master get on the important guest\u2019s good side. However, her own life was even more important!Like this, Lian Fang Zhou gripped onto Hua Jin Tao as she walked step by step out of the door. Just a short distance of twenty-thirty steps, felt as if she used all her strength. So stressed that her back was sweating and arms were aching.Holding a hostage, particularly in enemies\u2019 den, wasn\u2019t an easy task.\u201cWhere\u2019s the main gate? Take me there!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou lowered the gold hairpin in her hand, and coldly demanded, \u201cYou better behave, don\u2019t go playing tricks!\u201d\u201cI dare not! I dare not!\u201dHua Jin Tao\u2019s voice trembled, then guided Lian Fang Zhou one step at a time.Master Wang also came out. The maid and old woman behind him steadily followed Lian Fang Zhou.Lian Fang Zhou pinched her brows, roared, \u201cYou stay there! Not allowed to come over!\u201dThis time Master Wang didn\u2019t comply with her words. Preserving a calm appearance, he spoke, \u201cThat won\u2019t do. What if you hurt my beloved concubine? Miss, since you whole-heartedly wish to leave, then I won\u2019t force you. Release my beloved concubine, and I\u2019ll let you go!\u201dNaturally, Lian Fang won\u2019t believe his words. She coldly glanced at him and made no sound. There was nothing she can do if he persists on following.Just like that, the few of them slowly made their way out. As they were passing the greenery and rockery, Hua Jin Tao\u2019s eyes spun.\u201cAH!\u201d A sudden shriek sounded out. She loudly cried, \u201cMouse! There\u2019s a mouse!\u201dLian Fang Zhou\u2019s mind was constantly under high concentration and angst, so she was feeling a bit exhausted and became deeply alarmed by this shriek of Hua Jin Tao. Taking advantage of this moment, Hua Jin Tao broke away from her and bolted to the side. As she ran, she screamed, \u201cCatch her! Capture that dead girl!\u201dImmediately Xiao Yao-er and that old woman dashed toward Lian Fang Zhou, while yelling, \u201c Somebody! Come! Thief! Catch the thief!\u201dMaster Wang laughed with delight.Lian Fang Zhou stamped her feet. She promptly made a decision and randomly chose a direction to run.Xiao Yao-er and that old woman immediately chase after. Not long later, few old women on night duty joined in. Master Wang and half frightened to death Hua Jin Tao also followed behind.Luckily in the inner households, there\u2019s no footboy and male servant. Otherwise, Lian Fang Zhou couldn\u2019t have run far.After running for a while, Lian Fang Zhou bitterly wept due to the surrounding scenery. She had run into Wang Family\u2019s back garden!In front was a two mu, square-shaped pond. The edge was a zig-zag bridge that meanders through the water and connected to a cornice pavilion in the middle of the pond.At the sight of people behind catching up and people blocking ahead, she was under the circumstance of being outflanked. She had no paths other than that pavilion.Lian Fang Zhou\u2019s heart became cold. It couldn\u2019t be that she\u2019ll have to die today?Her survival instinct made her head for that pavilion. If it\u2019s not the end yet, she will not give up.It was till this moment, she finally understood how tiny her strength was as an individual. Understood what was called heaven give no answer, the earth gives no help (a.k.a nowhere to turn for help)!This pond was neither too big or too small. Even if she jumped in, there would be people pulling her out! If she falls into their hand, then she\u2019ll have to leave Yunhe County tomorrow! After leaving, she as a little woman, and furthermore in the ancient era, it\u2019ll be as hard as ascending to heaven to return back here.Lian Fang Zhou was in despair as well as in a fury. \u2018Mrs. Qiao!\u2019She swore, if she somehow escapes today\u2019s misfortune, she will not let Mrs. Qiao off! Definitely not!\u201cStop right there.\u201d When Master Wang saw that Lian Fang Zhou ran to the pavilion, he was delighted. This was shooting a fish in a barrel ah unless she can grow wings and fly! Therefore, he slowly opened his mouth and stopped the maid and old women who were chasing her.Hua Jin Tao rubbed her neck which stung in pain, spoke with full of hatred, \u201cMaster, what are you waiting for! Quickly order people to capture that wretch! I want to see how she resist now!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Confrontation (part 1)\u201cNo rush,\u201d Master Wang lightly patted her hand, laughed, \u201cMiss ah, as you can see, I\u2019m not pressuring you. It\u2019s better that you obediently come over! Even if you jump, you won\u2019t be able to escape! Look here, didn\u2019t I say? You can\u2019t escape! So why bother?\u201dLian Fang Zhou remained silent and just coldly stared at him.Master Wang pay no heed to it, he shook his head and lightly sighed as he grinned, \u201cWhy bother! Really why! To refuse a toast, only to drink a forfeit, Miss isn\u2019t a smart person!\u201dHua Jin Tao shot daggers at Lian Fang Zhou as if she wanted to eat her alive. She stamped her feet, \u201cThis wild girl is someone that needs to be taught a lesson! Why is Master still be polite with her! Quickly capturing her is the right method! Master, watch carefully! Watch how this concubine teaches her a lesson! I will definitely make her docile!\u201dMaster Wang turned to Lian Fang Zhou, said, \u201cYou hear that? This is your last chance! You come over now, we\u2019ll let bygones be bygones. Otherwise\u2026\u201dHe finished with a snicker.At these words, Hua Jin Tao spirit rose as Master Wang was silently agreeing with her words. She pointed at Lian Fang Zhou, yelled, \u201cCapture her for me! No need to be polite!\u201dIf it wasn\u2019t for the fact that they have to gift her away tomorrow morning, Hua Jin Tao would definitely stab the golden hairpin at her a few times for revenge.Even though she can\u2019t let her body be injured, she still didn\u2019t plan to let her off easily!How could she not be furious and want to regain her standing after suffering in front of the servants? But she forgot that she too was born as a country girl!The maids and the old women knew concubine Hua was heavily doted by Master. So at her words, they clamored and dashed over without any objection as they wanted to curry Mistress Hua\u2019s favor by capturing Lian Fang Zhou.Lian Fang Zhou didn\u2019t want to go down without putting a fight, so she tried to plunge out. Around half a dozen of six maids and old women rushed in together. Since the pavilion was small and such a large crowd pushing around, no progress was made. In a moment, they were not able to capture Lian Fang Zhou. Instead, two of them got pushed down by her. Those who were pushed down became stunned and caused their colleague to trip and stumble. It was chaos as the pavilion was filled with shriek and curse.One person found an opening and grasped Lian Fang Zhou by the waist. She loudly exclaimed, \u201cCaptured! I got her! Quickly help out!\u201dForced into a corner, Lian Fang Zhou repeatedly pinched so hard that her finger nearly broke. That old woman did not loosen her grip as she endured pain and howled.Before her eyes, she saw another person dashing over. Anxious, Lian Fang Zhou lowered her head with her mouth open to bite.Unexpectedly, she had yet to bite down, when the woman grasping her tragically screamed. She exerted her strength to break free and then pushed her away.And happened to crash into the woman who was rushing over. The two of them yelped in surprise as they fell backward together.Additionally, another two people who were bolting over also tragically yelled for an unknown reason and staggered into a fall.Seeing the situation, Lian Fang Zhou was overjoyed. She hurriedly held up her skirt and then dashed toward the edge.Master Wang and Hua Jin Tao froze and widened their eyes in surprise.This girl\u2019s personality isn\u2019t wild, but an extraordinarily wild. It was simply too\u2013 courageous!Master Wang\u2019s gaze sank. He decided to take the matter into his own hands. But before his feet could move, he felt a something was placed against his waist. A male\u2019s cold and cheerless voice icily sounded from behind him. \u201cMaster Wang, you better not move!\u201dMaster Wang\u2019s body shivered. He forced himself to be calm and steadily asked, \u201cWho are you? How did you enter?\u201dThe outer yards\u2019 wall was as much as six-meters tall and as well as that, the courtyards had people keeping night watch and vicious hounds. No thief had ever entered Wang Household. To suddenly have an outsider coming at this time and what\u2019s more, approached his behind without him detecting, how could it not make his heart chill?Needless to say, the one who has entered was Ah Jian. Ah Jian snorted, disdainfully replied, \u201cI want to enter, then I can easily enter!\u201dMaster Wang and Hua Jin Tao did not see Ah Jian. However, Lian Fang Zhou did. Now, she can guess the reason for the women\u2019s loosening grip and fall down.Her heart relaxed. Her spirit grew. She revealed an enormous grin at Ah Jian as she dashed over to him!\u201cMaster, quickly capture her! Quickly! Don\u2019t let her escape!\u201d Hua Jin Tao was so focused on Lian Fang Zhou, she didn\u2019t notice her Master had already been captured by someone.As Hua Jin Tao cried out, she dashed forward to grab onto Lian Fang Zhou, but as a woman living in leisure, she was no match for Lian Fang Zhou. And what\u2019s more, she wasn\u2019t going all out like Lian Fang Zhou.Lian Fang Zhou threw out a leg and mercilessly kicked Hua Jin Tao\u2019s stomach. It never crossed Hua Jin Tao\u2019s mind that not only did she not dodge it, but instead meet it head-on. She really suffered from this kick and tragically screamed out as she collapsed to the ground.\u201cMaster! Ah\u2013 Who, who are you!?\u201d Hua Jin Tao\u2019s tone became shocked. Only now, did she see Ah Jian beside Master Wang and also the dagger held to Master Wang\u2019s waist.\u201cAh Jian! You finally came!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou ran over. Her eyes couldn\u2019t help but become moist as she looked at Ah Jian.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Ah Jian faintly smiled, gave her a reassuring nod.\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou shook her head. She took a deep breath and coldly voiced out, \u201cHowever, need to have a good discussion with Master Wang couple!\u201dAh Jian inclined his head and said, \u201cMaster Wang, can we step to the side and talk?\u201dMaster Wang bitterly smiled. Did he have any other choice?Lian Fang Zhou swept a cold glance to Hua Jin Tao who had fallen to the ground, icily hollered, \u201cAnd you as well!\u201dIt was already the next morning when Lian Fang Zhou and Ah Jian returned to Da Fang Village.When Lian Fang Zhou and Ah Jian rushed to Lian Li\u2019s and Mrs. Qiao\u2019s home, Mrs. Qiao was feeding the chicken. Seeing Lian Fang Zhou burst in with a cold expression and seething with killing intent, it startled her so much that the chicken feed in her hand fell onto the ground with a bang. Shocked, she exclaimed, \u201cHow, how did you come back?\u201d\u201cNaturally, you don\u2019t want me to return!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou declared with hate. \u201cAunt, to heartlessly sell me, how did I offend you? After selling me, you can easily order around my siblings and easily take over our family land!\u201d\u201cWhat happened! What happened!\u201d Lian Li came out from inside and at the sight of Lian Fang Zhou, his expression also slightly changed.Mrs. Qiao glared at Lian Fang Zhou with incomparable resentment, shouted, \u201cTime and time again, you contradict me. You don\u2019t place me, the elder, in your eyes! Heaven has no eyes for letting you come back!\u201d\u201cYou seized our family\u2019s grain, occupied our family\u2019s field, and even wanted to take ten liang, our whole living expense that came from dissolving my engagement. How can I not refuse you? This is called contradict? You want to force us, siblings to die, then you\u2019ll be happy? We didn\u2019t beg you to look after us, nor did we borrow a single grain or a piece of vegetable. So how did we bother you? If you don\u2019t give an explanation for last night\u2019s matter, I won\u2019t let it drop!\u201dLian Fang Zhou pointed at her as she angrily demanded.\u201cHa!\u201d Mrs. Qiao laughed toward the sky, said, \u201cYou won\u2019t let it drop? So what if you don\u2019t let it go? Hmph, say that I sold you? As long as I deny it, nobody would believe it! Go give it a try. I also need to divulge to people how you don\u2019t respect your elders!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You are simply confounding black and white!\u201d Lian Fang Zhou pointed at her as she spoke in fury. \u201cI\u2019m not going to waste my breath with you. We\u2019ll go to clarify it in front of li zheng and the village elders! I believe there\u2019s still justice in the world!\u201d\u201cYou think I\u2019m afraid of you?\u201d Mrs. Qiao pointed at her with a sneer. \u201cSo what if you bring it up to them! Hmph, you think they would believe a little girl\u2019s word?\u201d\u201cFang Zhou ah!\u201d At this time, Lian Li steadily interjected. \u201cAbout this matter, your Aunt was muddled-headed. You came back perfectly fine! So, let this matter pass and not mention it anymore, ok? I have already scolded your Aunt. From now on, she won\u2019t do these foolish things! Ah?\u201dLian Li lightly pulled on Mrs. Qiao\u2019s sleeve and with his eyes signaled her toward Ah Jian a few times.At first, Mrs. Qiao wasn\u2019t willing and wanted to continue ranting but seeing Ah Jian, she remembered last night\u2019s suffering and immediately felt her arms were aching. Her heart trembled. She faintly harrumphed and not speak anymore.Lian Fang Zhou was amused by Lian Li\u2019s word that was laced with \u2018affableness\u2019 and \u2018affectionateness\u2019. She coldly smiled, \u201cUncle! In other words, you also have a part in this? Aunt created a barrier. You and my father are brothers with the same mother! I am your blood-related niece. You actually have the conscience to do this!? Are you not letting down my father? In a hundred year, do you have the face to meet my father? And my grandfather and grandmother?\u201dAt her words, Lian Li felt embarrassed and reprimanded, \u201cWhat nonsense are you saying! Didn\u2019t I say? I only knew about this matter afterward! I had already scolded your Aunt, so what do you still want? Child, why can\u2019t you forgive the person in the wrong? No matter how wrong your aunt is, she is still your elder!\u201dLian Fang Zhou icily declared, \u201cIs the thing she done something an elder would do!? Uncle, if the same situation happened to Cousin, would you say the same thing?\u201d\u201cPah! \u201d Without waiting for her to finish, Mrs. Qiao continuously spat. She agitatedly glared at her with hostility and denounced, \u201cYou jinx, what nonsense are saying!\u201dLian Fang Zhou harrumphed, \u201cHeart to heart, you are vicious enough! You can do this to your niece, while for your own son, not even allowed to talk about it! Aunt, I won\u2019t let it drop like this. Come, you and I need to bring this up to li zheng and the village elders!\u201dAs she spoke, Lian Fang Zhou reached out to drag Mrs. Qiao.Lian Li hurried to block her. With a frown, he said, \u201cChild, why are you so stubborn? If this matter gets out, what benefit would there be for you?\u201d\u201cAt least it\u2019ll let you know that even without parents, I, Lian Fang Zhou, isn\u2019t easy to bully! You did such a thing and ruined the whole village\u2019s reputation, li zheng and village elders are bound to give me justice! What?\u201d She sneered, \u201cYou have the gut to do it, but none to admit it?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t go!\u201d Mrs. Qiao snorted. \u201cThis lady won\u2019t admit it, so what can you do to me! Those few still-not-dead-yet will help a silly little girl? Don\u2019t be so dumb!\u201d\u201cMrs. Lian-Qiao, you are simply downright rude and utterly shameless!\u201d Following that angry bellow, was the sight of li zheng and the three respectable elders coming inside. Each face was colder than the other. Lian Ze was also at the side with a fuming expression.Lian Li and Mrs. Qiao never expected Lian Fang Zhou to use this kind of method. Their face paled from fright.Lain Li was so remorseful that his mouth was bitter. He knew something wasn\u2019t right. This lass came back after suffering such a great grievance, unexpectedly wanted to reason things out instead of causing a ruckus! So this is why, so this is why!\u201cLi, li zheng! Third Great Uncle Zhang, Fifth Great Uncle Zhang, Great Grandfather Li, why did, you, come!\u201d Lian Li did his utmost best to put on a smiling face. But no matter how it looked, it appeared forced.Zhang li zheng and the others remained silent, while their expression was ugly.\u201cAccused! I\u2019ve been accused!\u201d Mrs. Qiao loudly yelled with a sob. \u201cLi zheng ah and few great uncles ah, you have to give me justice! This heartless dead girl set a trap and tricked me!\u201dZhang Li Zheng just coldly swept a glance toward her, said, \u201cDare not. How could us still-not-dead-yet give you justice? What\u2019s more, if it\u2019s accused or not, didn\u2019t you say it just now? The words you personally said, have you forgotten? Us still-not-dead-yet\u2019s ears aren\u2019t deaf yet!\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that. I was speaking in anger. It was words said in the moment of rage!\u201d Mrs. Qiao cried. \u201cI was enraged by this dead girl! This girl\u2019s eyes never had us two elders in her eyes. What I said, said was to purposely make her mad! I\u2013\u201d\u201cEnough!\u201d Third Great Uncle Zhang coughed once. He spoke neither fast or slow, \u201cLeave all the talk for when we are at li zheng\u2019s home! Let\u2019s go!\u201dFinishing, the few old men and Zhang li zheng turned to leave. Zhang li zheng called for Lian Fang Zhou and Ah Jian.Lian Fang Zhou and Ah Jian followed them.\u201cHusband, this, what do we do!\u201d What do we do!\u201d Mrs. Qiao was going mad from angst.\u201cYou stinky old woman with a loose mouth!\u201d Lian Li was stamping his feet and fiercely scolded, \u201cWhat to do? Who told your stinky mouth to be not careful and say irresponsible things!\u201d\u201cI, how could I know those still-\u2026\u2026they would be outside!\u201d Mrs. Qiao was mad and worried. She aggressively spat out, \u201cThat dead girl is too crafty. She planned a trap to harm me!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019ll see after we go over! I\u2019m warning you, you better behave! If you dare speak irresponsibly again, hmph, I won\u2019t forgive you!\u201d Lian Li coldly said.\u201cGo where? I\u2019m not going!\u201d Mrs. Qiao expression whitened and unconsciously retreated back.\u201cNot going? Now you know you to be afraid! Going or not, it\u2019s not up to you!\u201d Lian Li coldly snorted, grabbed her arm and forcefully dragged her.Seeing Hua Jin Tao at li zheng home\u2019s slant hall, Mrs. Qiao expression turned white and was so close to fainting.\u201cWhat words do you still have to say?\u201d Zhang li zheng icily stared at Mrs. Qiao.\u201cKneel! You vicious woman!\u201d Lian Li shouted and pushed Mrs. Qiao.Mrs. Qiao dare not disobey. After a slight delay, she kneeled down with a lowered head. But her mouth kept on crying out, \u201cAccusation! Accusation!\u201d\u201cSeem like, you really are treating us still-not-dead-yet deaf ah!\u201d Zhang li zheng\u2019s and the others\u2019 expression was extremely ugly. Their anger gradually rose and was full of loath.Everybody had heard of the Lian Family\u2019s matter between the two branches. So when Lian Fang Zhou brought over Hua Jin Tao to complain in tears in the early morning, how could they not give judgment for her as li zheng and village elders?\u201cYou shut up!\u201d Lian Li fiercely glared at Mrs. Qiao. With an apologetic smile, he spoke, \u201cThis woman, this woman doesn\u2019t have much experience. Li zheng and few great uncles forgive this time! This time she was muddle-headed! She shouldn\u2019t have done this foolish thing!\u201dThird Great Uncle Zhang coldly harrumphed, \u201cThis sounds like human words! Mrs. Lian-Qiao, do you know your wrong?\u201dBeing glared by Lian Li, Mrs. Qiao hung down her head and quietly admitted, \u201cI, I know my mistake!\u201dHer heart was filled with extreme rage from suffering such embarrassment in front of Lian Fang Zhou.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You will be punished to kneel for a day and night outside the ancestral temple, and promise not to make such mistakes in the future. In the future, take care of your nephews and prostitutes, are you willing?\u201dA woman is not qualified to knell inside the ancestral temple, and she can only knell in the yard outside. It is uncomfortable to knell outside for one day and night in such kind of weather. Uncle Zhang San hated her for cunning and bad heart, and even more annoyed that she called him a few times \u201cold enough but not dead\u201d and made it clear that he wanted to punish her.Qiao had listened to this punishment, and thought kneeling outside the ancestral temple and making a guarantee were OK. Only letting her \u201ctake more care of\u201d Lian Fangzhou and her siblings from now on was like a sharp hedgehog stinging her heart.Just imagine that in the future, Fangzhou\u2019s siblings will go to her house for care and things frequently made her feel crazy.\u201cThey also have fields and houses and there are others who take care of them from time to time. Heng, even give them the charcoal! Anyone else have such treatment? They are not satisfied? I still have to take care of them? What is this called! I still have a son to feed and teach, and a lot of my own things are not finished yet. How can I take care of others? Who will take care of me?\u201dQiao said a lot, and stared at Lian Fangzhou with a sneer: \u201cI took care of her, but they did not appreciate it! They even made unfounded countercharges and framed me! Hey, is it not good like Grandmother Hua Yi? I just managed to say many good words for her. Is it not good to living a well-being for being a concubine! Looking at this bad girl, who had never said thanks to me, but took me as an enemy! No conscience!\u201dLian Fangzhou was speechless. she cheated her, and she had to thank her!\u201cAunt Qiao, don\u2019t talk nonsense!\u201d Hua Jintao stood still and kept silent. She listened to Qiao\u2019s words and said, \u201cWhat do you mean to be a concubine? Why don\u2019t I know? I said inadvertently that I wanted to buy a girl, you wanted to sell Fangzhou to me and also promised that she was willing to get into my carriage. I didn\u2019t ask on the road. When I got home, I realized that it was not the case! She has a good life and there are brothers and sisters to take care of. How can you do this kind of thing! She is nephew! Fortunately, my husband and I are not overbearing so I sent her back!\u201dQiao was stunned!Lian Fangzhou did not wait for her reaction and rushed to cry: \u201cElder aunt, you are so heartless! First sell me to be a slave, then are you going to sell my younger brothers and sisters! You are bullying us to separate us. Are you are not afraid of my mother in the heaven leave no peace! Sell us, and then take our house and fields, you play a good calculation! You also cheated me that you had found a good job for me in the county and let me go with Grandmother Hua Yi, this is the good job what you said?\u201d\u201cLian Qiao, do you have anything to say!\u201d village head Zhang stroke the table heavily.Selling nephew to people as slaves, and then seeking land, how poisonous the woman\u2019s mind is! And village head Zhang and others thought that only Qiao can really do this kind of thing!Seeing that she was so arrogant at this time, people knew that this woman is not a good one.\u201cI didn\u2019t! I didn\u2019t!\u201d Qiao screamed and shouted: \u201cThey wronged me! Hey! The squeaky girls whose surname is Hua, we agreed before, you actually bite me back! You must die!\u201d\u201cYou listen, this person is a mad man!\u201d Hua Jintao\u2019s face was very darken, she said: \u201cYes, we agreed before, but I don\u2019t know that you cheated me, you are lying to me! What about the ten silvers? You return it to me now!\u201dQiao screamed: \u201cTen silvers? It is clearly five!\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s five. This is what you admit, and return it to me!\u201d Hua Jintao said: \u201cjust five silvers. I don\u2019t care about it. You don\u2019t have to give it back to me. Give it to Fangzhou who was shocked!\u201dLian Fangzhou said faintly: \u201cI don\u2019t want any money, I just want a word from elder aunt!\u201d\u201cYou dig a pit and let me to jump in! You are utterly devoid of conscience!\u201d Qiao swore.But she really can\u2019t do anything to Hua Jintao The communication between the two people last night was a confession, only a sneak peek, and it was not straightforward. At this time, Qiao can\u2019t say no even if Hua Jintao wanted to deny!Lian Li wanted to yell at her when Qiao started talking, but the elders in the village glanced over and told him to stand by, and he could only listen to it.At this time, he couldn\u2019t bear it. He knew that Qiao\u2019s talk would get even worse. Then he shouted, \u201cShut up! You don\u2019t know how to be a good woman!\u201dQiao was teased by Hua Jintao and were forced to suffer in silence. She was even bullied by Lian Fangzhou. He broiled with anger. He saw that Lian Li did not stand on her side to help herself out, but he taught herself more, which made her go crazy. Pointing at Lian Li, she said: \u201cYou are an old thing that should die soon! You said nice words, but when something goes wrong, I am alone to bear the responsibility! You said much behind closed doors! You hate this girl much more than me. You wish she was far away from you, what do you pretend! You pretend to be like this, will she call you elder uncle!\u201d\u201cFuck, you are crazy! What crazy things did you say!\u201d Lian Li was angry and anxious, and he was going to fight Qiao.Ah Jian, who had never said anything just now stopped him lightly and whispered: \u201cIn front of the village head and elders, even uncle Lian is not so mad!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s none of your damn business! Our family\u2019s business have nothing to do with you!\u201d Lian Li snorted.\u201cCan I manage it?\u201d Uncle Zhang said coldly: \u201cIs she crazy? Is she talking crazy words? We elders are not muddled! If you don\u2019t feel guilty, stand on the side!\u201dLian Li said he did not dare to do so and stared at Ah Jian. He had to draw back to the side and swore Qiao in his heart.Qiao spitted to him and stared at him. She turned to point at village head Zhang and sneered: \u201cI know it! You are a group with the damn girl! You want to help her bully me. She sent several charcoals to your home, and everybody knows that! I am too poor to send you anything, how can I blame others do not treat me as a human and wrong me! God, open your eyes! I am wronged, I am wronged!\u201dQiao cried loudly, and the meaning was very obvious. It was clear that she thought Lian Fangzhou bribed village head Zhang and deliberately bullied her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This damn woman will stop till he is dead!She wants to die, so die alone, without implicating him!Village chief Zhang is a village official, and the master in Dafang Village! If he wants to put someone on spot, the one will get more than he bargained for!He was afraid that he has to apologize to Zhang and give him some money to cool him off.But even if he dissipates his anger, he will still feel uncomfortable about this thing . If there is anything related to this in the future, he will also be unfortunate.This damn woman, that stinky mouth!Once there happened something in the past, Lian Li always hided behind to pretend to be a good person, letting Mrs. Qiao swearing out. This time, he finally tasted the bitter fruit.\u201cYou\u2013\u201d Zhang was so angry that his face was pale. He stared at Mrs. Qiao and did not know what to say.Although he was angry, he had not lost his mind. The thing Lian Fangzhou sent charcoal to his family was true which was said by his own families. When Mrs. Qiao said this, he really can\u2019t argue more, for it will only be more and more unclear.To be honest, if this thing did not develop like this, even Lian Fangzhou asked him to invite the elders to take the lead, and asked them to listen at the door of the Lian Li\u2019s family, he would not have promised so fast and not discounted. .\u201cElder Aunt! You want to hate me, it\u2019s my suffering, but you shouldn\u2019t frame others!\u201d Lian Fangzhou cried: \u201cYes, I sent some charcoal to village chief Zhang, Zhang needed to dry the diapers and clothers of his little grandson at home by burning charcoals. I happened to have some charcoals, why can\u2019t I give him? What\u2019s more, my siblings are still young, and there are no relatives to help me. If there is anything trouble in the future, uncle Zhang can help to say something fair, isn\u2019t that okay!\u201dLian Fangzhou knew that the charcoal he had sent was used on it. She said this now to show that she was completely for caring for the children.Children are more expensive through the ages, and there is nothing to say to send something to the children! The clothes are hard to be dried in winter and it\u2019s reasonable to send some extra charcoals out.And asking for help to say a few fair words made people feel sad.Zhang sighed: \u201cFangzhou, you poor girl are really too careful! Since I am the chief of this village, I have to uphold justice! This is inevitable!\u201dLian Fangzhou said frankly: \u201cThat\u2019s the case, but I don\u2019t have a backbone in my family. I am upset! I just want to ask for a peace of mind! Besides, charcoal is enough to use, sending something extra to people is a matter of fairness! I really don\u2019t understand why the elder aunt frame me! But I implicated you, uncle!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t say this!\u201d Zhang said: \u201cAs you said, this is not a thing that can\u2019t be said! You are conscientious of doing these things! Don\u2019t be afraid!\u201dLian Fangzhou nodded and said to Mrs. Qiao: \u201cElder aunt, you said I had sent charcoals to uncle Zhang, but I also sent charcoals to you and my elder uncle! Will you not admit it? I want to respect you as elders, but you sold me out! It\u2019s really chilling!\u201dMrs. Qiao was stunned and said: \u201cYou damn girl, I wondered you are so kind and unreasonable to give us charcoal! You started with a bad heart! Hey, If you really respect us as elders, why did you refuse me to pick up a few vegetables in your garden? And the charcoals, you gave it to the village chief, but you didn\u2019t give it to the elders!\u201dLian Fangzhou took the initiative to give her charcoal, it was just because she knew that she would say something ugly after she gave it to Zhang, but she did not expect the effect received today was so unexpected.She choked: \u201cElder aunt, what are you saying! I have a good heart, but in your words, I am a bad girl! As you said, I expected that you would sell me, I expected people to send me back for good heart, and to be confronted with the elders and village chief. You are too overbearing! You have a vegetable garden, why should you pick my family\u2019s vegetables? Our family\u2019s food is just enough to eat. If there is extra vegetables, how can I not give you! As for charcoals, aunt Zhang had sent some to the elders, knowing that they are afraid of cold, it is a wish!\u201d\u201cLian Li, you listen to it yourself, what are you r wife talking about! I am too flustered to listen to it!\u201d The elders all said angrily. This damn woman even involved them into this thing! Did she think no one can control her?Lian Li\u2019s face had already been red for a while, and he was so angry that he slapped Mrs. Qiao in the face. When he saw she was going to fight back, he shouted, \u201cStop! Or I will divorce you!\u201dMrs. Qiao was stunned. She sit on the ground and slapped her thighs and cried.Zhang and the elders have never met such a shrew. There are some shrews in the village, but they all behaved themselves in front of them?Shrew like Mrs. Qiao, it\u2019s really the first time to see!They all became very angry.In fact, Mrs. Qioa will not dare to be so troublesome generally, but in front of Lian Fangzhou, plus the previous grievance, who can hold it?In the past, they bullied Lian families. While now the thing changed. This thing made her very angry.Uncle Zhang San coughed a little, patting on the table and said: \u201cIt seems that today\u2019s things can\u2019t be done. Mrs. Lian Qiao, you don\u2019t even respect us. It\u2019s not surprising for you to sell nephews. Are you going to make trouble? Well, let\u2019s find a quiet place for you. When you calm down, let\u2019s continue discussing this thing!\u201dThere are several small wing rooms next to each ancestral temple. There are no windows. Only a narrow and small window is opened. The door is closed and the inside is dark and cold. It is specially used to temporarily hold up some people who have made mistakes and are waiting to be disposed of.Because of the conditions of this small house, generally bot be used to close people inside.The meaning of uncle Zhang San is to shut Mrs. Qiao in.The screaming Mrs. Qiao\u2019s face turned pale, and the whole person suddenly froze, and the crying also came to an abrupt end.Being locked into the little dark house is not only cold, but even if she is released, no one will respect her anyone! Mrs. Qiao was really scared and regretful.She didn\u2019t regret anything else, but she shouldn\u2019t frame and involve the elders and the village chief.Frightened and scared, she returned to be a little calm, but even hated Lian Fangzhou more, and she was determined to be harmed by Lain Fangzhou.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If you don\u2019t make trouble, let\u2019s continue discussing about the previous things! We have never had such a sinister thing in Dafang village! Your nephew did not eat your food or wear your clothes, while you sold her without any reason. What else can you not do? Someday, if one child pass by your door, will you also catch and sell him? How do people from other villages look at our village!\u201dMrs. Qiao\u2019s head bowed and didn\u2019t dare to speak.Lian Li smiled: \u201cThe damn woman is muddled, uncles and village chief just ignore her! You decide how to punish her! We will follow your order, we must do it, we have to apologize to you!\u201dUncle Zhang San and others snorted and exchanged a look, showing a certain satisfaction.Uncle Zhang Wu coldly said: \u201cIsn\u2019t it all said at the beginning? Lian Qiao kneels outside the ancestral hall for one day and one night, and promised not to commit any crimes from now on. In the future, you both have to spend more time caring for Fangzhou and her siblings!\u201d\u201cOK, OK! We will do it, we must do it!\u201d Lian Li nodded and promised.\u201cUncles! Uncle Zhang!\u201d Lian Fangzhou kneel toward Zhang and solemnly said: \u201cAs for the uncle and the aunt to take care of us, I have received the heart, but I never dare to receive it!\u201d\u201cFangzhou, what are you doing!\u201d Lian Li said: \u201cGet up! You can rest assured that from now on, we will take care of you as our own child! You will never let you suffer a little bit of grievance! \u201dMrs. Qiao heard that and couldn\u2019t help but stared at Lian Li, while she didn\u2019t dare to oppose it.She did not know what Lian Li was planning. Lian Li had been pondering this matter. Taking care of Lian Fangzhou is actually not bad! In this way, it is possible to take her family\u2019s fields in their own name! There is also a share of the charcoal with the Li family, and he can order more people.Anyway, as long as he do things well and leave no reason to be accused, who can they do?Everyone has their own life to go through, not need to stare at their family! Besides, when you close the door to live, who can know anything?Can Lian Fangzhou go to Zhang and elders for complaining them? people will be impatient if she tells on them to much!But he did not expect Lian Fangzhou will refuse!\u201cFangzhou, you can rest assured, we all look at them! I believe that after today\u2019s events, they have learned the lesson! They absolutely can\u2019t make any more outrageous things! You don\u2019t have an elder in your family, it\u2019s really not very good!\u201d uncle Zhang San and others also said.\u201ci know uncles are kind, but we really want to live by ourselves!\u201d When Lian Fangzhou spoke again, Lian Ze also squatted at her side, saying: \u201cMy sister talking right! Elder uncle and aunt have to take care of their children. My sister and I are not too young. We can work on our own and support our younger siblings! We will not bother them!\u201d\u201cYes! Not only that, but I still have a ruthless wish. We have to make a clear statement today. From now on, we will take care of ourselves without elder uncle\u2019s help! Even if we have no food to eat and starve to death, we are willing to do!\u201dWhen Lian Fangzhou said, she did not forget to take a look at Mrs. Qiao, with a hint of helplessness and reluctance, and her tone of voice was just right.In fact, even if Lian Fangzhou did not look at Qiao, the elders and Zhang had looked Qiao\u2019s expression in her eyes when she listened that Lian Li\u2019s promise to take care of Lian Fangzhou and her siblings.At this time, they heard what Lian Fangzhou said and thought about the words that Qiao had said before that Lian Fangzhou did not let her pick up the vegetables in her garden, but she was planning something bad to send charcoals to her.In addition, they had previously faintly heard that they had pretended to help Lian Fangzhou harvest but moved almost all of the food into their own attic. Even she wanted the silvers got from Lian Fangzhou and Yang family\u2019s dismissal of the marriage!The elders and Zheng could not help but sigh, this person is too bad to serve! It is no wonder that Lian Fangzhou and Lian Ze are willing to be far away from her!In this case, if let the couple take care of both of them, they may be bullied more!\u201cFangzhou, Lian Ze! You don\u2019t believe me? How sad I am to heard this words!\u201d Lian Li was heartbroken.Lian Fangzhou and Lian Ze looked at each other. Lian Ze said: \u201cElder uncle, we are talking innermost thoughts and feelings! We have the ability to live on our own and we really don\u2019t need your help!\u201dLian Fangzhou said: \u201cThere is no other meaning to say this today. It is just for the elder uncle and the aunt! I will no longer talk about this thing in the future. It is unreasonable to say that you will not look after us. Uncle, you can rest assured, we will never affect the reputation of your family!\u201dWhen Lian Li wanted to say something more, Mrs. Qiao called out: \u201cThis is what you said! In the presence of so many people, you can\u2019t deny it!\u201d\u201cAbsolutely we will not deny!\u201d Lian Fangzhou and Lian Ze said quickly.Lian Fangzhou added another sentence: \u201cNo matter who wants to deny it, you can\u2019t! The old uncles of the village are watching!\u201d\u201cSince Fangzhou and Lian Ze said so, and Mrs. Lian Qiao agreed, then let\u2019s do it like this! Brother Lian Li, don\u2019t stick to it! I see that Fangzhou and Lian Ze are not too young to take care of themselves! Your wife said this, it\u2019s no use to be unpleasant for this! What do you think?\u201d Zhang said.The elders also nodded.Lian Li showed a bad expression, but when he thought about it, he nodded reluctantly and sighed: \u201cIf that is the case, then I will not say anything! Hey! These children, I am shameful!\u201dLian Li sighed, and he was heartbroken, but he only said that he was shameful. Think about it, he didn\u2019t really want to take care of Lian Fangzhou and her siblings. Instead, he saved the heart of being a cheaper man. Now that he can\u2019t take advantage of it, he certainly won\u2019t say anything generous. .\u201cElder uncle, you don\u2019t have to be like this!\u201d Lian Fangzhou was very polite and hesitated: \u201cVerbal statements are no guarantee. If someone takes this to ruin the reputation of the uncle and aunt, there is no real evidence.\u201d\u201cThen we sign a note! Put it down in black and white, and we are irrelevant from now on.

Only in this way can we benefit from each other!\u201dAt this time, Lian Li yelled at Mrs. Qiao for a second, and then sighed to Lian Fangzhou\u2019s brother and sister with a forced smile: \u201cEven you listen to him! In fact, it\u2019s really not necessary to be so clear! Now, how shameful for your uncle!\u201dWhat an ambiguous speech!Lian Fangzhou sneered in the mind, and Mrs. Qiao\u2019s man had fallen into her trap this time. From now on, it won\u2019t be easy for her to trick Qiao again. This uncle was really a hard nut to crack! As the saying went, someone wanted to gain an innocent reputation but also cherished the idea to satisfy his shameless lust at the same time. That was him!The bad guys were all played by others, but only he was a good one! Now he couldn\u2019t take care of his nephews and nieces anymore. See, how painful and helpless he was! Lian Fangzhou and her brother didn\u2019t understand him, which was really heartless!\u201cThe big uncle didn\u2019t do anything wrong. What should him be afraid of? As for us elder sister and little brother, we can\u2019t be clear in our hearts anymore that how can we blame our uncle? This word is still standing! Thus our aunt can be more assured!\u201dLian Fangzhou looked at Lian Li full of sincerity!To act? Let\u2019s played together!\u201cOh dear, look at you!\u201d\u201cUncle, we really won\u2019t misunderstand you! Really not!\u201dThey were continually making several disgusting compliments to each other. Then after exchanging their looks, Official Zhang and several old villagers finally reached an agreement: sign a note!Soon, the note was set up. Official Zhang read it out. Without any objections, the two sides pressed the fingerprints together. As witnesses, so did Official Zhang and the villagers.This note was in triplicate, each party held one copy, and the other one was reserved by Official Zhang. Here, this story came to an end.Mrs. Qiao stood up from the ground, and even snored heavily at Fangzhou and her brother with disgusting, as if she had lost a big bag.After a quick eye contact, Lian Fangzhou and Lian Ze were both speechless. They never thought of taking any advantage of the Qiao\u2019s. Let alone dislike. But looked at Mrs. Qiao\u2019s superior self-feeling.\u201cSince everything is okay, then we will go back first! It is sorry to bother Official Zhang and the village uncles for so long. We must make sincere apologies later!\u201d Lilian said with a smile.To apology, it was natural to entertain them with a meal and something as gifts.But if Lian Fangzhou and her younger brother didn\u2019t mention it, it was easy to let it go. After all, for people of the local village, to muddle through but never overdo was always the best.However, great Uncle Li was not satisfied.Last year, great Uncle Li had a serious illness and almost kicked the bucket! Actually, people of the old age were especially qualms about the word \u201cdeath\u201d. But just then Mrs. Qiao murmured \u201cOutlived rascal\u201d, which was right heard by him, so he felt a extraordinarily sense of tingling and anger.How could great Uncle Li easily let Mrs. Qiao go ?\u201d\u201cSo, is everything all right?\u201d great uncle Li snorted and cast a stern glance at Qiao: \u201cThis behavior can\u2019t be imitated. Without any punishment, people will followed the example. Otherwise, the reputation of Dafang Village will been ruined! Mrs. Qiao, since Fangzhou and her brother don\u2019t need you to take care of them, it\u2019s too cheap for you to have a day and night outside the temple! Well, I think you have to add a fine about ten taels of silver as a village public account. What do you all think?\u201d.Mrs. Qiao\u2019s face changed a lot. She enlarged his eyes and stared at great Uncle Li. She was about to say something but was choked off by the stare of Lian Li.\u201cI think so!\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s it! Lian Li, do you have anything to say?\u201dOf course, the villagers will not refuse this kind of thing.Lian Li\u2019s heart was full of bitter water. He certainly didn\u2019t want to, but what can he say at this time? I was afraid it was impossible for him to be willing or not!\u201cOK! OK! \u201d Lian Li smiled and nodded: \u201cI will definitely send the silver back\u2026\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d said Uncle Zhang, \u201cthat\u2019s good! You don\u2019t have to apology to us now! \u201dThe muscles at the corners of Lian Li\u2019s mouth twitched twice. He could only feel the bitterness and astringent. But even so, he had to clarify his position!Lian Li licked his lips and smiled: \u201cwhy not? It must be used. Ha ha! Apology is a must! \u201d\u201cHow kind of you!\u201d Uncle Zhang smiled reluctantly but not long.Lian Fangzhou and Lian Ze laughed in mind, almost complete hysteria. They all said that Uncle Zhang was smart and greedy. How could he be polite if Lian Li asked to sacrifice something?Lian Li deserved it! If not for his own fluke to say that, no one could force him.\u201cAll right! Everyone goes home! \u201d Official Zhang said after the nodding with several village elders.At this time, Hua Jintao suddenly laughed: 'since Fangzhou don\u2019t want the five taels of silver, aunt Qiao, how about just giving it to me! I\u2019ll go home with you to get it! Although the money is not that much, it\u2019s earned by my master through hard work. I can\u2019t spoil it at will! Isn\u2019t is?\u201dMrs. Qiao\u2019s anger made her forehead a sense of dizzy. She glared at Hua Jintao and snorted heavily, but didn\u2019t mention whether giving the money or not.From the beginning, this silver was earned from others. She couldn\u2019t say no!Seeing the village elders went away, Official Zhang glanced at Lian Li and Mrs. Qiao and said with a smile, \u201cCome on. You all go back home!\u201d Then he especially stared at Mrs. Qiao. His meaning didn\u2019t need to mention.\u201cBad girl! You must die! \u201d At the door of Offical Zheng\u2019s house, Mrs. Qiao took a heavy to the ground and glared at Lian Fangzhou and her brother.\u201cShut up! Stop! \u201d Lian Li reproached Mrs. Qiao, casting gloomy looks towards Lian Fangzhou and Lian Ze at the same time. Then he said lightly: \u201cYour eldest aunt gets such a bad temper. Don\u2019t take her serious!\u201dHonest speaking, no one could don\u2019t mind at all after being scolded directly. Even people like Lian Fangzhou and Lian Ze were stuck in their hearts: This was their good eldest aunt!\u201cUncle is worried too much. Our aunt is just frank! We won\u2019t mind!\u201d Lian Fangzhou smiled a little and said, \u201cI heard that my cousin is going to be a scholar next year so he will have a bright the future. At that time, I\u2019m afraid that when we want to talk with our frank aunt she would not stoop to associate with!\u201dLian Fangzhou said that, then she called Ah Jian and Lian Ze to leave.Lian Li\u2019s heart sank and he stared at Mrs. Qiao. He didn\u2019t say anything because Hua Jintao was there.Hua Jintao chuckled and said with his eyebrows raised, \u201cuncle Lian and aunt Qiao, let\u2019s go! Go to take the silver. I have to rush back to the city then!\u201dMrs. Qiao stared at Hua Jintao again. Thinking that Hua Jintao is now a rich in the city, she stifled the abuse, but with the secret thought of \u201cWait and see\u201d. She thought that when my son became a senior official in the future, I would be going to hang your ass!Hua Jintao took back his silver and went back.When she got into the carriage, her face sank at once. Then she bitted her lips for a while.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 - Money to Buy SeedsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 98 Money to Buy SeedsIn the middle of the last night, the man around Lian Fangzhou caught Hua Jintao and her master. He forced them to write a confession and guarantee with the pressed fingerprints. Today this man ordered her to come and follow his instructions.Being threatened by the knife on her neck, Hua Jintao had no choice.Hua Jintao never dreamed that an orphan girl, Lian Fangzhou, who had no money or support, was surrounded by such a powerful and unreasonable man. In this matter, Hua Jintao failed completely.Not only did she plant herself, but she also implicated her lord.Maybe, my lord had never be threatened by the knife on his neck through all his life. This time, I was afraid that the master wouldn\u2019t easily let me go!When I went back, I had to think about a good way to make my lord happy\u2026Hua Jintao regretted deeply now! She thought if she didn\u2019t seek to prevail over others and didn\u2019t take the initiative to share her worries with the master, everything would never happen!She had been very favored. As long as she continued to flatter the lord, everything would be fine. Why did she do that? This is the real loss of the bait along with the fish! What a big loss!When Lian Fangzhou, Lian Ze and A Jian returned to the home, their third aunt, Lian Che and Lian Fangqing met them.\u201cHow are you? Is it all right? \u201d Third aunt asked.Two little kids rushed up and called \u201cSister\u201dFilled with great warms, Lian Fangzhou embraced Lian Che and Lian Fangqing with light pats. Then she nodded and smiled: \u201cIt\u2019s all right! It\u2019s all right!\u201d\u201cGlad to hear that!\u201d Third aunt really relieved when she saw A Jane nodded. Aunt said with a smile, \u201ccome in and have the meal! It\u2019s done and is hot in the kitchen. We are just waiting for you!\u201d\u201cGreat! I\u2019m a little hungry indeed! \u201d Lian Fangzhou smiled and everyone entered into the house.Not for a while, after the meal, A Jian said: \u201cYou\u2019re tired after a night\u2019s tossing. Go back to the room and have a rest! It\u2019s not too late to do anything else tomorrow! A Ze, you go to have a rest too! \u201dLian Fangzhou was really tired, so she nodded with a smile: \u201cDon\u2019t just worry about us, you didn\u2019t have a good night either. Fortunately, you were there last night. Otherwise, I really didn\u2019t know\u2026 Anyway, thank you this time!\u201dLian Fangzhou and A Jian didn\u2019t elaborate on the specific story. They only said that the third aunt and other people knew that Lian Fangzhou had been knocked unconscious by Mrs. Qiao\u2019s design and was sold. Lian Ze knew more, but still not complete.A Jian said with a smile: \u201cI don\u2019t know how many times this \u2018thank you\u2019 you\u2019ve said. Since I live here, I am responsible for what I can do. So don\u2019t be too polite!\u201d\u201cElder sister,\u201d said Lian Ze dumbly, \u201cI must try my best to practice martial arts. Then in the future, I can protect you!\u201dLast night, Lian Ze was deeply shocked by the incident. If without big brother A Jian, he would not even be able to make his aunt tell the truth, let alone saved people!For the first time, he hated himself so deeply for his powerlessness! In the end, he was not strong enough.\u201cA Jian told me that you have done a good job.\u201d Lian Fangzhou chuckled: \u201cwhen you grow up, I will be relieved!\u201dJane also comforted him and said, \u201cyou\u2019ve do your best! As long as you keep it in mind, you will become strong one day!\u201dLian Ze nodded \u201chmm\u201d with great aspiration.After dinner, Lian Fangzhou had to go to Chief Zhang\u2019s home to pay the money for cotton seeds. By the way, she would bring the potato seeds back.But when she said she was going out, the three brothers and sisters like Lian Ze came together and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go with you!\u201dLooking at these three pairs of big eyes, Lian Fangzhou smiled automatically. She knew they were worried about her.\u201cYou two are at home, elder sister. Let me accompany you! I will be with you everytime when you go out in the evening!\u201d Lian Ze said. And then he told the two little ones, \u201cYou two are not allowed to go out in the evening!\u201dLian Fangqing and Lian Che said \u201cOh\u201d. Then they didn\u2019t insist on going out.Lian Fangzhou knew that Lian Ze was very upset about his inability to save her. Asking him to do something for her may make him feel better. So she nodded and laughed: \u201cOK! I don\u2019t know how much potato seeds we would be shared with! You have great strength. You are right for help! \u201dAfter hearing this, Lian Ze was really in a good mood and nodded: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, elder sister. I\u2019ll take care of it!\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t go, you two come back as soon as possible!\u201d A Jian also understood and agreed with Lian Fangzhou\u2019s intention.Lian Fangzhou smiled and agreed to go with Lian Ze.This time, I took a heavy cloth bag filled with copper plates.The money was paid to the villagers who offered seeds. All the seeds were still kept in the chief\u2019s house for the time being. Others needed to buy them back at the government\u2019s price in a few days.Seeing they two brother and sister, Chief Zhang came over with a smile, \u201cYou\u2019re just coming. I\u2019m still wondering if I need to take notice of you about the seeds.\u201dTook notice of? It was naturally to ask whether she wanted this cotton seed or not! Just now such a big thing happened. Chief Zhang, the careful man at all the time, always thought it was necessary to notify. But who knew that Lian Fangzhou came by herself, which made Chief Zhang unconsciously thought higher of her\u2013 this girl was very considerate! Moreover, she was so tough and tensile that nothing could rock her mind.Lian Fangzhou said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m thinking of coming here to make you know! As usual, here are 1300 copper plates. Please take them. I\u2019ll exchange them in the city tomorrow and send some to you again tomorrow evening! Please count up now. I don\u2019t know if I make any mistake. \u201dZhang Lizheng nodded and said with a smile, \u201cOK, let\u2019s do the work. Wait a moment, let me count them up!\u201d After that, he counted them in front of Lian Fangzhou and her brother.Of course, the money was of the right number. After this, both of them made sure that there was no mistake. Chief Zhang said that the news would be released in the morning tomorrow. Lian Fangzhou thanked him. And by the way she weighted the share of potato seeds 40 kilos, which was about 80 cents.After paying off, they two went back with potatoes.Looking at the bulging money bag in Chief Zhang\u2019s hand, Mrs. Niu couldn\u2019t help being greedy. Although she knew clearly that it was the money that Lian Fangzhou gave her husband to pay for the seeds to the villagers, she still wanted it. And once the money came to her own hands, if let it go again, she felt a sense of sadness for no reason.Mrs. Niu moved her mouth showing although distressed, she was not blinded by money.Mrs. Niu smiled,\u201d We should sell the cotton seedlings. If you want to try planting it, you can just leave some. We have thousands kilograms of it, it doesn\u2019t matter to leave some.\u201cNonsense.\u201d Chief Zhang said seriously: \u201cYou just change your nature of greedy. I must warn you that if something bad happens in the future, don\u2019t blame me for not protecting you!\u201dToday, thanks for Mrs. Qiao\u2019s words that gave him a right call. Today, there was only Mrs. Qiao having such a terrible idea, but who knew whether there would be Mrs. Zhang or Li tomorrow? Fortunately, this time, Lian Fangzhou\u2019s under state it and let this go. If it was something else, I was afraid it was not so easy to explain!Some things were tacit. And as long as we didn\u2019t say it, everything would be fine. But once the window paper is pierced, everything would be disclosed in another way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 - Land Purchase Pt.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 99 Land Purchase Pt.1Lian Fangzhou and Lian Ze took home a big sack of potatoes. Several people like Third Grandma came to see this rare thing.Third Grandma said: \u201cHaving been planted all my life, I never heard that soybeans could grow in the soil! I have to take a good look at \u201cSoil Bean\u201d (In Chinese, this is the pronunciation of potato) ! \u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it either! I want to see it too! \u201d Lian Fangqing and Lian Che looked with big eyes.Opening the sack, Lian Fangqing and Lian Che scrambled to take one out. That was bigger than an egg. Both of them were surprised and said \u201cAh\u201d and something rare words with a smile.Third Grandma was also surprised and called out, \u201cIs this the \u201cSoil Bean?\u201d How big! Oh, it\u2019s still with mud! \u201dLian Fangzhou laughed and thought in her mind\u2013it was still small, which must be limited by the seeds and planting techniques. In modern times, it was not rare to have potatoes as big as adults\u2019 fists!\u201cI don\u2019t think it looks like soybeans at all!\u201d Lian Che looked at it carefully.\u201cI just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s delicious or not!\u201d Lian Fang said in a clear voice.Third Grandma looked at her with a smile and said, \u201cI\u2019m thinking too!\u201dLian Fangzhou then replied with a smile: \u201cI\u2019ll plant it next year, and I ensure you can have \u201cSoil Soybeans\u201d as many as possible! But we can\u2019t taste it now, since it was for seed! Being discovered if eating secretly, we will be punished! \u201dLian Fangqing understood the importance of seeds and nodded.\u201cI just don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s good seed to survive or not, alas!\u201d Third Grandma sighed.Lian Fangzhou then said with a smile, \u201cWhatever kind the seed is. Well, let\u2019s just plant like soybeans!\u201dIt\u2019s too unreliable for the government to do. It\u2019s over just sending the seeds out. There\u2019s not even a simple guide, such as when to plant, what kind of land is suitable, how to irrigate, when to harvest, etc.\u201cThat\u2019s right! No matter how the name has a bean character, it must be right to plant like soybean!\u201d Third Grandma smiled: \u201cClever Fangzhou.\u201dPeople were talking with joy. On such occasions, A Jian always sat quietly and said nothing. And Lian Ze just laughed aside.After saying that for a while, Lian Fangzhou carefully tied the sack, clapped her hands and said with a smile, \u201cwell, we\u2019ve seen it. Let\u2019s go to sleep! These seeds must be put in the attic tomorrow! Third Grandma, I will go to the city with Ah Jian and Ah Ze (Capital A with a name is as an adorable nickname) tomorrow morning. I may be very busy these days. You are going to take care of everything at home! \u201dThird Grandma agreed with a smile, and everyone went to sleep.After breakfast the next day, Lian Fangzhou, Lian Ze and Ah Jin went to the county.Ah Jian said: \u201cIf the money is enough, what about buying a donkey and a donkey cart. I\u2019m afraid there will be more time to use them in the future. Walking alone will not only make us tired, but also delay our work!\u201dLian Fangzhou thought about it. She wanted to buy not only a donkey, but also cattle. There were many farm tools she also wanted to purchase or update. So she had to make a plan later!But the most important was to buy land first! Buy the land first, and the others will be added according to the number of fields.\u201cI think so, too! When we choose a good land, let\u2019s go to the animal market and ask about the price these days! If the price is all right, you can buy livestock. The price in winter can be cheaper than that in spring! But we have to take good care of them until the winter passes by!\u201d Lian Fangzhou laughed.Lian Ze was very happy and said: \u201cSister, we are going to buy the donkey and donkey cart in our family too, right? I can\u2019t even think about it! Elder sister, don\u2019t worry. Che\u2019er (\u201cer\u201d with a name is also as an adorable nickname. Here refers to Lian Che) and I will take good care of the donkey! \u201d\u201cOh, will it delay your martial practice?\u201d Lian Fangzhou picked a eyebrow and joked. All of they three broke into laughter.Lian Ze got up to practice martial arts before dawn today. He said that he would do so everyday. He worked really harder. In the future, he would protect his sister, his family.\u201cSister!\u201d Lian Ze scratched his head. He was very embarrassed and said seriously: \u201cNo! I also have to do what I can for my family. They are too young. I can\u2019t let my elder sister busy on her own! \u201d\u201cWhat a great brother of my!\u201d Lian Fangzhou said with satisfaction.When they three entered the city, they went to the bank to exchange one thousand tales of silver for seven one hundred silver draft (a form of paper money). The left three hundred tales of silver for small changes like fifty and ten. Besides, they kept ten tales of silver for pocket money.Dafang Village was not far from the county, so they went directly to the city to find the land manager in charge of land sales. If they are far away from the county, they go to the nearest town to do such things.They inquired about the location of Liu Jia, who was in charge of the land sales in the surrounding areas. They also bought two boxes of snacks as a present.Liu Jia was right at home. When he saw three strangers coming, he knew business must come. He smiled politely and said, \u201cHow to call you guys? Is it for land? Ha ha, come in and have a seat!\u201dLiu Jia spoke to Ah Jian closely. Since only A Jian is an adult of the three he naturally regarded Ah Jian as the one who made decisions.Ah Jian nodded and said, \u201cWe want to see the land over a mountain. I wonder if there is any land suitable?\u201dLian Fangzhou added: \u201cwe are from Dafang Village. Can you find any land for selling in Dafang Village or nearby villages?\u201dLiu Jia happened to have several paddy fields to sell. When he heard that they asked about the worthless dry land, his heart went down a lot. However, mosquito legs also counted as meat. That says selling dry land also counts money. Let alone this was his job. The smile on his face was still there. He asked, \u201cI\u2019ll take a look at the record book. So how much land do you want to buy?\u201dWhile talking, he went to the inner room to get the special record book.\u201cHow much?\u201d Liu Jia widened his eyes and asked Lian Fangzhou.Hearing their answer, he came out of the inner room at once.\u201cTwo thousand acres. Do you have any land for free now? If not, can you help me solve this problem? \u201d Lian Fangzhou smiled. Every of her word fell into Liu Jia\u2019s ear so clear.Liu Jia stunned for a while, but also cast his eyes to the Ah Jian for the exact answer.\u201cYou can discuss the details with Miss Lian!\u201d A Jian smiled. He didn\u2019t know much about these things.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Liu Jia moved his lips, clapped his head and sat down, laughing, \u201cI\u2019ve been working for half my life, but I\u2019m really lost! You need so many places. Now I really don\u2019t know whether there is any record of so much land.Liu Jia looked at the book carefully and brighten his eyes not long. He said with a smile, \u201cHere will be a suitable place!\u201dThen he beckoned Lian Fangzhou they three to look at it carefully. He pointed it out, and said, \u201cMr. Wang, the moneybags of your Dafang Village, thinks these dry lands are unproductive and laborious. He is about to sell them just right, a total of one hundred and sixty acres. Not far from this place is the places of Landlord Yang from Yang Village, about three hundred and eighty acres. His son needs a lot of money to do business in a hurry. His family sells a lot of land. This is one of their place! There is a large area in the middle, about 280 acres of which belongs to four families. If you want to a large continuous area, you can talk with this four families about it. Buy it or change it. Anyway, whatever you want. Sure, that would spend more money. The remaining large continuous area of more than 600 acres is wasteland without owner. If you want to buy it, you have to pay the reclamation fee to the village first, and then pay a sum of land sale money according to the official price to the government. You have to spend more money\u2026 Of course, there are also preferential policies for this wasteland. That is there is no tax for the first three years. All together, the wasteland covers more than 1500 acres! \u201cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - LAND PURCHASE (PART 2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCHAPTER 100 LAND PURCHASE (PART 2)Lian Fangzhou smiled and asked: \u201cI don\u2019t know how much the wasteland will cost. Firstly, how much is the land sold and paid at the government price? And how much will the owner want to sell?\u201dLiu Jia smiled and said: \u201cMiss Lian is really smart. When put forward, every question is on the key point! Wasteland reclamation fee is a penny per acre. At the government price, the cost of land is two tales of silver per acre. For the owner, Moneybag Wang, three tales of silver per acre. Landlord Yang is at the same price too. You can still bargain for the price, but it will not be lower than two tales of the acres! Other four people who own the land, I am afraid it will be more!\u201dSquinting his eyes aside, Lian Ze was secretly moving his tongue. He couldn\u2019t even count how much money they had to spend, but he was certain enough it would cost a lot!Lian Fangzhou lowered his head slightly, and was calculating quickly in her mind. It was estimated to cost around 3,500 tales of silver.Observing every mood of Miss Lian, Liu Jia thought she must thought it was too expensive. She smiled and said: \u201cThe government has always encouraged the wasteland reclamation. If you buy six or seven hundred acres at a time, the price can definitely be lower! At least one hundred or two can be saved. Of course, if you don\u2019t want to, you can buy it piecemeal! You just take your own ideas!\u201dLian Fangzhou glanced at Ah Jian and smiled at Liu Jia: \u201cThen, just talk about these here we still don\u2019t know what it is in reality. So can we go and have a look?\u201d\u201cThis is natural! If you really want it, I will lead you to see! Oh, I\u2019m not dare to lie about such a big event. The land is clearly there. It can be seen at a glance!\u201d Liu Jia said straightforward.So it was.Lian Fangzhou then laughed: \u201cOf course, we really want to buy it! If it\u2019s right, we can settle it today!\u201d\u201cOK, let\u2019s go now! What a straightforward girl!\u201d Liu Jia clapped his thigh and said with pleasure.Liu Jia drived a donkey cart, with Lian Fangzhou they three, and soon arrived at the places.It was about two miles away from the main road. But it was just right in that if it was on the side of the road, it would be difficult to take care. At that time, we could roughly build a road that could rightly pass through the donkey cart, which was convenient for the future transportation.Generally speaking, the terrain of this large area was flat, with occasional undulating hills. The only unsatisfied was that in the west of the middle lay a mountain package, which was about 50 or 60 acres by visual inspection.Liu Jia explained to them one by one and took them for a walk. Lian Fangzhou asked from time to time that she was more and more satisfied. Those land which had a owner were naturally appropriate. Even those hundreds of acres of wasteland, they could have someone clear it up in time before the end of this year. Thus, by the spring of next year, she would not delay planting.There were two water sources in the field, which could be well cleaned up and trimmed into standard channels. So irrigation was not a problem.Liu Jia had held back a trick or two in mind. We needed to know that the income of the land manager was earned from gap price between the buyer and the seller according to the total price of the land. The larger the amount of the transaction, the more money he may earn!If this business was done, he would have at least fifty-six tales of silver. Just as the new year was approaching, how could he not spare no effort to make it to speed a good Spring Festival?But Lian Fangzhou asked every question on the key point, and carefully looked at the soil under his feet. She seemed to be an expert of this business. He was awestruck in the heart. How dare he to exaggerate the price? He could only try his best to impress they with sincerity!He had been paying close attention to Lian Fangzhou\u2019s look. Sure enough her satisfied look couldn\u2019t slink away from him. Liu Jia then said with a smile: \u201cMiss Lian, do you want to go up that mountain and have a look? If you buy all this wasteland, that mountain will be free!\u201dLian Fangzhou was moved, and he said with a smile, \u201cOK, let\u2019s go up and have a look!\u201d\u201cWell, please, Miss!\u201d Liu Jia raised her hand.There was no road on the mountain. Only to be found many weeds and shrubs blocking the road. They were all panting when they reach the top of the mountain.Glanced at the mountain, Lian Ze turned his mouth and said in mind: \u201cNo wonder he gave us for free! The land on the mountain is so thin that it can\u2019t grow anything at all. There are many big rocks in the West. Who would afford to buy them for nothing!\u201dAt the top of the mountain, the view was very wide, since the mountain raised abruptly. Standing on the top of the mountain, you could have a panoramic view of the surrounding area overall.In this place with good view, Liu Jia had to take the opportunity to point out and explain other places to Lian Fangzhou.In fact, he didn\u2019t need to say that. Lian Fangzhou was already secretly full of satisfaction. This mountain couldn\u2019t be good anymore!Although we couldn\u2019t plant anything else on the mountain, we could plant all kinds of fruit trees! Every kind of tree planted here, it would be enough for a large family to eat.Fenced the bottom of the mountain; pull up the barbed wire, you could also raise chickens. Selling chickens and eggs next year was also a good income.What\u2019s more, several simple houses could be built on the top of the mountain. After the cotton entered the maturity period, the cotton field must be guarded by someone. If there were several rooms here, it would also be convenient for management.Besides, all kinds of tools could also be put here!Lian Fangzhou was really satisfied with this large area! It could even be called perfect.\u201cUncle Liu, it\u2019s really a good place to stand here.\u201d When Liu Jia asked again, Lian Fangzhou finally said with a smile, \u201cUncle Liu is a straightforward man. If I don\u2019t give you a clear answer, it\u2019s not unacceptable! As long as Uncle Liu can talk the land with owners well fro me, I\u2019ll buy all this land! \u201c\u201cOK! What\u2019s the maximum price you can accept? \u201d Liu Jia was very happy and asked.\u201cWell,\u201d Lian Fangzhou looked at Liu Jia and said with a smile, \u201cIt depends on Uncle Liu\u2019s good speech! As for me, of course, the more reasonable the better! \u201cLiu Jia wanted to find out her real ides. Of course she wouldn\u2019t say. But she was not unreasonable to refuse his question. See she only demanded \u201creasonable\u201d rather than \u201cthe lower the better\u201d. It was believed that Liu Jia understood her meaning.As expected, Liu Jia knew what she said, nodded and smiled, \u201cOK! Don\u2019t worry, Miss. I\u2019ll try my best to make a deal and ask for a good price. \u201c\u201cThank you so much, Uncle Liu!\u201d Lian Fangzhou said with a smile, \u201cBut I have another request. Can Uncle Liu not say that the buyer is me first?\u201dThis was not a difficult thing. In fact, many buyers he met before also made this request, so he nodded and smiled: \u201cThis is OK!\u201dLian Fangzhou looked to the west, and the sun was setting towards the sky. So she said with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s not early now, let\u2019s come to an end today! And where is the last place? It will bother Uncle Liu taking us to have a look tomorrow! By the way, we have talked about this place today. But how much is the deposit? \u201cLiu Jia thought for a moment and then smiled: \u201cIn principle, it\u2019s not reasonable to accept your deposit. But if you has given the deposit first when someone asks about these places again, I have my good excuse. Well, one hundred tales of silver is enough.
