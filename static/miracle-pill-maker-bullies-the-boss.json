She was slowly riding past the small shop by the street corner when the sweet, old lady shouted to her.2Huo Yao gently pressed the brakes and put her feet on the ground to bring the bike to a complete stop. She expertly took off her helmet. Each of her movements was fluid. Her long ponytail cascaded down her shoulder instantly, enhancing her beauty. She was born with delicate and beautiful facial features, to begin with, and at the moment, her posture added a mighty, heroic bearing to her.9The old lady stared at Huo Yao, exclaiming to herself that pretty kids did have natural advantages. Even during an act as simple as riding a bike, Huo Yao looked out of the ordinary.4\u201cUmm, I think you have got some guests at home. The person came in a very, very impressive limousine. My son told me that the limousine is worth millions. No car in our county can compare to that car\u2026\u201d As the old lady moved forward with her story, she made some exaggerated gestures.Huo Yao listened to her words, making her immerse deep in thought. But she showed no expression on her face that would indicate anything unusual.Since Huo Yao was not responding, the old lady took a careful look around and then stepped closer to Huo Yao to whisper to her. \u201cYaoyao, tell me. Since when does your family know these rich people? Or\u2026 are you in any sort of trouble?\u201dThe old lady remembered that someone drove a car to her house last year and a big fight had broken out.Huo Yao\u2019s eyelids were twitching now. The old lady\u2019s thoughts were wandering in the wrong direction, which Huo Yan found both amusing and annoying.To avoid any more misunderstanding, Huo Yao replied in a gentle voice. \u201cProbably a distant relative has come to visit.\u201dAs soon as she gave this answer, the old lady became suspicious. But before she could inquire any further, Huo Yao had already put her helmet back on and waved her a quick goodbye. \u201cGrandma Huang, time for me to go now.\u201dThe old lady watched as Huo Yao rode away. A long while later, she mumbled to herself. \u201cIsn\u2019t your family famous for being a household in hardship?\u201dWhat distant relative?4Not to mention someone so rich.4***Huo Yao rode home quickly. Even from a distance away, she could see that \u2018very, very impressive\u2019 black sedan parked in the alley outside the yard.The logo of the sedan was a soaring eagle. The car had a solemn yet classy look to it.This was a Bentley. No wonder the car would cost millions.Huo Yao\u2019s lips stretched into a sarcastic grin. There were enough thoughts on her mind but she hid them well. She got off from her bike slowly and then clicked some buttons on the bike as she had done innumerable times earlier.In a blink, the bike folded up automatically and now was suddenly smaller than an 11-inch laptop.36The gate to the yard was wide open. Huo Yao picked up her bike effortlessly, and stepped into the yard. Before she got to the living room, she could already hear someone\u2019s shrill, harsh voice.\u201cMom, why are you being so stubborn? What is so special about this shabby place that you cannot bear to leave it behind?\u201d\u201cI have already told you that I bought you a big house downtown and I hired a nanny solely to look after you. No matter how you think about it, that life will be much better than the one you are living currently.\u201d\u201cTake a look at this dirty floor, the wall\u2019s color is fading and water still leaks upstairs during rains, right?\u201d\u201cYou are in poor health. Why do you have to stay in this worn-out, moldy, old house? People would think that we are poor and that we are abusing our elders\u2026\u201dHuo Yao was still standing in the yard. Upon hearing these words, she sunk into deep thoughts. But soon, she raised her head back up.2Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a two storey place with a yard in the front. It was fitted with red bricks on the wall, and black tiles on the roof. No varnish or ceramic tiles had ever been applied on the walls. Mold and yellow stains had climbed to some parts of the walls due to lack of repairs.1In a nutshell, this house still retained the standard style of the 1980s. Indeed, the house was old and ragged.Huo Yao tapped her nose. She had been living in this harsh environment for a year. Suddenly, the realisation hit her that she sure could adapt herself to difficult circumstances!1At this moment, the shrill voice came to a sudden stop.He Xiaoman, who was wearing a black lace dress, walked out of the room. She had a purple scarf around her neck and was sporting delicate makeup. Her hair was combed into a bun with a diamond hairpin on it. Everything about her screamed wealth. She was taken aback seeing Huo Yao standing in the yard.But He Xiaoman recovered quickly and came back to her senses. The complicated expressions faded away from the depth of her eyes. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d She questioned in a cold voice.Huo Yao stared at He Xiaoman quietly and calmly. But her mind had wandered to a different place already.A year ago, for some unknown reason, she had taken over this body. Back then, the host\u2019s name was not Huo Yao, but Lu Yao, and she had been the darling daughter of a nouveau riche family of City S.However, several months ago, she was informed abruptly that this body, this person, was not a part of the Lu Family. When the original host of this body had been born, the nurse at the hospital had ended up swapping two infants due to some confusion.As a matter of fact, the biological parents of this person were a normal, working-class couple. They had no money, nor any power. It was said that the couple had to raise four sons who were worthless. It was sufficient to say that that household was under tremendous pressure already.3This person\u2019s foster mother, aka, He Xiaoman, got to know that her actual biological daughter was living in a poor family while she had been raising this girl who should have been in that impoverished situation. This sharp contrast aroused a surge of maternal love inside He Xiaoman.Despite living in a poor family, He Xiaoman\u2019s biological daughter appeared to be gentle and refined with a sweet mouth and a good heart. He Xiaoman didn\u2019t waste much time and picked up her biological daughter from those horrid surroundings to take her back to where she originally belonged. He Xiaoman changed her biological daughter\u2019s name and added her name to the family tree, just so that nothing unfair would happen to her daughter ever again.As for the fake daughter who had been known as Lu Yao till now, despite being born in a wealthy household, she was never liked by the Lu Family. Since she was a kid, she had lived with He Xiaoman\u2019s mother in a small county. He Xiaoman would only visit her sporadically, once every couple of years.Since the genuine daughter returned to the family, the fake daughter had to move out. Before Huo Yao\u2019s biological parents came to pick her up, He Xiaoman told her that she did not deserve the Lu surname, and could not continue to live here.At that time, He Xiaoman had been so full of herself while trying to get rid of Huo Yao. Nothing had changed since. She continued to remain arrogant even now.Huo Yao pulled her mind back to the present and looked away from He Xiaoman, as if not impressed with what was in front of her.He Xiaoman frowned and grew furious. \u201cWhat is with the attitude?\u201dHer question conveyed her wrath to its full extent which was a source of amusement for Huo Yao. She raised her eyebrows and answered with a question of her own. \u201cThen, who do you think you are to come here?\u201dAs the sound of Huo Yao\u2019s amused voice, He Xiaoman\u2019s well-maintained face became twisted.Indeed, Huo Yao was not Lu Family\u2019s child. Though she was raised by the Lu Family for a long period of time, she still remained unrestrained, uncultivated, and impolite.At this moment, He Xiaoman could not help but think of her biological daughter, Lu Xia. While Lu Xia grew up in a humble, average family, she was the epitome of innocence and elegance. She did well in school and was naturally gifted. She was discovered by a talent scout and had become a star already. She was born to bring fame to the Lu Family.As for Huo Yao, apart from her face, she was worse than Lu Xia in every way possible.He Xiaoman took a deep breath and reminded herself of her intention to come here. She pushed back the anger and took a few seconds to calm herself down.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I hope you can accomplish this task.\u201d He Xiaoman\u2019s condescending attitude had been restored with these sarcastic words to Huo Yao.Though she had used the word \u2018hope\u2019, her attitude clearly showed that she thought the opposite.Huo Yao curled her lips. Before she could respond though, Yang Qiuhua, He Xiaoman\u2019s mother and the person who had raised Huo Yao, came out of the room.1Yang Qiuhua slapped gently on He Xiaoman\u2019s arm, giving her a sign that she had spoken enough. Then, Yang Qiuhua shifted her eyes towards Huo Yao. As she did so, the look in her eyes softened automatically. \u201cYaoyao, you are back. How did the match go?\u201dHuo Yao replied with a shrug. \u201cIt was okay.\u201d\u201cDid you win?\u201d Yang Qiuhua sounded excited.\u201cYes, I came first.\u201d Huo Yao still sounded nonchalant. She did not seem to be proud of her achievement as if pulling this off was a child\u2019s play for her.Yang Qiuhua wiped away the happy tears which had trickled down her cheeks. \u201cCongratulations, my dear girl.\u201d1Standing next to them, He Xiaoman frowned in confusion. She asked the old lady with a scowl. \u201cWhat first place? What match?\u201dYang Qiuhua moved her gaze to He Xiaoman, with a proud smile lingering on her face. She said with delight in her voice, \u201cYou may not know this. But Yaoyao is not only doing well in school, but she is also\u2026\u201dHe Xiaoman lost her interest before even hearing the complete reply. The old lady had not answered her question. Instead, she began to speak in favor of Huo Yao which was surely going to be an exaggeration.Impatiently, He Xiaoman waved her hand and interrupted her mother rudely. \u201cFine, I know. You don\u2019t have to present her as a good kid in front of me. Do you remember her past grades? She couldn\u2019t even manage to get admission in the prominent high school of our county. She should be thankful that our Lu Family gave her enough money to enroll herself. Or else, she would have had to attend a technical high school.\u201dHe Xiaoman paused for a moment and then threw a sarcastic look towards Huo Yao. \u201cA fish\u2019s eye can never become a pearl.\u201dInstinctively, Yang Qiuhua looked at Huo Yao, fearing that the latter would find these words hurtful. \u201cYou have never cared about her during all these years. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t even know that Yaoyao has become\u2026\u201d Yang Qiuhua hurriedly started to explain.He Xiaoman sneered with contempt visible in her eyes and cut off Yang Qiuhua mid-sentence, once again.With impatience in her voice, she said, \u201cMom, she is not my biological daughter, nor is she your real granddaughter. She is a Huo Family kid. Whether she does well in school or not, it has nothing to do with me. I don\u2019t want to know about it.\u201dYang Qiuhua\u2019s smile froze on her face. The unfinished words remained stuck in her throat. A long moment later, she spoke in a subdued and depressed voice, \u201cYaoyao is my granddaughter!\u201dHe Xiaoman rubbed her forehead in impatience. What kind of honeyed words did Huo Yao feed her mother? Why would her mom dislike her biological granddaughter and continue to be affectionate to this ill-bred and fake granddaughter?2\u201cShe enjoyed so many advantages in the Lu Family for seventeen years while my biological daughter suffered so much hardship. Mom, wake up. Don\u2019t regard her as your family anymore!\u201d\u201cYou are currently treating her as your family. But who knows? She may just be just taking advantage of you. Maybe she is trying to scam us of our money to give to her biological parents\u2026\u201d1\u201cStop it!\u201d Yang Qiuhua was quaking with rage now. \u201cI raised Yaoyao myself. I know her better than you do. Don\u2019t speculate about her character with your biased heart.\u201dHe Xiaoman\u2019s face became clouded. \u201cYou cannot even tell right from wrong, Mom. I think that you have become muddle-headed because of old age. You need to see a doctor!\u201d1Yang Qiuhua was in her sixties and her heart was weak. Angered by He Xiaoman\u2019s words, she turned ghastly pale as she banged her fists against her chest.Huo Yao put down her stuff on the ground and hurried towards the old lady. She helped Yang Qiuhua sit on a bamboo chair and put her right hand on Yang Qiuhua\u2019s wrist.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A few seconds later, she let go of her grandmother\u2019s wrist. \u201cIs your chest pain acting up again?\u201d Her voice was hoarse with concern.Yang Qiuhua forced a smile out of her pale lips. She took Huo Yao\u2019s hands and shook her head. Then she spoke in a calming tone, \u201cI am okay. It\u2019s just an old illness which likes to act up. Don\u2019t worry so much.\u201dHe Xiaoman was frightened by the sudden change of events. As soon as she pulled herself together, she pushed Huo Yao\u2019s hand away and shouted. \u201cMom, are you okay? How are you feeling? Should we get you to the hospital?\u201dHuo Yao frowned when her hand was pushed away. She looked at He Xiaoman for a second and then went back inside after shaking her head.He Xiaoman took out her phone to call the ambulance. At the same time, she did not forget to snort, taking a dig at Huo Yao. \u201cMom, did you see that? That is the person that you raised. How can she go back inside as if nothing had happened. You are clearly unwell\u2026\u201d1He Xiaoman shook her head in disgust and began to dial the number.Soon, Huo Yao came back with a cup in her hand.He Xiaoman got off her phone, and turned around, only to see Huo Yao feeding something to her mother. He Xiaoman took the cup hurriedly from her and found that it was not purified water. She bellowed angrily at once.\u201cWhat is this that you are giving my mom?\u201dHuo Yao\u2019s eyes were focussed on the cup that had been taken away from her hand. A chilly look arose in her eyes. Suddenly, her delicate face became expressionless and there was a dangerous aura coming off her body.He Xiaoman had never seen Huo Yao like this. This unfamiliar feeling scared her. Unknowingly, she took a step backwards. \u201cWhat\u2026 what are you trying to do?\u201dHer tone was evidently less harsh than before.\u201cXiaoman, given me that cup. Yaoyao has got this medicine for me.\u201d Yang Qiuhua had finally got the chance to catch her breath. While saying so, she reached out her hand to retrieve the cup from her daughter\u2019s hand.Upon hearing those words, He Xiaoman\u2019s eyes opened wide. Instead of giving it back, she poured the remaining medicine on the ground. \u201cShe bought it for you? What kind of medicine can she, a country bumpkin, get for you? This is insane.\u201dLooking at the wasted medicine, Yang Qiuhua grimaced and tried to explain. \u201cYaoyao\u2019s medicine\u2026\u201dBut in her usual fashion, He Xiaoman left no chance for her to finish her words. \u201cStop it. Can you just stop it? The ambulance is getting here soon. Let\u2019s get you a full physical check-up while we are there. How can you take just any medicine? What if you have an adverse reaction to it?\u201d1He Xiaoman shook her head and then glared at Huo Yao. \u201cYou, listen up. You gave my mom some random medicine. If something goes wrong, the entire Huo Family\u2019s death will not be able to make up for it. Hurry up and leave from here. Do not stay here any longer. I will give you this chance on account of the fact that you used to be a part of my family once. \u201d1\u201cXiaoman, that is enough!\u201d Yang Qiuhua was fully consumed with anxiety and anger. \u201cYaoyao, this is your family and your house. Don\u2019t listen to her. Don\u2019t leave\u2026\u201dHuo Yao looked at the ground. Just now, Yang Qiuhua had finished over half of her medicine. Such being the case, Huo Yao was not in the mood to waste any more time on her \u2018once upon a time\u2019 mother.She turned around and crouched down in front of Yang Qiuhua slowly. She looked at her with a calm expression and said, \u201cYou know what? You deserve to live a better life now.\u201dYang Qiuhua was stunned into stillness. Her heart went into panic and her pale lips trembled before she could ask the question in a hoarse voice. \u201cYaoyao, did you hear what we discussed inside?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a rare occurence on her otherwise clouded face. She gently stroked her grandma\u2019s white hair and lowered her voice as if she were calming a kid.\u201cThe documents which I need to get a transfer to another school have come through. It is time for me to leave. Take care of yourself and remember to take your medicine on time. I will come and visit you when I am back in City S. Okay?\u201dHer tender touch moved Yang Qiuhua, rendering her speechless. After a moment, Yang Qiuhua grabbed Huo Yao\u2019s hands and said, \u201cAlright. I will do whatever you say.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d Huo Yao nodded happily.He Xiaoman, on the other hand, was not pleased to see this. Her mouth was dry and her tongue was scorched from talking to her mom but still, she had failed to persuade her to come back to the city with her. How come this wild kid could talk sense into her mother with such few words?I really have underestimated how good this wild girl is, at lying and conning people!Right then, the ambulance arrived.Under He Xiaoman\u2019s instructions, Yang Qiuhua was carried to the ambulance by the paramedics. Before they left for the hospital, He Xiaoman remembered to warn Huo Yao again against staying here any longer.After He Xiaoman took off, Huo Yao went upstairs to her bedroom and dragged out her pre-packed suitcase from under the bed.Even if He Xiaoman had not come here to make a scene, Huo Yao was already preparing to leave.During the past few months since she changed to Huo Yao from Lu Yao, she had not gone back to the Huo Family. For one thing, she was worried about Yang Qiuhua. For another, she was in the second semester of her sophomore year in high school. She had reached an agreement with her biological parents that she would take a transfer after the semester to finish her senior year there.Huo Yao took out a letter from the drawer of an aged desk. She stroked the corner of that piece of paper and stuffed it into her backpack.***Huo Yao dragged the suitcase downstairs, stepped outside, and closed the gate of the yard. Just as she did so, she heard someone honking. She looked up and cast her gaze on the black sedan that was parked not far from where she stood.The logo of the car indicated that this was a Volkswagen. The shape of the car was smooth, managing to establish a strong presence while maintaining a low-profile.Soon, someone got out of the car. It was a young man wearing a black peaked cap. After he got out, he leaned against the door and gazed at Huo Yao.Huo Yao raised her eyebrows. A calmness came over her delicate face. She dragged her suitcase and walked towards that man. \u201cAre you waiting here for me?\u201d She grinned.The young man crossed his arms in front of his chest, raised his exquisite chin, and sized Huo Yao from up to down. Eventually, his look landed on her suitcase and he laughed. \u201cHave you been banished?\u201dHuo Yao looked askew at him. \u201cA gentleman shall not eavesdrop.\u201dMin Yu chuckled. \u201cHave you forgotten the fact that there is only half a fence separating your house from mine?\u201d\u201cSo, my dear neighbor boy, have you been waiting here to mock the person who saved your life?\u201d Huo Yao put her arms in front of her chest and asked him with a spurious smile.They had known each other for almost a year now. But Huo Yao had never asked him about his name and insisted on addressing him as the neighbor boy. In the beginning, this used to bug Min Yu but now he had become used to it. During this period, he also learned a thing or two about Huo Yao\u2019s drama-like background.\u201cWhat is your plan now?\u201d Min Yu raised his eyebrows.His stunningly handsome features were hidden underneath his cap. His eyes were deep like the boundless sea, while the brightness in them was akin to a starry night.He paused for a dramatic second and added. \u201cOf course, if you cannot find any accomodation, I can take you in for now.\u201dHuo Yao stared at him and mused about his good looks secretly.Then, she put her suitcase in front of him and said, \u201cOkay! Here is a chance for you to return my past favors.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He understood her intention without any words having been spoken. \u201cWhere do you want me to send you?\u201d He laughed.Huo Yao snapped her fingers. The gesture was elegant yet naughty at the same time. She said cheekily, \u201cThe train station.\u201dThe county was small but its geographic location was really advantageous. A small train station was set up in the county. The biological parents of the original owner of this body were living in City S. Since, there was no non-stop train to City S, she would have to change trains on her way.Min Yu looked at her with a funny expression on his face and couldn\u2019t help but ask her. \u201cIs that it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Huo Yao nodded.Reading the complicated expression on his face, she spent another two seconds thinking and proposed by saying, \u201cIf you cannot accept using such a simple way to repay my kindness, you can drive me to the airport instead. After all, we were neighbors for a year. I suppose after this we will never meet again.\u201dThe drive to the train station was about 20 minutes but it would take at least three to four hours to reach the airport.Min Yu\u2019s expressions had grown more complex, but it was concealed underneath the peaked cap which he was wearing. Usually, he was able to remain calm under any circumstances but right now, there were clear signs of him losing his composure.He was wondering if he should leak some real information about himself to this silly girl. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t even realize that she had missed the opportunity to ride his coattails.***Four hours later, at the municipal airport.Huo Yao got off from the car and took out her suitcase from the trunk. She thought for a few seconds and then went up and knocked at the window on the driver\u2019s side.Soon, the window was lowered. Min Yu was really keen to hear what Huo Yao was about to say.Huo Yao took out an unlabelled bottle from her bag and said, \u201cThis is for you. See you, never again.\u201dWith that said, she threw the bottle into the car and dragged her suitcase away. She was gone before Min Yu could say anything in return.Min Yu picked up the small bottle that had landed accurately in the storage compartment of the car. He looked up at the girl who was fast disappearing from his vision and stroked the bottom of the bottle. All of a sudden, his thin lips curled into a smile. He found her parting words to be amusing.Well, well, see me never again?**In the doctor\u2019s cabin at the hospital.He Xiaoman was staring at the doctor in disbelief. \u201cSir, did you say that my mom is getting better?\u201dThe doctor was holding a few reports containing her mother\u2019s test results. He nodded again. \u201cYes, her current physical condition is good overall. As long as she doesnt get agitated often and stays calm, the probability of her future angina pectoris acting up again is very low.\u201dHe Xiaoman was puzzled. Somehow, she didn\u2019t think this doctor was reliable. Her mom had been suffering from angina pectoris for decades now. She had gotten her mom checked in many major hospitals and all the doctors\u2019 diagnosis had been that her situation was not optimistic.\u201cRight, Mrs. He, I meant to ask you this. Has your mom been receiving any treatment in another hospital recently? What medicine has she taken?\u201d The doctor rattled out the questions, one after another.He had been the attending doctor for Yang Qiuhua for the longest time. During all those years, every time she fell ill, he was the one who had treated her. But during the past year, she had barely visited the hospital. As a result, the test results today came as a surprise to him.He Xiaoman shook her head, still baffled. \u201cNo, my mom has been staying at home all this time. I wanted to take her to a provincial hospital but she refused, not to mention refusing any other form of treatment. As for medicine\u2026\u201dAs she said those words, for some strange reason, she remembered the moment when Huo Yao had given that glass of brown water to her mom.He Xiaoman stopped midway through her answer, which confused the doctor. He could not help but prod her. \u201cMrs. He?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her mom\u2019s disease had defeated many doctors. Where could that wild kid have gotten any special medicine from?The doctor cracked a joke and said, \u201cThen this must be a miracle.\u201dHe Xiaoman managed to put on a fake smile in response. She had decided that she would get Yang Qiuhua to another hospital for a check-up after they returned to City S.****By the time she arrived at City S, it was already 10 at night. Huo Yao got off the plane and switched on her phone. Instantly, she received a surge of text messages and WeChat messages. Even before she had a chance to read those messages, her phone started ringing.The call was from a number that she did not recognize.She paused for a second and then pressed on the \u2018answer\u2019 button. An unfamiliar voice of a young man came through from the other side.The caller was none other than Huo Yanxi, the biological big brother of the owner of this body.Huo Yao was a bit surprised that Huo Yanxi would be waiting at the airport. Then, she remembered that she had sent her grandma, Yang Qiuhua, a message before she boarded the plane. She did not quiz Huo Yanxi on this and simply told him, \u201cI\u2019ll be out in five minutes.\u201dWith that, she hung up and stuffed her phone into her pocket randomly. Post that, she headed toward the Baggage Claims location, following the signboards at the airport.Huo Yao went towards the exit shortly after retrieving her suitcase. She ran her eyes through the waiting crowd and soon noticed a young man with a slim figure. He was currently on the phone.Huo Yao adjusted her backpack and dragged her suitcase along as she went towards that man.Several months ago, when the biological parents of the owner of this body had come to meet her, they showed her the pictures of the four brothers. She had a good memory and the genes of the Huo Family were strong. Her brothers were easily recognizable. Hence, she managed to pick out her brother from the crowd, immediately.Huo Yanxi hung up his phone. He was just thinking that his sister whom he had never met was about to come out. Since he wasn\u2019t sure of how she looked, he browsed through his phone and looked at her picture that he had saved to \u2018Favorites\u2019 on his WeChat.5He had just raised his head and was about to look for her when he found that a girl was standing in front of him.She was in white sportswear, with a black backpack on her left shoulder, and a mid-sized suitcase in her right hand. Her complexion was fair and the face was without any makeup. Her facial features were exquisite and beautiful. At this moment, she was staring at him with clear, bright eyes and did not show any signs of shyness.Huo Yanxi was surprised. He checked the picture on his phone again. This girl resembled the girl in the picture but he was still uncertain somehow. \u201cYaoyao?\u201dHuo Yao nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d She gave a brief reply.Huo Yanxi scratched his head. Disbelief was clearly visible on his good-looking face. A long moment later, he finally found his words. \u201cYou look a bit\u2026 different from the picture.\u201dHuo Yao raised her eyebrows. Since she was tall enough, she was able to catch a glimpse of the picture which Huo Yanxiao had pulled up on his phone.In the picture, the girl\u2019s two long braids dangled onto her chest. The blusher on her cheeks was bright and she was showing a cheesy and tacky victory sign with her hand. This was the standard style of a village girl.2The vein on Huo Yao\u2019s forehead popped up. She remembered this picture. A while back, Huo Yanxi had friended her on WeChat and asked her for a picture. Huo Yao was never fond of selfies so she dug out a selfie clicked by the original owner of the body and had sent it to him.Looking at the picture, Huo Yao could see why Huo Yanxi was stumped.Huo Yao cleared her throat and maintained a straight face while saying, \u201cPerhaps, I am not photogenic?\u201d1Huo Yanxi once again cast a glance at her outrageously beautiful face and his mouth twitched.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her words seemed to carry unexplained undertones.Huo Yanxi was wearing a custom-made suit. There was an innate elegance and gracefulness in every action he performed. He was nothing like how he had been described to her \u2013 \u201cpoor kid who would make no effort to seek progress\u201d.1This was something that she pondered over.How interesting!Huo Yanxi was about to ask Huo Yao as to what was different about him when he looked up and saw someone. That person made his lips break into an indulgent smile involuntarily. He waved his hand and called out in a pampering voice. \u201cXiaxia.\u201dHuo Yao turned her gaze, following his eyes. Not far from where they stood, a tall and slender girl wearing a white dress was hurrying over to their side. She was wearing sunglasses so Huo Yao could not see her expression clearly, yet.\u201cBrother, I am sorry that I am late. There was a traffic jam on my way here.\u201d Lu Xia was panting as she explained this.\u201cThat is quite alright.\u201d Huo Yanxi shook his head. Sweat was visible on her face due to her rush to get here quickly. Huo Yanxi immediately fished out some tissues and handed them over to her.Lu Xia took the tissues from him, gratefully. She removed her sunglasses and tucked them in her collar, gracefully. \u201cThank you.\u201d She directed a sweet smile towards Huo Yanxi.Huo Yanxi just patted her head gently. They seemed to be very intimate with each other.4Huo Yao observed this little interaction between the two of them with a grin. She didn\u2019t have to use any of her brain cells to realise that Xiaxia was the girl who had been mistakenly picked up by the Huo Family at the hospital, all those years ago.Her former name was Huo Xia which had been changed to Lu Xia after she returned to the Lu Family.She was not particularly beautiful but just as He Xiaoman had mentioned, Lu Xia was highly cultured and fully steeped in propriety. Probably because of the long, white dress which she was wearing, she seemed to possess an inherent grace.Huo Yao did not hide the fact that she was sizing Lu Xia from up to down. Eventually, Lu Xia turned to look at Huo Yao as if she had noticed the existence of Huo Yao only now.1This girl was breathtaking!Her bright eyes were sparkling. Her grin was a tantalizing mixture of cynicism, mischief and a cool attitude. There was an indifferent and casual air around her.Lu Xia was clearly surprised by Huo Yao.\u201cRight, this is my baby sister, Yaoyao.\u201d Huo Yanxi pointed to Huo Yao and made the introduction.When Lu Xia heard the words \u2018my baby sister\u2019 uttered by Huo Yanxi, her grip on her bag tightened subconsciously. She felt as if something had been snatched away from her. The smile on her face dimmed a little, as well.7But Huo Yanxi failed to detect the change in Lu Xia. He turned to look at Huo Yao and said, \u201cAnd this is\u2026.\u201d\u201cI know who she is.\u201d Huo Yao interrupted Huo Yanxi in a lazy tone. She looked at her watch and asked him. \u201cShould we find a place to grab a bite first?\u201dHuo Yanxi did not need to finish his introduction of Lu Xia anymore. He picked up Huo Yao\u2019s suitcase and said contritely, \u201cSorry, I have been rambling on. Let\u2019s go to the car. Mom and dad are worried that you might be hungry. They just called to remind me.\u201dHuo Yao simply nodded her head and did not refuse his help with her suitcase. She adjusted her backpack on her shoulder and followed him out.Lu Xia watched wordlessly as the two of them started walking away. She was beginning to get a bad feeling about this. Since she was young, she had never been ignored by anyone, not even once. But now that Huo Yao had come back, not only had she taken away Huo Yanxi\u2019s attention, she even managed to diminish her presence without lifting a finger\u2026Lu Xia had originally assumed Huo Yao to be nothing more than a simple village girl. But the encounter just now seemed to indicate otherwise.1Lu Xia lowered her gaze and was still contemplating over this when she heard some shrill cries. The next thing she knew, few girls had surrounded her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How lucky am I!\u201d\u201cXiaxia looks so beautiful in real life and seems to be so gentle.\u201d\u201cMy darling Xiaxia, can you sign something for us?\u201dThe girls standing around Lu Xia did not even try to lower their voices. Soon, their shouts caught the attention of other people milling inside the airport. Many people stopped and even Huo Yao and Huo Yanxi paused in their steps and turned around to look at Lu Xia.Lu Xia was surprised that she would run into some fans here. She adjusted her expression and put on a shy smile, greeting those girls with a friendly attitude. She graciously agreed to take pictures with them, as well.In the meantime, she was stealing glances at Huo Yao, who stood some distance away.\u201cXiaxia has been talented in dancing and singing since she was a child. She joined a girls\u2019 group not long ago. Her agency thinks highly of her and has managed to win her a spot on a talent show. I heard that the talent show is quite popular. I guess those girls are her fans.\u201dHuo Yanxiao looked at Lu Xia who was standing in the circle of her admirers while he explained this to Huo Yao.Huo Yao did not seem to be envious or affected by his words at all. She just gave a bland \u2018oh\u2019 as a response. The phone was buzzing incessantly in her pocket. She shifted her gaze away from Lu Xia and fished out her phone.It was a WeChat message.Y: [Miss Big Shot, help me!]1Huo Yao rubbed her forehead. Her answer revealed her impatience: [Piss off.]Y: [Miss Big Shot, don\u2019t be like this. You cannot leave me alone.]Huo Yao\u2019s lips stretched into a cold grin as she stabbed the screen with her long and delicate fingers: [Solve your own problems.]Having clicked \u2018Send\u2019, Huo Yao blocked the contact on her phone.After the person, \u2018Y\u2019 typed and sent out a long message, the only reply received back was: [Message delivery failed. Message delivery denied.]Y: (\u03a9\u0414\u03a9)!!!4While Huo Yao was busy chatting on her phone, Lu Xia, who had finished taking pictures with her fans, came over to where Huo Yao stood. Those girls were unwilling to leave, so they followed Lu Xia and two of the fans were still filming her on their phones.Huo Yao put her phone back in her pocket. It just so happened that she looked up and saw the two girls who were shooting the video. Huo Yao thought about it and unhurriedly put on a black mask.Lu Xia found it strange that Huo Yao decided to wear a mask all of a sudden. Though on second thoughts, she felt relieved.The Huo family had great genes and everyone in the Huo Family was fairly attractive. Lu Xia did not wish her fans to catch a glimpse of Huo Yao\u2019s spectacular face.Lu Xia began to apologize to them. \u201cI am sorry. I didn\u2019t know that I would run into some fans at the airport. Sorry about the wait.\u201dThough she was making it sound like an apology, Huo Yao could tell from her raised chin that she was deliberately flaunting her popularity.There was no turbulence in Huo Yao\u2019s eyes. She just shot Lu Xia a casual glance and looked away.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Huo Yanxi replied.***Huo Yanxi\u2019s car was a common, mid-range car and fell in the range of anywhere between two to three hundred thousand bucks. While the car was not expensive, Huo Yao could deduce that he was not a careless person who would neglect his work, as had been claimed earlier.After he put Huo Yao\u2019s suitcase into the trunk, he looked at the time and then asked Lu Xia, \u201cXiaxia, how did you get here?\u201dLu Xia stole a peek at Huo Yao and then thought of an answer. \u201cThe chauffeur drove me here.\u201dHuo Yanxi was about to say something when Lu Xia came forward and clung to his arm intimately. It seemed like a natural and endearing gesture on her part.\u201cBrother, can I ask you something?\u201d She said in an overly sweet voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With innocent expressions and carefully applied make-up, she looked like an angel. \u201cI have been focusing a lot on the talent show recently. I am feeling bad that I haven\u2019t visited mom and dad in a long time. Yaoyao has also just come back. I believe she may find her life here somewhat unfamiliar. I want to come along and stay home for a couple of days. For one thing, I can spend some quality time with mom and dad, for another, I can help Yaoyao get adjusted.\u201d1Huo Yanxi thought for a few seconds before he nodded in agreement. \u201cGood. We won\u2019t have to worry so much if you can stay with Yaoyao.\u201d5Lu Xia chuckled lightly at his response. Then, she raised her chin at Huo Yao and let go of Huo Yanxi\u2019s arm. She went ahead and sat in the front passenger seat.She was behaving as if she was the hostess here.3Huo Yao raised her eyebrows at the other girl\u2019s childish behavior. However, her curled lips were covered by her mask. She did not say anything and simply opened the door and sat on the back seat.***Lu Xia spent their entire way back to tell Huo Yanxi stories about the girl group which she had joined. From there, she shifted to talking about the talent show. Every now and then, Lu Xia would steal glances at Huo Yao from the rearview mirror. Since Huo Yao had taken her mask off, Lu Xia was actively seeking traces of envy on her face.However, Huo Yao remained unmoved. She did nothing except for playing on her phone. She was lost in her own world as if nothing else mattered to her.This was such a huge blow to Lu Xia\u2019s superiority complex.Lu Xia told herself that Huo Yao could remain this calm because this village girl came from a small county and knew nothing about the entertainment industry.4She soon came up with another idea. She switched from her conversation of the entertainment world and directed her questions towards Huo Yao. \u201cYaoyao, we were born in the same year. You should be starting your senior year in high school as well, right?\u201dHuo Yao\u2019s fingers paused while on the phone. A moment later, she looked up slowly. The gentle, pale light in the car cast a hue over her face, offsetting some of the sharpness in her eyes.\u201cYes.\u201d She replied without any emotion.Lu Xia blinked. Somehow, in this moment, she felt Huo Yao was quite seductive, especially when complimented by her hoarse voice.Lu Xia stopped her thoughts from showing on her face and put on a forced smile. \u201cI heard from my mother that when you left my grandmother\u2019s place, you obtained all the documents for school transfer.\u201dShe had deliberately stressed upon the words \u2018my mother\u2019 and \u2018my grandmother\u2019. Of course, one would not notice if one did not listen carefully.Huo Yao grinned and darted a meaningful look towards Lu Xia.Lu Xia felt her heart miss a beat. Immediately, she looked away to avoid eye contact with Huo Yao. The natural grace had disappeared from Lu Xia\u2019s voice but she continued speaking, \u201cHave you picked out a school yet? I can ask my father to help if you need it. My mother told me that your grades weren\u2019t exactly\u2026\u201d\u201cThank you, but no. I have decided upon which school to attend.\u201d Huo Yao cut her off, carelessly.The word \u2018great\u2019 remained stuck in Lu Xia\u2019s throat. A long moment later, she managed to speak even though the smile had frozen on her face unnaturally now. \u201cHave you? Which one?\u201dHuo Yanxi, who was busy driving, was surprised to hear this as well.Because of his work, Huo Yanxi was away from home often. Even so, he was aware that his parents had been bothered about the school transfer. They were contemplating which school to choose for his baby sister who had been taken away by another family at birth and grew up in a small county after that.He had realised that his parents\u2019 struggle stemmed from the fact that his sister\u2019s grades were bad. But his parents were unwilling to send her off to an average school. At the same time, they were worried that she could get an inferiority feeling even if they found some connections and managed to get her admitted to a prominent school. This was because she may fall behind in her studies in the new prominent school as well\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His sister seemed very composed while uttering those words. It appeared that she was not joking about having decided which school to go to.Huo Yao adjusted her sitting posture. She crossed her legs, and replied in an emotionless voice. \u201cNo.1 Municipal Middle School.\u201dAs soon as she finished her answer, a strange expression spread on Lu Xia\u2019s face. She couldn\u2019t help but give Huo Yao another look, this time with disbelief. \u201cNo.1 Middle School? The one in the city?\u201dHuo Yao\u2019s answer was just as brief and indifferent as before. \u201cYep.\u201dLu Xia felt she had just heard the funniest joke in the entire world. She could have bought it if Huo Yao said, \u201cNo.11 Middle School\u201d.But the No.1 Municipal Middle School? How was that possible?It was the best high school in the city and ranked amongst the top 5 in the country. The students had to take an entrance exam to get in and those who got the admission, were straight-A students. Huo Yao, on the other hand, had managed to attend a key school in the small county, and that also because a lot of money was spent to secure her a spot. Lu Xia hid the contempt in her eyes. Huo Yao was a really stupid girl.1\u201cThe standard to get into No.1 Municipal Middle School is pretty high.\u201d Lu Xia mentioned with a spurious smile on her face.Huo Yanxi also thought that his sister was getting ahead of herself. To help her save face after this big talk, he cleared his throat and chimed in. \u201cLet\u2019s decide after we talk it over with mom and dad.\u201dLu Xia knew that Huo Yanxi was trying to help Huo Yao, so she decided not to pursue this topic any further. \u201cLet me know if you need me to do something. My father knows the principals of several schools in the city. At his one word, she would manage to get in most of the places.\u201dAt this point, Huo Yanxi turned on the music. He did not care much about Lu Xia\u2019s proposal and merely said, \u201cHmm\u2026\u201d.2Huo Yao tapped a finger on her leg in a desultory kind of way. She was not in the mood to continue the conversation and shifted her focus outside the car\u2019s window.On the street, traffic was busy and neon lights were glistening. The bustling scene at this time of the night was enough to demonstrate the prosperity of the city.This was something she had not seen in that small county where she came from.4***Not long afterwards, they drove into a neighborhood that seemed to have seen better days. The environment here was not great.Because this was an old neighborhood, the buildings were not very tall. Huo Family\u2019s house was on the top floor, a duplex apartment.Mr. and Mrs. Huo were waiting by the door. When they heard the elevator\u2019s sound, the two of them looked at each other nervously and then shifted their eyes towards the elevator.Soon, Huo Yanxi and Lu Xia came out with Huo Yao trailing behind them.\u201cDad, mom, we picked up Yaoyao.\u201d Lu Xia smiled brightly and addressed them in a pleasant voice.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Song Ning, who was Mrs. Huo merely glanced at Lu Xia before turning her entire focus to Huo Yao who was standing behind her. Song Ning had to pause before she summoned enough courage to go to Huo Yao. She was feeling excited and fearful, all at once.Lu Xia sensed she had been ignored in this instance and her smiling face turned stiff for a second.3Huo Family was not rich but since she was the youngest in the family, her foster parents had always treated her well. But now that love was about to be taken away by Huo Yao.Lu Xia did not care for their pampering but still, their behavior made her feel upset. She tried hard to conceal that frustration.1Song Ning walked over to Huo Yao and stared at her. Her biological daughter looked exactly like her. Then, Song Ning cast a look at Lu Xia. Mixed feelings began to surge in Song Ning\u2019s heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They would joke about how little Lu Xia looked like Song Ning and ask if Song Ning had picked up the wrong baby at the hospital.They were not trying to say that Lu Xia was ugly. It was just that all the other kids in the Huo Family were as delicate as jade. Compared to her brothers, Lu Xia\u2019s looks were just too plain. To make the matters worse, Song Ning and her husband were great lookers, as well. Therefore, Song Ning\u2019s friends would always joke about this.Now that Song Ning thought of it, her friends\u2019 jokes had turned out to be a prophecy. Song Ning stopped her mind from slipping away any further.\u201cYaoyao,\u201d she said, softly.Just like before, Huo Yao maintained a straight face. She did not seem overly excited to meet her birth parents and her nod to Song Ning was more out of politeness.Standing by them, Lu Xia thought this was the perfect opportunity to grab attention. \u201cMom, Yaoyao has just come back from the countryside. I think she is still trying to adjust to the whole environment.\u201dShe was pretending to put in a good word for Huo Yao.Several months ago, Song Ning had met Huo Yao. The former must have realized at the time that Huo Yao was slightly unsociable and eccentric. Right now, Song Ning had just been a bit disappointed that Huo Yao would not call her mom but other than that, she didn\u2019t think that anything was wrong.3After all, Huo Yao was given to the wrong family and was sent to a small county by the Lu Family. It was only natural that she would undergo a transitional period to adapt herself after she returned to her birth parents.There was no hurry.Song Ning darted a look at Lu Xia but she hid her complicated feelings well enough. Soon, Song Ning produced a detached smile and said, \u201cXiaxia, thank you so much for what you did tonight. I am grateful that you went to the airport to pick Yaoyao up. It is getting late. Your parents will not be happy that you have come to our house.\u201d3After a pause, Song Ning cast a glance at her oldest son who was standing on the side. \u201cYanxi, please send Miss Lu home.\u201d9Song Ning had addressed Lu Xia as \u2018Xiaxia\u2019 a moment ago and then immediately changed it to \u2018Miss Lu\u2019.Lu Xia\u2019s face reddened at once. Before she realised it, her lips had moved and instinctively she said, \u201cMom\u2026\u201dSong Ning gazed at Lu Xia. The former felt sad in her heart but she did not show it.Song Ning gathered her thoughts and the smile on her face became even more aloof. Before Lu Xia could say anything more, Song Ning interrupted her. \u201cFrom now on, you should call me Aunt Song. That is the correct thing to do.\u201d1Huo Yao was surprised to hear this.Song Ning was graceful and refined. She was in her fifties but wrinkles could hardly be seen on her face. People could easily mistake her as a thirty years old lady. She was smiling but the look on her face indicated an aggressiveness that could not be neglected.This was something not commonly seen in the average married woman.Huo Yao found it interesting.Lu Xia stared at her foster mother. She had been thoroughly embarrassed tonight. She bit her lips and tears began to surge in her eyes. Her face turned pale as if she had been wronged.She could not understand why the person who had loved her so dearly before, could become so distant all of a sudden. Was it simply because of the return of the biological daughter?12How hypocritical was that!Lu Xia felt that all of them had deceived her.2For a moment, things became awkward.\u201cEh-ahem.\u201d Huo Jinyan, Huo Yao\u2019s father, who had not said a thing till now, cleared his throat.\u201cYanxi, give Xiaxia a ride back to her home, first.\u201dHe was attempting to break the ice but somehow, things became even more awkward.Huo Yanxi nodded. He didn\u2019t know why his parents wouldn\u2019t want Lu Xia to stay. However, he did not voice his questions out loud.8After all, Lu Xia was the precious daughter of the wealthy Lu Family, which meant that her identity was unusual. Besides, the Lu Family were not people to be messed with.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As soon as Huo Yanxi and Lu Xia entered the elevator, Song Ning\u2019s expressions underwent a drastic change. She began to display greater care, and said to Huo Yao with particular gentleness, \u201cMy dear girl, come on inside\u2026\u201dUnfortunately, the elevator door had not closed yet and Lu Xia happened to see the change in her foster mother\u2019s attitude. Immediately, Lu Xia\u2019s face turned ghastly pale.11**Huo Family\u2019s house was not large. However, it had two floors and could not be called small, either. The house had classical Chinese style decoration and all the furniture pieces were made from rosewood. The layout and fixtures in the house told Huo Yao that the inhabitants possessed good tastes.Huo Yao took her time and looked around slowly. Eventually, a scroll of calligraphy and painting hung on the wall caught her eyes. That scroll came as a surprise to her.But then, she looked away and thought that she had been mistaken. She dismissed the idea that the scroll was an authentic piece of work.The Huo Family did not appear to be an impoverished household like she had thought originally. That being said, she didn\u2019t think the Huo Family was wealthy enough to afford such a valuable piece of famous authentic work.Hence, the scroll was most likely a fake.Her father noticed how her gaze lingered on the scroll for a while. He had been wondering anxiously about how to break the ice and establish some connection with this daughter of his. He glanced at the scroll and thought of an idea.\u201cYaoyao, do you like calligraphy as well?\u201d He asked, smiling cheerfully.Huo Yao raised her eyes and looked at her father. Then she replied in a casual tone. \u201cNot interested.\u201d3Huo Jinyan was suddenly at a loss for words. He had barely come up with a common point as a conversation starter. But with her abrupt answer, all those words were now stuck in his throat. It took him a long while before he could utter another word again. \u201cOh, you are not interested\u2026\u201dHuo Yao noticed that this was a huge blow to him. She thought for two seconds and then added the next line. \u201cWe have different interests.\u201dHuo Jinyan once again put on a smile of a loving father. He was ready to continue the conversation further. \u201cThen, what are your interests?\u201dHuo Yao thought of her real self before she became the owner of this body. All of a sudden, she sunk into silence. A few seconds later, she looked up at her father and answered solemnly. \u201cStudying.\u201dHuo Jinyan\u2019s lips twitched visibly. He could hardly keep a straight face.A slacker who always skipped classes at school had just said that her interest was \u2013 \u2018to study\u2019.2Mr. Huo stared at his daughter, quietly. She didn\u2019t seem to be joking about it. All of a sudden, he began to wonder if he was fed misleading information when he had enquired with the school faculties back in the small county.With one look, he could tell that his daughter was both adorable and ambitious.\u201cHey, are you bragging about your damn calligraphy and painting again?\u201d2Song Ning heard her husband mentioning \u2018calligraphy\u2019. She came out from the kitchen to set the table and glared at him.\u201cGo and bring out bowls and chopsticks!\u201d She shouted at him in an imposing manner.\u201cI wasn\u2019t bragging.\u201dMr. Huo scratched his nose in embarrassment. Saying so, he followed his wife\u2019s orders and went to the kitchen.He was still mumbling. \u201cHow come you always say my antiques are shabby? That scroll is\u2026\u201dHis voice had dropped down to a whisper. Therefore, Huo Yao failed to register what he was saying.But her biological mother had shouted \u2018damn calligraphy and painting\u2019 very loudly and clearly.*After dinner, Song Ning took Huo Yao upstairs.There were four bedrooms on this floor. The one allotted for Huo Yao was situated at the back of the corridor on the right side. Song Ning opened the door and said to Huo Yao, \u201cYour fourth brother used to live in this room. He doesn\u2019t live here at present and will only come back probably in a year\u2019s time. So, I re-decorated his room for you. Take a look.

Pink colour assaulted Huo Yao\u2019s senses within seconds. The wallpaper, the closet, the king-sized bed, the curtain, and even the desk\u2026 Apart from the floor, everything in the room was pink.13Huo Yao, \u201c\u2026\u201dIt was severely offending to the eye.1With a proud expression on her face, Song Ning looked at the princess themed room that she had meticulously designed and continued. \u201cI asked a famous designer to put together this plan. What do you think? Isn\u2019t it fairy-like, dreamy and sweet?\u201dHuo Yao curled her lips, involuntarily. She shot another glance at the room but could not find appropriate words to compliment this style which had completely blown away all kinds of aesthetic values.She knew very well that any famous designer worth their mettle wouldn\u2019t do something like this to jeopardize their brands. Therefore, Huo Yao suspected that her mom was most likely a victim of a scam.After all, many unethical home decoration companies often deceived people by lying about their designers\u2019 credentials.To avoid disappointing an enthusiastic looking Song Ning, Huo Yao replied sagely after a few seconds. \u201cThe fact that you like it, is all that matters.\u201dThose words were followed by a yawn. The warm light in the room spilled over her beautiful face, clearly showing signs of fatigue.Song Ning\u2019s nose wrinkled in confusion. Somehow, she found her daughter\u2019s words ambiguous. That being said, since Huo Yao was feeling sleepy, Song Ning decided not to probe her any further. She told Huo Yao to rest well and left the room.After the door was closed behind her, Huo Yao found herself alone in a room overflowing with pink. With a troubled expression, she rubbed her forehead.Suppressing a sigh, she opened her suitcase, took out her pajamas, and went to the bathroom.She was indeed exhausted. After her match in the city, she had hurried back to the county early in the morning. Post that, she had headed to the airport to fly to City S without catching a break. She had almost spent an entire day travelling. Resilient as she was, her body was feeling the fatigue at this moment.***At the same time, Lu Xia had returned to the Lu Family. She couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Huo Yao and her foster parents\u2019 attitude. She was so upset that she could not fall asleep. She tossed and turned on her bed for a long while. Eventually, she grabbed her phone and began to browse her microblog.Ever since Lu Xia had participated in the \u2018Star Training Camp\u2019, she gained countless fans who liked her sweet voice and her innocent looks. Besides, her agency had devoted a lot of effort to make her well-liked and were trying to build her persona through several channels. As expected, her pictures with those fans at the airport tonight, had become a trending search already.The pictures were good, and her fans must have posted them after they carefully tweaked the photos. In merely two hours, there were over ten thousand comments. For a new star who had not yet debuted on stage, this was insane.The only flaw in those otherwise perfect pictures, was that Huo Yao was present in two of them.The clicks did not capture her face, and the fans also added some blurs in the background. However, with that tall and slender figure and this kind of detached bearing, even after her face being obscured, Huo Yao was still able to demonstrate her beauty.In fact, the blur became the most intriguing and focal point of the photo.Lu Xia frowned in displeasure. No matter how she looked at them, she still thought those two photos were an eyesore. She finally calmed herself down and began to read the comments.Some of the fans had indeed expressed their curiosity about the girl wearing the mask. However, their comments did not stir up any further conversation. Nobody paid much attention to those posts after a while.Lu Xia breathed in a sigh of relief. She scrolled down to read the comments which were talking her up. The depression which she had been suffering all night long, finally died down.1She thought she must have gone crazy for a second there to have a weird sense of crisis.Even though that village girl, Huo Yao was a beauty, she was still a trophy girl who was vulgar and without any strong attributes. She had returned to the Huo Family. So what?1She will never be better than me!!3Lu Xia sneered and turned off her phone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her biological clock was always spot on. She would get up every morning at 6, no matter what.1However, since she was in a new environment, she did indulge herself for a bit more and snoozed for a few minutes before she eventually crawled out of the bed. She dragged herself to the bathroom to freshen up. After she came out, she sat down on the ground with crossed legs and began to go through the contents of her suitcase.She had not brought too many clothes with her, just two sets. The rest of the suitcase was full of unlabeled jars and bottles, along with two old-fashioned iron boxes.4Huo Yao only took out her clothes for now. On second thought, she picked out two of the bottles as well. Then, she zipped up her suitcase but did not use the coded lock.1She ran her eyes around the room until she found the closet. She got up and pulled the suitcase along.When she opened the closet, she found it full of new clothes, which caught her unaware.The clothes did not have tags on them, but she could tell that they were new and of high quality. As for the style, Huo Yao thought that they were okay. At the very least, the clothes were classier than this horrendously pink room.She stuffed her suitcase into a corner of the closet and changed into her sportswear. She combed her long hair into a bun, and left the room.Jogging in the morning was her habit, and she would not change her ways just because she had come to a different place.*By 8am, Song Ning had already set the table for breakfast. She looked at the staircase and then at her husband who was reading the newspaper in the living room.She asked him. \u201cDo you think we should wake up our daughter for breakfast?\u201dHuo Jinyan pushed his glasses up his nose bridge and replied. \u201cShe was really tired yesterday and went to sleep quite late. I say we don\u2019t disturb her and let her sleep in.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Song Ning nodded. She was about to say something else when she heard the doorbell ring.Looking at the door, she murmured curiously. \u201cWho would come so early in the morning?\u201dHuo Jinyan put down his newspaper. \u201cCould it be the accountant?\u201dSong Ning threw a pitying glance at him. \u201cMister, today is the 20th. We have several more days before we need to go through our books.\u201dHuo Jinyan made an \u2018oh\u2019 sound and added after a moment. \u201cTell our accountant not to come here this month. Our daughter has just come back. I don\u2019t want to spook her.\u201d1Song Ning thought that her husband\u2019s proposal made sense and nodded her head in agreement. \u201cSure. Now, let me see who is at the door.\u201dShe opened the internal door and stood still for a couple of seconds when she saw that it was Huo Yao standing outside the main door. After Song Ning came back to her senses, she unlocked the security door and asked quickly. \u201cYaoyao, why are you outside?\u201dHuo Yao had just come back from her jogging. Her delicate face had turned rosy from the workout, and few hair strands were stuck on her cheek because of the sweat. She wiped off her sweat and replied. \u201cI like exercising in the morning.\u201dThat came as a surprise to Song Ning.\u201cMorning jogging is good, a good habit.\u201d She nodded in approval.But then she said something entirely different, \u201cGirls can sleep in, though. It will be good for your skin.\u201d5Huo Yao\u2019s mouth twitched.\u201cI have made breakfast. Go up quickly, take a shower, and come down for breakfast.\u201d Song Ning told Huo Yao as the latter stepped in through the door.\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cAnd there are clothes in the closet. They are all new. See if you like them. If you don\u2019t, I will get you another batch.\u201dAnother batch?Huo Yao paused in her steps. There was a complicated expression on her face. \u201cMom, has our family stumbled across some wealth overnight?\u201d1Song Ning turned around to look at her.The words, \u201cor I can ask a few designers to come and tailor make some clothes for you,\u201d remained stuck in her mouth.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The next instant, Huo Yao was enveloped into a warm hug.\u201cOh my dear girl, you just called me mom. Finally!\u201d Song Ning was so thrilled that she almost burst into tears.Huo Yao, \u201c\u2026\u201dBut this was not the main point!*Ten minutes later, Huo Yao had finished her shower and reached downstairs. She had put on a casual T-shirt and a pair of ripped jeans. The outfit was leisurely and simple, but she looked cool in it.\u201cMy daughter is so pretty.\u201d Song Ning put her hand under her chin and watched as Huo Yao came down the stairs. Huo Yao had not put on the clothes which she bought but that didn\u2019t stop her from complimenting her daughter.Huo Jinyan nodded in agreement. \u201cShe has inherited my perfect genes.\u201dSong Ning rolled her eyes at him. \u201cHave you no shame? Your daughter takes after me and that is fairly obvious.\u201d\u201cRight, right, my darling! Everything you say is right.\u201d The hen-pecked husband gave up his stance at once.Huo Yao had just reached the breakfast table and happened to hear every word of this conversation.This public display of affection was not unpleasant to her ears.Huo Yao sat down at the table. She had always been a quiet person, so during breakfast, she barely said anything. Even when Huo Jinyan and Song Ning said something to her, she would reply with monosyllabic words such as \u2018oh\u2019 or \u2018hmm\u2019.But Huo Jinyan and Song Ning did not find their daughter arrogant or offending. They just felt guilty.What kind of solitary life would their daughter must have gone through when she was a kid to become so unsociable and eccentric?On the other hand, Huo Yao had no idea about what her parents were thinking. Although, she noticed that Song Ning would rub her temples every now and then. Suddenly, Huo Yao thought of something. She headed upstairs without a word and came down after a couple of minutes.She gave Huo Jinyan and Song Ning a bottle each. These were the two little bottles which she had taken out from her suitcase earlier.\u201cThese are for you.\u201d Huo Yao said lightly, and her tone remained light as before.Song Ning took the little jar from her daughter\u2019s hand. She twisted the cap and peered inside.Looking at the contents, she asked her daughter curiously. \u201cWhat is this? This little bottle looks quite exquisite\u2026\u201dAs soon as the lid came off, a rich aroma distinctive to herbs, floated out of it. When the scent reached Song Ning\u2019s nose, she felt refreshed and very comfortable.She suffered from migraine, and ended up having severe headaches from time to time. However, no medicine could cure her predicament. She had woken up with a headache this morning but didn\u2019t want to show discomfort in front of her daughter.Inhaling this aroma, she felt that her migraine was gone all of a sudden, miraculously.\u201cYaoyao, what is this?\u201d Song Ning asked, gladly surprised. The more she smelt it, the stronger she felt the desire to stay infused in this aroma for the rest of her life.Huo Yao could tell that Song Ning was much better than before.She replied gently. \u201cSome pellets made out of few herbs. Well\u2026 it is like incense that can help you calm down and relieve headaches. \u201dHuo Yao added a bit more after a pause. \u201cPut a pellet by your bed every night. It can improve your situation.\u201dSong Ning was stunned. \u201cHow did you know about my migraine?\u201dShe was not the only one shocked. Huo Jinyan was also wearing a similar expression on his face.\u201cYou rubbed your temple several times during breakfast.\u201d Huo Yao did not say anything more than that one line.Song Ning was still puzzled. She didn\u2019t know that Huo Yao could be so thoughtful.Still\u2026Huo Yao managed to figure out that she was suffering from migraines just because she rubbed her temples. Was that even possible?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you want to cure your migraine problem once and for all\u2026\u201d Huo Yao stopped for a second before she continued speaking, \u201cLater when time permits\u2026 I will ask my friend to send over better ones.\u201dSong Ning stared at her, \u201cAre you saying that my migraine can go away permanently?\u201dHuo Yao raised her eyebrows. \u201cOf course.\u201dThis task might not be achievable for others, but for her, pff\u2026 it was nothing more than a child\u2019s play.Song Ning tapped at her nose, thoughtfully. She could not believe her daughter\u2019s words. After all, most doctors had told her that there was no permanent treatment for her migraine attacks.Song Ning noticed the small bottle in her husband\u2019s hand. \u201cHave you given the same one to your dad?\u201dThey were living in modern society. However, Huo Yao used the word \u2018pellets\u2019, and she put them into ceramic bottles, which suggested primitive simplicity as if the bottles belonged to the past centuries.Song Ning\u2019s mind was going into wild flights of fancy.Huo Yao shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen what is in mine?\u201d Huo Jinyan was also very curious to know. Till now, his attention had been fixed on his wife and he had not opened his bottle yet.A lock of hair fell on her cheek. Huo Yao tucked the hair strands behind her ear as she replied in her trademark lazy tone. \u201cThat does not contain any specific medicine. You can think of it as a kind of invigorator. You can take one every month. It will help you stay fit and strong.\u201d\u201cPff\u2026\u201dHuo Jinyan\u2019s face and ears start to burn. The little ceramic bottle almost fell from his hand.What an insult to his masculinity!\u201cHaha.\u201d Song Ning reacted to the funny look on her husband\u2019s face. She could not help but break into laughter.How adorable was her daughter? She had given her father a health boosting tonic.After a long time, Huo Jinyan heaved a silent sigh. He turned around and found a delicately carved rosewood box and carefully placed the bottle inside.He did not need it. Nevertheless, this was the first gift which he had received from his daughter. He must cherish it.Song Ning kept on rolling her eyes.Huo Yao was still thinking about Song Ning\u2019s migraine when she headed back upstairs post breakfast.Song Ning suddenly remembered the serious business she had to talk about, with Huo Yao and stopped her daughter at once. \u201cLook at me. I almost forgot the most important thing.\u201dHuo Yao raised her eyebrows and stared at her mom with crystal-clear eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s about the school transfer.\u201d Song Ning explained. In a few days, the new semester was about to begin. They needed to decide upon it within the next couple of days.\u201cYour dad and I have considered several options. I am going to share all the information with you, and then you can select the one you like.\u201d With that said, Song Ning bent over to pull out the drawer located near the table. From that, she took out a pile of brochures.\u201cSee, this is No.3 Middle School. The teachers there are average, but the good thing is that the school is close to home. You won\u2019t have to live on campus.\u201d\u201cThis is the No.11 Middle School. Their enrolment ratio of getting into prestigious and second-tier universities is low, but the chance to enter into art and music majors is much higher than that of other key middle schools.\u201d\u201cAnd this is the Desheng Foreign Language School. The tuition fee is high. However, this is an outstanding middle school that is only second to No.1 Middle School. Your dad and I really like this school.\u201dSong Ning picked out the brochure of Desheng and showed it to Huo Yao. \u201cThis school requires admission tests, but your dad and I pulled some strings. They told us that you could get in without taking the test.\u201dHuo Yao could not manage to speak at all during all this time. She let her eyes roam on the various brochures but didn\u2019t pay much attention to them. Her mind was elsewhere.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Desheng would have only two types of students, the star students, and the rich students.In a nutshell, with money, anyone could get in.Hence\u2026\u201cHave you already given them the money?\u201d After a moment of silence, Huo Yao asked a question with a serious look on her face.Her parents were startled by this solemn expression. They looked at each other and then.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dThe one giving the affirmative answer was Song Ning, and the one giving the negative one was Huo Jinyan.They hadn\u2019t gotten their stories straight yet. They looked at each other again, and both seemed to scold the other, silently.Huo Yao stared at them, grinning faintly. How amusing.Huo Yao\u2019s stare made Song Ning feel diffident. She gave a hint to her husband to explain the matter, through a gentle kick on his foot.Having received the instructions from his dear wife, Huo Jinyan cleared this throat and sat up straight. Even in his fifties, he was still really handsome. He adopted a serious attitude and explained. \u201cIf you decide to go to this school, both your mom and I will be happy.\u201dHuo Yao was relaxed when she heard this. He had answered her question indirectly. \u201cI am glad that you have not given them any money yet. That\u2019s because I have already decided which school to attend.\u201dThe Huo Family did not seem to be a poverty-stricken household but securing advantages through money was unnecessary.\u201cHave you decided already? Which one?\u201d Song Ning asked in a hurry.Huo Yao lowered her eyes and gave a brief answer. \u201cNo.1 Middle School.\u201dBoth Song Ning and Huo Jinyan were stunned into surprise.No.1 Middle School?Was there something wrong with their ears?Song Ning cleared her throat. She could not believe this. \u201cDear, did you just say\u2026 No.11 Middle School?\u201dHuo Yao put down the brochures, tilted her head, and flashed a grin. \u201cNo, No.1 Middle School.\u201d\u201cWell, are you being funny? Can you say it again? Which middle school?\u201dThey did not expect that Huo Yao could remain so nonchalant about this.Huo Yao raised her eyebrows, and her eyes were sparkling. She answered, earnestly. \u201cI am not joking. Only No.1 Middle School is up to my standard.\u201dSong Ning\u2019s facial expressions changed drastically. \u201cI know that No.1 Middle School is the best, but you don\u2019t have what it takes to go there.\u201d3She had learnt about her daughter\u2019s grades when she was in grade one of high school. She was, without a doubt, the worst student there.Huo Jinyan had been startled by her daughter\u2019s answer and involuntarily, his tone became sterner. \u201cThose attending the No.1 Middle School are the straight-A students. Your grades\u2026 Even if you manage to get in, it won\u2019t necessarily be a good thing for you.\u201dSong Ning nodded along. \u201cRight, listen to your dad. We don\u2019t need you to do so well in school. We want you to be happy. We are okay if you can get into an average university in future.\u201d3There was no need for her to graduate from any famous college to boost up the appearance of their family. All four of their sons were graduates of well-known universities. They were enough to bring prestige to the family.Therefore, Song Ning picked up the brochures and tried to stuff them into Huo Yao\u2019s hands. \u201cYaoyao, take a look at these schools. I can give a call to Desheng Middle School right now. Let\u2019s go with this one!\u201d\u201cThat is a good choice. I support your mother.\u201dHuo Yao was speechless that her parents were focussed on talking her out of attending the No.1 Middle School.\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Saying so, she got up and ran upstairs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She walked upto Song Ning and handed it over.Song Ning looked at the letter and took it after a slight hesitation. \u201cThis is\u2026\u201d1\u201cAcceptance Letter from No.1 Middle School.\u201d Huo Yao sounded composed.However, Song Ning was still in disbelief. The stamp in the center of the envelope struck her immobile.For a long moment, she was unable to open the envelope.Huo Jinyan snatched the Acceptance Letter from his wife and opened it up, impatiently. After reading it, he looked up at Huo Yao with a baffled expression.Their daughter had said it a couple of times that she had decided upon her school. What she meant was that she had not selected one from the options which they provided. She seemed to have made her choice a long time ago.The date on the Acceptance Letter was from last month.But\u2026 weren\u2019t their daughter\u2019s grades a disaster?Why would No.1 Middle School accept her?Song Ning finally came back to her senses. She read through the Acceptance Letter carefully to make sure that her husband did not read it wrong. Just like him, she had so many questions in her heart. She looked at Huo Yao, ready with her queries.Suddenly, Huo Yao\u2019s phone began to buzz in her pocket. She took it out and saw that the number was unknown. A hint of darkness came over her eyes.\u201cI have to answer this first.\u201d She said to Song Ning and Huo Jinyan and excused herself.Then, she walked out to the balcony and closed the door behind her.Song Ning looked at her receding back and mumbled. \u201cSay, why do you think our daughter has an Acceptance Letter from the No.1 Middle School? Look at the stamp. Do you think this could be a fake?\u201dHuo Jinyan thought for a long time and finally said, \u201cI don\u2019t think this is fake.\u201dHe shook his head, as if still perplexed.\u201cBut think of the standard for admission into the No.1 Middle School. How can Yaoyao get through, with her grades? Didn\u2019t Xiaxia tell us that she had to bribe someone to get into the middle school which she was in?\u201dSong Ning only doubted about the acceptance letter because she knew her daughter was not a good student.Huo Jinyan considered that possibility before saying, \u201cDon\u2019t overthink this. You must trust your daughter.\u201dSong Ning sighed. \u201cI am not saying I don\u2019t trust her. I am just afraid that someone could have fooled her.\u201dHuo Jinyan looked at her in puzzlement.Song Ning was anxious because he did not seem to show deep fatherly love towards their daughter, as she had expected.Worriedly, she elaborated on her previous sentence. \u201cOur daughter grew up in the wrong family in that small county. She has never seen the dark side of society. Think about it. Where did she get this Acceptance Letter from?\u201d\u201cThe school mailed it to her. Where else?\u201d Huo Jinyan was even more confused about his wife\u2019s anxiety.Song Ning scratched her head. \u201cHow do I put this? I am just wondering if your daughter has made friends with the wrong crowd. Do you remember what that teacher told us when we went to the county city to ask about her?\u201dHuo Jinyan frowned and then darted a glance at Huo Yao who was still on the phone call in the balcony.She was leaning to one side with her left hand on the railing. Her finger was tapping casually on it. With the door between them, he could not hear what she was saying.Soon, she hung up and turned around. His gaze met her eyes. She raised her eyebrows as if saying that she had been aware of his scrutiny all this while.Flustered, Huo Jinyan felt his heart skip a beat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Before Song Ning and Huo Jinyan could say anything, Huo Yao put forward her question first. \u201cMom, what is our mailing address? A friend of mine is going to send me something.\u201dShe was ready with her phone to take down the address.Song Ning told her the same but immediately, she lowered her voice and asked anxiously. \u201cYour friend? Someone you befriended when you were staying with Lu Xia\u2019s grandma?\u201dHuo Yao was texting someone. Her fingers paused for a second when Song Ning asked the question. She gave Song Ning a look and nodded her head.Song Ning was about to ask more questions when Huo Jinyan yanked her arm and shook his head at her.Our daughter has just come back, so we cannot intervene too much. There will be ample time for it.Huo Yao finished her message and put her phone back to her pocket. Then she asked Song Ning. \u201cWere you about to ask me something?\u201dSong Ning hesitated for a bit. Eventually, she shook her head with a smile. \u201cNope.\u201dShe thought for a few seconds. \u201cI almost forgot. Xiaxia is in No.1 Middle School as well. I will give her a call later and ask her to look after you. You both grew up in the wrong families but she is a nice girl. I think the two of you can get along.\u201dWhat Xiaxia said last night was unpleasant. Even so, Song Ning felt she would be less concerned if Lu Xia could take care of Huo Yao, who had just come to a new environment. At the end of the day, Song Ning believed Lu Xia was someone she knew well.Huo Yao remembered when she first met Lu Xia last night and how \u2018bitchy\u2019 she was. But to her mother\u2019s suggestion, Huo Yao just grinned and agreed.\u201cDid you know that Xiaxia is in a talent show? What is it called?\u201d The name of the show escaped Song Ning\u2019s mind. She slapped her forehead gently.\u201cThe Star Training Camp.\u201d Huo Jinyan jumped in.\u201cRight, Star Training Camp. Yaoyao, have you watched the show? I heard that it\u2019s quite popular.\u201d Song Ning thought that all young people must be following this show.But Huo Yao was not interested. \u201cI have not.\u201dSong Ning was about to say, \u201cYou can cast a vote for Xiaxia\u201d.But after Huo Yao gave her the answer, those words changed. \u201cAh, you don\u2019t watch it?\u201d\u201cNo. It is a waste of time.\u201d Huo Yao added after a second. \u201cAffects studying.\u201dSong Ning could not find an appropriate response to that.Huo Yao did not wish to continue this nonsense, so she switched the subject. \u201cMy brothers don\u2019t live here?\u201dSong Ning said, \u201cThey have not stayed here for a long time. They all have their respective work to take care of.\u201dA few seconds later, fearing that her daughter might misinterpret those words, Song Ning explained. \u201cYour return is kind of sudden. Apart from your big brother, your other three brothers are not in the city. You will meet them when they have time to come back.\u201dHuo Yao was intrigued by what Song Ning said. Huo Yao thought for a bit and decided to seek clarification. \u201cThey all have their own work?\u201dSong Ning was confused. Why would her daughter ask such a question? Still, she nodded her head in reply.Huo Yao did not pursue the topic any further and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go to my room now.\u201d***After she went back to her bedroom, Huo Yao stared at the laptop on her desk for a few seconds. Then, she moved her fingers nimbly and turned it on.The laptop was brand new. Nothing was on the desktop, which meant there were no messy software installs.Huo Yao opened a website and typed a string of English words in the search column and pressed \u2018Enter\u2019.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Huo Yao typed in some words and passed the verification process. It was something which she was fairly familiar with. Only now did she get the actual access to the website.Before she could read the page, the screen dimmed at once and a log-in dialog box came up.Huo Yao stared at the computer screen emotionlessly and typed in her account name and password while shaking her head.This crabby website was just as troublesome as before. Its doom must be inevitable.1Soon, a ding sound informed her that the log-in was successful. A row of glowing words in a big font, at the top of the webpage, caught her attention.[At the Cloud Realm, you can buy anything that you can think of.]Huo Yao had so many things which she wanted to hurl at this slogan.Her lips twitched.She scrolled through the page but did not see anything interesting, not even any controversial posts. Bored, she was about to close the page.Right then, the profile photo of her alt account suddenly began to blink.Someone was looking for her.Huo Yao raised her eyebrows and clicked on the profile photo. Instantly, a message popped up. At the right hand corner of that person\u2019s profile photo, there was a little green dot, which meant that this person was currently online.Cool Autumn: [OMG, dude, finally!]Cool Autumn: [Where have you been during the whole of last year? I haven\u2019t seen you here in a long time.]Cool Autumn: [Bro, are you there? Why aren\u2019t you saying something?]Huo Yao stared at her screen for a long time before she slowly typed in a punctuation mark.Bold Little Darling:[?]When she registered for this account initially, the nickname was generated randomly and she didn\u2019t bother changing it at that time. However, later on, she found out that this shabby website did not have the function of altering the screen name. Therefore, she was stuck with this stupid nickname.1Cool Autumn: [Bro, where have you been? You were gone for a year.]1Huo Yao was thinking about how to reply to this question. A while later, she typed \u2014Bold Little Darling: [Have you tried transmigrating?]1Liang Qiu, whom Huo Yao was chatting with, had just sipped some water in. When he saw this answer pop up on his computer screen, water splashed out of his mouth.Cool Autumn: [No way. Bro, did someone hack your account? What kind of an idiotic question is this?]Bold Little Darling: [Piss off!]Same old short temper from the same old Bold Little Darling.Cool Autumn: [Sorry. I was joking.]Bold Little Darling: [I am logging off now.]Cool Autumn: [Wait. Hold your horses. I want to ask you about someone.]Bold Little Darling: [Who?]Cool Autumn: [Shangguan Yu.]Huo Yao looked at the name with an odd expression on her face. For a long time, she didn\u2019t type anything in reply.1Liang Qiu waited for a long moment without seeing an answer, so he sent another message.Cool Autumn: [?? Are you still there?]Huo Yao blinked and began to type her answer: [I don\u2019t know him. Why are you looking for him?]Cool Autumn: [I am asking on behalf of a friend. I think I should buy some medicine from him. I heard that Shangguan Yu is a mystery man, and maybe you would know him.]1Bold Little Darling: [Nope. Logging off.]Cool Autumn: [Fine. Dude, can you give me your contact information if that\u2019s okay with you? You know, we\u2019ve known each other for three years now.]2Bold Little Darling: [Not okay with me. Bye.]Huo Yao switched off the computer.The profile photo of his friend \u2018Bold Little Darling\u2019 turned grey immediately. Liang Qiu scratched his head, speechlessly.This bold due was still so sternly detached, and unmoved!Liang Qiu turned off the webpage. A few seconds later, he grabbed the phone on his desk and sent out a text message.**It had been a few days now since Huo Yao returned to the Huo Family. Since then, apart from her early morning jog, she stayed at home all the time. Song Ning wanted to take her out shopping several times, but she refused, saying that she had to study.This troubled Song Ning deeply.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The box was not particularly large, but it was heavy. Huo Jinyan had to exert all his might and even ask his wife for help, just to move the box from the door till the living room.Song Ning made fun of her panting husband and said, \u201cRemember to take the invigorator which Yaoyao gave you.\u201dVeins were popping on Huo Jinyan\u2019s forehead due to exertion. He was so tired that he did not want to utter any response to his wife\u2019s teasing.Huo Yao came downstairs at that time to get some water and saw the box in the living room.\u201cDear, your package has arrived.\u201d Song Ning shouted to her.Huo Yao put down her cup and walked over.\u201cWhat did your friend send you? It is quite heavy.\u201d Song Ning was curious to know.Huo Yao lowered her eyes and pulled her sleeves up.With a shrug of her shoulders, she said, \u201cJust some random things.\u201dWhile answering her, Huo Yao had already picked up the box. It seemed that her slender body contained unlimited strength.\u201cI am going back upstairs.\u201dFrom her voice, her parents could tell that she was not affected by the heaviness at all.On the other hand, just a little while ago, Huo Jinyan had to make a strenuous effort in lifting the same box. He was in shock.\u201c!!!\u201dWas his daughter Hercules?That box weighed easily over a dozen kilos. How could she lift it up with so much ease? She didn\u2019t seem to have exerted any effort at all!Song Ning was just as astonished. Looking at her slender build, she had always assumed her daughter to be an adorable, delicate, and gentle girl. At this moment, that image was collapsing in her mind.Huo Yao had no idea that her casual act of picking up the box had left an indelible mark on her mom and dad\u2019s hearts.Before she transmigrated to this body, she had been extremely strong. Just after the transmigration, this body was very weak. However, after a year\u2019s training and adjustments, this body was now even better than her old body.Though this box weighed about 20 kilos, carrying it was a piece of cake for her.She placed the box in her bedroom. Post that, Huo Yao spent the entire afternoon cooped up in the room without stepping out for even a moment.Song Ning came to her door several times and wanted to knock at her door. But every time, she gave up.Huo Yao came down at dinner time. The look on her delicate face indicated that she was tired.Today, her big brother, Huo Yanxi had come home, which surprised Huo Yao. During the past few days, she had only met him once when he went to pick her up at the airport. He had not returned even once, since then.Huo Yao wondered if he was too occupied or simply didn\u2019t want to accept her as his younger sister.Of course, Huo Yao did not care whether he would accept her or not.Everyone was seated at the dinner table.\u201cSister, I heard from mom that you are transferring to No.1 Middle School?\u201d This seemed to be a troubling subject for Huo Yanxi.That day, on their way home, she had mentioned that she was going to attend No.1 Middle School. At the time, he thought that she was merely bragging, and had despised her because of that. Therefore, after he dropped Lu Xia at her home, he didn\u2019t come back to the house.His mom had called him several times ever since then, else, he wouldn\u2019t come back today as well.God knows how stunned he was when his mom showed him the Acceptance Letter from the school.Huo Yan always kept quiet when she was dining. After a long while, she raised her head slowly and looked at Huo Yanxi with her clear eyes.She said, \u201cWell\u2026 yes. I am going there tomorrow to register.\u201dHuo Yanxi looked into his sister\u2019s pure and clear eyes. Somehow, he felt conflicted. After a moment, he mumbled. \u201cLet me\u2026 give you a ride to school tomorrow.\u201d\u201cAh, thank you but no need. I can take a cab. You have to go to work.\u201d Huo Yao thought that her answer was impeccably polite.But her words upset Huo Yanxi even more.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hence, he insisted on giving her a ride.Huo Yao had finished her meal. She put down her chopsticks and looked at Huo Yanxi. She was about to say \u2018yes\u2019 when he added the following words.\u201cXiaxia is studying in No.1 Middle School as well. I promised her that I would give her a ride on the first day of school. You are not familiar with the school, yet. With the help of Xiaxia\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish, Huo Yao cut him off and spoke the next set of words, coldly, \u201cNo thanks. I can take care of myself.\u201dHer words were followed by a cynical smile.Then, she stood up and said to Song Ning and Huo Jinyan, \u201cMom, dad, I\u2019ll go to my room now.\u201dHaving said that, she left even before her parents nodded their approval.Huo Yanxi came back to his senses with a frown. Was Huo Yao throwing a tantrum because he mentioned that he was going to drive Xiaxia to school?He said to his parents in an annoyed manner, \u201cHas she been behaving like this since she came home?\u201dHe felt really stupid that he had felt sorry for her, momentarily.Song Ning gazed at her son. She understood why he was asking this. But instinctively, Song Ning defended her daughter.\u201cYaoyao is a good girl. You are her big brother. You knew that she had just returned but you didn\u2019t come to see her in such a long time. I believe she is not happy about that.\u201dHuo Yanxi knew he was somewhat in the wrong. Still, he added in a firm voice.\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t speak to us in this way even if she is unhappy. Mom, she has just returned to the family, for sure, but don\u2019t overindulge her.\u201dSong Ning was offended by her son\u2019s words. She slapped her palm on the table, angrily.\u201cFirst you tell me. Why do you dislike your sister so much? What did she ever do to you?\u201dSince his mom was about to lose her temper, Huo Yanxi stood up at once. He waved his hand and gave her a perfunctory answer.\u201cAlright, fine. This is my mistake. I shouldn\u2019t have come back tonight. Bye.\u201dNot long afterward, the front door was banged shut.Song Ning stared at the plates on the table with a troubled gaze. None of them had eaten much. \u201cI thought Huo Yanxi got along with her on the day he picked her up.\u201dWhat was with the abnormal behavior today?Huo Jinyan patted her shoulder to comfort her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Our daughter has just come back. They need some time to get familiar with each other.\u201d\u201cI just think that Yanxi has the most stable personality out of the four of them and he should be able to get along well with Yaoyao. But just now\u2026\u201d Song Ning rubbed her temple.Her migraine was coming back.Her second, third, and fourth sons had not come back yet and they were the truly weird ones. God knows what kind of conflicts would happen when they come back.**After Huo Yanxi drove away from the neighborhood, he spent a lot of time thinking. Eventually, he called Lu Xia and asked her to meet him at a western-style restaurant near her home.Half an hour later.\u201cBrother, it is so late at night. Is something wrong?\u201dEver since Lu Xia participated in the \u2018Star Training Camp\u2019, she had earned countless fans and a little bit of fame. Now, whenever she went out, she would wear sunglasses and a mask. After she entered the private room, she took them off.Huo Yanxi poured her some water. \u201cNo hurry. Let\u2019s grab a bite first.\u201dHe handed over the menu to Lu Xia.Lu Xia ordered a steak for herself and settled back in her seat. She sipped some water and decided to sound him out.\u201cHave you come to see me because of Yaoyao\u2019s school transfer?\u201dLast time, on their way back from the airport, she had mentioned about helping Huo Yao find a school. However, several days passed but no one from the Huo Family had called her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Looking at Lu Xia, he forced a smile out. \u201cYou could say so.\u201dLu Xia started to show a lot of concern. \u201cHas she not decided upon the school yet? If so, let me give a call to my dad now\u2026\u201dShe grabbed her phone from her purse. Lu Xia was about to dial the number but paused in confusion as Huo Yanxi\u2019s next set of words stopped her.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to make the call. It\u2019s not that she hasn\u2019t decided yet.\u201dHuo Yanxi curled his lips in dissatisfaction. After keeping quiet for about two seconds, he went on. \u201cShe has chosen a school already, No.1 Middle School.\u201d7Lu Xia was stunned into silence. After she collected herself, she asked him again, as if to check if she had heard wrong the first time. \u201cDid you say No.1 Middle School? The one that I go to?\u201dHer voice conveyed her disbelief and some other complicated emotions.Judging by the look on her face, Huo Yanxi knew that she was finding it difficult to digest this fact as well. \u201cShe will be going to the school tomorrow to register. I bothered you so late at night because I wanted to ask you to look after her at school.\u201dHe explained the reason for his visit to her, finally.He paused for a bit and then continued speaking, \u201cYaoyao grew up in a remote county city, and has never seen the world. We are not exactly sure about her grades but she possibly cannot have what it takes to get into No.1 Middle School.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how she got that Acceptance Letter, but she insists upon attending this school only. So, Xiaxia, I can only turn to you for help.\u201dHuo Yanxi was unhappy about Huo Yao\u2019s behaviour. That being said, at the end of the day, they were one family. He had to help her in whatever way he could.9Lu Xia lowered her eyelids, trying to hide her real emotions. Two seconds later, when she looked at Huo Yanxi again, she had already put on a sweet smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I would have taken good care of Yaoyao even if you didn\u2019t ask me to.\u201d2Huo Yanxi knew that Lu Xia was a kind girl. He fixed his gaze on her, feeling sorry. How wonderful it would have been if it was she who belonged to the Huo Family.23\u201cUmm, did you say that you don\u2019t know how Yaoyao got that Acceptance Letter?\u201d Lu Xia feigned confusion to probe deeper into the matter.Huo Yanxi nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Mom and dad don\u2019t know, either.\u201d\u201cOh, I see\u2026\u201d Lu Xia rubbed the edge of her phone.Suddenly, she mentioned something, hesitating, \u201cI remember that night. It was last month. I thought I heard my dad calling the principal of No.1 Middle School.\u201d1Huo Yanxi was visibly stunned. Last month? Wasn\u2019t that close to the date printed on his sister\u2019s Acceptance Letter?But, soon after, Huo Yanxi suddenly realised that Huo Yao grew up with her grandma in the county instead of the Lu Family. She was not well received by the Lu Family. Would the Lu Family find such an outstanding school for her under such circumstances?Somehow, he could not bring himself to believe this.1Lu Xia immediately noticed the change in Huo Yanxi\u2019s expressions. When he began to frown, she jumped in before he could say something. \u201cBut, No.1 Middle School has strict rules in every aspect. My dad can pull some strings but to get her in would still be difficult\u2026 So, I might have heard it wrong.\u201d5Saying so, Lu Xia stuck her tongue out. She looked perfectly innocent when she said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. As long as she obtained this Acceptance Letter through the normal way, whoever helped her does not matter. The person did this for Yaoyao\u2019s benefit.\u201dHuo Yanxi\u2019s eyebrows knitted even tighter in annoyance when he heard this.Lu Xia darted a glance at Huo Yanxi who was not saying anything in response. She, too, did not utter another word, wisely.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My dad has asked me several times to invite you over.\u201dHuo Yanxi rested his hands on the steering wheel. He cast a glance at the Lu Family\u2019s villa and shook his head. \u201cNo, thank you. It is late for me to go in tonight. Can I take a rain check?\u201dLu Xia was disappointed, but she hid that in the depth of her eyes. Maintaining her signature smile on her face, she said easily, \u201cOf course. Drive safely. Goodbye.\u201dShe stopped for a second and pretended that she had just remembered something right now. She winked at Huo Yanxi, and said in a pouting tone, \u201cDon\u2019t forget what you promised me in the past.\u201dHuo Yanxi was confused for a moment.\u201cYou told me that you would drive me to school when the semester begins. Did you forget it already?\u201d Lu Xia put her hands over her chest to show that she was hurting.Huo Yanxi understood her meaning and broke into laughter, while shaking his head. \u201cNo, I have not forgotten about that.\u201dLu Xia\u2019s smile came back. \u201cGood. Now, go home. See you tomorrow!\u201dLu Xia pushed the door open and was about to get off. Suddenly, Huo Yao\u2019s figure leapt into Huo Yanxi\u2019s mind again. Almost subconsciously, he stopped Lu Xia. \u201cXiaxia.\u201dLu Xia turned around and gazed at him, a bit of worry visible in her eyes. \u201cYes?\u201dThis girl had beautiful eyes, and her delicate face was breathtaking. She was a cute and thoughtful young lady.6Huo Yanxi stared at her. All of a sudden, he smiled and shook his head. \u201cNothing. I just forgot the time that I should pick you up at.\u201d1Lu Xia heaved a long sigh and replied jokingly. \u201cYou scared me. I almost thought you were going to go back on your word and say that you wouldn\u2019t drive me tomorrow.\u201dHuo Yanxi denied it in a flat voice. \u201cNope.\u201d\u201cOkay. Pick me up at eight.\u201d Lu Xia knew that this was the right time to end the conversation.Huo Yanxi nodded.Then, Lu Xia waved him goodbye, and stepped into the villa. Huo Yanxi kept gazing at the gate long after she had gone inside.Since his biological sister did not need a ride from him, he didn\u2019t have to turn down Xiaxia for her sake. After all, Xiaxia was his sister as well.With this thought, the remaining part of his guilt vanished.14Soon, he started the car and drove away from the Lu Family villa.*When Lu Xia went inside, her mom, He Xiaoman was sitting on the sofa in the living room. \u201cIt is so late. Did some friends ask you out?\u201d She asked Lu Xia with warmth in her voice.Her voice was gentle and in no way, was she blaming Lu Xia.Lu Xia went close to her and began to rub He Xiaoman\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMy big brother wanted to ask me for something.\u201d\u201cBig brother?\u201d Upon hearing these words, He Xiaoman frowned.\u201cIs it your foster family again?\u201dLu Xia knew that He Xiaoman had always been holding the Huo Family in contempt, so she merely said, \u201chmm\u201d.He Xiaoman turned around to speak to her daughter in a sincere and earnest manner, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you not to see the Huo Family so often? I know that you are a kind girl. But your foster family is not good, especially your fake brothers. Don\u2019t get so attached to them. They may take advantage of you, someday.\u201dLu Xia lowered her eyes.In her heart, she sneered. \u201cYou think that because you are prejudiced and shortsighted. You have no idea what they are capable of.\u201d3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be okay.\u201dCouple of seconds later, she asked her a question. \u201cThere is something that I find strange, Mom. Didn\u2019t you say that Yaoyao is poor in studies?\u201dHe Xiaoman was enjoying her daughter\u2019s massage with her eyes closed. She only answered after a moment. \u201cYes. What about it?\u201dLu Xia kept kneading her shoulders while she said, \u201cI think she is going to join No.1 Middle School.\u201dHe Xiaoman opened her eyes all of a sudden with an astonished look on her face. She leaned sideways and craned her neck to look at Lu Xia who was standing behind her. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dHe Xiaoman was genuinely in shock.Looking at her reaction, a glint of suspicion arose in Lu Xia\u2019s eyes. \u201cHuo Yanxi came to me tonight and told me that Huo Yao would be attending No.1 Middle School. He asked me to look after her at school.\u201dLu Xia blinked and couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cMom, did you and dad pull some strings on her behalf? How else could she get into No.1 Middle School?\u201dHe Xiaoman sneered and replied. \u201cNo way! Given her grades, not even the mediocre schools would accept her, let alone No.1 Middle School. Why would your dad and I pull any strings for her. She is not a part of this family.\u201d\u201cSo you were not the ones who helped her. Then how did she get into No.1 Middle School\u2026\u201d Lu Xia was even more curious now.He Xiaoman pulled a long face and lowered her voice, subconsciously. \u201cAre you sure about this?\u201dLu Xia nodded. \u201cAbsolutely sure. Huo Yanxi told me himself. He didn\u2019t have any reason to lie to me.\u201dHe Xiaoman sat up straight. After a moment of contemplation, she grabbed her phone from the table.*Huo Yao was fiddling with some ancient-looking vessels. All of a sudden, her phone began to ring. She stopped what she was doing and looked at the handset, lying on the bed. But after a moment, she ignored it and went back to her work.After the first call, the caller was unwilling to give up. Her phone kept ringing incessantly.But Huo Yao was not distracted by the noise. She was fully absorbed in her work. Soon, she channeled the extraction from the utensil into a ceramic bottle. Soon after, she removed her gloves with care.Her phone was still ringing, only this time, Huo Yao did not turn a deaf ear to it. She walked to the bed and grabbed it. When she saw the caller ID, she was visibly surprised.She swiped her finger on the screen, and the call was connected. The first thing she heard was He Xiaoman\u2019s utterly annoying voice. \u201cWhat took you so long? I have called you like a thousand times already.\u201dHuo Yao moved her phone a bit away from her ear. She did not care much for her foster mother\u2019s accusing voice. \u201cWhat is it?\u201dOn the other side of the phone, He Xiaoman\u2019s expressions became awful. \u201cWhat is with your tone?\u201dHuo Yao rubbed her forehead with impatience. She had no time for He Xiaoman\u2019s nagging. In a cold voice, she threatened. \u201cI\u2019ll hang up if you have nothing else to say.\u201dHe Xiaoman knew that this ex-daughter of hers had changed drastically in terms of her personality during the past year. She had become really rebellious. It felt as if she were not the same person. Therefore, He Xiaoman did not scold her any further.\u201cI don\u2019t know what you did for you to get into No.1 Middle School. But listen to me carefully. I don\u2019t want to see you at that School. Your existence in that place will be a joke for the No.1 Middle School and the Lu Family.\u201d\u201cApart from that institute, you can choose any other middle school in the city. We can pull some strings to get you in. Moreover, we can even pay your tuition fee. However, you are not supposed to tell anyone that you were once a part of the Lu Family!\u201d1These words intrigued Huo Yao and she asked in all earnestness. \u201cIs the Lu Family the richest in the world?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She threw herself onto the comfort of her bed and stared at the ceiling.She turned her voice softer and irked her foster mother a bit more. \u201cSince the Lu Family is not the wealthiest in the world, who gave you the courage to brag about it?\u201dWhy couldn\u2019t people have a little more integrity?Huo Yao heaved a sigh and hung up.He Xiaoman was quaking with rage when the call was disconnected. She threw the phone on the side table. With a loud noise, the phone clattered to the ground.Lu Xia, who was standing besides her, trembled as if she was scared. She picked up the phone from the ground, gingerly and put it back on the table. The screen was broken.Lu Xia sat down next to He Xiaoman and patted her shoulder, gently. \u201cMom, don\u2019t be upset. Don\u2019t lower yourself to the same level as hers. She grew up in grandma\u2019s house and has always been a wild kid. It\u2019s no surprise that she would say such harsh words. Don\u2019t take them to heart. It\u2019s not worth getting angry because of her.\u201d1He Xiaoman had turned on the speaker while talking so Lu Xia heard everything that Huo Yao said.To be honest, she was surprised that Huo Yao would adopt such an attitude. Her voice had sounded normal but Lu Xia picked up traces of overwhelming arrogance in her tone.He Xiaoman was a person full of self-pride. No wonder she would be upset after Huo Yao dissed her.Lu Xia continued to comfort her. After a long time, He Xiaoman finally calmed down. She looked at her cute and polite biological daughter and patted her head. \u201cYou are such a sweet girl.\u201d4Once again, He Xiaoman felt lucky that her biological daughter had returned to her. If she had continued living her life with her foster daughter, she would have died of anger sooner or later.1He Xiaoman took a deep breath and finally remembered the reason for staying up so late tonight. She turned and took out a card from the purse which was kept next to her.She said, \u201cThe new semester is about to begin. This card has half a million in it. Take this and let me know if you want more.\u201dLu Xia handed the card back to her immediately. \u201cMom, I have enough money with me. You already gave me some.\u201dHe Xiaoman did not allow Lu Xia to refuse and stuffed the card back in her hand. \u201cYou are a member of the Lu Family. I cannot let people think you are stingy. Besides, you are in the Stars Training Camp. You have gained so much popularity. I must help you keep up your appearance.\u201dLu Xia looked at the card and then at her mother. \u201cThank you, Mom.\u201d She said, happily.*After Huo Yao hung up the call, she was ready to take a shower and turn in. She had just taken out her pajamas when she heard a knock on the door.She heard Song Ning\u2019s gentle voice.\u201dYaoyao, are you still up?\u201dHuo Yao put her pajama down and went to open the door.Song Ning gazed at her calm and adorable daughter and her eldest son\u2019s behavior came back to her mind.Looking at her face, Song Ning asked, carefully. \u201cAre you upset about your big brother?\u201dHuo Yao was confused. \u201cWhat?Song Ning was relieved that Huo Yao didn\u2019t understand the question. It meant that she didn\u2019t seem to mind what had happened tonight. But, at the same time, Song Ning felt even more frustrated.She comforted Huo Yao by saying, \u201cYour brother can be really careless sometimes. He neglected your feelings. Yaoyao, don\u2019t mind him.\u201dHuo Yao finally understood what Song Ning was referring to. \u201cI know. I am not mad at him.\u201dHer answer was concise and comprehensive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Song Ning could tell right away that Huo Yao was not saying those words against her will or just as a formality.Her daughter was so sensible. Out of instinct, Song Ning hurled a ton of curses at her son in her heart. What was wrong with his eyes? How dare he say that his baby sister had a bad temper!1\u201cEh-hem. I am glad that you are not mad. Your dad said that he would drive you to school tomorrow. You can sleep in a bit longer in the morning.\u201d Song Ning added.\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cGood. Have some rest. Don\u2019t stay up too late. Good night.\u201d Song Ning turned around, ready to go.\u201cMom, wait up.\u201d Huo Yao stopped all of a sudden and then hurried into her bedroom.Soon, Huo Yao came back to the door and gave Song Ning a ceramic bottle. \u201cOne pellet every three days, oral administration. Your migraine problem will be cured in a month.\u201dSong Ning took the ceramic bottle from her daughter\u2019s hand automatically but her mind was blank. \u201cIs this\u2026 from your friend?\u201dShe remembered what her daughter had said earlier and the package which she received today.Huo Yao mumbled vaguely, making it sound like an affirmative reply.Song Ning held the bottle and stood there for a bit. Then she smiled and said, \u201cThank your friend on my behalf. This is a very kind gesture.\u201dLast time, the pellet which her daughter gave her, was really effective. That being said\u2026 she never thought that it was possible to have her health issue cured, once and for all.Nevertheless, she was happy about her daughter\u2019s kind heart.1Huo Yao could tell that Song Ning did not believe her completely. But she did not say anything and just replied with a smile.***The next morning.Huo Yao went downstairs. She was wearing a casual top and a pair of pants. Her hair was combed into a ponytail. She had teamed the look with a cross-body canvas bag. Though it was a simple outfit, thanks to her gorgeous face, she looked quite cool and eye-catching in this plain get-up.Song Ning exclaimed to herself about her daughter\u2019s good looks. Other people had to pick pretty clothes to make themselves look good. As for her daughter, she could bring out the best in all kinds of outfits. Whatever she was wearing, she would look impeccable.Still \u2014Song Ning crossed her hands over her chest. \u201cYaoyao, why didn\u2019t you wear the clothes which I got you? Do you not like them?\u201dAll of a sudden, she felt the clothes she picked out were beneath her daughter.In case she would repeat and say, \u201cI can get you a new batch if you don\u2019t like them,\u201d indicating that the family was wealthy, Huo Yao put her hand up immediately.She explained in a hurried tone. \u201cI am just used to wearing pants. Besides, I\u2019ll have to change into my school uniform once I reach school.\u201dSong Ning answered. \u201cOf course. It was my mistake. I will have people get you some pants.\u201dShe must prepare clothes in various styles to suit her daughter!Huo Yao, \u201c\u2026\u201dHuo Jinyan was reading the newspaper. He put it down, and picked up the card which he had prepared.He looked at Huo Yao and said, \u201cMy dear girl, I didn\u2019t buy you anything since I don\u2019t know what you like. This card is a present for you to celebrate the beginning of the semester. Spend all you want. There is no upper limit.\u201d10Huo Yao\u2019s mouth twitched. She looked at the black card with complicated feelings.Wasn\u2019t the Huo Family supposed to be poor?But here she was being given a black card, one without limits. Moreover, she could spend as much as she wanted. Why did she have a feeling that her family was a hidden rich household?2Huo Jinyan noticed that his daughter was in a daze. He belatedly remembered that she had grown up in a small county. A few seconds later, he stuffed the card into her hands and added. \u201cYou keep the card. The password is your birthday. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t know how to use it, yet. I will go to the bank and withdraw some cash for you!\u201dThe card was forced onto her and he was preparing more cash.Huo Yao, \u201c???\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the elevator, Huo Yao asked him a seemingly random question. \u201cDad, isn\u2019t our family poor?\u201dHuo Jinyan was surprised by this question. He did not know where she learned that the family was poor. Some past events came rushing back to his memory and he heaved a sigh. \u201cOur family is not that rich. But don\u2019t worry, my daughter. I will not let you suffer.\u201d3He had given her a black card and would not stop insisting that she could spend without holding back. His actions did not match with his words. She tilted her head and stared at her father. Evidently, she did not buy his reply.Huo Jinyan was unnerved by her stare. Luckily for him, the elevator dinged and the door opened. He cleared this throat and hurried out of the elevator.Huo Yao smiled and followed him at a sedate pace.**The neighborhood which the Huo Family lived in, was not too far from No.1 Middle School. It was just a twenty minutes\u2019 drive. As a result, Huo Yao did not have to live on campus.Huo Jinyan intended to send her daughter to the Office of Academic Affairs to register in person. However, on the first day of school, there was no parking space available. Huo Yao had to assure him several times that everything would be fine before he was finally willing to leave from there.After Huo Jinyan left, Huo Yao walked to the gate in an unhurried manner.Students and faculties had to swipe their cards to get in. Since she had just been transferred here and was without a student card, the guard stopped her at the gate.Huo Yao took out the Acceptance Letter from her backpack and gave it to the guard. \u201cWill this get me in?\u201dThe guard took it and looked at Huo Yao again. There was a strange expression in his eyes. He called another colleague over and said to Huo Yao, \u201cWait here. I need to go to the Office of Academic Affairs to verify this.\u201dBefore Huo Yao could say anything, the guard left with the Acceptance Letter.As the guard walked away, Huo Yao scrunched her eyes. Why did she have to go to so much trouble just to get into a crappy high school?2Though annoyed, she waited patiently.But that guard had not come back even after 10 minutes passed. Huo Yao felt that she had a lot to complain about the school\u2019s efficiency.\u201cCan you give a call to your colleague?\u201d Huo Yao asked the other guard politely.Those with good looks were usually likable. The guard nodded and made a call. The call went through but no one answered.The guard tried several more times but still, no one answered.He said to Huo Yao apologetically, \u201cI think he forgot to take his phone with him. He is not answering. I\u2019ve tried several times already.\u201dHuo Yao frowned. If that guard didn\u2019t come out, did she have to stand here and wait forever?She looked at her watch and asked again. \u201cDo you have the number of the Office of Academic Affairs or the principal?\u201dThe guard scratched his head embarrassingly. \u201cI am sorry but I am new here. I don\u2019t know any of those numbers. Please wait for a couple more minutes. My colleague will surely come back soon.\u201dFine. Huo Yao was not in the mood to ask this ignorant guard any more questions.Right at this moment, a black sedan pulled up by the gate. The guard hurried over to the side.The window was lowered and the person inside showed something to the guard. Immediately, the guard became respectful.Since Huo Yao\u2019s gaze was fixed elsewhere, she did not notice this. She only looked in the direction of the car after the black sedan honked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After the window of the back seat was lowered, Huo Yao saw someone familiar.Huo Yao was stunned to see him here.Min Yu raised his thick eyebrows and his deep, amorous eyes were glistening.1He asked, with a faint smile. \u201cYou can\u2019t get in?\u201dHuo Yao recovered from her initial shock and shrugged her shoulder as a reply. This couldn\u2019t be more obvious, right?Min Yu chuckled. \u201cCome on. I will take you in.\u201dZhuo Yun could not believe that he was hearing these words from Min Yu.Was this his detached, indifferent master?Huo Yao raised her eyebrows. She glanced at the guard, only to see that he still had his head lowered. It didn\u2019t seem like he was going to stop her. After a bit, Huo Yao decided not to refuse Min Yu\u2019s offer. She pulled open the door of the backseat and got in.Not far from there, Lu Xia just happened to see this. She pointed to the gate in surprise, \u201cYanxi, look. Isn\u2019t that Yaoyao?\u201d1Huo Yanxi had driven Lu Xia to school. But along the way, he had been absent-minded. Listening to Lu Xia\u2019s words, he looked up at once. However, he merely saw a black sedan driving into the campus. There was no sign of Huo Yao.Huo Yanxi felt uncertain and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t see her. Xiaxia, are you sure that it was her?\u201dThough it was a quick glance from a distance, Lu Xia was sure that the person getting into the black sedan was Huo Yao.Two seconds later, Lu Xia looked away and said, \u201cI might be wrong. Xiaoxiao would not go to school in a stranger\u2019s car.\u201d3She whispered her words, so Huo Yanxi didn\u2019t hear the full sentence.He asked. \u201cWhat stranger\u2019s car?\u201dLu Xia wished to speak up but stopped herself on second thoughts. Eventually, she shook her head. \u201cNothing.\u201dAfter a pause, she added softly. \u201cYanxi, thanks to you for the ride today. I have to go now.\u201dHuo Yanxi waved her goodbye with a smile. But the minute Lu Xia went away, the smile on his face vanished.His sister got into a stranger\u2019s car?2**At the same time, Huo Yao was sitting in Min Yu\u2019s car. She turned around and looked at him with her chin resting on her hand. \u201cThis is such a huge coincidence, neighbor boy.\u201dMin Yu\u2019s lips curled upwards upon hearing \u2018neighbor boy\u2019.He was speechless and said the next set of words in his magnetic, beautiful voice, \u201cMy name is Min Yu.\u201d2As he said those words, he was sure that the car swerved for an instant.Min Yu darted a quick look towards Zhuo Yun, who was driving.Feeling the chills, Zhuo Yun sat up straighter. He was afraid to look back.Huo Yao did not notice what was happening between the two. She was still wearing that lazy look on her delicate face.She murmured softly. \u201cMin Yu\u2026 a pretty name.\u201dMin Yu changed his position and crossed his legs. \u201cWhat about the person? Am I not good looking?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know that you became so brazen only within a couple of days.\u201d Huo Yao glared at him.Min Yu laughed but changed the conversation to another topic. \u201cWhat happened at the gate?\u201dShe sighed and said, \u201cI was not allowed in because I don\u2019t have the student ID card yet.\u201dHuo Yao shrugged and posed a question back at him, curiously. \u201cHow about you? Why are you at No.1 Middle School? You can drive your car onto campus, directly. Don\u2019t tell me you are a teacher here.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They had known each other for nearly a year but the number of their interactions was quite limited. She didn\u2019t know what he did for a living. In fact, this was the first time that she had learnt his name and only because he brought it up himself.Min Yu tilted his head. \u201cDo you think I look like one?\u201dHuo Yao sized him up and down and shook her head, critically. Post that, she said, \u201cNope.\u201dNo school would hire a teacher like him unless the school\u2019s intention was to have students\u2019 minds distracted from their studies.1Min Yu smiled faintly. \u201cIndeed, I am not a teacher.\u201dIn a sense, she was right.Huo Yao turned her face and looked outside the car\u2019s window. She was not in the mood to ask any more questions. \u201cPlease pull over and drop me on the side. I can walk to the admissions office from here.\u201dZhuo Yun slowed the car down but did not pull over. He was looking at Min Yu through the rear view mirror.\u201cOkay.\u201d Min Yu gave his consent.Only then did Zhuo Yu gently apply the brakes.Huo Yao threw a look at Zhuo Yun. The interaction between these two was interesting. After she said thanks to both of them, she stepped out of the car.Zhuo Yun did not re-start the car immediately. and watched as the girl walked further and further away from them.After that, he asked in a low voice. \u201cYu, is she the girl whom you asked us to look up? Huo Yao?\u201dMin Yu gave a brief answer. \u201cYes.\u201dHis detached and indifferent expression had been restored on his face. He was tapping his index finger on his knee, unconsciously.\u201cShe is pretty but I didn\u2019t notice anything special about her.\u201d Zhuo Yun commented in an off-hand manner.He could not figure out why his master was so into this high school girl. If his family found out, it would cause a major stir.Min Yu gazed at her receding back and replied with a faint smile on his face. \u201cPrettiness in itself, is a special strait.\u201d1Zhuo Yun could not help but refute by saying, \u201cThere are so many beautiful young ladies from wealthy families in the capital. I have never seen you ever paying so much attention to any of them.\u201d\u201cSo superficial.\u201d Min Yu sneered.1Every expression on his handsome face was saying that he despised Zhuo Yun\u2019s remark.Zhuo Yun, \u201c\u2026\u201dThis was hypocrisy! Double standard!Zhuo Yun shook his head and steered the conversation away from Huo Yao.His tone had turned serious now. \u201cYu, there\u2019s another update. The agent still hasn\u2019t managed to trace Shangguan Yu. Do you think\u2026 that there is no such person, to begin with?\u201d5Cloud Realm was a platform that had access to all the top-level information chains around the globe. If no concrete information could be found about Shangguan Yu on Cloud Realm, naturally, Zhuo Yun would think so.1Min Yu pressed his thin lips together. \u201cAre you saying that the medicines concocted according to ancient prescriptions are fake as well?\u201dZhuo Yun was also distressed about this matter. \u201cBut we have been searching for over a year now\u2026\u201d1\u201cThen let\u2019s search for another year.\u201d Min Yu sounded casual but Zhuo Yun could tell that he was also feeling impatient.Zhuo Yun looked at him through the rearview mirror and nodded his head.**After Huo Yao got out of the car, she asked someone for directions to the Office of Academic Affairs. Not long afterward, she reached her destination.She knocked on the door and entered only after the person inside gave her the permission to do so.There was only one teacher in the office. He was in his late thirties and was busy writing something down.Huo Yao went to him and used simple words to explain why she was here.Surprised, Wei Mingzhe put his pen down. \u201cAre you the person who passed the online test with a perfect score from Fuxian County? Are you Huo Yao?\u201dHuo Yao adjusted her backpack and raised her eyebrows in a haughty way. \u201cYes, I am.\u201dWei Mingzhe evaluated the girl with his gaze. Her demeanour revealed her pride and arrogance.His initial thoughts were hidden under his gaze. He believed that kids from small, remote counties were really full of themselves and didn\u2019t know what modesty was.\u201d1He shook his head and said, \u201cGive me your Acceptance Letter.\u201d2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sir, didn\u2019t you receive the letter from him?\u201dWei Mingzhe frowned. \u201cNo. I have been in my office all this time but I didn\u2019t see any security guard stopping by. The Acceptance Letter is an important document. How could you just give it to a security guard?\u201dHuo Yao\u2019s eyes dimmed. All of a sudden, she remembered the odd expression on that guard\u2019s face when he saw her Acceptance Letter. Back then, she hadn\u2019t thought much of it. But now, she suspected that the guard was waiting for her on purpose to take her document away.\u201cOnly with the Acceptance Letter, can you enroll in No.1 Middle School. Without it, you will have to find another school.\u201d Wei Mingzhe was not exaggerating or trying to scare her.1This was one of the rules of the school.\u201cNot even with the copy which the school keeps in their file?\u201d1Wei Mingzhe shook his head in negative.\u201cOkay, got it.\u201d Huo Yao left from there right away.Wei Mingzhe was startled that Huo Yao would leave so readily. Before he even formed his thoughts, she had already stepped out of his office. He opened his mouth but eventually, no words came out.She was just a conceited student. Not accepting her was not such a bad thing.A few minutes later, the Dean hurried into the admissions office. \u201cWei, did a girl named Huo Yao come to register today?\u201dHe provided additional information a beat later. \u201cA senior student is transferring here.\u201dWei Mingzhe did not know why the Dean would appear to be so worried. He said calmly, \u201cShe did come but has already left.\u201dWei Mingzhe did not try to hide the information.The Dean immediately relaxed because he thought that Wei Mingzhe had assigned a class to the girl already. \u201cAlright, I am glad she is taken care of. I have other things to attend to. See you later.\u201dWei Mingzhe was completely baffled by Dean\u2019s harrowed arrival and hasty retreat. It was then that he realized that the man had misunderstood him. Wei Mingzhe stopped the Dean at once. \u201cNo, sir, Huo Yao came here. But I think she forgot to bring her Acceptance Letter. She has already left.\u201dThe Dean spun around immediately. \u201cWhat did you say? She left? How could you let that happen?\u201dWei Mingzhe could not understand why the Dean would pay so much attention to a mere transfer student.After a few seconds of hesitation, Wei Mingzhe reported to the Dean what Huo Yao had said when she came in. He didn\u2019t hide the matter related to the security guard, either.The Dean stomped his feet, burning with a frenzy of rage. \u201cWei, you are so inflexible. Do you know that she is the Principal\u2019s\u2026 Never mind. I have to find her.\u201d4Wei Mingzhe watched as the guy left in a hurry. He was still pondering over the words which the other man left unsaid.The Principal\u2019s what?Relative?Did that mean that the transfer student had not got a \u2018perfect score\u2019, but was instead a relative of the Principal?The more Wei Mingzhe thought about it, the more convinced he was of this. Otherwise, that girl wouldn\u2019t have been so full of herself and the Dean wouldn\u2019t have been so nervous.Right then, Wei Minghe began to think badly of Huo Yao.1He hated students who got into the school by pulling strings instead of using their ability.1**After Huo Yao left the Office of Academic Affairs, she didn\u2019t go to look for the guard. After all, someone had deliberately meant to take away her Acceptance Letter. That guard might have destroyed the letter already. He could insist that he did not take it in the first place and then it would be her words against his.Hence, Huo Yao decided to go directly to the Principal\u2019s office.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No one answered even when she knocked on the door.The Principal must be away.Frustrated, Huo Yao heaved a sigh. \u201cWhy is it so hard just to enroll in a crappy high school?\u201dAll of a sudden, she missed the olden days when she didn\u2019t have to go to school.Damn the transmigration!Huo Yao left from there, unhappy and disgruntled and happened to meet a female teacher on her way. The female teacher pulled a long face when she saw Huo Yao and her voice was mean. \u201cHey, the class is about to begin. What are you still doing here?\u201dHuo Yao halted and blinked innocently. \u201cMa\u2019am, I am a transfer student. I am here to ask which class I am assigned to.\u201dThe teacher\u2019s anger dissipated. \u201cYou should register at the Office of Academic Affairs. This is the Principal\u2019s office. He is busy and does not have time for this.\u201dWith that, the teacher hurried inside the Principal\u2019s office. She didn\u2019t knock on the door. By swiping her card, she was allowed in.Not long afterward, the same teacher came out with a file in her hand. She was surprised to see Huo Yao still standing here. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you left? Didn\u2019t I tell you to go to the Office of Academic Affairs?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cNever mind. Come with me. The office is on my way.\u201d She shook her head and strode ahead leaving Huo Yao no choice but to follow her.After many twists and turns, Huo Yao was back at the Office of Academic Affairs.\u201cMr. Wei, look up information about this transfer student. See which class she should be in. The class is about to begin. Don\u2019t hold her up.\u201d Before Wei Mingzhe could say anything, the teacher spoke up hastily.In the office, Wei Mingzhe and Huo Yao gazed at each other in speechless dismay.Wei Mingzhe didn\u2019t feel like seeing this student who had gotten into the school by using backhand methods. However, because of the Dean\u2019s attitude, Wei Mingzhe decided to ignore his dissatisfaction. With a clouded face, he went to his desk, picked up the landline, and dialed a number.Everything about Wei Mingzhe\u2019s body language indicated that he was upset, which came as a surprise to Huo Yao. She remembered the first time when she walked in, he had been kind to her. What happened during this time?Were all the teachers at No.1 Middle School quick at changing face without reason?Having finished his call, Wei Mingzhe sat down behind his desk. Post that, he said coldly, \u201cStand over there and wait.\u201dHe didn\u2019t even bother to look at Huo Yao.Soon, the Dean who had gone to look for Huo Yao, came in. When he cast his sight on Huo Yao, he felt that he could finally breathe.\u201cHuo Yao, welcome to No.1 Middle School.\u201dHuo Yao nodded politely to him. After pausing for two seconds, she began to explain her trouble. \u201cA security guard took away my Acceptance Letter. Can I still register?\u201dThe Dean answered right away. \u201cIt is okay. The Acceptance Letter is just a formality and it will not affect your registration. I will send someone to ask the guard about this matter.\u201dHuo Yao darted a casual glance at Wei Mingzhe. She breathed in relief and said in a sweet voice, \u201cThat will be really helpful. Thank you.\u201dFeeling Huo Yao\u2019s glance, Wei Mingzhe felt that he had shot himself with his own words.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe Dean failed to notice the weird vibe between Huo Yao and Wei Mingzhe and turned to address Wei Mingzhe. \u201cMr. Wei, I am going to assign Miss Huo to your class. You must take good care of her!\u201d2Those words left Wei Mingzhe astonished and upset!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was ready to accept the fact that a student had enrolled by exploiting a personal connection. But why did the Dean have to make it worse by assigning this student to his class?Keeping Huo Yao\u2019s grades aside, every student of Wei Mingzhe\u2019s Rocket Class was an elite. The senior year was the most crucial year in a student\u2019s academic life. If the parents found out that a student got into his class by taking advantage of some connections, the parents would create a huge scene.Hence, even at the risk of offending the Dean, Wei Mingzhe refused this immediately.\u201cSir, I think you should assign Huo Yao to another class. My class is fully occupied. If I take one more student in, it will affect the performance of other students.\u201dHe sounded pretty determined. Embarrassed, the Dean cast a glance at Huo Yao. The Principal had gone through many troubles just to persuade the transfer student to come to their school.The Dean cleared his throat and said to Huo Yao, \u201cHuo Yao, please give me a moment.\u201d Then, he winked at Wei Mingzhe and stepped out of the office.With a frown, Wei Mingzhe followed the Dean out.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dBefore the Dean could say anything to persuade Wei Mingzhe, the latter interrupted him. \u201cDean, I know what you are going to say. However, all of the Rocket Class are great performers, star students. I don\u2019t need a new student to come in and drag them down.\u201dThe Dean was baffled. \u201cNo, that will not be an issue. You don\u2019t know that Huo Yao is\u2026\u201d\u201cForget it. Please don\u2019t waste your time anymore on this. There is no way that I will accept this transfer student.\u201d1The Dean finally lost his temper seeing that Wei Mingzhe was being so stubborn. \u201cI am going to ask you this one last time. Are you going to accept her?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dThe Dean burst into an angry laughter and said with a sneer, \u201cDo not regret your decision!\u201d1Wei Mingzhe was offended by the Dean\u2019s warning words and attitude. He understood the reason for this reaction and retaliated firmly. \u201cNever!\u201d4\u201cFine.\u201d The Dean took a deep breath and dropped the subject.Right at that moment, the female teacher who had shown Huo Yao to the Office of Academic Affairs happened to come there. Sensing the odd atmosphere between the two, she asked with a frown. \u201cWhat is going on with the both of you?\u201dThe Dean\u2019s temper was still volatile. He turned to the female teacher at once. \u201cI want to assign a transfer student to your class. Will you take her or not?\u201dThe female teacher was Chen Yu.The Dean\u2019s words startled her. It took her a minute to understand the question. \u201cTransfer student? Do you mean the one who passed the online exam with a perfect score and was mentioned by the Principal at the meeting, the other day?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d The Dean stared at her with an ardent zeal in his eyes.Before Chen Yu could share her thoughts, he had made the call for her. \u201cIt\u2019s settled then. From now on, Huo Yao will be a member of your Experimental Class. She is in the office, right now. Mrs. Chen, take her to your class.\u201dJust like any key middle school, the No.1 Middle School had set up different levels of classes based on the students\u2019 performances. The best students were in the Rocket Class,while the second-best class was the Experimental Class. Those with average grades were in the average classes.Of course, even the students in the average classes here were better than the students in the key classes of other prominent high schools.The Principal had originally intended to assign Huo Yao to the Rocket Class. However, no one had anticipated that Wei Mingzhe would not accept her, no matter what. Therefore, the Dean had no other choice but to assign Huo Yao to the Experimental Class.It was not the best class but it beat the average ones.Chen Yu, who had just been forcefully fed a transfer student, was still in a daze. She noticed how Wei Mingzhe breathed in a sigh of relief and her heart skipped a beat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Was there any problem with this transfer student?She was ready to voice her doubts. \u201cSir, this\u2026\u201dBut the Dean waved his hand impatiently. \u201cThe Principal has invited some honorable guests over. I have to go now.\u201dEven before the sound of his voice died away\u2026 he was gone.Chen Yu stared at the Dean\u2019s receding figure. A moment later, she turned to look at Wei Mingzhe. \u201cMr. Wei, did the Dean try to assign the transfer student to your class earlier?\u201dWei Mingzhe and Chen Yu were always in competition with each other. After all, one of them was leading the Rocket Classes and the other one, the Experimental Classes. Though the Rocket Classes were better than the Experimental Classes, Wei Mingzhe was still afraid that a dark horse student could join the Experimental Classes, and could defeat his batch.1He cleared his throat. \u201cYes. But I turned her down. After all, not all students can come to our Rocket Classes.\u201dChen Yu could hear that Wei Mingzhe was mocking her, showing off that he would continue to be the winner. Still, she remained calm. \u201cWei Mingzhe, what do you mean by this? Didn\u2019t the transfer student get in with a perfect score?\u201dWei Mingzhe shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t ask me. I don\u2019t care if she is a good student or not, or if she has perfect scores. She is all yours.\u201dChen Yu\u2019s expressions underwent a change. Though Wei Mingzhe did not say directly what was wrong with the transfer student, it was not difficult for her to guess his meaning.The school might have admitted this transfer student using \u2018perfect score\u2019 as a cover.No wonder Wei Mingzhe would gloat about this issue.To refuse Huo Yao was not possible for her at this moment. Hence, Chen Yu took a deep breath and went into the office.When she saw the girl in the office, the former was surprised again. It turned out that the transfer student was the one whom she met at the Principal\u2019s office.Back then, she had been busy collecting her documents and assumed that this girl was in another year. She never expected that\u2026 the girl would end up in her class.For a moment, Chen Yu\u2019s emotions became complicated. She cleared her throat and said, \u201cHuo Yao, from now on, you are a member of Experimental Class Three. I am your class adviser, Chen Yu. Let\u2019s go.\u201dChen Yu\u2019s tone was not bad, per se, but it was not kind, either.Huo Yao had been in the office all this while and unfortunately, managed to hear the entire conversation which happened outside.No one would be happy when they had to accept a seemingly \u2018problematic\u2019 transfer student.Therefore, Huo Yao understood why Chen Yu would have a detached attitude towards her.Huo Yao replied politely. \u201cOk, Ma\u2019am.\u201dChen Yu could not help but give another look to Huo Yao. This pretty girl was gentle, neither humble nor pushy.People were visual creatures. When looking at beautiful artifacts or people, no matter how bad one\u2019s mood would be, their emotions would mostly change for the better. That applied to Chen Yu as well.She remembered that Huo Yao was from a remote county city. People said that kids from small places were more mature and thoughtful. No wonder, Huo Yao appeared to be sensible.Never mind. Because of Huo Yao\u2019s good manners, Chen Yu decided that she would accept the transfer student wholeheartedly, no matter how bad her scores were.7**Soon, Chen Yu had brought Huo Yao to their classroom.The classroom was full of noise and clamor. However, everyone settled down as soon as Chen Yu came in.Chen Yu was strict with her students, and always maintained a strict look. She was known as the female devil. Many students in the class were scared of her.Chen Yu was happy that her students knew how to behave. She cleared her throat, turned around, and introduced Huo Yao to the class. \u201cShe is a new student who transferred from another school. Remember to help her from now on.\u201dChen Yu left out the part that Huo Yao was from a small county city.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In a composed manner, she turned around, picked up a magic marker, and wrote down her name, \u2018Huo Yao\u2019 on the whiteboard.2Her handwriting was graceful, and she used the regular script that few people could master. Her strokes were dignified and elegant, which matched her cool vibe.\u201cGood god, this transfer student is so good looking and so is her handwriting. I cannot take my eyes off from her.\u201d\u201cWhy is my heart racing?\u201d\u201cLook at her face. I can sense her temperament. I have decided that this new transfer student is now my muse!\u201dChen Yu heard her students murmuring in the class. She frowned and cleared her throat again. All of a sudden, the noisy discussions quietened down.She told Huo Yao to take the empty seat in the last row by the window on the right side of the classroom. Then, Chen Yu started lecturing her students on focussing their minds on their study and told them to make the best of this self-study class before she left the class.2As soon as she went away, the classroom that had been as silent as a graveyard, became noisy again. Huo Yao was the hot topic of discussion, currently.The girl sitting next to her said, \u201cHi, I am Meng Ying. Since, we will be deskmates from now on, feel free to ask me if you have any questions.\u201dMeng Yin had a doll-like face and delicate features. She appeared to be a kind and adorable girl.Huo Yao turned to her and raised an eyebrow in a flirty way. \u201cThen, can I borrow your chemistry test book, my darling?\u201d4Meng Yin stared at Huo Yao in a daze. Her porcelain skin turned red because of the \u2018my darling\u2019 remark from Huo Yao. Meng Yin covered her face with her hands at once.Good heavens. How enticing was this new student! Meng Yin\u2019s princess-like heart could not handle this flirtation.Huo Yao was utterly confused about the girl\u2019s reaction. She was merely asking to borrow her book and nothing else.4It took Meng Yin quite a while to calm her throbbing heart down. Finally, she remembered that Huo Yao had asked to borrow her book. She took out her chemistry book from her desk drawer and handed it over. \u201cHere you go.\u201dHuo Yao gave her a gentle smile and said, \u201cThank you.\u201dAgain, Meng Yin felt her heart beginning to race. She only managed to stutter her answer after a pause, \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2019re welcome.\u201d3Huo Yao threw her another look with a smile and then began to go through the textbook.Meng Yin gulped. She felt tremendously happy to be seated next to this girl, who was both beautiful and special!Besides, the new student seemed to be fond of studying. Meng Ying chided herself and took out a book for herself as well.***The power of public voice was strong. Within one morning, the entire senior grade had found out that an almost perfect girl had transferred to Experimental Class Three.Some students came to the classroom to check out Huo Yao during the breaks, purely because of curiosity.All the students who passed by her class, started talking about how beautiful this transfer student was.Soon, those words reached Lu Xia\u2019s ears.Lu Xia was in the Rocket Class. Her grades were good and she ranked above average in the class. When she found out that in merely a few hours, Hua Yao had stirred up such a sensation, Lu Xia was frustrated beyond measure.5Since she was in the Star Training Camp, she had become quite popular across the school. Before Huo Yao came in, she was recognized as the muse for many people and also the official campus belle. No one had been able to take that position away from her in a long time.However, she felt a sense of crisis building up inside her right now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I think she looks quite pretty.\u201d The gossiping nature in Chang Yingying kicked in as she commented on the picture.Lu Xia cast her eyes on the phone.The photo only captured the side profile of Huo Yao, and was a little hazy. Despite that, Lu Xia felt as if Huo Yao was proclaiming loudly that she was the most outstanding person, different from the masses.For a second, Lu Xia\u2019s eyes lost their shine. Since the day she met Huo Yao, she had known that Huo Yao\u2019s prettiness would catch people\u2019s attention. But Lu Xia didn\u2019t expect that this day would come so soon.She could not quite figure out why Huo Yao seemed so different than what she had expected her to be.She had heard that Huo Yo was a coward who lived with a sense of inferiority complex during her growing years!Lu Xia suppressed the questions which she had and lowered her gaze. By the time she looked up, there were no signs of unhappiness visible on her face. She agreed with Chang Yingying\u2019s comment in a gentle voice. \u201cYes, she is pretty.\u201dChang Yingying felt scared all of a sudden. How could she praise another girl\u2019s looks in front of her muse?Wasn\u2019t this an insult to her?Bothered by this thought, Chang Yingying took her phone away at once and put it on her desk, screen down.Then Chang Yingying smiled and said, \u201cAnyways, she can never be more beautiful than my Xiaxia. You are our campus belle. A transfer student that has come from nowhere can never compare with you.\u201dLu Xia lowered her eyelids and reproached her in a low voice. \u201cYingying, you cannot say that. Huo Yao is from a county city, but no one can deny that she looks good.\u201d\u201cHuo Yao? Xiaxia, do you know that transfer student? Is she from the countryside?\u201d Chang Yingying felt that she had stumbled across a juicy piece of gossip.Lu Xia covered her mouth as if regretting her slip of the tongue. After a while, she whispered. \u201cYou can say so. She grew up in the Lu Family earlier.\u201dChang Yingying stared at her in astonishment. \u201cSo, she is the fake daughter, that imposter?\u201d4The campus belle\u2019s strange life story was well known in the school.Lu Xia replied in a severe voice. \u201cHush, Yingying, keep your voice down. Don\u2019t let anyone hear you.\u201dChang Yingying pouted. \u201cLetting other people hear me is not bad. She is an imposter, to begin with. She enjoyed being a daughter of a rich family for over a decade while you lived in the poor family which she originally belonged to\u2026 I take my words back. She is not pretty!\u201d1Lu Xia cast a look downwards, and a faint grin flashed across her lips. She patted Chang Yingying\u2019s shoulder and said to her, \u201cYou cannot let anyone know about this. After all, Huo Yao is innocent.\u201dBut Chang Yingying sneered in response. \u201cAren\u2019t you innocent as well?\u201d2She did not attach much weight to Lu Xia\u2019s words. \u201cXiaxia, you are too kind. She can take advantage of you!\u201d2But Lu Xia defended Huo Yao, ardently. \u201cNo, Huo Yao is not like that.\u201d\u201cAnyways, don\u2019t let me find out any dirt on her. Or, I will make her life miserable.\u201d Chang Yingying declared, coldly.4Lu Xia grinned but said nothing else.***Before Huo Yao left school in the afternoon, Chen Yu told her to stop by the office to finish her enrollment procedure. She was also going to give her a temporary student card.When she was getting the IDcard ready, Chen Yu thought of something that the Dean had told her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He managed to pick up the Acceptance Letter from that security guard. The guy was suffering from diarrhea and had forgotten to take his phone with him, which led to that big confusion in the morning. Don\u2019t let it bother you.\u201d4Chen Yu told Huo Yu what the Dean had instructed her to say.Huo Yao thought about it and said, \u201cMs. Chen, I understand.\u201dHuo Yao\u2019s answer was polite. Chen Yu could not help but say a few more words. \u201cYou have just come to our school, and may need to adjust yourself. Also, the teaching method which we adopt here is different from that in the county school. The senior year is the most important year of all. If you have any questions, make sure that you ask me. Alright?\u201dHuo Yao gazed at Chen Yu.The latter was just one step away from saying the words, \u201cI know that you are poor in studies, and I am just trying to help you.\u201dHuo Yao grinned in return and said, \u201cMa\u2019am, you can trust me a bit more.\u201dHuo Yao sounded confident.Huo Yao\u2019s grin took Chen Yu\u2019s breath away. After a moment, Chen Yu was about to say something, only to notice that Huo Yao was gone.This student\u2026 might not be as bad as Wei Mingzhe had suggested.1**As soon as Huo Yao stepped out of campus, her phone began to ring. She took it out and saw that it was an unknown number.At the same time, she heard someone honking a car. A familiar black sedan fell into her sight.Huo Yao raised her eyebrows. She didn\u2019t pick up the call and strode towards the car.The window lowered, and the person whom she had met this morning, revealed himself. \u201cWant a ride?\u201d\u201cWhy? Are you buying me dinner?\u201d Huo Yao didn\u2019t get in just yet. She didn\u2019t ask him if he was waiting for her on purpose, either.Min Yu put on a faint smile, which washed away some of the coldness on his face. \u201cSure, no problem.\u201dHuo Yao pulled the back door open and replied. \u201cFine. But I have to get back home right after dinner. My parents will be worried if I go back too late.\u201dAfter she got into the car, Huo Yao texted Song Ning.\u201cSince when have you started to behave yourself?\u201d Min Yu started the car. He looked at Huo Yao in disbelief. He was thinking of that neighborhood girl who would often climb over the wall at night, just to have fun.2Huo Yao turned around and looked into his eyes. Instead of answering him, she asked him, instead. \u201cWhen did I not behave myself?\u201dMin Yu burst into laughter and shook his head. If he told her that he had seen her in action, she might accuse him of stalking her. Therefore, he chose not to answer the question.Not long after, Min Yu pulled the car in front of a private home-cooking restaurant. The decoration of the place looked quite exquisite.They went to a private room. Huo Yao put her bag down and picked up the menu. She had ordered a few dishes before she remembered the man sitting across her.Min Yu added two more dishes and told the waiter to go, leaving only him and Huo Yao in the room.Huo Yao was playing on her phone when she asked him in a casual voice. \u201cHow did you get my phone number?\u201dShe didn\u2019t remember having given him her number.Min Yu poured himself a cup of tea. The enshrouding steam dispersed in the air.He said, \u201cYour grandma told me to take care of you.\u201dHuo Yao looked up at Min Yu in surprise. She never thought that she would hear such words from his mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But she is not as spirited as before. I think she misses you terribly.\u201dHuo Yao looked down. For a moment, neither of them said a thing. When she left the small county, Huo Yao had deliberately not waited for her grandma to come back from the hospital so that their parting would be less sad.A moment later, Min Yu added. \u201cBut your foster mom has brought your grandma back to the city. You can visit her any time.\u201dHuo Yao nodded her head. She knew that He Xiaoman would do so. Hence, she was not surprised to hear this. At the same time, she was puzzled by another fact. \u201cWhy do you know all of this?\u201dWhen she was still in Fuxian County, this man lived next door. But, he didn\u2019t visit them much, and her grandma had never mentioned him.Min Yu raised his eyebrows and gave a different response. \u201cI even know where your grandma lives.\u201dHuo Yao suddenly broke into laughter. \u201cYou know so much. Are you a bodyguard whom my foster mom has hired?\u201dMin Yu\u2019s face twitched as the sound of her voice faded away.A bodyguard?He, bodyguard?He finally found his voice and said, dryly, \u201cHow creative is your thought process!\u201dHuo Yao cheekily replied to him. \u201cThank you. Jokes aside, I don\u2019t think that my foster mom is generous enough to hire a bodyguard to follow me.\u201dHuo Yao\u2019s voice held disdain. Min Yu smirked but didn\u2019t say anything.The waiter came in to serve the dishes. After all the dishes were served, it was the two of them in the room again.Min Yu changed the topic and said, \u201cThis morning at the gate, you weren\u2019t allowed in. Was it because the security guard took your Acceptance Letter away?\u201d\u201cSo, you also know about this?\u201d Huo Yao stared at him.Min Yu smiled and said, \u201cI overheard it.\u201dHuo Yao pouted and picked a piece of rib for herself and mumbled. \u201cHow good is your hearing!\u201dMin Yu leaned back in his chair. He had not touched the dishes yet. \u201cI take it that your transfer process was not smooth.\u201dHis remark seemed to hold a deeper meaning.Huo Yao paused in her actions. She remembered the call which she had received from He Xiaoman and a scornful grin flashed past her lips.She said with a shrug, \u201cJust some vile person causing trouble.\u201d\u201cDo you need any help?\u201d Min Yu asked.Huo Yao kept her eyes on the dishes, while the food in her mouth muffled her voice. \u201cNope.\u201dAfter dinner, Min Yu paid the bill and asked Huo Yao. \u201cDo you want to visit your grandma now?\u201dHuo Yao shook her head. \u201cNo, it is getting late today. Some other time.\u201d\u201cI will text you her address later,\u201d said Min Yu.\u201cOK.\u201d**By the time Huo Yao arrived home, it was almost eight. She felt some odd vibe in the house as soon as she came through the door.Huo Jinyan and Song Ning sat in the living room with the TV off. They seemed to be in a serious mood. Why?Huo Yao wondered.She greeted them and said, \u201cMom, Dad, I am back.\u201dSong Ning stood up from the sofa and walked to Huo Yao. Since her mind was weighed down, even her smile was forced.\u201cHow was your first day at school? Any problems?\u201d Song Ning asked.\u201cIt was good.\u201dAfter two seconds\u2019 of pause, Huo Yao asked her. \u201cMom, do you have any questions for me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40: Bring Lu Xia And Huo Yao CloserSong Ning was embarrassed that her daughter had seen through her. \u201cNot really. I am just wondering who you went to dinner with. Your classmate?\u201dSo, this was what had been bothering her.Huo Yao shook her head and said, \u201cNo.\u201dSong Ning put forward another question, gingerly. \u201cA boy or a girl?\u201dHuo Yao looked at Song Ning, and replied patiently. \u201cWith a guy, who was my next-door neighbor in the county. I once helped him out and happened to run into him today. So, he treated me to dinner.\u201dSong Ning looked into her daughter\u2019s eyes. Seeing how sincere she was, somehow, Song Ning felt guilty about all those filthy thoughts she had on her mind.Awkwardly, she touched her nose and gave up on asking more questions.In a gentle voice, Song Ning said, \u201cOh, I see. Don\u2019t misunderstand me. I am just worried that staying out too late is dangerous. You are a girl.\u201dHuo Yao could not understand what was really on Song Ning\u2019s mind, but she had a hunch. She answered obediently. \u201cI understand.\u201dHearing her sweet voice, once again, Song Ning felt guilty about her speculation. \u201cYou must be tired after your first day at school. Go and take a shower. Don\u2019t stay up too late.\u201d\u201cOh, and I have kept some warm milk for you. Take it upstairs with you and drink it before going to bed.\u201dSong Ning hurried to the kitchen as she said so and took out the milk which had been kept in the heat-insulated box. She handed it over to Huo Yao with a smile.\u201cSure. Thanks, mom.\u201dAfter Huo Yao went upstairs with the milk, Song Ning heaved a sigh.She went back to the living room and sat down besides her husband. She started blaming herself. \u201cI am not a good mom. How can I question my daughter\u2019s integrity?\u201dHuo Jinyan patted her hand. \u201cI have told you that you need to trust your daughter more. Don\u2019t speculate wildly just because of some rumors.\u201dSong Ning glared at him. \u201cIt is our oldest son who misled me, today. He called me and said something about paying attention to the friends Yaoyao was making. That is why\u2026 Never mind. Let me call him. I have to ask him why he dislikes his sister!\u201dSong Ning was really angry. Huo Jinyan shook his head and stopped her before she could dial the number.\u201cYanxi and Yaoyao are on bad terms. If you call and question him now, it will only deepen their misunderstanding. Don\u2019t you think?\u201dSong Ning\u2019s fingers stopped and she threw the phone away.After a moment, she said in an upset voice, \u201cThis is such a headache.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that this is such a big problem. Yaoyao has just come back, and they don\u2019t know each other well. Don\u2019t push them.\u201dCompared to Song Ning who was overthinking, Huo Jinyan was more composed.Song Ning heaved another sigh and leaned against the soft cushion on the sofa. Suddenly, something came to her mind.She sat up again and said, \u201cI almost forgot about this. Xiaxia is friends with Yanxi. I can ask Xiaxia to act as a mediator between them.\u201dHuo Jinyan squinted at her and shook his head again. He disapproved of the idea. \u201cHave you forgotten? It was because Yanxi mentioned Xiaxia that he and Yaoyao became estranged.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t forget. I am just saying that Xiaxia is a kind girl, and she studies at No.1 Middle School, as well. If I ask her to get to know Yaoyao more, it will be the first step to patch things up between Yaoyao and Yanxi.\u201dAs a mom, Song Ning felt that her mind was forever occupied with her children.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: Dispirited GrandmaHuo Jinyan immediately began to counter his wife\u2019s words with logical reasoning.\u201dI suggest that you give up on this idea. The day our daughter came back, you consciously distanced yourself from Xiaxia. You even told her to start calling you Aunt Song. Are you under the impression that Xiaxia was not hurt by your words?\u201dSong Ning produced a weak smile.She said, \u201cI was mad at Xiaxia that day. She knew that Yaoyao had just come back from the countryside and she deliberately rubbed that in Yaoyao\u2019s face. If there were other people around, they would belittle Yaoyao because of this. Yaoyao would have been the one upset if I hadn\u2019t used those harsh words on Xiaxia. Don\u2019t you think?\u201dTaking a deep breath, Song Ning continued. \u201cXiaxia grew up in our family. Though she is not our biological kid, I have always treated her as my child. Do you think that I am happy to see her sad?\u201dShe treasured both the girls but Song Ning could not deny that she cared more about her biological daughter. That was the power of a blood bond.Besides, Song Ning had raised Lu Xia for 17 years and never treated Lu Xia unfairly. On the other hand, Song Ning\u2019s biological daughter, Huo Yao had supposedly been raised by a wealthy family. But the truth was that she was abandoned and sent to that remote county by the Lu Family.It was her grandmother who took care of Huo Yao since childhood. As a result, Huo Yao became a stay-at-home child, who grew up in a harsh environment. How lonely Huo Yao must have been when she was a kid!Every time these thoughts came to her mind, Song Ning would feel her heart ache for her daughter. Now that her biological daughter had come back, Song Ning wanted to try her best to make up for the years gone by.Song Ning felt herself sinking into a swirl of guilt. Huo Jinyan put his arm around her shoulders and comforted her in a gentle voice. \u201cYaoyao is a good kid. Everyone likes her and Yanxi will, as well. Give it some time.\u201d**It was Sunday. Huo Yao bought some presents before her visit to Yang Qiuhua.Yang Qiuhua was living in an apartment for the elderly in the downtown area. The community had a nice environment. Without schools or large shopping malls around, this community was quiet and suitable for the elderly.He Xiaoman was a mean and pretentious person. But, she did treat her mom well.Before Huo Yao reached the place, she called up Yang Qiuhua and informed her about her visit. Soon after she rang the doorbell, the door was opened.Yang Qiuhua teared up when she saw Huo Yao. Hurriedly, she asked Huo Yao to come inside.The apartment was spacious and the decoration was of good quality as well. The place had all the necessary appliances, yet somehow, it seemed lonely.Huo Yao took all of this in a glance. Her grandma was busy, getting her fruit and water. She was so ill at ease as if she were the kid here.\u201cGrandma, take a rest. Come, sit down and talk to me.\u201dYang Qiuhua sat on the sofa and rested her eyes on Huo Yao. After a long time, she finally began to talk. \u201cYou look good. I can tell that your parents are treating you well.\u201dHuo Yao smiled and replied. \u201cYes, indeed. They wanted to visit you along with me. But I refused, in case it would be an intrusion.\u201dYang Qiuhua nodded and said, \u201cMaybe another day. Ask them to come and visit when time permits. Today, I just want to have a good chat with you.\u201dEven Yang Qiuhua\u2019s wrinkles were brimming with happiness at this moment. However, the dark circles under her eyes were more pronounced and she appeared to be low on spirits.Huo Yao grabbed her hand and put her finger on Yang Qiuhua\u2019s wrist. \u201cHave you been having trouble sleeping?\u201dAfraid that Huo Yao would be worried, Yang Qiuhua said hastily, \u201cNo. I have been sleeping just fine.\u201dAs a matter of fact, ever since Yang Qiuhua arrived here, she was facing trouble falling asleep, every night.Huo Yao asked her another question right after. \u201cHave you been taking your medicine on time?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42: Scared Of HerYang Qiuhua nodded without hesitation, like a student answering the teacher\u2019s question. \u201cYes. I didn\u2019t forget what you had told me. I have been taking them regularly and haven\u2019t missed the dose even once.\u201dHuo Yao took her finger back. \u201cDo you still have the incense that I gave you?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 I use some every night.\u201d When Yang Qiuhua answered this question, she was visibly hesitant.Huo Yao grinned wickedly. \u201cIf you had, you wouldn\u2019t have experienced palpitations and insomnia.\u201dYang Qiuhua lowered her head at once. It was some time before she continued. \u201cActually when I moved here, I forgot to bring the incense with me.\u201dA dark glint arose in Huo Yao\u2019s eyes. But she still sounded composed and asked in a casual voice. \u201cIs that so?\u201dEvery time Yang Qiuhua saw her granddaughter speaking in a serious tone, her heart would start to race. Still, Yang Qiuhua worked up the courage to say, \u201cYes. I am not lying to you.\u201dHuo Yao smiled. She did not refute it even though Yang QIuhua was visibly hiding something. She got up and stood behind Yang Qiuhua. She began to rub her grandmother\u2019s head with her long, slim fingers. \u201cRelax. Let me give you a message.\u201dYang Qiuhua wanted to say that she didn\u2019t need to do this. However, she held herself back when she saw the expressions on Huo Yao\u2019s face.Yang Qiuhua didn\u2019t know when it happened but now she felt a bit afraid of her granddaughter when the latter was serious. Yang Qiuhua felt like she could never hide anything from her granddaughter ever.Yang Qiuhua was the senior. However, somehow, she felt like she was the kid in this relationship.Half an hour later, Huo Yao stopped the massage and asked her gently. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201dYang Qiuhua opened her eyes. Embarrassed, she answered with a smile. \u201cIt was so comfortable that I fell asleep.\u201dThen, she turned to look at Huo Yao\u2019s hands. \u201cYou were doing this for such a long time. You must be tired by now.\u201dHuo Yao picked up the cup kept on the side table and sipped some water from it. \u201cNot really. I will get you some incense the next time I come.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Yang Qiuhua nodded happily.Incense was not what she desired. She was just happy that her granddaughter would come again to see her.Yang Qiuhua felt much better today. She talked for a bit with Huo Yao, and then went to the kitchen.\u201cI bought your favorite things today. We have ribs and yellow croakers. I will go and cook them. Just hang in the living room for now. We will have lunch soon\u2026\u201dHuo Yao gazed at her grandma as she went on and on. Huo Yao\u2019s mind began to wander to the past. This was just like when they lived in the small county city.Huo Yao had nothing to do, so she walked around the room and then went to the kitchen. She leaned against the door frame and watched as her grandma prepared lunch.Out of the blue, the doorbell rang.Since Yang Qiuhua was still cooking, she told Huo Yao to get the door. It could be the guy delivering bottled water.Huo Yao opened the door and saw a few people standing outside. She was not particularly surprised.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dIt was He Xiaoman and Lu Xia at the door, with a Lu Family butler who was carrying several boxes of foods and medicines of highly nutritious value.He Xiaoman pulled a long face, the moment she saw Huo Yao.But Huo Yao only spared a casual glance in her direction. She turned around and went into the apartment without even greeting He Xiaoman.\u201cSo rude!\u201d He Xiaoman snorted.Lu Xia didn\u2019t expect to meet Huo Yao here, either. She calmed He Xiaoman down whose mood had turned sour. \u201cMom, relax. Let\u2019s go inside.\u201dYang Qiuhua turned the gas to a simmer and came out of the kitchen. \u201cYaoyao, is it the water guy\u2026\u201dShe wasn\u2019t able to finish her sentence when she saw He Xiaoman. The smile froze on her face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: Grandma Thrashing PeopleYang Qiuhua couldn\u2019t help it and blurted out, unhappily. \u201cWhat are you doing here today?\u201dThen, as if she had just seen Lu Xia, she added. \u201cOh, Lu Xia is here as well.\u201dShe gave them a perfunctory welcome.Lu Xia\u2019s face clouded immediately but she still greeted the old lady with a smile.\u201cWhy can\u2019t I be here? Are you trying to say that Xiaxia and I are the outsiders and should not be here?\u201d He Xiaoman was so angry at her mom that she almost burst into a cackle.Yang Qiuhua mumbled under her breath. \u201cYou should have called before you came here.\u201dIf she knew that He Xiaoman would stop by with Lu Xia today, she wouldn\u2019t have asked Yaoyao to come.\u201cXiaxia bought so many presents for you. Why can\u2019t you treat her better? Mom, you cannot pick sides like this!\u201dHe Xiaoman was convinced that Huo Yao must have cast some spell over Yang Qiuhua. She was so cold to her biological granddaughter while she liked the fake granddaughter, tremendously. What was her problem?\u201cDid you ever treat Yaoyao well?\u201d Yang Qiuhua retorted.He Xiaoman put her hand over her forehead. \u201cNever mind. I don\u2019t want to argue with you. I just want you to be impartial. That is all what I wish for.\u201dYang Qiuhua couldn\u2019t take it anymore and fully mobilized her dissing abilities. \u201cWho wants to argue with you? It is you who came like you wanted to interrogate me. You have spoiled my good mood.\u201dHe Xiaoman\u2019s face turned pale. Seeing this, Lu Xia hurried over to Yang Qiuhua and smiled. \u201cMom, didn\u2019t you buy a set of jadeite jewelry for grandma? Let\u2019s take it out no, please.\u201dLu Xia directed the butler to bring the box. She held Yang Qiuhua\u2019s arm with a bright smile and said, \u201cGrandma, let\u2019s sit down. Why don\u2019t you try on this jewelry and see if you like it. \u201dWith Lu Xia as the smooth talker, Yang Qiuhua\u2019s sullen mood eased out quite a bit. She didn\u2019t resist when Lu Xia took her to sit down on the sofa.However, she didn\u2019t extend her hand to try on the jadeite bracelet which Lu Xia had brought out.She didn\u2019t think twice before refusing it and saying, \u201cI am too old for these things and I didn\u2019t like them to begin with. Put it back in the box.\u201dLu Xia\u2019s outstretched hand paused in mid-air. She could not force the bracelet on her grandma now that she sounded so determined. Embarrassed, Lu Xia put the jewelry back in the box.Soon, Yang Qiuhua shifted her gaze to Huo Yao who was sitting on a recliner, playing with her phone. The look in Yang Qiuhua\u2019s eyes softened. She said, \u201cYaoyao, take a look. Do you like this?\u201dHuo Yao was startled by the sudden reference to her. She looked up and blinked in a daze.Immediately, He Xiaoman turned hopping mad. She came over and said, \u201cMom, she is a student. She cannot wear jadeite jewelry!\u201dYang Qiuhua curled her lips and replied. \u201cShe may not be able to wear it now, but I can give the set to Yaoyao\u2019s biological mom!\u201dHe Xiaoman glared at her. \u201cMom, are you losing your mind? Do you know how much I spent on the jadeite?\u201dYang Qiuhua stared back at her. \u201cWeren\u2019t you giving these things to me as a gift?\u201dShe was implying that she could give the jewelry to whoever she wanted, since it was hers.\u201cI gave it to you as a gift, but you are not supposed to hand the set out to other people!\u201dHe Xiaoman took a deep breath to refrain herself from flying into a rage.Yang Qiuhua was about to refute it when Lu Xia beat her to it. She darted a glance at Huo Yao and said, \u201cGrandma, my mom specifically picked out this jewelry for you, and the price is quite high. It is not appropriate for you to give this to other people as a gift. How about this? I will go to the mall to pick out another present for Yaoyao to take back with her. \u201cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44: Is Three Hundred Thousand Enough?He Xiaoman knew that Lu Xia was trying to give her a way out. However, it was against her will to spend any money to buy a gift for that bumpkin girl of the Huo Family.He Xiaoman sneered and turned her gaze towards Huo Yao. \u201cTaking advantage of a kind old lady to get money out of her, is your ultimate goal, isn\u2019t it?\u201dHuo Yao raised her eyes to meet her eyes. The casual expression remained undeterred on her tender face. She was least affected by what was happening around.He Xiaoman frowned as she went on venting her frustration at the girl. \u201cYou can tell me directly if you want money. Do you think it is nice to dupe an old lady?\u201dYang Qiuhua was afraid that Huo Yao would be upset by these mean words and scolded her daughter at once. \u201cXiaoman, how dare you say such things?\u201dHe Xiaoman\u2019s face shrunk at her mother leaping to the girl\u2019s defence. She scowled and said, \u201cMom, stay out of this.\u201dThen, He Xiaoman strode over and peered at Huo Yao who was still sitting comfortably on the recliner. \u201cTell me. How much money do you need? Do you want one hundred thousand, two hundred thousand? I believe three hundred thousand will be enough for your family to live well for a few years, right?\u201dHuo Yao raised her eyebrows and gave a malicious smile in return. She was leaning against the recliner chair lazily, and was not intimidated by He Xiaoman\u2019s aggressive manner at all. She tucked her loose hair behind her ear before standing up slowly.\u201cOnly three hundred thousand? I thought that you were going to offer me at least thirty million. This means that you don\u2019t value this enough whether I have fooled your mom or not.\u201dHuo Yao\u2019s voice was gentle, and she did not even try to hide the disappointment in her tone.He Xiaoman felt that Huo Yao was spitting out nonsense. A sharp burst of angry laughter came out of her mouth. \u201cHmm, thirty million? I do admire your imagination.\u201dBut Huo Yao looked at her as if she were staring at a fool. \u201cYou mean you cannot even afford thirty million? If it were me, I would be too ashamed to say the words which you just uttered. Terrible!\u201dHe Xiaoman\u2019s blood boiled with rage. Huo Yao was supposed to be a country bumpkin. When did she become such a sharp contrarian?Huo Yao was not in the mood to waste any more time with He Xiaoman. She turned to Yang Qiuhua and said with regret, \u201cI am sorry Grandmother, but I cannot spend the rest of the day with you.\u201dYang Qiuhua knew that Huo Yao was not willing to hang on but she wanted Huo Yao to stay. However, given He Xiaoman\u2019s attitude, Yang Qiuhua understood that she could not persuade Huo Yao to do so.Never mind.Yang Qiuhua heaved a sigh and produced a forced smile. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Another time. And, don\u2019t let He Xiaoman\u2019s words bother you.\u201dHuo Yao nodded and left from there.As soon as Huo Yao was gone, He Xiaoman snorted. \u201cMom, you cannot let her come here from now on. Look at how arrogant she is. She didn\u2019t treat me with any respect!\u201dYang Qiuhua was really annoyed by her daughter\u2019s nagging. She stood up without saying anything, went to the kitchen, and turned off the stove.She stared at the vegetables in a daze, which she had prepared lovingly for Huo Yao. Eventually, Yang Qiuhua wiped a few tears from her eyes and stepped out of the kitchen. She paid no heed to He Xiaoman and Lu Xia, who were still in the living room. She went to her bedroom and slammed the door shut.He Xiaoman was taken aback by her behaviour. After a few seconds, she began to complain. \u201cWhat is she doing? What is she angry about?\u201dLu Xia looked at the closed door and whispered. \u201cMaybe grandma just likes Huo Yao too much.\u201dHe Xiaoman was in a terrible mood. \u201cHow stupid she is to not be able to differentiate between fish eyes and pearls!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: Unidentified People?Huo Yao left her grandma\u2019s apartment, hailed a cab, and went back to the Huo Family.After she arrived, she saw some shiny and formal male shoes by the door. Were her parents entertaining guests?She thought for a few seconds and then put the house keys back in her bag. Hua Yao turned towards the elevator, and pushed the button. Since the elevator was still on this floor, the door opened at once, and Huo Yao went back in.Reaching the ground floor, she took a seat on the bench kept outside. Her looks were spectacularly eye-catching and whoever went by her, even kids, could not stop sneaking repeated glances at her.Huo Yao was wearing a hooded sweatshirt. To avoid becoming the center of attention, she put on the hood and took out her phone. Soon, no more people would stare at her.Huo Yao played several rounds of a multiplayer online battle arena game which she had downloaded some time ago. She logged off from the game after a while because the game was not challenging enough. Suddenly, she remembered a certain someone and opened her WeChat.She only had a few friends on WeChat. She browsed through the contact list and unblocked the person nicknamed [Y] whom she had once found annoying. She sent a message to that person after thinking for a bit.Medicine Pill: [Be careful in the near future. Do not go out if you don\u2019t have to.]That person must be online right now because the moment her message was sent, Y had typed many replies already.Y: [OMG, finally, the big shot has remembered me.]Y: [You have no idea what I went through recently. I was in hell!]Y: [I am always hungry, and I don\u2019t have enough clothes to wear. I had to stay on my knees in the ancestral hall. So exhausting.]Y: [Please, can you help me get out of here? I miss the air outside.]Medicine Pill: [\u2026 You must not be worn out enough if you still have so much energy left to type these many words.]Y: [???? Are you serious?]Medicine Pill: [Logging off now.]Y: [Hold on. What did you mean by telling me to be careful? Can you be a bit more specific?]However, when the last message was sent, the reply that Y received was a red exclamation mark with the words, \u201cMessage delivery failed. Message delivery denied.\u201dY: [???] #!Again the same message.Y: [(\u03a9\u0414\u03a9)] #!And again, the message delivery had failed, and been denied!**Huo Yao logged out of her WeChat. She looked up and saw a few bulky men in identical black suits stepping out of the lobby. The person leading the group carried a silver color, coded case.These people looked like a bunch of hooligans who had just finished collecting their fees. They walked in an orderly array and created a vibe that warned everyone to stay away. The residents in the neighborhood walking by looked wary of them.Huo Yao squinted, and by chance, she happened to notice their shining shoes. How intriguing.But the men failed to notice Huo Yao. They headed straight to the garage from the lobby. They knew the way well, so they must be familiar with the neighborhood, and must have come often.Huo Yao frowned. After those men were out of her sight, she stood up. She thought for a bit, and then went back to the building. Getting inside the elevator, she went home.When she exited the elevator, she saw that those shining black leather shoes were gone from outside her house\u2019s door.Huo Yao made sure that she had wiped off the questions from her face before she took out her keys and opened the door.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: DebtSong Ning was tidying up some cartons in the living room when Huo Yao\u2019s unexpected coming back startled her. The account book slipped off from her hand and fell to the ground.Song Ning\u2019s face froze in genuine surprise. She quickly picked up the accounts book and stuffed it into one of the cartons and said, \u201cYaoyao\u2026 why are you back so soon? Didn\u2019t you say you were going to spend the day with Grandma Yang?\u201dHuo Jinyan was wearing glasses and holding a calculator. He looked at his watch and asked Huo Jinyan in confusion, as well. \u201cHoney, you\u2019ve only been out for a couple of hours. Did you forget something?\u201dHuo Yao gave a fleeting glance towards the paper carton placed in front of Song Ning and replied with a straight face as if she had not noticed anything out of place. \u201cGrandma Yang had visitors, so I came back.\u201dSong Ning answered. \u201cOh, I see\u2026\u201d\u201cThen you haven\u2019t had lunch yet, right? Your dad and I didn\u2019t know that you were coming home for lunch, so I haven\u2019t cooked anything yet. Wait a moment. I am going to clean this up and make lunch.\u201d Song Ning added quickly.Having said so, Song Ning placed a few accounting books into the carton quickly, along with her husband\u2019s calculator.\u201cPut those things back in our bedroom. I\u2019ll go and cook lunch.\u201d Song Ning said to Huo Jinyan.\u201cRight away.\u201d Huo Jinyan replied as he put down his glasses.He picked up the cartons, and went upstairs.Huo Yao stared at his back, for a moment, in wonder. Then, Huo Yao followed Song Ning to the kitchen.She helped Song Ning trim some vegetables and, at the same time, asked a seemingly random question. \u201cDid you have any guests over today?\u201dSong Ning shook her head. \u201cNope. Why do you ask?\u201d Did her daughter run into their accountants? Song Ning thought to herself.Huo Yao kept her eyes down, and replied in a calm tone. \u201cI saw some clean slippers in the shoe cabinet just now.\u201dThere was nothing out of the ordinary in her voice.Song Ning\u2019s hand trembled slightly. \u201cI cleaned the shoe cabinet this morning. Your dad interrupted me in the middle of it. I might have forgotten to put those extra slippers back because of that.\u201d She explained, smilingly.\u201cMm.\u201d Huo Yao said. A few seconds later, she brought up another topic. \u201cMom, I met a group of guys dressed in dark suits, downstairs.\u201dAgain, Song Ning\u2019s hand trembled. She was about to give another explanation when she heard Huo Yao\u2019s voice, one more time.Huo Yao looked at Song Ning with a solemn look and said, \u201cThose people looked fierce and violent, the kind of people who give threatening calls. Mom, do we owe someone money?\u201dSong Ning felt guilty in her heart and shook her head in negative. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t owe anyone money!\u201dAfter a pause, she asked in a quiet voice. \u201cThe people whom you mentioned, do they really look scary?\u201d\u201cYes. They don\u2019t look like good people.\u201d Huo Yao gave an honest answer.Song Ning was going to say, \u201cThey are just our company\u2019s accountants, not someone pressing us for money.\u201dBut she swallowed back those words after Huo Yao\u2019s reaction.Indeed, her husband was right. The people from their company had a terrifying look. Song Ning believed that Huo Yao would be scared even if she were to tell her that they were simply accountants. Maybe, Huo Yao would even wonder if her parents were running some illegal business.No. I cannot let Huo Yao find out the truth.Song Ning made up her mind in that minute. Her countenance betrayed nothing unusual as she said, \u201cI think probably someone living on this floor has borrowed money from a loan shark. Remember to avoid those people next time when you see them.\u201dHuo Yao turned around to look at Song Ning. Huo Yao\u2019s long eyelashes cast a faint shadow over her eyelids, hiding her expressions. She didn\u2019t ask any more questions and pulled out the last batch of the vegetables from the basket.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: Be Careful Not To Scare HerAfter lunch, Huo Yao went back to her room, leaving Song Ning and Huo Jinyan in the dining room by themselves.Song Ning remained seated at the table, delaying the washing of utensils. She stayed there so that she could tell her husband about her conversation with her daughter which happened earlier in the kitchen.\u201cI think our daughter believes that we owe people money.\u201d Song Ning rested her elbow on the table, looking worried.Huo Yao hadn\u2019t pressed her with too many questions post that. Nevertheless, Song Ning instinctively believed that Huo Yao must have misread some signs.Huo Jinyan looked at her and asked. \u201cIs it really that bad? She just happened to run into our accountants downstairs.\u201dSong Ning shook her head. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. Her first question for me was if we had any guests over today.\u201d\u201cI think you are overthinking this. She might have just asked those questions casually. Besides, I don\u2019t think Yaoyao is an overly sensitive girl.\u201d Huo Jinyan was still taking it casually.\u201cI certainly hope so.\u201d Song Ning heaved a sigh.All of a sudden, her eyes began to sparkle and she proposed a new idea. \u201cHow about we give her another bank card? That way, she will not misunderstand that we owe people money.\u201dHuo Jinyan actually found this to be feasible. But he suddenly remembered something and said, \u201cShe has not used the black card that I gave her last time, even once.\u201dSong Ning raised her eyebrows but then replied with a shrug. \u201cThat is not a problem. I can just withdraw some cash for her.\u201d\u201cCash won\u2019t work, either. That day, when I was driving her to school, I wanted to withdraw some cash on our way. But she told me that all young people nowadays use phones to pay their bills. Cash is not convenient.\u201d Huo Jinyan shook his head and vetoed this idea.\u201cWell\u2026 how about we transfer some money to her on WeChat? Right! Why did I forget about WeChat?\u201d Song Ning tapped her head. She hurried up and went to the living room to get her phone.She had befriended Huo Yao on WeChat a long time ago. Soon, she found Huo Yao\u2019s name on the contact list and clicked on the \u2018transfer\u2019 button while discussing with her husband. \u201cHow much do you think I should give to Yaoyao? Half a million? A million?\u201dHuo Jinyin frowned and shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t be so over the top. You will scare her.\u201dAfter all, the Huo Family had always been abiding by the rule of maintaining a low-key appearance and staying away from ostentatiousness. Not even Lu Xia knew about the actual wealth of the family. It was her belief that the Huo Family was merely an average one.Of course, had Lu Xia been observant enough, she would have noticed that nothing in the Huo Family was average.Song Ning rolled her eyes at her husband. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you think of keeping a low profile when you gave her the black card the other day?\u201dHuo Jinyan cleared his throat and pretended that he didn\u2019t hear his wife\u2019s question.Song Ning thought for a bit and proposed. \u201cHow about I give her a hundred thousand? That is low-key enough, right?\u201dHuo Jinyan agreed. \u201cSure.\u201dSong Ning typed in the amount which she was about to transfer. She clicked on \u2018Confirm\u2019 and saw a message popping out about the transfer limit.\u201cAre you kidding me? I cannot transfer so much money at one time.\u201d Song Ning\u2019s face became clouded.What kind of crappy restriction was this? This was going to sabotage her effort to remove her daughter\u2019s misunderstanding. It was very important that Huo Yao should not get a wrong impression of her family.Huo Jinyan stroked his eyebrow and said, \u201cHow about you give her ten thousand every day? In this way, our daughter can receive pocket money on a daily basis. She will be much happier. Don\u2019t you think?\u201dSong Ning nodded and confirmed the new transfer amount while saying, \u201cYes. That is a good idea. I believe that this will bring me closer to my daughter.\u201dWhen Huo Jinyan heard his wife\u2019s thoughts about growing closer, it got him thinking. Without saying anything, he took out his phone as well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: Two Large Transfers Of MoneyHuo Yao was in the midst of pulling out her suitcase, which she had brought back from the county, from the closet when she heard her phone chime.But she didn\u2019t go and check her phone immediately. Instead, she took her time to open her suitcase and dug out a long, rectangular box from it.The box contained incense sticks as long as the length of one\u2019s finger. There weren\u2019t too many left in the box, but they should be enough to last Grandma Yang a month or two. Huo Yao closed the box and put it on the desk.At that time, she heard the notification of her WeChat again.She only picked up her phone after she had placed the suitcase back into the closet. Surprised, she saw two messages informing her of money transfers.She unlocked her phone and opened WeChat.The two transfers were from her mom and dad, who were currently sitting downstairs. They had sent identical sums of 10,000 yuan respectively, which was quite a lot.Huo Yao rubbed her forehead. Her parent\u2019s actions befuddled her. She held her phone and spent a long time thinking about something. Eventually, she sent her parents two question marks instead of accepting the transfer.Soon, Ms. Song, which was Song Ning\u2019s WeChat name, sent a message: [Honey, this is your allowance for next week. Come on, accept it. Kisses~ Mommy loves you~]Huo Yao stared at her mother\u2019s reply, silently.A few seconds later, she wrote back: [\u2026 I still have money.]Ms. Song: [No problem, just take it. It\u2019s from mommy. There is no harm for a girl to have a bit more money.]Ms. Song: [Honey, if you don\u2019t take it, I will have no other choice but to buy you more clothes with this money!]Huo Yao looked at the closet full of clothes, still in mint condition. Her mouth twitched. She clicked the button to accept the money, immediately.At the same time, she saw a message from her father, as well.I Am Huo Yuanjia: [Honey, last time you told me that cash was not convenient to use. Hence, I went to the bank to activate my online banking account. I have just added that to my WeChat. Come on and accept this money.]Huo Yao was speechless.I would have believed you if the story was a little more authentic sounding.Soon, she began to type her reply.Medicine Pill: [If I don\u2019t accept it, you are going to give me the money in another way, aren\u2019t you?]I Am Huo Yuanjia: [Wow, baby, you are so smart!]Medicine Pill: [\u2026 Alright.]Therefore, Huo Yao received two large sums of money, despite still being puzzled about the reason for it. As a matter of fact, in the following days to come, she would receive her parents\u2019 transfers regularly and forcefully, which they referred to as, \u2018allowance\u2019.Huo Yao ended her conversation with both of them and turned around to face her desk. After a few seconds, she pulled up a number from the contact list and made a call.Soon, the call went through, and she heard a deep and refreshing male voice. \u201cKid, to what do I owe the pleasure of this call?\u201dHuo Yao curled her lips at the word \u2018kid\u2019. However, since she was going to ask him for something, she didn\u2019t bother to correct the nickname. \u201cAre you busy? I need some help.\u201dMin Yu waved his hand to stop his men from continuing with their reports. He leaned against the chair and went on. \u201cDo tell. What do you need me to do?\u201dHuo Yao did not beat around the bush and came straight to the point. \u201cHelp me send something to Grandma Yang.\u201dMin Yu initially thought she had encountered something grave but her demand was unexpected.Min Yu didn\u2019t say anything for a while which Huo Yao interpreted as that he was unwilling to help out. \u201cNever mind. I know you are busy.\u201dSaying so, she was ready to hang up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: Do You Trust Me?\u201cListen, kid, you need to work on your patience limit.\u201d Min Yu seemed to have sighed in between his comment. His gentle voice brushed past her ears like a breeze.Huo Yao moved her finger away from the call disconnect button on the phone. She rolled her eyes and asked again. \u201cSo, are you going to help me?\u201dMin Yu grinned. \u201cAre you in a rush?\u201dHuo Yao thought about it and gave him an honest answer. \u201cNot really. But, if you have time today, it\u2019ll be the best.\u201d\u201cSure. Text me the address. I will send someone to pick it up.\u201d\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll send you the location later. \u201dHuo Yao ended the call as soon as she finished speaking. She opened up her WeChat and found the contact number of the \u2018neighbor boy\u2019. Without any hesitation, she sent the location of her community to him.*Min Yu received Huo Yao\u2019s message, and replied with an \u2018OK\u2019. He looked up and saw his subordinates who were standing not far away from him. Every one of them looked shocked.Min Yu squinted and the kind expression on his face faded away, instantly. \u201cThat will be all for today. Dismissed.\u201dHis voice was cold.So cold that his subordinates trembled. Quaking with fear, those subordinates looked away and hurried out without making any sound.Zhuo Yun was the last to leave, and Min Yu stopped him.\u201cZhuo Yun, I need you to pick something up.\u201dZhuo Yun halted, and gazed at his boss in silence for a few seconds. Post that, he asked, with extreme caution. \u201cPicking something up from Huo Yao?\u201dMin Yu twirled his phone and answered. \u201cMm.\u201dThe look on Zhuo Yun\u2019s face was complicated. Nonetheless, no matter how many questions he had, he couldn\u2019t dare ask even one of them. He nodded as a reply and turned around to leave.The moment Zhuo Yun was about to step out of the door, Min Yu, who had been leaning against his chair, stood up all of a sudden. \u201cNever mind. I will go myself.\u201dZhuo Yun, \u201c\u2026\u201dAre you still the boss that I know?**Twenty minutes later, Min Yu arrived in Huo Yao\u2019s neighborhood.He sent Huo Yao a WeChat message to inform her of his arrival. Soon, he saw a slender girl coming out from the aged iron gate.He lowered the car window and gazed at the girl as she came closer. A trace of curiosity was visible in his handsome face. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to your grandma\u2019s house yourself since it\u2019s the weekend?\u201dHuo Yao gave him the wooden box and answered calmly. \u201cToday is not a good day.\u201dMin Yu glanced at the wooden box and then grinned at Huo Yao. \u201cYour foster mother wouldn\u2019t let you visit, right?\u201dHuo Yao glared at him. It was some time before she gave a response. \u201cFor those who don\u2019t know better, would think that you have planted a surveillance camera around me.\u201dMin Yu chuckled and shook his head. \u201cYour family\u2019s problem is obvious. It\u2019s not that hard to figure out.\u201dHuo Yao clasped her fists like a swordswoman from the ancient times. \u201cThank you for helping me out. I will buy you dinner someday.\u201dMin Yu raised his eyebrows. \u201cDo you honestly have so much trust in me?\u201dHuo Yao was about to go back when she heard his question and halted. A gentle breeze was flowing, bringing some hair to her cheeks.She tucked the loose hair behind her ear and cast her eyes on Min Yu. A distant smile sprang on her face. \u201cThat\u2019s not the reason. Actually, this thing is not so expensive.\u201dWith that said, she left. What a tsundere girl!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: Huo Yao\u2019s Extraordinary Ability?Even though the girl was walking further and further away, Min Yu kept gazing in her direction. After a long time, he recovered and broke into a laugh, shaking his head. How tsundere was she!Zhuo Yun was on the driver\u2019s seat, and had witnessed his boss\u2019s reaction by looking through the rear view mirror. Hou Yao\u2019s arrogance didn\u2019t seem to annoy Min Yu, at all. Again, Zhuo Yun asked himself if this person indeed was his boss.Someone must have switched his boss with an impostor!\u201cGo.\u201d Min Yu cast a glance at Zhuo Yun. The former\u2019s voice had turned indifferent, nothing like the warm honeyed version from a few minutes ago.Zhuo Yun, \u201c\u2026\u201dNope. His boss has not changed.Zhuo Yun started the car and, at the same time, threw a glance at the wooden box which Min Yu was holding.Out of curiosity, Zhuo Yun said, \u201cThis box seemed to be pretty old. I wonder what is inside.\u201dMin Yu lowered his eyes. The box was made of sandalwood with relievo on its edges. The corners of the box looked worn down, and the color of the box was deep. Therefore, it did appear to be from ancient times.However, a mark on the edge of the box seemed to be familiar. Min Yu thought hard for a minute. He seemed to have seen it somewhere.Deep in thought, Min Yu touched the lever on the box but eventually decided not to look inside. He put it on the seat and looked outside through the window. He cautioned Zhuo Yun in a soft voice. \u201cCuriosity killed the cat.\u201dZhuo Yun, \u201c\u2026\u201dDoes this Huo Yao possess some extraordinary powers?About half an hour later, Zhuo Yun drove Min Yu to the community where Grandma Yang lived.\u201cI\u2019ll go and drop it.\u201d Zhuo Yun shifted the gear into parking and unfastened his safety belt.Min Yu cast his sight on the wooden box. \u201cNo. Let me. You wait here.\u201d Min Yu turned down Zhuo Yun\u2019s proposal.This answer startled Zhuo Yun yet again. He took a second to calm himself down before he cautioned Min Yu. \u201cBe careful.\u201dMin Yu glared at him. \u201cDon\u2019t be so high-strung all the time.\u201dThen, Min Yu got off with the wooden box in his hand. In the car, Zhuo Yun touched his nose and grumbled. \u201cBeing vigilant is my second nature!\u201d**Min Yu got into the elevator and soon arrived on Grandma Yang\u2019s floor. He pushed the doorbell button.About a couple of minutes later, the inner door opened. Grandma Yang opened the security door after she saw the person standing outside, clearly. \u201cMin Yu, I am glad to see you here.\u201dMin Yu smiled politely at her. \u201cHi, Grandma Yang.\u201d\u201cCome on in.\u201dGrandma Yang found a pair of clean slippers for him and said, \u201cHow did you find time to come today? Do you not have classes?\u201dMin Yu changed into the slippers and followed Grandma Yang into the living room. \u201cI have the afternoon off, so I could come and see you.\u201dMin Yu took a look at the living room and gave her the wooden box. \u201cGrandma Yang, Huo Yao asked me to bring this to you this afternoon.\u201dGrandma Yang was holding a cup of water which she was about to give to Min Yu. His words startled her. Her hands trembled, and the cup fell from her hand to the ground. With a clang, the cup broke into pieces, and water spilled everywhere.Min Yu put the wooden box on the side table and said, \u201cGrandma Yang, let me take care of it.\u201dHe reached out and helped Grandma Yang to the sofa. He was about to go and clean up the broken glasses when Grandma Yang grabbed his arm.Her face was pale. She stared at Min Yu, lips trembling. With tremendous efforts, she managed to shake a full sentence out of her mouth, \u201cYaoyao\u2026 She won\u2019t come to see me anymore, is it?\u201dTo his surprise, Min Yu found that Grandma Yang looked badly shaken up at this moment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: Nerve Soothing Incense SticksStill baffled, Min Yu said nothing in reply.Grandma Yang forced a smile and went on. \u201cThis morning, Yaoyao came, and bought me so many things. But neither of us expected that my daughter would come\u2026 My daughter is mean, and she never liked Yaoyao.\u201d\u201cMy daughter used harsh language. So, Yaoyao stayed here for less than an hour and left in anger.\u201d\u201cYaoyao must be angry. That must be why she is not coming in person to drop this.\u201dGrandma Yang teared up, and would not let go of Min Yu\u2019s arm as if letting him go would mean that he would not listen to her and abandon her. Grandma Yang was blaming herself.Min Yu got a general idea of what happened. No wonder that girl asked him to help her deliver the box.But, given how mature the girl was, she would not be so easily displeased.When Grandma Yang stabilized a bit, Min Yu comforted her tenderly. \u201cGrandma Yang, don\u2019t worry so much about it. Huo Yao is just worried that she will run into your daughter if she comes again. That is why she asked me to bring this to you.\u201dGrandma Yang listened to his explanation with a pinch of salt. \u201cDo\u2026 do you mean it?\u201dMin Yu nodded. He was a man of integrity, and his deep eyes seemed to contain a persuasive power that made people trust him.Grandma Yang\u2019s disturbed mind miraculously calmed down. She picked up the wooden box from the side table.She flipped open the clip-on button although Min Yu was still here. When she saw the incense sticks inside, a warm smile spread over her face, unknowingly.Her granddaughter was not abandoning her. She still cared about her.She had sensed her grandmother\u2019s troubled sleep and despite being wronged by her foster mother, she still asked Min Yu to send her the incense sticks.Grandma Yang wiped her tears off and closed the box. She said to Min Yu, in an embarrassed voice, \u201cI forgot myself for a moment there. Sorry.\u201dMin Yu was still staring at the wooden box in Grandma Yang\u2019s hand. After a moment of contemplation, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I understand.\u201d\u201cYaoyao is a good kid. She could figure that I was suffering from insomnia, so she bought those nerve-soothing incense sticks for me\u2026 Alas, my daughter is not fortunate enough to be Yaoyao\u2019s mom.\u201dGrandma Yang heaved a long sigh. She staggered to a cabinet, opened a drawer and put the wooden box inside.Min Yu listened patiently as Grandma Yang continued to chat. There was something on his mind, but no one knew what it was.**Half an hour later, Min Yu left Yang Qiuhua\u2019s apartment.Zhuo Yun noticed that Min Yu got into the car in a preoccupied manner. He couldn\u2019t help but ask. \u201cWhat happened?\u201dMin Yu looked up and gave Zhuo Yun a casual look. \u201cNothing.\u201dZhuo Yun did not pursue the topic any further.Min Yu tapped his finger on his knee every now and then. All of a sudden, he came up with an idea. He took out his phone and sent Huo Yao a message telling her that he had finished the task.Huo Yao probably did not have her phone with her at that time because it was 10 minutes later that Min Yu finally got a reply. It was a simple one with merely two words, \u2018Thank you\u2019.Nothing else.Min Yu grinned. He must have grown used to Huo Yao\u2019s indifferent attitude.He began to type another message: [Where did you buy the nerve-soothing incense sticks for your grandma? Someone in my family is suffering from insomnia as well.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: The Icy Eye Candy, Huo YaoHuo Yao was busy studying. Having said thanks to Min Yu, she put her phone away. After she received this new message from Min Yu, Huo Yao fell into contemplation.A moment later, she typed in her response: [I bought it online from a random store. I can send you the link if you want.]Huo Yao opened a shopping app, fumbled through the \u2018Favorites\u2019 folder, and found a store. She copied the link and sent it to Min Yu on WeChat.Min Yu looked up the store the link to which Huo Yao had sent him.The store had three crowns as its rating and sold a variety of goods. This was not a store specializing in incense products. But the sandalwood and agilawood incense were in boxes that did appear to be similar to the box which he gave to Grandma Yang. The price was cheap, around two hundred for a box.Min Yu did not find the same kind of incense in the store. But, he was sure that the nerve-soothing incense sticks had most likely been bought from this store.If those incense sticks were indeed that unique and special, why would they be sold in this online store at such a low price?Min Yu closed the app. A disappointed smile played on his lips, and the glow in his eyes dimmed. There might be something else that he was feeling other than despair at this moment.***It had been half a month since Huo Yao enrolled in No.1 Middle School.She behaved in a carefree manner and rarely communicated with her classmates. She never participated in any school events. To her teachers, her quietness was a representation of her cleverness and good behavior. However, her classmates interpreted this as proof that she was a piece of icy eye candy.Her classmates did not know about her academic record. Moreover, her beauty was breathtaking. Therefore, she began to be widely acknowledged as the icy eye candy.At the same time, because of doubts about her academic records, a rumor that, \u2018the icy eye candy only got into the school because she bribed someone\u2019 started flying around in the class.Since Huo Yao was oblivious to the outside world, this rumor naturally escaped her attention.On the contrary, her deskmate, Meng Ying, was enraged after she heard this gossip. In a fit of rage, she almost went to argue with others. At the same time, Huo Yao was busy reading books and studying both, during classes and breaks. Meng Ying had to finally admire Huo Yao\u2019s composure.Meng Ying rested her chin on her hands and gazed at Huo Yao with a serious face. Finally, she spoke up, \u201cThey are all wrong about you. You are not a piece of icy eye candy.\u201dHuo Yao closed the book which she was reading and cast her sight on Meng Ying. Huo Yao raised her eyebrows. \u201cAnd?\u201dMeng Ying found Huo Yao\u2019s casual bearing quite enticing. She gulped before she answered with indignation. \u201cYou are clearly a bookworm!\u201dHuo Yan played with the corner of her book and gave a meaningful answer. \u201cThe only way to improve one\u2019s intelligence is by studying.\u201dMeng Ying heaved a sigh. \u201cI have a feeling that you are implying I am stupid, but I have no proof for this.\u201dHuo Yao smiled but said nothing more. Her phone began to vibrate all of a sudden, and the screen lit up. Two new messages of money transfers popped out.Huo Yao was starting to get a headache on a daily basis now.This again. It had been almost half a month. Her parents would transfer her some money at exactly the same time, every single day. It was as if her parents had more money than they could spend.Meng Ying just happened to see her phone through the corner of her eye. Staring at the two messages, Meng Ying could not help but say, \u201cToday is another day that my eyes have been blinded!\u201dHuo Yao, \u201c\u2026\u201dThat was right. It had been several days since Meng Ying discovered that her deskmate received a large amount of money every day. Ever since then, her initial shock had given way to numbness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53: Pulling Strings\u201cHuo Yao, come clean. Is your family crazily wealthy?\u201d Meng Ying sounded jealous.Huo Yao darted her a look and picked up her phone without batting her eyelashes. Right in front of Meng Ying, Huo Yao unlocked her phone, opened up WeChat, and accepted Ms. Song and I Am Huo Yuanjia\u2019s transfers. She could not look any more indifferent.Meng Ying, \u201c!!!\u201dGood god! She wanted to swap with her deskmate\u2019s life. She would take away all of her money on WeChat, and more than that, she would keep Huo Yao\u2019s wealthy parents to herself!\u201cAlas. Comparisons are odious.\u201d After a moment, Meng Ying sighed, pretending to be sad. \u201cHow come I don\u2019t have wealthy parents who would pamper me in this manner?\u201dHuo Yao tilted her head and casually fixed her bangs with her finger. Her crystal clear eyes glistened with enchantment. \u201cDon\u2019t be sad about your parents not being wealthy. You still have the chance to become a wealthy mother to spoil your daughter.\u201d\u201cPff!\u201dMeng Ying gave Huo Yao a thumb up. Anyone who said that her deskmate was an icy beauty was in the wrong. Listen to her. Huo Yao obviously had a clear mind and a sharp mouth.Meng Ying thought of the rumors that she was hearing these days. She moved her butt closer to Huo Yao and adopted a more serious tone than before. \u201cAnyways, there has been some gossip about you. Have you heard?\u201dHuo Yao asked in a normal voice. \u201cWhat gossip?\u201dMeng Ying thought for a couple of seconds before replying. \u201cSomeone said that your academic scores are really poor, and you are not even as good as the students in the average classes. As per the rumour, you bribed someone, and that is how you got in here.\u201dNo.1 Middle School was not like Desheng, the elite school next door. The students had to pass tough tests to get into No.1 Middle School and all of them were star students. The rules and principles of No.1 Middle School were really strict.The Principal was a tough character, famous for being impartial and incorruptible. It sufficed to say that no one could pull any strings to get into No.1 Middle School.However, in the rumors, Huo Yao was being depicted as the exception who had broken the rules of No.1 Middle School.Truth be told, spreading the rumor in itself was not the worst thing that had happened. What mattered was that the rumor made it sound as if Huo Yao had sullied the reputation of the school.During the past few days, Meng Ying had seen how Huo Yao\u2019s parents would transfer money in her WeChat account every day. From this, it was not hard for Meng Ying to deduce that Huo Yao came from a rich household. It seemed that for Huo Yao\u2026 pulling strings was not entirely unlikely.Of course, Meng Ying was unwilling to believe this rumor. After all, her deskmate\u2019s perfect attitude in studying was fairly evident to her.Meng Ying\u2019s complicated emotions were evident all over her face. Huo Yao grinned and answered her with a question of her own. \u201cDo you believe it?\u201dMeng Ying shook her head and said immediately, \u201cMe? Of course not. The only thing you do all day long, is study. You are a big ol\u2019 bookworm. Anyone else can get in here by bribing someone, but not you.\u201dHuo Yao broke into laughter at this comment and shook her head.Meng Ying was such an innocent girl.Huo Yao was completely unaffected by the rumor and Meng Ying sensed that. She said, \u201cWhy do I feel that you are not anxious at all, after listening to this?\u201dGenerally speaking, when people heard that they were victims of slandering, anyone would be furious.Huo Yao kept her gaze on Meng Ying and contemplated in silence. A few seconds later, she gave a brief response. \u201cThe wise do not buy rumors.\u201dMeng Ying curled her lips. \u201cI understand that. However, if the rumor keeps spreading like this, I am afraid you can get into trouble. If those idiots make a big scene and the Principal gets to know about it, it will be really bad.\u201dAfter a pause, Meng Ying thought of something. Her eyes were glowing as she stared at Huo Yao. \u201cI have an idea of how to end the rumor quickly.\u201dHuo Yao was briefly interested. \u201cOh? Humor me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54: Quiz Contest And Recommendation\u201cLast week, the school\u2019s official online forum posted a notice for the National Quiz Contest which seems to be quite prestigious. There is a municipal preliminary contest, then you move up to the provincial level and then the national level. The top three will join the international contest on behalf of the country.\u201dMeng Ying took out her phone as she told her about it.Soon, she logged onto the forum and dug out the post, showing it to her. \u201cHere it is.\u201d\u201cThe online registration will end in a couple of days. I think you can sign up for this. Since this is a national competition where many outstanding students will come together, I don\u2019t think we should aim for the national championship. But, if you can pass the municipal preliminary contest, that will be enough to prove your strength.\u201dHuo Yao cast her eyes on Meng Ying\u2019s phone. One glance later, Huo Yao had bent over her desk again. \u201cBoring. Not interested.\u201dMeng Ying\u2019s lips twitched. She pushed Huo Yao\u2019s arm. \u201cMiss, this is the best way to clear your name. It will be such a shame if you miss the chance.\u201dHuo Yao yawned and closed her eyes. \u201cPass.\u201dShe didn\u2019t need to clear her name at all.Meng Ying heaved a sigh. Her deskmate was such a lazybone who cared about nothing.**After the second class in the afternoon, Huo Yao was told to go to Chen Yu\u2019s office.Huo Yao always behaved herself in front of Chen Yu. As such, when Chen Yu saw Huo Yao, her forever cold face thawed a bit. \u201cAre you interested in the National Quiz Contest?\u201dHuo Yao did not understand why Chen Yu would ask her about this contest.\u201cYou have just transferred to the school, and my advice would be that you don\u2019t participate in such contests. However, since you have already signed up for it, I cannot talk you out of it. I only hope that you remember to spend more time on your studies. You are a senior year student now. This is one of the most critical years of your life.\u201dChen Yu shared her sincere words and earnest wishes with her.Huo Yao wanted to say that she didn\u2019t sign up for the contest when all of a sudden, she remembered that Meng Ying had made extreme efforts to try and persuade her into signing up for this, in the morning. After a few seconds of silence, Huo Yao said sure.Soon, she asked another question. \u201cMs. Chen, how much is the reward for the first place winner?\u201dChen Yu, \u201c???\u201dShe wondered if she was hallucinating.The strange expression on Chen Yu\u2019s face had revealed the answer to Huo Yao. Huo Yao, who had started to become excited about the contest, felt her excitement fizzle out. Even her voice sounded a bit low. \u201cI have to go back to the classroom now.\u201dChen Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201dChen Yu remembered something and shouted to Huo Yao the moment she was about to leave her office. \u201cThere is no bonus, but the first place winner can win a recommendation to Tsing University. If you win a price in international competition, your future will be more than promising.\u201dTsing University was one of the top three universities in the country. Many people exhausted all their means to try to get into Tsing University. Besides, every year, Tsing University accepted only a limited number of students. Anyone recommended to the Tsing University would not have to take the college entrance exam. That was much more valuable than some monetary reward.However, Huo Yao showed least interest in this. As a matter of fact, she seemed to be disappointed. She nodded her head without even turning around and stepped out of the office.Chen Yu watched as Huo Yao went away. Her eyebrows were knitted together. Why did she feel that this new transfer student was not participating for the chance of a recommendation, but for the money?Chen Yu laughed at herself.Was she losing her mind? Why would she mention the recommendation to a girl who only got into the school through her connections? What a fanciful illusion! She should have persuaded Huo Yao to do what was within the range of her potential, right?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: Huo Yao\u2019s Name Must Go!After the registration deadline passed, Chen Yu printed out a registration form of the Experimental Classes and submitted it to the Vice-principal.The Vice-principal looked at the sheet and asked. \u201cWell? How come so few people signed up?\u201dIn total, the Experimental Classes had forty students, but only three signed up for the contest.Chen Yu forced a smile on her face and explained. \u201cI think it\u2019s probably because the students want to focus their minds on their studies instead of spending their time on the contest.\u201dThe Vice-principal read through the names. When Huo Yao\u2019s name leaped into his sight, he froze for a second. \u201cIs this Huo Yao a transfer student? Why did she sign up for this? Does she not have to study hard to catch up with the schedule here?\u201dChen Yu felt embarrassed to answer this question. \u201cShe might be looking for a challenge.\u201dThe Vice-principal only knew that Huo Yao was specially recruited by the Principal, but had no idea about Huo Yao\u2019s academic records. A few days ago, the Vice-principal heard from Wei Mingzhe about this student and her condescending attitude.\u201cNonsense!\u201dThe Vice-principal frowned.\u201cThe Education Association takes this contest very seriously. I can deal with it if this transfer student can outperform herself and pass the municipal preliminary contest. However, if she cannot, and other schools find out that we have registered a transfer student just to fill in the numbers, what do you think that will do to our reputation?\u201dThe Vice-principal was serious, and Chen Yu knew what he said made sense.She said, \u201cI agree, nevertheless\u2026 Isn\u2019t the registration open for everyone?\u201dThere was no rule against a transfer student participating.The Vice-principal failed to argue against her using this rational reason. \u201cNo matter what, the transfer student\u2019s name cannot appear here.\u201dChen Yu kept silent for a few seconds. \u201cIs that\u2026 can we do that?\u201dThe Vice-principal lost his patience. \u201cOf course.\u201dChen Yu lowered her eyes. She knew that the only reason Huo Yao could come to the school was because she had some strong connections. Judging by the Vice-principal\u2019s attitude, Chen Yu could tell that he was not the one who had allowed Huo Yao in. That only left\u2026 the Principal?If Huo Yao found out that she was disqualified for no reason after she signed up, would she go to the Principal to figure things out?At this thought, Chen Yu suggested, \u201cShould I\u2026 ask the Principal first?\u201dThe Vice-principal hurled the form onto his desk grumpily. \u201cAre you saying that I cannot make this simple decision because I am merely the VICE Principal?\u201dOn one side, Chen Yu had to consider the Principal\u2019s feelings. On the other, she could not ignore the Vice-principal, either. How hard was this!Though frustrated inside, Chen Yu had to keep that smile intact on her face. \u201cSir, that is not what I mean. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay to disqualify Huo Yao without a proper reason\u2026\u201dThe Vice-principal sneered and waved his hand to cut her off. \u201cStop. There is no need to go to the Principal, and I will not cross her name off the form. Let it be.\u201d\u201cSir\u2026\u201d\u201cNow, if you will excuse me, I have other things to do.\u201d The Vice-principal kept a straight face. He picked up the form, walked to the other side of his desk, and tossed the paper into a drawer.Chen Yu knew that now was not the time for her to argue any further. She walked away, looking embarrassed.The Vice-principal sat down in his chair, and his expression was awful. After a moment, something came to his mind and his lips curled in a sneer.He could not wait to see how this transfer student from a remote place ended up humiliating the Principal!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56: Sister Big Shot, Have You Offended Anyone?Huo Yao had no idea that because of the contest, the Vice Principal had categorized her as a delinquent student. Due to the rumor of her getting admission to the school through bribes, apart from her own classmates, even the students of the Rocket Classes and the average classes were beginning to judge her.She had poor academic records and was only admitted because of some strong connections. She was such a shame to the school!Such being the case, when her name appeared on the list of students participating in the National Quiz Contest on the notice board, the students started snickering. This was the funniest episode at the beginning of this semester.[Dear God, who gave the transfer student the courage to sign up for the National Quiz Contest? Isn\u2019t she embarrassed?][Is she under the impression that she can pull strings at the National Quiz Contest as well?][I will bet one penny that she won\u2019t pass the preliminary contest.][Good heavens. I have a feeling that this time, the shame for our No.1 Middle School will reach far across the province and into the international stage.][Alas. Why can\u2019t she just enjoy being a piece of eye candy?]\u2026When Meng Ying saw Huo Yao\u2019s name in the list, she was astonished.\u201cSister Big Shot, didn\u2019t you say that you were not interested in the National Quiz Contest? You turned me down when I told you to sign up that day.\u201dMeng Ying pouted in anger. Her moon-face became even chubbier, like a hamster.Ever since she found out that Huo Yao would receive money every day, Meng Ying had been calling Huo Yao, Sister Big Shot, and now it had become a habit.Huo Yao was confused. \u201cDidn\u2019t you sign me up for it?\u201dMeng Ying blinked in sheer puzzlement. \u201cI didn\u2019t. I hoped that you could participate, but I sure did not sign you up.\u201dHuo Yao knitted her eyebrows. \u201cThen who did?\u201dIf she knew that it was not Meng Ying who had signed her up for it, she would have turned it down when Chen Yu called her to the office.Meng Ying pulled her hair and stressed upon her innocence in this matter again. \u201cSister Big Shot, I did not sign up for you. You have to believe me.\u201dHuo Yao looked at her calmly. \u201cOk, I believe you.\u201dMeng Ying stuck her tongue out in relief. She was afraid that Huo Yao would not trust her. After all, participating in the National Quiz Contest was not a joking matter.Meng Ying tilted her head and thought for a bit. Then, she began to tap into her detective skills. She analyzed the situation and said, \u201cIs it possible that someone did this on purpose to see you embarrass yourself?\u201dHuo Yao gave no response and kept her eyes downwards.\u201cAll the participants of the contest are straight-A students. Imagine this. Someone signed up for you assuming that your score is bad with the intention that you will disgrace the No.1 Middle School and will no longer be able to stay here. Sister Big Shot, think about it. Have you offended anyone recently?\u201d Meng Ying crossed her arms in front of her chest. She had come straight to the heart of the issue.Huo Yao remained composed. \u201cDoes it count if someone is envious of my good looks?\u201dShe managed to use an earnest tone.Meng Ying rolled her eyes at her. \u201cPlease take this seriously. I cannot analyze the problem when you are behaving like this.\u201dHuo Yao looked at her and said, \u201cOh.\u201dThen, she bent over her desk and closed her eyes.Meng Ying, \u201c\u2026\u201dSister Big Shot was different from other people in dealing with things, drastically so.Meng Ying heaved a sigh. \u201cDo you want to go to the Female Devil and explain this to her?\u201dThe Female Devil was a nickname the students had given to Chen Yu behind her back.Huo Yao answered without opening her eyes. \u201cNope.\u201dThat came as a surprise to Meng Ying. She wondered aloud. \u201cAre you saying that you are going to participate in the contest?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57: Strive For A Prize At The Provincial Level\u201cYes.\u201d Huo Yao answered. She had already moved on from the question of who signed up on her behalf.Meng Ying blinked. Though she did not believe that Sister Big Shot did not get admission in the school through connections, she didn\u2019t think her academic records were that outstanding.The other participants for the contest were basically the top 10 students from different classes. Sister Big Shot\u2019s name on the list was like a drop of poison in a tun of wine. No matter how good she was, the straight-A students would steal all her thunder.\u201cAre you up for this, Sister Big Shot? This contest is not a joke. Do you know how many people are waiting to see you embarrass yourself?\u201d Meng Ying tried to talk Huo Yao out of it.After all, quitting now was less humiliating than to fail the first preliminary contest.Maybe Meng Ying had been nagging her for so long that Huo Yao eventually opened her eyes. She put her hand on the edge of her desk to pull herself up, and slowly moved in closer to Meng Ying in a somewhat aggressive manner.Her eyes were sparkling, and her voice was magnetic. \u201cDo not ever ask people if they are up to something.\u201dSister Big Shot\u2019s face was right under Meng Ying\u2019s nose. The latter could see every expression on the former\u2019s amorous, exquisite face. Huo Yao\u2019s voice sounded ambiguous and enchanting.Meng Ying felt as if her heart was about to leap out from her throat, and she could not do anything about it.Under Huo Yao\u2019s gaze, Meng Ying covered her face with her hands and moved back to her seat. \u201cWell, Sister Big Shot, don\u2019t look at me with your seducing eyes next time. I am afraid you are going to turn me gay.\u201dIf she did turn gay, she would never hear the end of it from her parents.Huo Yao chuckled. Finally, she had freed herself from Meng Ying\u2019s never-ending nagging. She bent over her desk again and even covered her head with the chemistry textbook.Sitting next to her, all Meng Ying could say was, \u201c!!!!\u201dSister Big Shot, you would lose all your friends this way!**In the meanwhile.\u201cXiaxia, do you know how overly arrogant that Huo Yao is?\u201d Chang Yingying was dying to share her gossip with Lu Xia who was doing her test paper, quietly.Lu Xia stopped writing and put her pen down. \u201cWhat?\u201dShe looked at Chang Yingying, baffled.\u201cShe has signed up for the National Quiz Contest. Can you believe it?\u201d Chang Yingying could not hide the excitement and sarcasm in her voice.\u201cI wonder who gave her the courage. So many people are waiting to see her fail.\u201dLu Xia raised her pretty eyebrows, tilted her head, and gave a reasonable answer. \u201cAnyone can sign up for the contest. Why would anyone laugh at her?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know this. People are saying that she used money to exert some influence to get into our school. How dare she sign up for the contest with her sorry scores? Don\u2019t you think this is ridiculous?\u201d Chang Yingying sneered.Lu Xia fell silent for a few seconds before she turned to Chang Yingying again. \u201cYingying, the rumor that Huo Yao pulled strings to come here was not spread by you, was it?\u201dChang Yingying evaded her looks, feeling a bit guilty. However, she sounded confident. \u201cNo. I would never do that.\u201dLu Xia put on a soft smile. \u201cI am glad that it wasn\u2019t you. Anyways, Huo Yao is my sister. No matter how bad her scores are, I don\u2019t want to see people discussing her or laughing at her.\u201dChang Yingying had a look in her eyes that said, \u201cI knew it\u201d.\u201cXiaxia, I know you have signed up for the contest as well. You must strive to win a prize at the provincial level!\u201dShe encouraged Lu Xia sincerely.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58: Did Sister Big Shot Come From A Mountain Village?Lu Xia fixed the strands of hair that had fallen on her cheeks and lowered her head. Sitting there, she was like a painting with a soothing look.She puckered her lips in a smile and said, \u201cI will try my best.\u201d\u201cWinning is not a problem for you. Look at your scores!\u201d Chang Yingying never missed a chance to praise Lu Xia.But Lu Xia remained untouched. \u201cAll the participants are the most outstanding students from all around the country.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. To begin with, our school is one of the top-ranking high schools in our country. As for outstanding students, without a doubt, you are one of them.\u201dChang Yingying blinked. After two seconds, she went on with a giggle. \u201cThink about it. You are a famous young celebrity after you went to the Star Training Camp. If you can win a prize at the provincial or the national level, you will win over so many more fans.\u201dThe fact that Lu Xia studied well and was at No.1 Middle School had been made public by her agency to set up her persona. More than half of her fans were students.Imagine this. A girl who was pretty and kind, who could sing and dance and could win a place at the National Quiz Contest, would be a perfect goddess for countless people!Just the fact that Lu Xia was a girl brimming with youthful sunshine, could make her a star among all the schools.\u201cBut things are not looking so good for that fake daughter, Huo Yao. I am thinking that she will be utterly humiliated this time.\u201d Chang Yingying said this as if she could see that happening already.Lu Xia smiled but said nothing in return.**After school, that day, Huo Yao and Meng Ying left together. As they approached the gate, they could see Lu Xia standing not far from them. She was wearing sunglasses and appeared to be waiting for someone.As soon as Meng Ying saw Lu Xia, her gossipy nature began to roar and wanted to burst out of her. She whispered to Huo Yao. \u201cDid you see the girl wearing sunglasses?\u201dHuo Yao gave her a look and replied. \u201cYes?\u201d\u201cShe is our school\u2019s celebrity campus belle, Lu Xia. Sister Big Shot, you must have watched the show \u2018Star Training Camp\u2019, right? She is the most popular contestant on that show.\u201dHuo Yao tilted her head and asked Meng Ying. \u201cAre you a fan of hers?\u201dMeng Ying shook her head at once. \u201cI am not. Don\u2019t you think that everything about her screams fake and pretentious? She is just so artificial. Do you know what I mean?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d Huo Yao mumbled and after a few seconds, she said, \u201cI never watch talent shows.\u201dMeng Ying stared at her in shock. \u201cNo way. Sister Big Shot. From what kind of remote mountain village did you come? How come you never watched any talent shows?\u201dHuo Yao grinned. \u201cCan watching talent shows help me with my studies?\u201dMeng Ying did not know what to say. This was such an enlightening question that penetrated into her very soul.\u201cAlso, don\u2019t discriminate against anyone coming from remote villages. They may turn out to be lions and tigers.\u201d Huo Yao added something that carried much deeper meaning.Meng Ying somehow felt that she and Sister Big Shot were not having a conversation on the same topic.They walked out and went past Lu Xia.Huo Yao did not spare even a look towards the other girl in this entire time. Huo Yao was tall, and was carrying her backpack on one shoulder. Her delicate face was pretty much expressionless. Every inch of Huo Yao was demonstrating that she was even cooler than a boy.The sunglasses helped cover up the dying glow in Lu Xia\u2019s eyes. She waited for a second and stopped Huo Yao. \u201cHuo Yao, Brother Yanxi is coming and picking me up, today. Let\u2019s go together.\u201dAs soon as those words were out there, Meng Ying, who was with Huo Yao, went into complete shock.The celebrity campus belle knew Sister Big Shot\u2019s name and she mentioned something about a brother and used \u201cus\u201d\u2026Meng Ying felt that she had stumbled onto something huge.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59: Troublesome Baby SisterHuo Yao finally stopped and turned to face Lu Xia. \u201cNo. I will take the bus.\u201d Huo Yao refused coldly with a lukewarm look on her face.Before the sound of her voice died down, she had looked away and walked toward the bus station without haste. She never said another word to Lu Xia.Meng Ying, the onlooker, realised that she had stumbled across a big news, and went running after Huo Yao at once. \u201cSister Big Shot, wait for me.\u201dLu Xia\u2019s smile froze on her face, but since she was wearing the sunglasses, she still appeared calm.She watched as Huo Yao went further and further away. Her grip on her purse had tightened.*\u201cSister Big Shot, you know Lu Xia, don\u2019t you?\u201d Meng Ying was convinced of the answer to that question.Huo Yao arrived at the bus station, but the bus had not arrived yet. She gave a perfunctory answer to Meng Ying who was dying to dig up the dirt. \u201cKind of.\u201d\u201cIs she\u2026 your relative?\u201d Meng Ying blinked. She had made a brave guess. A few seconds later, before Huo Yao could answer, Meng Ying suddenly pulled a long face.\u201cOh, no, I am doomed. Sister Big Shot, I have said so many mean things about Lu Xia just now. Will you tell her?\u201d At this very moment, Meng Ying felt that something was pinching her heart.After all, at No.1 Middle School, there was quite a large fan following of Lu Xia. Those fangirls could drown anyone who spoke against their idol, with their saliva.Huo Yao was amused. \u201cDon\u2019t make such a big fuss about this.\u201dThe strong tension which Meng Ying had felt a few moments ago, disappeared without a trace immediately. \u201cListen, you have no sense of humor whatsoever.\u201dRight then, the bus that Huo Yao took everyday, arrived. She got into the line, took out her transportation card and asked Meng Ying. \u201cAre you sure that you want to follow me all the way\u2026 to discuss if I have a sense of humor?\u201dMeng Ying suddenly realized what she was doing. She slapped herself on her head which was filled with gossip. \u201cOh, crap. Why did I follow you to the bus station? My dad is waiting for me at the gate.\u201dWith that, she darted a look at Huo Yao with hidden bitterness and ran off.Huo Yao chuckled.**Lu Xia had got onto Huo Yanxi\u2019s car. After they indulged in some small talk, Lu Xia spoke in an offhand manner. \u201cBrother Yanxi, I have signed up for the National Quiz Contest. The Education Association is paying close attention to this contest and the top 3 students at the national contest will be recommended to Tsing University.\u201dHuo Yanxi turned around to look at her in surprise. \u201cThis sounds interesting. Try your best, and see if you can win.\u201dLu Xia lowered her head and gently flickered the furry ball pendant on her bag, \u201cSure. I saw that Yaoyao has signed up as well.\u201dHuo Yanxi suddenly tightened his grip on the steering wheel. \u201cWhat is she doing signing up for the contest. Considering her score, isn\u2019t that a waste of her time?\u201dHe frowned in annoyance.\u201cI think she might be looking for a challenge. It\u2019s okay. Just think of this as an extracurricular activity for her to broaden her mind.\u201d Lu Xia replied with a gentle smile.Huo Yanxi only shook his head as a reply. His baby sister was turning out to be a source of trouble.**Huo Yanxi took Lu Xia to dinner and then dropped her off at the Lu Family.When he left the Lu Family villa, it was still early. He thought about it and drove to the Huo Family.Song Ning was applying a moisturizing facial mask when the doorbell rang. She was surprised to see her oldest son standing outside when she went to answer the door. \u201cYanxi. It is so late. Did something happen?\u201dHuo Yanxi went inside and looked around before he answered his mom. \u201cI have finished the project. I am planning on staying here for a couple of days.\u201dAnd then, he asked. \u201cWhere is Huo Yao?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60: Why Sign Up For The Contest?Song Ning looked at her son oddly and immediately warned him. \u201cYou want to see your baby sister? What lousy idea is breeding in your head, now?\u201dLast time, after they parted on bad terms, her damn son only called her once and that too, to tell her to discipline her daughter. He had never come back after that.Huo Yanxi curled his lips in frustration. \u201cMom, do you have some misunderstanding about me? I am just asking about my sister.\u201dSong Ning removed her facial mask. Her face managed to demonstrate her disdain to him. \u201cI think you know better than anyone if I have misunderstood you.\u201dHuo Yanxi, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cForget it. I am done talking to you. I have to continue my facial. Suit yourself.\u201dWith that, Song Ning went to her bedroom. After a moment, she halted and turned around to look at Huo Yanxi.Song Ning had a serious expression on her face and said, \u201cDo not disturb your sister. She studies very hard every day.\u201dThen, she went away, leaving only Huo Yanxi and her husband, who was watching TV, in the living room.Huo Yanxi looked at his father. He was about to say something when his father stood up, picked up the remote to shut the TV, and then stretched out his arms. He said, \u201cI got up too early in the morning. I am so tired now. Yanxi, don\u2019t stay up late. Good night.\u201dHis deep yawn had blurred his voice.Post that, Huo Jinyan hurried back to the bedroom, leaving no time for Huo Yanxi to reply.Huo Yanxi, \u201c\u2026\u201dIt had been days since he came home. Already, both his parents loathed him?Depressed, Hou Yanxi went upstairs. He darted a glance at Huo Yao\u2019s bedroom and paused for a second. Eventually, he looked away and went to his bedroom.*The next day was Saturday. There was no class. However, Huo Yao still woke up early to go for her morning jog.When she came back, she went up to her room. While walking past Huo Yanxi\u2019s bedroom, someone pulled the door open all of a sudden, which startled Huo Yao.Huo Yanxi was still in his pajamas. Since he had just woken up, even his eyes were not fully open. As soon as he opened his door, the sweaty Huo Yao leapt into his sight. Instantly, he was fully awake. \u201cWhere did you\u2026\u201dHuo Yao had recovered from her astonishment and answered calmly. \u201cI just came back from jogging.\u201dThis answer took Huo Yanxi aback. After all, this was the weekend. Most people would choose to sleep in.After that, Huo Yao nodded to Huo Yanxi, politely and said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna go now.\u201dHuo Yanxi stared at her absent-mindedly as she stepped away.Twenty minutes later.Huo Yao had come down for breakfast. She was enjoying her meal quietly, eating without haste.Huo Yanxi sat across her. Every now and then, he could cast a look at her. He wanted to chat but failed to find a topic. This was really awkward for him.Maybe, Huo Yao could no longer endure his occasional gaze. She put down her spoon and looked straight into his eyes. \u201cDo you have anything you want to say to me?\u201dHuo Yanxi cleared his throat. All of a sudden, he remembered what Lu Xia said yesterday. \u201cI heard that you signed up for the National Quiz Contest.\u201dHuo Yao was baffled and asked. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d\u201cLu Xia mentioned it yesterday.\u201d Huo Yanxi didn\u2019t think he needed to hide this. So, he answered honestly.Huo Yao raised her eyebrows and simply said, \u201cOh.\u201dShe should have expected this.\u201cWhy do you want to participate in this contest?\u201d Huo Yanxi intended to add words like \u201cthe senior year is important and participating in this contest is a waste of time\u201d, but he held back eventually.Huo Yao giggled and answered with a question of her own. \u201cHave you said those words to Lu Xia? What did she say?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61: Is The Education Association That Mind Blowing?Huo Yanxi frowned and said, \u201cWhy did you bring up Lu Xia again? Are you at the same level as her?\u201dHuo Yao tapped the table gently with her finger casually and replied. \u201cAren\u2019t you the one who brought her up?\u201dHuo Yanxi went speechless and felt that there was no way for him to communicate with Huo Yao properly. Still, he drew in a breath and patiently tried to explain to her. \u201cXiaxia did it for the sake of getting recommendation into Tsing University. What about you? It seems\u2026 pointless to participate in the competition with grades like yours.\u201dAfter pausing for a second, Huo Yanxi added further. \u201cIf you have spare time, you should take some tuition. The most important thing for you now is to improve your grades.\u201dAlthough he was somewhat disappointed with his younger sister, he hoped she could focus on getting onto the right path instead of harboring any fantasies and looking for shortcuts.Huo Yao casually laughed as she looked at him and replied. \u201cSo are you trying to say that I don\u2019t have the right to participate in the quiz?\u201dHuo Yao\u2019s laughter sent Huo Yanxi into a flurry. He instinctively answered. \u201c\u2026 That\u2019s not what I mean. I\u2019m just saying you shouldn\u2019t bite off more than what you can chew.\u201d\u201cSure, I get it,\u201d said Huo Yao as she nodded. Then she lowered her head to continue finishing off the bit of porridge left in her bowl.Huo Yanxi looked at his baby sister. Although she seemed calm and sensible, she deliberately kept a distance from him, which made complicated emotions rise in his heart.Lu Xia would never have placed him in such an awkward situation and would have at least tried to understand what he said.The mood at the dining table became somewhat awkward post this conversation.Huo Yanxi lost all appetite a while later and stopped eating breakfast. Then he looked at Huo Yao and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I hire a tuition teacher for you?\u201dHuo Yao raised her head quizzically and asked him. \u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cSince you\u2019re so persistent about joining the competition, I won\u2019t talk you out of it. I have a friend who works for the Education Association and might be of some use to you,\u201d said Huo Yanxi slowly.Those who made it into the Education Association were either college teachers with advanced teaching licenses or academics from various fields who had contributed to society. If she accepted guidance from a member of the association, it would save her a lot of effort.\u201cThanks, but I don\u2019t need him.\u201d Huo Yao rejected his offer politely but decisively.Huo Yao could not fathom why her older brother was so certain that her grades were lousy enough for her to need tutelage from someone belonging to the Education Association.Huo Yao\u2019s rejection caught Huo Yanxi by surprise. He had reckoned that his thoughtfulness would have moved her.But Huo Yao was completely untouched and even refused Huo Yanxi without a moment\u2019s hesitation.Huo Yanxi looked angry and could not help saying, \u201cDo you know what a boon it is to receive guidance from someone from the Education Association?\u201dHuo Yao looked at him calmly without saying a word.Huo Yanxi held his forehead with his hand and felt infuriated by the sight of her indifference.Then he said sternly, \u201cDo you know\u2026\u201dIt suddenly dawned on Huo Yanxi that Huo Yao had lived in a small county all her life and probably knew nothing about the Education Association. Hence, his voice came to an abrupt halt as he shook his head and said, \u201cForget it. I don\u2019t even know why I bothered trying.\u201dHuo Yanxi stood up and said to Huo Yao, \u201cSince you don\u2019t want my help, just forget that I even asked.\u201dHe could not be bothered with this little sister of his anymore.Huo Yao watched as Huo Yanxi flicked his sleeves and left angrily. Then she took out her phone moments later to type a text message and hit send.[Is the Education Association a big deal?]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62: Was Miss Big Shot A Student?A man had just finished pulling an all-nighter conducting experiments at a graduate school in the capital. The moment he took out his phone, he saw a text message from [Medicine Pill]. He instantly woke up from his daze.The Education Association?Was it not the association set up by a bunch of idealistic academics with nothing better to do?The man had no clue why she asked about it, but he quickly composed a reply: [The Education Association is a talent training ground that recruits talent from all colleges. In terms of status\u2026 they are considered pretty respectable. After all, they do contribute to society.]Huo Yao was suddenly enlightened after reading the message. Then she slowly replied with a single word: [Thanks.]Oh! She had been wondering how formidable it was. In the end, it turned out to be just a licensed Ponzi scheme.[Do you have any kids attending school? A senior of mine works as a director at the Education Association. I can help by getting in touch with him.]The man sent Huo Yao another text message.Huo Yao went into a protracted silence for a long time with her phone in her hand.[Miss Big Shot?]Huo Yao sighed gently and replied: [\u2026No, thanks.]The man sensed something amiss when he saw the reply. Then he decided that she herself could not possibly be a student.[Oh yes, a major black market auction is taking place in the capital in a few days. I heard high-grade Seven Leaf Lotus would be up for sale. Didn\u2019t you say you were looking for this herb? I have an invitation for the black market auction. If you want to go, I can mail you my invite.]Huo Yao pondered for a while before her fingers moved again as she typed: [No thanks. I\u2019m too busy with schoolwork.]The man had sipped some water while he waited for a reply. He got such a shock when he saw the message that water sprayed right out of his mouth.School?No time?Did he hallucinate?Was Miss Big Shot not an elderly person?**Perhaps due to Huo Yao and Huo Yanxi\u2019s conflict earlier in the morning, Huo Yanxi changed his plans about living at home for now and left without staying even for a single day.Huo Yanxi looked at Huo Yao somewhat disappointedly before he left.But Huo Yao was unaffected and continued studying. Song Ning could not help feeling annoyed with her son\u2019s actions when she saw how quiet and diligent Huo Yao was.Song Ning ordered her son not to come back for the time being, out of the fear that Huo Yanxi and Huo Yao\u2019s relationship would become even tenser. She did not want it to affect the atmosphere at home.In the afternoon, Song Ning suffered from a bout of headache, and planned on heading to a traditional Chinese medicine club, which she frequented to get a massage. But Huo Yao stopped her and said, \u201cMom, let me give you a massage.\u201dSong Ning waved her away as she rubbed her temples and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Go on and study. I\u2019ll get an experienced traditional Chinese medicine physician to give me a massage and apply some acupuncture.\u201dHuo Yao frowned when she heard this. Then she said gravely, \u201cYou can\u2019t treat your headache randomly. If the physician doesn\u2019t get the acupuncture point right, it will only make your headache worse.\u201dSong Ning was surprised. Then she smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. This physician has been giving me massages for years, and he\u2019s pretty good, so don\u2019t worry.\u201dHuo Yao went quiet. Then she said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me try? If the headache persists, you can go to your usual physician later.\u201dSong Ning thought her daughter was just trying to be filial, so she didn\u2019t turn her down. She went ahead and sat down in the armchair nearby.At worst, Song Ning would claim that it had stopped hurting and sneak off to visit the physician later when Huo Yao was not looking.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63: A Stupid Quiz Without Any PrizeHuo Yao was clueless about her mother\u2019s plans. She waited for Song Ning to sit down before she rolled her sleeves up and started massaging her mother\u2019s temples moderately with her long slender fingers.Her hands were very dexterous, and an expert would be able to notice that she was rubbing major head acupuncture points with great precision. Even the most experienced traditional Chinese medicine practitioners would not be confident about rubbing some of the acupuncture points which she was currently massaging.Although Song Ning had sat down and obligingly agreed to her daughter\u2019s request at first, she felt a lot better after Huo Yao pressed her head for a while. Huo Yao did a much better job than the physician whom she had been frequenting for dozens of years.\u201cYaoyao, have you learned how to massage before? My headache has almost disappeared after you pressed my head,\u201d said Song Ning with a look of bliss on her face.Huo Yao continued massaging her mother\u2019s head. Then she replied calmly. \u201cI used to give massages to Grandma.\u201dSo that was the reason Huo Yao was so good at this.Song Ning was no longer surprised. Her lips curved into a proud smile as she said, \u201cMy daughter is the best. Even without official training, you\u2019re much better than those massage parlors!\u201dHuo Yao lowered her eyes so that her long eyelashes covered her eyes. Then she asked her mother. \u201cHave you been regularly using the pills I gave you?\u201d\u201cI did. The incense pills were lightly scented and didn\u2019t feel stifling, so they were especially good. I feel the quality of my sleep has improved vastly off late, and even your father\u2019s insomnia got better,\u201d replied Song Ning with a smile.\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve started taking the oral medication I gave you, right?\u201d Huo Yao asked her calmly. Despite wording it as a question, she sounded certain.If Song Ning had started taking medicine, her migraine would not have acted up today.Song Ning pinched her skirt, sheepishly. She replied meekly after a while. \u201cThe medicine\u2026 smells too strong and tastes bitter. I can\u2019t take it\u2026\u201d After taking the medication once, Song Ning could not bring herself to consume it a second time.Huo Yao sighed gently. Then she said, \u201cIt\u2019s for your own good, so you must take the pills.\u201dSong Ning could not help feeling guilty in her heart instantly when she heard her daughter sigh softly, so she hurriedly said, \u201cI promise to take it regularly regardless of how bitter it tastes.\u201dHuo Yao stopped massaging Song Ning and asked her. \u201cOkay. How do you feel now?\u201dSong Ning opened her eyes and instinctively moved her neck a little. Then she exclaimed in surprise. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt at all anymore. I feel invigorated!\u201dHuo Yao raised her brows gently. Of course, it was effective since Huo Yao was the one who had given the message.Song Ning turned around and gazed at Huo Yao. Then she asked her curiously. \u201cOh yes! Your elder brother said you signed up for some quiz, didn\u2019t he?\u201dHuo Yao nodded and replied expressionlessly. \u201cA stupid quiz\u2026 without any reward.\u201dShe gave Song Ning the impression that it was some normal extracurricular quiz, so she said, \u201cOh, I see. Then you can just take the quiz and treat it as practice.\u201dThere was a slight look of annoyance in her eyes. Why did Huo Yanxi have to throw such a temper this morning if it was just a little quiz?Song Ning raised her head and asked her a few seconds later. \u201cCan I find out more about your quiz online?\u201dDespite her daughter\u2019s claims that it was some dumb quiz, Song Ning had to pay close attention to it since she was her mother.Although Huo Yao did not understand why Song Ning asked, she replied with a shrug. \u201cI guess so. Just search for the \u2018National Quiz Contest\u2019.\u201dSong Ning nodded her head with her phone already in hand.Huo Yao glanced at her and said, \u201cThen I\u2019m heading back to my room.\u201dSong Ning responded without even looking up. \u201cOkay. Go on then.\u201dShe had already opened the internet browser on her phone and typed, \u2018National Quiz Contest\u2019.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64: The Preliminary TestA lot of information about the National Quiz Contest popped up on her phone very quickly.Song Ning was all smiles when she saw how popular her daughter\u2019s quiz was. The moment she hit search, so many hits appeared online.But Song Ning\u2019s smile gradually froze before long.Did her daughter not say it was a dumb quiz that did not even offer a prize?How could a quiz that involved city, province, national and international qualifiers, which was co-organized by a few major colleges in the capital and the Education Association be considered insignificant?Although there was no cash prize, the winner walked off with a recommendation to one of the nation\u2019s top universities, Tsing University, and that alone was clearly more impressive than money.Song Ning was stunned and deeply suspicious that this was not the same quiz that her daughter mentioned.So she opened her internet browser and ran another search\u2026***The National Quiz Contest was split into many districts, starting from the preliminary tests at the city level, followed by the provincial level before making it to the national stage. Finally, the top five students in the nation would represent the country to compete internationally.The quiz was not restricted to a single subject, making it far more difficult.After all, students who specialized in the sciences would be far weaker when it came to the humanities and vice versa.A preliminary test conducted by the province\u2019s Education Association was carried out at the city level prior to the heats, and those who passed it, earned their right to compete.The preliminary test was taking place on Wednesday, and all the third-year seniors, who had signed up were to take the test in the school examination halls.There were a total of ten senior classes. Apart from the three people from Huo Yao\u2019s Experimental Class, almost every class had sent five to eight contestants.The vice-principal was very surprised when Chen Yu submitted the application forms.In a blink of an eye, it was Wednesday.The test would commence in the morning. The form teacher, Chen Yu, informed Huo Yao of her candidature number before she headed to the examination hall.Since there were many candidates from the No.1 Middle School, they were split into two examination halls, and Huo Yao was assigned to the second one.She and the two boys from her class were assigned to the same hall. Boys were not as competitive as girls, so they cheered for her bashfully before going to their seats.Unfortunately, Lu Xia was assigned to the second examination hall as well.Since Lu Xia was the school belle, a bright student, and part of a somewhat famous girl band, she attracted a lot of male attention.Most of the contestants were boys, and barely a third of them were girls. Huo Yao and Lu Xia happened to be the only girls in the second examination hall.Huo Yao leaned back lazily in her seat while she twirled the pencil in her hand unhurriedly. She did not look up even once when Lu Xia entered the hall. It was as though she was quietly immersed in her own world.On the other hand, Lu Xia smiled warmly like a dream girlfriend or a goddess. She was very graceful. There was something ethereal about her. In comparison, Lu Xia and Huo Yao\u2019s personalities were distinctly different.\u201cWho do you think is better looking? The campus belle or the new transfer?\u201d\u201cThe school belle. She looks sweet and innocent, is kind to her peers, and has excellent grades.\u201d\u201cI think the new transfer is more beautiful. Although she appears distant, she has such an incredible aura that it is overwhelming for both boys and girls.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true as well. Haha!\u201dSince Lu Xia was sitting in the first row, she caught wind of the conversation behind her. She lowered her eyes slightly and seemed to be completely indifferent to it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65: Was She Secretly A Genius?The invigilator came into the hall with the test papers soon after. After briefly bringing some points to the students\u2019 attention, he handed out the test.Huo Yao scanned through the entire test after receiving it. Then she shook her head rather disappointedly before picking up her pen and completing the test slowly.She had wondered how formidable the Education Association was until she saw the mediocre test paper.They were given an hour to complete the test, but Huo Yao finished it in 30 minutes. Then she lay on the table lazily.Huo Yao would have undoubtedly left the moment she finished the quiz if she were permitted to submit her test ahead of time.Wei Mingzhe was the invigilator of the second examination hall. His impression of Huo Yao was deep but terrible.He could not help shaking his head mockingly when he caught sight of Huo Yao lying down on the table. She was apparently napping halfway through the test. She was poles apart from the other contestants who were absolutely focused on the test.Despite Huo Yao\u2019s poor grades, she could still have had a positive learning attitude. Even if she entered the school by pulling some strings, didn\u2019t she have any self-knowledge of her limits? Did she think that the National Quiz Contest was a child\u2019s play?This was hilarious.Fortunately, Wei Mingzhe had insisted on refusing to accept her into his class, or else she would have driven him mad.The test came to an end in 60 minutes. Although Huo Yao was the first to finish the test, she was the last to submit it.When Huo Yao handed the test to Wei Mingzhe, he did not cast an eye at her or her test paper. Instead, he placed it straight into the document bag before sealing it and leaving the exam hall.**Huo Yao went to the bathroom after leaving the exam hall before heading back to the class.The moment she sat down, her deskmate, Meng Ying, leaned over and asked her. \u201cHow did the test go, Sister Big Shot? I heard the study committee member and class monitor say that the preliminary test was hard.\u201dBesides Huo Yao, the only other contestants from the Experimental Class were the class monitor and a study committee member.Huo Yao looked up lazily. Then she said expressionlessly, \u201cWas it tough?\u201dMeng Ying was dumbstruck and asked in return. \u201cWasn\u2019t it tough?\u201dBoth the class monitor and the study committee member were ranked in the top 20 in the entire level each year, so if they griped about it being hard, it must be true.Huo Yao replied with a shrug. \u201cOkay, so it was hard.\u201dMeng Ying, \u201c\u2026\u201dWhen Meng Ying heard her words, Huo Yao sounded patronizing, arrogant, and a little big-headed.Meng Ying touched her nose tip and continued. \u201cHow many points do you think you can get? Any chance of passing the preliminary test?\u201dHuo Yao raised her brows gently as she said, \u201cHoney, do you doubt my ability?\u201dMeng Ying blushed. She felt Huo Yao was becoming more and more of a rogue. She said, \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that you\u2019re widely under the suspicion of getting into the school through the back door!\u201dHuo Yao waved her hand nonchalantly and Meng Ying shook her head quietly without asking further.Was Sister Big Shot secretly a genius, considering how calm she was?**The preliminary test results would be out the next day at 10:00 am, but Huo Yao was called into the Office of Academic Affairs before they were released.Several teachers were inside the Office of Academic Affairs.Other than her class advisor, Chen Yu, Wei Mingzhe, the Dean of Students, and the Vice-principal were also present.All of them looked particularly grave, especially the Vice-principal and her class advisor.The Vice-principal looked at Huo Yao as he said coldly, \u201cHuo Yao, you must have heard the gossip about you that is going around the school, right?\u201dHuo Yao looked up at him without a shred of fear towards his stern attitude. Instead, she asked airily. \u201cThe one about me pulling strings to get into the school?\u201dThe Vice-principal frowned. He did not expect the new transfer student to have such an attitude.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66: Slander?\u201cYes, that\u2019s correct. You\u2019ve blemished the school\u2019s reputation by raising doubt in society about our practices. Many parents have lodged complaints about this,\u201d said the Vice-principal sternly as he explained the gravity of the matter.He had chosen to close one eye on account of the Principal, but he did not expect gossip to spread so rampantly on campus. Now it was impossible for him to cover it up.\u201cIt\u2019s partly my fault. I thought it was inappropriate when the new school term started. If I knew it would cause such a commotion, I would never have\u2026 Sigh!\u201d Wei Mingzhe exhaled with a look of remorse on his face.Chen Yu glanced at Huo Yao as she stood among them, isolated and helpless. Although it was wrong to pull strings to get into the school, Chen Yu knew that Huo Yao had a great temperament and a positive learning attitude after getting to know her and observing her for so long.This kid was the one who suffered suspicion, became the center of gossip, and kept getting judged by her peers.After staying silent for a few seconds, Chen Yu said, \u201cSince it has already happened, there\u2019s no point blaming anyone. We should focus on thinking about how to kill the gossip.\u201dThe Vice-principal sneered and asked her. \u201cHow can we make the gossip go away? Her parents have no choice but to write a letter of apology and remove her from the school.\u201dThe Dean of Students anxiously said, \u201cNo, didn\u2019t I just explain things to everyone? Huo Yao didn\u2019t enter the school using a backdoor. Why won\u2019t you believe me?\u201dSince they started discussing the matter of Huo Yao joining the school using a backdoor, he kept helping her clarify the matter. But the Vice-principal unexpectedly failed to believe him and insisted on calling Huo Yao over to the office.\u201cIf Huo Yao didn\u2019t enter the school by using her connections, why is gossip spreading so wildly in school? How can you choose to continue covering up for the Principal now that things have come to this?\u201dThe Vice-principal looked at the Dean bitterly and seemed disappointed by his attitude.The Dean frowned when he heard his words. Then he said, \u201cCover up for the Principal? Sir, what are you driving at?\u201d\u201cI always thought that the Principal was a fair and just man\u2026\u201d said the Vice-principal as he glanced at Huo Yao and sneered. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t think he would end up doing something stupid.\u201dAlthough he didn\u2019t explicitly state that the Principal was the one who let Huo Yao enter the school, everyone present got his drift.The Dean seemed to catch on too. Then he angrily burst out laughing as he said, \u201cSir, although the Principal isn\u2019t in town, isn\u2019t it wrong to slander him?\u201dThe Vice-principal\u2019s expression froze. He had always loathed the Principal\u2019s lofty attitude. Now that the opportunity presented itself, he was certainly going to kick him hard, but he did not expect the Dean to be so blatant with his words.\u201cHehe, am I slandering him? Do you think I\u2019ve nothing better to do than to risk the school\u2019s reputation? Since I\u2019m the vice-principal, do you think I can avoid accountability for it?\u201dThe Vice-principal was furious.In an instant, the atmosphere became awkward.Wei Mingzhe looked at them both and pondered briefly. Then he said, \u201cSir, the Vice-principal isn\u2019t targeting the Principal. Weren\u2019t you the one who said Huo Yao was the Principal\u2019s relative on the first day of school?\u201dThe Dean of Students looked at Wei Mingzhe perplexedly and said, \u201cWhen did I ever say Huo Yao was the Principal\u2019s relative? Wei Mingzhe, you better watch your tongue!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67: Remove Your Daughter From School!The Dean swiftly recalled his words which he said to Wei Mingzhe on the first day of school. He had mentioned that Huo Yao was invited by the Principal to join the school. In the end, he got anxious after finding out Huo Yao had gone from there, so he left halfway before he finished the conversation.He wanted to let Wei Mingzhe know how much effort the Principal put in to convince Huo Yao to transfer to their school.Did Wei Mingzhe misunderstand it in the end?The Dean rubbed his forehead.Wei Mingzhe could tell that the Dean had probably recalled the conversation. So he curled his lips and said, \u201cHow could I lie in front of everyone?\u201dThe Vice-principal assumed that the Dean was quiet out of guilt, and he smiled maliciously as well. \u201cStop saying that I slandered the Principal. I can\u2019t be held responsible for this!\u201dThe Dean was about to explain when Song Ning and Huo Jinyan hurriedly came in after they received an urgent notification. They walked into the office anxiously and interrupted him right away.\u201cSir, what happened to my daughter?\u201dSong Ning sounded really worried. She rushed over to Huo Yao when she saw her standing there and pinched her shoulders. After checking her up thoroughly, Song Ning heaved a sigh of relief.She had just received a call from the school for her to come over immediately. The caller sounded so solemn that she was terrified that something awful had happened.The Vice-principal cleared his throat. Then he looked at Song Ning and Huo Jinyan and said somewhat politely, \u201cYou see, we might not be able to allow your kid to attend the No.1 Middle School. After all, coming in through the backdoor has a huge impact. We informed you both to come today to clarify things and have you remove your child from school.\u201dSong Ning and Huo Jinyan both looked at him in astonishment.\u201cWhat\u2026 what do you mean? Sir, can you make yourself clearer? What do you mean about taking the backdoor?\u201d Song Ning was completely puzzled.Before anyone else could say anything, Huo Jinyan spoke with a frown on his face, \u201cDidn\u2019t the school reach out to my daughter and invite her to transfer here? You even sent my daughter an Acceptance Letter.\u201dHe looked upset.Huo Jinyan usually seemed rather amicable in front of Huo Yao, but he gave off an inexplicably imposing aura when he had an angry look on his face.Even someone as proud as the Vice-principal felt somewhat shocked by Huo Jinyan\u2019s imposing aura. But\u2026 what did the husband and wife mean to say?Were they pretending because they did not want to admit to pulling connections to get their daughter into the school?This behaviour was simply too disgusting.Were they acting like this because they were the Principal\u2019s relatives?The Vice-principal laughed angrily and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you know best whether she entered the school due to your connections? Do you want to make the Principal hurry back just to confirm this?\u201dSong Ning was even more baffled. Then she said, \u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019ve gone overboard talking like this? Why should we suffer this accusation if we did nothing of the sort?\u201dSong Ning briefly paused before she continued. \u201cDoesn\u2019t the No.1 Middle School have a strict school culture? Don\u2019t tell me that you accept backdoor entrants?\u201dThe Vice-principal nearly passed out in anger after Song Ning outrageously countered him with a question. They must be acting recklessly due to their connection to the Principal. He finally managed to stutter a reply. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely unreasonable!\u201dSong Ning watched as the Vice-principal\u2019s face turned livid. Suddenly she recalled the grades her daughter had back in the small county and the Acceptance Letter that appeared out of nowhere\u2026Song Ning felt apprehensive in her heart. Suddenly her overpowering confidence dissipated as though she had been stabbed by a needle.Oh no, was her daughter in trouble?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68: She Had Such An Attitude!Although Song Ning was flustered in her heart, it did not show on her face. She only looked at her husband beside her and gestured for him to say something quickly.Huo Jinyan\u2019s imagination did not run wild like his wife. When his daughter first showed them the Acceptance Letter from the No.1 Middle School, it never occurred to him that Huo Yao had obtained it through unsavory methods.After all, the No.1 Middle School was a prominent high school that ranked amongst the top five in the nation, so there was no sense for them to accept someone with poor grades. The school would have to consider its reputation even if someone wanted to pull strings to get in.Huo Jinyan\u2019s face turned cold as he said, \u201cI can assure you that we did nothing of the sort and we don\u2019t know the Principal at all. If you want to convince me to take my daughter out of school, then you better show me some evidence.\u201dHuo Jinyan looked at his daughter as she stood there quietly without moving at all. He glanced at the Vice-principal, Dean, and teachers, and his eyes became increasingly cold.Then he said, \u201cIf you can\u2019t produce any proof, then don\u2019t blame me for telling the media about how the No.1 Middle School bullies its students!\u201dAt the thought that his poor daughter had helplessly suffered this aggressive interrogation on her own before they arrived here, he could not help feeling upset.The Vice-principal started to lose confidence after he saw the resolution in Huo Jinyan\u2019s eyes.Did they make a mistake?When Song Ning heard the harsh words her husband uttered, she could not help coughing. Then she said, \u201cCalm down. Maybe this is some misunderstanding?\u201dWould they not end up slapping their faces if their daughter truly got into the school by pulling strings?Song Ning was unconcerned about embarrassing herself, but she did not want to hurt her daughter\u2019s dignity.The Dean had just exchanged a few text messages from the Principal. When he heard Song Ning\u2019s words, he quickly smiled apologetically and said, \u201cYes, Mr. and Mrs. Huo, it was all a misunderstanding. I was the one who didn\u2019t make things clear enough.\u201dHuo Jinyan narrowed his eyes as he looked at the Dean without saying a word.The look in Huo Jinyan\u2019s eyes made the Dean\u2019s heart palpitate. He said quickly, \u201cThe Principal specially invited Huo Yao to join the school. It was my fault for not making things clearer to my colleagues and causing her to get misunderstood.\u201dWei Mingzhe frowned. Specially invited? Was he trying to help get the Principal off the hook again?Since Wei Mingzhe was not ready to be held accountable, he immediately asked without waiting for the Dean to continue. \u201cOkay, if you say the principal specially invited Huo Yao, then what about her grades?\u201dThe Dean was slightly annoyed when Wei Mingzhe said this. He replied with a scowl on his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her grades? Didn\u2019t I keep telling you that she scored full marks on her admission test?\u201dHe did not understand what this old stick in the mud was up to. When Huo Yao\u2019s parents demanded an explanation, even the Vice-principal did not dare to utter a word. Only Wei Mingzhe obstinately went against Huo Jinyan without recognizing the effort he had made to play the peacemaker.Wei Mingzhe glanced at Huo Yao. Then he sneered. \u201cSir, are you sure Huo Yao entered the school with full marks on her admission test? If she were able to score full marks, she wouldn\u2019t have fallen asleep halfway through the preliminary test yesterday.\u201dAfter pausing briefly, Wei Mingzhe continued righteously. \u201cShe had such a poor attitude yesterday while all the other contestants were carefully doing the test.\u201dWei Mingzhe was implying that Huo Yao would not have slept and treated the test so perfunctorily if she had been competent enough to answer all the questions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even the reigning top student, Yi Lianfan, couldn\u2019t finish it as quickly. Can a new transfer from a tiny county outdo him?\u201dThe Dean pressed his fingers against his forehead and felt that Wei Mingzhe\u2019s bias was becoming increasingly serious.Huo Yao stood there in silence the entire time without defending herself. When she suddenly raised her head, there was surprisingly no resentment on her exquisite face. Then she asked no one in particular, in a calm voice. \u201cAren\u2019t the preliminary test results out by now?\u201dThe Dean raised his hand to check his wristwatch. It was exactly 10:00 am. He walked past everyone and headed to his desk without saying a word.He turned on the computer, logged onto the National Quiz Contest website quickly, and accessed the No.1 Middle School results.A total of 68 students from the No.1 Middle School took the preliminary test, but only 23 of them passed while Huo Yao surprisingly came first.The Dean stared at the computer for a long time without blinking.Wei Mingzhe and the Vice-principal walked up to the computer screen after his protracted silence. They were both stunned when they saw the ranking on the page and the corresponding score.After Wei Mingzhe composed himself, he grabbed the mouse from the Dean impatiently and muttered. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2026 How could she have done better than Yi Lianfan? She clearly didn\u2019t even take it seriously\u2026\u201dBut no matter how many times he refreshed the page, the person, who stood first with a perfect score of 150 points, was Huo Yao.Wei Mingzhe\u2019s hands trembled and the mouse fell to the ground with a thud.1When the Vice-principal saw those test results, his face turned as dark as Wei Mingzhe\u2019s. He looked at Huo Yao with a complicated expression on his face.The Vice-principal had seriously believed that the Principal let this new transfer in through the backdoor. He was certain she had poor grades and had been waiting to see how she would embarrass the Principal during the quiz.At this moment, the Vice-principal gave a self-deprecatory smile.Huo Yao\u2019s class advisor, Miss Yu, also hurried over for a look when she noticed everyone\u2019s strange expressions. She was stunned when she saw Huo Yao\u2019s results on the computer screen.She had scored full marks!Were her eyes playing tricks on her?Had they not been saying that her grades were terrible?Chen Yu had seen the test yesterday. It was more tricky than the final exams. Moreover, the humanities and science topics were blended together. But the Experimental Class was a humanities class.Chen Yu was shocked even more. How did Huo Yao get all the science-related questions right?A student with full marks on this exam would have a considerably outstanding level. Although all-rounded students existed, they were not as crazily good as Huo Yao.\u201cWei, do you have anything else to say now?\u201d asked the Dean sarcastically after he recovered from his shock.Wei Mingzhe suddenly recalled how the Dean had wanted to place Huo Yao in his Rocket Class on the first day of school.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He tasted regret for the first time in his professional life.If\u2026 if Wei Mingzhe did not make false assumptions about her and reject the Dean\u2019s good intentions, then this all-round genius might have become a highlight of his famous teaching career.But\u2026 Wei Mingzhe suddenly looked up at Huo Yao.The student had stayed quiet the whole time. She neither defended nor explained herself. Her eyes brimmed with indifference as though she was waiting to watch everyone make fools of themselves while they argued about her grades until they were completely embarrassed.Wei Mingzhe averted his eyes which were filed with ridicule. Regardless of her grades, he was not interested in insensible students like her.He walked up to Huo Yao and said sarcastically, \u201cHuo Yao, you are quite the character. I\u2019m impressed that you didn\u2019t say a word during this whole time.\u201dSaying so, he left the office expressionlessly without waiting for the rest to react.The Dean frowned. Wei Mingzhe was so\u2026\u201cWhat do you mean by not saying a word? You were the one targeting her from the very beginning and didn\u2019t give her a chance to explain,\u201d muttered Chen Yu.She could no longer take it lying down.When they thought Huo Yao\u2019s grades were poor, they suspected she got into the school using connections. Now that her grades turned out to be brilliant, they ridiculed her for deliberately withholding the fact.If Huo Yao\u2019s preliminary test results had not been revealed, she would probably still be mired in suspicion.\u201cWhat\u2019s up with that teacher? He talked so cynically that it sounded as though my daughter committed a huge mistake.\u201dHuo Jinyan\u2019s face was dark, and he sounded angry.He had walked over to look at his daughter\u2019s results as well. She stood first, scorfing full marks.Although Huo Jinyan did not know what the test was all about, the important thing was that there was no need to take the backdoor with grades like hers.Although it was the school which misunderstood Huo Yao, they still gave them a lousy attitude after her scores were out. They even insinuated that Huo Yao deliberately withheld information without reflecting on their own mistakes!The Dean could tell that the Vice-principal was starting to feel embarrassed. He sighed helplessly in his heart. He walked up to apologize to Huo Yao\u2019s parents and played the role of the peacemaker yet again.20 minutes later, the Dean was finally done seeing Huo Jinyan and Song Ning off while Huo Yao went back to the classroom.Only the Dean and Vice-principal remained in the office.\u201cMr Wu, I\u2019m not trying to find fault here but why didn\u2019t you tell us about this transfer student having such wonderful grades? It\u2019s your fault for causing this embarrassment!\u201dThe Vice-principal still felt mortified the moment he recalled Huo Yao\u2019s test scores.The Dean looked indignant and retorted loudly. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? I told you so many times, but did any of you listen?\u201dThe Vice-principal appeared a little uneasy as he raised his hand to touch his forehead. He said, \u201cBut you didn\u2019t make yourself clear, so I took Wei Mingzhe\u2019s side\u2026 Sigh! Forget it. There\u2019s no point arguing over it now.\u201dThen a thought crossed the Vice-principal\u2019s mind, and he continued to speak. \u201cNow that the air is cleared, there is no need to tell the Principal about it. He\u2019ll be caught up with a lot of work after he returns to the capital, so let\u2019s not kick a fuss about it.\u201dThe Dean\u2019s lips curled up in slight ridicule. Only now did the Vice-principal want to keep it from the Principal. What had he been doing all along?\u201cEven if I don\u2019t report it to him, the Principal will still find out after he returns.\u201dThe Vice-principal waved his hand impatiently and said, \u201cLet\u2019s take things one step at a time. It\u2019s just a minor misunderstanding and not such a big deal.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71: Did She Cheat?All the students quickly took out their phones to check the preliminary test results, including even those who did not sign up for the quiz.Everyone was eager to know Huo Yao\u2019s grades since she had gotten into the school through the backdoor. They were wondering whether she managed to score even 10 to 20 points.But everyone\u2019s jaws dropped the moment they caught sight of the results.[Darn, the new transfer is incredible! She surprisingly got full marks.][I feel that something\u2019s wrong with my eyes. Didn\u2019t they say she pulled connections to get in?][If someone with full marks needs to get in through the backdoor, then how could we have gotten in when we took the admission exam fair and square?][Maybe she cheated? Those who can get into the school using a backdoor are well connected. Maybe she obtained the preliminary test questions beforehand. Moreover, how could she have gotten all the science questions right if she is a humanities student?][Just thinking about it terrifies me!]Everyone kept talking about it incessantly. Most of the students were dumbstruck by her score. The class split evenly into two factions about whether or not she had cheated.When Huo Yao returned to the classroom, she sensed all sorts of complicated looks from her classmates.\u201cSister Big Shot, were you called into the office to talk about your grades?\u201d Meng Ying had a gossipy look on her face.Huo Yao raised her brow. She did not explain anything to her and merely acknowledged it with an ambiguous nod.\u201cYou are so good at hiding the truth. Your grades were so good that you scored full marks in the test!\u201d said Meng Ying as she smacked her lips.\u201cA humanities student managed to finish the test with a perfect score. Very impressive! Very impressive of you!\u201dHuo Yao looked at her. Then she smiled and said, \u201cThat\u2019s why I told you to read more.\u201dMeng Ying was at a loss for words. She felt that Huo Yao was teasing again.Right then, another thought crossed Meng Ying\u2019s mind. She went up to Huo Yao\u2019s desk and reached inside to retrieve the books that Huo Yao often read.Those were physics, chemistry, and biology books.Meng Ying blinked and asked her quizzically. \u201cAre these the books you keep reading after school?\u201dHuo Yao raised her brow and replied in a flat tone. \u201cOr should I read, \u2018Dating a Domineering CEO\u2019?\u201d\u201cPFFFT\u2026\u201d Meng Ying could not restrain herself from choking. It was a real blow to her.Meng Ying always thought Huo Yao had been reading humanities books after school, but\u2026 she dropped such a bombshell!No wonder Huo Yao loaned her chemistry books to Meng Ying on the first day of school. She had actually been studying both arts and sciences the whole time!Meng Ying shook her head and said, \u201cSister Big Shot, you\u2019re crazy.\u201dHuo Yao\u2019s mouth twitched.\u201cLet\u2019s see if anyone still dares to say you got in through the back door,\u201d muttered Meng Ying proudly with a smug look on her face.People, Sister Big Shot\u2019s well-versed in both arts and sciences. Jealous bitches should get out of the way!**Lu Xia did not attend school today. She was scheduled to go on a shoot and had taken pre-approved leave from the school. She was so occupied during the filming that she did not even check the preliminary test results.But her agent knew that she had taken part in the National Quiz Contest, so he helped keep an eye on it. Shortly after rehearsals, the agent handed her the phone with her score and rank.\u201cXiaxia, you did well on the test and scored 138 points. You sure are a star student. You\u2019re incredible,\u201d said the agent as he smiled brightly.He had already started contemplating in his heart about using the National Quiz Contest to help increase Lu Xia\u2019s hype.After all, there were very few celebrities in the industry with solid family background, good looks, and true intelligence. If he ingeniously publicized Lu Xia\u2019s virtues, nothing would stop her from becoming a big hit!Lu Xia smiled as she took her agent\u2019s phone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72: The Only One With Full MarksLu Xia was fairly confident about her scores. She had been only unsure about a few art related questions but the rest were fine. Hence, she foresaw no problem passing the preliminary test.Coming in 6th with 138 marks was within her expectations.Lu Xia\u2019s lips turned up. She glanced swiftly at her results before handing the phone back to her agent. But a thought crossed her mind, and she pulled her hand back. Then she scrolled down the webpage.By now, she had reached the bottom of the ranking page, but Huo Yao\u2019s name was nowhere to be seen.Lu Xia frowned. Did Huo Yao not take the quiz? Where was her name?Did she\u2026 fail the preliminary test?The smile on Lu Xia\u2019s face deepened. She just knew Huo Yao could not have passed the test with rotten grades like hers.Lu Xia sneered but accidentally pressed the icon to go to the top of the page. That\u2019s when Huo Yao\u2019s name shockingly came into her sight as she lowered her eyes to close the webpage.1st \u2013 150 marks \u2013 Huo Yao.The smile on Lu Xia\u2019s face froze. The grip on her phone tightened.How could this be? How could she have scored full marks? How could she have come first?\u201cXiaxia, why do you look unwell? Were the rehearsals exhausting?\u201d The agent looked at her in concern. He could clearly see that something was amiss with Lu Xia\u2019s expression.Lu Xia\u2019s eyes glinted. Then she handed the phone back to her agent as though nothing had happened and said gently, \u201cI\u2019m fine. I was probably too engrossed in my performance earlier and am still preoccupied with it.\u201dThe agent patted her shoulder when he heard that. He said, \u201cHave a good rest. I\u2019ll come in and get you when the official filming starts.\u201d\u201cMhm, thanks, Brother Tian,\u201d replied Lu Xia gently.The agent took the phone and was about to leave when he paused. Then he turned back and looked at Lu Xia and said, \u201cOh yes, Xiaxia. They will ask you some questions later. I will get the director to ask you about the quiz as well. Just answer them accordingly, haha.\u201dLu Xia blankly stared before he nodded.**Huo Yao had performed brilliantly in the quiz and made it into the city level heats with full marks. She was also the only person with full marks amongst the dozens of middle schools in City S.Not only did Huo Yao come in first on the National Quiz Contest ranking, but her score had a gap of a substantial 9 point margin from the first runner-up. This showed how solid her grasp on both arts and sciences was.Meanwhile, at the local Education Association\u2026\u201cSomeone from No.1 Middle School scored full marks in the preliminary test. Surprisingly, she managed to solve Zhang\u2019s tricky physics question. She must be pretty impressive.\u201dThe Secretary-General exclaimed in admiration as he handed the test paper to the Chairman.The Chairman adjusted his spectacles before he lowered his eyes to look at it.\u201cHer handwriting is pretty good. It looks majestic, confident, and powerful with clean lines. I can tell that she is a highly cultivated student,\u201d commented the Chairman generously.\u201cSince she\u2019s a humanities student, she must be possessing greater literary talent than the science students,\u201d said the Secretary-General with a smile.The Chairman raised his brow with a look of shock on his face as he said, \u201cAre you sure? Did a humanities student solve Zhang\u2019s question?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73: Did She Get It Right By Coincidence?\u201cThat\u2019s why I said she was impressive,\u201d replied the Secretary-General with a profound look in his eyes.The Chairman went quiet for a few seconds before he continued to read the test sheet. He especially focused on the tough physics question, which Zhang had personally prepared.A long while later, the Chairman smiled with great admiration on his face while leaning into his seat.He sighed and said, \u201cShe\u2019s genuinely impressive. Just look at how ingeniously the equation was answered. There isn\u2019t a single unnecessary step in it. Also, this method of solving the question is very novel. It\u2019s even simpler than the answer that Zhang gave us.\u201dAlthough the Secretary-General was not an expert in physics, he saw the excellent logic which the student had used, after he heard the Chairman say so.He collected himself and said, \u201cZhang always wanted to find himself a disciple with unsurpassable talent in physics. Shall we recommend the top scorer from No.1 Middle School to him?\u201dThe Chairman removed his glasses and rubbed the corners of his eyes. After a brief silence, he replied. \u201cNot yet. Since it\u2019s just a preliminary test, it\u2019s too early to tell. After all, the top scorer is an art student. What if it was sheer coincidence that she solved Zhang\u2019s question?\u201dThe Secretary-General felt that his words made sense, so he said, \u201cAlright. Let\u2019s see how she fares at the city level heats then.\u201d\u201cMhm,\u201d replied the Chairman gently. Then he placed the answer script on the table.The Secretary-General glanced at the answer script again and said, \u201cShall we take a picture of the answer for the physics question and send it to Zhang? I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be\u2026\u201dThe Chairman raised his head and interrupted him. \u201cZhang already did the Education Association a huge favor by taking time from his busy schedule to help us come up with the question. Questions like this mean nothing to him, so there\u2019s really no need to kick a fuss about it.\u201dThe Secretary-General touched his nose and replied politely. \u201cOkay, I got it. Then let me archive the answer script.\u201d\u201cGo on.\u201dAs soon as the Secretary-General turned to leave, the Chairman suddenly remembered something and asked the Secretary-General from behind. \u201cOh yes. There\u2019s a girl called Lu Xia from the No.1 Middle School who signed up for the test as well. How did she fare?\u201dThe Secretary-General halted in his steps. He remembered Lu Xia\u2019s name because his daughter was her fan.The Secretary-General turned to reply to his boss. \u201cShe scored 138 marks and came in 6th, so she did quite well.\u201dThen he added the next sentence as an afterthought. \u201cI think this student is a campus star who specializes in science. She\u2019s quite talented for doing so well in different fields of life.\u201dThe Chairman tapped his fingertips on the table gently and replied. \u201cSure, okay. Carry on with your work.\u201dThe Secretary-General glanced at the Chairman. Although he was unclear why the Chairman suddenly asked about Lu Xia, he did not probe any further and left.***On Saturday.Shortly after breakfast, Song Ning dragged Huo Yao off to the supermarket near their estate and bought a lot of groceries and snacks.After paying the bill, Song Ning suddenly giggled out loud when she turned around to see her daughter looking miserable with her hands full.Song Ning extended her hand to help with the bags and said, \u201cGirls shouldn\u2019t stay at home all the time. You should come out for some fun too. If you keep staying at home to study, you will end up being a nerd.\u201dHuo Yao turned down her mother\u2019s offer to help expressionlessly and exposed her mother in a blunt manner. \u201cYou\u2019re just saying this because you needed someone to carry your shopping bags.\u201dSong Ning coughed sheepishly. When she saw how effortlessly Huo Yao carried the two bags, she knew there was no way this was the delicate and sweet daughter which she had imagined her to be.Huo Yao glanced at the grocery bag in her hand and asked her mother. \u201cAre we expecting guests today?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74: So You Are His Baby SisterSong Ning replied with a slight look of mystery on her face. \u201cWell, he\u2019s not considered a guest!\u201dHuo Yao raised her brow and asked her. \u201cIs it Lu Xia?\u201dAlthough Lu Xia had already gone back to the Lu family, the Huo family probably did not treat her as an outsider.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not her,\u201d replied Song Ning as she shook her head and smiled.\u201cWhy did you suddenly think it was Xiaxia?\u201dHuo Yao replied in a nonchalant manner. \u201cA wild guess.\u201dIt was very crowded at the supermarket entrance, so Huo Yao did not want to continue with this conversation. Instead, she said, \u201cLet\u2019s head back home first.\u201dThen she walked out with the two big bags in her hands.Song Ning gazed at her slender but strong daughter from behind and sighed, thinking of the image of a delicate and tender girl in her heart.Song Ning hurried into the kitchen after they got home and started to cook.Huo Yao glanced at her thoughtfully before heading back to her room.The Huo family\u2019s doorbell finally rang at 6:30 pm.\u201cYaoyao, go get the door,\u201d shouted Song Ning from inside the kitchen as she was too busy.Huo Yao acknowledged her and put her phone into her pocket before getting up to answer the door.Shortly after the door opened\u2026\u201cAunt\u2026 Did I get the wrong door?\u201dThe man at the door was halfway through saying, \u2018Aunt\u2019. When he saw Huo Yao, he swiftly swallowed the word.Huo Yao frowned and enquired. \u201cHmm?\u201dThe man had a lot of things in his hands. He stepped back and looked up at the unit number on the doorframe and said, \u201cI was right\u2026\u201dHe looked at Huo Yao and was overwhelmed by her stunning good looks. Then he cleared his throat and asked her quizzically. \u201cIs this the Huos\u2019 residence?\u201d\u201cYes, it is,\u201d replied Huo Yao coolly with barely any expression on her exquisite face.Even her voice was lovely.Although\u2026 this girl was unfamiliar, she somewhat resembled his artist on closer scrutiny.The man\u2019s eyes froze. Something suddenly dawned on his face. He said with surprise in his voice, \u201cAre you Xiang\u2019s biological little sister? The one who was taken away by another family at birth?\u201dSince he was acquainted with Lu Xia, it was not hard to figure out who this girl was.Huo Yao looked at him indifferently without saying a word.She had good looks, a beautiful voice, and gave off a cool vibe. She did not resemble someone brought up in the countryside.A look of surprise flitted across Tong Yu\u2019s eyes. Then he quickly introduced himself. \u201cHi Huo Yao. I\u2019m your brother, Huo Xiang\u2019s agent. My name is Tong Yu.\u201dHuo Yao seemed surprised to hear that. Had her mother been busy cooking in the kitchen all day because the mystery guest she was expecting today, was Huo Xiang?The fourth elder brother of the owner of this body?Huo Yao glanced at Tong Yu. Since he was Huo Xiang\u2019s agent, did this mean the fourth brother, whom she had never laid eyes on, was a celebrity?As Huo Yao sized Tong Yu up, he almost instinctively straightened his back. Although Huo Yao was a young girl, she made him feel inexplicably tense. It was mind-boggling!Huo Yao gathered her thoughts before she pursed her lips and bowed. She said politely, \u201cHow do you do!\u201dThen she opened the main door wide and let him in.Tong Yu composed his thoughts but did not enter the apartment. Instead, he placed a paper bag inside the doorway.He smiled as he said, \u201cI won\u2019t be coming in. I came to help Xiang drop some gifts. I\u2019ll be off now.\u201dThe moment Huo Yao heard him say this, her expression turned slightly cold. Then she spuriously smiled and asked him. \u201cIs he not coming back tonight?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75: Wasn\u2019t That Your Fourth Elder Brother?Tong Yu had been working in the entertainment industry for over a decade. Over the years, he had become one of the top agents in the trade, so he was particularly observant.Despite Huo Yao\u2019s smile, Tong Yu could sense the coldness emanating from her. At first, he wanted to nod and agree, but he unexpectedly changed his words and replied. \u201cHe\u2019s held up at work. Some changes need to be done for the movie which he filmed abroad recently, so he headed to the office right after he got off the plane.\u201dTong Yu continued to speak after a brief pause. \u201cXiang especially told me to send the presents over first when he found out you were back. When he\u2019s done with work, he will probably come over.\u201dHuo Yao twitched her lips and said calmly, \u201cGot it. Thanks.\u201dTong Yu scratched his head and asked her. \u201cI\u2019m heading back to the office. Do you have any message for him?\u201dHuo Yao had turned to go back into the apartment. When she heard Tong Yu\u2019s words, she glanced towards the kitchen. She turned her head to the side and looked at him. \u201cPlease tell him that Mom went to the supermarket first thing in the morning and bought all his favorite food.\u201dTong Yu was speechless. By the time he gathered his thoughts and wanted to speak up, Huo Yao had already closed the door.The smile on his face dissipated a while later and was replaced by a look of woe. He sighed before turning to head towards the lift.**Song Ning came out of the kitchen with a spatula in hand, beaming brightly. But when she saw it was just Huo Yao, she was surprised. \u201cWho was at the door, Yao? Is Xiang home?\u201dHuo Yao placed the paper bag in the cabinet by the doorway and replied calmly. \u201cNo, it was his agent.\u201dThere was a slight look of disappointment on Song Ning\u2019s face as she said, \u201cSo Xiang won\u2019t be coming home today?\u201dHuo Yao glanced at her and replied softly. \u201cHe\u2019s held up at the office.\u201d\u201cSigh, okay then!\u201d said Song Ning.Suddenly she became angry as she turned towards the kitchen. \u201cI should have objected when he wanted to join the entertainment industry. He barely gets any rest. His biological sister has come back since long. No matter how busy he is, he should have come home to visit by now.\u201dHuo Yao merely smiled ambiguously.**Meanwhile, on the other side\u2026After Tong Yu drove out of the Huo family\u2019s estate, he did not head back to the office. Instead, he went to a posh villa located downtown.Tong Yu swiped the key card and entered. He placed the key on the cabinet at the doorway before changing into indoor slippers. Then he poured a glass of water and headed upstairs.\u201cI saw your biological sister when I visited your place just now. She\u2019s gorgeous and resembles you a lot.\u201dAfter Tong Yu entered the master bedroom, he said to the man lying in bed.The man seemed to have no reaction whatsoever. He remained motionless as though he were asleep.Tong Yu sighed. He walked up to the bedside to turn on the table lamp and said once more, \u201cYour little sister is probably hoping you\u2019d go back to see her. She asked me to give you a message before I left.\u201dThe man in bed suddenly pulled the blanket off after not reacting for a long time. A face bearing a strong similarity to Huo Yao emerged from beneath.Huo Xiang\u2019s hair was disheveled. He had a slovenly demeanor, and his handsome face seemed depressed. He looked at Tong Yu gloomily and sounded harsh as he said to Tong Yu, \u201cYou\u2019re so irritating! What\u2019s the point of telling me that? Don\u2019t you know that I\u2019m\u2026\u201dHuo Xiang smiled with slight self-ridicule. Then he said dejectedly, \u201cLeave. Don\u2019t ever come looking for me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76: I Am UselessWhen Tong Yu finally saw Huo Xiang react, he was unperturbed. He seemed accustomed to the way Huo Xiang spoke, with rage in his voice. Tong Yu handed him the glass of water.Then he said heavy heartedly, \u201cHuo Xiang, how long are you going to continue living like this?\u201dHuo Xiang stared at the ceiling. Suddenly, his downcast eyes swiftly changed their expression and became as still as dead water.A long while later, he said bitterly, \u201cI can\u2019t perform anymore, and it\u2019s as good as getting a death sentence. I\u2019m useless now. Don\u2019t you get it?\u201dTong Yu parted his lips. He was speechless as he could only sympathize with Huo Xiang.He had almost single-handedly groomed Huo Xiang. Huo Xiang was exceptionally talented whether it was music production, song, or dance. It was as though Huo Xiang was born for the stage.It must have come as a deadly shock for someone as proud as Huo Xiang to hurt his spine during an accident.\u201cHuo Xiang, don\u2019t give up. Medicine is really advanced these days, so someone is bound to be able to fix your injury,\u201d said Tong Yu with a dry feeling in his throat.There was nothing else he could do except comfort him.\u201cHeh\u2026\u201d Huo Xiang laughed gently. Then he closed his eyes and turned his head to the side without saying another word to Tong Yu.Tong Yu smiled weakly before placing the glass of water on the bedside table. He raised his head and gathered his thoughts before turning for the door.But he recalled what Huo Yao had told him before he left the Huos, so he halted.He tilted his head to the side and said softly, \u201cYour baby sister has a message for you. Your mother went grocery shopping first thing in the morning and bought all your favorite things.\u201dA few seconds later, Tong Yu seemed to come to a decision and continued. \u201cHuo Xiang, I don\u2019t ever want to help you lie to your parents again\u2026 Also, I didn\u2019t tell your little sister that you weren\u2019t going back tonight. It\u2019s up to you whether to go or not. I\u2019m off now.\u201dThe sound of the door shutting came from the doorway.It became very quiet in the room. Almost eerily quiet.Huo Xiang opened his eyes. There was a complicated look in his eyes as he clenched his fists tightly. Then he pulled up the blanket in frustration and covered even his head with it.Ten minutes later.Huo Xiang suddenly lifted the blanket and sat up. Then he cursed softly before finally getting off the bed.***At 8:00 pmSong Ning sat on the couch and checked the wall clock while she glanced at the door once again. Although she did not say a word, her anxiety was visibly evident.Huo Yao sat lazily beside her on the couch. Her eyes and fingers were busy playing on her phone.\u201cYaoyao, you must be famished. Why don\u2019t you go ahead and eat?\u201d Song Ning said as she turned around to look at her obedient daughter.Huo Yao put away her phone and said casually, \u201cMaybe Brother Xiang is caught up with work and won\u2019t be coming tonight.\u201dSong Ning only smiled and shook her head with a look of certainty. She said, \u201cAlthough Xiang is usually too busy to come home, he never lies. If his agent said he would come today, then he would definitely turn up.\u201dIf Huo Xiang was intending to come home, he would not have sent gifts with his agent.There was a calm look on Huo Yao\u2019s face. She wanted to say more but when she saw the confidence Song Ning had in Huo Xiang, she chose to stay quiet.The doorbell rang before long.\u201cIt must be Xiang,\u201d said Song Ning as she quickly stood up to answer the door.Huo Yao raised her brows. There was a look of surprise in her bright and beautiful eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She said, \u201cXiang, this is your biological sister, Yaoyao.\u201dHuo Xiang turned to look in her direction.The girl was pretty and had defined features while her fair face was radiant and translucent under the light. Her loose T-shirt was paired with casual home wear shorts, and her legs were slender and straight. She was far more stunning than any other model or celebrity that he had seen in the entertainment industry.Although she had a laid back appearance, Huo Yao looked unaffected and confident. She did not appear delicate or meek like the other girls usually did.Huo Xiang had not felt too strongly about his biological sister, despite Tong Yu saying wonderful things about her. After all, they grew up in entirely different environments, and he did not like meek girls.Now that they met for the first time, she exceeded his expectations. For what it was worth, he did not dislike her on the first look.3Huo Xiang\u2019s habitually cold face warmed up a little.Huo Yao also blatantly studied him while he was sizing her up.Huo Xiang did not appear to be as Huo Yao had imagined and had undoubtedly inherited the family\u2019s good looking genes. Yet judging from the way he acted when he got his agent to send gifts this afternoon, she had surmised that he was an arrogant person.In all honesty, Huo Xiang was proud, but it was purely inherent and unintentional.People usually had such temperament because they were highly competent and did not have to ingratiate themselves with anyone.Huo Yao was surely surprised. She found it inconceivable for Huo Xiang to deviate so far from her initial impression which she had formed about him this afternoon.Why had Huo Yao never seen Huo Xiang in advertisements, given his imposing aura and celebrity status?Was he not famous in reality?Huo Yao stopped staring at him curiously. Then she greeted him calmly and politely. \u201cBrother Xiang.\u201d\u201cMhm, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re back,\u201d said Huo Xiang as he nodded with a cool expression on his face.He paused for a moment before a thought crossed his mind. He suddenly said in an apologetic tone, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I came in such a hurry that I forgot to bring you a gift.\u201dHuo Yao glanced quizzically at the cabinet not far from her.The things that Tong Yu brought in the afternoon were still sitting on the cabinet.1Before she spoke her mind, Song Ning asked him. \u201cHmm? Didn\u2019t your agent come with a lot of gifts earlier this afternoon?\u201dSong Ning had walked up to the cabinet and checked the contents of the paper bag.Huo Xiang\u2019s eyes glinted and he said, \u201cTong Yu picked those. When I have the time, I will personally pick a gift for my little sister.\u201dSong Ning was rather surprised to hear that.Huo Xiang had an eccentric personality and was lofty, indifferent, and arrogant. Despite growing up together with Lu Xia, he had barely paid her any attention.Song Ning had been worried that it would be tougher for her other sons to get along with Huo Yao, especially her youngest boy since Huo Yanxi had developed a bias against her early on. But from the looks of it right now, Huo Xiang seemed to have a good impression of Huo Yao.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. There\u2019s no need to go through the trouble of picking a gift for me,\u201d said Huo Yao as she turned him down politely.Huo Xiang frowned and seemed unwilling to accept her refusal. After contemplating for a few seconds, he retrieved his phone from his pocket and said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure what you like either. Why don\u2019t I give you some money, and you can buy something yourself instead?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although he did not despise his biological sister for growing up in the countryside, he was afraid that she might be an unrequired burden. Hence, he never texted her even though he could.Since Huo Xiang had added a remark to Huo Yao\u2019s nickname previously, he quickly found and opened their dialog box. Then he tapped several times and entered a sum on the fund transfer page.\u201cThe daily transfer limit is two hundred thousand, so just take this for now. I\u2019ll send you more money tomorrow. Buy whatever you like and call me for more,\u201d Huo Xiang told her indifferently.2Huo Yao could hear a notification alert coming from her phone in her pocket. It felt as though she was being flooded with huge sums of money again.She went speechless, \u201c\u2026\u201dWas this a genetic thing?1It absolutely must be!Huo Yao pressed her forehead without bothering to retrieve her phone. Huo Xiang\u2019s voice floated out when she was about to turn him down. \u201cIf you don\u2019t accept it, I\u2019ll assume you are still pissed at me and not planning to forgive me.\u201dHuo Yao, \u201c\u2026\u201d1The way this family forced money on Huo Yao sounded utterly identical.2-_-||Huo Yao remained in a daze until dinner after she was forced to accept the large sum of money.There was a definite deviation from her initial impression that the Huo family was poor. Huo Xiang\u2019s shocking actions on their first meeting itself had made it clear that they were anything but poor.\u201cYaoyao, what\u2019s on your mind? Why do you look so preoccupied?\u201d asked Song Ning concernedly as she sat next to her.The girl seemed lost in thought ever since dinner started, and it was the first time Song Ning had seen her like that.Huo Yao gathered her thoughts and shook her head slightly. In a complicated voice, she said, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dHuo Xiang glanced at her. The girl\u2019s face still appeared a little distracted. Perhaps it was due to their blood bond that he found his little sister\u2019s expression adorable while he usually thought it as obnoxious on others.Shortly after, his father said, \u201cXiang, why don\u2019t you stay for a little longer this time? Work is important, but you have to rest too.\u201dHuo Xiang tightened his grip on the chopsticks when he heard this as he suppressed the look in his eyes. His handsome face seemed almost normal.He said calmly, \u201cI can\u2019t. My schedule is completely packed this year. I have to fly to City B to film a MV. Time is really tight.\u201dPost that, he lowered his head and ate.\u201cYou insisted on becoming a singer, but look at how overworked you are now. Look at how much weight you have lost this time,\u201d said Song Ning in a heartbroken voice.When Huo Xiang swallowed the rice in his mouth, it seemed to taste bitter. He looked up a few seconds later with a smile on his face and replied to his mother. \u201cEven better if I\u2019m skinnier. I need to lose weight for filming.\u201dSong Ning shook her head helplessly and said, \u201cAt your age, you should take care of yourself!\u201dHuo Xiang smiled dejectedly.When Huo Yao raised her head, she was just in time to catch the strange expression on his face. Although it seemed natural, there was something off.Despite the doubts hovering in Huo Yao\u2019s mind, she did not probe him.Everyone had their secrets.*Huo Xiang hung out in the living room for 30 minutes after dinner before making an excuse to leave.\u201cI have a nagging feeling that there\u2019s something wrong with Xiang,\u201d said Song Ning with a frown on her face after he left.Since men were not as observant as women, Huo Jinyan merely patted Song Ning\u2019s hand and consoled her. \u201cHe\u2019s probably too tired. Didn\u2019t he just return from overseas today?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the past, Xiang used to stay back for at least some time whenever he came back. But he seemed determined not to linger on even for a little while this time,\u201d said Song Ning sternly.Since Huo Yao had already returned to her room, Song Ning continued to speak freely. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t seem to get along with Yaoyao, I would have thought he didn\u2019t want to be here because of her.\u201dBut that was clearly not the case.Huo Jinyan pondered over it for a few seconds and then said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we call Tong Yu over tomorrow and ask him?\u201dSong Ning nodded and agreed readily. \u201cSounds good. Or else I will keep feeling worried.\u201d\u201cStop thinking about it.\u201d**Huo Yao took a shower after she went back to her room. Then she sat down in front of the computer and ran a search for Huo Xiang on her internet browser.Many search results turned up very quickly, but none of them were related to the biological big brother of this body.Huo Yao touched her chin. Was Huo Xiang really not famous?After contemplating briefly, she swiftly entered a website address, and a new webpage loaded. She quickly entered the Cloud Realm website after verifying the two-factor authentication.Huo Yao opened her list of friends and sent an instant message to someone who\u2019s nickname was Prophet.Bold Little Darling: [Are you online? Help me check on someone.]Although Prophet was online, he was probably occupied as Huo Yao did not promptly hear back from him.Huo Yao patiently waited as she lazily leaned back into her chair. The light from the computer screen flickered and reflected onto her face, making made her seem even more nonchalant.After five to six minutes of waiting, Prophet finally turned up.Prophet: [My bad, I was busy. Who do you want me to investigate?]Huo Yao was ready to type on the keyboard, but her phone suddenly rang, startling her.Her hands paused. She looked sideways and glanced at the caller ID on the screen.Min Yu?Huo Yao was puzzled. Why was Min Yu calling her at this hour of the night?She picked up the phone and answered it after brief consideration.A minute later, Huo Yao replied. \u201cOk, I\u2019ll be there real soon.\u201dBy the time Huo Yao was done with the call, her expression had turned quite grave.Her fingertips moved a little as she looked at the dialog box.She swiftly wrote: [Talk again. I have an emergency on my hands. Going offline.]She closed the webpage without waiting for a reply and stood up to grab a jacket from her wardrobe before quickly walking out.Huo Jinyan and Song Ning had already retired to their room to rest, so Huo Yao picked up the house keys and left the place without disturbing them.20 minutes later, at the hospital.Huo Yao spotted Min Yu standing at the hospital\u2019s main entrance shortly after she got off the cab. She walked over and said a little gravely, \u201cHow\u2019s Grandma?\u201dMin Yu replied calmly as he brought her in. \u201cShe\u2019s out of danger.\u201dHuo Yao heaved a sigh of relief when she heard him. The look of anxiety on her face eased up a little. She turned to glance at him and said in a sincere tone, \u201cThanks. Fortunately, you were around.\u201dMin Yu pursed his lips. His exquisite features were filled with warmth under the light. He replied with a quiet smile. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201dVery quickly, the two of them walked over to the hospital ward.The old lady had already been transferred to a regular ward from the emergency department. The doctor on duty was monitoring her physical indicators inside the room.Huo Yao stood outside instead of entering the ward immediately. She quietly looked at her grandmother through the window with a profound look in her eyes and went into deep thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seemed like she suddenly changed into a completely different person.He tried to console her. \u201cYour grandmother will be fine.\u201dHuo Yao replied with a small nod. Her long eyelashes cast a shadow over her eyes as she lowered them. She was calm and not anxious.Very quickly, the hospital ward door opened.Huo Yao looked up and entered the place quietly.The doctor removed his mask and looked at Huo Yao and Min Yu sternly. He reprimanded them in a severe voice. \u201cShe\u2019s okay for now but can\u2019t you youngsters watch your temper when she\u2019s around? Her heart is weak, and she can\u2019t afford to get agitated again and again.\u201dHuo Yao\u2019s eyes glinted for a second but she replied with both humility and modesty. \u201cI understand. We will be more careful.\u201dPerhaps due to her politeness in response to his suggestion, the doctor stopped scolding her. Instead, he said, \u201cGo in and sit with her. Don\u2019t unnerve her again!\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d replied Huo Yao as she bowed slightly. After the doctor and nurse left, she went into the ward.The old lady was yet to regain consciousness. Her mouth was covered with an oxygen mask and she lay in bed quietly while the data on the apparatus next to her pulsed steadily.Huo Yao glanced calmly at the apparatus. Then she turned to pull up a chair and sat next to the bed.Huo Yao reached out to gently tuck the old lady in after gazing at her for a while. She subtly held the old lady\u2019s wrist by the side of the bed.Min Yu sat down next to her as well. He could only see Huo Yao\u2019s profile and failed to detect her tiny actions.Min Yu\u2019s phone vibrated in his pocket. He veered his eyes away and pulled out his phone. He glanced at the screen before putting the phone back into his pocket.Approximately two minutes later, his phone vibrated once again. This time it was not a notification but a call.Min Yu frowned. He glanced at Huo Yao before getting up to leave the room.He walked out softly without making a sound. Huo Yao turned to look towards the door after it clicked shut. She looked thoughtfully for a second and swung her eyes towards the old lady again.Min Yu came back into the room before long. Huo Yao slowly placed the old lady\u2019s hand back under the blanket. She turned to raise her head and said to Min Yu, \u201cThanks for your help tonight. It\u2019s getting late, you should head back to rest. I can stay with her by myself.\u201dMin Yu raised his brow and said, \u201cNo need to be so formal.\u201dHuo Yao leaned back into the chair lazily. Her exquisite face was not as tense as when she first got to the hospital. She continued to speak in a languid manner. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be polite. Aren\u2019t you busy though?\u201dShe glanced calmly at his phone, which he had yet to place back into his pocket.Min Yu was rather surprised by Huo Yao\u2019s keen sense of observation, but she was right, so he paused before saying, \u201cI might be out of the city for a few days. Call me if you need me.\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d replied Huo Yao promptly as she waved him away. She clearly did not take the matter to heart.Min Yu smiled and said, \u201cSee you.\u201dVery quickly, only Huo Yao and the old lady were left in the hospital ward. After the nurse on duty came to check on the patient one last time, Huo Yao lay prone on the bed and rested her head next to the old lady.*The next day.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although Huo Yao turned up slightly later than usual from her run, Song Ning did not suspect that she had been out all night. She merely presumed Huo Yao ran for a longer time today.Huo Yao did not tell Song Ning about it either. After going back to her room for a quick shower, she changed and took out a box from her wardrobe. She opened it to reveal dozens of bottles and removed a light blue porcelain one from the box.Huo Yao placed the bottle in her bag and went downstairs immediately. She told Song Ning briefly about her grandmother\u2019s situation and rejected their offer to visit her. Then she headed out in a hurry without even eating her breakfast.Huo Yao arrived back at the hospital 20 minutes later.But she caught sight of He Xiaoman, Lu Xia, and an approximately 15 year old boy standing inside the ward\u2019s door. She instinctively halted in her steps looking at them.\u201cMom, why didn\u2019t you tell us about your relapse? If the nanny didn\u2019t call to tell me, I wouldn\u2019t have found out about it,\u201d said He Xiaoman as she rubbed her forehead.She was really upset but did not dare to speak harshly to her mother, considering her condition.Yang Qiuhua sat on the bed with barely any color on her face. She seemed to dislike the people in the room and kept up an indifferent expression.\u201cI\u2019m okay. I don\u2019t need you since there are doctors and nurses here to take care of me. Carry on.\u201dYang Qiuhua did not know when Huo Yao would come back. She was worried that if she bumped into these people, she would end up getting bullied again.When He Xiaoman heard her mother talking like this, she became annoyed and said, \u201cXiaxia and Ziming came to visit you with me the moment we found out you were hospitalized. Do you have to be so unreasonable towards all of us?\u201dYang Qiuhua only looked out of the window without uttering a word.He Xiaoman felt helpless. She found it unfathomable why her mother kept going against her.\u201cMom, calm down. Grandma can\u2019t get upset,\u201d said Lu Xia as she walked up to He Xiaoman and shook her head.Lu Xia turned to look at her grandmother before pulling up a chair nearby to sit by her bedside. Then she held the old lady\u2019s hand and said gently, \u201cGrandma, don\u2019t get upset with Mom. She\u2019s just very concerned about you.\u201dLu Xia\u2019s words helped He Xiaoman calm down a little. Moreover, she was Yang Qiuhua\u2019s biological granddaughter, so Yang Qiuhua was clearly no longer as stiff when she turned to look at Lu Xia but she still remained indifferent.\u201cI\u2019m fine. Take your mother and brother with you and leave,\u201d said Yang Qiuhua as she subtly pulled her hand out from her grasp.Lu Xia withdrew her hand but continued persuading Yang Qiuhua gently. \u201cHow can doctors and nurses do a better job of caring for you than your family?\u201dYang Qiuhua became instinctively agitated the moment she heard Lu Xia, so she retorted. \u201cBut I don\u2019t need it. I have Yao\u2026\u201d She realized midway that she had almost slipped up and swiftly held her tongue.Unfortunately, He Xiaoman already caught on and asked her furiously. \u201cAre you hoping that Huo Yao will come?\u201dYang Qiuhua looked elsewhere and replied in a casual manner. \u201cSo what if I do? You were such a bully towards her the last time!\u201dHe Xiaoman angrily laughed as she said, \u201cMe? A bully? Don\u2019t you know why I chased her away?\u201dBut right after, she changed the subject and continued. \u201cFine. Since you\u2019re so protective of her, then tell me does she know you\u2019re sick? Did she come to the hospital to take care of you?\u201dHe Xiaoman pointed at Lu Xia and said, \u201cNo, she didn\u2019t. Take a close look. Xiaxia is the one visiting you and taking care of you. She\u2019s your real granddaughter!\u201d1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lu Xia stood up at that moment and tugged at He Xiaoman\u2019s arm and said, \u201cMom, calm down. Since Grandma wants Huo Yao to take care of her, then we can call her over. Although Huo Yao isn\u2019t Grandma\u2019s biological granddaughter, they must have feelings for each other after living together for so long. Don\u2019t get into a fight with Grandma on my account. We should focus on Grandma\u2019s recovery instead.\u201dLu Xia forcibly smiled before she turned to retrieve her phone from the purse.He Xiaoman felt even angrier when she heard her daughter. Seeing Lu Xia with her phone, she swiftly snatched it from her hand.\u201cWhy are you calling her? Why are you so stubborn? You came here to take care of your grandmother after skipping an important official event. Why do you have to call that girl over? Are you na\u00efve or plain stupid?\u201d He Xiaoman asked her disappointedly.\u201cMom, it\u2019s okay\u2026\u201d replied Lu Xia as she attempted to take her phone back. But when she looked up, she saw Huo Yao standing at the doorway. She was stunned.The moment He Xiaoman detected something amiss with Lu Xia\u2019s expression, she glanced towards the door as well. She was caught by surprise too but she quickly composed herself and spoke with her face downcast. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dYang Qiuhua had spotted Huo Yao as well and looked at her anxiously. She was unsure about how much of their conversation Huo Yao had heard. Out of fear that there might be a misunderstanding, Yang Qiuhua hurriedly said, \u201cYaoyao stayed with me all through the night.\u201d\u201cAll night?\u201d He Xiaoman asked as she turned to look at the old lady with a look of disbelief on her face.\u201cMom, are you saying this to help her? If she stayed with you all night, why didn\u2019t you say so earlier?\u201dNow it was clear that Yang Qiuhua was hiding something from her daughter.\u201cWould you have believed me if I did? Would it change your mind about chasing Yaoyao away?\u201d Yang Qiuhua muttered almost to herself.Yang Qiuhua merely wanted to convince them to leave before Huo Yao got here. She did not expect Huo Yao to come back so quickly.When He Xiaoman heard her mother, she couldn\u2019t help but use a self-deprecating tone. \u201cAm I such a terrible daughter to you?\u201dYang Qiuhua averted her eyes and did not want to respond.\u201cMom,\u201d interrupted Lu Xia at this moment. She shook her head at He Xiaoman before quickly walking over to the door to pull Huo Yao in.In a pleasant tone, she said, \u201cYaoyao, come on in quickly. Grandma has been waiting for you.\u201dHuo Yao glanced at Lu Xia indifferently and avoided her hand. She walked into the hospital ward before Lu Xia could touch her. Huo Yao went straight to the old lady\u2019s bedside without saying anything to He Xiaoman, either.She looked at her grandmother and said rather calmly, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you not to get angry? Are you misbehaving again?\u201dYang Qiuhua gazed at Huo Yao\u2019s calm face and subconsciously cringed. She muttered softly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t getting agitated. I\u2019m okay.\u201dHuo Yao cast her a thoughtful smile and said, \u201cIf you were fine, you wouldn\u2019t have suffered a relapse last night.\u201dYang Qiuhua did not dare to speak any further and looked at her meekly.She was unafraid of anyone throwing a temper at her, except for Huo Yao.Lu Xia lowered her eyes and clenched her fists when she witnessed this scene. No matter how well she performed in front of the old lady, it seemed Yang Qiuhua did not give a damn about her.Lu Xia genuinely loathed Huo Yao.Lu Ziming had been quietly playing with his phone all this time without saying a word, but he suddenly looked up at Huo Yao and a look of surprise surfaced in his eyes.Was this still that stupid and cowardly big sister of his?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since a young age, he had always been a bright child. In the Lu family, almost everyone pampered him dearly. Hence, he developed a willful personality and treated everyone rudely. He was now a classic arrogant and ill-bred young man from a rich and powerful family.Lu Ziming and Huo Yao had barely seen each other since they did not grow up together. When He Xiaoman occasionally sent for Huo Yao to come home during the Chinese New Year, the willful Lu Ziming would take the opportunity to bully and frame her.Most of the members of the Lu family detested Huo Yao because of Lu Ziming.\u201cHey, you coward. Why didn\u2019t you greet me when you came in?\u201d asked Lu Ziming arrogantly as he placed his phone in his pocket.Huo Yao did not even bother to look in his direction. She merely turned around to take a clean glass and poured some water in it. Then she put the medicine she brought from home into the glass at an angle which was hidden from everyone.Lu Ziming walked around the table to reach Huo Yao. He said, \u201cHey, I\u2019m talking to you! Are you deaf?\u201dLu Xia\u2019s lips twitched when she witnessed this. She appeared to eagerly wait for Lu Ziming to make trouble for Huo Yao.The glass swirled in Huo Yao\u2019s hand for a moment. Then she turned around as though Lu Ziming was not there and handed the water to the old lady. She said, \u201cDrink some water.\u201dLu Ziming was terribly annoyed about being ignored. He raised his hand to snatch the glass from Huo Yao just as his grandmother was about to take it and said, \u201cLu Yao, how dare you\u2026\u201dBut suddenly Lu Ziming sensed a pain on his wrist before he could finish his sentence. He was swiftly yanked so hard that he staggered and fell on the ground. When he looked up to see Huo Yao\u2019s frosty eyes, he instinctively shivered.\u201cDidn\u2019t your mother teach you any manners?\u201d asked Huo Yao as she towered over Lu Ziming with a cold light glinting in her deep eyes.Despite her soft tone, a threatening aura radiated from her.Fear ran through Lu Ziming\u2019s heart as though he was a tiger\u2019s prey. Despite the pain in his wrist, it could not compare to the panic that Huo Yao\u2019s eyes were sending to his veins. He mumbled in a trembling tone. \u201cLet\u2026 Let me go.\u201dWhen Huo Yao saw how cowardly Lu Ziming had turned out to be after he was outdone, she sneered at him contemptuously. \u201cDon\u2019t be a bully if you don\u2019t have the guts. You\u2019re such a wimp.\u201dThen she let go of Lu Ziming\u2019s hand.Lu Ziming\u2019s face had turned ghastly pale. There was something hovering at the tip of his tongue as he held his aching wrist, but he did not dare to speak up. It seemed as though he had gotten quite a shock.Lu Xia composed herself and glanced at Lu Ziming before walking over to stand in front of him.She said gently, \u201cHuo Yao, how can you hurt a kid? Lu Ziming used to be your little brother after all!\u201dHuo Yao raised her brow as her eyes landed on Lu Xia\u2019s face. She playfully laughed and said, \u201cAre you acting like a loving sister coming to her little brother\u2019s aid now?\u201dLu Xia frowned. \u201cYou\u2026\u201dLu Ziming shoved Lu Xia aside before she could finish her sentence. He was already incredibly embarrassed by Huo Yao and felt that Lu Xia was only worsening the matter. In the end, he glared at Huo Yao furiously and left the room in a huff.Lu Xia felt somewhat embarrassed by his actions and stood stockstill.Moments later, Lu Ziming came back to the door and said, \u201cMom, why are you still hanging around here? If someone wants to take care of Grandma, then leave her to it.\u201dSaying so, he turned to leave for good without bothering to look back.Since He Xiaoman had always indulged her son, she chased after him, not even stopping to reprimand Huo Yao.Lu Xia was left behind to suffer the mortification all alone in that moment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m not angry. You don\u2019t have to be so nervous.\u201dYang Qiuhua instantly felt relieved. She took a sip of water and realized that it was her usual medication. She could not help looking up at Huo Yao in surprise. \u201cDid you go back to get my medicine?\u201dHuo Yao replied nonchalantly. \u201cMhm.\u201dShe pulled a chair over with her foot and sat down lazily before she continued. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you been taking the medicine which I gave you?\u201dYang Qiuhua tightened her grip on the glass subconsciously. Her eyes wandered around the ward without daring to look straight at Huo Yao as she replied. \u201cI did take them\u2026\u201dHuo Yao smiled ambiguously looking at Yang Qiuhua without saying a word.This smile of Huo Yao\u2019s terrified Yang Qiuhua the most. Although she had already come up with an excuse, she could not bring herself to say it and was defeated by Huo Yao\u2019s imposing presence. She sighed and continued softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t purposely skip the medicine. The pills disappeared.\u201dHuo Yao tapped on the armrest with a look of languor in her eyes. A few seconds later, she said indifferently, \u201cThe Lu family must have taken them.\u201dYang Qiuhua nodded after a long time. She knew it was impossible to hide anything from Huo Yao.\u201cFine, forget about it. Let\u2019s talk about why you suddenly suffered a relapse last night,\u201d said Huo Yao softly. It sounded as though she was talking about something mundane.But Yang Qiuhua knew this nonchalance was a sign that Huo Yao was already very angry. Yang Qiuhua went quiet for a while before she smiled bitterly and said, \u201cI called up Xiaoman because the pills had gone missing. Other than the nanny and me, she was the only other person who might have known about their whereabouts.\u201dDespite her vague response, it was evident what had transpired. Huo Yao rubbed her forehead. She sighed helplessly and said, \u201cYou can call me directly when you run out of the medicine the next time.\u201dYang Qiuhua hung her head and concealed the sadness in her eyes.Huo Yao did not badger her any longer. Instead, she changed the subject and asked her in confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with Min Yu? Why did he end up sending you to the hospital last night?\u201dYang Qiuhua was surprised by how Huo Yao addressed him. But she replied with a nod. \u201cI might have accidentally dialed his number when I had a relapse. Little Mr. Min is such a kind man. You must give him my thanks.\u201d1She mentioned nothing about how lonely she felt in this unfamiliar city. She could not rely on her daughter, and her dearest granddaughter now had a family of her own. Min Yu was the only other person she knew here, the only person she could call.1\u201cLittle Mr. Min?\u201d Huo Yao asked as she tilted her head with a look of befuddlement. \u201cWhy are you referring to him as a teacher?\u201d\u201cErm\u2026 Isn\u2019t he your tutor?\u201d Yang Qiuhua asked her in surprise.Huo Yao blinked. Although she was unaware of why Yang Qiuhua misunderstood their relationship, it saved her a lot of explaining, so she acknowledged it. \u201cYes, he\u2019s my tutor.\u201d1When Yang Qiuhua heard Huo Yao, she unsuspectingly sighed and said, \u201cHe\u2019s a pretty good tutor. You used to be at the bottom rung in school all the time, but he turned your grades around drastically. Yaoyao, you must invite him over for dinner so that we can thank him properly.\u201dHuo Yao, \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85: Do You Know How Much My Pills Are Worth?Min Yu was far away in the capital when he suddenly sneezed. His handsome features looked particularly pale, and only his eyes remained deep.\u201cMaster, are you feeling\u2026\u201d asked Zhuo Yun worriedly.Min Yu raised his hand and said, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cThe auction starts at 6:00 pm. Do you want to go back to the manor for a rest first?\u201d Zhuo Yun asked, his voice still held concern in it.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Go straight to the event,\u201d said Min Yu with a cool look in his eyes.Then he paused and looked sideways before continuing. \u201cWe must keep a close eye on everyone who turns up at the auction.\u201dZhuo Yun replied with a nod. \u201cI understand. The moment he turns up, we will get him.\u201dMin Yu adjusted his cuffs casually. After a long time, he said calmly, \u201cI sure hope so.\u201d\u201cIf he still needs that medicine, he will definitely turn up tonight,\u201d said Zhuo Yun softly with a dark expression on his face.**Huo Yao watched as her Grandmother finished her medication. After they chatted for a while, the old lady fell asleep. She was getting older and was feeling unwell as well, hence this was to be expected.Huo Yao tucked her in and walked out of the hospital ward before long.Shortly after Huo Yao reached the ground floor, she bumped into He Xiaoman. No, from the looks of it, He Xiaoman had been purposely waiting for Huo Yao.\u201cCome with me. I have something to say to you.\u201dHe Xiaoman did not sound too severe since they were in a crowded place, but her face remained arrogant.Huo Yao raised her brow at her domineering command.He Xiaoman had already walked out towards the flower bed. Huo Yao contemplated for a few seconds as she watched her receding back. Then she followed her with a sigh.\u201cTell me, what medicine have you been giving my mom?\u201d asked He Xiaoman with a frosty look in her eyes as though Huo Yao was a criminal.Huo Yao stood with her hands in her pant pockets and appeared unconcerned. Instead of answering her, she asked in return. \u201cWhy? Is there something wrong with them?\u201dHe Xiaoman laughed angrily at her response and retorted. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t come with any packaging or instructions or manufacturer\u2019s information. How can you give dubious pills like those to an elderly woman? Are you trying to kill her, Huo Yao?\u201d\u201cDubious medication?\u201d Huo Yao suddenly laughed at the words.She looked at He Xiaoman\u2019s quizzical face unhurriedly with her profound eyes and said, \u201cDo-you-know-how-much-my-pills-are-worth?\u201dHuo Yao spoke very slowly with a deliberate pause in between each word and sounded sarcastic.He Xiaoman was taken aback by her attitude. She composed herself after a while and sneered. \u201cNo matter how expensive they are, the effectiveness of those pills is questionable.\u201dHow much could folk cure be worth? Huo Yao must be joking!He Xiaoman paused before she spoke again. \u201cMoreover, I showed it to a doctor, and even he said that Mom couldn\u2019t take such folk remedies randomly. It does nothing but stress her heart and is as good as chronic poison to her. Mom has always had stable physical indicators. If it weren\u2019t because of these pills, why would she have a sudden relapse last night? Huo Yao, if anything happens to her, you are to be blamed!\u201dHuo Yao pursed her lips into a smile. These accusations failed to annoy her. She merely said, \u201cWas the doctor whom you showed the pills to, myopic and unlicensed?\u201dHe Xiaoman, \u201c\u2026\u201dHuo Yao smiled as she shook her head. She could not be bothered wasting her time convincing He Xiaoman, so she turned and left from there without speaking.By the time He Xiaoman composed herself, Huo Yao had already gone away, leaving her livid and fuming.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Since she had Huo Yao\u2019s medication now, there was nothing to worry about.Huo Yao spotted a familiar silhouette on her way out of the hospital and instinctively stopped. With a frown, she tried to recognise the person.Was he not Huo Xiang\u2019s agent, Tong Yu? Since they had just met yesterday, Huo Yao still had some impression of him.She narrowed her eyes and scoured through the crowd, but Huo Xiang was nowhere to be seen.It did not necessarily mean that Huo Xiang was at the hospital just because his agent was. After all, he said he would be flying to a neighboring city to film a MV. At this hour of the day, he was probably in flight.Huo Yao swiftly veered her eyes away and left the hospital without lingering on.Shortly after she left, a man wearing a baseball cap and a black mask walked out of the bathroom located on the side.Tong Yu went up to him with a report in hand and said, \u201cXiang, the hospital president, and the neurologist are waiting for you.\u201dHuo Xiang\u2019s eyes landed on the report in Tong Yu\u2019s hand. His eyes remained dim as he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dTong Yu knew that it was hard for Huo Xiang to muster the courage to visit the hospital, so he patted his shoulder and said, \u201cA miracle can always happen.\u201dHuo Xiang laughed in self-deprecation.They headed to the office quickly, where the president and a neurology expert were waiting for them.Tong Yu bowed to both of them politely before he handed them the report.Few minutes later, the hospital president removed his spectacles and said somewhat regretfully, \u201cSevere spinal cord injury takes three to five years to make a full recovery. What\u2019s more, you have spinal nerve damage\u2026 this will impact your rate of recovery greatly.\u201d1The neurology expert added to the president\u2019s diagnosis. \u201cI am afraid what he said is right. As you know, there are nerves in our entire body. If there is damage to the nerves, you might suffer from sensory problems or could end up getting paralyzed. Judging from your examination report, your spinal cord injury is moderate, so we can only suggest taking a conservative approach for the treatment. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t guarantee that you will make a full recovery. Even if there is a chance that you get cured fully, you will no longer be able to do any major strenuous activity.\u201dHuo Xiang clenched his fists when he heard them. He had thought that he was already numb after hearing such diagnoses countless times, but it always ended up stabbing him fiercely.1\u201cIsn\u2019t there any other treatment?\u201dTong Yu\u2019s eyes turned red as he asked the question. He had pulled major connections to get in touch with the hospital president and the neurology expert because this hospital was considered to be the top most in the country in this field.He had hoped to hear something different from this hospital!\u201cMy apologies, there are no other options.\u201dTong Yu wanted to say something more, but Huo Xiang pulled his arm. Huo Xiang bowed to the president and the neurology expert and said politely, \u201cI get it. Thanks.\u201dInstantly, he turned to leave from there without waiting for them to respond.Huo Xiang looked frail from behind. There seemed to be a depressed and hopeless aura emanating from him. It was really heartbreaking to watch him.Although the doctor had seen plenty of patients with bad spinal nerve damage, the neurology expert sighed helplessly. His eyes suddenly landed on a magazine kept on a side table beside him.He hastily recalled something and shouted, \u201cHang on.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he heard the doctor\u2019s words, he swiftly turned around and asked him. \u201cWho?\u201dThe neurology expert held the magazine in mid-air and pointed at a photo. He said, \u201cThis guy is the Chinese medical genius, Lin.\u201dHuo Xiang\u2019s eyes landed on the photo in the magazine. Instantly, he was stunned.\u201cLin won multiple international medical awards when he was only 19 years old. His medical research has caused major sensation in the medical industry. He specializes in neurology. If he is willing to help, you might have a chance to recover.\u201dThe neurology expert spoke with such admiration that it was clear he held Lin in high esteem.Tong Yu looked delighted the moment he heard the expert\u2019s words. He asked the person eagerly. \u201cCan we take this magazine with us?\u201dThe neurology expert generously handed it over to him and continued speaking. \u201cI have heard that Lin is rather eccentric and doesn\u2019t readily provide consultations, but you can give it a go.\u201dTong Yu thanked him as he took the magazine from his hand. At this stage, he could not be bothered with the doctor\u2019s eccentricity. The important thing was that Huo Xiang had a chance to attain recovery.Even if Lin did not readily see patients, Tong Yu had to find a way to make him agree.*After leaving the hospital, they got into the car. Tong Yu hugged the magazine without the usual anxiety visible on his face.\u201cHuo Xiang, don\u2019t worry about your spinal cord damage. We have a real chance now. If we can find Lin, you will be able to return to the stage soon. I checked online, but there isn\u2019t much information about this guy,\u201d said Tong Yu as he browsed on his phone.Huo Xiang was still overwhelmed with the shock of seeing the photo, so he did not hear a word that Tong Yu uttered.A while later, Tong Yu\u2019s hopeful face became grave once more as he said, \u201cLin does seem to have an odd temperament. Rumor has it that he doesn\u2019t help unless\u2026 it\u2019s a world-class rare disease.\u201dTong Yu turned to look at Huo Xiang and said softly, \u201cHuo Xiang, we\u2026\u201dHuo Xiang finally collected himself. He eventually interrupted Tong Yu softly and consoled him. \u201cHe will help me.\u201dTong Yu narrowed his eyes. He found Huo Xiang\u2019s sudden confidence incomprehensible and asked him suspiciously. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dHuo Xiang took the magazine from Tong Yu and flipped it over to Lin\u2019s photo. He removed his black mask and held the magazine up. After that, he asked his agent in a mild tone. \u201cWhat do you see?1Even though Huo Xiang\u2019s actions confused Tong Yu further, he repeatedly compared the picture to Huo Xiang\u2019s face.After a few moments, he said quizzically, \u201cBoth of you are equally handsome? Eh, Xiang. At a time like this, how can you have the mood to care about who\u2019s more good looking?\u201dHuo Xiang\u2019s face turned dark. He gritted his teeth and rubbed his forehead. Then he said with gritted teeth, \u201cDon\u2019t you think we resemble each other a lot?\u201dTong Yu scrutinized the photo again and replied carefully. \u201cNow that you mention it, you do look like each other\u2026\u201dHe suddenly froze and a look of disbelief emerged on his face. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me he\u2019s\u2026\u201dAfter Tong Yu seemed to understand what Huo Xiang was driving at, he closed the magazine and put his mask back on.

Although he was no longer angry, he felt unhappy inside, so he behaved indifferently when he saw her.\u201cDidn\u2019t Xiang come home yesterday?\u201d asked Huo Yanxi as he looked around the living room and asked Song Ning while she was cooking in the kitchen.Song Ning looked at him quizzically and said, \u201cHe told us that he had to fly to City B to film a MV. Did you come home looking for him? Since you\u2019re here, why don\u2019t you have lunch before you leave?\u201dHuo Yanxi replied with a shake of his head. \u201cMhm. It\u2019s nothing. I just haven\u2019t seen him in a while and thought he would be resting at home for some time.\u201d\u201cI called you yesterday, but you missed it because you were busy I guess.\u201d Song Ning responded angrily.Huo Yanxi coughed in an uneasy manner.\u201cHave you eaten though? Lunch will be ready soon. You can chat with your younger sister in the living room in the meanwhile.\u201dSong Ning paused before she added. \u201cWatch your temper. Yaoyao is your biological sister, so don\u2019t be harsh and judgmental towards her.\u201dHuo Yanxi wanted to refuse staying back, but he swallowed his words after hearing his mother\u2019s last sentence.Huo Yao was sitting cross-legged on the couch and seemed completely engrossed in reading a book. When Huo Yanxi sat down besides her, she did not even seem to notice him.Huo Yanxi\u2019s eyes turned dim. He assumed that she was deliberately ignoring him, so he did not talk to her, either. Instead, he picked up the TV\u2019s remote control.The sound of the television playing broke the silence in the living room quickly.Huo Yao glanced up briefly before going back to her reading. She was clearly unaffected by the outside world.Huo Yanxi did not intend to watch television. Despite Song Ning\u2019s insistence on showing some patience towards his sister, he was incapable of giving in and talking to her, so he kept changing channels aimlessly.Neither of them noticed what was airing on the television.Suddenly, a variety show on the Mango Station caught Huo Yanxi\u2019s attention. It was because Lu Xia was on television.Lu Xia specialized in both singing and dancing. She was very lively when she performed and was the mainstay of the girls\u2019 group. The camera stayed on her almost for the entire time throughout the program. She seemed to glow like a natural celebrity.Even Huo Yanxi, who did not usually watch variety shows, could not help feeling impressed at her talented performance. Lu Xia was bound to become a hit in due time.After the performance ended, the host moved onto other segments of the show. Since Lu Xia was the most popular member of her group, the host naturally interviewed her for longer.\u201cMy lovely Xiaxia, what do you like to do in your free time other than train?\u201d asked the host.Lu Xia smiled sweetly with her exquisitely made-up face on the television and replied politely. \u201cOther than training, I spend most of my time studying. After all, I\u2019m still in my senior year.\u201d\u201cHaha, doesn\u2019t everyone just adore Xiaxia for being so diligent?\u201d said the host as she teased Lu Xia on camera.The host briefly paused before she smiled and asked her further. \u201cI heard you signed up for the National Quiz Contest and ranked 6th in the country in the preliminary test. How do you feel about that, Xiaxia? Would you like to share with us what motivates you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I will continue to do my best and perform well for the final quiz so as not to disappoint any of you.\u201dThe host beamed widely as she changed the subject and started interviewing the other members of the group.Huo Yanxi stopped watching the interview. Instead, he fished out his phone and texted Lu Xia on WeChat.[Congratulations on coming 6th in the country.]Lu Xia happened to have her phone with her at the time.When she saw Huo Yanxi\u2019s text, she thought for a few seconds before she replied: [Thanks, Brother Yanxi. Cute face emoticon. How did you get to know about my result?]Huo Yanxi smiled and replied: [I just saw you on a variety show.]Lu Xia\u2019s fingers paused, then she wrote: [Haha, does Brother Yanxi watch dumb shows like these? I thought you checked it on the official website for the quiz.]Huo Yanxi could not help asking in surprise: [Does your quiz have an official website?]Lu Xia narrowed her eyes and replied: [Of course. If you want to check on a student, you need to enter his or her candidate number, or else it\u2019s simply too much trouble to scroll through the entire ranking list. After all, there are so many middle school students in the country who participated.]Huo Yanxi wrote: [That\u2019s true. When\u2019s the next round? Don\u2019t forget to tell me about your scores.]Lu Xia sent another cute emoticon over and wrote: [Sure thing. The next round happens next week. I\u2019ll text you when my scores are out.]Huo Yanxi replied: [Good luck!]Song Ning yelled that lunch was ready, so Huo Yanxi stopped chatting with Lu Xia and put his phone away. When he stood up, he glanced at Huo Yao shutting her book calmly.The cover page of the book was entirely in English without a single Chinese annotation. It looked like serious reading.Huo Yanxi was startled. Despite his relatively good command of English, he was incapable of figuring out the subject of the book at a glance.His younger sister was able to look so engrossed reading this English book. She had been undistracted even when he turned on the television.She was simply too pretentious.If Huo Yao was reading a normal English textbook, he would have thought nothing of it, but\u2026Fine, she sure was very good at acting studious.1Huo Yanxi shook his head speechlessly and headed to the study to tell his father that dinner was ready.*At the dining table, Song Ning ignored her firstborn son and kept placing food in her daughter\u2019s bowl.\u201cYaoyao, eat more. You\u2019ve been reading so much that you\u2019ve lost weight,\u201d said Song Ning heartbrokenly.The other kids hung out with their friends over the weekends, but their daughter just kept studying. If this went on, Huo Yao would genuinely become a nerd.When Huo Yanxi heard Song Ning saying that Huo Yao had been studying hard, he cast a weird look at her.Everyone read books that were related to their middle school studies. But what was his little sister reading?He could not bring himself to appreciate his mother for this unconditional indulgence of her daughter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How did you fare in the preliminary test?\u201dHuo Yanxi looked at Huo Yao and continued to speak without waiting for her reply. \u201cXiaxia signed up for the quiz too. Her results were pretty good and came in amongst the top 10.\u201dHe did not say Lu Xia came in 6th, so as not to embarrass her.Huo Yao\u2019s eyebrows twitched slightly but she didn\u2019t speak up.Song Ning and Huo Jinyan did not seem surprised at all when they heard this. Instead\u2026\u201cOh, Xiaxia did pretty well,\u201d said Song Ning as she nodded patronizingly.Huo Jinyan also commented rather calmly. \u201cLu Xia always did well in school. It\u2019s no surprise that she made it into the top 10.\u201dBut no matter how well Lu Xia did, she could not surpass their daughter!After all, their girl scored full marks and came in first!When Huo Yanxi saw his parents\u2019 lackluster response towards Lu Xia\u2019s results, he raised his head to look at them. They had reared and doted on Lu Xia for over a decade after all. Even if she was not their daughter by blood, they did not have to be so unenthusiastic about the whole thing.Were they worried about Huo Yao\u2019s feelings because she did not perform as well as her?Huo Yanxi twitched his lips. But the moment the thought crossed his mind, his father\u2019s voice quickly reached his ears.\u201cOur Yaoyao is the best though. She transferred from a small county middle school and scored full marks before she even acclimated to the city\u2019s education system. She has made our family proud!\u201dHuo Jinyan was beaming and looked honored. His face had the expression which seemed to say, \u2018I have the smartest daughter on earth\u2019.\u201cThat\u2019s right. She came first in the country!\u201d said Song Ning excitedly with her chin raised in pride.When Huo Yanxi heard his parents, he raised his head to look at them in shock and asked in a whisper. \u201cFull marks? Top in the country?\u201dSong Ning innocently blinked when she detected Huo Yanxi\u2019s disbelief. She said, \u201cYes, that\u2019s right. Didn\u2019t I tell you about it?\u201dHuo Jinyan solemnly glanced at his wife. \u201cIt might have slipped your mind.\u201d\u201cHow can that be? Doesn\u2019t she have awful grades?\u201d Huo Yanxi blurted out instinctively.Song Ning raised her brow as she glanced at her oldest son and asked him. \u201cWho told you Yaoyao had bad grades?\u201dShe clearly forgot that she used to think Huo Yao had lousy grades too.Huo Yanxi was confused for a moment.\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe us, then go and check online. The ranking list appears the moment you run a search,\u201d sneered Song Ning.She was clearly expressing her disappointment over her son\u2019s distrust towards his younger sister.The moment Huo Yanxi heard his mother, his face went so stiff that he almost could not keep his chopsticks upright. He did not reach for his phone to check the ranking because he knew that his parents would never joke about this.Complicated emotions ran through Huo Yanxi as he glanced at Huo Yao while she quietly ate.He had always thought that his little sister was a bad performer and even believed that she obtained the No.1 Middle School Acceptance Letter through unsavory means.When Huo Yanxi first heard that Huo Yao signed up for the National Quiz Contest, he had thought she was messing around because of his preconceptions about her. He had believed that he was doing her a favor by offering to hire a tuition teacher for her. When she turned him down, he had judged her for being arrogant and for aiming too high.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He found his misconception of his little sister hilarious now. He was also taken aback about the way she had said nothing all this while, even though she was a straight A-student.If Huo Yao had told him even a little about herself, he would never have misunderstood, and the two of them would not have fallen out like this.3Perhaps due to the embarrassment that Huo Yanxi brought upon himself, he found the food unpalatable. Maybe he did not know how to face Huo Yao, so the moment his phone rang in his pocket, he made some excuse and left for the office in a hurry without finishing his food.Song Ning glanced at the main entrance and muttered softly. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the weekend?\u201dHuo Jinyan raised his brow and said in a vague manner, \u201cHe\u2019s just embarrassed.\u201dSong Ning looked quizzically at her husband.Huo Jinyan only smiled without speaking any further.1*After Huo Yanxi went downstairs, he did not start the car right away. Instead, he pulled out his phone and ran a search for the National Quiz Contest on the web browser.He entered the official web page very quickly and found the rank listing before long. After entering the page, he effortlessly found that Huo Yao had come in first with a score of 150.Huo Yanxi\u2019s eyes hovered on the screen for a long time before he started to move his fingers. He caught sight of Lu Xia\u2019s name after he scrolled further down.If Huo Yanxi had not brought up the topic of the quiz and his parents did not tell him about his little sister\u2019s score, he might have gone on presuming that she had lousy grades. He might even have kept feeling proud of his foster sister instead\u2026When Huo Yanxi recalled his recent attitude, he pulled his hair in frustration before throwing his phone aside and driving off.It was just a preliminary test, so it was no big deal.**On MondayHuo Yao was called to the Principal\u2019s office as soon as she got to the school.\u201cHuo Yao, long time no see,\u201d said the Principal as he beamed at Huo Yao the moment he saw her. He seemed particularly warm and courteous.Huo Yao bowed and politely greeted him. \u201cHello, what did you need me for?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been caught up with work since the school term started and then went on a business trip. I didn\u2019t expect that rumors of you using connections to enter the school would spread like this.\u201dThe Principal\u2019s face sank and he continued apologetically. \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault that this misunderstanding arose. I didn\u2019t put my point across to the teachers clearly enough. Don\u2019t worry, Huo Yao. I\u2019ll clear your name.\u201dHuo Yao looked at the Principal in surprise.She composed herself and shook her head as she replied in a calm manner. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Since the rumors are unfounded, they will stop in time. The more I defend myself, the more suspicion I arouse.\u201dThe Principal was stunned. He did not expect such nonchalance from her. Then again, geniuses like Huo Yao usually did not really care what others thought about them. He was the one\u2026 who seemed narrow-minded now.Huo Yao continued speaking with an ambiguous smile. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be a bigger slap on their faces if I used my ability to prove myself?\u201d1The Principal smiled as he shook his head. He walked over to the water dispenser and got her some water. He said, \u201cI feel optimistic about your results for the National Quiz Contest.\u201dHuo Yao took the glass of water and mulled over something before she spoke next. \u201cI hadn\u2019t signed up for the quiz.\u201dThe Principal coughed uneasily and gestured to her to take a seat. He said sheepishly, \u201cI was the one who signed up on your behalf.\u201d3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yet the moment she laid her hands on them, she answered them effortlessly as though they were elementary school questions. She was capable of applying what she learned, exceptionally well.She had almost caused the collapse of many college education systems, but no one knew her real identity.If not for the No.1 Middle School\u2019s online admission test, she would have probably never gotten exposed as the 17 year old girl who gave those colleges such a headache.It was also a stroke of luck that he managed to invite her to join the No.1 Middle School. Since she was planning to study in City S, and it was the best middle school in town, she had taken an interest in this school.Of course, the Principal had no idea that she would actually pick the No.1 Middle School in the end.The Principal\u2019s inexplicable trust in her made Huo Yao helplessly say, \u201cI only want to study hard.\u201dThe Principal twitched his lips and replied. \u201cThere\u2019s no conflict between the schoolwork and the quiz.\u201d\u201cBut why did you want me to take part in the quiz?\u201d asked Huo Yao bluntly.The Principal adjusted his spectacles and told her. \u201cAlthough we have managed to maintain the school\u2019s enrolment rate in recent years, it\u2019s clearly declining\u2026\u201dHe paused for a moment before he said somewhat bitterly, \u201cI want to improve the No.1 Middle School\u2019s reputation.\u201dHuo Yao flashed an okay sign and said, \u201cI get it.\u201dThe Principal did not have to beat around the bush since he was talking to an intelligent person. He looked at Huo Yao and pondered for a few seconds before speaking further. \u201cThe significance of this quiz isn\u2019t as simple as it seems. If you do well, the capital\u2019s major associations might try to headhunt you. It will do wonders for your career in the future.\u201dHuo Yao raised her brow and was somewhat surprised.The Principal smiled and said, \u201cStaying at the No.1 Middle School is beneath you, given your talent. There isn\u2019t much I can help you with either.\u201dHuo Yao waved and said lazily, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do more. You\u2019re doing enough.\u201dThen she stood up. \u201cIt\u2019s almost time for class. I\u2019m going back.\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d replied the Principal without speaking further.But when Huo Yao stepped out through the door, he suddenly said, \u201cI didn\u2019t tell anyone about what happened online.\u201dHuo Yao halted. She gave him a sideways smile and left.There was a profound look in the Principal\u2019s eyes. The warm expression on his face suddenly turned downcast after Huo Yao was completely out of sight. He walked over to his office desk and picked up the landline to make a call.Although the young lady did not care about clearing her name, it did not mean he would condone it when people stirred trouble in his absence.***In the blink of an eye, it was time for the National Quiz Contest\u2019s official heats.The city level heats were all conducted at the city\u2019s Education Center instead of the participating middle schools.Huo Yao did not need to attend school this morning and headed straight to the exam hall.Song Ning and Huo Jinyan had woken up early in the morning when they learned that their daughter was to appear for the quiz today. They even prepared a more sumptuous breakfast than usual.All of them headed downstairs after breakfast and they kept asking Huo Yao endlessly about whether she had everything she needed while they were in the lift.Her parents looked so nervous that it seemed as though they were preparing for war. Huo Yao did not know whether she should cry or laugh.She consoled them and said, \u201cMom and Dad. It\u2019s just a little quiz. No need to get dramatic.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She could not help recalling the same nonchalant attitude Huo Yao had given her when she asked about the quiz a few days ago. Huo Yao had called it a dumb quiz, that did not even offer a cash prize.How could this be trivial if Huo Yao stood to win a commendation to the country\u2019s best college?There was a complicated expression on Song Ning\u2019s face. What should she do about her daughter? Huo Yao really deserved a spanking.Huo Jinyan, alongwith his wife and daughter, drove their old Volkswagen Santana to the Education Center.The people standing at the building entrance were mostly students\u2019 parents. Apart from them, a television station was also present there to film the event.\u201cHmmm? Will the quiz be aired on TV?\u201d asked Huo Jinyan in surprise.Huo Yao frowned when she caught sight of the camera at the entrance. Then she shook her head and replied to him. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Just perform like you usually do,\u201d said Song Ning.Huo Yao said indifferently, \u201cMhm.\u201d She seemed very calm and not the slightest bit anxious.At the same time, the Lu family chauffeur brought Lu Xia and He Xiaoman to the venue.When Lu Xia and He Xiaoman got out of the car, the cameraman at the entrance swiftly turned to film her, and the host went over to interview her.Huo Jinyan and Song Ning were unsurprised to see Lu Xia. They were well aware that she had signed up for the quiz.Since the camera crew surrounded Lu Xia, they did not go up to say hi. Moreover, He Xiaoman was standing right next to her, and they did not like her at all.Song Ning especially detested He Xiaoman for her attitude in the past. Just the thought of it made her seethe. Moreover, He Xiaoman had dumped Huo Yao in a small county all her life because she held a contemptible patriarchal view.Song Ning averted her eyes and turned sideways to block Huo Yao from He Xiaoman\u2019s view. She hurriedly said to Huo Yao, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you move to the exam hall? You can go in and locate your seat first.\u201dHuo Yao detected that something was amiss with Song Ning but did not probe her and replied with a nod. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going in.\u201dSong Ning patted Huo Yao\u2019s shoulder and encouraged her. \u201cGood luck! Mom and Dad will be waiting for you at the entrance.\u201dHuo Yao hung her student pass around her neck and headed towards the entrance, where the staff scanned her pass before letting her in.After the television station was done interviewing Lu Xia, they moved towards other students\u2019 parents.Even without the camera on her, He Xiaoman kept up a gracious smile. But she frowned when her eyes landed on Song Ning and Huo Jinyan, who were standing nearby.She asked her daughter softly. \u201cWhy are your foster parents here?\u201dLu Xia was well aware of He Xiaoman\u2019s despise for the Huo family, so she could not greet them in her mother\u2019s presence. She merely lowered her eyes and replied gently. \u201cHuo Yao signed up for the quiz too.\u201dHe Xiaoman scoffed when she heard that. \u201cHow dare she take part in this quiz with those atrocious grades of hers? Does she think that this is a joke?\u201dLu Xia\u2019s expression turned dark when she thought about the score that Huo Yao had achieved in the preliminary test.She said, \u201cMom, she is not the same Huo Yao as earlier. She\u2019s gotten quite\u2026 good these days.\u201d\u201cGood? Ok, but can she beat my daughter?\u201d replied He Xiaoman without taking Lu Xia\u2019s words seriously.1She did not even want to find out more about Huo Yao\u2019s situation. Instead, she checked the time on her watch and became impatient.She said, \u201cEnough. Hurry up and go in. Do well, and don\u2019t disgrace the Lu family.\u201dLu Xia\u2019s lips twitched as she replied in a confident manner. \u201cOkay.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In this one, other than a written paper, they would also get tested on theory and logic, so it was far more challenging.The time limit for the written test was an hour. The students were supposed to head to the examination hall next door after finishing the written test to take the next test, which was also time bound.Huo Yao read through the entire paper after she received it and shook her head in disinterest. Although it was more challenging than the preliminary test\u2026 it was still as easy as pie for her.She picked up her pen disappointingly and answered each question slowly.Sigh! She finished the preliminary test too quickly, so her teacher had assumed that she did not treat it seriously enough. This time, she had to look the part.Although Huo Yao was confident that she had taken enough time, she still gloriously finished first. Even the invigilator was surprised by her speed.After accepting the answer script, the invigilator especially took note of her name.Huo Yao? Was she not the kid who scored full marks in the preliminary test?The invigilator was in a daze as he held her answer script.Huo Yao went straight to the examination hall next door. In there, three invigilators would draw questions for the participant to answer within a ten minute time frame.Was this not like an interview?Huo Yao tutted and griped. The exam was prepared by the Education Association and certainly lived up to her expectation of being absolutely boring.Very quickly, three questions were drawn. One was related to history, while the other two were science questions. This mainly served to determine the candidates\u2019 level of logical competence in varied fields.Huo Yao was not the least bit anxious after she read the questions. After all, her copious amount of reading was bound to come in handy, someday.Huo Yao finished answering all her questions within two minutes. It was literally a child\u2019s play for her.Instead, the invigilators were the ones who were shocked. After Huo Yao left the exam hall, they could not help lamenting amongst themselves. \u201cThis participant is probably the best student I have met in my life.\u201d\u201cAll she took was two minutes. She had ended up receiving three of the hardest questions from the entire lot. When I watched her harness that insane logic of hers, it was as though I was watching the birth of a genius.\u201d\u201cI have suddenly realised that our country might be about to make its mark in the International Quiz Contest this year.\u201d\u2026The camera crew from the television station was there to shoot the entire event. The host thought that the first person to finish would be the campus celebrity, Lu Xia. Hence, everyone was ready and poised to interview her.After all, given her status as a popular celebrity, it would help sell the show more.But it was Huo Yao who unexpectedly came out first. The host was caught by surprise, but she quickly composed herself and went over with the microphone to ask Huo Yao about the quiz.Although it was not Lu Xia, the girl who came out first was an extraordinary beauty who gave off a cool aura and possessed photogenic features.Huo Yao slapped her forehead helplessly as she glanced at the camera. If she knew that the camera crew would hound her, she would not have come out early.\u201cHi, how do you feel about the quiz? Are you confident about making it into the provincial level competition?\u201d asked the host as she smiled.Huo Yao looked at her expressionlessly and replied in a calm manner. \u201cIt was quite easy.\u201dWhen the host heard this patronizing and arrogant response, she almost choked. This was the first time that she had gone speechless with her microphone in hand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I wish you all the best.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201dThe host watched as Huo Yao left. She clicked her tongue and said, \u201cI wonder which school this girl goes to? She\u2019s gorgeous. If she entered the entertainment industry, countless fans would go crazy for her.\u201d*The moment Huo Yao came out, Song Ning and Huo Jinyan quickly spotted her.\u201cAre you done already? So soon?\u201d asked Song Ning. She purposely glanced at the entrance and saw no other students there.\u201cMhm,\u201d replied Huo Yao softly. If she did not deliberately prolong the process to look serious and sincere, she could have come out even sooner.\u201cHow did you fare?\u201d asked Song Ning. Despite her confidence in her daughter, she could not help feeling curious about her performance.Huo Yao raised her brow and said, \u201cIt was easy.\u201dHuo Jinyan asked her. \u201cWhen will the results be released?\u201d\u201cTomorrow morning at 10:00 am.\u201dHuo Jinyan nodded and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Mom and Dad are taking out to eat and celebrate.\u201dHuo Yao\u2019s parents had discussed this while they were waiting for her at the entrance.Huo Yao looked at them and asked. \u201cWon\u2019t the results only be out tomorrow?\u201d\u201cHeehee. My girl is a straight-A student. I don\u2019t have to see it to know that you would have done well,\u201d said Song Ning proudly.Huo Jinyan shook his head in laughter and said, \u201cCome on. You can talk in the car.\u201dVery quickly, the three of them drove off.He Xiaoman was sitting in her car nearby as she waited for Lu Xia. She had been watching the Huos since the moment Huo Yao came out until they left.When she caught sight of the battered Volkswagen Santana which Huo Jinyan was driving, her look of disdain became even more intense.Sure enough, penniless families bred beggarly daughters.He Xiaoman raised her hand to check her watch. Despite her exquisite makeup, her face looked twisted and filled with impatience.She said to the chauffeur, \u201cGo and find out what\u2019s keeping Lu Xia.\u201d\u201cYes, Madam.\u201dLu Xia finally came out ten minutes later. Shortly after she got into the car, He Xiaoman angrily asked her. \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201dLu Xia was startled. Since she detected He Xiaoman\u2019s impatience, she said gently, \u201cThe quiz was tough, so I had to spend more time on it. Also, the television station wanted to interview me, so I was held up.\u201dThe fury on He Xiaoman\u2019s face swiftly dissipated when she heard Lu Xia. Then she smiled maliciously.That\u2019s true. He Xiaoman\u2019s foster daughter must have turned in her answer script early because it was too hard for her.\u201cHow do you think you fared?\u201d asked He Xiaoman.\u201cIt was okay. I should be able to make it into the next round,\u201d said Lu Xia. Although she sounded nonchalant, it was clear that she was confident.\u201cMhm. Good. The Lu family\u2019s daughter has to be a cut above the rest, especially Huo Yao!\u201d sneered He Xiaoman softly.Lu Xia stared out of the car\u2019s window with a cold look in her eyes, but He Xiaoman did not catch it.Lu Xia hated it when her mother compared her to Huo Yao. It made her feel like she was always being pitted against Huo Yao\u2019s level.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96: No Intention Of Telling Their Daughter The Truth About Their FamilyHuo Jinyan brought his wife and daughter to a famous seafood restaurant in the city.After getting off the car, Huo Yao stared at the restaurant\u2019s magnificent d\u00e9cor. Every inch of the restaurant looked so posh that she went into a daze.Huo Jinyan dropped the ladies off before going to park the car. Song Ning turned to look at her daughter in confusion when she noticed that her daughter had not followed her. She turned around and asked her. \u201cYaoyao, why have you stopped?\u201dHuo Yao blinked and said solemnly, \u201cI\u2019m wondering how much it would cost to dine here. After all, we aren\u2019t rich.\u201dHer daughter\u2019s words tickled Song Ning. With a composed face, she said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We can dine here every day if you like. We can afford it.\u201dAfter all, this restaurant was their family\u2019s business.Their daughter had mistakenly thought that they were poor. Since both Song Ning and Huo Jinyan found it entertaining, they had decided not to tell their daughter about their family\u2019s true financial situation.Huo Yao teasingly replied when she heard Song Ning. \u201cI have a feeling that you are hiding a lot of things from me.\u201dTheir family, which was known to be poor, had started to appear less and less impoverished to Huo Yao.Song Ning coughed and said, \u201cNo, we aren\u2019t hiding anything.\u201dHuo Yao simply said, \u201cOhhhhh.\u201d She dragged her last note for long and clearly did not believe Song Ning.The restaurant manager had already gotten a call from their boss, so he stood at the door waiting for them. When he caught sight of Song Ning, he quickly walked out to welcome them and said respectfully, \u201cMadam, you\u2019re here.\u201dHuo Yao raised her brow when she heard the greeting. Her eyes landed ambiguously on her mother as if saying, \u201cIs this your so-called \u2018no, we aren\u2019t hiding anything\u2019?\u201dSong Ning rubbed the space between her brows.Oops! Busted!Song Ning cleared her throat and told herself not to panic. Then she nodded to the restaurant manager indifferently before telling Huo Yao with a straight face. \u201cWhat do you think? Doesn\u2019t this restaurant have great service?\u201dThe restaurant manager went, \u201c\u2026\u201dDid the lady boss just praise him?Huo Yao\u2019s lips twitched. She glanced at the man, who was still bowing at them. It definitely seemed as though she was going further and further away from poverty.After some time, Huo Yao nodded and said, \u201cYes, it\u2019s pretty good.\u201d\u201cCarry on. We will go to the private room on our own,\u201d said Song Ning as she eyed the restaurant manager and signaled for him to leave.Although the restaurant manager had no idea what the lady boss was up to, he naturally understood what she wanted. He was an employee who was sharp and observant.Very quickly, the restaurant manager left and told the staff not to disturb the Huo family while they were enjoying their meal.Song Ning was happy with the restaurant manager\u2019s reaction. She pulled her daughter along and went upstairs to the Huos private room on the second floor.The private room was huge, and its d\u00e9cor was extravagant and opulent.\u201cYao, what would you like to have?\u201d asked Song Ning as she placed the menu in front of Huo Yao and told her to order whatever she liked.Huo Yao picked up the menu and flipped to the first page. When she caught sight of the price, she went quiet again.Huo Yao felt as though she was following the wrong plot.After parking the car, Huo Jinyan reached the restaurant. He rolled up his sleeves and said, \u201cTingrui called to say he\u2019s coming over to eat with us.\u201dSong Ning was caught by surprise. \u201cIs he back?\u201d\u201cMhm. He came back yesterday,\u201d said Huo Jinyan as he nodded and looked sideways at his daughter.\u201cYaoyao, you\u2019ll get to see your second older brother in a few moments.\u201dHuo Yao asked as she handed the menu back to him. \u201cWhat does my second older brother do for a living?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had deep eyes and wore a pair of rimless glasses on his high nose bridge. He seemed refined and sharp and had the aura of an elite lawyer.1The moment he entered the private room, he greeted Song Ning and Huo Jinyan before turning his eyes to look at Huo Yao. He was clearly shocked when he caught sight of her.The girl had inherited their parents\u2019 best DNA. Huo Yao was sitting there quietly and was really pretty. She did not appear to have been raised in the countryside and was completely different from the photo she had sent via WeChat.1This was unexpected.Huo Tingrui pondered for a few seconds before he turned to walk over to Huo Yao. He pulled out the chair and sat next to her. He introduced himself rather officially to her. \u201cYaoyao, I\u2019m Huo Tingrui, your second older brother.\u201dHuo Yao looked at Huo Tingrui with her bright, unsullied eyes. She said unhurriedly, \u201cHi, Brother Tingrui.\u201dWhen Huo Tingrui heard her greeting, an inexplicable emotion flooded his heart. Perhaps due to their blood bond, he felt closer to her than Lu Xia when he heard Huo Yao call him \u2018Brother Tingrui\u2019.With that thought in his mind, Huo Tingrui said, \u201cSay that again.\u201dHuo Yao, \u201c???\u201d3Huo Tingrui coughed. He awkwardly adjusted his glasses and changed the subject. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring you any presents today. Shall we go present hunting after we eat?\u201dHuo Yao hurriedly shook her head and said, \u201cI\u2019ll pass. I have classes at school in the afternoon.\u201dDid this entire family have some quirk about giving gifts?It belatedly dawned on Huo Tingrui that his baby sister was still a student, so he did not force her.After contemplating for a moment, he pulled out his phone from his pocket and turned it on as he said, \u201cI will send you a little red packet. You can pick out a present when you\u2019re free.\u201d2When Huo Yao saw Huo Tingrui take out his phone, her temples suddenly started to throb. Before she could refuse him, her phone lit up with a notification.Huo Yao glanced at the amount of money he had just transferred and her lips twitched. Did her second older brother have some misconceptions about the definition of the word \u2018small\u2019?Two hundred thousand! Was that a small red packet? Was it small? Was it small at all?Huo Yao pressed her eyebrows. Sure enough, this awful habit of giving her money ran through the family.Huo Tingrui detected Huo Yao\u2019s complicated expression. He touched his chin. Two hundred thousand was definitely too little, so he pulled out his wallet from his pocket and handed her a card.\u201cTake this card as well. Buy anything you like with it. The password is\u2026\u201d said Huo Tingrui.Then he placed the bank card on the table.Huo Yao, \u201c\u2026\u201dThe feeling that she had unexpectedly turned into a girl from a rich family, was becoming more intense!\u201cYou must remember to use my card also!\u201d Huo Jinyan chimed in immediately.2After seeing his son hand Huo Yao a bank card, he reminded Huo Yao to use his as well.

He said, \u201cThat\u2019s great! I couldn\u2019t get in as I was two marks short.

You couldn\u2019t get in because you asked for it. You don\u2019t deserve any pity,\u201d said Song Ning as she disclosed his shortcomings ruthlessly.Huo Tingrui coughed to disguise his embarrassment and muttered. \u201cPeople make mistakes when they are young.\u201d2\u201cHeh, you have so many excuses. Look at how diligent your baby sister is. She just took part in the National Quiz Contest and scored full marks. She\u2019s way better than any of you boys.\u201dThe moment she mentioned their daughter\u2019s scores, Song Ning could not help beaming brightly.\u201cAre you for real?\u201d said Huo Tingrui. He could not suppress his shock.\u201cOf course. I won\u2019t lie about it. Yaoyao just went for the city level test today. Her scores will be out tomorrow. Remember to go online and check it out,\u201d sneered Song Ning.Huo Tingrui turned to look at Huo Yao and looked wounded. He said, \u201cI heard about the contest when I was in school. It\u2019s held once every two years, and all the straight-A students in the country take part in it. Did Yao score full marks for the prelim\u2026\u201dThat was incredible!!!Huo Yao made eye contact with Huo Tingrui, who had a complicated look in his eyes. She pursed her lips into an adorable smile and said casually, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dHuo Tingrui, \u201c!!!\u201dAHHHH. It felt as though Huo Yao had ousted him as the brightest kid in the family.1*Huo Yao got ready to return to school after lunch. Huo Jinyan was supposed to send her but Huo Tingrui took over instead.Huo Tingrui kept looking at his little sister from time to time as she sat in the front passenger seat. He could not help lamenting in his heart. Why were they so different even though they were born to the same set of parents?Huo Yao sensed his stare. Her head was slanted, making her hair fall on her shoulder. She had a playful look about her. She looked at him somewhat quizzically and said, \u201cBrother Tingrui?\u201dHuo Tingrui cleared his throat and said, \u201cI was just wondering who groomed my little sister into such a fine young woman. I should find the time to visit her soon.\u201dSince he was roughly aware of her biological sister\u2019s situation, he knew that Huo Yao did not grow up in the Lu residence but was raised by her grandmother in the countryside. He was suddenly a little curious about the old lady.Huo Yao had not seen this coming. She pondered briefly and replied with a nod. \u201cI\u2019ll ask Grandma about it.\u201d\u201cMhm,\u201d said Huo Tingrui softly without saying anything further.Before long, the car reached the school.\u201cBrother Tingrui, I\u2019m off,\u201d said Huo Yao to Huo Tingrui as she undid her seatbelt.Huo Tingrui rubbed his forehead as he replied, \u201cSure.\u201dHuo Yao had noticed that he kept subconsciously rubbing his head during the entire journey, so she could not help but ask. \u201cAre you unwell?\u201dHuo Tingrui raised his eyes in surprise. But then he shook his head and replied with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s an occupational hazard. Happens when I use my brain too much.\u201dHuo Yao acknowledged him thoughtfully before she opened the car door. After she got out of the car, she turned to ask him. \u201cWhen are you coming home?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s pretty effective. Tell me when you\u2019re coming home, so I can prepare it for you,\u201d said Huo Yao as she briefly explained.After all, Huo Yao just received a \u2018small\u2019 red packet from Huo Tingrui, so she ought to give him something in return. To be fair though, her medication was worth far more than those red packets.Huo Tingrui composed his thoughts and smiled when he realized that Huo Yao was trying to do a kind gesture. Just as he was about to speak up, her voice spoke again, \u201cOr you can send me your address, and I\u2019ll get it couriered to you.\u201dWhen Huo Tingrui saw how serious his little sister was about the matter, he swallowed his words of rejection. He replied with a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll be coming to stay at home for a period of time.\u201dHuo Yao snapped her fingers at him and said, \u201cOkay then. I\u2019ll give it to you tonight.\u201dThen she jumped off the car coolly.Huo Tingrui placed his hands on the steering wheel as he watched his little sister disappear into the distance. He smiled as he shook his head.This little sister of his was cute. No, correction, she was rather cool.As Huo Tingrui started the engine, his car passed by the Lu family\u2019s car which was just entering into the school compound.Lu Xia inadvertently looked up and happened to see Huo Tingrui\u2019s face.\u201cStop the car,\u201d said Lu Xia to the chauffeur hurriedly.The chauffeur stepped on the brake quickly and pulled up on the side.Lu Xia opened the car door, but Huo Tingrui\u2019s car was long gone and had almost completely disappeared by the time she looked behind.Lu Xia bit her lip angrily. Then she took out her phone from her bag and called Huo Tingrui.After a few rings, Huo Tingrui picked up the phone and asked. \u201cXiaxia? Do you need anything?\u201dLu Xia continued gazing in the direction that Huo Tingrui\u2019s car had gone as she said warmly, \u201cNothing. Just wondering whether you are back from your business trip.\u201dHuo Tingrui paused while he was driving the car. Then he said composedly, \u201cNot yet. The case is a little complicated, and I won\u2019t be able to come back so soon.\u201dLu Xia subconsciously tightened her grip on the phone when she heard this and looked upset. After a few seconds, she finally found her voice and said, \u201cAh, I see. Then tell me when you\u2019re coming back. I can come pick you up at the airport.\u201dHuo Tingrui acknowledged her in a perfunctory tone. \u201cMhm. I have a client with me. Talk again when I\u2019m free.\u201d\u201cOkay. Carry on then, Brother Tingrui.\u201dLu Xia stood motionlessly after hanging up the phone for some time, and her eyes suddenly misted.Although both cars brushed past each other quickly, Lu Xia was certain that it was Huo Tingrui\u2019s face and his license plate number.Why did Huo Tingrui lie to Lu Xia about being on a business trip?Was he so cold to Lu Xia because Huo Yao had returned?Oh yes. He was driving from the school earlier on. Without a doubt, Huo Yao must have said something to him!Lu Xia clenched her fists. Her sharp nails seemed to cut through her skin.**After Huo Yao reached the class, Meng Ying, who had been lying listlessly on the table, instantly regained her spirits and said, \u201cSister Big Shot, you\u2019re back. How did your test go?\u201dHuo Yao swept the hair on her cheeks and tucked them behind her ears. She replied in her usual nonchalant manner. \u201cIt was okay.\u201dMeng Ying clicked her tongue. Tsk tsk, Huo Yao sounded indifferent.\u201cYou don\u2019t look very energetic. Did you have a hard time sleeping last night?\u201d asked Huo Yao as she glanced at her.Meng Ying shook her head. Then she placed her chin on the table and acted pitiful. She said, \u201cThe class advisor announced something hateful this morning.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After each test, those with lower average marks than before will suffer an insane corporal punishment!\u201dHuo Yao looked at her lazily and asked. \u201cCorporal punishment?\u201d\u201cYes! We have to run ten rounds every day after school for ten days in a row. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s crazy?\u201d asked Meng Ying as she shivered.Huo Yao\u2019s lips twitched and she asked. \u201cIs it that bad?\u201dWhen Meng Ying heard Huo Yao, she immediately exploded. \u201cIsn\u2019t it? It\u2019s ten whole rounds! Sister Big Shot, do you not know how big our track is? I get so exhausted after running just one round during physical education!\u201dRunning ten rounds around the track was as good as killing Meng Ying!Oh yes, she had forgotten that Sister Big Shot was like a professional athlete during physical education classes. It was as though Huo Yao was in a completely different physical education class or a rather different level.Huo Yao touched her chin and studied Meng Ying. She clicked her tongue as she shook her head and said, \u201cYou have dark eye rings and edema from staying up late. Also, you don\u2019t exercise enough. My dear, you shouldn\u2019t kill yourself at such a young age.\u201d\u201cPFFFT PFFFT\u2026 You make me feel as though you are a professional Chinese physician, who goes around deceiving others,\u201d said Meng Ying as she dug in her desk for her makeup mirror.\u201cAre my eye bags that bad?\u201dHuo Yao, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThey do look kind of serious,\u201d said Meng Ying woefully before putting down the mirror. Then she turned to look at Huo Yao\u2019s face.Huo Yao\u2019s complexion was bright and translucent without any impurities. Sigh\u2026 her complexion emphasized Meng Ying\u2019s flaws.Meng Ying covered her face and said, \u201cI\u2019m so hurt. Don\u2019t bother trying to console me.\u201dHuo Yao\u2019s lips twitched. She only said airily, \u201cRemember to study hard for the monthly death test.Meng Ying let Huo Yao go and said huffily, \u201cSister Big Shot, how can you give me double whammies like that!\u201dHuo Yao smiled at her gently.Meng Ying, \u201c!!!\u201dHuo Yao was no longer the same Sister Big Shot whom she once knew!**Huo Yao went upstairs after dinner and took out her box of jars and bottles. She removed a light grey bottle and went back downstairs.\u201cBrother Tingrui, this is for you. One pill a day. I can give you more once you\u2019re done,\u201d said Huo Yao as she handed over a bottle to Huo Tingrui.Huo Tingrui raised his brow and accepted the bottle before saying, \u201cAre these the meds for nourishing Qi and blood that you were mentioning in the afternoon?\u201dThen he opened the bottle.\u201cMhm,\u201d replied Huo Yao. \u201cTrust me, they are super effective.\u201dHuo Tingrui smiled. A light Chinese herbal scent wafted in his nostrils when he placed it next to his nose and took a whiff. It smelled good and helped ease his mind. Even his brain felt clearer in a second!\u201cThese meds\u2026.\u201d said Huo Tingrui in shock as he raised his head and looked at Huo Yao.He continued after a pause. \u201cI feel better just by smelling it!\u201dHuo Yao\u2019s lips curved into a smile. Of course, this medication was priceless.\u201cLet me try one now,\u201d said Huo Tingrui as he eagerly took a green bean sized pill out.He took some water from beside him and swallowed the pill.Although it was a Chinese medical pill, it did not choke him like the other medicines.Huo Tingrui was already biased towards the medicine after feeling great from merely smelling it. The moment he took it, it relieved even the weightiness he had felt all these years.This medication was amazing!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
