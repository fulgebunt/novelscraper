The man took deep breaths as he spread his arms toward the sky, and the lights gathered in his palms. And the world dimmed.A foul wind stirred, wreathing with endless howls of agony from untold ghosts.The wind picked up the man\u2019s elegant hair, revealing a demonic face behind.The sun and the moon dimmed while the man grew in power from the rays. Soon, even dark energy began to rise from him.With his face battered by the freezing winds, the dark energy grew thicker until it covered him whole. He released a breath and an evil smile adorned his face.Rumble!With a loud sound as the trigger, the four mountains in vicinity erupted while Devil Peak itself was wracked by terrible tremors. The man absorbing the essences of the sun and moon opened his eyes.With a space rending sound, seven flashes of light appeared. As the light scattered, there stood seven figures radiating ruthless power.His eyebrows shook but a fraction as the man spoke in an eerie voice, \u201cHow are the seven of you here? Didn\u2019t you all despise us demonic cultivators to no end?\u201d\u201cHumph, Demonic Emperor, Zhuo Yifan, isn\u2019t it obvious why we\u2019re here?\u201d An old man stroked his white beard as he gave a look of disdain.His heart skipped a beat and Zhuo Yifan sounded out, \u201cGeezer Sword Emperor, I do not know what you mean.\u201d\u201cHumph, stop faking it and take out the Nine Serenities Secret Records.\u201d A female Daoist stepped arrogantly as she threw her chin forward.Zhuo Yifan paled.It had been only a month since he found the legendary Nine Serenities Emperor\u2019s dwelling. After brushing death countless times in the process, he finally obtained the written accounts he wished to study for all his life. How was it that they caught wind of this?He suddenly recalled something and his face grew darker by the second.\u201cZhao Chen, come out.\u201d shouted Zhuo Yifan.A cheery voice rang through the empty forest on the mountain. Immediately, a handsome youngster in white robes walked from behind the seven, smiling; all the while as he made a curt bow to Zhuo Yifan, \u201cHa-ha-ha, Master, did you ask for me?\u201dZhuo Yifan glared with hatred at the hypocrite and said, \u201cIs this your doing?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d nodded Zhao Chen with a smile.\u201cDid you also cancel the guarding array?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cWhy? I never slight you in the least.\u201d Zhuo Yifan clenched his fist as murderous intent flared out from his eyes.Despite being a demonic cultivator, he normally did not kill without reason. If he did, he was just acting out on his nature. Else, those righteous cultivators would\u2019ve come to end him much sooner. Zhao Chen, for that matter, was an orphan that Zhuo Yifan took in when he saw his talent. Yet, who\u2019d have thought the day would come when Zhao Chen would betray him.Despite putting a front with his calm demour, before Zhuo Yifan\u2019s increasing killing intent, Zhao Chen\u2019s feet betrayed him as he took two steps back, moving closer to the seven beings behind him.\u201cMaster, I understand your kindness is as heavy as a mountain. But that doesn\u2019t give you the right to steal the Eight Emperor seat and cast me in your shadow for all eternity. Even more so, regarding the Nine Serenities Secret Records. Ever since you\u2019ve obtained it, you\u2019ve trained alone, even afraid of me catching a glimpse of it.\u201dZhuo Yifan\u2019s heart clenched when he heard this.Zhao Chen would never know he did it for his sake. Having low cultivation and going head first into studying the Nine Serenities Secret Records would deviate one\u2019s cultivation. He had opted to understand it in its entirety and only then impart it to him.Yet all his plans were ruined in just a short month.\u201cHa-ha-ha, well said. Zhao Chen, you\u2019re a true disciple!\u201dZhuo Yifan\u2019s roaring laughter reached the heavens and so did his rage, \u201cSince it is so, Master will give you a taste of the Nine Serenities Secret Records.\u201d\u201cZhuo Yifan, it is not your place for such unbridled words in the presence of us seven.\u201d The white-bearded old man stepped before Zhao Chen.\u201cHumph, everyone in the Sacred Domain knows me as the Eight Emperor. I could care less if all seven of you Emperors come at me together!\u201dNo sooner said than done, Zhuo Yifan launched a palm at Zhao Chen.A black claw flashed in the sky reaching out for him.His eyes shrunk, face paled, and retreated with haste, fear having taken its grip on the youth.In the face of that powerful claw, the old man drew a sword. A sword wave flashed and the black claw was turned to nothing.\u201cHumph, Nine Serenities Secret Records is nothing great.\u201d The old man stood in the wind with his sword ready, disdain all over his face.Zhuo Yifan smiled and waved his palms, \u201cGeezer, stop being so arrogant.\u201dBoom!As if endless thunders were rumbling, the sky was covered by thousands of black palms, bearing down on the seven. Each palm was twice as big as the claw. Such power reached a new height that even the seven were in shock.\u201cHow can this be? Did he break through to the Sacred Stage?\u201d Sword Emperor sucked in a cold breath at the sight.As they watched, they could feel bravery leaving them.Not even seven Emperors together were a match against a Sacred stage expert.Zhao Chen\u2019s face grew paler as regret gnawing his heart. Who\u2019d have thought just a month of practice would elevate Zhuo Yifan to such height in power.\u201cHumph, damn traitor, this is the end for you.\u201d Sneered Zhuo Yifan.Whoosh!A light fell from the heavens above, piercing the black hands and went straight for Zhuo Yifan. With no time to react, the light passed right through him.Scarlet blood spurted from his mouth and the thousands of black hands vanished. Zhuo Yifan looked with his wan face at the sky to see a middle-aged man basked in a holy aura of light.\u201cSaint!\u201d Zhuo Yifan bit his lips in defiance. He knew in his heart the newcomer\u2019s intention.\u201cDemonic Emperor Zhuo Yifan, this Saint represents the Sacred Domain in retrieving the Demon Emperor\u2019s legacy. If you hand it over, your life shall be spared.\u201d The surroundings and people entered his eyes yet none of them were reflected within. He wouldn\u2019t even deign to look at Zhuo Yifan, if not for having the Nine Serenities Secret Records.This was the strongest Saint in the Sacred Domain. Even Emperor stage experts were mere ants before him.With a miserable chuckle, Zhuo Yifan took out a dazzling multi-colored jade slip from his bosom.The mere sight of it changed the expressions of everyone present, especially Saint\u2019s.With a look of derision to all around him, Zhuo Yifan jeered, \u201cWhat righteous cultivators, what Saint? Aren\u2019t you all just thieves lusting a poor man\u2019s wealth? I won\u2019t let any of you get one word from the Nine Serenities Secret Records even if I have to destroy it.\u201dAs if to prove his conviction, a powerful energy rose up from his body.\u201cDamn! He\u2019s gonna self-destruct.\u201dSword Emperor\u2019s eyes shrank speeding further away, with the other not far behind. Only the Saint exploded in holy wrath and charged for Zhuo Yifan, \u201cStop!\u201dWith a proud smile, Zhuo Yifan pinched and the jade slip was turned to dust right under the Saint\u2019s eyes. The rage and bitterness he saw in the Saint as he gnashed his teeth elicited an unrestrained laughter from Zhuo Yifan.Boom!His laughter was soon accompanied by powerful shock waves leveling the entire Devil Peak.As the smoke and dust cleared it was soon clear to see the angry face of the Saint, along with his worse for wear clothes.\u201cEven in the face of such a terrifying explosion, a Saint can come out of it without so much as a scratch.\u201d The Sword Emperor came before the Saint to express his admiration.The Saint snorted and was about to leave.It was then Zhao Chen blocked him, \u201cPlease wait, Saint. Demonic Emperor Zhuo is cunning and deceitful. If he possesses someone, just from knowing the Nine Serenities Secret Records, he will one day come to exact vengeance upon us all.\u201d\u201cHumph, his self-destruction was down to his soul. What possession?\u201d He waived his sleeve and vanished.The hearts of everyone present eased after hearing this.With a Saint present, an Emperor stage expert would find it impossible to escape with their soul even if they self-destructed. It was a pity for the loss of the ancient Demon Emperor\u2019s legacy, Nine Serenities Secret Records.As people gazed upon the ruins of Devil Peak, they each felt differently. Some were rejoicing, others lamenting, while most were feeling pity\u2026Silavin: Yo, we are picking up this novel since there are some people asking for this. I\u2019m also personally interested in this story.As for how many chapters a week, this week will have one chapter. Update you guys on the next chapter.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 - Demonic Emperor\u2019s RebirthPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 2, Demonic Emperor\u2019s RebirthIn the dead of night, even the moon\u2019s radiance was snuffed out by the black clouds.Bodies laid in a pile in a quiet part of the forest, the aftermath of a gruesome battle. The air reeked of blood drawing all kinds of wild animals to feast on their flesh.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dAmong the countless chomping sounds of animals, from amongst the bodies, a young man let out a groan.Ears twitched and the animals approached the source in silence.Thump!With a loud sound, two corpses were thrown to the side to reveal a bloodstained figure wrestling out from the pile. The animals jumped two steps back in fright, but when they noticed he was alive, they came back with a vengeance to rob life from him.Yet, the youth hardly noticed the imminent danger, still sat there in a daze.\u201cIs this\u2026 the current me?\u201d He checked his hands as his eyes glazed over.Awoo!A wolf\u2019s howl echoed as the beast sprung towards the youth.He turned his head, his eyes shining with blood thirst from his blood stained face. The killing intent was akin to two swords stabbing into the wolf\u2019s eyes.Whoosh!The wolf grounded to a halt, shivering as it curled backwards. The rest of the animals were also making a run for it when they watched those demonic pair of eyes.Despite his weak appearance, the animals\u2019 instinct screamed at them of the danger the youth posed.As silence set in once again, the youth took a deep breath and closed his eyes.His name was Zhuo Fan, fifteen years of age, a servant of the Luo clan at Cloud Manor. His life was happy and carefree, until three days ago when a band of Blackwind Mountain bandits butchered the manor. He along with some guards escorted the young master and young miss as they fled, only to find his end in this forest at the hand of their pursuers.In his final breaths, he was filled with an obsession. It was this that drew the drifting Demonic Emperor Zhuo Yifan\u2019s resentment and allowed the Demonic Emperor to possess him.Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes flashed with demonic glee.\u201cHa-ha-ha, Sword Emperor, Zhao Chen, you would have never imagined the Nine Serenities Secret Records has a way of possessing someone without the need of a soul. Wait for me, I will soon return to Sacred Domain and behead you myself. \u201cOnly Zhuo Fan\u2019s mad laughter echoed in the bleak forest. Even the other animals chewing on corpses were startled into fleeing.Cough!A sudden cough cut his raving laugher short as his eyes turned like a hawk towards the source.\u201cHe-help me!\u201dZhuo Fan rushed to it to see a Luo clan\u2019s guard buried in bodies, with blood pouring from his mouth.\u201cHumph, the affairs of mortals have nothing to do with me.\u201dHis eyes shrank and shook his head as he was about to leave. The previous Zhuo Fan would\u2019ve done his best in helping the man. But he was now replaced by the Demonic Emperor Zhuo Yifan. To Yifan, the Luo clan were nothing but ants to him.Who was so bored as to save an ant\u2019s life?He took only two steps before stopping. Recalling something, he dropped down cross-legged to inspect his body.Not a moment passed and Zhuo Fan flashed his eyes open with glee.\u201cThis kid is 15 yet has never cultivated. His body is untainted.\u201dOn the Martial Emperor Continent, most could cultivate. Even farmers would have a 1st or 2nd layer in the Foundation Establishment stage. It was rarer to find a fifteen years old who never cultivated once.And the strongest cultivation method is the Nine Serenities Secret Records \u2013 Demon Transformation Art, who could use other\u2019s cultivation and later allow one to swallow the Heavens and devour the Earth, reaching the highest realm of power in this world, needed a pure body to train in it.This cultivation method was something the Nine Serenities Emperor comprehended only after he entered the Emperor stage. Just when he was contemplating destroying his cultivation and starting anew, he suffered at the hands of the other Emperor stage experts.In ancient times, the Nine Serenities Emperor was among the top three strongest Emperors, for it to make even him consider restarting his cultivation, this cultivation method must be of treemendous might. Maybe it surpassed even a Heaven ranked cultivation method.As such, once Zhuo Yifan obtained it, he began to consider his next course of action. But before he could decide, the seven Emperors and Zhao Chen came and forced him on this path.With a pure body, the effect would be even more pronounced.At this point, Zhuo Fan returned to the guard. He removed the corpses covering him and pulled him out of the rest.Empty eyes watched as he got pulled from the brink of death. The guard smiled, \u201cAh, it\u2019s you, Zhuo Fan. Thank you, I\u2019ll repay you when we get back.\u201d\u201cHe-he-he, why wait when you can just as well do it now.\u201d With a corner of his mouth perked up, Zhuo Fan exposed an odd smile.The guard froze as a chill seized his heart.As they were both from the Luo clan, this wasn\u2019t the first time he saw Zhuo Fan. But this was his first time watching such a sinister expression. It was akin to how a wolf would set its sights on a rabbit.\u201cZhuo Fan. what are you going to do?\u201d The guard watched him vigilant.Zhuo Fan ignored him as he watched with the same smile, mumbling all the while, \u201cNot bad, a 2nd layer of Qi Condensation cultivation. Solid foundation material.\u201dWhile other cultivation methods absorbed the spiritual energy around them to refine the host\u2019s body, the Demon Transformation Art robbed others of their cultivation to further his own.But how could a normal man steal from a cultivator? When the target was wounded of course, to the point he couldn\u2019t even move.This was the reason for Zhuo Yifan\u2019s uncertainty to abolish his cultivation at the time. If such an encounter never happened, he would\u2019ve been a mortal for the rest of his life. It would end in a complete loss, something he believed caused even the Nine Serenities Emperor to hesitate at that time.Yet, here he was, with a newly possessed body that the heavens dropped on his lap. \u2018Truly something only found by luck.\u2019Seeing the insidious Zhuo Fan watching him like a rogue watched a beauty, the guard\u2019s heart never knew rest as he shouted, \u201cY-you\u2019re not Zhuo Fan!\u201d\u201cHe-he-he, correct!\u201dThe evil laughter further emphasized Zhuo Fan\u2019s malevolent look, \u201cI am the Sacred Domain\u2019s Eighth Emperor, Demonic Emperor Zhuo Yifan!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 - Demon Transformation ArtPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 3, Demon Transformation ArtThe guard watched in horror as Zhuo Fan raised a palm over his head and began operating his cultivation method.Black streams came from it, twisting like worms as they burrowed into the guard\u2019s body. The moment they entered, the guard\u2019s face changed.His horrified visage, twisted from pain, now darkened the pale face from the extreme blood loss. With each passing moment, the man inched closer to turning as black as charcoal. In the dark night, even if one didn\u2019t pay attention, no one would claim him to be a human.This perked Zhuo Fan up, riveted in excitement to the sight before him.Demon Transformation Art might take other\u2019s cultivation as his own, but when was it that easy to steal one\u2019s Yuan Qi? Even if he did, it would probably reject him. He needed to show extreme caution, especially now when he was building his foundation.Therefore, Zhuo Fan chose to first demonify it before absorbing it.Taking a deep breath to calm his excitement, his hand tightened and the black streams began to flow back from the guard into his body as the guard himself was withering in front of his naked eye.An hour later, Zhuo Fan took back his hand and sat cross-legged, beginning to refine the new Yuan Qi.The guard collapsed and scattered to ashes. It was as if an ancient corpse was unearthed only to scatter in the wind the moment they made contact.Nine Serenities Emperor\u2019s creation not only took other\u2019s cultivation but also their essence.The black energy roamed around his body like a flood. Zhuo Fan sank into concentration as he operated the cultivation method to make the energy flow through his meridians and widening little by little.The entire power of a Qi Condensation expert flowed through his untrained body. The force was on the verge of bursting his meridians as his forehead broke out in sweat.But he pushed through because he knew this power could build a never before seen foundation. Such a stable foundation would guarantee an easier and smoother path of cultivation.Time passed one second at a time for two hours long hours, as Zhuo Fan gnashed his teeth and sweat poured from him like a river\u2026He loosened his jaw only on the sixth hour, when the black energy, after roaming his body for hundreds of times, gathered in his Dantian and settled in the form of a black lake.He slowly opened his eyes and released a long breath. The clouds in the horizon began to brighten, and the stuffed wild animals returned to the depths of the forest.\u201cIt\u2019s dawn? Ha-ha-ha, I didn\u2019t expect for a 2nd layer Qi Condensation\u2019s cultivation would require an entire night.\u201dZhuo Fan shook his head and examined his body.Bang!A loud sound echoed and the rock crumbled under the Zhuo Fan\u2019s frail punch.Zhuo Fan nodded in satisfaction. The Qi Condensation expert\u2019s cultivation refined his body and improved it greatly. Based on his body strength alone, he was no weaker than a Qi Condensation expert.Next he inspected his cultivation.He was calm before, but that look scared the living daylight out of him.As for his cultivation, not only did it reach the 5th layer of Foundation Establishment, the Yuan Qi inside him was that of Qi Condensation, and not of Foundation Establishment.\u201cMan, this Demon Transformation Art is fantastic.\u201d Zhuo Fan couldn\u2019t help smacking his lips, being secretly delighted.Generally speaking, even those rare geniuses from the Sacred Domain needed a year to reach the 5th layer of Foundation Establishment. Yet, he needed one night to do what others had to work for two-three years to attain.\u201cIt won\u2019t be long before I return to the Sacred Domain. He-he-he\u2026\u201d Zhuo Fan snickered.Just as he was indulging in his fantasy when he returned, shouts woke him up.Frowning, he walked cautiously in their direction. He was clear on his limitations. Even if he had a 5th layer Foundation Establishment cultivation, this little achievement couldn\u2019t deal with the simplest martial skill. He had no power to retaliate if he met an expert.As such, being prudent took first priority. After all, he wasn\u2019t the all-powerful Demonic Emperor right now.With steps as light as a cat, he neared a bush. Zhuo Fan pushed aside the leaves to see two parties in a stalemate.One had more than a dozen men, Luo clan\u2019s guards surrounding an eighteen-year-old girl and a six-year-old boy.The other group wore black and was led by an old man, over twenty people. The man was familiar to Zhuo Fan. He recalled seeing him in the Luo clan as their steward. Then the pair surrounded by the guards had to be Luo clan\u2019s young master, Luo Yunhai, and young miss, Luo Yunchang.\u201cHumph, no wonder the mountain bandits breached the tight security of the Luo clan guards, we had a traitor amongst us. \u201cZhuo Fan sneered inside. He recalled his disciple and clenched his fists.In his past life, he was betrayed by his disciples, and the one he possessed now died from a similar result. He couldn\u2019t help relating a bit to the body he occupied.But he soon shook his head and sighed, ready to turn around and leave.With his strength, he had no way of helping them. Besides, there was nothing tying him to the Luo clan. It just wasn\u2019t worth throwing his life away for.Yet, he only took two steps before his heart seized with pain. The third step never came.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 - Heart DemonPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 4, Heart DemonIn fear, Zhuo Fan tightened a hand over his chest. The pain was so excruciating, it brought him to his knees, mumbling, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Did my cultivation deviate?\u201dHis heart welled with panic. If he deviated right as he built his foundation, the result wasn\u2019t as simple as losing all progress. He would never again be capable of cultivation, he would become a cripple.But the pain left as soon as it came.Zhuo Fan stood up and took a deep breath. He couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of it.Yet the next step brought with it the same heartache!\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t deviation but\u2026 heart demon!\u201dThinking of this, he began to look for the source of the heart demon. If a cultivator ignored it, he wasn\u2019t far from deviating and becoming a demon.Zhuo Fan soon found its source, but the result left him feeling discontent.Before being possessed, Zhuo Fan was a devoted servant. Luo clan\u2019s young miss was very kind to him and so he pledged life-long devotion to the clan. The resentment before death was born out of regret of not protecting the Luo clan.It was then the Demonic Emperor\u2019s hatred and his resentment fused, possessing his soul and breathing life into his body. And his resentment became a contract with the Demonic Emperor, turning into his shackles.In short, the Demonic Emperor lived so he could replace him in protecting the Luo clan, or the heart demon would haunt him.\u201cBlast it! This punk is the worst. He wants me to be a servant?\u201d Zhuo Fan wanted to cry but no tears came out as he kept cursing.How could the glorious and magnificent Demonic Emperor Zhuo Yifan, the Eighth Emperor of the Sacred Domain, be tied down by some nameless clan?Yet the heart demon couldn\u2019t be ignored either.Helpless, he caressed his forehead, \u201cIt would be better if a punk like you wished for vengeance instead. This way, it would\u2019ve taken me a few years to kill him. Yet\u2026 you went and ruined my life.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s there? Show yourself!\u201dAn aged voice shouted and Zhuo Fan sensed a thick killing intent aimed at his location.Shaking his head, he sighed and walked out.Since he got found out, he might as well go deal with that traitorous Steward Sun\u2026Seeing who it was, Steward Sun smiled with derision, \u201cHumph, I wondered who it could be, when in fact it was just a little bastard.\u201dThen Steward Sun turned to Luo Yunchang, paying him no heed.\u201cYoung miss, I advise you to hand over the Returning Dragon Palm martial art to avoid any unnecessary casualties. I don\u2019t think you want that either.\u201d\u201cRubbish, geezer Sun, you traitor. As long as we\u2019re here, you won\u2019t harm a single hair on young miss and young master.\u201d The Luo clan\u2019s guard captain took a step forward.Luo Yunchang glared back, her pretty face filled with resolve, \u201cSteward Sun, Returning Dragon Palm is a spirit ranked martial art handed down in the Luo clan for generations. We will never hand it over.\u201dZhuo Fan snorted inside.He was wondering why the mountain bandits raided the Luo clan. It was all for a mere spirit ranked martial art.On the Martial Emperor Continent, all cultivation methods and martial arts were divided into five ranks: spirit, profound, earth and heaven. Each in turn was split in low, mid and high. In Sacred Domain, spirit ranked martial arts were at every corner and mere trash in the eyes of a Demonic Emperor such as himself. He had thousands of them already.It was a total waste to die for such junk.Zhuo Fan sighed and shouted bored, \u201cYoung miss, it\u2019s just a spirit ranked martial art. Just give it to him and I\u2019ll just give you another.\u201dAll eyes quivered in shock, then looked at him like a nut case.\u201cZhuo Fan, quite the cheeky tone you have there. Taking out a random spirit ranked martial art? On what grounds can a fifteen-year-old Luo clan servant do that? Ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201dSteward Sun threw his head back and laughed, eyes filled with mockery. Even the bandits followed with their taunting laughter, not hiding their ridicule.While the guards looked at him in doubt. Even his former friends familiar with him looked oddly.[This kid is usually honest. Why does he speak nonsense all of a sudden? Did the mountain bandits scared him silly?][Eh, that must be it!]With that, all guards changed their looks into those of sympathy.Zhuo Fan saw through them and just shrugged. His repertoire wasn\u2019t limited to spirit ranked martial art, and even included Demon Emperor\u2019s ancient art, the Nine Serenities Secret Records. But they\u2019d never believe him.\u201cZhuo Fan, enough nonsense. Hurry up and look after the young master.\u201dZhuo Fan turned at the scolding voice to find Luo Yunchang in a mask of rage. But her eyes conveyed a trace of pity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As they were speaking, she was looking for a chance to hide him behind the guards.\u201cWhat are you waiting for? Get him over here before he humiliates us further.\u201d Luo Yunchang shouted at the guards.Before anyone even moved, a bloody blade rested on Zhuo Fan\u2019s neck.\u201cWait!\u201dSteward Sun snickered, his eyes piercing through Luo Yunchang\u2019s as he had figured out her plan. \u201cHe-he-he, young miss is as kind as ever, wanting to save even a mentally unstable servant.\u201dLuo Yunchang raged, \u201cSteward Sun, you won\u2019t let even the demented live?\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, right back at you. If you don\u2019t want the innocent to die, take out the Returning Dragon Palm. We don\u2019t care if our blades get slick with the blood of one more man.\u201dWith that, the bandit brushed the edge along Zhuo Fan\u2019s face and sported a bloodthirsty grin.Luo Yunchang pursed her lips, hesitation visible in her eyes, yet still decided to close them.Zhuo Fan understood.Although the young miss had no plan to save him by taking the martial art out, as his mistress, it filled him with gratitude just from hesitating.But in the end, it would come down to him if he could save himself.Taking a look back at the bandit, he found a fat man of the same height at 7th layer of Foundation Establishment.[It should be doable!]Zhuo Fan clenched his fist and gathered Yuan Qi in his left, eyes flashing with ruthlessness.\u201cHumph, since you\u2019re so stubborn, Zhuo Fan will be the first to die because of you.\u201d Steward Sun\u2019s hand dropped, staring at Luo Yunchang\u2019s pain-filled eyes, \u201cFatty, kill him.\u201dHe grinned, and raised the blade way up high.It was then that a thump echoed out, soon followed by bone snapping along with the fat man\u2019s wails.His blade had long ago slipped from his hand.Zhuo Fan picked it up and decapitated the man.Blood spurted and a large head trailed the air.Zhuo Fan was only in the 5th layer of Foundation Establishment, yet his Yuan Qi was something only a Qi Condensation expert would possess. In a moment of the fat man\u2019s ignorance, he elbowed his chest and snapped his ribcage.He followed with a swing of the sword in one smooth motion.None could even react as the fat man\u2019s head flew from his shoulder.Plop!The bloody head rolled around and stopped right before Steward Sun.He looked dumbly at the familiar face, incredulous of the outcome.He saw Zhuo Fan grow up in the Luo clan and knew the kind of person he was. He was honest to a fault, a slave begging to be picked on.Yet this sheep bared its fangs like a tiger, killing a 7th layer Foundation Establishment expert in one strike. It was done with such brutality that it even shook the bandits.The guards on Luo clan\u2019s side were even more devastated. Was he the same man they used to laugh with, the same honest to god Zhuo Fan? Leaving the kill aside, his quick and brutal act was something not even the captain of the guards could match.Every single one of them stood in shock, watching dumbly as blood dripped down Zhuo Fan\u2019s blade, to the point they forgot even to breathe.If Zhuo Fan didn\u2019t take this chance to leave, he\u2019d never get another.Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes squinted, pressed his advantage and threw the bloody saber at Steward Sun. all the while running for young miss and young master. By the time the saber arrived, he was already before Luo Yunchang.One hand held Luo Yunhai while the other grabbed her, running like hell deeper into the forest.Luo Yunchang was still in a daze, letting him pull her.Steward Sun saw the target slipping away again and panicked, \u201cAfter them!\u201dBut the captain and his guards were there to block them.\u201cHumph, think you can stop us?\u201d Steward Sun said with cruelty.The captain smiled and shook his head, \u201cNo, but we can buy them some time for them to get away.\u201d\u201cHe-he-he, with you dead, you still think they can escape?\u201dTaking one last look in their direction, the captain nodded, \u201cIf it was before, perhaps no. But they have that boy.\u201dThe guards nodded, with their trust in Zhuo Fan beginning to grow in their hearts.They might not know why Zhuo Fan was so bold all of a sudden, but with him next to the young miss and young master, their chances of survival were high.Gnashing his teeth, Steward Sun looked darkly beyond them, \u201cThat brat dares to meddle in my affairs. Once I get my hands on him, I will flay him. I\u2019ll make him wish for death!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhuo Fan stopped and stared her down.\u201cWe need to go back. We can\u2019t let the guards throw their life away for us. \u201d\u201cCan you beat them?\u201d said Zhuo Fan.Luo Yunchang sighed with a frown, \u201cThe others are bad enough, but they have Steward Sun, in the 6th layer of Qi Condensation while I am only in the 3rd layer and the captain in the 4th. Even if we join forces, we are still no match for him.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of returning then? Let\u2019s go.\u201dZhuo Fan snorted and grabbed her again to dash.It was now that the child in his other hand squirmed, \u201cStinky slave, how dare you talk back to your master. Apologize to my sister and I won\u2019t let you butt blossom in pain.\u201dZhuo Fan looked in a daze, the pup bearing his fangs in his arm then looked at Luo Yunchang. The young miss was angry. Recalling he was but a mere servant of the Luo clan, only now did his disrespectful words sink in .But so what? He wasn\u2019t the real Zhuo Fan anyway.Moreover, they weren\u2019t exactly the same revered Luo clan either. [Your family is on the brink of being exterminated yet you have time to nitpick?]If not for the heart demon, the majestic Demonic Emperor would have never even minded your trifling matters!\u201cBrat, think I won\u2019t make your butt blossom?\u201d Zhuo Fan stared at Luo Yunhai.\u201cYou dare, slave!\u201d Luo Yunhai glared back without fear. He grew up in the manor and knew of the gap in their status. How could he ever come to fear a servant\u2019s threat?Such a pity the one before him wasn\u2019t Luo clan\u2019s servant.With a grin, Zhuo Fan bent him over the knee, pulled his pants and slapped like no tomorrow.The sonorous slaps rang in their ears, striking Luo Yunhai and Luo Yunchang dumb. They never dreamed of this ever happening. A servant daring to slap a master\u2019s bum.To the point even the bratty Luo Yunhai forgot about the pain. But he soon got a taste of the scorching sting on his rear.\u201cImpudent!\u201dLuo Yunchang cried in alarm, wrestling her brother from him and into her embrace, \u201cZhuo Fan, you dare raise your hand against your master?\u201dLuo Yunchang was known in the clan for her gentle nature, and warm and refined demeanor, a girl from a wealthy family that never got angry. But Zhuo Fan\u2019s act took the cake and made the rage inside her burn like never before.Zhuo Fan avoided her eyes as he sneered, \u201cNot as daring as young miss. To the point of wasting time berating others while the enemy is just around the corner.\u201dThe noise behind them was getting weaker. Zhuo Fan and Luo Yunchang were clear the guards couldn\u2019t hold on much longer.\u201cI only slapped him a few times, but if you do not run, those men will soon take his life.\u201d Zhuo Fan pointed at Luo Yunhai.Luo Yunhai was still angry but Zhuo Fan\u2019s words struck close to home. Her brother was the only male left in the clan. She could sacrifice herself, but nothing must happen to him.After some thought, she became serious, \u201cZhuo Fan, take young master and leave while I stall them.\u201d\u201cI refuse!\u201d blurted Zhuo Fan, \u201cIf you dare leave, I will kill this brat.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dShe was at a loss for words. Never would she have imagined her clan would house such an arrogant and impudent servant that would dare threaten their master.\u201cI\u2019ve lived in the Luo clan for all my life and do not know the surrounding. If you leave, me and the brat won\u2019t make it.\u201d Zhuo Fan continued.Luo Yunchang nodded in silence, her anger cooling. It made sense. But the next words flamed her anger to new heights, staring daggers at him.\u201cIt won\u2019t mean much even if you die, but try not to take me down with you..\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Luo Yunchang turned green, but held it in.He ignored the pair and turned to walk, \u201cIs there any place nearby where we can hide?\u201dSnorting, Luo Yunchang glared at him while ignoring the insufferable servant.But she was a young miss after all and even though her anger never waned, she still knew to look past it in this dangerous situation, \u201cThere\u2019s only farmland around us for a hundred miles and only the west face of the Blackwind Mountain is the only place few people venture in. It is a forest covered in fog that not even the mountain bandits know in detail.\u201d\u201cThen, That\u2019s where we\u2019ll go.\u201dZhuo Fan nodded, \u201cCarry your brother and lead the way.\u201dShe snorted and walked forward without sparing him another look.Just how could she stumble upon such bad luck, where the two siblings were now accompanied by an arrogant and rotten slave. She was in front and he was in the back, it was as if the master-servant roles were reversed.Never had the siblings suffered such humiliation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Any who enters will find it hard to come out.\u201d Luo Yunchang hesitated, \u201cWe might lose them there, but we might also get lost for all eternity.\u201dZhuo Fan didn\u2019t pay her much heed, inspecting the area, especially the mountain in the east, which was surrounded by clouds.\u201cIs that Blackwind Mountain?\u201dLuo Yunchang nodded, \u201cMy dad said Blackwind Mountain\u2019s Mountain Lord has great power, no less than his. Our clans have been fine for decades yet, for some reason, their bandits attacked out manor.\u201d\u201cHe-he-he, good place!\u201d Zhuo Fan rubbed his chin, showing heartfelt admiration.\u201cAzure Dragon in the East, White Tiger in the West, Vermilion Bird in the South, Black Tortoise in the North, and Qilin\u2019s horn in the center, breaking the sky!\u201cThis is a natural array!\u201d Zhuo Fan mumbled, \u201cSuch a pity, no one knowledgeable discovered it. Now that I\u2019m here, I\u2019ll make this place my second Devil Mountain!\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s eyes flashed with joy.He was clear of this mountain\u2019s value. If this was Sacred Domain, only a Saint could grab hold of such a place.\u201cYoung miss, want to kill Steward Sun and the rest here?\u201d Zhuo Fan turned his head.Luo Yunchang was startled.They only numbered three while a strong party was hunting them down and they had hardly enough time to escape. Just how were they going to destroy them?Luo Yunhai snorted and smiled wryly at Zhuo Fan, \u201cStinky slave, stop bragging!\u201d\u201cIs your butt itchy again?\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s glare stuck Luo Yunhai\u2019s words in his throat. That round of slapping to his rear told him this servant couldn\u2019t care less for this young master.\u201cHumph, a wise man knows when to retreat. Once I get home, I\u2019ll see how tough you are!\u201d He mumbled on his sister\u2019s shoulder.With her brother in her arms and to avoid the vile servant\u2019s wrath, Luo Yunchang asked in doubt, \u201cHow?\u201dWith a light smile, Zhuo Fan extended his arm, \u201cYoung miss, how many spirit stones do you have? Please give them all to me.\u201d\u201cWhat do you need them for?\u201d Luo Yunchang watched him with a vigilant eye.\u201cHa-ha-ha, young miss misunderstands, I\u2019m not trying to take advantage of a declined clan and turn into an evil servant that robs it. All my actions are for your safety.\u201d\u201cHumph, still consider yourself a loyal servant? The way I see it, there\u2019s not a viler servant out there who can outmatch you.\u201dLuo Yunchang rubbed her pitiful brother\u2019s butt, as she thought that, but still gave him her ring, \u201cThis is all my wealth. If you dare lie to me, I will never forgive you.\u201dZhuo Fan took it with a smile and sank in the mist.\u201cWait for me here.\u201d\u201cHumph, this servant is too outrageous. He even dares to order his master! Sister, you need to punish him for me!\u201d Luo Yunhai raved once the servant was gone.She shook her head and looked at the roaming mist, \u201cYunhai, he might be rude, but he\u2019s always helping us, much better than those strong hypocrites. We can\u2019t reward kindness with enmity. \u201dLuo Yunhai thought for a moment then nodded, \u201cYes, it\u2019s all that damned Steward Sun\u2019s fault.\u201dLuo Yunchang was pleased and praised him, \u201cYunhai, you\u2019re growing up.\u201dBut then he hissed through his teeth, \u201cAs for that stinky slave, he should be spanked like no tomorrow. Killing him is too easy for him!\u201dLuo Yunchang was silent.Zhuo Fan walked among the white fog, his deep eyes taking in his surroundings. From time to time, his hand flashed and a spirit stone flew out from the ring and disappeared into the ground.Despite it being his first time here, he was remarkably familiar with its layout. His path never once was disturbed by the fog.In but a quarter of an hour, he traveled across the entire forest.\u201cNine Underworld Gates open! Four Cardinal Wraith Array activate!\u201dHis hands made signs with lightning speed, while he spoke the incantation from the Nine Serenities Secret Records.The wind shifted and the sky darkened. With wails, gray shadows fell from the sky and hid in the Misty Forest.The fog reddened, then blackened, the same color as the sky.Constant shrieks came out.The siblings held closer to each other, shaking in fear while taking steps back for some semblance of comfort.Yet the wails and shriek stopped as soon as they started while the sky cleared up and even the sun peeked through the clouds. Misty Forest\u2019s fog dissipated and revealed a gasping Zhuo Fan walking over.\u201cWhat just happened? What did you do?\u201d Luo Yunchang watched him with bewilderment.He only waved and entered the forest.\u201cFollow me.\u201dLuo Yunchang was suspicious, however she led her brother behind. Zhuo Fan had a mysterious appearance that made the two not voice their doubts.When they arrived at an ancient tree, Zhuo Fan said, \u201cStay below this tree for now. I will teach you how to control the Wraith Array and when Steward Sun comes, you can use it to kill them.\u201d\u201cWhat!? This is an array?\u201dLuo Yunchang was stunned.Arrays were even more precious than martial arts in this world. No sect would ever dare release even a normal array to outside. Even if the auction had a 1st grade array, it would still sell for hundreds of thousands spirit stones. They were rare and in high demand.If their Cloud Manor had a protective array, they would\u2019ve never sunk so low from mere bandits.Yet, at this very moment, a mere servant casually set up an array. It was impossible that this feat would result in the young miss being shocked silly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This is a bewildering array which can affect the perceptions of others inside. And this is also a killing array, controlling wraiths to kill your enemies.\u201dLuo Yunchang copied stiffly as Zhuo Fan performed the gestures. However, he was too fast. She could only watch him do it as she fumbled to a stop. Unable to remember the movements as he carried on, stuck on the last sign she did.\u201cSigh, how are you so slow? This is the simplest method!\u201d Zhuo Fan got angry and cursed, \u201cIf you keep going like this, Steward Sun will be upon us. We might as well just serve ourselves on a silver platter. You\u2019re as slow as a pig.\u201dAll her life, Luo Yunchang was handled with finesse and attention a pearl would need. She received others love and respect. Never has she been mistreated like this, degraded to such a degree.Glittering tears started welling in her eyes as she lowered her head. Yet, she persevered.Seeing his sister humiliated, he found courage and shouted at Zhuo Fan, \u201cStinky slave, don\u2019t mock my sister.\u201dZhuo Fan just shook his head, not having the time to bicker with the brat.He found his Yuan Qi was only enough to start the array, failing to control it.If one were to speak of a complete Wraith Array, even if none of them controlled it, a trash like Steward Sun would end up beaten to a pulp either way. However, he only had around a thousand spirit stones. If not for being a natural array, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to set even a damaged one.It was now in the hands of 3rd layer Qi Condensation young miss to control the array.But for her, the method was long and complicated. It was hard to grasp. Worse, they were on the clock.Helpless, Zhuo Fan embraced her from behind and took hold of her hands.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Luo Yunchang froze up as her cheek blossomed with red.\u201cDon\u2019t move and let me guide you.\u201d Zhuo Fan led her hands and taught her the signs.Despite catching his intent, being embraced by an unfamiliar man threw her heart in chaos and cheeks burned hotter, since this was the first time it ever happened to her.Each time her mind drifted, a voice would ring in her ear, \u201cPay attention.\u201dShe peeked at him and saw how serious Zhuo Fan was, that his actions were not aimed to take advantage of her.[Humph, he knows when to be a gentleman!]Luo Yunchang calmed down and her body drew nearer to his. Feeling the strong arm behind her, this was the first time in the last three days she felt safe.\u201cSteward Sun. they went towards the Misty Forest.\u201d Ten miles outside the Misty Forest, a lanky bandit checked for tracks and reported to him.With cold laughter, Steward Sun straightened his white moustache, \u201cQuite a good hiding place. We know the mountain area but not that eerie place. However\u2026\u201dSteward Sun looked at the bound captain and his eyes flash with an evil glint.\u201cCaptain Pang, you\u2019re up soon. With how kind young miss is, she won\u2019t ignore your pleas.\u201d\u201cPtooey, don\u2019t think you can use me to threaten young miss.\u201d His eyes were bloodshot as he glared at Steward Sun.\u201cYou\u2019d better kill me, or I will murder you and avenge my fellow guards.\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, when I get the martial skill, I\u2019ll be happy to fulfill your wish.\u201d Squinting his eyes, Steward Sun let out a creepy laughter. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dIt took an hour for their group of twenty to reach Misty Forest.Yet before they could get any closer, snoring came from a man sleeping against a tree. A careful look identified him as Zhuo Fan.\u201cSteward Sun, it\u2019s the one who killed the fatty.\u201dWoken up by the voice, Zhuo Fan yawned and opened his weary eyes. Seeing Steward Sun and co., he showed no fear, no anxiety. Instead, a smile.\u201cSteward Sun, I\u2019ve waited so long to see you.\u201dFrowning, Steward Sun watched him. He eyed him with utmost care yet nothing seemed to tell him anything. He was just calm.\u201cWhat a deep-rooted schemer you are. I underestimated you,\u201d thought Steward Sun.If it were any other time, he would\u2019ve never paid attention to a servant.But ever since Steward Sun witnessed Zhuo Fan kill so brutally, Steward Sun\u2019s image of him turned upside-down. [This punk not only hid deeply, but he\u2019s also ruthless. If he matures, only suffering awaits.]\u201cZhuo Fan, you\u2019ve quite the nerve to show off before me,\u201d squinted Steward Sun at him.Zhuo Fan cut to the chase instead of replying, \u201cSteward Sun, want to make a deal?\u201d\u201cWhat deal?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you the Luo clan\u2019s young master and mistress. So, secure my career in Blackwind Mountain.\u201d[What?]Not only was Steward Sun shocked, but even the guard captain was also dumbfounded.He rested his hopes on Zhuo Fan to take the siblings far away. Who\u2019d have thought Zhuo Fan would defect and use them as bargaining chips.\u201cWhy are you doing this? Luo clan hasn\u2019t scorn you,\u201d doubts arose in Steward Sun\u2019s heart.\u201cHa-ha-ha, then why do you? Luo clan treated you even better.\u201dSteward Sun reddened at this and felt his rage boiling.As he calmed himself, Zhuo Fan continued,\u201dEvery man for himself. With how much the Luo clan has fallen, reviving it isn\u2019t something one man can do. Why should I walk towards my death? Using them to secure my life is but human nature.\u201dHe picked the red rope from the ground who followed into the mist.\u201cYoung miss is at one of the ends of the rope. I left a few forks on the rope along the way that only I know about.\u201dSteward Sun nodded as he grabbed it, \u201cGood plan, to use a rope to mark your way. And you even included forks to safeguard the right trail for yourself. A true double-crosser, ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201dHe gave the rope back, \u201cDeal, lead the way. But don\u2019t even think of playing tricks.\u201d\u201cSteward Sun, I am an honest man!\u201d smiled Zhuo Fan.Steward Sun sneered, \u201cI would\u2019ve believed you before but now\u2026 who would!?\u201dThe two locked their eyes, each laughing as their looks hid devious thoughts.The captain\u2019s hair stood on end. He kept cursing Steward Sun as a rotten and vile human, while he barked at Zhuo Fan as one who betrayed their master.

Zhuo Fan went first with Steward Sun right behind him. Holding onto him with a firm grip on to prevent the boy from escaping.Because of the thick mist, one couldn\u2019t even see the figure of the one in front and relied on their hands to feel their neighbor.At the heart of the Misty Forest, where it was impossible for anyone to escape, Zhuo Fan stopped.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Steward Sun was feeling apprehensive, tightening his grip on Zhuo Fan\u2019s clothes.With a snicker, Zhuo Fan said, \u201cSteward Sun, we\u2019ll be paring here. It\u2019s best if you travel the Underworld River without me.\u201dWith acute fear, Steward Sun discovered he fell in Zhuo Fan\u2019s trap. He pulled Zhuo Fan close and slapped him.The clothes were turned to ribbons, but instead of Zhuo Fan, they held a log.\u2018W-when did he escape?\u2019He\u2019d been holding tight on Zhuo Fan to prevent his escape, yet reality showed the opposite.\u201cTurn back, quick!\u201d Steward Sun rushed from where they came.As soon as he shouted, the men used the rope to retrace their path.But then, a shout came from the mist, \u201cThe rope has been cut!\u201dIt was as if lightning struck them and they all turned pale. How would they get out of this thick mist without the rope?Steward Sun stomped as he gnashed his teeth, \u201cBlast it!

Don\u2019t think a puny Misty Forest can trap me.\u201d Steward Sun roared towards the sky. \u201cOnce I get out! I\u2019ll tear you to pieces!\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, you\u2019ll never have the chance.\u201dWith Zhuo Fan\u2019s mad laughter as the signal, the mist reddened.\u201cWhy is the mist turning red?\u201dThey were in shock by the sudden change. They were bandits that killed people for a living, yet these strange circumstances had them on edge.\u201cSteward Sun, you are wiser than most\u2026 Can you tell us what this is?\u201dEven though the bandit shouted, only silence echoed back. He felt around him yet touched no one, as if everyone around him vanished and left him all alone.He wasn\u2019t the only one. The people that hung on to the rope began to vanish one at a time.Steward Sun could hardly believe what was happening, \u201cC-can this be\u2026 an array?\u201dOne as old as Steward Sun has seen many things and experienced even more, yet the more he knew, the more he realized how terrible arrays were and fear\u2019s grip his heart.An array worked using Heaven and Earth\u2019s energy. As long as a man controlled it, it could wipe out a dozen equal to him in power. Even if tens of experts gathered, they still could not measure to its power.Of all the possibilities he thought of, not once did he consider being trapped in an array.\u201cZhuo Fan, w-who exactly are you?\u201dSteward Sun trembles from the feeling of dread.He saw at last that Zhuo Fan wasn\u2019t just any ordinary man, how could a simple man know how to use or set up arrays? If Zhuo Fan had taken out an array when they met, he wouldn\u2019t have had the nerve to chase him.Standing in the center of the array, Luo Yunchang was clear of the situation. Her eyes drifted to Zhuo, filled with intrigue.Squinting, Zhuo Fan kept a cold and callous expression as he said:\u201cKill them!\u201dShe followed his order by following his hand signs.The blood-red fog changed again, this time black, and swallowed all that laid within. Now they couldn\u2019t even see themselves.Only their ears picked the mournful wails of thousands of wraiths.With fear as their only companion, they lost all their will to resist once the black streams of energy started burrowing inside them.They felt their soul devoured yet were powerless to resist.All succumbed to terror at this point.Smirking, Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes shined with glee. He left Luo Yunchang and sat cross-legged in another center of the array.The Nine Serenities Secret Records stated that the Demon Transformation Art user had a backdoor into all arrays.The men in the array were driven mad, and all he needed to do now was to absorb their Yuan Qi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Steward Sun and the rest became pitch-black but still had a sliver of awareness left as black shadows left their body.Each time one flew out, it evoked cries of torment as if pieces were ripped from its body. When the last shadow left, the cries stopped and so did their life. Their body dried up like a mummy and they turned to dust.In the darkness, the shadows returned like bees to Zhuo Fan and entered his body.He accepted them with a calm face and soon his body turned black just like Steward Sun did. When the last shadow burrowed, he began doing hand signs to practice the Demon Transformation Art.The still black Yuan Qi inside him boiled as it charged through his meridians and settled in his Dantian. And his power grew with it.In an instant, he entered the 6th layer of Foundation Establishment.In the next instant, he was in the 7th.And then, he was at peak 7th layer.He kept going like this through the 8th layer, then the 9th, until the peak of Foundation Establishment.He opened his eyes and took a deep breath as he clenched his hands, feeling the power course through him.This time, it wasn\u2019t as easy. The wraiths were almost spent when he demonified the Yuan Qi for himself. But with his experience as a veteran demonic cultivator, he understood that breaking through in a state of exhausted Yuan Qi, holds much more value with his future progress.He clenched his teeth and operated the cultivation method. He sucked the wraiths dry and used the remaining Yuan Qi he had to make one final push.Bang!Zhuo Fan heard something explode. He felt as if a dam broke and his body coursed with powerful Yuan Qi then settled in his Dantian to replenish his spent reserves.This act of scraping for the last traces of energy enlarged his meridians by more than double.Qi Condensation!Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes opened with glee.Even when he did this in his previous life, his meridians were nowhere near as wide as they were now. And the Yuan Qi in his Dantian allowed him to face an expert at Qi Condensation. He was three times as powerful as before.He released a long breath and made some hand signs to release the wraiths. They turned back to gray and he went back to normal.When all wraiths were gone, Zhuo Fan stood up and a single wave from his hands pushed away the black fog. Allowing the sun\u2019s rays to land on the forest.He could now control the array himself, no longer needing Luo Yunchang\u2019s assistance.He showed a small smile as he looked at the sky, \u201cNow that I\u2019m in the Qi Condensation, I can practice some martial arts!\u201dDespite the end of Steward Sun and his retinue of bandits, Zhuo Fan had managed to free the Luo clan siblings. It could be said Zhuo Fan benefited the most out of this. Without devouring Steward Sun, he would have never reached Qi Condensation.It was at this stage that he could practice martial arts. Later, not only could he defend himself, but also easier to devour others, becoming stronger himself.\u201cZhuo Fan.\u201dA clear shout came from Luo Yunchang as she came over, embracing her brother. Meanwhile, the guard captain followed behind. \u201cWhere did you run off to? Why did I lose control of the array?\u201d\u201cUh, perhaps there were too few spirit stones and the array collapsed. I just saw Steward Sun die. This is worthy of celebration. No one escaped,\u201d dodged Zhuo Fan.He wasn\u2019t about to reveal his secret, because in this world, demonic cultivators were strong, uncanny and cultivated with shocking speed.And his Demon Transformation Art was even more monstrous. If others knew, he\u2019d be a public enemy. This was why he died last time. So, for his second life, he made sure to avoid any mistakes.Luo Yunchang nodded, believing him.After some hesitation, Captain Pang toughened his resolve and kneeled.\u201cBrother Zhuo Fan, I was too reckless before, unaware of your plan and still cursed you. If you must punish me, I will accept any that you might have for me. Even if you ask for my head, I will gladly offer it. \u201cZhuo Fan nodded inside.Captain Pang was a loyal retainer. If Zhao Chen had this level of devotion, Zhuo Fan wouldn\u2019t have fallen so low.Sighing inside, he helped Captain Pang up, \u201cCaptain Pang is a captain of the guards while I am just a mere servant. How could I receive such courtesy? Moreover, we have young miss to thank for setting up an array to eliminate Steward Sun\u2019s group.\u201dLuo Yunchang watched him, confused. Only nodding when he threw Luo Yunchang a look.Although Luo Yunchang didn\u2019t know why Zhao Chen avoided admitting he was the one who set the array, he did save her and still deferred for her opinion.Captain Pang turned to Luo Yunchang in shock, \u201cYoung miss knows arrays?\u201dLuo Yunchang laughed, embarrassed, forced to admit it.\u201cHeaven protected the Luo clan! Young miss knows arrays, our rise is imminent!\u201d Captain Pang threw his head back and laughed, exhilarated by the prospect.Zhuo Fan rubbed his nose.Luo Yunchang stole a glance at Zhuo Fan, [If Luo clan is to rise, it\u2019s only thanks to this man.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 - Entering Windgaze CityPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 11, Entering Windgaze CityZhuo Fan understood her and quickly said, \u201cNow that we no longer have Steward Sun breathing down our necks, what does young miss intend to do next?\u201d\u201cUh, we were planning on seeking shelter at Cai Manor!\u201d Captain Pang spoke before she could.This captain of the guards no longer treated Zhuo Fan as a common servant, but of equal status.\u201cYou should know that Cai clan\u2019s young master has a marriage agreement with young miss.\u201d\u201cHmm, Windgaze City\u2019s Cai clan?\u201dZhuo Fan rubbed his chin, nodding.According to this body\u2019s memories, Cai clan was the best clan in the Windgaze City, of the same power as Luo clan. If he could hand over the Luo siblings to them, then the grudge would be settled and his heart demon lightened. Maybe it could even be dispelled.Zhuo Fan nodded at this thought, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go to the Cai clan.\u201dBut not before he took one last look at Blackwind Mountain, mumbling, \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201dAt the same time, in a dark cave atop Blackwind Mountain, a malevolent youth was on a large seat. His eyes were filled with cruelty as they flicked to his subordinate, \u201cAny news of Steward Sun?\u201d\u201cR-reporting to young lord, Steward Sun said he\u2019d soon have the martial art.\u201d The bandit was shaking like a leaf, fearing to even meet the youth\u2019s eyes.\u201cHa-ha-ha, withdraw.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d The bandit wiped the sweat from his head, not lingering one moment more if he could help it, from fear of being eaten.The youth rose and moved behind the cover placed at the back of his seat. An old man laid there, glaring with fury at him. His lips trembled but no words came out.The youth patted the man\u2019s hand with a smile, \u201cMaster, be at ease, your friend left first and is waiting for you. Once Returning Dragon Palm arrives, I will reunite you two old friends.\u201dThe old man\u2019s eyes were bloodshot at this, as if wanting to eat him alive. Despite the constant trembling, he could do nothing else.In response, the youth\u2019s savage and vicious laughter echoed throughout the cave\u2026Windgaze City was the largest city in a hundred miles and a ten day-journey from the Luo clan. From fear of other bandits pursuing them, Zhuo Fan and the others sped up and reached it in five.Once inside, the bustling of the city assaulted them while also bringing some comfort. All the tension accumulated over these past days seemed to seep from them.Now that she was finally around other people, Luo Yunchang\u2019s strained face finally revealed a smile.\u201cYunhai, look there!\u201d pulling his hand, she pointed at a juggling stall.Captain Pang was happy to know the fall of the young miss\u2019 clan didn\u2019t put a damper on her spirits, \u201cBrother Zhuo Fan, I seem to recall you never came to Windgaze City.\u201dZhuo Fan just nodded.Captain Pang was stunned at that.Windgaze City\u2019s bustle was famous around these parts. He recalled the last time he came here and was so excited he couldn\u2019t sleep for three nights. Why was it that a home grown kid who never saw the flourishing city didn\u2019t even flinch?Of course, how could he know? In Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes, this place was no different than a village.\u201cOld Pang, is Cai clan far from here?\u201d Sharing hardships brought them closer and even started calling each other brothers.Luo Yunchang spoke before Captain Pang could, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to go so quickly. I and Yunhai must make an official visit first, then I will come see you. Stay at a tavern in the meantime.\u201d\u201cSo annoying!\u201d frowned Zhuo Fan.With a bitter smile, Captain Pang just shrugged, \u201cCan\u2019t be helped. There\u2019s no one rushing us now. If we go there now, they will laugh at us for not showing propriety.\u201d\u201cFine, you go first.\u201d Zhuo Fan sighted, but nodded.As long as the siblings were safe and he gained his freedom, waiting for a bit more wouldn\u2019t hurt.After five days of silence, someone couldn\u2019t restrain their temper and began running his mouth.\u201cHumph, stinky slave. Windgaze City is my sister\u2019s domain. Just you wait, see how I\u2019ll deal with you.\u201d Luo Yunhai crossed his arms and flared his nostrils, becoming the same old impertinent young master from before.Bam!He didn\u2019t get to enjoy it though, as Zhuo Fan delivered a healthy kick to his rear. He flew a meter and landed on his face.\u201cNo need to wait, let\u2019s settle this now.\u201dLuo Yunchang rushed to help her brother and glared at Zhuo Fan, \u201cWhy do you always pick on a child?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s your brother who needs a spanking.\u201dZhuo Fan shot her a look then waved, \u201cGo already. After you settle in, if you still look at me with such discontent, I will not hesitate to leave you.\u201dLuo Yunchang snorted and left while hugging her brother.Luo Yunhai rested his head on her shoulder, face red as if choking but not daring to make a peep.Even a child like him understood the two siblings had no power in the forest and suffered at the hands of that despicable and dastardly servant. But now that they were in Windgaze City, his sister\u2019s turf, it didn\u2019t seem to make much difference. [Why am I getting beaten by that damn slave again?][Does this slave fear not even Heaven and Earth?] Luo Yunhai never saw anyone like him in the Luo clan.Captain Pang watched this unfold with shock to say the least, as his eyes were close to popping.Not even he knew Zhuo Fan was so daring and impertinent that he\u2019d beat up the young master right in front of young miss. Yet she did not make a complaint nor retaliate.Young miss dotted on her brother, never once being harsh with him. Yet Zhuo Fan trampled over young master with no regard to her with uncanny ease and skill.Now he understood why young master looked at Zhuo Fan like a mouse eyeing a cat.Wiping the sweat off his forehead, Captain Pang said, \u201cBrother Zhuo Fan, young master is your lord. If not out of respect for the young miss, do it out of respect for her husband. How could you kick him?\u201dZhuo Fan laughed then shrugged. No one was a lord in his eyes. Everything he did was to remove the heart demon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Let\u2019s stroll around the city.\u201dZhuo Fan turned around and walked away. Captain Pang knew he didn\u2019t take his words to heart and sigh as he followed.They were soon in the market area. This was where rogue cultivators sold their wares, to exchange items or other cultivating materials.With Zhuo Fan\u2019s experience, he should be able to find goods which others overlooked.The two visited many stalls, and many times, Captain Pang wanted to put his hands in his pocket, but when he saw Zhuo Fan walking away with a dull look, he followed suit.Perhaps he wasn\u2019t aware, but the grand captain of the guard was reduced to following Zhuo Fan at every step.\u201cAi, since when did the world overflow with overlooked treasures? Let\u2019s just go.\u201d Zhuo Fan scoured the market but nothing caught his eye.It was then he heard a ruckus.He went to see a stall owner and a red-faced girl in a heated dispute.He led Captain Pang through the crowd\u2019s center and saw the girl\u2019s appearance. She wore white clothes, with fine eyebrows like a crescent moon and looked calmed and gentle. Even when yelled at, she never lost her smile as if she never got angry. She persevered despite opposition.\u201cThis black jade is fake.\u201d\u201cHow is it fake? This is the purest black jade, one that if left in the sun for a day, will still feel cool to the touch. If worn as a pendant, cultivation will be much easier\u2026\u201dThe man spat non-stop about how pure it was, \u201cYoung miss, do you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201dShe shook her head, but her smile never faltered, \u201cI do not know much about black jade, but I have seen one so I can tell this one\u2019s a fake.\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, you saw it once and dare to say you find this one fake? Did you hear, everyone? Has there ever been such an absurd situation in the world?\u201d\u201cIt has, and I know I\u2019m right. If we talk about price, the worst black jade is worth 10 spirit stones while the best a hundred. Yet yours is only 3 spirit stones.\u201d\u201cGet out of here! Enough with your rubbish, little girl. Don\u2019t ruin my business. How could you possibly know of its value?\u201dThe girl smiled while staring at the man. He felt a rage burning inside, but had nowhere to vent.As the saying goes, you can\u2019t strike one who only smiled.The girl kept denying the black jade\u2019s price without a solid reason. If it was any other person, he would\u2019ve slapped them silly. But her smile left him powerless to even lift his hand.\u201cThat black jade is indeed fake.\u201dA man\u2019s voice echoed out and the crowd saw Zhuo Fan watching the girl with a smile, \u201cYoung miss\u2019 eyes are true, but cannot explain where the fault lies. As everyone knows, reality is a matter of perception. What\u2019s real can be fake and what\u2019s fake can be real..\u201dThe girl was taken aback but nodded while scrutinizing him.Zhuo Fan turned to the crowd, \u201cEveryone, is it possible to prepare a few things? Sulfur, clover\u2026\u201dHe enumerated some of the most common things, and some people already bought them.Under everyone\u2019s eyes, Zhuo Fan threw them in water, stirred, and said to the stall owner, \u201cPlease place the black jade inside.\u201d\u201cHumph, you\u2019re just washing it!\u201d He was also confident, even as he placed it inside.But once it entered, the water began to bubble and turn red. It even released a faint hint of blood energy.\u201cHow can it be?\u201d The stall owner was shocked.The girl also watched wide-eyed, astonished.\u201cHa-ha-ha, no need to be so surprised. This black jade was just an imitation that will show its real color once introduced to water.\u201d Zhuo Fan took the black jade and gave it to the owner, \u201cNow you should know this lady was right.\u201d\u201cThat bastard lied to me! He sold it to me for 20 spirit stones.\u201d The stall owner gnashed his teeth.\u201cThis black jade is only worth 3 spirit stones.\u201dThe girl declared her assessment then smiled to Zhuo Fan, \u201cMister has good eyes. I knew it was fake, but couldn\u2019t pinpoint the difference. I thank mister for his intervention.\u201d\u201cIt was nothing. I have also seen this once,\u201d Zhuo Fan smiled. \u201cYoung miss, won\u2019t you buy it? It\u2019s just 3 stones now.\u201d\u201cNo need. I only wanted to inform others of the stone\u2019s real price.\u201d She chuckled and left.Watching her figure fading into the crowd, Captain Pang sighed next to Zhuo Fan, \u201cWhat an odd girl.\u201dZhuo Fan, on the other hand, breathed out relieved as he muttered, \u201cThat girl\u2019s eyes are sharp and sinister. It\u2019s a good thing she is still inexperienced, or she would\u2019ve taken the treasure without hesitation.\u201dHe then turned to the black jade, eyes shining with excitement.But the stall owner was sighing as he packed his things, ready to go home\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He didn\u2019t talk, just sighed as he walked.But then a voice came from behind, \u201cOwner, please wait.\u201dHe stopped with a startle and looked to see Zhuo Fan walking over.\u201cYou\u2019re the one from before\u2026\u201d He recognized Zhuo Fan. It was him who showed everyone his black jade was fake.\u201cIs there something you need?\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, owner, I like your black jade and will pay ten spirit stones for it.\u201d Zhuo Fan laughed, taking glances at the man\u2019s bag.After some muttering, the owner looked oddly at Zhuo Fan, \u201cMister, you know this stone is fake, so why pay 10 spirit stones? The lady said it was worth 3.\u201dShaking his head, Zhuo Fan added, \u201cEven if it is fake, it can still pass off for the real thing. I might be able to sell it as a black jade.\u201d\u201cOh, I see. You want to trick others into buying it.\u201d The owner nodded in understanding then scanned around, \u201cSince this is the case, things are different now, it is worth much more than just 10 spirit stones.\u201d\u201cHow much do you want then?\u201d Zhuo Fan squinted with murderous intent.\u201cAt least 50!\u201d The owner showed his own sneaky side, \u201cIf not, I\u2019ll just find my own target and sell it at a hundred.\u201dThanks to Zhuo Fan\u2019s reminder, the owner realized how rare were people who could tell the real black jade from fake. He could sell the fake himself and earn a fortune.\u201cAre you buying, or do I have to look elsewhere?\u201dSeeing Zhuo Fan\u2019s expression, the owner knew he didn\u2019t have that many spirit stones on him. But it was fine since he could sell it himself and dupe another in the process. He walked away.\u201cWait!\u201dThe moment he took the first step, a hand grabbed his shoulder like an iron claw, eliciting a shout of pain from the owner.\u201cOwner, don\u2019t be too greedy.\u201d Zhuo Fan warned.\u201cHumph, so what if I am? The black jade is mine and I\u2019ll sell it at whatever price I want\u2026\u201dHis voice choked as a black Yuan Qi entered his body.After his body turned black, a breeze scattered his dust into the wind.Releasing his breath, Zhuo Fan felt his Yuan Qi grow a bit. He was a 1st layer Qi Condensation expert. The 7th layer Foundation Establishment owner hardly helped in increasing his power.He just wanted to trade, but the owner had to be ruthless and force his hand.Zhuo Fan took the black jade and returned to the tavern.He wasn\u2019t addicted to killing, but some people were addicted to courting death.Zhuo Fan met with Captain Pang at the tavern and threw him a pouch, \u201cOld Pang, here.\u201dCaptain Pang didn\u2019t understand, \u201cEh? The 10 spirit stones are all here? Didn\u2019t you buy it?\u201dZhuo Fan left Captain Pang at the tavern after borrowing 10 spirit stones, saying he found something that caught his eye. Yet the same spirit stones were left in the bag, untouched.\u201cOh, that old man was so nice he just gave it to me.\u201d Zhuo Fan dodged.\u201cAlso, Old Pang, guard my door and don\u2019t let anyone come in.\u201dWith that, he closed the door to his room. Captain Pang found it strange, but since they were like brothers now, he helped him out. As such, he sat before Zhuo Fan\u2019s door as a guard.Zhuo Fan was clear as to what happened beyond his door and nodded, pleased. He lucked out in finding such a loyal man.Next, he settled the black jade on the table and released his dark Yuan Qi.Bam!The stone\u2019s exterior cracked and fell, revealing a blood-red light.It was no longer a black jade but a bloody one. Moreover, it gave the impression of a heart as it flashed on and off like heartbeats.\u201cI knew it, it\u2019s the Blood Spirit!\u201dZhuo Fan swallowed, his face working hard to restrain the obvious delight in his voice.The Blood Spirit stems from any stone. It\u2019s only requirement of formation is to be bathed in the blood of millions of people, absorbing the essence of sun and moon for thousands of years, it would take form. It was a demonic cultivator treasure, rarest of treasures.A cultivator would use the Blood Spirit to form a Blood Infant. In battle, he could send the Blood Infant to absorb the opponent\u2019s blood essence then kill him. And the Blood Infant could grow along with the cultivator. Once Zhuo Fan grew strong enough, even an Emperor wouldn\u2019t dare mess with it.According to the Nine Serenities Secret Records, there was once an ancient demonic cultivator expert, Patriarch Blood Demon, that trained the Blood Infant to the Saint Stage. Even the ancient ten Emperors were unwilling to make an enemy out of him.Patriarch Blood Demon felt invincible and went to challenge Nine Serenities Emperor for the title of the strongest demonic cultivator. It was a drawn out battle, with the Nine Serenities Emperor heavily wounded at the end; barely overcoming the Patriarch Blood Demon by half a move.However, the Nine Serenities Emperor obtained Patriarch Blood Demon\u2019s secret method to raise the Blood Infant, improved it, and added it to the Demon Transformation Art. The Nine Serenities Emperor wanted to train the Blood Infant too, but never got the chance.Never did he, Zhuo Fan, the Demonic Emperor, think he\u2019d have such a stroke of luck after rebirthing to train the Blood Infant.If he had it in his past life, a Saint would\u2019ve been nothing.That thought made him eager to slash his wrist and pour his blood onto the blood jade.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The stone started to throb and the sensation only grew stronger with each drop of blood.Zhuo Fan smiled viciously and pushed out more blood for the jade.If he wanted to refine the Blood Infant, he needed to bathe it in his blood until the Blood Spirit synchronized both their breathing and heartbeat.The seconds trickled by as Zhuo Fan\u2019s blood thinned, but the Blood Spirit was never sated, devouring everything he gave.Zhuo Fan licked his dried lips, growing paler as his mind was clouded. He knew the loss of blood was too great, but he\u2019d come too far now.There was only one chance to refine the Blood Infant. If he stopped, it\u2019d be like throwing a child away. It would think Zhuo Fan abandoned it and would never approve of him ever again.This was why there was no going back once Zhuo Fan started the process.After an hour, Zhuo Fan felt the world spinning. If he dared keep this up, it would endanger his life. If his life came at an end, the Blood Spirit would lose its meaning.Just as he was considering abandoning the process, an indescribable feeling arose in his heart.Zhuo Fan was stunned, then overjoyed. His mind and the Blood Spirit were now connected.He held onto the bloodstone and activated the Demon Transformation Art. Black Yuan Qi enveloped the stone and strands of blood left it to enter Zhuo Fan.Finally, the bloodstone shattered with a loud sound and a red glow shot for his body. Zhuo Fan checked in glee and saw the red palm-sized infant resting in his Dantian.Sensing his eyes, the infant opened his eyes then went to sleep.\u201cT-this is the Blood Infant!\u201dAfter a moment of stupefaction, he jumped in joy. He never thought it would be so easy to refine the Blood Infant.Even though he succeeded, he lost too much blood. When he stood up, his legs went soft and hit the ground. But even that couldn\u2019t wipe the grin off his face.\u201cNow that I have the Blood Infant, the next step is to settle on a martial art to learn.\u201dBlood Palm, a mid mortal ranked martial art. The palm would rain havoc to one\u2019s blood and reverse its flow. Thanks to also having the Blood Infant, it was now savage enough to even damage one\u2019s blood essence.Despite a mere mid mortal ranked, its power was as strong as a high mortal ranked martial art. It might even surpass it\u2026Ten days later.The door opened with a creak and Zhuo Fan came out grinning. Captain Pang rose to his feet and rubbed his eyes.\u201cWhy did you take so long? Cai Manor already sent someone over.\u201dSeeing the dead tired Old Pang, Zhuo Fan smiled, \u201cOld Pang, thank you for your hard work.\u201d\u201cAi, what hard work between brothers? But we cannot let young miss and young master wait for too long.\u201d\u201cHmm, you\u2019re not curious what I\u2019ve been doing the past ten days?\u201d\u201cThat is your business. You\u2019ll tell me when you want to.\u201d Captain Pang waved indifferently, pulling Zhuo Fan with haste towards Cai Manor.Zhuo Fan was touched seeing this rough man. Despite not knowing each other for long, Old Pang had complete trust in him.This never happened for all his life as Demonic Emperor.They arrived an hour later before a majestic gate with a sign inscribed in golden letters, Cai Manor.Just when they were about to enter, the guards stopped them.\u201cStop. Who are you to dare enter Cai Manor?\u201dCaptain Pang clasped his hand, \u201cHa-ha-ha, I am Luo clan\u2019s captain of the guard, Pang Yu, and this is Luo clan\u2019s steward, Zhuo Fan. My young miss and young master are guests in your home.\u201dZhuo Fan was taken aback. Since when did he become the Luo clan\u2019s steward?Pang Yu knew what he was thinking and whispered, \u201cEight days ago, Cai clan\u2019s men came to say you are Luo clan\u2019s steward. Young miss must have done it. Congratulations, brother Zhuo, he-he-he\u2026\u201dShaking his head out of helplessness, Zhuo Fan let out a bitter smile.He didn\u2019t want to be some steward, but to entrust the safety of the siblings to the Cai clan and free himself of the heart demon. How could the grand Demonic Emperor be a puny clan\u2019s steward?But just as how he looked down on the Luo clan, so did the guards of the Cai Manor.The two guards shot a glance filled with contempt, \u201cHumph, another two showed up to cheat their way to a free meal.\u201d\u201cHey, what did you say?\u201dCaptain Pang was pissed and wanted to argue, but Zhuo Fan stopped him. They walked inside.Captain Pang didn\u2019t understand, \u201cWhy did you stop me?\u201dZhuo Fan only had a grave expression. These two server\u2019s attitude was a reflection of their lords. Nothing good would come out of talking to them. The two needed to find Luo Yunchang and understand what was happening. The Cai Manor might not be such a good place to place his trust in.After some inquiry, they arrived at the siblings\u2019 dwelling.Seeing the wretched place they lived in, even lower than the tavern rooms, Captain Pang cursed, \u201cWhy is the Cai clan treating young miss and young master like this? They are even less than guests.\u201d\u201cNot just that, they don\u2019t even consider them humans.\u201d Zhuo Fan felt anger seething inside. If not because of the siblings\u2019 injustice, then because of wasting his time and energy.\u201cLet\u2019s go in.\u201dZhuo Fan rushed next to Captain Pang who was in a hurry to open the door. Inside, they saw Luo Yunhai sitting on the bed crestfallen, without his usual enthusiasm.The place was crude, with just a broken chair and a broken table.Captain Pang\u2019s eyes teared up, \u201cYoung master, don\u2019t be sad\u2026\u201d\u201cKid, where\u2019s your sister?\u201d Zhuo Fan was blunt, with no sympathy.It seemed Zhuo Fan\u2019s beating casted a shadow on his heart. The lifeless Luo Yunhai shivered and woke up.Luo Yunhai stammered at the raging Zhuo Fan, \u201cSister went to look for him\u2026 hic, young master Cai, to help rebuild the Cloud Manor.\u201d\u201cAsking for help in this situation is asking for humiliation. Let\u2019s go look for your sister.\u201d Zhuo Fan dragged Luo Yunhai off the bed, his attitude worse than ever.Captain Pang was in a panic, wanting to stop Zhuo Fan from being so rude to his master. But Zhuo Fan\u2019s mood seemed to put him off, and all the courage left him.As such, Luo Yunhai was shaking in fear as he led them.Captain Pang cached up to them, thinking.

From now on, I have nothing more to do with you. My eyes are only for Yufei.\u201d\u201cYeah, now get lost. Brother Xiaoting doesn\u2019t love you anymore.\u201d The lady in red sneered at her.Biting her lip, Luo Yunchang\u2019s eyes mist over.At the time when Luo and Cai clans were on good terms, the parents of both families arranged their marriage. She and Cai Xiaoting grew up together and swore their love for each other, to never abandon the other.This was why the first person she thought of was her fianc\u00e9e when she needed help.Yet reality was cruel. Ever since they came here, she and her brother kept suffering while Cai Xiaoting had the arrogant and insufferable Sun clan\u2019s young miss, Sun Yufei, next to him.She knew all hope of marrying into the Cai clan was lost. But for the sake of rebuilding her clan, she hoped to stir Clan Head Cai\u2019s amiable emotions the two clans had in the past and lend a helping hand.Yet Clan Head Cai Rong was cold and unfeeling to their plight, not moving an inch.The siblings stayed here for ten days, all in hope of gaining some assistance. But since Cai Rong ignored her, she could only turn to Cai Xiaoting.\u201cBrother Xiaoting, I don\u2019t ask for you to go through with the engagement, and only hope you can persuade your father, for old time sake, and help the Luo clan. \u201d\u201cIt has nothing to do with me. Talk with dad.\u201d Cai Xiaoting waved his sleeve coldly.Luo Yunchang kneeled with tears streaming down her cheeks.\u201cBrother Xiaoting, if you don\u2019t agree, I will kneel here until I die.\u201dTaking a long look at her, Cai Xiaoting frowned and was plagued by hesitation.But then Sun Yufei jumped between them and slapped Luo Yunchang. The blow threw her back and blood trickled from her mouth.\u201cHumph, bitch, Cai Xiaoting is mine. Stay away from him.\u201dSun Yufei\u2019s phoenix eyes glared and raved. She turned to Cai Xiaoting and said harshly, \u201cYou stay away from her too. If I find there\u2019s still something left between you, I will leave you.\u201dAs if waking up, he nodded and swore, \u201cYufei, relax, my heart is yours. Other girls are dirt compared to you.\u201dCai Xiaoting\u2019s eyes showed his sincere feelings, watching her like a love-struck puppy.Sun Yufei nodded pleased, as Luo Yunchang\u2019s face turned ashen. She knew her last hope faded away\u2026Whoosh!A shadow flashed by and two slaps echoed. Sun Yufei and Cai Xiaoting were still confused about what happened, when a red handprint appeared on their faces.Zhuo Fan stood in front of Luo Yunchang as he stared at them, \u201cA damn illicit couple dares to ruin my affairs?\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201dSun Yufei and Cai Xiaoting woke up with a start. They were geniuses of Windgaze City, Qi Condensation experts, and peerless in their generation.Yet here was Zhuo Fan, of similar age yet faster than even them. They got slapped before they could react.Is it possible for such an individual to exist in this world?As the scene played out, only Captain Pang and Luo Yunhai came to Luo Yunchang\u2019s help.Seeing the thin figure in front, Captain Pang was even more shocked.Although he was an expert in the 4th layer of Qi Condensation, while Cai Xiaoting was in the 3rd, a level beneath him; They had different upbringings and if they clashed, he might even lose.Yet such arrogant geniuses were slapped by Zhuo Fan. Thinking about the power he displayed in the forest, Captain Pang couldn\u2019t help but wonder how he got so strong in such a short span of time.Ignoring the two and the shocked Captain Pang, Zhuo Fan turned to the crying and pitiful Luo Yunchang and felt pain in his heart.\u201cWretched heart demon.\u201d Zhuo Fan gnashed his teeth.With his Demonic Emperor disposition, he could look beyond the world\u2019s entire sufferings. How could a girl\u2019s humiliation ever cause him pain? He could only attribute it to this body\u2019s former soul, who felt anger for his master.\u201cAi, it looks like I\u2019ll be stuck with the Luo clan for some time.\u201dZhuo Fan sighed inside as he wiped Luo Yunchang\u2019s tears, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dLuo Yunchang nodded, there was no point in staying here. She carried the bitter Luo Yunhai and walked with Captain Pang\u2019s help.\u201cHumph, don\u2019t think you can run after hitting us.\u201dSun Yufei shrieked as she barred their way. Cai Xiaoting chimed in, \u201cLuo Yunchang, you think this is a place you can come and go as you please?\u201dLuo Yunchang was filled with grief and balled her fists. She regretted ever coming here for help. Facing this overbearing couple in their home, she could only reign in her anger.If she were alone, she would\u2019ve rather fight them for her honor, but she still had her brother. If he died, she would be too ashamed to meet her parents in the Underworld River.\u201cW-what do you want?\u201d Luo Yunchang\u2019s voice trembled.\u201cHumph, simple. Kneel and kowtow three times.\u201d Sun Yufei smiled viciously and pointed at Zhuo Fan, \u201cEspecially him!\u201dClenching his teeth, Captain Pang\u2019s eyes went red, wanting nothing more than to beat them senseless. This was too humiliating.Luo Yunchang hesitated, then closed her eyes as her knees bent.\u201cKneel, all of you.\u201dThey could all hear her faint mournful voice. Sun Yufei stuck out her chin with arrogance and smiled with pride.Bam!Before they kneeled, Sun Yufei and Cai Xiaoting took the initiative to kneel first with a cry. Rather saying they kneeled, it was better to say their knees were focible smacked onto the pavement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If they weren\u2019t Qi Condensation experts, their knees would be crushed, unable to walk again.The two grimaced as they looked up to see Zhuo Fan standing before them.\u201cYou again!\u201dThe couple knew Zhuo Fan was the only one among the group who had the power to attack them out of the blue.\u201cEven if you beg on your knees now, I won\u2019t ever let you go.\u201d Sun Yufei glared scornfully at Zhuo Fan, howling with rage.Pa, pa!Two hits echoed and Zhuo Fan kicked them without hesitation.\u201cYou want me to kneel? You think too highly of yourselves.\u201dSun Yufei and Cai Xiaoting were dumbfounded, even forgetting the pain from the kick.Slapping them to help Luo Yunchang out of a predicament, was something they could understand. To make amends, they were ordered to kneel. Yet, the steward still had the guts to strike them. Was he not afraid they would never be allowed to leave Cai Manor alive?Captain Pang was enraged by the two\u2019s act, but he looked at it from a different perspective and felt it was better to endure, or the Luo clan would be perishing here.Luo Yunchang smiled dejectedly. Others didn\u2019t understand Zhuo Fan, while she gained first-hand knowledge of his violent character in the forest. He never once acted like a servant. He just did whatever he wanted. She just could not cope with the fact their Luo clan had such a servant.Yet, Luo Yunhai\u2019s attitude changed completely. He now looked at Zhuo Fan with worship and adoration.This damnable slave\u2019s nerve that always bullied him wasn\u2019t limited to picking on his masters, but even on others. He just didn\u2019t know fear. In that instant, the image of the damnable slave turned into an almighty hero coming to rescue the Luo clan.\u201cWho dares to act impertinently in the Cai clan\u2019s domain?\u201dA man\u2019s rebuke echoed as he appeared before them.Luo Yunchang\u2019s face dropped. She pulled her brother so close that even he could feel her anxiety.Cai Xiaoting was overjoyed, \u201cDad, you\u2019re here! He is looking for trouble with our Cai clan.\u201dKnowing Clan Head Cai Rong came, Zhuo Fan eyed him more carefully.Cai Rong looked to be in his fifty, tall and sturdy, and a powerful aura emanating from him.\u201c8th layer of Bone Tempering.\u201d Smiled Zhuo Fan.Cai Rong\u2019s eyebrows jumped as shock flashed over his face. He never thought possible for a youth to see through his cultivation.\u201cGood eyes!\u201d Patronized Cai Rong, \u201cMay I ask who you are?\u201d\u201cLuo clan\u2019s steward, Zhuo Fan!\u201dCai Rong was startled and observed him closely.He heard from Luo Yunchang that Luo clan had a new steward, since the old one turned traitor, but he didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be one as young as Zhuo Fan. And he also gave off a strange energy.If it were any other time, a fox like him would never mess with an unknown variable like Zhuo Fan. Such a pity there was now a power in this city he could offend even less.\u201cUncle Cai, you must bring justice to us victims.\u201d Sun Yufei revealed the red print on her face while glaring at Zhuo Fan.Cai Rong understood the situation in an instant. He placate her, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, uncle Cai is here now.\u201dHe then turned solemn as he looked at Luo Yunchang, \u201cYunchang, I took you, siblings, out of kindness. It is fine if you do not reciprocate, but why look for trouble?\u201dLuo Yunchang shuddered, lost for words.Zhuo Fan stepped forward with a smile, \u201cYou even bully a lady at your age, Clan Head Cai. I needn\u2019t say anything more. Moreover, stop preaching kindness. No need to mince words, you did it out of benefit, or you wouldn\u2019t have annulled the marriage. \u201d\u201cAlright, since you want us to be hostile, I won\u2019t be lenient.\u201d Cai Rong\u2019s face changed, \u201cToday, I will have to settle this for Yufei. You need only handle my palm attack. I won\u2019t take advantage of you and only use two tenths. Let life and death be decided like this.\u201dTwo tenths?As his pupils shrunk, Captain Pang shouted, \u201cComing from you, it\u2019s even stronger than a 9th layer Qi Condensation expert\u2019s all-out attack. You clearly want us dead!\u201d\u201cUncle Cai, I beg you. Yunhai is still a child, he is innocent!\u201d Yunchang implored.But Cai Rong snorted, then smiled at Sun Yufei.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go first.\u201d Zhuo Fan\u2019s mouth perked up.Whoosh!A great red palm appeared in the air. Cai Rong didn\u2019t expect for Zhuo Fan to attack first and turned serious as he sent his own palm attack.At contact, the blood palm scattered and Zhuo Fan fell back ten steps, yet was unharmed.\u201cA 2nd layer Qi Condensation can withstand two tenths of my power!?\u201d Cai Rong\u2019s heart was in shock, \u201cBut your survival all came down to luck.\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, the only reason I\u2019m still alive is because I don\u2019t believe in luck.\u201d And he pointed at Cai Rong\u2019s hand with a grin, \u201cBut power.\u201dCai Rong\u2019s eyes squinted. His hand was bleeding from the previous exchange.How could this be? [He is just a 2nd layer Qi Condensation cultivator while I am an 8th layer Bone Tempering cultivator. That\u2019s a whole stage difference!]\u201cFurthermore,\u201d followed Zhuo Fan, \u201cYou really think that was two tenths? That wasn\u2019t even a tenth.\u201dCai Rong began to recall what transpired.Despite the abruptness of it all, he indeed wanted to release two tenths, but when he released the palm, his blood fell in disorder and the result was obvious to all.\u201cAlso, take a look at your son.\u201dZhuo Fan pointed at Cai Xiaoting. Cai Rong saw his son spat a mouthful of blood.\u201cDad, w-what\u2019s happening?\u201d Cai Xiaoting panicked. He wasn\u2019t wounded yet he puked blood.\u201cZhuo Fan, what the hell did you do?\u201d Cai Rong roared.Zhuo Fan replied with a sneer, \u201cI only wanted to tell Clan Head Cai I can take your son\u2019s life anytime. Please take it into consideration.\u201dAs Cai Rong was hesitating, Zhuo Fan pointed again, eliciting another mouth of blood form Cai Xiaoting.\u201cAlright, I believe you.\u201d Cai Rong wiped his brow of sweat as he spoke in a shaky voice.He didn\u2019t know what trick he pulled on his son, but Zhuo Fan was prepared for his intervention. He was now regretting. If he knew the Luo clan had such a shrewd and decisive steward, he wouldn\u2019t have taken things this far.\u201cThen, I will bid you farewell here. Clan Head Cai.\u201d Zhuo Fan sneered as he cupped his hands then pulled Luo Yunchang and walked away.Zhuo Fan laughed all the while, \u201cToday you love to bully me, tomorrow you\u2019ll be beneath me.\u201d\u201cUncle Cai, are you letting him go?\u201d Sun Yufei said with resentment.Sighing helplessly, Cai Rong muttered as he watched Zhuo Fan leave, \u201cInstead of offering shelter, I invited an enemy\u2026\u201dShaking his head, he helped Cai Xiaoting walk inside. After a few steps, his eyes flashed as he turned to Sun Yufei.\u201cYufei, we need to end Zhuo Fan as soon as possible. He will endanger your Sun clan.\u201d\u201cHumph. you don\u2019t dare to attack him because of your son. My Sun clan isn\u2019t afraid. I will let him have a taste of what it means to offend the Seven Noble Houses!\u201d Sun Yufei spoke with hatred.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17 - Veiled Dragon PavilionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs the three left Cai Manor, Captain Pang and Luo Yunchang were trembling and even looked back now and then for fear of Cai Rong having changed his mind. Only Zhuo Fan was calm, yet a bit of rage still existed in his heart.\u201cYoung miss, is there anywhere else we can go?\u201d Zhuo Fan asked in a cold tone.Her eyes turned misty as she shook her head. Captain Pang also signed in sorrow.Taking a deep breath, Zhuo Fan gnashed his teeth and promised himself to run the Cai clan into the ground one day.He was just a step away from providing a safe haven for the Luo siblings, yet Cai clan\u2019s father and son ruined it all.If the day came that the Cai clan was ruined because they offended Zhuo Fan, Cai Rong would be twisting inside with regret.But that was the future. Now, Zhuo Fan was pissed. His hopes were dashed and he had to spend more time to look after the siblings.Zhuo Fan mumbled for a while, then said, \u201cYoung miss, do you know what are the Seven Noble Houses?\u201d\u201cWhat! W-where did you hear that from?\u201dLuo Yunchang was in a panic as she watched Zhuo Fan. It was as if he knew a heavenly secret. But recalling the fantastic events that happened the past days, she relaxed.Captain Pang also looked oddly at Luo Yunchang. This was the first time he heard of them.Pursing her lips for a long time, Luo Yunchang finally spoke in a solemn tone, \u201cSince we lived in Cloud Manor and had no dealings with them, not knowing them is normal. But we are now wondering outside. If you ever meet someone from the Seven Noble Houses, you must avoid him, even if it\u2019s a dog.\u201dCaptain Pang was shocked. This was his first time seeing Luo Yunchang speaking on such a heavy tone; as if she was talking about horrifying people. Yet, a proud girl like her, even if from a fallen clan, did not speak near as highly about the Cai clan.The warning seemed to go right past Zhuo Fan as he retained his calm.\u201cBe it Luo clan or Cai clan, regardless of how strong they are, they are only mortal clans. But in Tianyu Empire, there are seven officials who earned the imperial family\u2019s approval and can stand next to the Emperor. Their power and territory are above all mortal clans. Fighting them is like going against the Empire.\u201d\u201cWhat? This world has clans that can stand next to the imperial family?\u201d Captain Pang\u2019s face contorted in fear.Luo Yunchang nodded with extreme seriousness, \u201cEvery clan knows these seven families must not be touched. I am telling you this so that you all must remember to be careful!\u201d\u201cIs the Sun clan one of them?\u201d interrupted Zhuo Fan.Stunned for a second, Luo Yunchang shook her head, \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d\u201cYeah, brother Zhuo, if she was of the seven houses, then young miss would\u2019ve stopped you from smacking her. \u201d Captain Pang snickered. Since Luo Yunchang didn\u2019t stop him then she agreed in silence.As if she was found out, Luo Yunchang reddened and glared at him.In fact, seeing Sun Yufei slapped was the most refreshing event for Luo Yunchang. Since Captain Pang could tell how glad the girl was, how could Zhuo Fan not? But Zhuo Fan\u2019s vision was much further. Even if they had a falling out with the Sun clan, he had to understand the other\u2019s background.\u201cThen is the Sun clan part of the seven houses?\u201d\u201cWhat made you come to that conclusion?\u201d Luo Yunchang was feeling nervous for some reason.Her only hope right now was that Zhuo Fan was joking around to scare her, but his next words were spoken with a straight face, \u201cThat girl raved how she\u2019ll let us see the might of the Seven Noble Houses.\u201d\u201cH-how can this be? Did we offend Seven Noble Houses\u2019 people?\u201dLuo Yunchang paled and her mind blanked, watching Zhuo Fan with empty eyes. Captain Pang was even worse, his heart froze up.At this moment, the world seemed to have vanished, making way for silence\u2026\u201cZhuo Fan, quick, we need to apologize to young miss Sun.\u201dLuo Yunchang pulled him to Cai Manor, but Zhuo Fan was stuck like a rock.\u201cIf we go, we\u2019ll die.\u201d Zhuo Fan said coldly.Luo Yunchang froze and her eyes glazed with helplessness. Zhuo Fan\u2019s words were ear-piercing but they all spoke of the harsh truth. If offending the Seven Noble Houses was so easily settled, no one would\u2019ve regarded them with such fear.\u201cBrother Zhuo, what do we do?\u201dThey were all surprised to find Luo Yunhai speaking as he gazed at Zhuo Fan with unshakable faith.Not even Zhuo Fan foresaw it. A kid that everyone overlooked was now watching him with such big and innocent eyes.\u201cWasn\u2019t I a stinkin\u2019 slave?\u201d squinted Zhuo Fan.\u201cBig bro Zhuo, we, brother and sister, are grateful for this new chance at life. You\u2019re our greatest benefactor, my dear brother. My dear brother-in-law, please save us once again.\u201d\u201cYunhai, don\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201d Luo Yunhai glared with a red face, yet her eyes couldn\u2019t help sneaking a glance at Zhuo Fan.They were alive thanks to him. Despite being inferior in his eyes, Zhuo Fan\u2019s abilities made others have a whole new level of respect for him. This was the reason why she appointed him as the clan\u2019s steward.For the rebuilding of the clan, men like him were needed.Zhuo Fan saw Luo Yunhai\u2019s imploring eyes and laughed inside.[This kid is a clan\u2019s son after all, haughty but also clever to see another\u2019s talent; how adorable.] Moreover, helping the Luo clan was a given for him, \u201cDoes Windgaze City have men from the seven houses?\u201d\u201cYes, the Veiled Dragon Pavilion, the number one treasure appraising clan among the seven houses. Its wealth knows no bounds.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s return to the tavern and go to Veiled Dragon Pavilion tomorrow.\u201d Zhuo Fan ruffled Luo Yunhai\u2019s head.\u201cWhat for?\u201d Luo Yunchang rushed to ask.\u201cAllies!\u201d Zhuo Fan\u2019s curt reply came.The others were stunned.Why would one of the Seven Noble Houses, the Veiled Dragon Pavilion, ally with a run down clan? That was more of the wish of a hopeless loser\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s size overwhelmed any from approaching to the point that not a single person dared get within a hundred meters of it.Two guards in golden garb stood at the gates. Their aura gave off the impression of veterans, of imperial bodyguards.Despite standing still, their eyes roamed everywhere, staring daggers at any who dared match their gaze.But in this place, four people suddenly appeared.\u201cPeak of Qi Condensation!\u201dZhuo Fan muttered as he walked in front of the siblings and Captain Pang. While he had no problem facing such imposing guards, the three stiffened, to the point they almost forgot to walk.\u201cStop!\u201dThe guards barred Zhuo Fan\u2019s path, \u201cVeiled Dragon Pavilion is not a place for you to wonder about!\u201d\u201cI ask that you send word of Cloud Manor Luo clan\u2019s young miss, Luo Yunchang, I have arrived to have something appraised.\u201d Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t even look at them.The two exchanged a look of surprise.Windgaze City didn\u2019t lack people who came here to see the appraiser, but all were fearful and fawned them when talking. This was a first though, meeting such a smug kid.\u201cWe\u2019ve never heard of you. Our appraiser can\u2019t meet with nobodies!\u201d spoke a guard harshly.Luo Yunchang lowered her head. One of the Seven Noble Houses, Veiled Dragon Pavilion, would never pay attention to an ant-like clan. They weren\u2019t even worthy to speak with them, not to mention become allies.\u201cZhuo Fan\u2026\u201dLuo Yunchang pulled Zhuo Fan, but before she could finish, he shook her off, \u201cThat is the appraiser\u2019s concern to see us. Try and act as the servants you are.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d The guards were outraged, releasing their full aura.The Luo clan members felt their breathing become heavier as they retreated back. Only Zhuo Fan stood in his place and roared, \u201cIs this how the Seven Noble Houses treats its guests? Humph, truly renowned.\u201d\u201cStop.\u201dA girl in white came out to meet them. The guards bowed, \u201cYoung miss, these people are looking for trouble.\u201d\u201cI heard what you said, and it is you who are in the wrong. All who come are guests. Make sure to show respect.\u201d The girl berated them in a cold tone, then smiled at Zhuo Fan, \u201cMister, we meet again.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s you?\u201dZhuo Fan and Captain Pang were startled. She was the one that quarreled with the stall owner.But things were different now.Zhuo Fan sneered inside, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect for young miss to be from the Veiled Dragon Pavilion. Please forgive my lack of respect.\u201dThe girl nodded with a smile, \u201cI am Long Kui, only a small appraiser here. I wonder why mister has come to us?\u201d\u201cTo be honest, I am Luo clan\u2019s steward, Zhuo Fan. Because a terrible misfortune plagues us, I accompanied my young miss to the Veiled Dragon Pavilion, the number one appraising noble house in Tianyu Empire\u2019s number one appraising noble house, to sell the clan\u2019s treasure.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d Eyes flashing, Long Kui smiled when she saw Luo Yunchang nodding, then turned back to Zhuo Fan, \u201cThen I will do my best to examine your treasure. Please, follow me.\u201dShe showed them in, to the shock of the guards, \u201cWas that\u2026 young miss\u2019 friend?\u201d\u201cNo way. How can young miss have such a dirt poor friend? She must be doing it for the treasure. Once it fails to meet her expectations, they will be kicked out. Then, he-he-he\u2026\u201d\u201cWe will teach them a lesson they won\u2019t ever forget, especially that rude Zhuo Fan. But what if the item is to her licking\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Just look at them, how can these wretched people have anything that is worth more than black jade? Ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201dThe other also jeered, rubbing his hand in eagerness to vent all his energy\u2026On the other side, Long Kui took them to a flourishing room and smiled once they were seated, \u201cI wonder what treasure did you bring? Please take it out.\u201dZhuo Fan grinned.[This girl thinks herself above others, but is quite shrewd as well.] He was certain she knew exactly what went on at the entrance, but let the guards test them if they were worthy of her time.If they showed any sign of giving up, her current attitude would\u2019ve been unyielding.Despite how cunning she was, she was far too naive when up against the devilish Zhuo Fan.Whoosh!Zhuo Fan placed a scroll with countless images before her, which immediately caught her full attention.Taking it in her hands, Long Kui took careful and long looks at the contents.Luo Yunchang and Captain Pang were in a bit of a shock. This drawing was something Zhuo Fan made last night. When they saw it, they only had one thought. [What is this thing?]Yet from the looks of Long Kui\u2019s expression, it must be worth a fortune.\u201cMister Zhuo Fan, how much do you want?\u201d Long Kui placed the scroll back and watched Zhuo Fan with a hardened gaze.\u201cYoung miss Long is an appraiser and saw your skill in the market. Please be the first to state a price.\u201d Zhuo Fan chuckled.Biting her lip, Long Kui noticed from his eyes that this man was also knowledgeable. She couldn\u2019t swindle him, \u201cHow does twenty thousand spirit stones sound?\u201d\u201cWhat, twenty thousand?\u201dLuo Yunchang stood up in shock.If you\u2019d take Cloud Manor\u2019s wealth when it was at its peak, you\u2019d get fifty thousand. Yet Zhuo Fan messed around with a brush and came up with twenty?Captain Pang was dumbstruck.Long Kui couldn\u2019t restrain her disdain for the two.[Humph, I am a madam while you are a pack of stray cats.]But when she saw the silent yet smiling Zhuo Fan, she turned serious.[The true expert is this steward\u2026]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Give me the scroll.\u201d Zhuo Fan reached out but was in no rush to take it as he stared down at her.Tightening her grip on the drawing, Long Kui bit her lip and shouted, \u201cTake it as my loss, thirty thousand.\u201d\u201cYoung miss Long, still is not honest enough.\u201d Zhuo Fan shook his head in disappointment and leaned over to grab for the scroll.Long Kui curled backward, wanting to dodge Zhuo Fan\u2019s evil clutches.This drawing was indeed a 1st-grade array, and this wasn\u2019t the first time she saw one. Her original price was quite fair and began with twenty thousand because she knew she couldn\u2019t swindle the knowledgeable Zhuo Fan.But even so, with how many arrays were out there, she didn\u2019t know them all. The number one appraising noble house in the empire had many arrays in storage, yet this was a rare chance for her to encounter one that was unlike any she saw before.As such, even if she would lose out, she would do all she could to have this array.A pity that the relentless Zhuo Fan stood in her way, unwilling to back down even half a step. As such, she turned to the ignored young miss of the Luo clan, \u201cYoung miss Luo, this drawing is thirty thousand at most. Only the Veiled Dragon Pavilion has the wealth to buy such a drawing in the entire empire. You won\u2019t gain a better price elsewhere.\u201d\u201cUhm\u2026\u201d She hesitated and glanced at Zhuo Fan.Long Kui knew she had an escape and pushed her advantage to entice her, \u201cYoung miss Luo, you and the Veiled Dragon Pavilion are making a great transaction and will become our honored guest. Our doors will forever be open to you.\u201dHonored guest?Luo Yunchang mumbled, \u201cIsn\u2019t this gaining a supporter?\u201dHer heart was overtaken with joy and turned to Zhuo Fan, \u201cWhat if\u2026\u201d\u201cNot a word!\u201d Zhuo Fan roared and glared at her.This foolish woman was swayed in seconds. How could the Veiled Dragon Pavilion stick their heads out for some bullshit guests? To get the best of their power, to have their protection, they could only attain it through a trade of equals.\u201cYoung miss Long, I am Luo clan\u2019s steward, in charge of all matters concerning it. Please return the drawing.\u201d Zhuo Fan\u2019s smile was replaced by a cold stare.Luo Yunchang looked in a daze, first at him then at Luo Yunchang.Though his words rang true, since when did a steward\u2019s power superseded his lord\u2019s? How was he the steward?[By the look of things, the lady of Luo clan is unable to keep the steward in check.]Sighing, Long Kui was very reluctant in giving the scroll back, evident by her slow movement, \u201cSuch a pity, mister Zhuo Fan. Your request is too high and I can\u2019t fulfill it. But I am willing to guarantee on our Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s fame, that this 1st-grade array won\u2019t go beyond thirty thousand.\u201dWith the scroll in hand, Zhuo Fan rose from his seat and leaned closer to Long Kui, leaving her flabbergast.Before she could say anything, he said, \u201cSorry, it seems I thought too highly of the young miss. You truly don\u2019t understand. Does this place have any other appraiser?\u201d\u201cW-what, I do not understand?\u201dLong Kui\u2019s cheeks were tinted red as her heart swelled with anger.No item that passed her hands hadn\u2019t received a correct assessment. The fact she could point out the fake black jade, yet unable to explain why, was her talent. It was because of this that she rose to a top-rated appraiser.In short, she was an expert!Yet, here came Zhuo Fan mocking her talent, refuting her skill in appraising. It was worse than any physical attack, an insult to her dignity.\u201cMister Zhuo Fan, your eyes are not wrong, but it is best not to overreach.\u201d Long Kui showed a smile that went beyond just anger. All of them could hear the gnashing of her teeth.Yet Zhuo only smiled, \u201cIs there any other appraiser here?\u201dLong Kui glared, \u201cFine, just wait here.\u201dAnd she left. Luo Yunchang was worried about the anger Long Kui showed, \u201cDid we offend the Veiled Dragon Pavilion?\u201dZhuo Fan shook his head with an unusual smile.Moments later, Long Kui appeared again with steady steps. But this time, an old man was at her side.\u201cGodeye Long Jiu?\u201dLuo Yunchang shouted in shock and turned to Zhuo Fan, \u201cHe is the supervisor of the Veiled Dragon Pavilion in Windgaze City, the head appraiser, Godeye Long Jiu.\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s Luo clan\u2019s young miss.\u201dEven from a hundred steps, Long Jiu\u2019s voice resounded clearly in their ears, \u201cI\u2019ve met your father twenty years ago. He was full of mettle then. I didn\u2019t expect for your clan to sell their treasure.\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s heart shivered as his brows knitted.This man\u2019s power was a cut above Cai Rong\u2019s, to the point not even Zhuo Fan could see through him. It wasn\u2019t that his eyesight were poor, or the fact the old man hid his power. The difference between them was just too deep.[I see. So Veiled Dragon Pavilion has such an expert], thought Zhuo Fan.Soon, Long Jiu was supported by Long Kui and arrived before them. Luo Yunchang bowed, \u201cGrandpa Jiu.\u201d The others were quick to follow, yet Zhuo Fan just stood there.Long Jiu sized him up with his only hazy eye, \u201cAre you Luo clan\u2019s steward?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cAlright. Anyone\u2019s better than that old Sun.\u201d Long Jiu shot a meaningful glance at them, then sat down, \u201cI heard you doubt little Kui\u2019s skill.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zhuo Fan didn\u2019t mince words, eliciting a snort from her and a roll of the eye.\u201cHa-ha-ha, little Kui might be new in this line of business, but her eyes are true. She must be more or less right with her assessment. But since you doubt her, this blind old man will take a look.\u201d\u201cPlease.\u201dZhuo Fan offered the scroll. The Long Jiu\u2019s smile vanished when he turned to its contents, staring intently at it.\u201cUncle Jiu, wasn\u2019t I right?\u201d Long Kui grinned and shouted, \u201c1st-grade array, thirty thousand spirit stones.\u201dLong Jiu kept staring at the drawing and only after a while did he spoke with a solemn face, \u201cI never thought the Luo clan would hide such a thing. Kid, what do you think of 1.8 million spirit stones?\u201dWhat?They all went slack-jawed, Long Kui in particular. Never had she dreamed of the day the supervisor of Veiled Dragon Pavilion, Long Jiu, would utter such an astronomical number\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Luo Yunchang never dreamed of having such riches. Yet in the eyes of Zhuo Fan, it wasn\u2019t enough.Luo Yunchang and Captain Pang looked lost at him. If not for being born and raised in the Cloud Manor, they\u2019d be thinking he was a noble descendant.His gaze traveled so far.Yet before others could recover from Zhuo Fan\u2019s attack, here came Long Jiu\u2019s reply.\u201cI understand, but this is the most this old man can give.\u201d\u201cUh, then I\u2019ll sell it as a favor for grandpa Jiu at this price.\u201d Luo Yunchang chuckled embarrassingly as she wiped her brow.She never imagined a random drawing from Zhuo Fan would garner such an insane price that took all of Godeye Long Jiu\u2019s wealth to pay for it.And by the looks of it, Long Jiu seemed to have set his sights on it. As such, it was better to earn his favor and be on good terms with Veiled Dragon Pavilion.Long Jiu showed a gratified smile, as expected, being extra careful as he rolled the drawing.But then, Zhuo Fan slapped the table, \u201cSince you can\u2019t go higher, the deal is off.\u201d\u201cZhuo Fan!\u201dLuo Yunchang gave him a look, but he ignored her as he reached for the scroll.Squinting his eyes, Long Jiu unleashed his awe-inspiring power, \u201cKid, this old man wants it.\u201dUnder such tremendous pressure, everyone recoiled, while Luo Yunchang and Captain Pang were overwhelmed from shock.Long Jiu was far above Cai Rong. Offending him would be tantamount to instant death.Yet, Zhuo held his own under the man\u2019s power and even sneered, \u201cGrandpa Jiu, you\u2019re staining Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s reputation.\u201d\u201cKid, are you not afraid?\u201d Long Jiu kicked his power up a notch.\u201cHumph, aren\u2019t you?\u201dBlanking out for a second, Long Jiu took back his power and laughed, \u201cHa-ha-ha, good kid. With you in charge of the Luo clan, they have nothing to worry about.\u201dThe others were baffled. The two were a step away from jumping at each other\u2019s throat and in the next instant all went up in smoke.Yet, no one knew the two moved the battle from brawn to mind.Long Jiu released his power to soften Zhuo Fan into selling him the drawing. Instead, Zhuo Fan pushed through the pressure and asked the old man about his honor. Veiled Dragon Pavilion was the number one appraising house among the seven nobles. If this coercion leaked then the damage would be unimaginable.Zhuo Fan bet on his fate and the clan\u2019s honor\u2019s place in Long Jiu\u2019s heart and won.With a deep look directed at Zhuo Fan, Long Jiu took the direct approach, \u201cKid, I know you didn\u2019t come just to sell this drawing. What are your terms?\u201dGrinning, Zhuo Fan pushed the drawing before Long Jiu, \u201cTen million is a fair offer. Let\u2019s start by having you pay us a million and the rest slowly.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dLong Jiu eyed the scroll then nodded after a while, \u201cAlright. Until the debt is paid, the Veiled Dragon Pavilion shall owe Luo clan.\u201dLong Jiu took the scroll and left. Yet once he was gone, his voice lingered, \u201cLittle Kui, give them a million spirit stones and walk them out.\u201d\u201cUh, yes!\u201dLong Kui was overwhelmed with different thoughts as she had never seen Long Jiu with such a sour expression. Turning back to Zhuo Fan, it was the first time she saw him sporting such a content smile.Next, she handed a million spirit stones and saw them out.At the gate, the two guards were eager for them to show up and teach them a thing or two, but Long Kui\u2019s respectful attitude threw a wrench in their plans. And when they heard the deal they made included a million spirit stones, they were stunned.Never had they imagined a remote place like this could come with such an important deal. It became one of the top three deals in Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s history.\u201cDamn, thank god we didn\u2019t do anything or disaster might have struck.\u201d A guard watched the four leave and wiped the sweat off his brow. The other just bobbed his head.Veiled Dragon Pavilion treated a rich clan with respect. If any of their men dared to offend the clan, the noble house would exact punishment.In the case of a clan with a million spirit stones, the guards\u2019 complete lack of courtesy would even end with their deaths.Thinking about it, they began to sweat buckets\u2026On the other hand, Long Kui returned to Long Jiu who was now looking at every detail of the 1st-grade array.\u201cUncle Jiu, isn\u2019t it just a 1st-grade array? How is this worth ten million? I never even seen an item worth that much.\u201d Long Kui asked the moment she went through the door.Sighing, Long Jiu gestured to her next to him, \u201cLittle Kui, look closer, this might be the only one of its kind in the empire.\u201d\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Long Kui\u2019s eyes flashed with shock.\u201cAn Ancient Array!\u201dLong Jiu showed how moved he was with every word, \u201cThe ancient arrays are a lost art, yet this has essentially proven their existence. It is priceless, and even ten million is too low.\u201d\u201cWhat? It\u2019s that valuable?\u201dNodding, Long Jiu revealed a childish smile, as if he got his most cherished toy. But something occurred to him that soured his mood.\u201cLittle Kui, tell Ah Jie to find five experts and watch over the Luo clan. They offended the Sun clan today.\u201d\u201cWhy should we help them?\u201dLong Jiu snorted, \u201cHaven\u2019t you been listening? We owe them.\u201dLong Kui began to recall. [So this is what Zhuo Fan and Long Jiu were haggling over.]Yet, the veteran uncle Jiu was defeated in negotiations by a pup. Of course he was in a bad mood.Long Kui couldn\u2019t help but let out a giggle\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Captain Pang rushed in with an anxious face.\u201cSun clan has us surrounded outside.\u201dSlowly opening his eyes, Zhuo Fan evoked an odd smile, \u201cThey\u2019re finally here.\u201d\u201cEh, why are you so calm?\u201dZhuo Fan walked outside without a care, \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for them. Tell the siblings to come out too.\u201dCaptain Pang couldn\u2019t help but roll his eyes helplessly. Zhuo Fan was the official Luo clan steward and called young miss and young master in other\u2019s presence, but when they were alone, he had no such restraints.If it were the past, Captain Pang would\u2019ve gone the distance in enacting the clan head\u2019s rules. But he got used to the tough-looking but soft-hearted Zhuo Fan. He had the habit of criticizing the siblings on and on, but he was the first to jump in front of them when the need arose.Just like yesterday, when he rebuked Luo Yunchang for speaking out of place and coming close to ruining their deal. Although wronged at the time, the young miss knew when they saw Long Jiu leaving that Zhuo Fan had done a great favor for the Luo clan.With how the rundown Luo clan turned in a million spirit stones, they wouldn\u2019t be in the precarious position of living on the streets or relying on others.What was most important was Long Jiu\u2019s evaluation of Zhuo Fan. As long as the Luo clan had him, it would soar.\u201cA capable man stands at the top!\u201d Captain Pang rubbed his chin, taking one last look of admiration at Zhuo Fan then went to get the siblings.Soon, Captain Pang accompanied them to Zhuo Fan in the tavern\u2019s hall. Luo Yunchang still bore the marks of grievance from yesterday\u2019s tongue-lashing on her face.\u201cLet\u2019s go, young miss and young master.\u201dZhuo Fan gestured outside with his eyes and Luo Yunchang snorted as she pulled her brother along.The tavern keeper opened the doors with a creak.Luo Yunchang showcased her young miss qualities by shifting her posture and expression to ones worthy of such status. Zhuo Fan even sighed inside that she was a prime example of a clan\u2019s lady.Thirty Sun clan guards stood outside, Qi Condensation experts. In the lead was Sun Yufei and a tall, dignified young master. He held a fan as his ghostly eyes roamed over Luo Yunchang\u2019s lithe figure.Noticing his gaze, Luo Yunchang shifted hers to Sun Yufei, \u201cWhy has young miss Sun brought so many people to look for us?\u201d\u201cHumph, why ask when you already know he offended this young miss in the Cai Manor!\u201d Sun Yufei pointed with hatred at Zhuo Fan, \u201cI will make sure to wipe out all of the Luo clan today!\u201dLuo Yunchang knitted her brows and pulled Luo Yunhai tighter, but a look at the relaxed Zhuo Fan eased her tension.It was in these moments of extreme danger, that Zhuo Fan dissolved all problems. Be it in front of Cai Rong or even Long Jiu, his cunningness and meticulous planning pulled them through.In front of those two experts, these people were nothing.Luo Yunchang knew, as long as Zhuo Fan was calm, the matter was as good as settled.Seeing Zhuo Fan unflinching, Luo Yunchang began to smile, lifting her chin with confidence, \u201cMy Luo clan had lorded over Windgaze City for centuries, you think we\u2019ll bend over just because you say so? Young miss Sun, your clan has only been here for just a few decades, please watch your tone.\u201dLuo Yunchang had finally recovered the lofty bearing she had in the time of Luo clan\u2019s prosperity. Such confidence left others speechless.The audience reduced Sun Yufei to a shrew servant while raising Luo Yunchang to a noble lady.Noticing their expressions, Sun Yufei\u2019s face was inflamed, bursting with Yuan Qi, \u201cLuo Yunchang, I will teach you the meaning of a fallen clan.\u201dShe charged for her and Captain Pang rushed to protect his young miss. But before they could meet, a fan rested between them.\u201cCousin\u2026\u201d Sun Yufei watched him with bloodshot eyes.Without paying her any attention, he showed respect towards Luo Yunchang, \u201cYoung miss Luo, please forgive my cousin\u2019s lack of manners. We have come to your home for your steward to seek justice for my cousin. It does not concern young miss. If you hand him over, I guarantee not to harm any Luo clan member.\u201d\u201cCousin, didn\u2019t we say we\u2019re going to destroy them, why\u2026\u201d Sun Yufei was panicking, but he covered her face with the fan.\u201cI could also bring back the glory of old to the Luo clan.\u201d\u201cNo need, Zhuo Fan is part of the Luo clan. If you\u2019re looking to trouble him you\u2019re dealing with the whole clan. If you have any complaints, come to me. I am in charge of the Luo clan.\u201d Luo Yunchang stood fearless before all.Losing his smile, the youngster shook his head, \u201cI urge young miss to not be taken in by emotions. If you knew who I am, you might not say the same.\u201dFrowning, Luo Yunchang glared at him.\u201cI am You Quan, a disciple of Hell Valley.\u201d\u201cWh-\u201d Luo Yunchang was shocked and took two steps back, \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Seven Noble Houses\u2026\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, scared now?\u201d Sun Yufei laughed with pride.Everyone, besides Zhuo Fan, sported grim expressions. There was no reason to fear meeting Long Jiu since they were negotiating, but in this case, they were at odds with the Hell Valley.Any from the Seven Noble Houses needed to only lift a finger and a mortal clan would fall or thrive. No wonder even the Clan Head Cai Rong saw the Sun clan girl with importance, her clan had a connection with the Seven Noble Houses.\u201cZhuo Fan\u2026\u201dLuo Yunchang grabbed his hand as her voice trembled.With a reassuring smile, he stepped forward, \u201cI am Luo clan\u2019s steward, Zhuo Fan. What do you think of fighting one on one?\u201d\u201cHumph, cousin was right, you are an arrogant slave,\u201d sneered You Quan as he approached him, \u201cAll of us against someone like you will smear Hell Valley\u2019s reputation.\u201dWith his last word, a whoosh sound traveled and You Quan disappeared.Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes narrowed, somersaulting backward. When he looked forward, a trace of blood flowed down his face.As blood dripped from his cheek, the youth now occupied Zhuo Fan\u2019s previous position.\u201cHumph, so you\u2019ve managed to dodge it.\u201d You Quan eyed him evilly, as if he was toying with him.[6th layer of Qi Condensation, demonic cultivator.]Zhuo Fan squinted and smiled, \u201cInteresting.\u201dWhen You Quan attacked like a demon, if Zhuo Fan wasn\u2019t a veteran demonic cultivator, it would\u2019ve killed him. But this revealed Hell Valley\u2019s nature, that of a demonic faction.If another met such a problem, he\u2019d have a hard time coping.Demonic cultivators gained power through any means, filled with danger and ruthless natures. Righteous cultivators took the opposite approach, taking it one step at a time. They weren\u2019t as impressive as demonic cultivation experts, but they hardly encountered problems in cultivation.And this explained why despite only in his 6th layer, You Quan was far more dangerous. Yet Zhuo was in the 2nd, and four layers difference would make him hard-pressed even against a righteous cultivator.Luck had it though that Zhuo Fan was an old monster in demonic cultivation, knowing his fair share of its arts and methods. This was his only hope of success.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Luo Yunchang was anxious, watching the blood trail down his cheek.He wiped the blood and showed an excited smile. It wasn\u2019t that he never fought with higher layers before, just that they were all righteous cultivators. This was his first encounter with a demonic cultivator in this situation and began to enjoy the novelty of it.\u201cFight!\u201dEven if the Luo clan wasn\u2019t here, it was still important to go through with this fight for the sake of his meticulous schemes. This fight followed no logic, as his boiling blood dictated his movements.The bloodthirsty look in Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes caught You Quan off guard.Common sense told him his first move should have robbed Zhuo Fan of his life, and even if he escaped by some miracle, he\u2019d be scared witless. But instead of fear, Zhuo Fan showed thrill and thirst for battle.\u201cCan it be\u2026\u201dYou Quan thought of something but was forced to block.Bam!A blood palm exploded in his hand, pushing him back again and again. When he finally stopped, his hand was dripping blood.\u201cCousin, be careful. Even Cai Rong suffered from this palm.\u201d Sun Yufei advised.You Quan frowned, his casual expression turning grave, \u201cThis is going to be a pain. Never thought I\u2019d meet someone like him\u2026\u201dHe saw Zhuo Fan sporting a grin and he sighed inside, while also raising his vigilance.[If I had known, I wouldn\u2019t have caught myself in this\u2026]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Meanwhile, the righteous path followed set rules to form a solid foundation and advance one step at a time. Because of this savage pursuit, demonic cultivators were seen as madmen, resorting to any despicable means to further their might. This was why righteous cultivators feared them.Fighting them was tantamount to fighting a madman.With this knowledge in mind, You Quan began to regret fighting Zhuo Fan. Despite being confident in his success, fighting an unscrupulous demonic cultivator would be sure to come with negative repercussions on his part.\u201cI need to settle this quickly.\u201d You Quan\u2019s eyes flashed with murderous intent and dark-blue energy came out of his palm.The air around him chilled in an instant and even Luo Yunchang, who was ten feet away, felt the cold biting her.She was aware of its danger and her heart was in a panic. But before she could warn Zhuo Fan, You Quan turned into a black shadow and charged. All the flowers along the way wilted.\u201cHigh mortal ranked martial art, Hell Claw.\u201dBam!The blackish cold energy struck Zhuo Fan\u2019s chest until the latter spat blood along with pieces of ice.\u201cHumph, I have your heart. No matter what you\u2019re trying to do, it\u2019s useless.\u201dYou Quan was pleased his sudden strike worked and relaxed.There were four layers of power between them, and even if demonic cultivators, no matter the weird techniques or savagery, once one\u2019s heart was in a vice, he couldn\u2019t use most of his power. It was the same as being powerless.Sun Yufei cheered at her cousin\u2019s success, \u201cKill him.\u201d While Luo Yunchang and the others were nervous.Nodding inside, despite knowing his cousin was rash and prone to anger, You Quan had to admit her words this time were true. A demonic cultivator enemy must never be left alive.Because a demonic cultivator\u2019s vengeance will always be ruthless.Now, another dark-blue palm aimed for Zhuo Fan\u2019s head, \u201cHumph, die!\u201dLuo Yunchang and the rest were in shock, hearts in their throats.But following an explosive sound, Zhuo Fan\u2019s head was fine while You Quan was flung like a ragdoll, trailing a bloody arc in the air.\u201cBlood Palm!\u201d Zhuo Fan bellowed, staying in the move executing stance.\u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201dYou Quan crawled to his feet and clasped his chest with an incredulous expression, \u201cI sealed your heart, how can you still use martial arts?\u201d\u201cHumph, there\u2019s nothing bro Zhuo Fan can\u2019t do!\u201d Luo Yunhai stuck his chin out as Luo Yunchang and the others chuckled in relief.But then, Zhuo Fan spat out another mouthful of blood. A sudden hole was now adorning his chest, which leaked blood.\u201cWh-what\u2019s going on?\u201d Luo Yunchang was stunned while Captain Pang rushed to support the collapsing Zhuo Fan.Only You Quan understood and cackled, \u201cHe seemed to have exploded his heart on purpose when I used my skill on him to break out of Hell Claw\u2019s grip. He won\u2019t have long to live.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Luo Yunchang was nervous.Ignoring her, You Quan ridiculed the hazy eyed Zhuo Fan, \u201cSuch a pity. If you were at my stage, your move would have ended with mutual destruction. But it ended with quickening your death. Even hurt, I can finish you off.\u201dHe rushed for Zhuo Fan and, though his speed dropped, it wasn\u2019t something Luo Yunchang and the others could cope with.\u201cNo!\u201d Luo Yunchang jumped in front of Zhuo Fan with her arms spread. You Quan sneered, \u201cHe-he-he, young miss Luo, I would hate to kill you.\u201dWhoosh!The Luo clan members saw You Quan\u2019s claw but were powerless to stop it from approaching Zhuo Fan\u2019s head.You Quan wanted to kill Zhuo Fan in front of them.Sensing the incoming danger, Zhuo Fan gave out a strange smile.Bam!Suddenly, the blackish claw was caught in a vice-like grip.\u201cMid mortal ranked martial art, Hidden Dragon Claw?\u201dYou Quan raised his head to find a warm face greeting him. It belonged to a youth of around eighteen, dressed in golden clothes and a scholarly face, yet having a sharp pair of eyes.\u201cLong Jie?\u201d You Quan gnashed his teeth.Sun Yufei was in shock, \u201cVeiled Dragon Pavilion\u2026\u201d\u201cYou Quan, do you need to kill for every little mistake?\u201d Long Jie smiled.\u201cHumph, that\u2019s my business, butt out.\u201dShaking his head, Long Jie might look kind, but there was a certain determination in his eyes, \u201cI was ordered by Uncle Jiu to protect the Luo clan. If you want to kill him, you have to go through me.\u201d\u201cWhy is the Veiled Dragon Pavilion suddenly\u2026\u201dSun Yufei trembled, never imagining the Luo clan could gain the help of Veiled Dragon Pavilion.The Sun clan was under the protection of Hell Valley and even though the Luo clan only had four people, they had the Veiled Dragon Pavilion to back them. Based on background, the only clan that could fight the Sun clan in Windgaze City was the Luo clan.This deflated Sun Yufei\u2019s superiority. A clan under Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s backing was bound to rise.Gazing at Luo Yunchang, Sun Yufei hardly hid the hatred in her eyes.\u201cHumph, Long Jie, we have the same strength. You think you can protect them?\u201d You Quan looked at Zhuo Fan hanging by a thread with killing intent.With a serious face, Long Jie said with coldness, \u201cYou Quan, don\u2019t forget your wounds. Think you can match me as you are now?\u201dBefore he could retort, Long Jie said, \u201cI know what you want to say, that a demonic cultivator can show 120% of his power. But if we fight here, it will incur an open war between our houses. Are you prepared to bear such responsibility?\u201dYou Quan hesitated.Hell Valley and Veiled Dragon Pavilion were of the Seven Noble Houses, yet also at odds. It was only a matter of time till war broke out, but not now. If he ruined his clan\u2019s plan, he wouldn\u2019t be able to bear the repercussions.\u201cAl-\u201cJust when he nodded, a hand grabbed at his chest.He rushed his Yuan Qi in a panic to block the attack, but a sudden blood energy messed up his control. In but an instant, the hand pierced his chest and gripped his heart.\u201cDidn\u2019t your Master warn you? In a battle with demonic cultivators, never let down your guard or you will forfeit your life.\u201dA familiar voice reached You Quan\u2019s ears while his eyes were greeted with Zhuo Fan\u2019s evil grin.\u201cY-you can\u2019t\u2026\u201d You Quan was in shock.Zhao Fan was on the brink of death yet, now, had the energy to move around. But what was even more baffling was that he was stronger and faster than when Zhuo Fan first fought him\u2026Everything was clear now. He fell in his trap, and not just him\u2026He turned to the equally shocked Long Jie with an imploring gaze.[Save me\u2026]\u201cDie!\u201d Zhuo Fan\u2019s demonic voice echoed in the two\u2019s ears and both shouted, \u201cNo!\u201dIt was too late. Zhuo Fan already gouged out You Quan\u2019s heart. Blood flowed like a fountain from You Quan\u2019s chest as he collapsed.He didn\u2019t want to fight a demonic cultivator since every move was planned and vicious\u2026\u201cCousin!\u201dSun Yufei cried in pain as she walked in a daze to his body. Sun clan\u2019s guards took her and left in a rush. They no longer had a backing and this place was filled with Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s men.The calm Long Jie, witnessing death for the first time, swallowed dryly and turned to Zhuo Fan. He saw the still-beating heart in Zhuo Fan\u2019s hand and broke out in a sweat.He saw his fair share of demonic cultivators but Zhuo Fan horrified him the most. If he compared them, those demonic cultivators he saw were noblemen when up against Zhuo Fan\u2019s methods.\u201cYou\u2019re the one grandpa Jiu sent to protect us? Thanks for the help. Please send him a message, that we no longer need protection.\u201d Zhuo Fan flung the heart and clasped his hands.Long Jie returned the gesture with a bitter smile. Then he left without a word, like a defeated general.Six hours later, inside Veiled Dragon Pavilion.Bam!Long Jiu smacked the table in a fit of anger as his only eye was on the verge of popping out. Long Jie and Long Kui stood with heads bowed, not daring to make a peep.\u201cNever thought I\u2019d see the day I, Long Jiu, who moved unhindered across the world, was had today by a brat. To think he would ruin all of our clan\u2019s plans.\u201dLong Kui hesitated and asked, \u201cUncle Jiu, I do not understand. What does Zhuo Fan\u2019s sneak attack have to do with Veiled Dragon Pavilion?\u201d\u201cFoolish child.\u201d Long Jiu cursed, \u201cAh Jie was there and was at odds with You Quan, everyone saw it. That punk killed You Quan right before Ah Jie. You tell me, who will the blame will fall on?\u201d\u201cLuo clan!\u201d Long Kui said like it was obvious.Long Jiu laughed as he shook his head. Long Jiu explained, \u201cLittle Kui, do you believe a small clan would dare to kill a disciple of the Seven Noble Houses?\u201dLong Kui shook her head after thinking it over.Long Jie continued, \u201cIf even you don\u2019t believe it, then Hell Valley and Sun clan will surely refuse to. They will blame us.\u201d\u201cWhat? But that will mean we\u2019re the ones down on our luck. Why should we be the Luo clan\u2019s scapegoat?\u201d\u201cHumph, luck? All of this is the work of that punk. From Ah Jie, I understand the kid was on the verge of dying when he arrived. Even if You Quan wanted his life, he couldn\u2019t do anything since Ah Jie stopped him. Then he sneak attacked him with a stronger move then in the beginning. This clearly states how cunning he was and that he planned ahead.\u201d\u201cWhat? Does that mean he knew brother Long Jie was there from the start and targeted You Quan?\u201d Long Kui exclaimed.Sighing, Luo clan shook his head in helplessness, \u201cSilly girl, not only did he plan against You Quan, but he also included Veiled Dragon Pavilion and Hell Valley in his calculations. Our houses would fight while his Luo clan escapes.\u201d\u201cImpossible! Isn\u2019t he afraid of offending two houses?\u201d\u201cHe thought this one out too. When he sold us that drawing, he already ascertained our house\u2019s position. If we attack them or ignore the Luo clan\u2019s plight, it is the same as showing weakness in front of Hell Valley, damaging our Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s honor. Our only choice is to protect the Luo clan.\u201cSigh, he had me from the start\u2026 This punk is the most dangerous man I have ever seen.\u201dRecalling the previous scene, Long Jie had to nod his head in agreement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 - ConspiracyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cGet out!\u201dIn the dead of night, Zhuo Fan was trying hard to staunch the flow of blood from his chest while sitting on the bed. Luo Yunchang wanted to help him but Zhuo Fan\u2019s bellow drove her out.Despite winning against You Quan, his victory wasn\u2019t a sweet one.If not for his sneak attack, the fight would\u2019ve been one-sided, a common occurrence when demonic cultivators were involved. But he felt a deep sense of powerlessness from today\u2019s fight.Although they were 4 layers apart, he believed himself to be a Demonic Emperor, that using all his power would have certainly finished off a kid still wet behind his ears.Yet reality showed that not only he couldn\u2019t win, but he also couldn\u2019t even get the upper hand in the fight. He had to rely on scheming to lure Veiled Dragon Pavilion out in the open and kill his enemy when he least expected by inciting chaos among the houses, while also providing the Luo clan a way out.It all went according to plan, yet it didn\u2019t leave a good taste in his mouth.\u201cToo weak\u2026\u201dTo get rid of their trouble with the Cai clan and Sun clan, they got tangled up in the Seven Noble Houses\u2019 conflict. It was trading one poison for another. All was quiet for now, but they\u2019d have to face the music sooner or later.Yet, with his meager power, he couldn\u2019t protect himself, let alone the Luo clan.\u201cI need to get stronger fast!\u201dZhuo Fan clenched his teeth and performed strange hand gestures as his eyes let out an eerie red light.At this moment, Cai Xiaoting was meditating in a room when a sudden ache in his abdomen twisted his face in pain. Beads of sweat rolled down his forehead and he soon passed out.A bloody light flashed from his abdomen and a palm-sized infant came out.It was Zhuo Fan\u2019s Blood Infant.At the time he was in Cai Manor, Zhuo Fan inserted the Blood Infant in Cai Xiaoting, to control Cai Rong. Because his movement was too fast, no one saw him. And under the threat of his son\u2019s life, Cai Rong was forced to let the Luo clan go.Thanks to the Blood Infant in Cai Xiaoting\u2019s body, Zhuo Fan could monitor their affairs. He would get an early warning to any plan they might come up with.But now, spying on the Cai clan has lost its value.The Blood Infant saw the unconscious Cai Xiaoting and let out a sneer in Zhuo Fan\u2019s voice, \u201cHumph, I won\u2019t take your life so you could bear witness to the fall of the Cai clan.\u201dThe Blood Infant then turned into a red light and flew outside.In a dark garden, a Cai clan guard was patrolling when a red light entered his body. He couldn\u2019t utter a sound as his body numbed. He soon shriveled up and a light wind scattered him to dust, leaving behind the red glow.In this manner, more than thirty guards disappeared from the Cai clan.In the tavern, Zhuo Fan snickered and sent Blood Infant for the next prey.He and the Blood Infant were one. When the Blood Infant entered a cultivator, he used the Demon Transformation Art to absorb the person\u2019s blood essence and Yuan Qi for Zhuo Fan to refine later.He didn\u2019t plan on using the Blood Infant so soon, but he needed it to heal his heart. So he might as well reduce Cai clan\u2019s numbers while he was at it.The Blood Infant reached the Qi Condensation and even an early Bone Tempering expert would find it troublesome to fight with. As for Qi Condensation opponents, it would kill them in an instant.If Zhuo Fan had the Blood Infant on him in his fight with You Quan, he could\u2019ve won without having to resort to any schemes.He could only sigh as he thought of how it was the perfect match to have both the Blood Infant and the Demon Transformation Art.Raising the Blood Infant was very difficult, and even Patriarch Blood Demon only reached Saint Stage with it. Yet, thanks to the Demon Transformation Art, Zhuo Fan raised it to Qi Condensation after ten days of hard work in the tavern.He did it during his previous seclusion. The first day he used to bind the Blood Infant and the rest to provide it with blood essence. Since the Blood Infant reached such a level, it was time for it to collect blood essence.And in a clan like the Cai clan, Bone Tempering experts were rare, so Zhuo Fan wasn\u2019t afraid the Blood Infant would be harmed. This led to an unrestrained hunt as he sucked dry fifty more guards.But just when he planned to wipe away any Cai clan remnants, an eerie energy caught his attention.\u201cA Demonic cultivator expert?\u201dZhuo Fan was startled and guided the Blood Infant to the source.It arrived near a small room, where a faint light burned. There were two dozen peak Qi Condensation cultivators standing guard.It stirred Zhuo Fan\u2019s curiosity and drew Blood Infant to a window. As for those guards, they couldn\u2019t even detect the Blood Infant, not to mention see it.Three elderly sat in the guest and main seats inside the room.The one in the main seat was Cai Rong. The first seat on his left was occupied by a bald old man with cloudy eyes and exuding a peculiar energy.Zhuo Fan recognized it in a second, it was from a demonic cultivator expert.The old man on Cai Rong\u2019s right wore noble attire and faint traces of demonic energy leaked from him. It showed he was in the middle of changing to a demonic cultivation method.Yet Cai Rong and the noble dressed old man were showing great respect to the bald demonic cultivator.[Can it be\u2026]Zhuo Fan felt he was onto something when Clan Head cupped his hands before the bald man, \u201cElder Jian, to what do I owe the honor of your and Clan Head Sun\u2019s visit?\u201dCloudy eyes stared at Cai Rong until he trembled. It was then that Elder Jian smiled, \u201cI\u2019m sure you know that a disciple from my Hell Valley was killed today by a Veiled Dragon Pavilion.\u201d\u201cUhm, wasn\u2019t it done by the Luo clan?\u201d Cai Rong let out a dry laugh.\u201cYou think the Luo clan would have the nerve?\u201d Elder Jian laughed as his cloudy eyes shined, \u201cThe feud between my Hell Valley and Veiled Dragon Pavilion was at a stalemate where neither dared to make the first move and break the balance of the seven houses. Yet the Veiled Dragon Pavilion used the Luo clan to kill my disciple. What are they aiming for?\u201dThis made Zhuo Fan muffle his laughter.Just as he expected, these seven houses were treated like kings for so many years that they would never believe anyone would challenge their authority. It was because of such raw arrogance that made them believe there was a deeper scheme involved instead of taking what happened at face value.Veiled Dragon Pavilion was no different, willing to accept this injustice instead of showing weakness.\u201cUh, then you visited me because\u2026\u201d Cai Rong hesitated.\u201cHa-ha-ha, nothing much, just help us to spy on Veiled Dragon Pavilion and understand their intent. It seems this event will trigger a battle between the houses.\u201d\u201cUhm\u2026 Elder Jian, that\u2019s the Veiled Dragon Pavilion. My Cai clan can\u2019t afford to offend them.\u201d Cai Rong panicked.He thought, [Why the hell are you Seven Noble Houses dragging my small clan into this?]Shaking his head, Elder Jian said, \u201cClan Head Cai, don\u2019t misunderstand. There is no need for your clan to go head to head with Veiled Dragon Pavilion. It\u2019s just testing them, that is, dealing with the Luo clan and observing the Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s reaction.\u201d\u201cWhat, Luo clan?\u201dCai Rong was shocked.There wasn\u2019t anyone in the Windgaze City who didn\u2019t know of today\u2019s fight between You Quan and Zhuo Fan, that Luo clan was backed by the Veiled Dragon Pavilion. [Yet here you are asking me to go make a mess of Luo clan. Isn\u2019t that the same as offending the Veiled Dragon Pavilion?]Cai Rong looked over at Clan Head Sun, only to see him smile with a hint of schadenfreude.[Damn you! Since you\u2019re so close with Hell Valley, why don\u2019t you go mess with Luo clan? Didn\u2019t your daughter make a scene today? But now that you saw them with the Veiled Dragon Pavilion, you don\u2019t dare move an inch.]Cai Rong felt his tooth itch from hatred but didn\u2019t have the courage to refuse Hell Valley, \u201cAi, to tell the truth, I hate that punk, Zhuo Fan, the most. He came to my clan a few days ago to look for trouble. I don\u2019t know what evil trick he used, but he made my son cough blood for several days and we still haven\u2019t found a cure. If I go after him, he would use the same trick to take my son\u2019s life\u2026\u201dPff\u2026Before Cai Rong even finished, Zhuo Fan could barely hold his laughter.He left the Blood Infant inside Cai Xiaoting to teach the Cai clan a lesson, but never used it again afterward. He didn\u2019t expect the Clan Head would use such a lame excuse to escape this predicament.Even Elder Jian was skeptical of Cai Rong\u2019s flowery speech and his face hardened.Upon seeing this, Cai Rong rushed to present an alternative, \u201cElder Jian, Clan Head Sun is the best man for the job and is also close with Hell Valley. Letting him in charge of this task won\u2019t disappoint you.\u201d\u201cHey, Cai Rong, what are you trying to pull?\u201dClan Head Sun jumped to his feet. Luo clan was a headache and they didn\u2019t know how tight its relation was with the Veiled Dragon Pavilion. If he\u2019d instigated Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s involvement when he messed with the Luo clan, he\u2019d be ruined.Despite the Sun clan and Hell Valley being related, the former was by no means one of the Seven Noble Houses. Getting on the Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s wrong side was out of the question. It was unknown if the Hell Valley would stick its neck out for the Sun clan.Going after Luo clan was plain suicide.Seeing the two clans proclaim loyalty by day and shirking off their duties at crucial times, Elder Jian snapped, \u201cEnough, you useless fools, I don\u2019t need any of you. I will find someone else for the job.\u201cAlso, Cai Rong, have you brought your spirit ranked martial art, Wind Kick?\u201d\u201cPlease inspect it, Elder Jian.\u201d Cai clan rushed to present the jade slip, yet his eyes showed reluctance, \u201cElder Jian, this is the only spirit ranked martial art the ancestors have passed down in my Cai clan.\u201d\u201cFine, I won\u2019t take advantage of you.\u201d Snorting, Elder Jian threw him a jade slip, \u201cThis is the spirit ranked martial art, Flaming Finger, a higher rank than yours.\u201dCai Rong was overjoyed, expressing his thanks again and again. Zhuo Fan standing outside was puzzled, [Is Hell Valley muddled to exchange a mid spirit ranked martial art for a lower one?]\u201cElder Jian, who did you find to deal with Luo clan, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201dIgnoring the martial art the Hell Valley bestowed on Cai Rong, Clan Head Sun asked. Cai Rong pricked up his ears to catch the answer.Snickering, Elder Jian\u2019s eyes flashed with disdain, \u201cYou bunch of dogs, afraid someone might replace you? Humph, relax will you, that person is from Hell Valley.\u201d\u201cDoes the Hell Valley plan to step forward? Why\u2026\u201d Cai Rong and Clan Head Sun didn\u2019t mind Elder Jian\u2019s disdain and were surprised.With an odd light in his eyes, Elder Jian said, \u201cHe is a spy we have long planted in the Blackwind Mountain\u2026\u201d\u201cBlackwind Mountain!\u201dZhuo Fan was so shocked his heart skipped a beat and his control over his energy slipped.\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201dElder Jian whipped his head and launched a palm attack. The door was blown to pieces as Blood Infant turned into a red streak of light and flew away.Only now did Elder Jian rush outside.\u201cSo quick!\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s shock wasn\u2019t small, but luck was with him as the guards were surrounding the place. He grinned and urged the Blood Infant to enter one of them.\u201cBlood Boil!\u201dThe guards were in shock as Zhuo Fan\u2019s shout blew up the guard. With no time to dodge, all the others next to him lost their lives.Elder Jian\u2019s figure was blocked by the sudden explosion, allowing Blood Infant\u2019s escape.Cai Rong and Clan Head Sun saw the wretched aftermath and were frightened, \u201cWhat was that?\u201dElder Jian shook his head, yet his face turned grave, \u201cI don\u2019t know, but it must belong to a demonic cultivator\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 - Breakthrough AgainPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhoosh!A red light streaked in the dead of night, passing through doors and entering Zhuo Fan\u2019s body.Letting out a breath, Zhuo Fan opened his eyes as he rejoiced. Fortunately, the Blood Infant was quick to escape or it would\u2019ve been ruined by the bald elder.He never imagined he\u2019d bump into such a strong opponent in the Cai clan. Even if he couldn\u2019t recognize the elder\u2019s cultivation, he was certain the elder was no less powerful than Godeye Long Jiu.And once Blood Infant was destroyed, because of Zhuo Fan\u2019s connection with it, it would spell doom for him too. But the opposite was also true. Even if his heart exploded, he wouldn\u2019t die as long as the Blood Infant lived; because the moment he bound with the Blood Infant, it became his heart.\u201cI need to work harder on improving my strength.\u201dHis vast experience told him danger was looming. For now, it looked like Hell Valley and Veiled Dragon Pavilion were silent, but the Blackwind Mountain might be the fuse to a disaster with the Luo clan smack in the middle.His fate rested on strengthening the Blood Infant to Bone Tempering Stage. This was the only way to ensure some semblance of control when he met an expert like Long Jiu.Zhuo Fan closed his eyes and refined the Yuan Qi and blood essence the Blood Infant collected.In the next moment, red flashes came from his chest as red energy coursed through his veins to his heart. As the energy gathered the whole in his chest began to heal. His weak heartbeat soon started pounding with greater force.In but an hour, his chest healed, with not even a scar left behind. If one didn\u2019t witness his heart exploding, they wouldn\u2019t believe the events of this morning occurred.He continued refining Blood Infant\u2019s gathered Yuan Qi and turning into black energy. One part flowed into his Dantian and another back to the Blood Infant.No less than 50 Qi Condensation experts\u2019 Yuan Qi were refined and propelled Zhuo Fan through the 3rd layer of Qi Condensation and to the brink of entering the 4th layer.With a faint boom, Zhuo Fan and Blood Infant broke through to the 4th layer.Zhuo Fan was happy. It was so easy to increase one\u2019s strength. It was only ten days ago that he entered the 2nd layer and here he was now in the 4th.But when he wanted to work towards the 5th layer, he found Blood Infant\u2019s Yuan Qi reserves had been spent.He wanted to keep going, but he was satisfied he at least advanced two layers in one go.He looked out the window at the clearing sky and walked out to stretch his legs. Now that Blackwind Mountain was coming, he had to find a safe haven for the Luo clan.Zhuo Fan opened the door to his room but before he could take a step, a thump resounded and something fell at his feet. He looked to see a drowsy Luo Yunchang getting back up in embarrassment.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Zhuo Fan frowned.He poured all his focus on controlling the Blood Infant last night and then cultivating, so he didn\u2019t pay attention to what happened outside his room to the point he didn\u2019t detect her.[Damn it! How could I become so careless? If it were an enemy instead, I would\u2019ve been dead.]Seeing his angry look, Luo Yunchang was apologetic as she mumbled, \u201cI was worried about your wounds worsening and waited outside. Now that you\u2019re alright, I\u2019ll be going. \u201c\u201cWait, you stood guard all night?\u201d Zhuo Fan was shocked.Luo Yunchang blushed and turned to leave with a hurried pace than before.Captain Pang took this moment to appear and saw Zhuo safe and sound and shouted in joy, \u201cBrother Zhuo, you\u2019ve recovered. That wound of yours scared all of us to death. Young miss always stayed at your door, worried for your life. Eh, where is she?\u201d\u201cShe left.\u201dZhuo Fan rubbed his nose and said calmly, yet warmth grew in his heart.[Damn this heart demon!]Zhuo Fan cursed. How could the glorious Demonic Emperor feel anything for a mere woman? [This must be the work of the kid\u2019s heart demon.]\u201cRight, old Pang, you came right on time. Come with me to the Veiled Dragon Pavilion.\u201d\u201cBut what about young miss and\u2026\u201d\u201cRelax, after yesterday\u2019s event, no one would dare touch them, if not for fear of offending Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2026\u201d Zhuo Fan snickered.Captain Pang had to take a moment to recover and reacted by giving thumbs up as his eyes glittered with worship. He didn\u2019t get Zhuo Fan\u2019s plan but he was clear Zhuo Fan made others misunderstand Veiled Dragon Pavilion was backing Luo clan.\u201cSteward Zhuo, I am now thoroughly convinced. If the Luo clan doesn\u2019t have you as a steward, we would have been doomed. It was a waste of your talents to have left you sweeping the courtyard back in the day.\u201dLaughing, Zhuo Fan patted Captain Pang\u2019s shoulder and shook his head.[That person wasn\u2019t me\u2026]Fifteen minutes later found the two at the gates of Veiled Dragon Pavilion, before the same two guards. But this time, they showed proper respect.\u201cPlease enter, dear guests.\u201d\u201cWhat, you won\u2019t go and report first?\u201d Zhuo Fan mocked.After giving a silly laugh, a guard knew Zhuo Fan was still bothered by what happened before and apologized, \u201cIt was us who were ignorant before and didn\u2019t recognize your greatness. You made a deal of a million spirit stones. We do not have the right to block such an honorable guest.\u201d\u201cHumph, snobs!\u201d Zhuo Fan sneered then took Captain Pang inside, leaving the guards still bent and flattering him. They were clearly miserable inside but still plastered a fake smile on their faces.The two ran into Long Kui. This time, she lacked the respect she showed before and snorted in anger as she walked away.\u201cUhm, how did we offended her?\u201d Captain Pang was baffled.Zhuo Fan smiled.\u201cYoung miss Long Kui, is this how Veiled Dragon Pavilion treats its guests?\u201d\u201cHumph, how are you guests?\u201d Raising an eyebrow, she glared at him, \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve to be guests when you used us!\u201dRubbing his chin, Zhuo Fan smiled and muttered, \u201cStill just a girl, and so naive.\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s voice was faint but not enough to prevent the disdain in his voice from reaching Long Kui. She was treated as the jewel of the clan, and never received such contempt, especially from people around her age.\u201cZhuo Fan, who are you calling naive?\u201d\u201cYou, of course!\u201d Zhuo Fan smiled, \u201cBe it business or the politics between the seven houses, everything must be taken into consideration when looking to make a profit. Yet you are prone to anger just from being used in someone else\u2019s plan. Just how did you survive this long? Compared to you, Long Jie is much more mature. He realized I used him and just walked away instead. The way I see it, admitting a loss is also a kind of power. At least the next time I plan on using him, it won\u2019t be as easy.\u201dThis was the first time Long Kui heard such an argument and was stunned.She came from the clan\u2019s estate and was put in Long Jiu\u2019s care. The elders in the estate spoke highly of her talent but not enough to entrust her with heavy responsibility. When she arrived here, Long Jiu spoke the same. Her talent wasn\u2019t any less than Long Jie but Long Jiu didn\u2019t trust her in being responsible.She didn\u2019t understand, but now it seemed she was clear on something\u2026\u201cLove, hate, closeness, and vengeance won\u2019t help you, only benefits.\u201d Zhuo Fan saw her bewildered eyes and chuckled, \u201cLet\u2019s set aside our personal grievances and talk about business. It is also where your talent lies.\u201dLong Kui thought for a bit and nodded.But just then a light cough came, along with an aged voice, \u201cMister Zhuo Fan, let\u2019s talk.\u201dThe three of them looked to see Long Jiu accompanied by Long Jie walking towards them. But Long Jie couldn\u2019t mask a glint of shock as he gazed upon Zhuo Fan.Yesterday, he saw Zhuo Fan\u2019s heart exploding, but now, he was walking like it never happened. His breath was even and spoke calmly.[Did he recover in one night? How?]\u201cGrandpa Jiu, won\u2019t you give this young one a chance?\u201d Not paying any heed to Long Jie\u2019s shock, Zhuo Fan spoke.Shaking his head, Long Jiu laughed, \u201cHa-ha-ha, just from talking with you, I ended up being used in the end. To think you still dare to come here. If I knew your true colors before, I would\u2019ve taken you as a thousand-year-old monster taking shelter in the Luo clan.\u201d[Damn! I almost got found out!]Zhuo Fan forced a laugh as he dismissed him, \u201cYou\u2019re too kind, grandpa Jiu. How can I compare to you?\u201d\u201cCut the crap!\u201d Long Jiu switched tones in an instant and said harshly, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\u201cI am looking for a safe house for the Luo clan to live in. Does grandpa Jiu know of a good place?\u201dStroking his beard, Long Jiu replied, \u201cWhy should I help you?\u201d\u201cSimple, Veiled Dragon Pavilion owes us! Also\u2026\u201d Zhuo Fan laughed eerily, \u201cIt will help you watch over us more easily.\u201dLong Jiu\u2019s eyes squinted as his heart trembled in shock.[This punk can see through anyone. Ever since killing You Quan yesterday, Veiled Dragon Pavilion has been on the defensive. With how tense our relation with Hell Valley is now, a battle might break out at any time.]And Luo clan was a variable because of their connection with Veiled Dragon Pavilion, no one dared to mess with it, but it also allowed the Luo clan to do whatever it wanted. One wrong move and it could trigger a war between the houses.This was why Long Jiu placed surveillance over the Luo clan. Yet, Zhuo Fan went and exposed it. This left Long Jiu feeling apprehensive.[What is this punk scheming?]He never imagined a veteran practitioner a century-old would one day be toyed with by a punk. And he didn\u2019t understand the whole picture either, leaving him with an unpleasant feeling\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What I know doesn\u2019t mean you do as well.\u201dLong Kui grinned unconvinced. Long Jie also shook his head. But only Long Jiu fixed his single eye on Zhuo Fan.Long Jiu wouldn\u2019t even care if it were anyone else. But it concerned Zhuo Fan, who gave them too many shocks these past days. He began to add a certain importance to the youth before him.\u201cLet\u2019s hear it!\u201dSnickering, Zhuo Fan said, \u201cDid you know Hell Valley\u2019s men are already here?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dLong Jiu shouted in shock.Since the founding of the empire, the Seven Noble Houses\u2019 domains had clear boundaries. Windgaze City was Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s and no other house was allowed to establish a branch here or it would be taken as provocation and war would break out.Of course, their disciples were the exception, as it could be seen from Veiled Dragon Pavilion ignoring You Quan\u2019s arrival. However, this didn\u2019t extend to elders or similar experts, they needed consent first.Zhuo Fan knew of this rule from Luo Yunchang and was now probing. It went just as he thought. From their faces, they had no idea the bald old man was here.\u201cImpossible, we have scouts all over Windgaze City and no one can escape our notice.\u201d Long Jie shook his head with a grim look.\u201cHumph, don\u2019t listen to him. He just wants to scare us.\u201d Long Kui glared at Zhuo Fan.Only Long Jiu spoke in a grave tone, \u201cWhat proof do you have?\u201dZhuo Fan smiled, \u201cNone.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re just running your mouth.\u201d Long Kui threw a despising glare his way.Zhuo Fan laughed, \u201cBut his appearance was that of a bald old man, with Cai Rong and Clan Head Sun calling him Elder Jian!\u201d\u201cCondor Jian Fan?\u201dLong Jiu\u2019s only eye squinted as his power exploded. It was so strong none of the others around him could breathe, stepping back again and again.Only after a while did he calm down.Zhuo Fan gasped as his heart shivered. Long Jiu\u2019s power contained naked killing intent that shocked even him.\u201cGrandpa Jiu, you\u2019ve met that old man?\u201d Zhuo Fan probed.\u201cNot only met him\u2026 That man ruined uncle Jiu\u2019s godeye.\u201d Long Jie explained.Zhuo Fan was in joy. [I was scared you had no grievances. Now that I know you\u2019re archenemies, it couldn\u2019t be better.]\u201cRestrain your anger, grandpa Jiu!\u201d Zhuo Fan switched to a fake compassionate tone.Waving, Long Jiu\u2019s eye glinted with coldness, \u201cAlright, since you spoke of his appearance, I\u2019ll believe you. You can take the courtyard a hundred yards from here.\u201d\u201cThank you, grandpa Jiu!\u201d Zhuo Fan clasped his hands and walked away with Captain Pang. But after a couple of steps, Long Jiu spoke coldly, \u201cKid, where\u2019s that geezer?\u201dStopping, Zhuo Fan replied, \u201cCai clan, but it\u2019s more likely he\u2019s in the Sun clan now.\u201d\u201cI see!\u201d Long Jiu nodded as the bones in his fists crackled. Once Zhuo Fan was out of sight, he spoke, \u201cAh Jie, report it to the clan so they can send some elders. I won\u2019t let Jian Fan leave this place alive. Also, stay for now in that courtyard and look after the Luo clan. I don\u2019t want them to do anything that might scare away Jian Fan.\u201d\u201cUncle Jiu, he is a Hell Valley elder, if he dies here, it will trigger a war between our houses.\u201d Long Jie showed his worry.\u201cHumph, it is he who doesn\u2019t follow the rules and sneaked my domain. If I let him live, I won\u2019t be able to live with the regret of him taking my eye.\u201dSeeing his advice falling on deaf ears, Long Jie sighed and left with Long Kui. Though they left, they could still hear Long Jiu\u2019s angry laughter\u2026The next morning, Zhuo Fan took the siblings and Captain Pang to their new home. This was where the Veiled Dragon Pavilion received their honored guests. It was far larger than the reception house where they were welcomed before. It was the best place in town.In a short while, Luo clan was the talk of the town, of how they were under Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s close care. Everyone knew the Veiled Dragon Pavilion supported them, or they wouldn\u2019t have placed them in one of their courtyards, protected day in day out.Cai clan and Sun clan rejoiced they didn\u2019t accept Elder Jian\u2019s task. Just from today\u2019s circumstances, it was clear that any who dared to harm the Luo clan would face the wrath of Veiled Dragon Pavilion.Just like that, the moment the Luo clan stepped foot in their new home, it was publicly declared as the number one clan in the Windgaze City. They were held above even the Cai clan and Sun clan, despite being a small clan of four.\u201cAre we going to live here from now on?\u201dBeing the first to enter, Luo Yunchang was shocked by the imposing atmosphere of the place, including the sheer number of guards around them, all Qi Condensation experts. Adding to them were two dozen more golden armored guards staying vigilant. They were clearly Bone Tempering experts.Such guards could only be seen in the Seven Noble Houses.Luo Yunhai and Captain Pang ware struck dumb. The later was even in awe by the number of experts, while the former inquisitive.\u201cOld Pang, when the Luo clan recovers, what do you think of becoming the leader of such a team?\u201d Zhuo Fan patted his shoulder.Captain Pang shyly shook his head, \u201cAny guard here is stronger than me. It is great if I can be as strong as them, but I don\u2019t dare lead them.\u201dDespite saying that, his eyes flashed with hope.Zhuo Fan laughed, \u201cThat day will come.\u201dBut a sudden mocking laughter reached them, \u201cMister Zhuo Fan, you not only lie to others but even lie to your own people. A steward like you is only good at conning.\u201dMany turned to see Long Jie and Long Kui walking over.Ever since she realized Zhuo Fan made use of Veiled Dragon Pavilion, she lost all amiable pretense with Zhuo Fan, \u201cWith Captain Pang\u2019s talent, he\u2019d reach the 6th layer Qi Condensation at best. Such a man is but a basic guard to us, not a captain. I advise your little clan not to dream for something out of reach.\u201dLuo Yunchang and Captain Pang saddened while Zhuo Fan steeled his face.\u201cYoung miss Long Kui, as the saying goes, don\u2019t mock a destitute youth. Your words are too harsh.\u201d\u201cHumph, what youth am I mocking? That\u2019s just an excuse to deceive dreamers. Every glorious clan built their way over thousands of years to reach the top. Don\u2019t think you can rely on your wit to stay under Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s protection forever. In my eyes, Windgaze City is but a grain of sand. Even if you\u2019re a king or overlord here, you\u2019d only be a frog in a well, oblivious to the vast world outside\u2026\u201dHearing her incessant babbling, Zhuo Fan laughed.[Oblivious to the vast world? A frog in a well? If anything worked as it should, the glorious Demonic Emperor wouldn\u2019t have fallen from Sacred Domain.] In his eyes it was this Tianyu Empire who was the speck, to say nothing of the Veiled Dragon Pavilion.\u201cZhuo Fan!\u201dSeeing him angry, Luo Yunchang pulled his hand with a frown. They shouldn\u2019t offend their protector.Long Jie also felt Long Kui crossed the line and shook his head after drawing her attention. But the lady only snorted.\u201cYoung miss, lend me some spirit stones.\u201d Zhuo Fan said coldly.Luo Yunchang was startled. She didn\u2019t know what he wanted to do but she gave him a ring containing what he requested.Zhuo Fan jumped on the highest point on the roof and overlooked the area.\u201cHey, this isn\u2019t your home. Get down from there!\u201d Long Kui barked.Ignoring her, Zhuo Fan spoke, \u201c3rd grade, Coiling Dragon Array.\u201dLong Kui and Long Jie were shocked. Zhuo Fan\u2019s words spoke of the array Long Jiu set up in this place yet this kid saw through it with one look.Yet before the shock lessened, Zhuo Fan jumped and spread spirit stones around him from the ring. In fifteen minutes, close to ten thousand spirit stones were buried in the courtyard.When Zhuo Fan landed, Long Kui asked, \u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201dZhuo Fan began making hand signs.In an instant, the ground trembled and dragon roars resounded followed by nine golden dragons bursting out of the ground.The dragons spread across the sky above Windgaze City for all to see.Elder Jian, who was in a hidden room in the Sun clan. He opened his eyes and stared in shock, \u201cWho\u2019s setting up the array? Is it that geezer? No, he doesn\u2019t have the skill to set up one such as this.\u201dIn Veiled Dragon Pavilion, Long Jiu shot to his feet as he watched in astonishment, \u201cIs that my Coiling Dragon Array? No, my array isn\u2019t as strong.\u201dOn Blackwind Mountain, a sinister youth turned to Windgaze City\u2019s direction with a frown, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in the city? Was the plan pushed forward?\u201dBut he soon shook his head, \u201cNo, Elder Jian isn\u2019t impulsive. What could have happened\u2026\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes turned to this strange light. After fifteen minutes, Zhuo Fan\u2019s hand signs changed and the nine golden dragons returned to the earth of the courtyard.It was soon followed by a golden glow that spread all over it.\u201cW-what did you do?\u201d Long Kui stammered.Zhuo Fan ignored her again and showed deep respect as he presented the ring to Luo Yunchang, \u201cYoung miss, I notice the 3rd grade Coiling Dragon Array lacked in strength to safeguard young miss\u2019 safety. As such, I took it upon myself to upgrade it to the 5th grade Nine Heavens Coiling Dragon Array. I have wasted spirit stones, please punish me, young miss.\u201dW-what?!Long Jie and Long Kui were gob-smacked.There were but a handful of people who could set a 5th grade array in the Tianyu Empire. Not even the seven houses had such a talent. But this kid had just simply deployed one.Was he a 5th grade array master?Luo Yunchang knew Zhuo did it on purpose to humiliate them, then deferred to her. This was also the first time she saw him so subdued. It was the perfect moment to install her rightful status as a young miss onto him.Luo Yunchang smiled inside yet her face was stone cold, \u201cSteward Zhuo, I should punish you for taking so many spirit stones without consent. But I won\u2019t blame you as you did it for our sake. Let\u2019s go. \u201cWhat? Punishment? Not even the Seven Noble Houses would dare rebuke such a lofty existence.Long Kui looked as if she had a fly stuck in her throat.Soon, Zhuo Fan accompanied Luo Yunhai as they swaggered inside, to the endless shock of the others and the snickering of Captain Pang and Luo Yunhai.Only Long Jie and Long Kui stood there with their hearts in chaos.They never thought it possible for a scheming 2nd layer Qi Condensation Zhuo Fan to also be a 5th grade array master.How could an unknown clan have such a talent\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His eyes were filled with excitement.\u201cWho set up the array just now?\u201d\u201cUh, it\u2019s\u2026\u201dThe two looked long at each other before Long Jie replied, \u201cLuo clan\u2019s steward, Zhuo Fan!\u201d\u201cWhat, him?\u201dLong Jiu turned to the array and the more he examined it, the more shocked he got, \u201cAn array master needs to know each array as the back of his hand and pours years and years into understanding heaven and earth. At my age, I can only set up 3rd grade arrays, so how can a pup set up a 5th grade array so quickly?\u201dLong Jiu seemed to be asking Long Kui and Long Jie, but it also seemed to be asking himself. The two only shook their heads.It was unknown what kind of man Zhuo Fan was as he kept doing extraordinary and shocking things again and again. Even the two of them, born in a powerful clan, no longer dared to underestimate Zhuo Fan. They even felt inferior.\u201cGo and call the kid over. Uh, no, invite him. I want to speak to him.\u201d Taking a look around, Long Jiu grinned.The two cupped their hands and followed his order. Soon, in a pavilion in the garden behind the courtyard, Long Jiu served tea at a stone table. It didn\u2019t take long before Zhuo Fan came in, followed by Long Jie and Long Kui.\u201cHa-ha-ha, brother Zhuo Fan, sit.\u201d Long Jiu laughed as he invited him.Long Jie and Long Kui were shocked.Brother Zhuo Fan?Long Jiu had a high position in the clan, as such, the two of them called him uncle. Yet a proud man like Long Jiu only respected a handful of people in the Tianyu Empire.But to call this kid \u2018brother\u2019 left the two stumped.Zhuo Fan took it in stride however, sitting without hesitation. In his eyes, this was a world where the strong were respected. With enough strength, even this old man\u2019s grandpa would call him brother.\u201cWhy has bro Jiu called for me?\u201d Zhuo Fan wasn\u2019t a stickler for rules and poured himself some tea. He didn\u2019t seem to know the meaning of shame as he called Long Jiu bro without so much as a blush.Long Kui couldn\u2019t even react. Long Jie rolled his eyes, cursing him for being shameless and taking advantage of circumstances.But Long Jiu was overjoyed. Their relationship was now tighter and that was a good thing for him.\u201cBrother Zhuo Fan, since you called me bro Jiu, I won\u2019t mince words. I\u2019ll be honest with you, brother. For a 5th grade array master to stay in a fallen clan like the Luo clan is a sin. It\u2019s best if you join the Veiled Dragon Pavilion. We will even treat you as a Venerable. Even the Clan Head will have to show you respect.\u201dLong Kui and Long Jie never imagined Long Jiu wanted to invite Zhuo Fan as Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s Venerable.That was the highest status in the Veiled Dragon Pavilion, even higher than an elder. How could a kid, still wet behind his ears, receive such honor?Then again, Zhuo Fan was a 5th grade array master only in the Qi Condensation Stage. Any of the seven houses would invite such a person to be a Venerable.Asking him to join the Veiled Dragon Pavilion was for the clan\u2019s future.Zhuo Fan sipped tea with a smile.He knew of Long Jiu\u2019s intention even before he came. Who wouldn\u2019t fight and seize a 5th grade array master in such an empire? Even the emperor would have to show him courtesy.He foresaw this even as he set up the array.\u201cBrother Zhuo Fan, what do you say?\u201d Long Jiu asked again.Zhuo Fan grinned, \u201cI have one condition.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s in Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s power, you can ask for anything.\u201d Long Jiu expressed his consent.\u201cEven making her serve me tea, rub my feet, and warm my bed?\u201d Zhuo Fan pointed at Long Kui.Long Kui\u2019s cheeks flared red with anger, \u201cKeep dreaming.\u201dLong Jiu had to shake his head in embarrassment, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible with little Kui.\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, it\u2019s just a joke. I already have a young miss so why would I look for another?\u201d Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes were radiant as he turned serious, \u201cI want the Luo siblings\u2026 forever safe.\u201dZhuo Fan paused after each word.Long Jiu showed his admiration. He never expected for Zhuo Fan\u2019s condition to be just this. Such devotion inspired respect from the three around him.Even the always angry Long Kui looked at him longer.\u201cI agree. As long as the Veiled Dragon Pavilion exists, the Luo clan, not only this generation but its descendants will also live in peace.\u201dSmiling, Zhuo Fan sipped his tea again.\u201cThen from now on, you are Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s Venerable. I will report it to the clan and three days later, I will ask Ah Jie to escort you to the clan estate.\u201d\u201cWait!\u201dZhuo Fan raised his hand, \u201cI didn\u2019t agree.\u201d\u201cWhat? But just now\u2026\u201d Long Jiu stood in panic then glared at Zhuo Fan, \u201cBrother Zhuo, were you messing around?\u201dZhuo Fan turned serious, \u201cIf it were 15 minutes ago, I would\u2019ve agreed without hesitation. But now\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat about \u2018now\u2019?\u201d Long Jiu\u2019s beard trembled.Shaking his head, Zhuo Fan let out a mysterious smile as his voice turned cold, \u201cYoung miss Long Kui, do you remember what you said?\u201dZhuo Fan extended his fist, \u201cWithin ten years, I will make the Luo clan stand above the seven houses!\u201dHe down the tea in one gulp and smacked the cup on the table as he left.Long Kui had a strange feeling watching his back.It was impossible for a small clan to rise above the Seven Noble Houses in ten years, even if he was a 5th grade array master. The Seven Noble Houses\u2019 reserves weren\u2019t something he alone could overcome.But Zhuo Fan\u2019s confidence left her without retort.\u201cLittle Kui, what did you say?\u201d Long Jiu turned to the two. From Zhuo Fan\u2019s expression, he knew Zhuo Fan was not lying. So, something must have happened earlier.Long Kui only stared at Zhuo Fan\u2019s back as Long Jie spoke after hesitating.Long Jiu shook his head after hearing the story, \u201cI\u2019ve said already not to insult people and cut at their shortcomings. You\u2019ve insulted the Luo clan and they are sure to not take it lying down.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 what he said can\u2019t be achieved.\u201d Long Jie muttered.Long Jiu stroked his beard, \u201cLuo clan has a 5th grade array master. Even if it won\u2019t rise above the seven houses, it will still be well known in the land. It\u2019s best to get closer to it.\u201cWe were so close to having him as Venerable\u2026\u201d Long Jiu sighed as he fixed his eye on Long Kui.Regarding Zhuo Fan, he went to Luo Yunchang, his mind going a mile a minute.He could have completely put his heart demon to rest but chose not to because of Long Kui\u2019s words.[Pipe dream? If we can\u2019t even dream, our only choice is to leave it up to fate.]Demonic cultivators walked in defiance of heaven, fighting for their own fates. Zhuo Fan thus hated when someone told him that any goals he had was a pipe dream, that he should feel grateful for his fate.He had to prove to everyone that even a fallen clan could reach the top one day. He no longer helped the Luo clan just for the sake of his heart demon, but also for his path as a demonic cultivator.[Nothing in this world is impossible! If Heaven stands in my way, I will kill it. My fate is my own and not Heaven\u2019s.]The day shall come when he would rebuild this ruined clan to the best the world had ever seen! As long as Demonic Emperor Zhuo Yifan was here, nothing was impossible.Bam!Zhuo Fan slammed the door open full of anger.Luo Yunhai, Luo Yunchang, and Captain Pang were startled. Luo Yunchang hesitated before building up the courage to speak to him, \u201cZhuo Fan, what did grandfather Jiu want?\u201d\u201cHe invited me to join Veiled Dragon Pavilion.\u201dThe three\u2019s faces saddened. Despite being downhearted inside, Luo Yunchang strained a smile, \u201cCongratulations, Veiled Dragon Pavilion will offer you a far more glorious future than Luo clan.\u201dShe had a guess Zhuo Fan\u2019s talent as a 5th grade array master would attract the seven houses\u2019 invitation. The Luo clan would find it impossible to hold onto such a man.Zhuo Fan snorted, \u201cWhat are you sad about? I declined.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dShock was seen but happiness was the most obvious emotion, \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cJust because. I\u2019ll be in my room!\u201d Zhuo Fan left without answering. But just before he was gone, he said coldly, \u201cYoung miss, don\u2019t interfere in any future matters of the Luo clan, be it big or small.\u201dLuo Yunchang nodded absentminded. Wasn\u2019t it like this so far? Why did he bring this up?Zhuo Fan then seemed to talk to her but also to himself.\u201cFrom now on, I am Luo clan\u2019s steward. In ten years, I will raise the Luo clan above the Veiled Dragon Pavilion!\u201dHis figure left with the last word, leaving the three in shock\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Not only Long Kui, not even Luo clan\u2019s members saw him.After his bold words that day, Zhuo Fan worked harder on cultivation, locked up in his room. He only let Blood Infant roam free at night to gather Yuan Qi.His target, the Cai clan.As such, Clan Head Cai was dejected all this time. His guards shrank in numbers with each passing day, without so much as a trace left behind. This left him wondering if the Luo clan he offended asked Veiled Dragon Pavilion to deal with his clan.In his opinion, only the Seven Noble Houses had such dreadful power to reap his guards without notice. As such, Cai Rong\u2019s heart grew heavier, to the point his son balled up under his blanket, shivering at night; afraid he would be next.To the living, it wasn\u2019t death that was scary, but the wait before. Father and son felt the crawling of time in the agony of fear.He also thought of seeking Hell Valley\u2019s help. But ever since it got his family martial art, it cut off all ties.This only went to further prolong Cai Rong\u2019s agony as he shouted out his frustration one day in his room. No demonic cultivator was trustworthy, but he was in too deep to turn back now.Zhuo Fan took them all in stride with a sneer.As for the Sun clan, he let the Blood Infant pay them a few visits too. However, Elder Jian was there so, there were many close calls to getting caught. And as of late, many great powers have been present there, so Zhuo Fan avoided entering.He only left Blood Infant to monitor at the gates.On this day, as per usual, the Blood Infant ate a dozen Cai clan guards then staked Cai clan\u2019s gates for a bit before returning to the little courtyard, pleased.Just as he was about to enter his home, a trace of energy caught his eye. Zhuo Fan frowned in his room as the Blood Infant hid its energy. Soon, in a corner across from the little courtyard, a shadow was reflected in his eyes.That person was watching his home.\u201cHumph, no one dares to step inside Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s territory yet this one does? He must be from Blackwind Mountain.\u201d Zhuo Fan grinned.He recalled Elder Jian telling it wasn\u2019t the Cai clan nor the Sun clan who\u2019d come after the Luo clan, but a third party unrelated to them, Blackwind Mountain.If the Luo clan fell, Hell Valley was spared of all liability. But how were a bunch of bandits going to enter the little courtyard?[You think this is the Cloud Manor?]Raising an eyebrow, Zhuo Fan guided the Blood Infant after the person in black. Because Blood Infant\u2019s hidden energy, it wasn\u2019t found out.After taking stock of the surrounding, the bandit left, followed by a red trace.An hour later, the person jumped through a window of a tavern and the Blood Infant floated to peer inside. Zhuo Fan saw seven strong men and a 17-year-old girl to the side. They were all waiting for the person in black to speak.\u201cYoung miss, how\u2019s the situation?\u201d Before the person in black spoke, the girl poured tea and spoke with concern.Zhuo Fan was taken aback, \u201cA woman?\u201dHe never expected the leader of the Blackwind Mountain bandits to be a woman. Were they looking down on the fact that the Luo clan had only four members?Zhuo Fan shook his head.He saw the person in black remove her veil to reveal a pair of bright eyes, black hair flowing down to her waist, with fair and unblemished skin worthy of the title beauty.Even the men couldn\u2019t help but swallow dryly and stare. But the woman\u2019s glare made them lower their heads.\u201cXiao Cui, get me a pen and paper.\u201d Being shouted to, the girl rushed to obey.The beauty drew in detail for fifteen minutes. The contents shocked Zhuo Fan.That was Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s little courtyard in minute detail. He had to admit, making such a map after one night of staking earned a thumbs up from him.She wasn\u2019t the leader for nothing.\u201cLook closely. Here, here, and here are guards. The four corners here have Bone Tempering experts\u2026 \u201c\u201cYoung miss, this is Veiled Dragon Pavilion, how do we proceed? By the look of things, we\u2019ll be dead before we even make it through the door.\u201d One man wiped his sweat from fear.The woman dismissed him. \u201cRelax, senior brother got in contact with Hell Valley\u2019s men and said they will distract the guards. We just need to capture Luo Yunchang and kill the rest.\u201d[What? She isn\u2019t a man, so why capture young miss for?] Zhuo Fan was baffled, but not worried. Even without the guards, he still had the Nine Heavens Coiling Dragon Array.They were ants throwing their lives away.But what caught his attention was that Blackwind Mountain and Hell Valley were connected. They were being exploited just like the Cai clan, but on a much deeper level.\u201cUhm, young miss, there\u2019s something you might not like to hear, but it concerns our lives\u2026\u201d\u201cSay it!\u201d Waving her hand, the girl spoke calmly.The man hesitated before firming his resolve, \u201cYoung miss, the young lord and Hell Valley are connected and will listen to him. Even if Hell Valley\u2019s men help us, the Veiled Dragon Pavilion is still one of the Seven Noble Houses. Offending them will leave us with no place to hide. Will the Hell Valley shelter us then? If they abandon us instead, death will be our only outcome.\u201d\u201cHumph, that\u2019s like saying you\u2019re scared of dying!\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re letting down Mountain Lord with your words? For helping camp lord recover, for his revenge, the least we can do is stake our lives!\u201dHer words brought shame on their faces.She glared at them and shouted, \u201cWithdraw! Follow the predetermined plan without fail.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThey cupped their hands and shouted with respect. When they left, they were resolute with staring death in the face.\u201cNot bad!\u201dZhuo Fan raised an eyebrow as he left the room.Now it was his turn\u2026When all the people left, the girl clapped her hands in glee, \u201cYoung miss is amazing, like a true Mountain Lord.\u201dShaking her head, the woman sighed, \u201cIf godfather was back to health, he\u2019d do it far better. No one on Blackwind Mountain would have doubted him, nor question his orders.\u201d\u201cMaybe, but they still believe in young miss.\u201dThe woman shook her head, \u201cXiao Cui, don\u2019t comfort me. I only hope to cure my adoptive father once we get the Returning Dragon Palm.\u201d\u201cYoung miss will succeed in her filial duty!\u201d The girl giggled.However, it was now that a faint sigh reached them, \u201cGirl, filial and success are different things. Moreover, who told you the Returning Dragon Palm can heal wounds?\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201dThe woman and the girl turned to find Zhuo Fan sitting on the window frame with a smile.\u201cNo need to panic, I have no ill intent. I just came to chat and clear some things up.\u201d Zhuo Fan made a friendly gesture.\u201cWho exactly are you?\u201dThe woman drew Xiao Cui two steps behind her. She didn\u2019t realize Zhuo Fan was spying on them. If he wanted her life, she\u2019d be dead by now.\u201cOh, I haven\u2019t introduced myself.\u201d Zhuo Fan bowed, \u201cI am Luo clan\u2019s steward, Zhuo Fan.\u201d\u201cWhat, the Luo clan?\u201dThe woman\u2019s eyes squinted and gnashed her teeth, \u201cThen die.\u201dShe stabbed with two fingers. Piercing lightning danced between her fingers as if it wanted to shatter the skies.Zhuo Fan was a bit startled, \u201c9th layer of Qi Condensation, spirit ranked martial art?\u201dHe\u2019d never expected for the lass to be so strong and even wield a spirit ranked martial art to boot. Her power was close to a Bone Tempering cultivator.Unfortunately, she met Zhuo Fan. He mocked all those below Bone Tempering.Because he had the Blood Infant!With a hand sign, a red light flashed from his body into the woman.Her body froze yet the lighting still buzzed between her fingers.She was afraid, \u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201dGrinning, Zhuo Fan shook his head, \u201cNothing, I am only controlling your body.\u201dAnd then grabbed her two fingers, \u201cCancel.\u201dIn an instant, the piercing lightning died out.Blood Infant was born of blood and controlled blood. This, in turn, led to the control of the whole body. Only strong cultivation and Yuan Qi could repel such restrictions.But this was because the Blood Infant was still weak. If it was in the Saint Stage, even an Emperor would find it hard to deal with.\u201cCome with me.\u201dZhuo Fan hugged her waist. She could do nothing but let the strange man embrace her as they went.\u201cYoung miss.\u201d Xiao Cui shouted.Zhuo Fan turned and thought of something, \u201cOh, forgot about you.\u201dHis hand grabbed her shoulder and the lass blanked out. Xiao Cui was just a servant that had yet to enter Qi Condensation.Thus, as the first rays of dawn graced the earth, Zhuo Fan walked to his home embracing one girl and one woman\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The guards were taken aback seeing this steward locked up for ten-odd days, only to follow up with a knowing smile.One even teased, \u201cSteward Zhuo, last night must\u2019ve been exhausting for you!\u201dLong Kui happened to pass by and saw him with two beauties. She frowned and rolled her eyes as she walked away with large steps. She ignored him while her mouth kept criticizing, \u201cMen are all the same.\u201dZhuo Fan didn\u2019t care that they misunderstood and threw the two in his room. He closed the door and sat on a chair.\u201cOw!\u201dXiao Cui recovered from hitting the ground and rubbed her eyes, \u201cWhere is this?\u201d But shouted when her eyes landed on the other woman, \u201cYoung miss, are you alright?\u201dThe woman laid motionless on the floor, presenting her delectable assets to Zhuo Fan to see.Smiling, Zhuo Fan moved his finger and she regained her freedom.The woman rose in a flash and reached for her ankle. Her hand now had a dagger that rushed at Zhuo\u2019s neck.Yet, only a groan came as the dagger stopped an inch from his throat as she froze in place.Zhuo Fan admired her with a sneer, \u201cNice skills, but that won\u2019t work on me. I only invited you over to clarify some things. If you are honest, I will let you go.\u201cAlso, it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t bare your fangs at me again.\u201d Zhuo Fan took the dagger from her hand then spared a second glance to her shapely body, \u201cOh, we\u2019d have to make sure you have nothing else hiding on you.\u201dZhuo Fan adopted the frisking posture.The woman turned beet red, \u201cYou dare?\u201dHis hand stopped as Zhuo Fan looked into her eyes, \u201cWhether I dare or not depends on you.\u201dThen his tone turned grave, \u201cWho are you? What are you doing in Windgaze City?\u201dThe woman ignored him.Whoosh!Zhuo Fan ripped a part of her clothing wrapped around her waist and threw it to the ground.\u201cAh!\u201dWith a shriek the woman\u2019s anger exploded. Her eyes seemed to spew fire yet Zhuo Fan couldn\u2019t care less.Xiao Cui rushed over and smacked Zhuo Fan with her tender fists, \u201cBastard, how dare you do that to young miss!\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s other hand moved with ease and some of Xiao Cui\u2019s clothing fell on the floor. She was stunned for a second before shooting back and holding her clothes tighter with tears swelling in her eyes.Zhuo Fan was nonplussed, asking in the same calm voice, \u201cWho are you? What are you doing in Windgaze City?\u201dGnashing her teeth, the woman bit her lips in answer.Her clothing was torn to shreds before as Zhuo Fan repeated with coldness, \u201cWho are you? What are you doing in Windgaze City?\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s cruelty was akin to a heartless machine that brought fear to the woman\u2019s heart. She finally relaxed her clenched jaw, \u201cI am Blackwind Mountain Mountain Lord\u2019s goddaughter, Lei Yuting. I have come to Windgaze City to end the Luo clan.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Zhuo Fan\u2019s face was unfeeling as if it had nothing to do with him. This only worked to stoke Lei Yuting\u2019s fear. This man didn\u2019t look human in her eyes.\u201cHell Valley will distract the guards while we sneak in.\u201dZhuo Fan nodded satisfied. He knew this beforehand and asked this to shred her heart\u2019s defenses.The next question was something he wanted to know the most.\u201cWhat\u2019s your connection with Hell Valley? What do they get by helping you?\u201dLei Yuting was at a loss too, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dZhuo Fan kept his eyes on her, and when he found her answer truthful, \u201cHow are you in contact with Hell Valley? Who mediates?\u201dLei Yuting\u2019s eyes shook but her lips pursed.Zhuo Fan had a guess but he wanted to hear it from her, so he ripped Lei Yuting\u2019s shirt.Her body was exposed to Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes in an instant, leaving only a red lace cloth to protect her final vestige of modesty.Lei Yuting\u2019s tears dropped without a sound. Zhuo Fan\u2019s hand closed in on the red cloth as his voice dropped even lower, \u201cThis is your last chance to maintain your honor. If you don\u2019t answer, there are more than a dozen craving men outside beside me.\u201d\u201cBastard!\u201d Lei Yuting hissed.\u201cI\u2019ll count to three. One, two\u2026\u201d The higher he got the closer his hand was to the red cloth.Lei Yuting\u2019s bit her lips, close to drawing blood while crying, yet no word came out.\u201cYou\u2019re quite brave!\u201d Zhuo Fan nodded and was about to pull when Xiao Cui shouted in panic, \u201cDon\u2019t! I beg you, don\u2019t bully young miss. It\u2019s senior brother Yang who\u2019s in contact with Hell Valley.\u201d\u201cWho is he?\u201d Zhuo Fan\u2019s curled up an evil smile. Lei Yuting wanted to shout for Xiao Cui to stop, but Zhuo Fan\u2019s robbed her voice.Xiao Cui saw young miss suffering and spoke truthfully, \u201cHe is Mountain Lord\u2019s disciple, Yang Ming. The Mountain Lord formed a marriage contract between senior brother Yang and young miss. But one day, Luo\u2019s Clan Head, Luo Zhennan caught him off-guard and wounded him heavily. He lays paralyzed, unable to even speak\u2026\u201d\u201cSo you thought of catching the Luo clan off-guard?\u201d Zhuo Fan grinned, \u201cKillers must pay and revenge must be dealt, right?\u201cAnd then?\u201dXiao Cui hesitated but then she saw Zhuo Fan\u2019s hand drawing near Lei Yuting\u2019s chest, \u201cWe were at a loss in the face of Luo clan\u2019s tight guard, but then senior brother made a pact with Steward Sun. He worked with us from the inside and defeated the Luo clan. Then Luo clan\u2019s young miss ran away and we lost track of her. It was also then when senior brother Yang found out you were all here and asked Hell Valley\u2019s help\u2026\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s hand remained still, \u201cHow did you know Mountain Lord was sneak attacked by Luo Zhennan? Did you see it?\u201d\u201cSenior brother Yang did!\u201d\u201cDid your senior brother Yang also tell you Returning Dragon Palm can heal him?\u201d Zhuo Fan raised an eyebrow as he asked Xiao Cui who nodded. She was amazed he got it right.With a clear picture, Zhuo Fan withdrew his hand from Lei Yuting\u2019s chest.However, a light voice came from outside, \u201cZhuo Fan, are you there?\u201dLuo Yunchang went inside with Luo Yunhai and Captain Pang. The image rooted them in place.An extra two beauties with messed up clothing were inside, with Zhuo Fan\u2019s nefarious hand in front of one\u2019s chest. Luo Yunhai was slack-jawed, yet his eyes roamed like lightning.Covering her brother\u2019s eyes, Luo Yunchang shouted at Captain Pang, \u201cGet young master out.\u201dCaptain Pang nodded as he carried Luo Yunhai outside, but not before he threw Zhuo Fan a vulgar smile any man would understand.\u201cSteward Zhuo!\u201dLuo Yunchang raged, \u201cThis is Veiled Dragon Pavilion. Why are you making trouble?\u201dShrugging, Zhuo Fan said, \u201cEverything I do is for Luo clan\u2019s sake.\u201d\u201cFor Luo clan?\u201dLuo Yunchang laughed from anger, \u201cYou bring two flossies to mess around with and you say it\u2019s for Luo clan? Didn\u2019t you say you were getting stronger? Didn\u2019t you say you\u2019ll raise the Luo clan above the seven houses in ten years? Is this how you do it?\u201dZhuo Fan was stunned. Luo Yunchang carried herself with dignity and virtue at all times, even when angry. Why did she snap today so bad that she lost all composure?Shaking his head, Zhuo Fan said, \u201cIf you knew who they were, you wouldn\u2019t be saying that.\u201dLuo Yunchang was skeptical.\u201cThey are from Blackwind Mountain and I was interrogating them.\u201d Zhuo Fan sneered at the two girls with messed up clothing, \u201cThis method is the most effective against women, even in the case of bandits.\u201d\u201cWhat, they\u2019re from Blackwind Mountain?\u201dLuo Yunchang\u2019s eyes went bloodshot as she used her Yuan Qi to punch Lei Yuting, \u201cGive me back my father.\u201dZhuo Fan caught her soft hand, \u201cCalm down, I believe Blackwind Mountain and the Luo clan\u2019s grievances are connected. The Seven Noble Houses were probably behind it all.\u201dWhat?Not only Luo Yunchang, even Lei Yuting and Xiao Cui were stunned.Both the Luo clan and Blackwind Mountain were mere ants to the Seven Noble Houses. Why go to such lengths to hide their intention when they could deal with them with a snap of their fingers?Zhuo Fan didn\u2019t figure it out yet, but he still let go of Lei Yuting.\u201cYoung miss Lei, I have a presumptuous favor to ask of you.\u201d Zhuo Fan bowed, \u201cI want you to take me to Blackwind Mountain. I want to get to the bottom of this.\u201d\u201cHumph, there\u2019s no way you can enter Blackwind Mountain.\u201d Lei Yuting snorted.Zhuo Fan smiled at Luo Yunchang, \u201cYoung miss, please take out the Returning Dragon Palm.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dLuo Yunchang took it out anyway. If others asked for it, she wouldn\u2019t have been so quick to respond. But since Zhuo Fan was a 5th-grade array master, he wouldn\u2019t covet a mere spirit ranked martial art.Zhuo Fan smiled, \u201cYoung miss Lei, this is the Returning Dragon Palm you wanted. But this is a martial art, it is unable to heal Mountain Lord\u2019s wound. I can only ask for you to take me to Blackwind Mountain to investigate. The chance is Yang Ming had always lied to you. We need to make matters clear, otherwise, Luo clan and Blackwind Mountain will be crushed by the seven houses.\u201d\u201cSenior brother Yang is a good man, not a liar.\u201d Xiao Cui said.Zhuo Fan only looked at Lei Yuting, \u201cHow could Yang Ming make Luo clan\u2019s steward defect after decades under Luo clan and also be in constant contact with Hell Valley? Lei Yuting, do you even know your fianc\u00e9e?\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s words struck a chord inside Lei Yuting and doubt sprouted. Tracing Returning Dragon Palm\u2019s jade slip with her hand, she nodded.Since they gave her the martial art, one passed down through generations, even she found something amiss and agreed. Moreover, Blackwind Mountain was her home and Zhuo Fan was but one man. No trick of his would work there.Zhuo Fan was pleased, but he cleared his voice in embarrassment the next second, \u201cMiss Lei, be careful not to catch a cold.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dOnly now did she react to the vile steward ripping her clothes and could only use her hands for cover.Luo Yunchang and Xiao Cui shoved Zhuo Fan out the door, \u201cScram!\u201dThe door slammed behind him as the three girls exchanged a smile. But then it dawned on them how complicated the matter got. They were still enemies and lost their smiles.Then came Zhuo Fan from outside, \u201cMiss Lei, next time don\u2019t forget to wear more.\u201dLei Yuting was so embarrassed her eyes burned with rage, while her face grew hotter\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The wizen old man had a white goatee, yet his eyes flashed with vigilance now and then.The two arrived at the foot of a mountain and looked to the summit. The beauty eyed the elder but her tone was laced with anger, \u201cZhuo Fan, you better behave. If I find you have any evil intentions towards Blackwind Mountain, I won\u2019t let you off.\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, relax miss. This old man only came to investigate. Moreover, what could a lone man possibly do?\u201d The old man\u2019s laughter reached the heavens above.Snorting, Lei Yuting ignored him, \u201cFurthermore, if you harm even a hair of Xiao Cui, I will end you.\u201d\u201cRelax, I took her hostage because we don\u2019t trust each other. On one hand, I needed some insurance. On the other\u2026\u201d Zhuo Fan spoke in a mysterious voice, \u201cIt is for your own good.\u201d\u201cFor my own good?\u201dLei Yuting didn\u2019t understand, but the only response she got was Zhuo Fan shaking his head.The two climbed in silence. Halfway up, they got to the first checkpoint.\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201dA strong man jumped out in their path. But when he saw Lei Yuting, he bowed, \u201cAh, so it\u2019s Young miss. Weren\u2019t you in Windgaze City, why\u2026\u201d\u201cI had to return!\u201dLei Yuting jutted out her chin, walking without sparing the man a glance.\u201cHe is on Yang Ming\u2019s side.\u201dZhuo Fan whispered, \u201cTell me, if your task in Windgaze City was so secret, why is it that a common bandit knows of it?\u201dLei Yuting frowned.Her previous unshakable trust in Yang Ming was gnawed by Zhuo Fan these past few days. She, herself, started to notice many more inconsistencies in Yang Ming\u2019s behavior. The same could be said about the man they just met. He was watching her every movement, but what she used to take it as normal before, now it felt like a warning.\u201cYou\u2019ll see. Once we arrive, Yang Ming will welcome you.\u201d Zhuo Fan smiled as he sped up. Lei Yuting watched his figure with a heart filled with doubts.They passed several more checkpoints before reaching the summit, they now stood in front of the Blackwind Mountain camp\u2019s gate. Since Zhuo Fan was impersonating an old man and was led by Lei Yuting, no one questioned him.But just as they stepped foot across the gate, a man appeared.He was tall and majestic, just that a wicked smile smeared his handsome face. Zhuo Fan knew in a flash he was Yang Ming.\u201cSee, all your actions were reported back.\u201d Zhuo Fan raised an eyebrow at Lei Yuting, like a child who won the bet.But Lei Yuting didn\u2019t humor him by playing his game, and instead had a solemn face.Zhuo Fan had been feeding her doubts every step of the way, particularly regarding Yang Ming, who might\u2019ve been a spy from the Hell Valley.She didn\u2019t want to believe it since he was the fianc\u00e9e her godfather arranged for her. It was hard for her to change her perception of a man who had the trust of everyone, her godfather included.But these doubts were the fruit of Zhuo Fan\u2019s careful wording along the way.Biting her lip, Lei Yuting saw Yang Ming with a complicated gaze and braced herself for what was to come.\u201cSister Yuting, shouldn\u2019t you be in Windgaze City? Why the sudden return?\u201d Yang Ming approached her with a smile and turned to Zhuo Fan, \u201cAnd this is\u2026\u201dLei Yuting hesitated a moment, \u201cSenior brother, Veiled Dragon Pavilion isn\u2019t someone we can provoke, while Hell Valley\u2019s men aren\u2019t worthy of trust. This operation has too many dangers so I\u2019ve put the men on stand by to observe for now.\u201dYang Ming\u2019s face changed, not much but enough for Zhuo Fan to notice the killing intent in his eyes.\u201cSister Yuting, Master\u2019s kindness is as heavy as a mountain. How can we not give our lives for such a man? How can we be so selfish? Furthermore, aren\u2019t we supposed to avenge Master?\u201d\u201cI am aware, however\u2026\u201d Lei Yuting frowned, \u201cWe cannot disregard the lives of our brothers. This is a 2nd ranked alchemist I have found to save godfather. We will settle this vengeance once he recovers.\u201dSensing his cue, Zhuo Fan cupped his hands, \u201cHa-ha-ha, this old man has wandered the pugilistic world and cured countless illnesses. No injury or disease can escape my trained eye\u2026\u201d\u201cHumph, if you were so great, we\u2019d have known about you. Who are you trying to deceive?\u201dYang Ming interrupted Zhuo Fan bragging, \u201cJunior sister, only Returning Dragon Palm can heal wounds this martial art caused. Don\u2019t you trust me?\u201dLei Yuting recalled the times she spent with Yang Ming and her heart was in chaos.Zhuo Fan stood between the two and asked Yang Ming, \u201cLittle brother, give me a chance. I\u2019m an expert healer.\u201d\u201cGet lost!\u201dYang Ming was furious and sent a palm attack. Zhuo Fan felt the power behind it but didn\u2019t dodge, opting to take the strike with clenched teeth.Bam!Despite not using a martial art, the palm backed up by the power of an early Bone Tempering cultivator struck Zhuo Fan\u2019s chest and sent him sprawling while coughing blood.\u201cWhy did you attack if you refused him entry?\u201d Lei Yuting yelled.Zhuo Fan staggered to his feet after puking another mouthful of blood, \u201cThis old man can\u2019t take too many hits. Miss, I\u2019m sorry but I will have to refuse this deal. I should\u2019ve known no good comes from dealing with bandits.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201dYang Ming was enraged and slapped again, but Lei Yuting stopped him.\u201cI invited him. If you want to hit him, you\u2019ll have to go through me.\u201d\u201cHumph, let him try for all I care. But if this healer makes the Master worse, he won\u2019t leave this place alive.\u201d Yang Ming flung his sleeve and walked out in anger.Lei Yuting felt wronged and glared at Zhuo Fan, \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault senior brother ignores me. I was a fool for believing you. There\u2019s no way my caring senior brother could harm godfather.\u201d\u201cMiss, didn\u2019t your godfather teach you how to judge people?\u201d Zhuo Fan wiped the blood from his mouth with a smile, \u201cBut this is perfect since he bought it.\u201dLei Yuting was shocked, then doubtful.\u201cWhen you talk to someone, you don\u2019t pay attention to what they speak but how they act.\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s grinned evilly, \u201cThe reason he stopped me before was because he didn\u2019t know of my level. Thanks to his palm strike, he gauged my strength was negligible and let me pass. You tell me if he\u2019s caring or not.\u201dLei Yuting replayed the early scene while leaving out Yang Ming\u2019s words. All of his actions went according to Zhuo Fan\u2019s conjecture. To the point that when he left, Yang Ming showed a faint smile to her.[Can it be\u2026]Lei Yuting didn\u2019t dare finish. If she did, her heart would be in too much pain and wouldn\u2019t be able to stop herself from confronting Yang Ming. At that time, the two would break all relations.Zhuo Fan patted her shoulder, \u201cCome, take me to your godfather.\u201d\u201cDamn swindler! It\u2019s fine if you want to act but there\u2019s no point in seeing him.\u201d Lei Yuting could hardly reign her emotions.Zhuo Fan smiled while shrugging nonplussed, \u201cWhen you act, you need to be thorough. Moreover, the act hasn\u2019t reached its climax.\u201dWith the final word, Zhuo Fan walked forward and Lei Yuting followed.As they passed, hundreds of eyes focused on them.Lei Yuting felt uneasy from so many stares. What used to be eyes filled with respect, now held only wariness.The two entered the Mountain Lord\u2019s room and saw Yang Ming inside. He held a bowl of gruel, feeding the old man on the bed.\u201cHack, I will hold you responsible for anything that happens to Master.\u201dYang Ming smacked the bowl on the table and glared, then took a seat to the side to observe.Zhuo Fan laughed inside as he inspected the patient.When his fingers touched the old man\u2019s wrist, he injected his Yuan Qi and what he saw stunned him. It was all clear to him now.\u201cHe has no external wounds.\u201d Zhuo Fan shook his head.Yang Ming rolled his eyes and snorted, \u201cIs there a need to even say it?\u201d\u201cBut neither\u2026 internal ones.\u201dYang Ming\u2019s eyes squinted and his hands tightened.He judged the 4th layer Qi Condensation Zhuo Fan as having no skill to speak of, but reality proved him wrong.Yang Ming\u2019s killing intent spiked!\u201cIf godfather isn\u2019t injured, why can\u2019t he move or speak?\u201d Lei Yuting doubted Zhuo Fan\u2019s diagnosis, thinking he was just putting on a show.

Lei Yuting was stunned.\u201cSenior brother, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dSquinting his eyes, Yang Ming turned to Lei Yuting, \u201cJunior sister, are you hiding something from me?\u201dLei Yuting froze but shook her head after hesitating, \u201cHow can I?\u201dYang Ming snickered, \u201cJunior sister, after being in contact for so long, you\u2019re unable to lie to me.\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201dLei Yuting felt danger behind Yang Ming\u2019s smile. As if a viper had its eyes on her, forcing her to stagger back.Yang Ming flashed with determination, \u201cJunior sister, where is Xiao Cui?\u201d\u201cI had her do some things.\u201d Lei Yuting stammered.Yang Ming nodded, pleased. But the next second, his eyes flashed evilly as he sent a palm strike. The powerful strike to her chest sent Lei Yuting flying.A trail of blood hung in the air.Yang Ming then pressed a spot on the bed and a trap door opened beneath Lei Yuting.Zhuo Fan faked shock and fled. But Yang Ming\u2019s quick hand clutched his neck throwing him inside the hole and then closed the trap door.The old man trembled from fury seeing the two falling in Yang Ming\u2019s trap.Bam!Lei Yuting\u2019s body ached as she landed in the black cave. But then, with a loud bang, something crashed onto her with such force that she spat blood.\u201cDidn\u2019t think this kid would have a trap door.\u201d Zhuo Fan reached for the ground and felt something soft in his palm, \u201cWhy is the ground so soft?\u201d\u201cAh, bastard! Get off me!\u201dA shriek pierced his ears and Zhuo Fan realized he was on top of Lei Yuting with his two hands conveniently placed on her chest.He rushed away and said embarrassed, \u201cSorry, it was a total accident\u2026\u201dLei Yuting, with a beet-red face, didn\u2019t argue.She stood up and raved, \u201cYang Ming, so you\u2019re the one behind it all!\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha\u2026\u201dYang Ming\u2019s egotistical laughter came from above, \u201cJunior sister, I knew your return was suspicious. And you even brought a 2nd-grade alchemist. You started to doubt me.\u201d\u201cWhy are you doing this? Godfather always treated you well.\u201d Lei Yuting wailed in grief as her heart broke.Yang Ming replied with a sneer, \u201cI have my own plans, this old man means nothing to me. I didn\u2019t hope to deal with you so soon, but you even went as far as bringing a 2nd-grade alchemist to ruin my plan.\u201d\u201cWhat, do I mean so little to you?\u201dTears streamed Lei Yuting\u2019s cheeks. She spat blood again from heartache.Zhuo Fan shook his head, unmoved by her plight. [You only have yourself to blame.] But since he had a play to finish, he still kept true to his role as a healer.\u201cLittle brother, I have nothing to do with your problems. Let me go, I\u2019m innocent.\u201dYang Ming only laughed.\u201cDamn hack, if you were useless it wouldn\u2019t have made much difference if I killed you or not. Such a shame you figured out the old man\u2019s illness.\u201d\u201cIllness? What illness? I only thought he didn\u2019t move for so long that toxins started to set in and wanted to give him a laxative!\u201d Zhuo Fan cried his injustice, \u201cThis is how I earn my meager living, why\u2026 \u201cYang Ming rubbed his forehead.[Curses, it\u2019s all a misunderstanding!]He took the old man as having skills when he was nothing but a swindler looking to earn his next meal. [In the end, what skill can a 4th layer Qi Condensation old man have?]Yang Ming shook his head, regretting his rash actions. He wanted Lei Yuting to complete his job, but now he had to do it himself.\u201cDamn hack! You ruined everything!\u201d Yang Ming roared, \u201cOnce I come back, I\u2019ll deal with you both!\u201d\u201cGuards, make sure no one comes in.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dZhuo Fan then heard two guards taking positions at the door and Yang Ming leaving.\u201cHey, little brother, I\u2019m not the only one who makes a living like this! Hey, let me go, I\u2019m innocent\u2026\u201dZhuo Fan shouted a few more times but didn\u2019t get a reply and was certain Yang Ming was gone.He turned to Lei Yuting to find her sitting blankly. She just found out her fianc\u00e9e was someone else entirely and felt nothing for her, willing to even kill her. Any girl would feel their heart torn to shreds from this.Rubbing his fake beard, Zhuo Fan spoke, \u201cYou\u2019re not too different from my Young miss. You should later share each other\u2019s pain and learn from them.\u201d\u201cHumph, later? It\u2019s still unclear if we\u2019ll survive.\u201d Lei Yuting lashed.Zhuo Fan\u2019s smile brimmed with confidence, \u201cIt\u2019s all going according to this old man\u2019s plan. Relax, we\u2019re leaving tonight. But if you want to die, you can take your life now of course. After all, you\u2019ve been discarded.\u201dLei Yuting snapped, \u201cIf I die, I\u2019ll drag you down with me.\u201dZhuo Fan chuckled as he closed his eyes, waiting for the night.Lei Yuting pouted, yet she found bickering with Zhuo Fan had eased the pain inside and that something faint sprouted\u2026In the dead of night, a crescent moon hung in the clouded sky above Blackwind Mountain. Most bandits were asleep, with the exception of the guards.In the dark cave, Zhuo Fan neared the wall and flashed his eyes open as Lei Yuting was sleeping further behind.He pointed and a red light flashed from Lei Yuting\u2019s body and floated before Zhuo Fan.The Blood Infant.Zhuo Fan didn\u2019t trust Lei Yuting even with an agreement in place. So he took Xiao Cui hostage and placed the Blood Infant inside her.If she made one wrong move, he\u2019d end her in an instant.It was fortunate Lei Yuting\u2019s act was in order, but now it was time for Blood Infant to show its strength.The Blood Infant was acting as if it hadn\u2019t seen its parent for days, rubbing Zhuo Fan\u2019s cheek. He smiled for a moment before his eyes flashed with mad killing intent.Blood Infant knew his heart desires and flew outside. The thick stone walls didn\u2019t hinder it in the least.The mountain forest was particularly quiet at this time and the bandits were enjoying their dreams in their rooms.But a red light flashed inside one of them, only to leave the next second to enter another bandit. The previous content smile faltered and was soon devoid of life.The Blood Infant\u2019s speed was dreadful, cleaning up a room of twenty bandits in one breath. When it left, the room was robbed of life.In the same manner, the Blood Infant travelled all over Blackwind Mountain, taking every breath of life along the way. Its final stop was the two guards at Mountain Lord\u2019s door.Whoosh!One guard saw his partner being assaulted by a red light, \u201cSomething went inside you!\u201dThe other guard froze, not getting what happened, but then Zhuo Fan\u2019s voice came from within his body, \u201cLet us out.\u201dThe guards\u2019 hearts were in a panic. Why did the voice of the one trapped beneath them come from one guard\u2019s body?Before they could understand what happened, the Blood Infant dried up its host before the other one\u2019s eyes, leaving nothing but dust. It then entered the other guard.The guard was scared to death to the point he lost his voice.It was then Zhuo Fan\u2019s voice came from inside him, \u201cLet us out!\u201dIt carried with it an undeniable power that softened the guard\u2019s knees as he relieved himself in his pants.\u201cLord, please wait, I\u2019ll do it right now.\u201d The guard cried.Anyone who had seen their partner turn to dust would have no shred of courage left. The guard rushed in tears to open the mechanism.Rumble!The trapdoor opened and light shined inside.Lei Yuting was roused by the sudden light and looked to see Zhuo Fan next to her, \u201cIf you want to live, come with me.\u201dThen he jumped.Lei Yuting was amazed at how he did it, but his words made her angry, \u201cHumph, I won\u2019t die so easily.\u201dShe then jumped after him\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Young-, no, Yang Ming that bastard forced me\u2026\u201dLei Yuting was clueless as Zhuo Fan waved, \u201cStand aside.\u201dThe guard curled up in a corner.Then Zhuo Fan walked to the old man\u2019s bed. Zhuo Fan smiled at the naked killing intent in the old man\u2019s eyes, \u201cI can heal you, but you have to listen to me afterwards.\u201dLei Yuting was moved, \u201cYou can heal godfather?\u201dZhuo Fan only stared at the old man in the eye.The old man hesitated but Zhuo Fan dispelled it with a smile, \u201cRelax, I won\u2019t do anything that might jeopardize your clan. I am Zhuo Fan, Luo clan\u2019s steward. We have a common enemy and I am missing a Bone Tempering expert that I hope you can fill in for.\u201dHis words worked to intensify the glare in the old man\u2019s eyes.Zhuo Fan grinned, knowing he agreed, with a wave of his finger the Blood Infant left the guard and floated in front of Zhuo Fan.At the sight of the bloody light, the guard shivered. This was the one behind his partner\u2019s gruesome death.Lei Yuting was shocked, having also suffered at the hands of this light, \u201cZhuo Fan, what are you trying to do?\u201d\u201cHeal him.\u201d Zhuo Fan flitted his eyes over her.\u201cCan\u2026 this thing heal?\u201d Lei Yuting was doubtful, having seen Zhuo Fan using it to attack and humiliate her before.[What if this thing worsens godfather\u2019s illness?]Zhuo Fan sneered, \u201cYoung miss, your godfather agreed already. I have no reason to hurt him.\u201d\u201cThen what is that thing?\u201d Lei Yuting watched the old man with worry.\u201cDemonic creature!\u201dZhuo Fan explained coldly, \u201cUs, demonic cultivators, refine demonic creatures. Be it for attacking or defending, these creatures are essential. Do you know why Yang Ming snapped when I said the old man had a foreign object inside?\u201dLei Yuting shook her head, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say it was a blind guess?\u201dZhuo Fan almost spat blood, \u201cNow I know why he fooled you. You\u2019re a blockhead. Did you also believe me when I was fooling him? I see now why he left so at ease, even while you are alive.\u201dLei Yuting blushed and lowered her head.Godfather always told her she had a talent for cultivation, a genius. But Zhuo Fan was the first to call her blockhead.\u201cThe reason why he flipped was because my words hit him where it hurts.\u201d Zhuo Fan spoke gravely, \u201cAs for why the old man is immobilized, it\u2019s because of a demonic creature! I will now use mine to expel the one inside him.\u201dEven so, Lei Yuting was still worried, \u201cYour demonic creature can expel his?\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha\u2026\u201dZhuo Fan laughed as he heard the biggest joke in his life.Based on his early diagnosis, Yang Ming\u2019s demonic creature was refined from a parasitic worm, the lowest among demonic creatures. But his was the Blood Infant, feared by even the ten Emperors of old. How could they ever be equal?[Sigh, ignorance is terrifying!]Zhuo Fan no longer wasted words on Lei Yuting and waved his finger so that the Blood Infant entered the old man.A flash of red passed and the old man\u2019s skin crawled. As it started to wiggle, a light flashed over that spot.Wherever the light went, the wiggling stopped.After a few dozen breaths, the Blood Infant returned to Zhuo Fan\u2019s body while the old man began to move his finger. His lips parted to let a faint whisper, \u201cTing\u2019er\u2026\u201d\u201cGodfather!\u201dLei Yuting grabbed his hand as tears fell. But Zhuo Fan frowned and muttered, \u201cDamn it. This old man won\u2019t move anytime soon, his blood vessels atrophied. He needs at least half a year to recover; I helped him for nothing.\u201dEven with his low voice, Lei Yuting picked up his every word.Lei Yuting glared at him, \u201cMake no mistake, my godfather owes you and I will do everything to repay it. You won\u2019t lose out.\u201dHe shrugged. He wanted a Bone Tempering expert, not a run of the mill cultivator stuck at the cusp of entering Bone Tempering Stage that he could easily deal with.It was at this time the old man\u2019s body trembled and an inch-long snow-white worm crawled out of his mouth.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dLei Yuting shrieked. But when she saw the worm, her anger got the best of her.\u201cSo you\u2019re the cause of my godfather\u2019s illness!\u201d Lei Yuting poured all her power into the lightning between her two fingers and stabbed at the worm.\u201cStop!\u201dZhuo Fan grabbed her hand. Lei Yuting saw his eyes flash with an odd light.\u201cWhat are you doing? We need to kill this parasite!\u201d\u201cYou know nothing!\u201dZhuo Fan looked for a box to put the worm carefully. Before closing the lid, he dropped a few drops of blood essence and smiled with satisfaction as he hid it in his chest.Never did he expect to earn so much on this trip.This creature was called Frigid Pool Snow Worm, one that lived in the coldest waters and was very rare. It was a parasite that would die if the larva didn\u2019t find a host in two hours after hatching.But the cold pool it lived in hardly had any living beings and most of the worms would die soon after being born.A demonic cultivator would raise it into an inferior demonic creature since most poisonous worms or insects could be turned into parasites. This was why many demonic cultivators considered the Frigid Pool Snow Worm a mere parasite, albeit a rarer one.Yet even in the Sacred Domain, one would be hard-pressed to find someone who knew of Frigid Pool Snow Worm\u2019s fatal flaw. It would only leave its host when it was on the brink of death.Just now, the Blood Infant used the Demon Transformation Art to kill its larva and make it believe its life was threatened so it would come out willingly. Another way was to kill the old man.By destroying all its larva, the worm had now become a common parasite.However, a treasure such as this could be refined into an unprecedented demonic creature in Zhuo Fan\u2019s hands.He started to let out an evil smile. His grin only made the other three\u2019s hearts shudder, thinking Zhuo Fan was worse than Yang Ming.\u201cCarry him, we\u2019re returning to Windgaze City.\u201dZhuo Fan then turned to the remaining guard with a kind smile, \u201cThank you for opening the door for us.\u201dWith a strained nod, the guard squeezed a smile.Then a steel grip lifted him by the throat, \u201cBut now, you\u2019re expendable.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dLei Yuting was late in stopping him. Black energy burrowed into the guard and he soon blew up in a cloud of dust.She froze seeing Zhuo Fan kill a man for the first time.He was so ruthless, he didn\u2019t even leave a corpse. Lei Yuting recalled how she spent the last few days next to such a murderer and fear swelled inside her.Even the old man\u2019s eyes squinted. He was a seasoned cultivator yet also felt his courage falter from Zhuo Fan\u2019s act.Lei Yuting looked at her godfather with a heavy heart, unsure if joining Zhuo Fan was a good choice. But one thing was certain, she should never ever make an enemy out of him!Sighing, she resigned in carrying her godfather behind Zhuo Fan.Bodies were strewn everywhere they looked around the camp. Each man had a peaceful death, but it was this calm expression that struck the greatest fear in the two\u2019s hearts.The mountain camp had around four hundred men, yet they all died without a sound, including those who weren\u2019t corrupted by Yang Ming.The old man had tears streaming down his cheeks when he recalled drinking with his brothers.But far from hating Zhuo Fan, he was more grateful. He was the lord of Blackwind Mountain and knew decisiveness was needed here. Once word got out about his rescue, not only the ones here but also the ones living in Windgaze City would find themselves dead.If Zhuo Fan didn\u2019t do it, the old man would\u2019ve asked him to.He was grateful that Zhuo Fan spared him from giving out the kill order.\u201cSteward\u2026 Zhuo, thank\u2026 you.\u201d His strained words shocked Lei Yuting, while Zhuo Fan understood.The old man was both in admiration and fearful as he watched the bodies.\u201cYou\u2026 did a great deed\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She ran in tears to Lei Yuting, \u201cYoung miss.\u201dLei Yuting wiped the girl\u2019s tears and bopped her nose, \u201cSilly girl, they weren\u2019t hard on you, were they?\u201dXiao Cui shook her head, \u201cAll Luo clan, besides that evil steward, treated me with kindness.\u201d\u201cAhem, girly, don\u2019t talk bad about people when they\u2019re present or they will put you in your place.\u201dZhuo Fan then walked next to the rest of the Luo clan\u2019s members who smiled at Xiao Cui\u2019s antics.Luo Yunhai approved, \u201cYou dumb girl, bro Zhuo likes to spank people the most. You messed with him, now see how he messes up your rear.\u201dXiao Cui hid behind Lei Yuting.Zhuo Fan rolled his eyes. Was he a fiend in these kids\u2019 eyes? Luo Yunchang and Captain Pang exchanged a glance but felt warm inside.Zhuo Fan always did what he wanted and never left a good first impression, to the point some might even call him vile. They experienced this first hand. But once they got to know Zhuo Fan, they would discover that he was a trustworthy person.\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 Yunchang?\u201dThey all turned to the old man behind Lei Yuting who watched Luo Yunchang with emotion. Then he turned to the child, \u201cAnd you are\u2026 Luo Yunhai?\u201d\u201cGods be praised, brother Zhennan\u2019s children are alive!\u201d\u201cSenior, are you perhaps\u2026\u201d Luo Yunchang hesitated.The first thing Zhuo Fan did when he returned was to bring her to Blackwind Mountain\u2019s lord to understand the relationship between Blackwind Mountain and Luo clan, and why Hell Valley set its sights on them.Zhuo Fan made the introductions, \u201cThis is Blackwind Mountain\u2019s lord, the leader of the bandits who destroyed Cloud Manor.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dLuo Yunchang\u2019s face turned gloomy and dignified as killing intent surged and her Yuan Qi leaked.Lei Yuting jumped in front of the old man.His frail hand moved Lei Yuting aside and dropped to his knees, tears flowing freely, \u201cYunchang, Luo clan\u2019s disaster is all my fault. If you want to kill anyone, kill me.\u201d\u201cGodfather!\u201d\u201cMountain Lord!\u201dLei Yuting and Xiao Cui shouted but the old man dismissed them, \u201cI owe it to the Luo clan. You are not to stop her.\u201dLuo Yunchang watched the weak old man with anger, yet she didn\u2019t strike.Zhuo Fan patted her shoulder, \u201cYang Ming had him fooled for so long, immobilized him in his bed, and he had only recently recovered somewhat. The attack on the Luo clan had nothing to do with him.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so earlier?\u201d Luo Yunchang grumbled, blaming him for almost having killed an innocent.Zhuo Fan rubbed his chin, \u201cAlthough, this old man is so blind that taking him in might sink the Luo clan. Killing him for revenge is only natural.\u201dShe rolled her eyes at Zhuo Fan\u2019s dubious logic.Despite making some sense, blaming the old man was going too far. Luo Yunchang wasn\u2019t a person who took her anger on others. Even more so when the old man seemed to have known her father well.\u201cSenior, you\u2019re also a victim.\u201d\u201cNo, I and Zhennan are sworn brothers but the Luo clan fell because of me. It is because of me his soul can\u2019t rest.\u201d He wiped the tears from his pain-stricken face.Luo Yunchang was shocked and then saw Luo Yunhai shaking his head, \u201cSenior, why is it that father never mentioned you?\u201dReleasing the breath that he was holding, the old man calmed his restless heart, \u201cLuo clan is a distinguished clan, leagues above an old bandit such as I. But your father and I became sworn brothers right as we met and kept it hidden, afraid of affecting the Luo clan\u2019s reputation. Furthermore, my Lei clan has an ancient rule, never to make enemies of Cai and Luo clans.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dLuo Yunhai cried out then muttered, \u201cDad once told me that regardless of the situation, to always survive or perish alongside Lei and Cai clans. I know of the Cai clan, but is the Lei clan he was referring to, yours?\u201dLuo Yunchang turned to her brother, \u201cHow come father never told me anything about this?\u201dLuo Yunhai stuck out his chin and snickered, \u201cDad said it\u2019s a secret between men. It is not for women or outsiders to know of.\u201dZhuo Fan frowned, \u201cIs it possible that this ancestral rule in the Lei and Luo clans is passed down to the Clan Head only?\u201d\u201cCorrect, but as I do not have a son to pass it on, I speak of it now. Moreover, I and Zhennan became brothers, so the Luo clan would never harm us.\u201dBut then he recalled how Luo clan fell because of him and shook his head in shame.\u201cOld man, do you have a martial art passed down in your clan?\u201d Zhuo Fan asked.The old man nodded, \u201cI passed down my clan\u2019s spirit ranked martial art, Lightning Finger, to Ting\u2019er as I have no son. But that bastard Yang Ming took the jade slip instead.\u201dBam!Zhuo Fan clapped, \u201cThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s what they are after.\u201dThen he rushed out the door, \u201cWait here.\u201dEveryone was stunned, clueless as to what he wanted to do\u2026Zhuo Fan passed like a storm through Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s gates guarded by the same pair of guards, they didn\u2019t even try to stop him.\u201cBro Jiu!\u201d Zhuo Fan shouted as he searched for Long Jiu.He soon saw a closed door with Long Kui and Long Jie acting as guards and knew Long Jiu was inside. He rushed over as he shouted.Long Kui blocked him, enraged, \u201cShut up! Uncle Jiu won\u2019t receive guests today. Get lost!\u201d\u201cHumph, I\u2019m not a guest. I have important matters to discuss with Long Jiu. Stand aside.\u201d Zhuo Fan wanted to charge in but Long Jie and Long Kui\u2019s power barred him entry.\u201cImportant is it? Don\u2019t mistake Uncle Jiu\u2019s appreciation of you for weakness! This is Veiled Dragon Pavilion, not your backyard.\u201d Long Kui glared at him as she stood her ground before the door.\u201cBrother Zhuo, Uncle Jiu can\u2019t see you today. Please go back.\u201d Long Jie was firm.Zhuo Fan knew charging in was pointless and smiled, \u201cGirly, do you know where I\u2019ve been these past few days?\u201d\u201cHumph, where could a filthy man possibly go? Last time you had two in your arms and this time you must have spent a tender night out in their village.\u201d Long Kui rolled her eyes.Zhuo Fan shook his head with a sneer, \u201cHa-ha-ha, I wish, but I\u2019m not as free as Young miss Long. Back to the matter at hand, I followed a lead on Hell Valley. Any time now they will come to Veiled Dragon Pavilion, so don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you!\u201d\u201cHumph, nonsense. If you know Hell Valley\u2019s actions, then bulls can fly.\u201d Long Kui disdained.Zhuo Fan shook his head and left, shouting his final warning, \u201cTell Uncle Jiu I am taking the Luo clan into hiding, so we won\u2019t get dragged in Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s fall.\u201dLong Kui wanted to curse, [We\u2019ve always treated you so well yet you even curse us after breaking all ties?]She didn\u2019t get the chance however, as the door opened with a creak and Long Jiu\u2019s voice came, \u201cPlease bring brother Zhuo in!\u201dLong Jie and Long Kui were shocked, then bowed, \u201cYes!\u201dZhuo Fan flitted past them like smoke, \u201cNo need, I can do it myself, he-he-he\u2026\u201dLong Kui panted with rage when she saw his smug look, \u201cWhat\u2019s so great about him? Isn\u2019t he just a 5th-grade array master? Why does Uncle Jiu care so much about him?\u201dWith a bitter smile, Long Jie returned to guarding the door.[This is a prime example of hating grapes from being sour without trying them. If Young miss was a 5th-grade array master instead, not only Uncle Jiu would\u2019ve cared for you, he\u2019d even praise you to high heaven\u2026]On the other hand, Zhuo Fan, who couldn\u2019t care less about Long Kui\u2019s increasing discontent of him, walked inside a huge house after spending five minutes crossing a corridor.He soon saw Long Jiu sitting on a high chair beaming at him. On either side of him were another two identical seats, with the exception that they were facing in the opposite direction.\u201cHa-ha-ha, brother Zhuo, what brought you here today?\u201dZhuo Fan stopped before Long Jiu who was smiling at him, but that smile was soon replaced by a grim look, \u201cBut I must remind you, if you came here with nonsense, there will be consequences.\u201dScratching his nose, Zhuo Fan smiled, \u201cHell Valley\u2019s experts are here and will soon attack this place. I wonder if this is considered nonsense.\u201d\u201cOf course not, if it\u2019s true!\u201dBefore Long Jiu responded, an aged voice came from one high chair, followed by the slow turning of both the chairs. Two ferocious auras, stronger than Long Jiu, swept Zhuo Fan.His breath caught in his throat and staggered backwards as a drop of cold sweat trailed down his shocked face\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His eyes flashed golden like a piercing sword, enough to cut one\u2019s heart.The second elder had red hair and took long breaths. Each exhale warped the air as if he breathed fire.One look was enough for Zhuo Fan to know they were stronger than Long Jiu. One of them even trained the Golden Body to completion while the other cultivated a fire cultivation method to great success.In the short time Zhuo Fan was exposed to their power, he knew the old men weren\u2019t far from the Radiant Stage. In the mortal domain, any who reached this stage was among the few strongest on the continent.[So this is the power of the Veiled Dragon Pavilion.] Zhuo Fan sighed inside.The blond elder glanced at Zhuo Fan, \u201cAre you that Zhuo Fan old Jiu couldn\u2019t stop praising?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cI heard you\u2019re a 5th-grade array master.\u201dZhuo Fan nodded. Before grasping the two\u2019s character, he refrained from acting casually, \u201cJunior has a trivial understanding of 5th-grade arrays, but nothing seniors could consider as worth.\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, a 5th-grade array master is a Venerable in the Veiled Dragon Pavilion. And we two are just Elders. Even we have to show you respect.\u201d The blond elder let out a friendly laugh, unfitting of his stiff expression.The red-haired elder\u2019s rough voice boomed, \u201cHey kid, old Jiu said you\u2019re quite arrogant, that you can raise an unknown clan above the seven houses in ten years. Listening to you shout bro Jiu sure is arrogant enough. How come you\u2019re so shy when facing us two?\u201dZhuo Fan smiled, \u201cI have met with bro Jiu many times and got to know his limits. But this is my first time meeting the two of you.\u201dThe elders were surprised.Long Jiu\u2019s face twitched and snapped, \u201cKid, you say you saw through me, is that it? And here I thought you were bossy to anyone you met when in fact you acted like this only around me. You think this old man is all washed up?\u201d\u201cHe-he-he, of course not. I consider bro Jiu my friend, and with how a broad-minded senior you are, you would never lower yourself to my level. If I were to act the same with a one-track minded person, I\u2019d be dead.\u201dZhuo Fan shook his head and continued, \u201cThat is no longer arrogance, but idiocy.\u201dThe three smiled inside. The blond and the red-haired elders even showed approval.[Just as old Jiu said, this kid can see through others while also handling each of them with flawless flattery. His words might irritate old Jiu but as a senior, he won\u2019t bicker with a junior.]\u201cI like this kid, ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201d The red-haired elder laughed, while the blond elder nodded, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know you have no intention to join Veiled Dragon Pavilion, I would\u2019ve insisted on having you join us, ha-ha-ha\u2026 \u201cZhuo Fan might be cupping his hands with a smile, but a sneer laid in his heart.In the off chance this glorious and fallen Demonic Emperor couldn\u2019t rise again, he would still not join a party that didn\u2019t even have a Radiant Stage cultivator. [Quite the opposite, in fact. If you old fogies are stuck in cultivation, this old man will give you pointers.]\u201cOh, you were saying just now that Hell Valley\u2019s men are here. Are you certain?\u201dThe blond old man\u2019s face turned solemn as they went down to important matters. Long Jiu turned his eye over to him, eager to know.Zhuo Fan nodded, \u201cHalf a month ago, I discovered the Sun clan had two more incredibly strong auras besides Elder Jian. As I was out with work these past days, I hadn\u2019t kept an eye on Sun clan and am unclear if more had come.\u201d\u201cHumph, the more the better! I will kill them regardless!\u201d Long Jiu slapped the table as his eye turned bloodthirsty.\u201cOld Jiu, don\u2019t let anger cloud your judgment!\u201d The blond old man frowned and said to Zhuo Fan, \u201cLittle brother, how do you know?\u201d\u201cA cat has its way, and so does a mouse. The less you know, the better.\u201d Zhuo Fan shook his head.The blond old man was doubtful, while Long Jiu was convinced, \u201cThird brother, brother Zhuo\u2019s news is reliable. When that bastard Jian Fan came to Windgaze City, our spy network didn\u2019t pick it up and we only knew it thanks to brother Zhuo\u2019s warning. I can attest to that, as I checked its validity myself.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dThe blond elder frowned and said surprised, \u201cLittle brother, you\u2019re quite amazing. I wonder who your Master is\u2026\u201d\u201cOverlord Nine Serenities!\u201d Zhuo Fan blurted.They were stunned.This name was domineering to the extreme, but when did this continent have such a persona?Zhuo Fan smiled to himself. In the Sacred Domain, it would hint to the Nine Serenities Emperor\u2019s location, but in the mortal domain, no one was the wiser.After all, the folk here were too far away, enough to keep such ancient rumors from reaching their ears.\u201cUh, your Master must be a hidden expert to train brother Zhuo to 5th-grade array master.\u201d The blond elder didn\u2019t press for more.\u201cBrother Jiu, do you have a Recovery Pill?\u201d Zhuo Fan popped a question.Long Jiu nodded as he took out a bottle, \u201cIs someone from Luo clan hurt?\u201dA Recovery Pill was a 3rd-grade pill, not too expensive and neither too common, valued a hundred thousand spirit stones at the minimum. But since Zhuo Fan wanted it, Long Jiu was bound to acquiesce.What could this pill be worth when the two were close as bros and there was even a 10 million debt binding them?Zhuo Fan took the pill then cupped his hands, \u201cThank you, bro Jiu and elders. I will be going now.\u201d\u201cDamn punk, this was your aim all along.\u201d Long Jiu cursed, \u201cYou disturbed us for some meager pill, so now you must suffer my punishment.\u201dZhuo Fan laughed as he dismissed him, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you something else then. Hell Valley will attack in two days. Better bump up security.\u201dThen he walked out laughing.Long Jie and Long Kui saw the immensely pleased Zhuo Fan come out and knew he had a delightful conversation, which only worked to sour the two\u2019s hearts.The fact that a kid like him had more right than them to join a meeting of elders left them annoyed, Long Kui in particular.The blond elder stroked his beard, keeping Zhuo Fan\u2019s figure in his eyes, \u201cBrothers, this kid puts on a smart appearance, while each word he spoke was carefully considered. So young yet so skilled. I can\u2019t help but wonder whose disciple he is. Veiled Dragon Pavilion will have to get in touch with his master.\u201dThe two nodded.On the other hand, Zhuo Fan went straight home. Along the way, he even spotted quite a few suspicious individuals prowling around.A great fight was about to erupt.He soon returned to Luo Yunchang.Thanks to the old man\u2019s briefings, Luo Yunchang was now privy to the ups and downs of past events and was beginning to sympathize and relate with them.Since both of them have suffered at the hands of a common enemy, their alliance became more solid.Zhuo Fan relaxed seeing this and threw a bottle at the Mountain Lord, \u201cTake this. I hope you\u2019ll be up to your peak in no time.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Lei Yuting asked.\u201cRecovery Pill!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Lei Yuting was stunned.She knew of its value. Even if Blackwind Mountain robbed for a whole year, they\u2019d still be unable to gather the spirit stones to pay for it. Yet he threw such a precious pill just like that.Was Luo clan that rich?Seeing through her, Luo Yunchang patted Lei Yuting\u2019s hand, \u201cSister Yuting, be at ease. Veiled Dragon Pavilion owes us 10 million. A 3rd-grade pill is nothing!\u201dLei Yuting\u2019s shock left her slack-jawed.No wonder Veiled Dragon Pavilion was protecting them free of charge.[Wait, was Cloud Manor that wealthy?]But Zhuo Fan rolled his eyes at Luo Yunchang\u2019s radiant smile.[Women are all the same. They all love to compare\u2026]Meanwhile, in a dark room of the Sun clan sat four people. Three of them had their faces hidden, though unable to hide the vile energy they gave off, while the fourth was Hell Valley\u2019s 8th elder, Condor Jian Fan.The handsome youth standing before them with a creepy smile was Yang Ming. Also known as You Ming in Hell Valley.\u201cYou Ming,\u201d Elder Jian began, \u201cYou hid for more than a decade in Blackwind Mountain. You\u2019ve done well! But this isn\u2019t a job for a girl.\u201d\u201cThere was an incident, but it was taken care of!\u201d You Ming smiled.Whoosh!A black light trailed his face, drawing blood.You Ming was appalled Elder Jian would strike him.Staring at him, Elder Jian said unfeelingly, \u201cThis secret plan had been going for a decade. If your overconfidence ruins the house\u2019s plan, I will make you beg for death.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d You Ming bowed as cold sweat formed.\u201cLeave.\u201d Elder Jian waved, \u201cWe\u2019ll begin three days from now.\u201dYou Ming was at the door when he caught Elder Jian\u2019s sneer, \u201cNo Luo clan member is allowed to live, especially\u2026\u201d\u201cZhuo Fan!\u201d You Ming paused after each word.Nodding, Elder Jian\u2019s killing intent surged, \u201cEven if Veiled Dragon Pavilion used him to kill You Quan, his hands are stained with your junior brother\u2019s blood. No such person shall live in this world!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dYou Ming gnashed his teeth, his smile bloodthirsty\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But his lack of Yuan Qi blocked his advance.If he had known, he would\u2019ve spent more time on Blackwind Mountain to absorb more people\u2019s Yuan Qi. But since he was pressed for time, he only let Blood Infant do the killing, wasting good materials in the process.With the battle knocking at his door, he refrained from letting Blood Infant roam. It would be a huge loss for it to die if Elder Jian bumped into Blood Infant.Zhuo Fan muttered, \u201cI can only hold it in. It will not be long before they attack!\u201dYet, his last word was followed by a terrifying power looming ever closer towards his direction.He ran out of the house and jumped onto the roof to see a man was already there, floating in the sky, Long Jiu.He too felt the power approaching closer and closer, as his single eye squinted with the release of killing intent. Despite this place being a hundred meters from Veiled Dragon Pavilion, Zhuo Fan shivered from the intense desire to kill.\u201cI knew it. They\u2019re Profound Heaven experts!\u201dEven if Zhuo Fan couldn\u2019t pinpoint Long Jiu\u2019s power, figuring out his stage was easy. Hovering in the sky was all the proof he needed. As for the other two elders, they were even stronger.Thinking of them, he swept the area, but Zhuo Fan saw no shadow of them. They had to be laying an ambush to trap Jian Fan.Zhuo Fan sported a wicked grin.The three elders\u2019 plan showed Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s decision to fight Hell Valley to the death, regardless of consequences. This left no room for amicable conciliation, while also securing the Luo clan\u2019s safety.\u201cZhuo Fan, what happened?\u201dLuo Yunchang with Lei Yuting and the rest came outside. Zhuo Fan guessed Mountain Lord hadn\u2019t finished digesting the pill since he didn\u2019t come. Zhuo Fan sorely lacked a peak expert.He yelled, \u201cWhat are you doing? Get back inside!\u201dTheir little power was nothing to a Profound Heaven expert, unlike Zhuo Fan who relied on the Nine Heavens Coiling Dragon Array.Luo Yunchang knew the gravity of the situation from Zhuo Fan\u2019s tense face. She took her brother and the others to hide in the house while also saying, \u201cZhuo Fan, be careful!\u201dZhuo Fan nodded.A sudden cawing echoed in their ears and a black cloud floated above Veiled Dragon Pavilion. With a laugh, a black-robed old man walked out of the cloud. The few strands of hair on his head drifted in the wind as his evil eyes narrowed on Long Jiu. But even so, he couldn\u2019t help spare the small courtyard a glance.\u201cCondor Jian Fan, how dare you step into my domain?\u201d Long Jiu\u2019s one and only eye was bloodshot. His bone-deep hatred seeped into every word he uttered.Snickering, Condor Jian Fan laughed, \u201cLong Jiu, Veiled Dragon Pavilion killed Hell Valley\u2019s disciple, You Quan. You\u2019re saying I can\u2019t even come to seek justice?\u201d\u201cJustice? Since when did Hell Valley know the meaning of the word?\u201dLong Jiu\u2019s breathing grew ragged from the grudge he carried, \u201cWho then plotted against me in Drifting Leaves City? Who then set a trap for me and ruined my Purple Lightning Gold Eye?\u201d[Purple Lightning Gold Eye?]Zhuo Fan didn\u2019t expect the people in the mortal domain to cultivate such a remarkable ability.The legend of the Purple Lightning Gold Eye went back to the time of the ten emperors, pertaining to one of the top three emperors, Heavenly Emperor\u2019s mystic eye. It released a golden light, divine lightning that could crush Heaven. Even a Saint Stage expert would fall from his gaze.Yet, this amazing cultivation method appeared in the mortal domain. He was curious as to how in Heavens Long Jiu managed to cultivate it. If it was cultivated to the 6th Heaven, it was a pity to have it ruined.Even he, the Demonic Emperor, would feel the same hatred as if having his wife stolen or his father killed.\u201cHa-ha-ha\u2026\u201dJian Fan wasn\u2019t the least bit ashamed and laughed instead, \u201cWho is to blame for your idiocy? Relying on your eye, you became a top expert in the Veiled Dragon Pavilion. Without this crutch, you\u2019ve degenerated to become one of the nine elders, stuck to defend Windgaze City. Oh, the horror.\u201d\u201cJian Fan!\u201dLong Jiu\u2019s energy blew with his rage and even his eye was on the verge of bleeding, \u201cI will have my revenge!\u201dLong Jiu charged as a golden dragon coiled around his hand.\u201cMid spirit ranked martial art, Soaring Dragon Claw!\u201dRoar!The dragon roared and left Long Jiu\u2019s arm, bearing its fangs at the enemy.Jian Fan sneered and simply waved his hand.A black mist formed chains as it left his sleeve, binding the golden dragon. With a twist of his hand, the golden dragon wailed and shattered to pieces.\u201cMid spirit ranked martial art, Hell Chains!\u201dJian Fan mocked, \u201cLong Jiu, you were a dragon with your eye before, but you are now a mere bug. The name of Godeye Long Jiu will never rise again\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish, a palm appeared before him and a claw grabbed his wrist.\u201cVeiled Dragon Claw!\u201dJian Fan was unable to escape the vise but he wasn\u2019t too worried as he laughed, \u201cHumph, think you can face me with mortal ranked martial arts when even spirit ranked martial arts are useless?\u201d\u201cHe-he-he, I don\u2019t need to take your life, just\u2026\u201dGrinning, Long Jiu threw Jian Fan to the ground! The blond and the red-haired elders jumped from nearby to attack him.\u201cNot good!\u201dJian Fan started panicking.Only now did he realize Long Jiu\u2019s ploy. Long Jiu wanted to trap him with two others, cutting off his escape.[Long Jiu is set on killing me, but\u2026]Jian Fan grinned.\u201cNow!\u201dThe black cloud revealed two men in black as they converged on Long Jiu.This left Long Jiu and the elders in shock. But thanks to Zhuo Fan\u2019s intelligence, they had a contingency in place.\u201cOld Jiu, hold fast!\u201dThe blond elder moved swiftly towards Jian Fan with the red-haired elder behind him, ignoring Long Jiu\u2019s fate.Long Jiu grinned as a golden light shined on his palm and a dragon-shaped sword appeared, \u201cAs long as you kill Jian Fan, I can die in peace.\u201d\u201c3rd-grade spiritual weapon, Dragon Sword?\u201dThe two men in black stopped in their attacks and dodged the incoming sword attack.Whoosh!A golden light passed just an inch from them as a thunderclap followed behind it. The light split the sky in half and only after ten breaths did it recover.The two men in black felt dread while retreating ten steps. They didn\u2019t expect Long Jiu to use a treasure to deal with them.\u201cGood!\u201dThe blond elder shouted in glee. Long Jiu\u2019s attack scared the two men. He wrapped himself in golden light and charged at Jian Fan.Attacked from two sides, Jian Fan was like meat on a chopping board.\u201cOld Jiu, take a look, see how third brother ends him.\u201dThe blond elder laughed as he attacked. Despite not using a martial art, ear-piercing sounds were heard as his hand moved.Jian Fan began to sweat as his eyes squinted, feeling death breathing down his neck\u2026Boom!But then a purple light exploded. It not only blocked the attack but even forced the blond elder to cough blood.The red-haired elder rushed to check on him while the blond elder ignored his wounds and stared at the rolling smoke.As for Long Jiu, he was shocked.When the smoke scattered, it revealed a panting Jian Fan. But this time, he was no longer afraid and even grew rampant having escaped death.\u201cThat was close. Didn\u2019t think Veiled Dragon Pavilion would send 5th and 3rd elders after me! Devastating Gold Dragon and World-burning Fire Dragon, your reputation precedes you!\u201dThe two elders were staring, not at Jian Fan, but at the thing on his shoulder\u2026Soul Devouring Crow!Zhuo Fan frowned.He didn\u2019t expect for Elder Jian to have such a demonic creature.The Soul Devouring Crow\u2019s body wasn\u2019t formidable, but it can devour anything and transfer what it swallowed to its owner. Soul Devouring Crow\u2019s power depended on its owner. But one thing was certain, Soul Devouring Crow was among the strong demonic creatures.Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyebrows shook as he looked into the crow\u2019s eyes. One was black, while the other was golden and released a purple light. Even faint thunder sounds came out.\u201c3rd Heaven, Purple Lightning Gold Eye!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He used to move unhindered thanks to that same eye and even earned the name Godeye Long Jiu.But the godeye was now his enemy\u2019s weapon to be used against him.\u201cI-impossible!\u201d Long Jiu shook his head in denial.Jian Fan\u2019s laughter was unrestrained, \u201cLong Jiu, did you ever think that your precious Purple Lightning Gold Eye will one day be put to use on my demonic creature? If you want to kill me, you\u2019ll have to first overcome this eye.\u201dThen he began making hand signs.The crow flew and purple light glinted in its golden eye, rumbling as it charged at Long Jiu.\u201cWatch out!\u201dThe blond elder woke Long Jiu out of his stupor in time to defend with his Dragon Sword.Boom!Long Jiu was struck down by one purple lightning after another and was blown away coughing blood.The two elders rushed to Jian Fan in panic. They knew that as long as Jian Fan stopped his hands, the crow would stop moving.But how could Jian Fan not see such an obvious flaw?Sneering, he gestured again and caused two explosions, the purple lightning struck the two elders. They bore the brunt as it sent them flying and blood leaked from their mouths.Zhuo Fan was shocked by how vicious the Purple Lightning Gold Eye was. It was only in 3rd Heaven and it could already outclass a Profound Heaven expert.As matters stood, Veiled Dragon Pavilion would lose, and the Luo clan would be next.\u201cNo, I cannot let that happen.\u201dSquinting, Zhuo Fan gnashed his teeth and pointed, sending a red light at Jian Fan.He was taking a huge gamble. If Blood Infant was found out, it would die in a blink from the purple lighting, and him along with it.But if he stood at the sidelines, the Luo clan would be sure to fall for good.Zhuo Fan hardened his heart and sent the Blood Infant on the offensive.Jian Fan was focused on Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s three elders and was oblivious to the incoming danger.\u201cHa-ha-ha, Purple Lightning Gold Eye is awesome. Not even together are you three fools its match.\u201d The crow flew back to Jian Fan\u2019s shoulder as he cackled.The two men in black flew to either side of Jian Fan and grinned.The three Veiled Dragon Pavilion elders\u2019 faces darkened. The enemy looked down on them despite acting together. This was the first time this ever happened.If they lost here today, Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s reputation would be thrown into the mud, all thanks to them.\u201cDon\u2019t think you can win with a damn demonic creature and a stolen eye, Condor.\u201d The blond elder\u2019s eyes flashed golden and exploded with killing intent.\u201cOld Jiu, old Wu, stay here. I will take their heads.\u201dWhile shocked, the red-haired elder saw the determination in his eyes and nodded, as did Long Jiu.As they were all elders of Veiled Dragon Pavilion, they knew the blond old man\u2019s true power.Once the Devastating Gold Dragon was enraged, he would split the earth and shatter the heavens. During the time when Long Jiu had his eye, there were three people in Veiled Dragon Pavilion he couldn\u2019t beat.1st and 2nd elder were the first two, while the last was the enraged 3rd elder.Whoosh!A dazzling golden light shined and started covering him with a thick film, like a golden armor. Each time his finger moved, it let out a metallic sound.Jian Fan\u2019s face turned grave, picking up on the threat to his life the old man\u2019s change promised.\u201cAllow me to educate you that the name of Devastating Gold Dragon isn\u2019t an empty title.\u201dThe blond elder formed claws with his hands, all the while radiating in gold and staring at Jian Fan with a cold gaze. Then he rushed at Jian Fan. In his charge, the elder brought his hands together, just like scissors.Roar!A dragon roar echoed in the pitch-black night. Jian Fan saw the blond elder appeared surrounded by the image of a huge dragon.It unclenched its jaws and followed the blond elder\u2019s claws to swallow the three enemies whole.\u201cHigh spirit ranked martial art, Devouring Dragon Claw!\u201dStartled, Jian Fan hastened his hand gestures to control the crow\u2019s Purple Lightning Gold Eye.Boom! And a purple light flashed!But this time, when the lightning fell on the dragon, it bounced off like a bullet, not even able to slow it down.Jian Fan panicked, unable to believe that the blond elder would be so strong that he could deflect Purple Lightning Gold Eye\u2019s attack. But he did notice how the dragon\u2019s golden aura dimmed.\u201cHell Chains!\u201dJian Fan and his two men moved together. Tens of black chains flew from their arms and fell on the dragon like a dark cloud.The chains tightened and the dragon body was rendered motionless under their vise, yet the dragon still lingered, wanting to press on the attack.\u201cYou\u2019re not Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s 3rd elder for nothing, needing all three of us to hold you back.\u201dJian Fan gave his all in grasping the black chains along with his men. They even began to sweat.The 3rd elder gnashed his teeth, his lips curling in disdain, \u201cYou think the three of you could\u2019ve held me if not for the Purple Lightning Gold Eye?\u201d\u201cHe-he-he, you\u2019re right. We still have the Purple Lightning Gold Eye.\u201dJian Fan snickered, now that 3rd elder reminded him, he used the hand that held the black chains to make hand signs. With a cawing sound, purple lightning flashed.The 3rd elder\u2019s scalp went numb.Both sides were in a deadlock. If the purple lighting hit, it would spell heavy wounds, if not death.\u201cThird brother!\u201dLong Jiu and the red-haired elder were nervous, rushing to help despite not making it in time.Seeing 3rd elder\u2019s fate sealed under the purple lightning, Jian Fan grinned.It was at this moment when Zhuo Fan, who was just a hundred feet away, showed a mystifying smile.\u201cUsing this chaos, I\u2019ll take your life. I can\u2019t have the Veiled Dragon Pavilion lose such an important battle!\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s killing intent spiked as his hand moved. The Blood Infant lying in wait just around the corner sprung up from its hiding place, aiming for Jian Fan. With Jian Fan and his two men focused on 3rd elder, they were oblivious to the impending danger.\u201cHe-he-he, die, 3rd elder!\u201dJian Fan cackled as the crow\u2019s eye spilled purple lightning. But then a sudden flash of red entered his body and felt his breath hampered, dispelling the black chains from his hand.\u201cElder Jian, what are you doing?\u201d His two men jumped in fright.Jian Fan found something burrowing in his body and wanted to expel it but it was too late\u20263rd elder pressed his advantage and exploded with power.Roar!The dragon burst out of the chains and bit down.The two men\u2019s eyes squinted as they fled. But the pitiful Elder Jian was rooted in place thanks to Blood Infant\u2019s control. The next instant, an arm flew way up high.3rd elder grabbed it and stood with pride as he laughed at the one-armed Jian Fan and his men.\u201cCurse you. Veiled Dragon Pavilion went as far as refining demonic creatures to make a sneak attack\u2026\u201dJian Fan clenched his teeth as his heart bled with grief. Thinking how a veteran demonic cultivator as himself was hampered by a demonic creature left a bad taste in his mouth. Would he get any respect from others now? What was even worse was that this was done by righteous cultivators.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dJian Fan knew he lost the advantage and there was nothing to gain from fighting a losing battle.Yet Long Jiu wasn\u2019t one to let them go.\u201cAfter them!\u201d3rd elder\u2019s feelings were mutual and shouted while pursuing them.The Blood Infant returned inside Zhuo Fan without anyone\u2019s knowledge. He smiled. [It\u2019s best for Hell Valley to put this blame on Veiled Dragon Pavilion. Their hatred isn\u2019t light anyway and a bit more won\u2019t affect them.]Zhuo Fan justified his actions.Just that he couldn\u2019t help the Purple Lightning Gold Eye to catch his attention.\u201cOne way or another, I\u2019ll have to get it.\u201d Zhuo Fan rubbed his chin as his eyes roamed around. Few things caught the Demonic Emperor\u2019s eye, and the Celestial Emperor\u2019s Purple Lightning Gold Eye happened to be one of them.\u201cKill!\u201dBut then, a group of men in black charged into Veiled Dragon Pavilion. They were all Bone Tempering experts.However, Veiled Dragon Pavilion had a contingency in place and Long Jie led his own team to repel the enemies. Mere moments after the two sides clashed, Long Kui came out to meet them with her own team from the small courtyard.During the Profound Heaven experts\u2019 battle, they remained hidden, waiting for the right moment to strike. They waited for all of Hell Valley\u2019s men to charge in so they could kill them all in one go.Hell Valley acted as if they didn\u2019t expect an ambush and retreated with Long Jie and Long Kui hot on their tails.No sooner did they retreat after the initial \u2018attack\u2019, leaving the Luo clan and the ones in the small courtyard.\u201cAren\u2019t they baiting?\u201dZhuo Fan was calm, having known Hell Valley\u2019s plan. He was waiting for the true mastermind to come out.Soon after, Yang Ming appeared leading Blackwind Mountain bandits.Zhuo Fan smirked, \u201cHell Valley had paid a heavy price to have the Lei clan wipe out the Luo clan. I wonder how far are they willing to go?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And kill the Luo clan!\u201d Yang Ming extended his hand.Whoosh!A breeze passed, followed by Zhuo Fan landing from the roof and barring their path, \u201cPeople, the way is closed off. Please go back, for your own sake.\u201dThe bandits stopped in shock. Yang Ming stepped from among them and snickered, \u201cAre you from the Luo clan?\u201dZhuo Fan nodded, \u201cI am Luo clan\u2019s steward, Zhuo Fan.\u201d\u201cZhuo Fan?\u201d Yang Ming exposed a savage grin, \u201cHere I was wondering where to look for you and yet you were kind enough to jump right in my path.\u201d\u201cWhoever brings me his head will get a reward.\u201d Yang Ming shouted to the bandits around him.\u201cOh!\u201dUnder Yang Ming\u2019s enticing offer, the bandits shot for Zhuo Fan like cannonballs.Zhuo Fan sneered inside, [What could 2nd layer Qi Condensation cultivators possibly do?]In but a breath, Zhuo Fan\u2019s hand moved like a shadow, touching the head of the first victim that dared to step close and sending out black energy through the use of Demon Transformation Art.Under the shocked gaze of the rest, the victim turned to dust and was swept away by the wind.Even Yang Ming was scared, never seeing such a ruthless killing method despite his stay in the Hell Valley which was filled with its fair share of demonic cultivating monsters. If he was scared, the bandits were horrified.Despite Zhuo Fan having killed a weakling, how he did it drew a far greater reaction out of them.\u201cT-that\u2019s the best demonic method!\u201dYang Ming\u2019s eyes flickered on and off, gone was his disdain for Zhuo Fan, now replaced by endless caution, \u201cWho the hell are you? There\u2019s no way the Luo clan could have someone like you.\u201dWith a sinister smile, Zhuo Fan pretended to caress an imaginary beard while speaking in an aged voice, \u201cLittle brother, did you forget? This old man is but a swindler.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201dYang Ming realized he was the old guy accompanying Lei Yuting before. Since he was here, that meant\u2026Killing Intent flashed as Yang Ming spoke, \u201cWhere are they?\u201dZhuo Fan shook his head, \u201cAre you dumb or what? Since I\u2019m here, of course they\u2019re here with me.\u201dYang Ming\u2019s heart tightened. If the old man and Lei Yuting came out, his control over the Blackwind Mountain bandits would crumble.\u201cI should\u2019ve killed you two from the start.\u201d Yang Ming\u2019s Yuan Qi exploded. His Bone Tempering power caused the bandits to flinch back three steps.Zhuo Fan only shook his head, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have attacked, not until you saw Xiao Cui. For you to have hidden for so long in the Blackwind Mountain shows your careful nature, unable to accept the smallest mistake. Until you knew for certain Xiao Cui\u2019s location, you\u2019d never kill her master.\u201dYang Ming\u2019s heart was in upheaval.Never for the likes of him could he imagine a stranger had such a piercing analysis of him, that could see through his every move. He was far more cunning than even the old men in the Hell Valley.He had to die.As Zhuo Fan words landed, the bandits began to doubt.Yang Ming couldn\u2019t drag this any longer, for fear of exposing himself for good and ruining the house\u2019s plan. He chose to attack Zhuo Fan.Zhuo Fan\u2019s demonic method left him in shock, but as Zhuo Fan was but a 4th layer Qi Condensation cultivator, he could kill him in one blow.Zhuo Fan was taken aback by Yang Ming\u2019s sudden attack and retreated, \u201cHave you no dignity? How can a Bone Tempering cultivator use all his power against a Qi Condensation cultivator?\u201dYang Ming cackled, \u201cYou think I\u2019m as dumb as You Quan to be caught off guard by you?\u201dHis finger extended and lightning blossomed, the same move used by the Lei clan, Lightning Finger.For early Bone Tempering Yang Ming to use a spirit ranked martial art on Zhuo Fan showed the desperation he had in wishing to kill him.And yet, despite his opponent\u2019s fierce momentum, Zhuo Fan stopped and spread his arms as he welcomed Yang Ming with a mystifying smile.Yang Ming was unnerved, but not enough to curb his attack.Zhuo Fan then curled a finger and a yellow light encased him.Yang Ming collided with the light and bounced off while coughing blood.\u201cWhat is that?\u201dYang Ming was dumbstruck in the face of such a light. He only felt as if Zhuo Fan\u2019s finger held the power to send him flying.How did he do it?[Wasn\u2019t he just a Qi Condensation punk? Didn\u2019t You Quan give him a heavy wound? How is he so strong?]Zhuo Fan chuckled at Yang Ming\u2019s puzzlement as his hand moved, \u201cYou\u2019re a bit stronger than You Quan, but still trash. The only fate of trash\u2026 is death!\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s eyes flashed with killing intent.A golden dragon burst out of the ground and swooped down on Yang Ming. Its majestic power brought everyone else to their knees.Yang Ming felt fear and wanted to curse.[Blast it, the house lied to me!][Didn\u2019t they say this punk can only sneak attack? How does he have this much power? If that dragon attacks, not even my bones will remain.][Only a Profound Heaven expert has such power!]The Blackwind Mountain bandits were terrified. Didn\u2019t Hell Valley bait all the experts? Why was one still here? [No one from the seven houses is trustworthy.]\u201cStop!\u201dJust when the golden dragon was poised to strike, a shout came. The bandits knew it belonged to their Young miss and hope rose within them.Zhuo Fan snorted.Yet the next moment tens of black chains descended from the black cloud above. They not only tied the dragon up but also crushed it.Zhuo Fan looked with contracted pupils.The black cloud was the same one the three elders from the Hell Valley relied on before.\u201cThere was another one?\u201d Frowning, Zhuo Fan knew the black cloud hid another elder.\u201cHe-he-he\u2026\u201dA man descended from the black clouds and landed in front of Yang Ming. Lei Yuting also arrived next to Zhuo Fan and glared, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to stop?\u201d\u201cAnyone who stands in my way is my enemy. Why should I listen to you?\u201d Zhuo Fan didn\u2019t look at her, only staring at the newcomer.Lei Yuting snorted.\u201cSigh, that old Jian Fan told me to watch over the Blackwind Mountain bandits. I thought it was a waste of time and did not take it seriously.\u201d The man waved, \u201cYou Ming, leave!\u201d\u201cNo, Elder Yun. I want to get Zhuo Fan\u2019s head myself, for junior brother You Quan\u2019s revenge.\u201d You Ming glared at Zhuo Fan.Bam!The man gave him an unexpected slap, sending him flying.\u201cYou think you can?\u201dThe man sneered, \u201cYou can\u2019t even match his skill, so go back to Hell Valley! This doesn\u2019t concern you anymore.\u201d\u201cElder Yun\u2026\u201dYou Ming was distracted seeing the unfeeling gaze in the man\u2019s eyes. He never saw Elder Yun like this. You Ming was among the best in Hell Valley and no elder ever looked at him with such cold eyes.\u201cW-why?\u201dThe man snorted, \u201cDespite your scheming heart, I used to see you as a man of talent, worthy of raising. But now that I met this youngster, I realized you are nothing more than an insect.\u201dThe man then turned to Zhuo Fan with a smile, \u201cChild, you have one chance, join Hell Valley and all our differences shall be made void. Or\u2026\u201dWhoosh!He swiped and a black chain tightened tens of Blackwind Mountain bandits. He pulled a bit and all that was left were pieces of flesh.\u201cOr follow in their footsteps.\u201dShock spread to those still alive to see this and Lei Yuting glared in rage at him.Rubbing his chin, Zhuo Fan smiled, \u201cWasn\u2019t Hell Valley using Blackwind Mountain to save its reputation. Why kill them?\u201d\u201cWith how smart you are, I\u2019m sure you can figure it out.\u201d The man snickered, \u201cSince our plan is out in the open, I would rather avoid raising doubts in them by killing all now.\u201d\u201cThem? Who\u2019s that?\u201d Zhuo Fan frowned.The man shook his head, \u201cYou will know once you join us.\u201dZhuo Fan only laughed, \u201cTo me, Hell Valley is the same as he is to you, a mere insect.\u201dHe pointed at You Ming with a taunt.The man\u2019s ire grew, \u201cKid, don\u2019t you fear death?\u201dZhuo Fan snickered, \u201cCan you deliver it?\u201dThe man jumped and hacked his palm in rage at Zhuo Fan, \u201cDie!\u201dZhuo Fan made a gesture and a yellow light blocked the attack.You Ming saw them clash with jealousy and hatred. He was considered outstanding and was sent on an important mission to Blackwind Mountain. But Zhuo Fan\u2019s sudden appearance ruined everything.It even caused the elder to abandon him.\u201cZhuo Fan, you\u2019ll see.\u201d You Ming wiped the blood from his mouth and fled.Lei Yuting chased at once and the two were gone moments later.Zhuo Fan, on the other hand, faced the man with the help of the array. Seeing her go, he sighed, \u201cFoolish girl!\u201d And he sent Blood Infant to follow them in secret\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After twenty-odd hits, the man floated in the air and sneered, \u201cYou\u2019re really something to be able to control the 3rd-grade Coiling Dragon Array at such a young age. It\u2019s most unfortunate you met me.\u201dHe then rushed towards Zhuo Fan again as the latter formed a golden dome of light to stop him. Having foreseen this, the man gathered 20% more power in his palm before striking.The dome crumbled under the devastating blow and he continued to speed towards Zhuo Fan, \u201cHumph, the power of Profound Heaven isn\u2019t something a Qi Condensation kid can even begin to imagine.\u201dZhuo Fan smiled and muttered, \u201cA 5th-grade array isn\u2019t something a novice can comprehend either.\u201dWith a snort, Zhuo Fan\u2019s hand signs took a sudden change.\u201c1st Heaven!\u201dRoar!A golden dragon erupted from the ground and moved to attack Elder Yun.With disdain plainly seen on his face, Elder Yun waved tens of black chains around the dragon and crushed it.Just as the dragon dissipated, Zhuo Fan\u2019s gesture changed again.\u201c2nd Heaven!\u201dRoar! Roar!Two golden dragons charged this time.Shocked, the man never saw this array forming two dragon images. This exceeded his understanding of the Coiling Dragon Array.But it wasn\u2019t something out of his control. Both of his arms moved and the dragons were crushed under black chains.Even before the man could take a breather, Zhuo Fan shouted two times.\u201c3rd Heaven!\u201dThree dragons took to the skies!\u201c4th Heaven.\u201d And the fourth dragon appeared.\u201c5th Heaven, 6th Heaven\u2026, 9th Heaven.\u201d A total of nine golden dragons roamed the skies as their fearsome roars echoed everywhere.Every great clan in the city burrowed deeper into their homes, without daring to make a peep. This battle was by far the most horrifying one in their lives.The man was gasping for breath and looked appalled at the majestic scene. Never in his wildest dream could he ever conceive that a Qi Condensation child was able to control such an imposing array.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the Coiling Dragon Array!\u201d The man saw the nine golden dragons setting their vicious sights on their enemy, him.Zhuo Fan gave a cruel grin, \u201cThis is the 5th-grade array, Nine Heavens Coiling Dragon Array. Try it, if you have the nerve.\u201dAfter a deep look at Zhuo Fan, the man cackled, \u201cHow amusing. To think a kid can control a 5th-grade array! I am more and more intrigued.\u201d\u201cFor the last time, will you join Hell Valley?\u201d The man\u2019s fervent look was akin to gazing upon a priceless treasure.But he only received disdain, \u201cI\u2019ve never once considered joining a run-down place like yours!\u201d\u201cSince you chose to keep that road shut, the only path left is to your death.\u201dThe man flew like the wind, with all his killing intent focused on Zhuo Fan.Zhuo Fan was but a teenager, but the ruthless and calculative mind coupled with his preeminent talent left the man with dread for the future.It was best to avoid any future mishaps and kill him on the spot.Zhuo Fan was clear of Elder Yun\u2019s intention and with a hand sign from him, he sent the nine dragons to attack the Elder.Nine dragon tails charged.An ear-piercing sound came and the man had to come face to face with the awe-inspiring power of nine dragon tails, stopping him dead in his tracks.His only choice was to unleash his black chains, hoping their power was enough.Rumble!Under the shaking sky and spinning ground, the man\u2019s chains and the dragon tails clashed. It resulted in him being sent flying.He flew fifty meters before landing, puking blood the first instance his body made contact with the ground.Zhuo Fan mocked, \u201cHow did you become an elder with just this much strength? How did Hell Valley even wiggle its way among the Seven Noble Houses?\u201dThe man was about to spout obscenities.Who\u2019d imagine this day would come when a Qi Condensation child would toy with him. Once word got out, he\u2019d be the butt of the empire\u2019s joke!Even if he returned to the valley, the Valley Lord wouldn\u2019t let him off with just a tongue lashing.\u201cKid, even if you go down on your knees and beg, I will still kill you.\u201dHis eyes bloodshot, a golden ring appeared on the man\u2019s hand exuding a dreadful aura.\u201cDemonic treasure?\u201dZhuo Fan started to get serious.A demonic treasure was a demonic cultivator\u2019s weapon, just as how a spiritual weapon was to a righteous cultivator. With it, the man\u2019s power would multiply.\u201cHell Valley\u2019s elder, have you no shame? To use a demonic treasure against a Qi Condensation junior?\u201d Zhuo Fan mocked.But Elder Yun replied with a savage grin, \u201cHe-he-he, who will be able to tell when everyone\u2019s dead?\u201dZhuo Fan was anxious now.He wanted to provoke Elder Yun just so he could avoid this situation. But when up against a demonic cultivator, they would stoop to any low. Then again, if it were him, he\u2019d come to the same decision as well.If a righteous cultivator gave up his life for honor, fought for justice and yet still died gruesomely, a demonic cultivator would only take that man for a fool.This was why no demonic cultivator would ever wish to battle with another demonic cultivator. They were ruthless, scheming and sinister characters and the only outcome of fighting them was one victor and one loser with no in-between, particularly in the shameless one\u2019s case.\u201cHe-he-he, die, kid!\u201dThe man attacked again and Zhuo Fan sent the nine dragon tails to fend him off.But this time, the ring flashed silver light and increased the man\u2019s speed, cutting through the tails like a silver saber.\u201cSo fast!\u201dZhuo Fan sucked a cold breath. He knew the man\u2019s newfound power was all because of the ring.The silver light then flashed in front of him, followed by the man\u2019s vicious grin, \u201cKid, there\u2019s nowhere left for you to run.\u201dZhuo Fan clenched his teeth seeing the ring\u2019s saw blade edge. The silver light seemed to cut even the air.\u201c3rd-grade demonic treasure?\u201d Zhuo Fan smiled.\u201cGood eye.\u201d The man nodded, \u201cYou\u2019re the first Qi Condensation with the honor of dying from this 3rd-grade demonic treasure, Savage Moon.\u201d\u201cWait.\u201d Zhuo Fan waved frantically, \u201cIf I join Hell Valley now\u2026\u201d\u201cToo late!\u201d The man laughed as Savage Moon approached Zhuo Fan.Zhuo Fan didn\u2019t want to die, he just got reincarnated. But all he could do was sigh and close his eyes.Boom!A sudden thunderclap reached his ears and Zhuo Fan could still feel that he was alive. Opening his eyes, he saw a tall old man in front with blood trickling down his arm.The old man was facing Elder Yun, who\u2019s Savage Moon\u2019s blade was stained in fresh blood.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Elder Yun asked.\u201cBlackwind Mountain\u2019s Lei Yuntian!\u201d As the old man shouted, lightning flashed all over him, \u201cAny that dares to mess with the Luo clan are my enemies.\u201dZhuo Fan now knew the old man was, in fact, the Mountain Lord of Blackwind Mountain. Before, he was but a bedridden patient and now was back to his health.\u201cYou\u2019ve recovered?\u201d Zhuo Fan was overjoyed.Smiling, Lei Yuntian expressed his thanks, \u201cThanks to Steward Zhuo\u2019s kindness, I\u2019ve not only recovered but also entered the Profound Heaven Stage.\u201dZhuo Fan was in glee. That was exactly what he needed right now.\u201cHumph, what can a Qi Condensation kid and a fresh Profound Heaven geezer do? You\u2019ll all die just the same under my Savage Moon\u2019s blade!\u201dHe lifted the bloody Savage Moon.\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure.\u201d Chuckling, Zhuo Fan made a sign and nine golden dragons soared, \u201cOld man Lei, please hear me out. This time we\u2019ll be taking this geezer\u2019s life.\u201dLei Yuntian saw the confidence in Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes and nodded. While their enemy seemed to have heard the biggest joke in his life.\u201cHa-ha-ha, I\u2019ve broken through your array once, kid. This Profound Heaven old man\u2019s cultivation is still unstable, not enough to take my life!\u201dSmirking, Zhuo Fan muttered, \u201cWhen I use someone, I never take any rules into consideration. This is our best chance, old man Lei. Attack!\u201d\u201cGood!\u201dSince Zhuo Fan saved his life once, Lei Yuntian had faith in him. He knew the enemy was stronger than him but still chose to face him.\u201cLightning Finger!\u201dElder Yun sneered and sent black chains. Even if Lei Yuntian did not die from this attack, he\u2019d still be sporting heavy wounds.However, the nine golden dragons charged into battle as well.Elder Yun had no choice but to soar up and use the silver light from his weapon to cut the dragons in two. The dragons were unable to stop his assault as he inched closer to Zhuo Fan.\u201cIt\u2019s best I kill you first.\u201dElder Yun\u2019s speed left Zhuo Fan without time to make a hand sign, but Lei Yuntian appeared with his Lightning Finger aimed at the Elder\u2019s throat.\u201cYou\u2019re asking for it!\u201d The man had to shift Savage Moon\u2019s target from Zhuo Fan to the Lei Yuntian. Lei Yuntian showed a gratified smile, still willing to attack Elder Yun. For Lei Yuntian, even if Zhuo Fan had intended to send him to his death, he\u2019d be willing.Dying for the Luo clan\u2019s sake was a good death to him.Yet something happened just when Savage Moon was nearing the old man\u2019s chest.Thanks to the old man\u2019s distraction, Zhuo Fan finished his hand signs and bit his tongue, spitting blood essence, \u201cHumph, have a taste of Nine Heavens Coiling Dragon Array\u2019s real power!\u201dThe nine cut dragons turned into golden dots and rushed to Zhuo Fan. A glorious and ancient roar was released, followed by a huge dragon far greater than all the previous nine dragons combined.This new dragon immediately rushed towards Elder Yun.The man\u2019s eyes narrowed as his heart shook, but it was already too late.The new dragon\u2019s speed was even greater than Savage Moon\u2019s. He couldn\u2019t even poise Savage Moon to defend and the dragon crashed into him, carrying him off into the sky.\u201cHow can\u2026 a Qi Condensation brat\u2026\u201dFollowing his final wail, the dragon held the man in its jaws and exploded\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The shockwave even put pressure on the building, despite being so far, while other houses crumbled in the aftermath.Deafening noise from the explosion attacked people\u2019s ears even as they covered them up and laid trembling on the ground. This sound attack lasted for a full minute.But nothing could erase that dreadful image from their hearts, nothing\u2026A hundred miles out, two men in black fought as they fled from Long Jiu\u2019s group.\u201cWhere is that bastard Jian Fan?\u201d Long Jiu\u2019s anger spiked when he caught no sight of his mortal enemy, \u201cSon of a-, that old dog must\u2019ve left these two to stall us.\u201d\u201cForget it.\u201d 3rd elder glared with killing intent, \u201cLet\u2019s finish off these two first!\u201dUnder the three elder\u2019s united assault, the two men in black were sweating bullets, having no choice but to fight.Then, a dreadful noise came from Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s direction, followed by a golden light that lit up the whole sky. The five people stopped their attack and stood in shock.\u201cWhat was that? Did another expert appear?\u201d 3rd elder felt his ears rumbling and sucked in a cold breath, \u201cBut\u2026 which expert could\u2019ve unleashed such a move?\u201d\u201cRetreat!\u201dWith no time to waste, 3rd elder shouted as he flew back to Veiled Dragon Pavilion. He was far more worried about its wellbeing than the death of these two Hell Valley elders.Though Long Jiu was unwilling, he followed the 3rd elder with a sigh.Seeing the three Veiled Dragon Pavilion elders retreat, the two men in black let out a sigh of relief, yet were still puzzled by how the events turned out.They knew an elder was there to make sure the plan didn\u2019t go south. But even that elder wasn\u2019t powerful enough for this kind of feat. Plus, a bunch of Qi Condensation insects didn\u2019t garner such a heavy hand either.The answer was quite simple in this case, another expert much stronger than Elder Yun showed up.Hearts heavy with worry, the two discarded any plans of going there to assist Elder Yun. They feared that the Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s three elders might set a trap. So, they took the only viable choice, retreat.[Elder Yun, you\u2019re on your own\u2026]At the small courtyard, Lei Yuntian watched the night sky slack-jawed. He thought Zhuo Fan wanted him to bait Elder Yun and leave him open for a sneak attack.He went with it despite knowing he was a dead man. As long as Luo clan survived, it was worth dying for. But Zhuo Fan defied his imagination. He still acted as bait but did not pay the ultimate price. While the enemy was caught unaware, the lad sprung up with a devastating blow that took Elder Yun\u2019s life, leaving no remains.Recalling the sky-blazing aftermath, Lei Yuntian shuddered. Not only was he surprised, but also shocked.[A Hell Valley\u2019s elder, a Profound Heaven expert, died in one move!][This kid is terrifying\u2026]\u201cOld man Lei!\u201dZhuo Fan caught his breath and stood up weakly.

His faith in the kid had once again strengthened.This was no longer just gratitude for having saved him or faith in a youth\u2019s potential, but the respect for the strong, \u201cSteward Zhuo, if there\u2019s anything you want done, just tell me.\u201dZhuo Fan nodded, \u201cOld man Lei, I\u2019ll leave Luo clan in your care while I go bring Young miss Lei back.\u201d\u201cNo worries, they\u2019ll have to pass over my dead body before they can harm a hair of Yunhai and Yunchang.\u201d Lei Yuntian nodded with resolve.Zhuo Fan showed a relieved smile and went after Lei Yuting.Hell Valley had left only one elder here and he too was dead now. Seeing how no other enemy popped up while fighting, Zhuo Fan was certain Hell Valley only sent four men in total, including the ones Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s elders were chasing.Under a Profound Heaven expert\u2019s careful watch, the Luo clan siblings\u2019 safety was guaranteed. So he could devote all his attention to saving that foolish girl. To be on the safe side, he picked up the Savage Moon first.[A 3rd-grade demonic treasure shouldn\u2019t be wasted.]Yang Ming ran like mad while clutching his chest in the gloomy forest. He was injured from the smack he got from Zhuo Fan\u2019s array, but Elder Yun\u2019s slap made it worse. His mind was clouded and breath ragged.As for the dreadful explosion before, he didn\u2019t have the time to waste on it. But he was shocked nonetheless, finding it inconceivable for Elder Yun and Zhuo Fan\u2019s fight to escalate to such degree.\u201cStop!\u201dA clear and angry shout came from behind, freezing Yang Ming in place. He turned to see Lei Yuting watching him with complex emotions.Making sure she was alone and double-checking Zhuo Fan wasn\u2019t there, Yang Ming relaxed and showed a wicked grin, \u201cJunior sister, you want to stop me all by yourself?\u201dFrowning, Lei Yuting\u2019s eyes turned misty, \u201cFor my godfather, I will help him get rid of such a traitorous disciple.\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, traitorous disciple? I was never one of you in the first place.\u201d Yang Ming mocked her, \u201cMoreover, do you think you can kill me with your strength?\u201d\u201cEven if we are to die together, at least I can repay godfather\u2019s kindness for raising me.\u201d Lei Yuting\u2019s eyes glittered with tears as she stared at him right in the eye, \u201cI just want to know, did you ever love me?\u201dBlack demonic energy drifted from Yang Ming\u2019s hand as he sneered, \u201cI am a genius disciple of Hell Valley. If I am ever to marry, I would choose from among the seven houses. How can I be tied down with the likes of you?\u201dTears fell unabated but Lei Yuting hardened her determination, \u201cThen from now on, we are through.\u201dLei Yuting followed her last word with lightning flickering between her fingers. Yang Ming laughed, hardly afraid, and fought back with the black-colored hand.In the clash between the freezing palm and the flickering lightning, sparks flew.However, Yang Ming dodged Lightning Finger at the last second and struck down Lei Yuting with no remorse.Lei Yuting saw his evil grin and came to terms with the outcome, closing her eyes for death to take her.It was then that a flash of red struck Yang Ming\u2019s black palm.Bam!Yang Ming was sent flying and coughed blood in midair.An infant\u2019s cry came from the red light as it flew into a bush.Waking from her stupor, Lei Yuting saw Yang Ming heavily wounded on the ground and the weakened red light among the bushes.She knew it was Zhuo Fan\u2019s Blood Infant.She stood there in a daze, muttering as she glanced at Blood Infant, \u201cWas it you who saved me?\u201dThe Blood Infant tried to fly again, only to collapse.She did not know of the inseparable bond between Zhuo Fan and the Blood Infant, however, she knew it was something he treasured. But even so, to think that Zhuo Fan would send his treasure to save her.Lei Yuting began to feel warm inside. When she turned her focus to Yang Ming, only killing intent remained in her eyes.Walking over, Lei Yuting\u2019s fingers crackled with lightning.Yang Ming was panicking, wanting to flee but hardly had the energy to get up.\u201cSister Yuting, have mercy. Remember how close we were? Remember how we used to laugh?\u201d Yang Ming shrank backwards while begging.\u201cNow I want to kill you even more!\u201dSnorting, her fingers struck without hesitation.\u201cW-wait, spare me\u2026\u201d Yang Ming wailed, but there was no one to hear his cry.Bam!When Lei Yuting\u2019s attack was about to land, a tremendous power blew her away.A bald elderly landed next to Yang Ming.\u201cElder Jian!\u201d Yang Ming cried out. He took Elder Jian as his savior, having pulled him out of the jaws of death. Never had he been so thrilled to meet an elder from his house.Throwing a side glance at the wounded kid, he bellowed, \u201cHow did you fall so low? What about the plan?\u201dYang Ming\u2019s face fell and shook his head, \u201cUnclear.\u201dElder Jian wanted to kick this worthless thing away, [You are the one most knowledgeable about this plan and yet you come to me saying it\u2019s unclear?][The house\u2019s expense was heavy in this decade long plan, and this is your answer?]If Elder Jian didn\u2019t need to hear the kid\u2019s report, he would\u2019ve killed him right then and there.\u201cForget it, we\u2019ll speak of it when we return.\u201d Sighing, Elder Jian\u2019s eyes turned to the stunned Lei Yuting, \u201cAfter we get rid of this girl.\u201dHe then jumped at her with a palm strike.Coming face to face with a Profound Heaven expert for the first time, Lei Yuting was frozen in fear. Under such power, she couldn\u2019t even defend.\u201cIs this the power of the Profound Heaven Stage?\u201dLei Yuting paled, rooted to her spot as she waited for the palm to take her life.Whoosh!A sudden silver flash cowered Elder Jian into retreating before the hit landed. A figure made itself notice as it walked next to Lei Yuting, striking a sinister grin, \u201cDo all elders from Hell Valley like to pick on juniors?\u201d\u201cZhuo Fan!\u201dLei Yuting cried in joy as her heart found peace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What happened to Elder Yun?\u201dGrinning, Zhuo Fan pointed Savage Moon at Elder Jian, \u201cOh, you recognize it.\u201dJian Fan\u2019s mind was in chaos, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2026 how can that old guy die at the hands of a pup? But\u2026\u201dThe more he looked at the demonic treasure, the more Jian Fan felt shock, hatred, and above all, confusion\u2026Be that as it may, but no Hell Valley\u2019s demonic treasure was allowed to fall into an outsider\u2019s hand. Elder Jian then saw the naked killing intent in Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes.Aware of the other\u2019s intention, Zhuo Fan snickered as he sent a whisper to Lei Yuting, \u201cListen, aim for the old man\u2019s heart and close your eyes as you attack with Lightning Finger. Ignore everything else!\u201dShe turned to him in shock, [How can I hit him if I close my eyes? We won\u2019t win against a Profound Heaven cultivator regardless!]But she soon recalled Zhuo Fan\u2019s unscrupulous character and understood his intention. The only reason he saved her was to use her as a live bait to throw into the jaws of death.Lei Yuting nodded despondently. She was already prepared to die when she made the decision to come here.Zhuo Fan curled his finger, making Blood Infant return to his body unnoticed as he shouted, \u201cNow!\u201dZhuo Fan went first and Lei Yuting followed his plan by closing her eyes and using Lightning Finger.Startled, Elder Jian didn\u2019t expect them to move first. But he didn\u2019t mind as a Profound Heaven cultivator\u2019s defense wasn\u2019t something a Qi Condensation cultivator could pierce. The only danger to his life was posed by that Savage Moon. As such, Zhuo Fan had his complete focus.Lei Yuting charged the lightning with her eyes closed, ignoring everything, while Zhuo Fan flitted left and right.Elder Jian sneered, turning a blind eye to the girl.When she was near Elder Jian, Zhuo Fan flashed in front of her and attacked with Savage Moon.It was a simple thing for Jian Fan to grab Zhuo Fan\u2019s hand and snap it in two.\u201cHumph, don\u2019t think a petty diversion is enough to trick my eyes. I\u2019ve lived far longer than you. Smoke and mirrors won\u2019t work on me.\u201d Jian Fan sneered.\u201cYet\u2026 it still has!\u201d Zhuo Fan\u2019s smile remained.Suddenly, Elder Jian\u2019s heart was filled with unease.Before he could make clear as to why, a red light flew from Zhuo Fan into his body.From Zhuo Fan\u2019s broken arm, blood spurted out like a stream and dyed the trees red.Jian Fan watched Zhuo Fan with rage, \u201cIt\u2026 was you back then?\u201dHe now knew what had entered his body not too long ago and allowed the three elders from Veiled Dragon Pavilion to use that chance and tear one of his arms.Zhuo Fan grinned.\u201cYou\u2019re brave, I\u2019ll give you that, to rob me of my arm!\u201d Jian Fan gnashed his teeth, \u201cOnce I get out of your demonic creature\u2019s control, I\u2019ll tear you to pieces.\u201dElder Jian focused all his Yuan Qi into his body while talking.Zhuo Fan smiled, despite sensing the increasing pressure on Blood Infant, \u201cElder Jian, you\u2019ve been tricked yet again.\u201dLightning crackled as Lei Yuting\u2019s fingers came from behind Zhuo Fan and struck Jian Fan\u2019s chest.Watching Zhuo Fan\u2019s eerie smile with doubt, Elder Jian\u2019s eyes bulged out from grievance and unwillingness to die like this.\u201cElder Jian, you were wrong. I was the distraction.\u201d Zhuo Fan smiled despite the blood leaking from his mouth, \u201cYou only paid attention to Savage Moon, but you forgot your wounded state. Weakened as you are now, you no longer have the same amount of Yuan Qi as before, ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201dThe fear in Elder Jian\u2019s eyes grew thick.[Such a cunning and vicious youth\u2026 ]\u201cHow horrifying\u2026\u201dThis was how the expert Jian Fan breathed his last breath.Zhuo Fan used himself as bait while leaving the final blow to Lei Yuting. Each step was filled with perils. The slightest mistake, the slightest hesitation would\u2019ve meant death.Yet when Zhuo Fan was involved, everything they did was as if they were dancing to his tune, resulting in Elder Jian\u2019s ultimate demise. It was especially so when Zhuo Fan blocked Elder Jian from noticing the real danger hiding behind him, Lei Yuting\u2019s Lightning Fingers.Two Qi Condensation juniors killing a Profound Heaven expert! If anyone spoke of this, none would believe it.Plop!Zhuo Fan collapsed in his own blood.Lei Yuting was crying in despair when she saw this. She thought Zhuo Fan wanted her to act as bait, but it exceeded her expectations when he took the most dangerous role onto himself.All kinds of emotions swept her heart, pain, warmth and even something Yang Ming never managed to stir.\u201cZhuo Fan, forgive me.\u201d Lei Yuting kneeled at his side, watching his pale face.Zhuo Fan waved, \u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault. When Blood Infant was wounded, I also suffered internal injuries.\u201dHe recalled Blood Infant from Elder Jian\u2019s corpse, \u201cThis time, it\u2019ll take a lot more time to heal.\u201dHis wounds mattered little when compared to Blood Infant\u2019s, which represented his life.This only worked to increase Lei Yuting\u2019s flow of tears. She now knew that the demonic creature wasn\u2019t a treasure, but something bound to his life.Yet even in such a perilous state, he chose to take a life-threatening hit for her.She began to see Zhuo Fan with different eyes, but Zhuo Fan himself couldn\u2019t care less.Zhuo Fan pointed at Jian Fan, \u201cSearch him. A Hell Valley elder has to have valuable things on him.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dLei Yuting used her highly dexterous hands to complete this task with such skill that Zhuo Fan couldn\u2019t help but raise an eyebrow, [A bandit sure is skilled.]Once Jian Fan was picked clean, Lei Yuting returned to Zhuo Fan. In her entire life, this was the first time she ever lowered her head in shame from doing something so unbecoming of her. But he couldn\u2019t care less about the reason why she was hiding her face.As she strewed the things before Zhuo Fan, she kept avoiding his eyes.Zhuo Fan found it odd but didn\u2019t care and started to rummage through Elder Jian\u2019s stuff.The first and foremost thing that caught his eye was the storage ring and soon found what he was looking for inside.A light flashed and two jade slips appeared in his hand, Lei clan\u2019s spiritual ranked martial art, Lightning Finger, and Cai clan\u2019s martial art, Wind Kick!He was clueless as to the secret involving the three clans\u2019 martial arts but did not hesitate in taking them into his own ring.What was left were some cultivation methods, martial arts and spirit stones. Zhuo Fan, as a former Demonic Emperor, couldn\u2019t care less about those and threw the ring to Lei Yuting.\u201cAccording to bandit\u2019s rule, half belongs to you.\u201dLei Yuting shook her head, \u201cThe old man was your kill. They are yours.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want them, he has nothing of value!\u201d Zhuo Fan smiled and turned his eyes to a bag.It was only as big as a palm but Zhuo Fan knew of its remarkable quality. It was a bag that could store living creatures. And what laid within was none other than the Soul Devouring Crow.Stashing it in his chest, Zhuo Fan smiled pleasantly. It held the largest interest to him. Who knew, he might even discover the secret of the Purple Lightning Gold Eye.\u201cZhuo Fan, at least take the ring.\u201dLei Yuting was shocked at the ring\u2019s contents and still decided to give it to Zhuo Fan, \u201cI know Luo clan is wealthy, but there are some spirit ranked martial arts and cultivation methods inside which are of far greater value than mere spirit stones. It will provide great help in restoring your clan.\u201dZhuo Fan shrugged as he weighed the ring, \u201cSuch trashy things I have in heaps. There\u2019s nothing rare or great about them. If you don\u2019t want it, I\u2019ll just throw it.\u201dHe was about to do just that when Lei Yuting took the ring from his hand, \u201cHow can you be such a wastrel, to not even want spirit ranked martial arts? How did you manage to become a steward anyway? With how you act, Luo clan\u2019s money will get flushed down the drain.\u201dZhuo Fan smiled as he put Jian Fan\u2019s corpse into his ring, \u201cTime to head back. Veiled Dragon Pavilion has some explaining to do.\u201dLei Yuting nodded and rushed to support him. As Zhuo Fan was far too weakened, he could only lean onto her shoulder, tinting her cheeks red in the process.\u201cWait!\u201dZhuo Fan stopped to look around, \u201cWhere\u2019s Yang Ming?\u201dLei Yuting looked everywhere but there was no sight of Yang Ming.They forgot about him in the heat of the battle.\u201cCurses, he got away.\u201d Lei Yuting gnashed her teeth.Zhuo Fan shook his head, \u201cNo need to bother with an insect.\u201dBut then he recalled his disciple, Zhao Chen, and killing intent flashed in his eyes, \u201cBut even insects can spell trouble. The next time I see him, he\u2019s dead!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even tiredness couldn\u2019t hide the prideful air they carried themselves with.Not only did they win the battle with Hell Valley, but did it spectacularly.Long Jiu, with 3rd and 5th elder, stood at the gates watching their return with negligible casualties.\u201cUncles!\u201dLong Jie and Long Kui bowed with a smile.The three elders were pleased, \u201cLittle Kui, Ah Jie, how was your fight?\u201dLong Kui was the first to report, \u201cAs the uncles predicted, after you chased the elders from Hell Valley, a large force came to attack us only to be defeated by us. Barely a scant few Bone Tempering cultivators escaped.\u201d\u201cWell done!\u201dLong Jiu shouted his approval, \u201cYour improvement has been great lately. Magnificent for you to not only lead your own team but to also wipe out the enemy.\u201d\u201cThird brother, when you return to the estate, make sure to report the two\u2019s merit to Pavilion Lord. Ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201d Long Jiu\u2019s laughter shook the air as if he was relieved of the past years\u2019 pressure.3rd elder stroked his beard with a smile. This huge merit the two achieved for Veiled Dragon Pavilion was the first in their lives.Such accomplishment was always followed by a sense of honor and pride.\u201cOh, right.\u201d3rd elder furrowed his brow, \u201cDo you know what was the cause of that tremendous explosion last night?\u201dLong Jie and Long Kui were also puzzled.\u201cThat sound shook the world and I thought it was from 3rd elder\u2019s fight with Hell Valley\u2019s elders. Wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Long Kui asked.The three elders\u2019 expression turned grave as they shook their heads.The explosion shook the hearts of everyone last night, instantly becoming a mystery as to what caused it.\u201cOh, didn\u2019t the Luo clan stay hidden in their small courtyard all this time? Let\u2019s go ask them.\u201d Long Jiu slapped his head as he turned to 3rd elder.Nodding, 3rd elder walked in the small courtyard\u2019s direction, followed by the others.Long Kui smirked, \u201cThe battle must\u2019ve been so brutal last night that a tiny clan like them were scared to even poke their heads. They probably hadn\u2019t seen anything.\u201dNone spoke while Long Jie shook his head.They clearly approved of her stance, as they were only going there to ask for clues.When they arrived before the guest room of the small courtyard, they saw Luo clan\u2019s members standing before Zhuo Fan\u2019s door with worried faces. With them were three more people and one among them was in the Profound Heaven Stage.\u201cIt can\u2019t be that\u2026 yesterday was because\u2026\u201dThe three elders were startled, hurrying to pay their respects to Lei Yuntian.\u201cMay I inquire brother\u2019s name?\u201d Long Jiu looked at him while being confused, [When did Luo clan get an expert?]Lei Yuntian returned the gesture as he knew of Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s might, \u201cI am Lei Yuntian from Blackwind Mountain. It\u2019s an honor to meet the famous Veiled Dragon Pavilion. I am fortunate to come face to face with elders!\u201dLong Jiu nodded.Having stayed in Windgaze City for so long, he knew the city had many clans with different power levels. But only the recently established Sun clan along with the previous Luo clan, Cai clan and Blackwind Mountain\u2019s Lei clan were first-rated clans.Of course, this applied to a small town like Windgaze City, not including the seven houses.As the Lei clan now had a Profound Heaven expert, the Blackwind Mountain\u2019s influence would expand like never before. Despite how Bone Tempering Stage and Profound Heaven Stage were but a stage apart, the fact that a clan had a Profound Heaven expert as overseer, it now became a second-rate clan on this continent. Those that lacked such power, were mere third-rate or fallen clans.Lei clan can now be considered as the most outstanding clan in Windgaze City.\u201cClan Head Lei, I wonder what are you\u2026\u201d Long Jiu roamed his eyes over the people gathered before Zhuo Fan\u2019s room.Lei Yuntian sighed, \u201cSteward Zhuo was hurt last night and is unclear if he will survive\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat, this place was under attack too?\u201d3rd elder was shocked. He thought that Long Jie and Long Kui had blocked all Hell Valley\u2019s men last night, but it seemed that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201cDid they prepare two teams?\u201d\u201cHumph.\u201d A sudden snort of disdain came from behind, \u201cWasn\u2019t Zhuo Fan always acting so high and mighty? Didn\u2019t he boast he\u2019d surpass the seven houses in ten years? So useless, to only end up on his death bed from a bunch of thieves!\u201dLuo clan and Lei clan all glared at the speaker, but Long Kui just rolled her eyes.\u201cQuiet, little Kui.\u201d Long Jiu shot her a glare and Long Kui was forced to remain silent.Looking apologetic toward Lei Yuntian, Long Jiu spoke, \u201cPlease excuse her rash behavior. Just who could it be, powerful enough to injure Zhuo Fan to such a state even with a Profound Heaven expert such as yourself protecting him?\u201d[What, me protecting him?]Lei Yuntian was taken aback, but then shook his head, \u201cI am ashamed to say that I only advanced last night and still lacked the power to defend Steward Zhuo.\u201dTo others, Lei Yuntian was the strongest here and it was natural for him to protect everyone. But only he was the clearest as to who protected who last night.\u201cBut the enemy was a Profound Heaven expert that called himself Elder Yun.\u201d\u201cWhat, You Yunqing?\u201d3rd elder and Long Jiu were startled as the former muttered, \u201cI never thought that he\u2019d also come.\u201dBut then he turned with joy at Lei Yuntian, \u201cBrother Lei, you\u2019re amazing. That man was one of Hell Valley\u2019s twelve elders, having entered the Profound Heaven Stage for decades. Yet you just advanced to Profound Heaven Stage and defeated him. Impressive indeed.\u201dThe other two elders also showed their admiration.Lei Yuntian blushed and said with a cough, \u201c3rd elder is exaggerating. I couldn\u2019t even take a single blow from him.\u201d\u201cThen how did you all pass the night unharmed?\u201d Long Jiu asked.Scratching his head, Lei Yuntian looked at Zhuo Fan\u2019s door, \u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to Steward Zhuo. If not for him, everyone here would\u2019ve undoubtedly perished.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying Zhuo Fan held You Yunqing back by himself, all night?\u201dEveryone was stunned, Long Kui included.\u201cB-but he\u2019s just a Qi Condensation cultivator.\u201d Long Jiu refuted.Lei Yuntian shrugged at a loss, \u201cI am clear on that, but so what?\u201dThe last words choked Long Jiu. Lei Yuntian said it as if it was a common occurrence for a Qi Condensation cultivator to fight off a Profound Heaven cultivator for an entire night.\u201cAnd?\u201d3rd elder clenched his fists, staring at Lei Yuntian, \u201cYou mean to tell us Zhuo Fan forced Elder You Yunqing into retreating?\u201d\u201cRetreat?\u201dFrowning, Lei Yuntian showed a trace of fear as he relived the last night\u2019s events, \u201cYou are underestimating Zhuo Fan far too much.\u201d[Underestimate? How?][Even if one scoured the continent, would he ever find an instance where a Qi Condensation cultivator forced a Profound Heaven expert into retreating?][We only made the most reasonable guess, yet even this is such a far fetched exaggeration that not even Zhuo Fan would believe. If not for you mentioning it, we\u2019d have never conceived such ideas.]The three elders swallowed dryly, with hearts in their throat.\u201cThe fool didn\u2019t even have time to flee, killed in one move by Zhuo Fan!\u201d Lei Yuntian sighed.\u201cWhat?\u201dThe elders were overwhelmed with shock.This was unprecedented!Long Kui and Long Jie were also dumbfounded.Long Jiu\u2019s hands began to shiver without his knowledge, \u201cAre you saying Zhuo Fan was behind the huge explosion last night? He killed a Hell Valley\u2019s Profound Heaven elder and got out with a light wound?\u201dLei Yuntian saw their eager expressions and wanted to nod, but frowned instead with a shake of his head.\u201cWhat was it then?\u201d Long Jiu was anxious and his aura leaked, forcing the others to take a few steps back.Lei Yuntian sighed, \u201cI told you not to underestimate the kid. He killed Hell Valley\u2019s elder, but not at the cost of injury. Only his Yuan Qi was depleted.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible! He came out unscathed?\u201d Long Jiu was battered with one shock after another that even he didn\u2019t know what he was saying, \u201cB-but then how did he get hurt?\u201dBam!A pale-faced Zhuo Fan slammed the door open and snapped at Long Jiu, \u201cIsn\u2019t it because of you, bro Jiu?\u201d\u201cZhuo Fan!\u201dSome were shocked, some were glad, some were amazed, but most were filled with doubts as they turned to him.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Luo Yunchang was worried.\u201cAlright my ass!\u201dZhuo Fan snorted as he glared at everyone who was present, \u201cHere I am trying to keep my life and you people had to yap on and on. You think one can get well like this?\u201dThey all started getting embarrassed and lowered their heads. Only the three elders looked at him at a loss.Zhuo Fan secretly snorted, \u201cBro Jiu, didn\u2019t you want to know how I got hurt? It\u2019s all because of him!\u201dZhuo Fan took out a cold corpse shocking them all. The ones most shocked were, of course, the three elders.\u201cCondor Jian Fan!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What manner of death could have evoked such expression from a monster who roamed the continent unhindered?\u201cH-how? Condor Jian Fan is actually dead. W-who killed him?\u201d Long Jiu was unnerved and stammered.Zhuo Fan sneered, \u201cIs there a need to ask when I was the one who took out his corpse?\u201dThey all looked at Zhuo Fan with a stranger\u2019s eyes. Each guessed as such, but none dared to believe it.This monster had even escaped the Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s three elders\u2019 joint attack!\u201cI knew that there was a deep grudge between him and bro Jiu. Since I chanced upon him, I killed him.\u201d Flicking off imaginary dust from himself, Zhuo Fan smiled, \u201cBro Jiu, please don\u2019t take offense from meddling in your affairs.\u201d\u201cH-how can I?\u201dLong Jiu panted and was staring at the corpse with bloodshot eyes, \u201cThis monster ruined my eye and my future. I can hardly contain myself from drinking his blood and feasting on his flesh. How can I blame you for taking revenge in my stead?\u201d\u201cBrother Zhuo.\u201dSuddenly, Long Jiu cupped his hands, \u201cFrom this day forth, I shall treat you as a sworn brother. As long as you\u2019re in my domain, you just need to ask and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\u201cSigh, bro Jiu is too courteous. I barely did anything.\u201dZhuo Fan dismissed him with a wave, but that little movement stirred his wound and winced. Long Jiu appeared next to him in a flash, \u201cDon\u2019t move brother, here are some Recovery Pills. In three days you\u2019ll be up and about.\u201dLong Jiu took out a few small bottles and placed them in Zhuo Fan\u2019s hand.With how caring Long Jiu was, the other elders stared at Zhuo Fan in amazement. Long Kui pouted, feeling her heart dumped in vinegar.They just wiped out Hell Valley\u2019s men and earned great merit that even the three elders were overjoyed, yet it paled in comparison with Zhuo Fan, who killed two of Hell Valley\u2019s elders.\u201cHumph, who knows what trick he pulled to get so lucky and snatch their heads. How could a Qi Condensation cultivator ever kill a Profound Heaven expert?\u201dLong Kui muttered in jealousy, but everyone heard her.3rd elder glared but then shook his head.Yet Zhuo Fan laughed, \u201cIt is true that it was by luck that I encountered the one-armed elder and got his head, bad luck in fact. Because I had just then killed a Profound Heaven expert and was out of Yuan Qi. But this also made him underestimate me. How else could I have killed the wounded Elder Jian?\u201d\u201cIf it were any other time, wouldn\u2019t the elder kill me with but a wave of his hand? Sigh, last night I had the worst luck. Unlike some people, who only had to lead their men to ensure their safety\u2026\u201d Zhuo Fan sighed as Long Kui\u2019s face flushed red.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dLei Yuting giggled.She was clear on what happened last night. Zhuo Fan was indeed amazing, forcing the elder to act as he wanted. But amazing as he was, such an instance wasn\u2019t going to repeat itself every time.Zhuo Fan said that just to spite Long Kui.[I am better and stronger than you. My merit is also greater, all coming from one well-placed hit. While you can only yap your mouth\u2026 ]The three elders laughed as they shook their heads.They knew that Zhuo Fan succeeded in bringing down a Profound Heaven expert only through special means and not like how he bragged about, killing because he met him.But the fact remained, him killing two such experts in a single night shook the elders\u2019 core.\u201cOld Jiu, take care of brother Zhuo\u2019s wound. We will also add a few hundred guards around the premises while I and brother Wu report back to the estate. We must notify Pavilion Lord.\u201dLong Jiu nodded while Long Kui and Long Jie froze, [Why even 3rd elder is calling Zhuo Fan brother?]Zhuo Fan adapted to the change on the spot, \u201cBro San, bro Wu, take care!\u201dStumbling, 3rd and 5th elders shook their heads in dismay.[Old Jiu was right, this kid\u2019s greatest talent is to read hearts.]After they left, Long Jiu and the others helped Zhuo Fan back to his room. Long Jie and Long Kui left to handle the additional security of the small courtyard.In bed, Zhuo Fan eased his breathing and asked, \u201cEveryone leave, I have to talk with bro Jiu alone.\u201dAs the people left, Long Jiu was wondering what could Zhuo Fan want to know so urgently.\u201cBro Jiu, I have a gift for you.\u201d\u201cGift?\u201d Long Jiu only laughed, \u201cBrother, I\u2019m not trying to discourage you, but the Luo clan hasn\u2019t got anything I could take interest in! Or is it that you have another ancient array?\u201dZhuo Fan shook his head, \u201cIn your dreams! That array alone is worth ten million at the minimum. Do you think they\u2019re easy to come by? But I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re going to like this gift.\u201dZhuo Fan took out a bag.Frowning, Long Jiu didn\u2019t understand until Zhuo Fan opened the bag and a crow landed on his shoulder.\u201cJian Fan\u2019s Soul Devouring Crow?\u201d\u201cCorrect.\u201d\u201cEver since that old guy died, this crow has been without an owner. I\u2019m sure bro Jiu wouldn\u2019t need long to turn it into your spirit animal, always there to protect you.\u201dLong Jiu\u2019s eyes began to glisten.The title of Godeye Long Jiu lost all it\u2019s power ever since his eye was robbed. Now that he had the crow, it was as if he recovered his mystic eye.\u201cBrother, thank you for your kind intention.\u201d Long Jiu\u2019s eye trembled from the heartfelt gratitude.Zhuo Fan continued, \u201cBro Jiu, there\u2019s just one thing I am unclear about. Since you trained one eye in Purple Lightning Gold Eye, why couldn\u2019t you do the same for the other?\u201d\u201cSigh, brother, this mystic eye of mine was gained through a chance encounter. A once in a lifetime opportunity.\u201d Long Jiu sighed recalling his youth.\u201cThis mystic eye wasn\u2019t cultivated through a cultivation method from Veiled Dragon Pavilion. It was something I found through luck.\u201dLong Jiu considered Zhuo Fan as one of his closest friends. Thus, he became the first listener to this secret Long Jiu had buried for such a long time, \u201cBrother, do you know of the three danger zones on this continent?\u201dAfter Zhuo Fan shook his head, Long Jiu smiled, \u201cYou can go anywhere you want across the continent, except for the three danger zones. Regardless of your strength, you\u2019ll find helpless against the dangers in there.\u201dZhuo Fan nodded from how serious Long Jiu looked but didn\u2019t take the warning to heart.\u201cThe zones are Lightning Canyon, Ice Mountain and Fire Pit!\u201dLong Jiu stared at Zhuo Fan in all seriousness, but then laughed in the end, \u201cNever mind, even if you want to go you still can\u2019t. Only if your luck is sky-high will you enter one.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause these zones appear at random. Today, they might be in the East and tomorrow in the West. Regardless of where they descend, it will cause a terrible tornado that draws in all who dared approach, while also trapping them inside.\u201d[That must be an array which an expert had deployed. If one didn\u2019t know how the array operated, they would have no hope of finding the entrance.]Zhuo Fan asked, \u201cThen how did you get out?\u201dLong Jiu nodded with a deep look, \u201cYou\u2019re smart, brother. Yes, in my youth I chanced upon the Lightning Canyon.\u201d\u201cAt that time, the tornado swept me away and all I could see was a world of purple lightning. Every single expert there fell under the purple strikes. Just recalling it sends shivers down my spine. Then the oddest thing happened. The strike that was meant for me hit in my eye. While I was unharmed, all that I could feel from my eye was scorching heat.\u201dZhuo Fan now understood.As it was stated in the Nine Serenities Secret Records regarding the Heavenly Emperor\u2019s Purple Lightning Gold Eye, everything was subjected to be destroyed under its gaze, all except the eye. This was why when the purple lightning struck Long Jiu\u2019s eye, he was unharmed.\u201cPerhaps because of my will to survive, I gave it my all in fighting for my life. I was aware of the purple lightning\u2019s power but still wanted to live. It was at that moment that a man\u2019s voice reached me. He was reciting some method and I, in my confused state, mimicked his words. It shocked me in the end when my eye released purple lightning.\u201d\u201cIt may have been because of the eye that the purple lightning no longer struck me. Finally, when the tornado passed, only I survived. But ever since I was robbed of my eye and because of the frantic situation when I gained it, I no longer recalled the words that man recited and had no way of forming another mystic eye.\u201dLong Jiu sighed while Zhuo Fan nodded.Lightning Canyon was a remnant the Heavenly Emperor left behind and contained his cultivation method. [I have to find it. If I add the Nine Serenities Emperor\u2019s legacy with Heavenly Emperor\u2019s, with two of the three ancient Emperors\u2019 legacy in my hands, none can contest me!][I didn\u2019t reincarnate in vain!][No one would ever imagine that a powerful Emperor Stage expert would leave his remnant in the mortal world. Ha-ha-ha\u2026]Zhuo Fan wanted to cackle but was sensible enough to refrain since Long Jiu was next to him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 - ResistingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTheir talk took the entire day. Once Zhuo Fan got hold of all the information that interested him, he walked Long Jiu out after which he entered seclusion for a month to heal.With Long Jiu\u2019s Recovery Pills, he was back to full health in ten days but was forced to spend the remaining time to patch up Blood Infant\u2019s precarious state.A month later, Zhuo Fan came out of his room stretching his limbs and enjoying the fresh air. Moreover, just a few days ago, he and Blood Infant entered the 5th layer of Qi Condensation.Just that it was a pity one of the two elders from Hell Valley died for naught. He truly hoped he could absorb the elder\u2019s Yuan Qi at the time.With it, he\u2019d be in the Bone Tempering Stage by now.\u201cAh, Steward Zhuo\u2026\u201dXiao Cui shrieked in joy seeing him but then bolted.Zhuo Fan was stumped, feeling his face unconsciously. [Did something change about me? Why did she run as soon as she saw me?][What\u2019s so scary about me? I\u2019m not a man-eating monster.]But he soon had it all figured out.[I must\u2019ve been too rough on her when I ripped their clothes that time and this girl is now afraid of me. The same as how Luo Yunhai was before.]Zhuo Fan snickered, [I was kinda too hard on both the kids.]\u201cBrother Zhuo, are you feeling better?\u201dThis time it was the uncouth Captain Pang.\u201cOld Pang!\u201dCaptain Pang was the only one he admitted being his friend since he reincarnated. Zhuo Fan started to miss him after not seeing each other for a month.However, just as Captain Pang was about to give him a friendly hug, his face changed and away he ran.This time, Zhuo Fan was floored.[Forget that lass, Xiao Cui, why is even Old Pang avoiding me like a plague?]Zhuo Fan frowned, unable to get to the bottom of it.He was expert in reading people\u2019s intentions in negotiations and fights, but that was because he was convinced every man\u2019s actions were motivated by benefit.Yet Old Pang\u2019s behavior had him stumped.[I\u2019ve done nothing to hurt him and he shouldn\u2019t have a reason for being scared of me. Then what\u2019s the deal with him running away?]Zhuo Fan shook his head in puzzlement but he wasn\u2019t in the mood to find out the reason. A man such as Demonic Emperor was a man of great action, not bothered by petty affairs.When he was about to leave, Lei Yuting appeared in his sight with a lunch box and Xiao Cui running behind her.Her cute body hid behind Lei Yuting, peeking her small head to gaze at Zhuo Fan.\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d Zhuo Fan stood in place, puzzled.Lei Yuting walked with unsure steps, unlike the usual decisive nature she carried herself with. When she looked at Zhuo Fan, her cheeks were rosy, \u201cUm, Steward Zhuo, thank you for saving me. Please accept this small token of appreciation.\u201dZhuo Fan eyed the lunch box with suspicion as he eased the lid open.A wonderful smell swept him when the intricately made dishes prepared from the heart were in the open.\u201cWhat a wonderful smell!\u201dZhuo Fan asked, \u201cWhere did you buy them from? Did Windgaze City have such a great restaurant?\u201d\u201cHumph, they weren\u2019t bought.\u201d Xiao Cui jumped out with a smile, \u201cYoung miss spent ten hours each day making them and waited for Steward Zhuo to come out of seclusion to try them out!\u201d[Every day?]Zhuo Fan now unraveled the mystery of Xiao Cui running at the sight of him. It was to notify Lei Yuting.Not knowing when he\u2019d come out, Lei Yuting cooked for him every day. Her perseverance moved him.Nodding, Zhuo Fan spoke, \u201cI accept your gift.\u201dLei Yuting cupped her blushing face and whispered, \u201cSteward Zhuo just got well and needs to take care of his body. Hurry and eat before it gets cold.\u201d\u201cRight!\u201dZhuo Fan returned to his room with the lunch box. Even though he was in the Qi Condensation Stage, not eating for a month made him hungry.Lei Yuting with Xiao Cui in tow followed him in. Her eyes shined like the sun, soft yet warm enough to melt a glacier.When Zhuo Fan was about to dig in, Luo Yunchang\u2019s charming figure entered the room with a knock. Captain Pang followed behind her.Quirking an eyebrow, Zhuo Fan saw her carrying a lunch box too.\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know Steward Zhuo already had someone bringing him breakfast. I was worried for nothing.\u201dWhen she saw the lunch box in front Zhuo Fan, Luo Yunchang\u2019s smile widened but her eyes became sharp as if they were about to poke holes into everyone present.\u201cWhat got her in such a foul mood this morning?\u201d Zhuo Fan flickered his brow in confusion. But when he picked up on Captain Pang\u2019s pitying glance, it got him baffled.Bam!Luo Yunchang slammed the box in front of Zhuo Fan while squeezing a smile, \u201cSteward Zhuo, this is something I made for you to help in your recovery.\u201d\u201cI already have a share. I\u2019m not a glutton to eat so much.\u201dZhuo Fan shrugged, planning on pushing aside Luo Yunchang\u2019s box but then he sensed killing intent. He caught Luo Yunchang\u2019s eyes glaring at him.\u201cUm, I\u2019ll try both of them.\u201dZhuo Fan flinched for the first time in his life. He didn\u2019t understand what the fuss was about but knew that if he hadn\u2019t said that, there would have been a real danger to his life.Revealing Luo Yunchang\u2019s dishes, he found them scorched black, cutting most of his appetite.\u201cUm, I think I\u2019ll eat this one.\u201dZhuo Fan went for Lei Yuting\u2019s box as she showed a bright smile.But even before his hand reached it, Luo Yunchang bumped her box closer to him with a glare, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you\u2019ll eat them both?\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s brow flickered, hesitation setting in as he took another long look at Luo Yunchang\u2019s burnt dishes.But he could hardly refuse her sincere eyes and nodded, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll eat them.\u201dLuo Yunchang broke out into a wide smile, to which Lei Yuting was showing disdain.\u201cMine first.\u201d Luo Yunchang urged.\u201cNo, mine.\u201d Lei Yuting said in haste.The two women\u2019s eyes met and sparks seemed to fly.Zhuo Fan wondered, [Weren\u2019t they close? Why are they fighting all of a sudden?] He couldn\u2019t comprehend what could bring such a change in them.\u201cFirst come, first served.\u201dZhuo Fan then took a bite out of Lei Yuting\u2019s dishes. She was staring at him with wide and expectant eyes.Zhuo Fan gave a thumbs up, \u201cDelicious!\u201dLei Yuting\u2019s smile bloomed like a flower while Xiao Cui pushed out her chin and shouted, \u201cMy Young miss started cooking since she was ten. No one in Windgaze City can match her skill. You are fortunate today, Steward Zhuo.\u201dXiao Cui\u2019s boast embarrassed Lei Yuting, but even that couldn\u2019t take away the radiant smile from her face.Luo Yunchang pouted, \u201cZhuo Fan, try mine.\u201dZhuo Fan took a bite but spat it out as soon as it touched his tongue.\u201cEven poison is better.\u201d His words were sharp as he took Lei Yuting\u2019s box, \u201cI still choose this one.\u201dLei Yuting was smiling, while Luo Yunchang\u2019s eyes started tearing.\u201cWow, such a great smell!\u201dAt this time Luo Yunhai shouted in surprise as he jumped into Zhuo Fan\u2019s room, \u201cBro Zhuo, you\u2019re out! And you are having such a feast, why didn\u2019t you invite me?\u201d\u201cGo and eat your sister\u2019s cooking.\u201d Zhuo Fan dissed him.Luo Yunhai complained, \u201cHer skill isn\u2019t worth a dime. She doesn\u2019t know anything besides opening the kitchen door.\u201dUnable to stay there any longer, Luo Yunchang ran out with her lunch box. But people could see the droplets she left behind on the floor.\u201cUm, was I wrong?\u201d Luo Yunhai was confused.\u201cNot at all.\u201d Zhuo Fan gorged on Lei Yuting\u2019s cooking as he said, \u201cBut some people have low confidence.\u201dAfter finishing his meal, Zhuo Fan informed the others before leaving, \u201cStay here as Hell Valley\u2019s people might still lurk around. I\u2019m going to pay Veiled Dragon Pavilion a visit.\u201dLuo Yunhai and Captain Pang nodded then turned to Lei Yuting. Seeing her all flushed, Xiao Cui was even more excited, \u201cHow great, Young miss, Steward Zhuo is interested in you.\u201dLei Yuting only smiled.At the same time, in the Imperial City.In a magnificent office, two people sat side by side. One man was in his forties, dressed in a white silken robe. He had a small hanging mustache that shook with his smile.The other man was in his fifties, with a somber complexion and wearing a dark cloak. His pair of large eyes were filled with grievance.The two acted like strangers, not meeting each other\u2019s eyes.Cough, cough, cough\u2026With a cough, a shaky body appeared before the two. It was an old man dressed in a golden robe embroidered with nine dragons.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201dThe men rose up and bowed.The elder waved for them to sit, \u201cVeiled Dragon Pavilion and Hell Valley both are from the Seven Noble Houses, the pillars of the empire. What matter has made you request an audience with me?\u201dThis elder was the Emperor of Tianyu Empire!\u201cYour Majesty, Veiled Dragon Pavilion killed two of our Hell Valley\u2019s elders last month, breaking the seven houses\u2019 agreement. Your Majesty, please punish the Veiled Dragon Pavilion!\u201d The black-robed man complained.Sneering, the middle-aged man spoke, \u201cYou Wanshan, you have some nerve complaining first! Your Hell Valley\u2019s elder infringed upon my Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s domain. How are you going to explain it? Who is it that broke the seven houses agreement first?\u201d\u201cOne of my valley\u2019s disciple, You Quan, was killed in Windgaze City. Can\u2019t I send an elder to bring the matter to light?\u201d You Wanshan squinted, \u201cLong Yifey, you are just making an excuse to exact revenge for what happened two decades ago.\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, and? Twenty years ago, you trapped Elder Jiu in Drifting Leaves City and ruined his mystic eye. You accused him of entering your domain and breaching the seven houses agreement, I didn\u2019t object. This time, however, it is your elder who entered mine. And not just one, but four! Is this what you call investigation?\u201d\u201cEnough!\u201dThe Emperor\u2019s cold shout came as his eyes flashed in anger, \u201cBoth sides are in violation. This is my judgment. Veiled Dragon Pavilion shall withdraw from Windgaze City, it is no longer part of your domain. Hell Valley and Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s people are never to set foot in this city ever again.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty!\u201dThe two cupped their fists, but the Emperor flicked his sleeve, \u201cThis matter is settled, withdraw. I no longer want to hear anything about the seven houses, nor about internal disputes.\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201dNone of them was willing to accept this conclusion but retreated nonetheless.When they were gone, the Emperor\u2019s eyes flashed, \u201cFor Hell Valley\u2019s people to enter Windgaze City, they must be privy to the thousand-year-old secret.\u201d\u201cThe Imperial City has always been a place of conflict, filled with the eyes and ears of every faction. This should be known to Your Majesty.\u201d An aged voice replied from behind.The Emperor chuckled, \u201cIt seems\u2026 the plan has begun. Pearls will always shine, he-he-he\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 - A Stubborn FattyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySince the Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s grand gate was but a few hundred steps away, Zhuo Fan chose to walk.However, he stopped before passing through it.In front of the gate was a yellow palanquin with four peak Qi Condensation cultivators as carriers and 16 Bone Tempering cultivators surrounding it.A fat figure in yellow stood in front of the palanquin. You could barely make out his pin-sized eyes from his bulging cheeks. At first glance, one would take him as having a bun in place of his head.Zhuo Fan shook his head. He\u2019d seen his fair share of people, but this was his first encountering such a fatso.[How can one get so fat?]Zhuo Fan resumed his gait, glancing at the fatty from time to time. His appearance was far from attractive, but his 7th Qi Condensation cultivation and the large number of guards was nothing to scoff.If the fatty was from Veiled Dragon Pavilion, he\u2019d have gone in by now.\u201cWait!\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s entry was stopped by a sudden shout. Turning around, he caught the sight of fatty\u2019s feet sinking into the ground with each step towards him.Zhuo Fan\u2019s cheek started twitching, \u201cDo you\u2026 need something?\u201d\u201cHe-he-he, are you from Veiled Dragon Pavilion?\u201dThe fatty smiled. It would\u2019ve been better if he hadn\u2019t, as his eyes were now gone for good.Zhuo Fan was shocked by such a baffling appearance for a moment, \u201cI\u2019m just a guest.\u201d\u201cEh, that means you can also enter.\u201d The fatty showed a warm smile, \u201cCan I ask brother\u2019s help with a small matter? Please send word to Young miss Long Kui. She hasn\u2019t come out for a whole day and I had to sleep outside.\u201d[This weird fatty is pursuing Long Kui.]Zhuo Fan wanted to laugh, but he couldn\u2019t, not when there were so many people around. [To think that haughty Long Kui knows this fellow.]Setting aside his status, his weight alone would make her awkward if someone caught them together.\u201cAlright, I will tell her right away.\u201d Zhuo Fan struggled not to laugh as the fatty cupped his hands in gratitude, \u201cI\u2019ll leave it to brother.\u201dZhuo Fan hastened his pace in fear of laughing if he spent one more moment with this guy. It wasn\u2019t worth it offending a great faction for such a reason.He soon arrived at the meeting room and met Long Kui, \u201cMiss Kui, long time no see. How have you been?\u201d\u201cGreat, until you showed up.\u201d Long Kui snorted. Zhuo Fan didn\u2019t mind it, \u201cWhere\u2019s bro Jiu, I want to speak with him.\u201d\u201cOut!\u201d Long Kui rolled her eyes.Zhuo Fan read her face and found that she didn\u2019t lie. Since he didn\u2019t see Long Jie either, it meant that he must be with Long Jiu on business.This would put a delay on the things he wanted to know. But he still had that fatty\u2019s message to deliver. [To get that guy\u2019s gratitude and support, all I have to do is make this smug girl see him. What\u2019s the harm in passing the time while embarrassing this missy while I\u2019m at it?]Zhuo Fan showed a wide grin.\u201cWhat\u2019s with you?\u201d Long Kui frowned.\u201cOh, nothing. There\u2019s a rich handsome guy outside who wants to talk to you. Hurry up and see him before he\u2019s gone.\u201d\u201cHey, Miss Long, who\u2019s he?\u201d Zhuo Fan elbowed her with raised eyebrows.Long Kui knew Zhuo Fan was making fun of her and got angry. Ignoring him, she walked to the gates with Zhuo Fan laughing behind her.\u201cDamn fatty, haven\u2019t I rejected your marriage proposal already? What are you still doing here?\u201dThe fatty\u2019s smile fell.\u201cSister Long Kui, that happened when I was ten. Now I\u2019m twenty. Don\u2019t you feel anything after I proposed a thousand times these past ten years?\u201d\u201cOf course I have, annoyance!\u201dZhuo Fan butted in at this point, patting the fatty\u2019s shoulder as he looked at Long Kui, \u201cMiss Long Kui, such tender and strong love are rare these days. My dear friend is so smitten by you that he even slept outside waiting for you.\u201dThe last words almost made Zhuo Fan burst in laughter. The fatty was so touched that the thick sarcasm flew right past him.Long Kui saw them working in unison, one explaining while the other agreeing, and felt her anger peaking. But for some reason, she changed to a charming smile.Even Zhuo Fan blanked out from seeing her smile like this for the first time. And there was no need to mention the drooling fatty.Long Kui felt sick inside but still maintained her composure, \u201cBrother Cong, you\u2019ve always treated me so well ever since we were little. But my heart belongs to another\u2026 \u201c\u201cWhat, who\u2019s the punk?\u201d The fatty\u2019s face changed and his eyes spat fire.Zhuo Fan thought, [Uh-oh. She isn\u2019t planning on dragging me into this is she?]Yet Long Kui turned to him with an enigmatic smile.[Oh. Hell.]Zhuo Fan didn\u2019t know which faction the fatty belonged to, but one thing was clear, he wasn\u2019t to be provoked. Zhuo Fan already had Hell Valley as his enemy and messing with another faction just as strong, if not stronger, then even Demonic Emperor would have a hard time turning disaster into an opportunity.\u201cI was wondering why you are able to enter Veiled Dragon Pavilion like you own the place. It was because you and Long Kui are\u2026\u201d The fatty grabbed Zhuo Fan\u2019s collar and glared.Zhuo Fan denied, \u201cBrother, it\u2019s all just a misunderstanding\u2026\u201dHowever, the fatty\u2019s eyes were red from anger and blinded to reason. There were two things any man would go berserk from, having his father killed and wife stolen. But the latter caused way more outrage than the former.Feeling as if he was wearing such a hat with no rime or reason turned this misunderstanding into a conflict.Zhuo Fan sighed, [Now I have to ask Long Jiu to explain in order to avoid offending another power.]He was pondering on how to do it when he was floored by fatty\u2019s next words.\u201cSister Kui, what do you not like about me? Does this punk have something that I don\u2019t?\u201dZhuo Fan almost spat blood, watching the fatty in a daze, \u201cBrother, now I know why you proposed a thousand times.\u201dCocky people, he has seen aplenty, but this was Zhuo Fan\u2019s first time meeting one as oblivious about himself as this guy.Watching the fatty, who could burrow the earth just by standing, Zhuo Fan wanted to shout, [Brother, it\u2019s more like you pack something way extra than me!]Even Long Kui was silently rolling her eyes.\u201cBrother Cong, there must be some other reason for you to be here. You do not have the luxury of leaving the Imperial Capital as you wish. Take care of your matters and stop wasting time.\u201d\u201cThat is out of the question. You are my future wife. I even applied for this task just to see you. Yet\u2026\u201dThen the fatty glared at Zhuo Fan.\u201cLet\u2019s duel!\u201dHe pointed at Zhuo Fan\u2019s nose as he raged, \u201cWe will duel today to settle Sister Kui\u2019s groom.\u201dZhuo Fan took a closer look at the fatty, secretly admiring him, [This kid is the first who didn\u2019t shout out his glorious clan\u2019s name before me.]Just from this, Zhuo Fan liked him.Hearing the fatty request a duel, one of his guard stepped forward, \u201cYoung Master, your body is too precious to participate in duels! It\u2019s best if you let me handle him\u2026\u201d\u201cQuiet!\u201dThe fatty interrupted the guard, \u201cIt is I who want to marry Sister Kui. My honor and dignity as a man are on the line. If you fight, I\u2019ll be mocked forever and Sister Kui will despise me even more!\u201d[I will never ever approve of you!] Long Kui rolled her eyes.Zhuo Fan agreed with a grin, \u201cWell said, I accept. However, all your guards are stronger than me and I can\u2019t take even a single hit from them if they interfere.\u201d\u201cIf I say we will duel, then it will be one on one. My word is gold. You don\u2019t believe me?\u201d The fatty was even angrier now.Zhuo Fan shook his head, \u201cI do believe you. But if I defeat you, can they hold themselves from not jumping in? At that point, even if you order them not to, it won\u2019t do much good.\u201dIt was unknown if the fatty was pondering or fuming since his eyes disappeared when he squinted. But then he barked at the guards, \u201cAll of you stay put. If anyone has the nerve to move, I\u2019ll kill him.\u201dThen he turned to Zhuo Fan, \u201cPick a location where we won\u2019t be disturbed.\u201dZhuo Fan smiled while Long Kui frowned and blocked him, \u201cYou truly intend to fight? If he gets hurt, even Veiled Dragon Pavilion can\u2019t help you.\u201dHe just nodded, \u201cThis fatty isn\u2019t bad.\u201dLong Kui was stunned.When the fatty saw them stick together, his heart was aflame from rage, panting with each word, he declared, \u201cPunk, you\u2019ll see. I will mop the floor with you.\u201dZhuo Fan smiled, not minding it in the least\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Since Long Kui was afraid of mishaps she also went along, but Zhuo Fan already had Blood Infant keep an eye out.At least the fatty\u2019s order worked like a charm and the guards stayed behind.Zhuo Fan clapped, \u201cFatty I praise you for not using the guards.\u201d\u201cHumph, I am always true to my word. This is related to me and Sister Kui\u2019s happy marriage. I will have to beat you, pesky puck, so thorough you can\u2019t contest my victory. Or who knows what excuse you\u2019ll use later to pester Sister Kui.\u201d The fatty jutted out his chin.Smiling, Zhuo Fan showed his vicious side, \u201cAren\u2019t you worried I laid an ambush?\u201dThe fatty frowned. His pin-sized eyes scoured his surroundings as he roared, \u201cHumph, I am willing to venture alone against any adversity, but if you think Sister Kui will look kindly to such a despicable punk, think again. No matter what you have in store, I will never lose!\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, enough with the heroism. Kid, I like you. It\u2019s time we get this duel started.\u201d Zhuo Fan smiled.Yet even before he finished, a punch came his way.Zhuo Fan rushed to dodge, but he was too late to react. His body flew and his right cheek was now red and swollen.\u201cHey fatso, I thought you were an honorable man!\u201d Zhuo Fan snapped at the nonchalant fatty who replied, \u201cDidn\u2019t you just give start to the duel? All is fair in love and war.\u201dZhuo Fan took a long look at him and secretly nodded.[This kid is more cunning than he lets on, yet he conducts himself with honor. He is as honest as Old Pang but that is where the similarities end.]Compared to the simple Old Pang, Zhuo Fan liked the shrewd fatty more.A demonic cultivator would use any means to reach his goal. This fatty, who bent the limits of morality, was more to Zhuo Fan\u2019s liking.\u201cHa-ha-ha, you\u2019re right!\u201d Zhuo Fan cackled and pointed at Long Kui, \u201cFatty, look, Long Kui is undressing!\u201dThe fatty could spot a lie when he heard one, but he still bought it this time and turned towards Long Kui\u2019s direction.Bam!Zhuo Fan used this chance to kick the fatty into the air.\u201cBastard!\u201dLong Kui fumed at the sideline with a red face, yet the culprit didn\u2019t mind it in the least when her glare focused on him.\u201cWretched punk, you dared sully Sister Kui\u2019s honor. I will show you!\u201d The fatty wobbled as he got to his feet but his eyes burned hotter than ever.Zhuo Fan dissed him, \u201cI was just messing around, yet you looked anyway. Weren\u2019t you also thinking something shameful about our Young miss Long?\u201dThe fatty gasped.Never had he heard this kind of counter before. Zhuo Fan might have disrespected Long Kui but didn\u2019t he himself sully his goddess by imagining something inappropriate? If so, did he have the right to blame Zhuo Fan?Fatty\u2019s resentment was gone just like that and he even felt ashamed. But once he imagined Long Kui changing clothes, his face went beet-red. His small eyes were perfect in hiding his secret stare over Long Kui\u2019s enticing figure.But she found him out nonetheless and stared him down with killing intent.When a shiver crawled up his spine, the fatty focused on the fight, \u201cPunk, I will let this matter slide. Time to get serious.\u201dThe fatty\u2019s body gave out a golden shine and even the ground started cracking around him.\u201cHigh mortal ranked martial art, Mountain Shaking Punch!\u201dThe fatty darted towards Zhuo Fan like a raging bull, cracking each and every stone he set his foot on.\u201cPunk, better dodge. But if you do, admit your loss!\u201dGrinning, Zhuo Fan extended a red palm, not intimidated in the least.The fatty raved, \u201cDamn punk, this will be your funeral! I am at the 7th layer of Qi Condensation and using a high ranked martial art. This is not a move which a 5th layer Qi Condensation punk can withstand!\u201d\u201cIf you treasure your life, dodge!\u201dBut Zhuo Fan didn\u2019t budge.The fatty didn\u2019t wish for the worst outcome and wanted to hold back some of his power, but it was too late now. His flabby body was already upon Zhuo Fan.Boom!Something strange happened. The weak-looking Zhuo Fan was still standing as a breeze ruffled his hair.The fatty, however, had his golden light scattered thanks to the red glow and was sent flying.He hit the ground in a daze and even as he got up, he still couldn\u2019t shake his astonishment.\u201cHow can this be? I am clearly stronger so why was I the one who got pushed back?\u201d He needed a long time to recover from the shock.Long Kui scoffed.She didn\u2019t like Zhuo Fan one bit, but that didn\u2019t stop her from admiring his strength and ability. After all, he was the first on the continent to have killed two Profound Heaven expert while being a Qi Condensation cultivator.Arriving next to fatty, Zhuo Fan offered his hand with a smile, \u201cFatty, I know you went easy on me.\u201dThe fatty sighed, \u201cA loss is a loss. Using all my power against someone weaker is the same as loosing. I am an upright man. This is your win.\u201dZhuo Fan turned serious, \u201cYou might take it as being upright, but I see it as kindness.\u201dThe fatty looked closer at Zhuo Fan. He was amazed this man found out his intention in that split second.\u201cI see now why Sister Kui likes you!\u201dThe fatty praised him and took Zhuo Fan\u2019s hand. He went to Long Kui and sighed, \u201cSister Kui, you\u2019ve found a great man. This punk will turn into a monster one day.\u201dThe fatty felt dejected.But a sudden sound broke the silence.Zhuo Fan squinted his eyes and pushed the fatty to the ground. A green light passed above them the next second, cutting all the trees in its path.The fatty looked up at Zhuo Fan with gratitude, \u201cBrother, thank you for saving me. I never thought that my love rival will become my savior.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too early for thanks. Here they come.\u201d Zhuo Fan frowned as he helped the fatty up. Long Kui also ran next to them.A dozen men appeared around the three of them the next moment, each giving off the energy of a Bone Tempering expert.\u201cWhat now?\u201dLong Kui\u2019s expression was grave as she looked at Zhuo Fan. With the Veiled Dragon Pavilion being even farther than the fatty\u2019s guards, the only one she could turn for help was the guy she disliked the most. But he was also the one most likely to pull off a miracle.The fatty strode out from between the two with confidence, \u201cIt\u2019s me you\u2019re after. Let them go.\u201d\u201cHi-hi-hi, as a member of the imperial family you sure have the air of a King. But too bad we can\u2019t leave any witnesses.\u201d A man stood out from the group, he was their leader.The fatty was filled with hatred.Suddenly, Zhuo Fan kicked the fatty with a snicker, \u201cThis fatty is under my care. If you want to kill him, you\u2019ll have to go through me first.\u201dThe dozen men laughed.\u201cA mere Qi Condensation insect wants to act tough?\u201d\u201cSince they\u2019ll all die anyway, let\u2019s start with him.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s best we kill the fatty first and complete the mission. It was hard enough finding this opportunity after waiting for so long. We can\u2019t let it go to waste\u2026\u201dAs they were rambling on and on, the fatty whispered to Zhuo Fan, \u201cBrother, they\u2019re after me. I will run towards East while you take Sister Kui back to Veiled Dragon Pavilion.\u201dZhuo Fan shook his head, \u201cWith your speed, you won\u2019t even last one second.\u201d\u201cWhat other choice do we have?\u201d Asked the fatty flustered.Zhuo Fan hardened his tone and said, \u201cSlaughter them all!\u201dHe took a step and reached their leader as Savage Moon flashed in his hand.\u201cDemonic treasure?\u201dThe leader was shocked and wanted to dodge, but a red light entered his body and froze his movements.Whoosh!With a silver flash, a head trailed the sky followed by a fountain of blood. Only Zhuo Fan stood in the pool of blood with cruel eyes.For the first time in fatty\u2019s life, his eyes bulged out from his chubby face, becoming larger than ever\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 - SlaughterPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe silence was deafening!Everyone watched slack-jawed at the unfolding event. No one there could\u2019ve imagined a Qi Condensation kid blindsiding them, who were Bone Tempering experts, and even killing one in a single hit.All the mockery and disdain they had for Zhuo Fan was now replaced with extreme caution.Fatty was still out of it, staring at Zhuo Fan like his brain was on the fritz. It finally dawned upon him that it wasn\u2019t him who held back the most in their duel, but Zhuo Fan.\u201cKill the punk first!\u201dWith a sudden shout, the men charged at Zhuo Fan together. They were now of one mind, no longer of a different opinion. They had to kill this dreadful and sinister punk first. If they were to leave him for later, they were sure they\u2019d have to pay a steep price, even if they outnumbered him.They had long forgotten their main objective and were now pointing their weapons at the punk who was holding Savage Moon and standing in a pool of blood.Smiling wryly, Zhuo Fan snickered, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have it any other way!\u201dThe next moment, he jumped at the first enemy. The man was startled and rushed to retreat. Even if Zhuo Fan was just in the Qi Condensation Stage and unable to hurt him, the 3rd-grade demonic treasure would cut through him like butter.Their leader got such a miserable death for underestimating Zhuo Fan and he wasn\u2019t willing to make the same mistake.With eyes fixed on Savage Moon\u2019s trail, the killer grinned. He knew how to deal with Zhuo Fan. Since his speed was superior to Zhuo Fan, all he needed to do was pay attention to Savage Moon, and killing this kid would be a breeze.However, just as he was about to jump into action, Savage Moon flashed a silver glow. The light wrapped around Zhuo Fan and then streaked by the killer\u2019s body.The killer had no idea what happened and was looking up as his upper half slid to the ground while his lower half stood there unmoving.While he fell, he could still see Zhuo Fan\u2019s grim face. Especially the eyes, cold and unfeeling.Everyone sucked in a cold breath as they watched Zhuo Fan with dread.If one were to say that killing their leader was from a sneak attack, this time around it was a fair fight and yet Zhuo Fan still killed a Bone Tempering expert in an instant.When the silver light flashed again, he was so fast that none of the killers had time to react before Zhuo Fan felled another.Such horrifying speed coupled with the sharp edge of the Savage Moon soaked the backs of the killers in a cold sweat.\u201cAs you dared to come look for trouble in my domain\u2026,\u201d Zhuo Fan squinted at each man around him and trailed a finger across his neck as his eyes turned red, \u201c\u2026Your lives are forfeited.\u201dAt that moment, all of them paled and stepped back. The fear they felt from his eyes mounted the dread they already had. Their roles began to blur as it became unclear who was the victim and who was the killer.The hunter\u2019s and prey\u2019s role were now switched.The fatty watched Zhuo Fan\u2019s domineering gaze while being shell-shocked. Then, he was swept by a sudden familiar feeling, the imposing and grand feeling he felt only from his father.But what he felt from Zhuo Fan was far more assertive. As if all who dared resist this man would find themselves dead beyond a shred of a doubt.The pressure Zhuo Fan\u2019s power released was something that even made him shiver.Seeing that they couldn\u2019t contend with Zhuo Fan individually, a killer shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, let\u2019s attack together. He\u2019s just a Qi Condensation punk relying on a 3rd-grade demonic treasure. If we surround him, he\u2019s done for.\u201dThe others nodded as fear eased from their faces, now that they had a plan, they found hope.With a cry, the killers jumped at Zhuo Fan closing the net on him.Sneering, Zhuo Fan rushed forward without fear as he held Savage Moon. His target swallowed dryly but didn\u2019t retreat since he had men on each side releasing punch at Zhuo Fan.If Zhuo Fan pressed on, the killer would die, but so would Zhuo Fan under the joint attack of two Bone Tempering experts.But if he retreated instead, it would only work to tighten the net and his death would be just a matter of time.Zhuo Fan didn\u2019t plan on dying in this fight, or he would\u2019ve fled a long time ago with the help of Savage Moon\u2019s speed boost.Whoosh!With a flash of silver, Zhuo Fan vanished from their sights and the punches hit nothing but air. Zhuo Fan then landed right in front of the killer who was standing behind the other two.Having not seen this coming, the killer was frightened but soon became elated seeing that Zhuo Fan was not facing him. He didn\u2019t waste this chance and punched towards Zhuo Fan\u2019s defenseless back.[Your head is mine, kid.]But a silver light flashed by and the man froze.In the moment of impending doom, Zhuo Fan swept Savage Moon around him and jumped from their tight circle.As for the man behind Zhuo Fan, he watched wide-eyed as his body hit the ground in two pieces, blood and guts spilling everywhere.Another one!Even under their joint efforts, Zhuo Fan came out unscathed and robbed them of another comrade. Fear in their eyes mounted higher and higher.They had some hope before, wishing to kill him with numbers. But that hope was now lost.\u201cWhat kind of freak is he? When did the Seven Noble Houses have such a person?\u201d A killer cursed as he felt his knees trembling.Secretly sneering, Zhuo Fan squinted his eyes and bathed the world with the killing intent they contained.These killers were routed, they lost their nerve and were no longer a threat. Now was the perfect time to end them.Zhuo Fan rushed forth with a savage grin.Silver light flickered as Zhuo Fan brandished Savage Moon and sent limbs flying with each passing. The killers cried during their futile attempts to evade, having lost any and all will to resist.Zhuo Fan was like a wolf among sheep, taking his fill of slaughter and carnage. For the occasional spirited and still brave souls among them, Blood Infant would enter their body and seal their movements. Thus priming them for Zhuo Fan, only to leave them mangled.If it was any other day, with Zhuo Fan\u2019s strength and Blood Infant\u2019s help, he could only fight with a single Bone Tempering expert. If another joined, he\u2019d have a hard time reacting to their attacks, let alone killing a dozen.But luck had it he got Savage Moon off Elder Yun, whom he killed a month ago.This gave him newfound confidence. Savage Moon was just as deadly as Blood Infant was on Bone Tempering experts, perhaps even more. Especially when taking its ability to increase one\u2019s speed into consideration. And all of this was added to Zhuo Fan who already had the skills to skip stages.Now that he thought about it, he really ought to thank Hell Valley for throwing such a nice toy in his lap.Hearing the Bone Tempering experts\u2019 miserable wails, watching heads and entrails flying about, the fatty remained lifeless from shock. He stood there witnessing the gruesome dance Zhuo Fan was performing with Savage Moon. For these killers to cry and beg for their lives was something unheard of.He could hardly believe that the man he recognized as a love rival, the man he challenged, was strong to this degree.Recalling their duel, it seemed more like a joke now.The Bone Tempering experts were butchered like animals in front of the fatty. [I, a 7th layered Qi Condensation cultivator, dared to issue a challenge, and still was lenient with him while preaching fairness.]\u201cSigh, Yuwen Cong, your lenient act and fairness preaching was meaningless.\u201d The fatty shook his head, feeling mournful.He had seen many peers among the seven houses who were geniuses and even if he wasn\u2019t stronger than them, he believed their strength wasn\u2019t far from his.But Zhuo Fan showed him today what the saying \u2018a man above man, and a sky above a sky\u2019 meant.Those geniuses were nothing but trash by comparison. Furthermore, the gap was so huge at such a young age\u2026Long Kui covered her mouth experiencing the greatest shock she ever felt.This was the first time she saw Zhuo Fan fighting. She had heard of him killing two Profound Heaven experts, but doubt still existed. This notion was far too outrageous for anyone to believe.But watching him fight today, left this young miss stunned.The cruelty, the overbearing eyes, it was as if a demon had descended, one which was capable of scaring and overpowering even Bone Tempering experts.Whoosh!When Zhuo Fan finally stopped, Savage Moon in his hand was dripping blood. The dry earth around him had become a wide pool of blood.A killer shivered as he watched the Savage Moon\u2019s fall with dread. His legs were severed, but the pain wasn\u2019t registered as begging was all that was left on his mind.Not sparing him a glance, Zhuo Fan asked coldly, \u201cWho sent you?\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t reflect an ounce of pity towards any living creature in this world, only coldness.The killer looked around to see his dead brothers and fear swept his heart. He didn\u2019t know where to begin describing the savagery and cruelty of this youth before him. This youth was, in all sense of the word, a demon.The killer\u2019s heart was in shambles.\u201cI-it\u2019s\u2026\u201dBut a sudden whistling sound was heard and the killer\u2019s eyes lost its light.\u201cKilling with intent, a Radiant Stage expert!\u201dZhuo Fan drew a cold breath. His bottomless and cold eyes now showed a ripple of panic\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 - AlliancePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe whistling sound was heard clearly by everyone, but none could afford to slack their guard. On the contrary, each felt their heart in their throat.A Radiant Stage expert was able to kill with divine intent alone. This was an enemy Zhuo Fan wouldn\u2019t be able to defeat even with Blood Infant and Savage Moon.An icy shiver traveled down his spine as Zhuo Fan turned more and more serious.Whoosh!The whistle stopped suddenly and a pair of steps echoed. Zhuo Fan and the other two forgot to breathe. Their eyes were fixed towards the sound\u2019s location.But when the person came out into the open, the fatty was stunned for a second before shouting, \u201cTeacher, how come you\u2019re here?\u201dLong Kui cried with joy, \u201cSenior Fang, what brought you here?\u201dZhuo Fan saw the two recognizing the new entrant and began sizing him up.The man had a goatee and looked like he was in his sixties. He was dressed in a blue robe and had a sword strapped to his back. All this time he was smiling as the green jade flute revolved in his hand.The jade flute shocked Zhuo Fan. He remembered something and asked, \u201cAre you one of the five Divine Dragons, the guardians of the imperial family, Jade Flute Divine Sword, Fang Qiubai?\u201dZhuo Fan heard Long Jiu mention that even if the imperial family could no longer control the seven houses, they could still persevere, all thanks to the five Divine Dragons. Each was a peak Radiant Stage expert whom none of the seven houses would dare mess with.Among them, there was a man known as the First Divine Sword, and he was Fang Qiubai, Jade Flute Divine Sword.He boasted himself as having united the sword and the flute as one, that his sword followed the sound and turned it into sword intent. One time, he singlehandedly defeated five Radiant Stage experts with a sword strike, forcing the seven houses to forget about testing him while also spreading his name to the four corners of the world.The man raised an eyebrow and watched Zhuo Fan with a profound look before nodding.With laughter, Long Jiu appeared before everyone, \u201cWasn\u2019t I right? This kid has sharp eyes. I only mentioned you once and he already recognized you.\u201d\u201cUncle Jiu!\u201dLong Kui was overjoyed as she ran to him, \u201cWhen did you and Senior Fang arrive? Why didn\u2019t you come out sooner?\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, we\u2019ve been here since Brother Zhuo and the 3rd Prince\u2019s duel.\u201dLong Jiu turned to Zhuo Fan, \u201cBrother Zhuo, you\u2019re quite something to keep a straight face against a dozen Bone Tempering experts. When I was your age, I certainly lacked the courage you showed today. I truly admire you!\u201dLong Kui pouted while casting a side glance towards Zhuo Fan.Seeing Zhuo Fan in action had her convinced, but admitting it was a whole nother matter.\u201cMaster, with you two seniors here, why didn\u2019t you act? You almost worried your student to death.\u201d Fatty clapped his fat chest, \u201cIt mattered little what happened to me, but what if Sister Kui got hurt?\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, and miss a good show?\u201dFang Qiubai laughed, eyeing the calm and collected Zhuo Fan, \u201cMoreover, I\u2019ve never seen such a genius\u2019 marvelous display before.\u201d\u201cSenior, you\u2019re too kind!\u201dZhuo Fan cupped his hands, but his face was stone-cold, \u201cI\u2019m only curious, why did senior kill the last one? Is it\u2026\u201dFang Qiubai squinted and his smile turned fake as he spoke in a frosty tone, \u201cYoungster, you are exceptionally sharp, but your strength might turn this advantage into a flaw.\u201dRaising an eyebrow, Zhuo Fan laughed and cupped his hands, \u201cJunior thanks for senior\u2019s lesson. Junior has already forgotten this encounter.\u201dZhuo Fan picked up on Fang Qiubai\u2019s warning. He did not wield enough power to poke his nose in their conflict. The man had silenced the killer to protect him.Fang Qiubai took one more long look at him and his admiration grew, \u201cYou\u2019re not only smart but also know when to retreat; how rare. What a surprise, finding someone like you in the mortal world yet outside the seven houses. If you weren\u2019t a demonic cultivator, something I am unsuited with, I would\u2019ve wanted to teach you for two years and make your future limitless.\u201dLong Kui and fatty were shocked.Outsiders may not know who Fang Qiubai was, but the seven houses were crystal clear on his character. Who among the Heads of the seven houses didn\u2019t want to have their child under his tutelage?But this old man was stubborn as a mule, not giving them any attention.Even if the Emperor were to request him on behalf of his sons, he\u2019d act no differently. He\u2019d been teaching the fatty for three years because Fang Qiubai appreciated his strong will, yet the fatty barely learned a few moves. But it wasn\u2019t enough to accept him as a disciple.Yet the first time he laid eyes on Zhuo Fan, Fang Qiubai took the initiative to invite him. If the two had walked the same cultivation path, Zhuo Fan would\u2019ve been Divine Sword\u2019s first disciple.Wherever he\u2019d go, if any seven houses\u2019 disciples saw him, they\u2019d have to bow down to him.Long Jiu saw the two kids\u2019 shock and surmised their thoughts with a shake of his head. [These kids are yet to reach our level. So they don\u2019t know the meaning of rare find.]With Zhuo Fan\u2019s talent, any expert who saw him would want to take him as a disciple. Even if one was unrivaled in the world, to pass on his mantle he needed to find the best disciple suited for his legacy.The greater the strength of the expert the higher the expectation!But Zhuo Fan shook his head at this and even sneered.Forget about Fang Qiubai not accepting him because of cultivation path difference, even if he could be accepted, he\u2019d still refuse. As a Demonic Emperor, the only one worthy of him calling Master was an Emperor Stage expert.Fang Qiubai was reluctant to let Zhuo Fan pass by him but, in the end, he took fatty and left, \u201cLong Jiu, 3rd Prince still has a task to complete, so I\u2019m taking him with me.\u201dFang Qiubai and fatty disappeared the moment he finished.\u201cWait\u2026\u201d Fatty still wanted to say something to Long Kui and Zhuo Fan, but it was too late. One second his anxious face was there, and the next it was gone.\u201cSo fast!\u201dZhuo Fan was shocked, then he hardened his resolve. He had to reach Radiant Stage as soon as possible to guarantee his safety in his travels across the continent.\u201cBrother Zhuo.\u201dLong Jiu walked to Zhuo Fan with a solemn face, \u201cCome with me to Veiled Dragon Pavilion, there\u2019s something I have for you.\u201dSmiling wryly, Zhuo Fan nodded. He had anticipated this.Fifteen minutes later, Zhuo Fan and Long Jiu were in Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s meeting room and Long Jiu pushed an unwilling Long Kui to guard the door outside. Long Jiu took out a sheepskin branded with four dragon marks.The first words that Zhuo Fan recognized were alliance agreement.Skimming through it, a pleasing smile bloomed on his face.This was what he aimed for from the start, an alliance between Veiled Dragon Pavilion and the Luo clan. Veiled Dragon Pavilion would not only become a support for the Luo clan but would also provide resources without any conditions attached.If the agreement came into effect, he\u2019d be worry-free from any outside attacks and would have the time to develop the Luo clan into a great power.Long Jiu was a bit astounded, \u201cWhy do I feel like you knew this was coming?\u201dZhuo Fan smiled.It had nothing to do with predicting, but planning.Once he settled on having Veiled Dragon Pavilion as an ally, he used the ancient array diagram to entice Long Jiu, then took advantage of Veiled Dragon Pavilion in sticking its neck out for him.But that wasn\u2019t an alliance, it was just the Luo clan seeking shelter. When faced with great danger, Veiled Dragon Pavilion would\u2019ve kicked them out.To avoid the worst outcome, he and Veiled Dragon Pavilion fought side by side and even killed two Profound Heaven elders. He risked offending the Hell Valley to show the potential of the Luo clan.His aim was an alliance agreement of equals.If he were alone, he would\u2019ve avoided showing off by fighting two Profound Heaven experts and amassed fortune instead.If Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s Pavilion Lord was a man of vision, he\u2019d choose alliance. Because he would know that the alliance offered now was like fire in winter for the Luo clan. But if offered in the future, it would be more like decoration, one among many.As such, Zhuo Fan made a daring gambit. Gambling if the Pavilion Lord was a man of ambition who did not bother with trifles, and willing to make an ally out of a fallen clan.Fortunately, he won.Of course, if he lost, then Zhuo Fan would cross Veiled Dragon Pavilion from the list of future potential allies. Just because their leader lacked the bravery and ambition of one.Zhuo Fan smiled as he rolled up the sheepskin, \u201cI will now take it to Young miss for signing.\u201d\u201cWait!\u201d Long Jiu gripped his shoulder, \u201cSign it here and now!\u201dZhuo Fan smiled, \u201cI\u2019m not the Clan Head. Signing it as a Steward will make it void.\u201dWith a sly smirk, Long Jiu looked at Zhuo Fan in the eye, \u201cPavilion Lord said this agreement is not with the Luo clan, but with Zhuo Fan.\u201dFrowning, Zhuo Fan stared hard at Long Jiu.\u201cWherever Zhuo Fan is, that place is Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s ally!\u201d Long Jiu spoke, \u201cThis is Pavilion Lord\u2019s intent!\u201dZhuo Fan frowned, then smiled with a nod.\u201cPavilion Lord sure is ambitious, ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201dIn the dead of night, Zhuo Fan returned to the small courtyard and looked for Captain Pang, \u201cOld Pang, where\u2019s missy, I\u2019m looking for her.\u201dSighing, Old Pang muttered, \u201cI\u2019ll take you to her.\u201dZhuo Fan was taken aback but followed nonetheless.The two entered the kitchen and Zhuo Fan looked at Captain Pang in puzzlement when the latter pointed at Luo Yunchang.Zhuo Fan saw the chaos inside the kitchen and Luo Yunchang, who had fallen asleep next to the stove. Her face even had traces of soot.\u201cSigh, Young miss kept asking the cook for guidance from morning till late into the night.\u201d Captain Pang sighed, blaming Zhuo Fan a little.\u201cSteward Zhuo, I know of your skill, and that Young miss and Young master do not enter your eyes. But you must know, Young miss worked hard day in day out for a whole month to cook for you so that you could have them when you come out of seclusion. But her efforts were not appreciated instead she received your harsh criticization. Any girl would\u2019ve been devastated after such a response\u2026\u201dIgnoring Captain Pang\u2019s rant, Zhuo Fan walked next to the stove where the few dishes Luo Yunchang made laid. Compared to those at noon, these dishes were almost burned.Zhuo Fan took a bite and shook his head, \u201cShe has no talent whatsoever.\u201d\u201cSigh, even so, at least show some consideration for her work.\u201d Captain Pang rebuked as he walked next to the dishes and tried one, \u201cHow hard can it be to swallow?\u201dHe also took a bite and chewed it just once before spitting it right back out.\u201cYou\u2019re right, Steward Zhuo, Young miss is inept at cooking. Sorry for blaming you.\u201d Captain Pang wiped his mouth and walked out with a red face.But when he turned back, he saw Zhuo Fan taking one bite after another, and even savoring it.\u201cUh, Steward Zhuo, don\u2019t force yourself. Ignore what I said. Now that I\u2019ve also tried Young miss\u2019 cooking, it\u2019s indeed\u2026\u201d Captain Pang\u2019s mouth clamped shut and his face twisted.\u201cI\u2019m just a bit hungry.\u201dZhuo Fan smiled as he ate everything\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47 - Imperial Family\u2019s InvitationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the morning, a ray of sunshine entered the small courtyard\u2019s kitchen.Luo Yunchang\u2019s eyelids trembled as she opened her drowsy eyes. She looked around the kitchen and smiled dejectedly.Last night, she was so tired after cooking that she fell asleep in the kitchen itself.Even if anyone caught wind of this, no one would believe it. A Qi Condensation cultivator tiring herself out from cooking? But the truth was she was too fatigued that she would rather pick cultivation instead of cooking.Just as she was getting up, she froze. Someone had put a plain cover on her and her back wasn\u2019t leaning on the hard stove but on something soft instead.Pursing her lips, she turned her head only to see a sleeping Zhuo Fan leaning on her. And what kept her back soft was his arm.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dLuo Yunchang was about to yelp but she covered her mouth. It never crossed her mind that Zhuo Fan would spend the night with her here.Blushing, Luo Yunchang observed his face and wanted to take advantage of this opportunity. Young miss\u2019 red lips were inching ever closer to his face.\u201cSteward Zhuo, Young miss\u2026\u201dA sudden rough shout came from Captain Pang. Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyelids trembled and were about to open.Luo Yunchang immediately laid her head back on his shoulder and faked sleeping without budging. Just that her red face betrayed her as if she\u2019d done something she shouldn\u2019t.Zhuo Fan opened his eyes, took a deep breath, and frowned when he saw Captain Pang coming in, \u201cOld Pang, what\u2019s the rush?\u201d\u201cUh, Brother Zhuo, Young miss\u2026\u201d Captain Pang pointed at Luo Yunchang with shock.Zhuo Fan turned to see Luo Yunchang\u2019s red and shivering face. He touched her forehead, \u201cIt\u2019s burning up. Did she catch a cold?\u201dShaking his head, Zhuo Fan blamed himself.Last night, he wanted to take Luo Yunchang back to her room, but afraid of waking her up, he chose to watch over her in the kitchen. He didn\u2019t think sleep would cast its spell on him too.\u201cOld Pang, say what you came to say. Meanwhile, I\u2019ll take this missy back to her room.\u201dZhuo Fan carried Luo Yunchang, but Old Pang was panicking, \u201cYou can\u2019t, brother Zhuo. Someone wants to invite Young miss for a chat. Someone we can\u2019t offend.\u201d\u201cWhat can\u2019t offend? She won\u2019t be going even if the Veiled Dragon Pavilion asked.\u201d Zhuo Fan snapped, \u201cCan\u2019t you see she has lost consciousness? She must be sick. Wait for a bit and I\u2019ll go see the guest.\u201d\u201cSigh, brother Zhuo, Steward Zhuo, Young miss must go meet him in person. He bears the Imperial Golden Seal.\u201d Captain Pang shouted.Zhuo Fan stopped.Only the Imperial family\u2019s guards had this seal. Even the seven houses\u2019 leaders would have to respond at once or they\u2019d have committed a grave crime. The lightest punishment was death, while the harshest was dragging one\u2019s whole clan with him.Of course, with the Seven Noble Houses\u2019 power, the Imperial family would refrain from resorting to such methods. But that didn\u2019t apply to a fallen clan like them.Zhuo Fan squinted and thought it through, \u201cOld Pang, tell him Young miss is unwell and that he should come back tomorrow.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dCaptain Pang\u2019s heart jumped in fright.[That person carries the Emperor\u2019s edict. If you do this, it is the same as saying you don\u2019t want to talk to him.]But Zhuo Fan had it thought out. Thinking back to last night, he guessed the one calling him over was that fatty\u2019s guard.The fatty was a good man and wouldn\u2019t let emotions cloud his judgment, slaughtering innocents left and right.\u201cDo what I said, now!\u201d Zhuo Fan raised his voice.\u201cWait!\u201dLuo Yunchang yelled, struggling out of Zhuo Fan\u2019s embrace and spoke with a stern face, \u201cCaptain Pang, tell him to wait a moment to make myself presentable.\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201dCaptain Pang bowed and secretly rejoiced. [Thank god, Young miss woke up or who knew how much trouble brother Zhuo\u2019s arrangement would\u2019ve stirred up.][But this Steward Zhuo sure is dauntless. If I were to follow his words, I\u2019ll die of fright.]Captain Pang shook his head and left.Zhuo Fan watched Luo Yunchang skeptically. [How did she regain consciousness all of a sudden?]Luo Yunchang rolled her eyes, \u201cWhy are you so reckless? Is the Imperial family someone you can offend?\u201dTo avoid him noticing anything, Luo Yunchang rushed away. Zhuo Fan was left to walk alone to the living room, with doubt in his heart.He met with the man carrying the seal, a peak Qi Condensation cultivator. He was one of the porters to fatty\u2019s palanquin.\u201cAre you Steward Zhuo? My master is inviting you and Young miss Luo for a talk.\u201dThe envoy cupped his hands, but the prideful attitude never left him. And either on purpose or otherwise, the Imperial Golden Seal flashed on his waist. Perhaps he was afraid they\u2019d mistake him for someone other than the Imperial family\u2019s guard.Zhuo Fan snorted, [You\u2019re still soft thinking you can fake your arrogance around me. When I was faking it, you were still but an egg in your mother\u2019s belly.]Zhuo Fan didn\u2019t even look at him as he slumped in a chair, one leg over the other.The envoy\u2019s eyes swelled with rage.\u201cIs the fatty\u2019s injury healed?\u201d Zhuo Fan asked in passing.[Fatty?] The man was stunned.Then it hit him that Zhuo Fan was calling his master fatty. But the number of people in this world who dared to call him that was less than ten.[Then he and master are\u2026]His heart started beating a mile a minute and the arrogance was gone from his eyes, \u201cMy master did not mention any injury when he returned last night.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dZhuo Fan raised an eyebrow, then laughed, \u201cHe must be thinking of his image. I punched him thirty-odd times yesterday and kicked him a dozen times more. There\u2019s no way he\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think so too? That fatty must be faking it so you guys won\u2019t laugh at him, ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201d Zhuo Fan quirked his eyebrows at the man.The envoy\u2019s lips twitched, unable to respond. But he was embarrassed nonetheless.\u201cRight, was that old goat Fang Qiubai still angry after he arrived?\u201d Zhuo Fan looked at him carefully this time.But the envoy just shook his head.Fang Qiubai returned with his master yesterday and only then did they find out about Fang Qiubai\u2019s arrival. Since Zhuo Fan knew this before them, it spoke how close he was with his master.At this point, the envoy stashed the seal in his pants. It worked well in scaring some, but it was best to not make a fool of himself in front of such a Young master like Zhuo Fan.\u201cGreat!\u201dSeeing the envoy shaking his head, Zhuo Fan rejoiced, \u201cPerhaps you don\u2019t know but that old goat wanted to take me as a disciple. If not for my staunch heart and me choosing death over kneeling, the old goat would\u2019ve taken me away by now. I still thought he was angry and was going to come nag me again. Now that I know he isn\u2019t, I can rest easy. That old goat understands my predicament.\u201d\u201cWhat, Fang Qiubai wanted to take you as a disciple?\u201dThe man shouted as his legs went soft and collapsed.[Heavens! Who the hell is this Young master? He is a friend that beat up master and also someone wanted as a disciple by Jade Flute Divine Sword Fang Qiubai, who the Emperor shows respect to?]Zhuo Fan secretly sneered, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why fall over?\u201d\u201cLet me help you!\u201d Zhuo Fan said so but showed no intention of moving.The envoy was sharp enough to get back on his feet while waving his hand, \u201cNo need, Steward Zhuo, I don\u2019t dare ask you of such a favor. I am not worthy.\u201d\u201cHumph, a servant\u2019s instinct!\u201d Zhuo Fan disdained, \u201cYou call helping you get up, a favor?\u201d\u201cMight you be the Emperor\u2019s envoy?\u201dLuo Yunchang, dressed to impress, walked before him and bowed. The envoy rushed to kowtow, \u201cYou are making it hard on me. Please don\u2019t be so courteous. If master heard I was disrespectful to his friends, he will punish me.\u201dLuo Yunchang was at a loss and turned to Zhuo Fan, who just shrugged.But Captain Pang, who was behind her, was stunned silly at the sight of the envoy\u2019s courteous attitude.[Where\u2019s your previous haughty attitude? Spouting something like if Young miss didn\u2019t come to see you in fifteen minutes, you\u2019d be executing all of us. Why the sudden change of tones?]But even this change was too outrageous and polite.Captain Pang eyed Zhuo Fan who only sported a puzzling smile.Old Pang figured Steward Zhuo had something to do with it and gave him a thumbs up.[Only Steward Zhuo can make an Imperial family\u2019s guard kowtow to our Young miss.]Zhuo Fan dismissed the envoy\u2019s courtesy, \u201cWhy is that fatty calling me?\u201d\u201cI-I do not know. I was only ordered to invite Windgaze City\u2019s Cai clan, Lei clan and Luo clan.\u201d The envoy spoke with extreme politeness.Zhuo Fan squinted.[It seems that the Hell Valley targeting the three clans must have something to do with the Imperial family\u2026]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The four guards posted at the door were Bone Tempering experts.Zhuo Fan and Luo Yunchang came along with Luo Yunhai and Captain Pang with the envoy as their guide.\u201cSteward Zhuo, Young miss Luo, please enter!\u201dThe man was very polite. He opened the door, stood to the side and bowed for them to pass. The other guards frowned with doubt and a flicker of scorn in their eyes.They were Imperial family\u2019s guards, always welcomed with bows and courtesy everywhere.But this guy went to invite some no-name Clan Heads and even bowed down before them. He was seen as a disgrace by his fellow guards.The man picked up on scorn, but he just smirked.[How can idiots know the importance these people hold?][Steward Zhuo is master\u2019s friend, who even Senior Fang Qiubai has his eyes on. He needs to say just one word and he\u2019d be Fang Qiubai\u2019s disciple. Even the Emperor will have to show respect then.][As for the other three, they\u2019re Steward Zhuo\u2019s friends. We can\u2019t show any disrespect even to them.]Secretly snorting, the envoy still showed a flattering smile as he guided them inside.They soon arrived at a garden.A single pavilion laid in the middle with a stone table inside. Fatty sat in the seat of honor and behind him stood Jade Flute Divine Sword, Fang Qiubai.On one side of the fatty was Lei Yuntian, with Lei Yuting and Xiao Cui behind him. On the other, it was Cai Rong and his son, Cai Xiaoting.There were two additional empty stools around the table, for Zhuo Fan and Luo Yunchang.\u201cThis must be a meeting of the three Clan Heads.\u201d Zhuo Fan rubbed his nose and took a step back, letting Luo Yunhai take the lead.\u201cBro Zhuo\u2026\u201dLuo Yunhai didn\u2019t understand, while Zhuo Fan smiled, \u201cShow them the dignity of a Clan Head, and don\u2019t let them look down on you.\u201dLuo Yunhai understood as Luo Yunchang showed a grateful look.It was clear this meeting was between the three Clan Heads and the Imperial family. But after the events over the past few months, all of Windgaze City knew that Luo clan\u2019s true Clan Head was Zhuo Fan.Even the Imperial family might be considering Zhuo Fan as the master of the Luo clan.Zhuo Fan did this now so that he did not exceed his authority, and was letting Luo clan come into the light. He wanted to state the fact Luo clan\u2019s Clan Head was still named Luo.\u201cPlease, come in.\u201dThe envoy saw the 3rd prince and bowed ninety degrees towards Zhuo Fan in a show of respect he had for his master\u2019s friend.But this had a different effect on everyone. The fatty was stunned, [Since when were the Imperial family\u2019s guards so humble?]Cai clan and Lei clan were of the same opinion.When this guard came to invite them, he was brazen, cocky and flaunting, not carrying in the least who he was talking to. But towards the Luo clan, he treated them like guests.The two clans felt apprehensive in their hearts, they were even more envious. They were all clans of Windgaze City yet the treatment was worlds apart.Only Fang Qiubai smiled, guessing Zhuo Fan might have twisted facts to scare the envoy. But this only worked to admire him more.Under the envoy\u2019s polite call, the Luo clan stepped into the pavilion. Luo Yunchang greeted the fatty, \u201cI am Luo Yunchang, greetings, Your Highness!\u201dOn the way here, the envoy told them of his master. The others followed Luo Yunchang in showing respect. But Zhuo Fan just shrugged.The fatty only waved, not taking Zhuo Fan\u2019s disrespect seriously, \u201cPlease sit.\u201dLuo Yunchang and her brother took a seat, while Zhuo Fan and Captain Pang stood behind them.Fatty threw a long look towards Zhuo Fan, secretly nodding. [Great authority, but without any arrogance. He is a loyal subject!]Fang Qiubai smiled with praise in his eyes.Zhuo Fan\u2019s conduct was etched in the two\u2019s hearts. Wielding his martial prowess to protect his master, and courteous enough to defend his master\u2019s honor. In the eyes of the Imperial family, he was a rare and valuable official.The fatty began, \u201cI have invited the three Clan Heads today per the Imperial edict to reveal to you the thousand-years-old relationship between the three clans.\u201dEveryone was focused on fatty\u2019s next words.\u201cThe three Clan Heads must have each received an instruction from the previous Clan Head, to not make an enemy out of each other. And perhaps even mentioned about helping one another.\u201dFatty stood up, \u201cMoreover, the three clan\u2019s power must never leave Windgaze City until the pearls shine.\u201dCai Rong and Lei Yuntian watched the fatty in puzzlement. Luo Yunchang got a nod from her brother and also looked puzzled.\u201cHa-ha-ha, in fact, this is an agreement between the founding Imperial family a thousand years ago and the three Clan Heads of that time, known as Secret Pearl Order.\u201d Fatty smiled and his eyes flashed, \u201cCai clan, Luo clan, Lei clan and the Seven Noble Houses are the same, they are all loyal officials, founders of the empire.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dLike a bomb was thrown on them, the three clan\u2019s representatives were shell shocked. They never thought that their origins were the same as the seven houses. But why had they fallen so low that they could only stay in Windgaze City as mortal clans?The fatty turned a bit bashful, guessing their thoughts, \u201cSorry, this is what our Yumen clan owes you.\u201dSighing, fatty continued, \u201cAt that time, Tianyu Empire was just established and was shaky, with unrest among its people. The Great Ancestor and founder sent his seven ministers across the kingdom to employ autonomous administration and settle the land. This gave them enough power to make them equal to the Imperial family. They later became the Seven Noble Houses.\u201d\u201cIn just twenty years, the seven houses grew exponentially, and their greed ignited a war among them. The Imperial family could no longer keep them in check and had to employ schemes in weakening them. The seven houses were ultimately aware that there will be no winners in their war and ceased fire. But the aftermath was cruel. The people were suffering, the empire was mourning, and it was just one step away from collapsing.\u201d\u201cBut how is this connected to us?\u201d Zhuo Fan frowned.Taking a deep breath, fatty straightened his back, \u201cEveryone, to be honest, your clans are founders of our empire. If your elders were still sitting in the Imperial court, they would be no less famous than the Four Pillars!\u201dEveryone sucked in a cold breath.Four Pillars were the support of the Tianyu Empire, leading the military, economy, politics, external affairs\u2026 They were the only ones capable of resisting the seven houses.There was a rumor, the Four Pillars\u2019 power was so strong it struck fear in the Imperial family.Imperial family, Four Pillars and the Seven Noble Houses represented the empire\u2019s highest power, but also restricting each other in a delicate balance. If one side tips, the balance would crumble and the empire would fall.No one could believe that their ancestors were so amazing and capable of becoming the empire\u2019s Four Pillars of today.The fatty lost his smile at this point, \u201cThe Great Ancestor at the time set up the Secret Pearl Order with your ancestors to prevent another war from breaking out among the seven houses. The Emperor used all kinds of excuses to demote your ancestors to Windgaze City and become common clans. But the Imperial family could, at any time, combine the three clans into a great clan equal to the rank of the seven houses. This would occur only when war broke out again between the seven houses. Then this new clan would add balance to the equation, to save as many lives as possible.\u201d\u201cBut, even if an eighth house were to appear, it cannot stop the seven houses.\u201d Luo Yunchang voiced her doubts.Zhuo Fan cut fatty off with a smile before he could speak, \u201cYoung miss, the eighth house\u2019s purpose isn\u2019t to stop them but to add balance. A war breaks out only when one side has absolute confidence in winning it. But a war in which winning was possible at a heavy cost won\u2019t happen unless the two sides hated each other to the bone. Sometimes, when two power starts a conflict, it is very easily solved, since no one wants to suffer irreparable damages.\u201dLuo Yunchang nodded, and the fatty praised Zhuo Fan, \u201cSteward Zhuo is amazing. Luo clan will rise for sure in your capable hands.\u201dCai Rong\u2019s lips twitched from the regret he felt.If he hadn\u2019t offended Zhuo Fan, he might\u2019ve been able to rope him. This kid was a genius seen once in a thousand years.\u201c3rd Prince, we know of the relationship between the three clans. What I want to know is, how are you going to secure our rise to the eighth seat.\u201d Zhuo Fan stared at the fatty.Raising his brow, the fatty nodded in admiration, \u201cThat\u2019s Steward Zhuo for you, hitting the nail on the head.\u201d\u201cOf course, the Imperial family\u2019s power is enough to make a clan rise in a short time. The hard part though is how to keep it hidden!\u201d Zhuo Fan smiled, \u201cYou think the seven houses would just watch us rise up to their level?\u201dCai Rong and Lei Yuntian\u2019s backs went cold with sweat.They were elated that their ancestors had been Imperial court officials. They were thinking, [My clan will receive the Imperial family\u2019s support to rise above a common clan.]But Zhuo Fan brought them down to earth.Not to mention growing stronger, the seven houses wouldn\u2019t even let the new clan grow to their level. They would be destroyed while they were at their weakest.Cai Rong and Lei Yuntian were grateful for Zhuo Fan\u2019s reminder.The Imperial family wanted the seven houses\u2019 power in balance, but the three of them wanted to survive.Cai Rong had to admire Zhuo Fan\u2019s prudent mind\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 - Three Clans as OnePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter muttering under his breath for a while, the fatty spoke, \u201cThis was settled at the moment the secret order was given. What is a clan\u2019s foundation? Spirit stones, pills? No, these are support items. Strength is the best guarantee of a powerful clan.\u201d\u201cVeiled Dragon Pavilion has its nine outstanding elders, Hell Valley has its twelve elders as overseers. Each of the seven houses has its own strength. Also, every one of them has invited a Venerable. Along with other secret weapons they\u2019re holding, even we, the Imperial family, don\u2019t dare stir them.\u201dFatty\u2019s eyes then shined like a radiant sun, \u201cAt the time, in order to paralyze the seven houses, Great Ancestor confiscated the wealth of your clans. This is why none of you has any decent cultivation method and martial arts. It was also because of this reason the seven houses withdrew their surveillance on you five hundred years ago.\u201d\u201cYet none of them would have thought that you all are still holding a low profound ranked martial art.\u201d Fatty showed a sneaky smile, \u201cWith this martial art all of you can become strong. Even the seven houses only have one or two profound ranked martial arts.\u201dThe three clans were amazed.When did they have such a martial art? If they had it, they\u2019d have used it to grow strong by now.Only Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes rolled about, recalling something.With a vague smile, fatty\u2019s hand flashed and revealed a green jade slip, \u201cThis is a low mortal ranked martial art, Combining Art. By itself, it holds no value, but if you use it along with your clans\u2019 spirit ranked martial arts you inherited, you can combine them into a single martial art of the profound rank.\u201d\u201cIn other words, Luo clan\u2019s Returning Dragon Palm, Cai clan\u2019s Wind Kick, and Lei clan\u2019s Lightning Finger were originally one single martial art that the Imperial family split among the three clans. And only the Imperial family knew the way to restore it.\u201d Zhuo Fan squinted.Fatty was shocked but then nodded, \u201cSteward Zhuo is wise. There aren\u2019t many martial arts which are capable of splitting other martial arts, and the number of martial arts that can restore them are even lesser. I didn\u2019t think Steward Zhuo would know of this. If imperial father hadn\u2019t mentioned it, I would\u2019ve never found out.\u201dZhuo Fan just smiled.Perhaps because the splitting martial arts were uncommon even at the mortal rank, each sect in the Sacred Domain seized them. They split their core martial arts to prevent degenerate disciples from spreading it. Only the sect leader\u2019s disciple had the right to learn the entire set of martial arts.Zhuo Fan turned to look at Cai clan and Lei clan. They were startled, but their eyes showed deep regret.Perhaps because they were negligent in safeguarding their inherited martial arts and let the Hell Valley steal them. Especially with regards to Cai clan, who were quick to give it away.[It must be really eating Cai Rong inside right now!]\u201cClan Heads, please take out your inherited martial arts.\u201d Fatty placed the jade slip on the table with a smile.But only Luo Yunchang took out her clan\u2019s martial art. After Lei Yuting got to know of Yang Ming\u2019s treachery, she gave back the Returning Dragon Palm to Luo Yunchang. But the other clan heads looked at each other in shame.Fatty frowned as he stared at them.Sighing, Lei Yuntian cupped his hands, \u201cYour Highness, I was unable to protect my ancestor\u2019s martial art from Hell Valley\u2019s thieving hands. I accept Your Highness\u2019 punishment.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Fatty slapped the table.Cai Rong also cupped his hands, \u201cYour Highness\u2026 I am the same\u2026\u201dFatty\u2019s body shivered in rage, \u201cY-you, just how are you both Clan Heads? Have you forgotten your ancestor\u2019s instructions? You should have defended it with your lives.\u201dThe two kneeled, \u201cPlease forgive us, Your Highness.\u201dFatty sighed as he scratched his head.Cai Rong peeked at him, \u201cYour Highness, can\u2019t the Imperial family bestow us another profound ranked martial art?\u201d\u201cBestow your mom!\u201dFatty couldn\u2019t hold it in and began raining curses and spitting all over Cai Rong\u2019s kneeling figure, \u201cWhat do you take profound ranked martial arts for, cabbage? Even the Imperial family has only four of them. And they\u2019re each registered. If I take one out, everyone will know. How are your clans gonna rise then?\u201d\u201cYou dumb pig, are you tired of living?\u201d Fatty gave Cai Rong a round of slapping then stomped his feet.Cai Rong curled up and shivered on the ground.\u201cWhat now, what now? The Secret Pearl Order is ruined!\u201d Fatty paced around.Zhuo Fan smirked and two jade slips appeared with a flash in his hand, \u201c3rd Prince, there\u2019s no need to worry. I have their clans\u2019 martial arts.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe two Clan Heads shouted in unison, staring dumbfounded in Zhuo Fan\u2019s direction. Cai Rong in particular, having not witnessed Zhuo Fan\u2019s prowess, was incredulous at what was happening.Lei Yuntian gave Zhuo Fan a thankful nod. If not for him, not only Lei clan wouldn\u2019t recover, they\u2019d even be executed in a fit of anger by 3rd Prince.\u201cHa-ha-ha, Steward Zhuo, you truly are amazing. I see why Elder Jiu of Veiled Dragon Pavilion speaks so highly of you!\u201d Fatty was overjoyed, and ran into Zhuo Fan for a bear hug, \u201cIf not for you, I would\u2019ve failed Imperial Father\u2019s task. I owe you one.\u201dSmiling, Zhuo Fan shook his head, \u201cThis is all for the Luo clan!\u201d\u201cYes, right, for the Luo clan and for me, ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201d Fatty slapped Zhuo Fan\u2019s shoulder, then gathered the four jade slips, \u201cNow that we have the martial arts, next is the merger of the three clans. According to the Great Ancestor\u2019s Secret Pearl Order, two clans are to merge with the strongest. And the profound ranked martial art will be in the Clan Head\u2019s care. As such, you\u2026\u201d\u201cYour Highness,\u201d Cai Rong seemed hyped as he jumped to his feet, \u201cLuo clan has little strength and only four members, and Lei clan is on the verge of collapse, only my Cai clan is flourishing. As such, I will begrudgingly accept this responsibility and support them under my clan\u2019s wing. As of now, I will take Lei and Luo clan as Cai clan\u2019s disciples and assist the Imperial family in fulfilling the secret edict.\u201dAs he finished speaking, Cai Rong reached for the jade slips but a rough hand stopped him. Lei Yuntian glared at him as he asked.\u201cCai Rong, how can a Bone Tempering cultivator be enough to act as Clan Head?\u201d\u201cHumph, so what? Based on strength, my clan is the best.\u201d Cai Rong raised his brows.\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure.\u201d Lei Yuntian sneered at Cai Rong and looked at Lei Yunting. She showed a proud smile and stepped forward, \u201cClan Head Cai, in this last month, I gathered all the scattered Blackwind Mountain\u2019s men. We have six hundred men, half of them are in Qi Condensation. Based on strength alone, the Cai clan is weaker.\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, so what if you\u2019re strong? You\u2019re just bandits!\u201dCai Xiaoting laughed at her, \u201cLei clan is but a rabble of thugs! If you take the role of Clan Head, we\u2019ll only be the seven houses\u2019 laughingstock, never will we be able to reach their level.\u201d\u201cWho are you calling a thug? You want a piece of me?\u201d\u201cYou say you\u2019re not, thug granny?\u201dIn an instant, the Lei and Cai clans started fighting for the leader\u2019s position. Zhuo Fan was secretly sneering at the side.[This new clan is just being established, and it was still a question if it could survive. Yet these bunch of idiots are plagued with delusions of grandeur that they could hold their own against the seven houses.]Fatty and Fang Qiubai mocked the quarrelling clans with their eyes.Luo Yunchang\u2019s face burned in anger. They were fighting against each other while ignoring the Luo clan. It clearly showed that they thought little of her clan.Although they were but four members, they were still one of the three clans in the edict. But these clans didn\u2019t even ask for their opinion!Bam!With that loud slap, the two clans stopped and turned to see the brat Luo Yunhai hitting the table.His face was stern and his eyes were steadfast, unlike his usual childish self. Even Zhuo Fan quirked an eyebrow.\u201cWhy all this fuss?\u201dLuo Yunhai swept the people with his eyes and spoke with resolve, \u201cIn this merger of clans, the only one worthy of the leader position is none other than my Luo clan.\u201dLuo Yunhai\u2019s declaration shocked them silly. Cai Xiaoting mocked, \u201cWhat does a brat know? You\u2019re the weakest of us, nothing of worth at all. What gives you the right to lead us?\u201dSneering, Luo Yunhai grinned.Everyone there recognized his look, the spitting image of someone they all knew very well. This made them turn their eyes to Zhuo Fan.[Hell, Zhuo Fan ruined him!]Zhuo Fan was quite piqued by this brat.\u201cLuo clan has no men, money or pills. It only has us four, masters and servants.\u201d Luo Yunhai looked at them with sparkling eyes, \u201cBut our clan is the strongest because we have Steward Zhuo!\u201dLuo Yunhai turned to Zhuo Fan with worship in his gaze.If Luo clan was to have any right to become the head, it would all be thanks to Zhuo Fan. His skills were obvious to anyone there. Even Veiled Dragon Pavilion was certain that if Zhuo Fan stayed with Luo clan, its rise was but a matter of time.Under the hopeful and worried gazes, especially Luo Yunhai\u2019s expectant look, Zhuo Fan shook his head.[This kid hardly ever shows such great expectations from me. I can\u2019t disappoint him now, can I?]\u201cHumph, Zhuo Fan is a mere steward. How can a person of low status like him be worthy to hold on to all our Cai clan\u2019s guards and wealth? Punk, our clan shall be the head, don\u2019t\u2026 \u201cCai Xiaoting mocked but didn\u2019t finish as Zhuo Fan slapped the table, revealing the alliance agreement.Under the puzzlement of others, Zhuo Fan sneered, \u201cThis is Luo clan and Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s alliance contract.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe fatty was so shocked his whole body trembled and was close to falling off his chair. Even the relaxed and uncaring Fang Qiubai behind him narrowed his eyes as he scanned the sheepskin with shock.Veiled Dragon Pavilion was one of the Seven Noble Houses. The only ones worthy of signing an alliance agreement with them were others from the seven houses, while the rest only had the right to sign a subsidiary agreement. But now\u2026With a deep look, Fang Qiubai sighed as he asked Zhuo Fan, \u201cKid, how did you do it?\u201d\u201cRecognized and valued as a hero!\u201dHe nodded towards Fang Qiubai then turned to the two clans and spoke in a cold tone, \u201cLet me tell you, even if this crappy Secret Pearl Order never existed, as long as I\u2019m here, Luo clan will ultimately rise to the ranks of the seven houses.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re of no help to us! On the contrary, you are a burden.\u201d Zhuo Fan sneered.The two other clans lost their voices in shock.With rosy cheeks, Luo Yunchang raised her chin proudly. Luo Yunhai was grinning from excitement, watching Zhuo Fan with veneration\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 - MergerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMulling over, the fatty traced his hand on the alliance agreement.He found Zhuo Fan\u2019s strength exceeding his expectations as it was not a simple matter to gain such an alliance agreement. Even if Long Jiu was in favor of him, an elder didn\u2019t hold much sway in the Veiled Dragon Pavilion.Fatty sighed, \u201cSteward Zhuo, I am saddened by seeing you live in such a poor clan. Why don\u2019t\u2026 you come help me. Just think about it.\u201dTo the shock of everyone present, the 3rd Prince expressed his intention in recruiting Zhou Fan. It amazed them that Zhuo Fan was so highly sought after that even the Imperial family was willing to have him.Luo Yunchang stood up nervously, thinking Zhuo Fan would be snatched away.Zhuo Fan smiled and shook his head, \u201c3rd Prince, you\u2019re overestimating me. Even in the Luo clan, am I not doing my best for the Imperial family?\u201dFatty quirked an eyebrow and smiled, \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201dHe then turned to the rest, \u201cIt\u2019s decided. The Luo clan will be the leader of the three clans merger. Cai and Lei clans are to assist the Luo clan in fulfilling the Secret Pearl Order.\u201d\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201dCai Xiaoting was disgruntled and wanted to voice his objection, but Cai Rong gripped his arm. He didn\u2019t understand the reason but fatty\u2019s pin-sized eyes left him shivering from the killing intent.Secret Pearl Order was a millennium-old secret plan, and it held great importance to the Imperial family. It was understandable that they would only choose the best clan for the position of leader.If the three clans were equal, the Imperial family would\u2019ve taken his objection into consideration.But Zhuo Fan took out the alliance agreement, making all dissent moot. It turned the Luo clan into the best choice in implementing the secret edict for the Imperial family. If even with this, the other clans voiced their discontent, the Imperial family would deal them with a heavy hand.Just as Zhuo Fan said, the Luo clan had all the power it needed to bring the secret edict to fruition. This, in turn, made the other two clans their vassals. If they felt that being a vassal was unpleasant, the Imperial family would finish them off with a mere swipe.Cai Xiaoting let the matter drop, yet the discontent never left his face. He could only follow Cai Rong\u2019s actions in submitting.Fatty nodded, then turned to Lei Yuntian to see if he had objections. The old man said, \u201cYour Highness, be at ease. I will give my all in assisting Yunhai and Yunchang. As Cloud Manor fell because of me, I will become a servant to atone for my crimes.\u201dFatty nodded at his sincerity, \u201cGood, since there are no objections, the three clans shall unite.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Everyone bowed, \u201cWe shall now withdraw!\u201d\u201cSteward Zhuo stay for a while.\u201dZhuo Fan was unclear as to the reason why but remained nonetheless under the departing and curious gazes of the rest.The fatty let out a breath then rushed to Zhuo Fan and dragged him to an empty place in the garden.\u201c3rd Prince\u2026\u201d Zhuo Fan frowned.Fatty waved, \u201cJust follow my lead.\u201dFatty then pointed two fingers at the sky as he shouted, \u201cI, Tianyu Empire\u2019s 3rd Prince, Yuwen Cong, vow to heaven to become sworn brother with Luo clan\u2019s steward, Zhuo Fan. To share life and death together and never betray him!\u201d\u201cYour turn!\u201d Fatty watched Zhuo Fan impatiently.Zhuo Fan was confused, but becoming sworn brothers with 3rd Prince had to be a good thing so he went along, \u201cI, Luo clan\u2019s steward, Zhuo Fan, vow to Heaven to become sworn brother with Tianyu Empire\u2019s 3rd Prince, Yuwen Cong. If he doesn\u2019t betray me, I won\u2019t either!\u201dFatty muttered when he heard the last part, \u201cBrother, you sure are meticulous.\u201d\u201cFatty, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust you, but the pugilistic world is too vicious.\u201d Zhuo Fan shrugged, not having any restraint in calling him fatty. Since no one was here, the fatty himself wouldn\u2019t blow a gasket over this.[Plus, this kid needs me to complete the secret edict.]Zhuo Fan was perfectly clear when to be fierce and when to be scared.Just as he foresaw, the fatty nodded instead of getting angry, \u201cCall me how you like it. I feel much better since we are sworn brothers now.\u201dZhuo Fan looked at him in puzzlement.Fatty sighed, \u201cDo you remember our bet from yesterday? The winner gets to have Sister Kui. I lost the bet but I still can\u2019t let it go. So I decided to become sworn brothers with you. This way I won\u2019t go after my brother\u2019s wife and it would help me forget about Sister Kui too.\u201dZhuo Fan rose an eyebrow, incredulous that the fatty wanted to become sworn brothers over this, \u201cFatty, there\u2019s nothing between me and that girl. She was just making excuses.\u201d\u201cWhat, is that true?\u201d Fatty even jumped ten meters in joy, \u201cThen can I still chase her?\u201dNodding, Zhuo Fan showed a vague smile, \u201cGo, go, annoy the little lass to death!\u201d\u201cAwesome, brother. You are indeed my sworn brother, ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201d Fatty was skipping and whooping in joy. Now that the bet was off, he could chase Long Kui to his heart\u2019s content.Zhuo Fan smiled, \u201cFatty, what does the Secret Pearl Order truly say?\u201dThe fatty dropped his smile, watching Zhuo Fan with embarrassment, \u201cBrother, didn\u2019t I say it already?\u201d\u201cThis plan is very delicate, and even the goal is fair, but,\u201d Zhuo Fan squinted, \u201cIt lacks ambition. So much so that an Emperor of a founding empire would never come up with it.\u201dThe Great Ancestor showed great ambition when he established the empire. Zhuo Fan wasn\u2019t gullible enough to believe the secret millennium order was limited to restricting the seven houses and maintaining a balance of power.Fatty shook his head, \u201cI do not know either. This was what I\u2019ve been told.\u201dZhuo Fan stared him down but discovered nothing else. Maybe he knew nothing, or maybe his acting was top notch.\u201cThen how did Hell Valley catch wind of this thousand-year-old secret edict?\u201d Zhuo Fan smiled, \u201cAll of Hell Valley\u2019s actions were against the secret edict while looking innocent doing it. They were afraid of the Imperial family\u2019s investigation.\u201dFatty frowned, \u201cReason points to the contrary, but there are many spies in the Imperial Capital, the information about secret edict might have leaked.\u201d\u201cIt remained hidden for a thousand years and only now it gets leaked?\u201d Zhuo Fan frowned, \u201cMaybe leaking it is part of the secret edict\u2019s contents?\u201dThe fatty shivered and went wide-eyed.Zhuo Fan smirked, [It\u2019s clear now.]\u201cNever mind, it works in Luo clan\u2019s benefit anyway. So there\u2019s no need to poke my nose in it. There\u2019s no need to worry over nothing, ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201dZhuo Fan waved as he left, \u201cFatty, I\u2019ll be going. We\u2019ll meet again if we get the chance!\u201dA voice rang in fatty\u2019s ear as Zhuo Fan\u2019s figure distanced.\u201cThis kid is perhaps too sharp\u2026 scary even!\u201dWhoosh!It was Fang Qiubai in his blue robe.Fang Qiubai muttered, \u201cThe more I watch him the more he resembles someone!\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d Fatty asked.Fang Qiubai\u2019s eyes flashed, \u201cZhuge Changfeng!\u201d\u201cThe Leader of Four Pillars, Prime Minister Zhuge Changfeng?\u201d Fatty was in shock, \u201cAre you saying Zhuo Fan\u2026\u201dNodding, Fang Qiubai smiled, \u201cCong\u2019er, becoming sworn brothers with him was the best decision you made in your life. One day, he will become one of your Four Pillars, helping you rule!\u201dThe fatty was stunned, watching Zhuo Fan getting further away as ambition flickered in his eyes\u2026Zhuo Fan returned to the small courtyard and saw the others waiting outside.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did 3rd Prince say something?\u201d Luo Yunchang was worried. He refused Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s invitation but this was the Imperial family.With just a nod, he could become an official with the support of the Imperial family.Secretly smiling, Zhuo Fan said, \u201cFatty told me to do my best in fulfilling the secret edict.\u201dLuo Yunchang covered Zhuo Fan\u2019s mouth then looked around before saying, \u201cHow can you call 3rd Prince like that? Be careful or he might take your life!\u201d\u201cHe won\u2019t. He still needs me!\u201dZhuo Fan dismissed her worry and even gave a thumbs up to Luo Yunhai, \u201cYour performance was perfect, worthy of a Clan Head. You made me proud.\u201d\u201cPlease, didn\u2019t I learn it all from bro?\u201dLuo Yunhai stuck up his chin. It was clear the bro he referred to was Zhuo Fan.Everyone laughed and Luo Yunchang showed a relieved smile.[Dad, can you see? Yunhai has grown up. He can shoulder the honor and glory of the Luo clan!] Luo Yunchang looked at the sky with sparkling eyes.On the second day after the meeting, the new clan was established with Luo clan at the helm. The name was, of course, Luo clan. Zhuo Fan, with the Imperial family\u2019s support, had no trouble becoming the Head Steward of the clan, handling all affairs.He appointed Lei Yuntian as Luo clan\u2019s Grand Elder and Cai Rong as the 2nd Elder while keeping Old Pang as the Captain of the guards, leading the Cai clan\u2019s guards. Lei Yuting was made the leader of the shadow corps, taking Blackwind Mountain\u2019s bandits under her, and in charge of intelligence gathering and training assassins.Because of the Imperial family\u2019s decree, the Veiled Dragon Pavilion and Hell Valley were banned from entering the Windgaze City. The rest of the seven houses remained within their borders, thus making this city belong to the Luo clan alone.As for the Luo clan\u2019s estate, Cai clan suggested for it to be the former Cai Manor, but Zhuo Fan had other plans.Blackwind Mountain, the place where a natural array took form!And so, another Devil Mountain was established, and Zhuo Fan\u2019s plans advanced one step at a time\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 - Four Pillars\u2019 LeaderPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe slums in the Imperial Capital were the darkest corners of the empire. Seedy, good, devious, and all other kinds of people mixed in here, along with the downed shacks painted a perfectly wretched image. Any self-respecting man who had some money on the side would never choose to live here.Only those living from one day to the next and the truly poor stayed here, waiting for the day that would rob them of their lives.Yet in the worst corner of the slums was a courtyard the people feared to the point of being afraid to step through its doors. Even if the vilest and most sinister man was to wander by happenstance here, he would be warned to leave this house be.This courtyard was unoccupied, but at night, there were eerie whispers coming from it. Some braved to investigate, but it was as if their traces in this world vanished the moment they stepped foot inside.Recently, some Bone Tempering and even a Profound Heaven expert charged in, fearing no evil.Afterwards, well, there was no news. They were gone all the same. From that moment, the courtyard became a taboo, avoided by the strong and weak alike.On a full moon night, when the slums had turned unusually quiet. The people had gone home earlier and as far away from the demonic courtyard as possible.But it was then that a faint lantern lit up in the courtyard. It was akin to ghost fire, flickering on and off.In a ruined room of the courtyard, an elderly with white temples sat in a pleased manner on a tutor\u2019s chair, waving a goose feathered fan. His half-lidded eyes flashed here and there, and his mouth was twisted at the corners. It was as if the world\u2019s suffering and happiness were beneath him.Two old men stood behind, one with black hair and the other with white hair. Their eyes were closed but their powerful auras identified them as experts, preventing any living creature from approaching a hundred meters around them.Even a harmless beetle would find its tiny heart wreaked with fear.Whoosh!A sound broke the silence and a black-clothed man suddenly appeared outside the room. He had a bamboo hat that hid his features.The sitting old man stopped fanning and smiled, \u201cValley Lord You, how is it progressing?\u201dThe bamboo wearing man was Hell Valley\u2019s Valley Lord, You Wanshan!Sighing, You Wanshan shook his head, \u201cA dozen years of painstaking effort was ruined. The Emperor ordered for Hell Valley to stay away from Windgaze City. The same goes for the other houses. He must have sensed something.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d The old man raised an eyebrow with a smile, \u201cThe Emperor is planning on enacting the Secret Pearl Order?\u201d\u201cMy guess is yes.\u201dYou Wanshan\u2019s face grew angry, \u201cThey got luck on their side last time, but next time, it won\u2019t be so simple. Emperor wants to raise the 8th house, but we shall see if the clan can live to see that day!\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, Valley Lord You, ease your anger. A loss is a loss. Why make excuses?\u201d The old man was still calm, yet his words were sharp and filled with disdain, \u201cHell Valley is one of the Seven Noble Houses, yet it can\u2019t even deal with three common clans. The time of its fall must be close at hand.\u201dYou Wanshan snapped, his power exploding. Peak Profound Heaven cultivation smashed the windows to splinters. He unleashed all of it to pressure the old man.\u201cZhuge Changfeng, you were the one who told me of the contents of the Secret Pearl Order. It was also you who said the Emperor wants to help in the rise of the 8th house. The dozen years plan also came from you. So how can you speak like this?\u201dYou Wanshan bellowed, \u201cGo to hell!\u201dThe smile never left the old man\u2019s face, still sitting calmly and fanning slowly.Boom!Just when the pressure was drawing near Zhuge Changfeng, the black and white elders behind him opened their eyes.At that moment, one\u2019s eyes flashed black while the other\u2019s flashed white. A ripple echoed outwards and clashed with You Wanshan\u2019s display of power, creating a jarring sound.The entire slums shook.You Wanshan\u2019s felt a sweetness in his throat and spat blood as his face paled.The two elders closed their eyes again, while Zhuge Changfeng swayed the fan like nothing had happened, still sporting that ever-present smile.You Wanshan watched the black and white elders incredulously, \u201cYin Yang Elders?\u201dZhuge Changfeng nodded, \u201cValley Lord You sure is knowledgeable. These seniors haven\u2019t shown up over the past century. I find it amazing that you still recognize them.\u201dGrinding his teeth in anger, You Wanshan panted while also spitting blood now and then, but the look he had when he turned to the elders was now one of fear.\u201cYou are worthy of being Tianyu\u2019s number one sage, Four Pillars\u2019s Leader, Prime Minister Zhuge. To be able to make these monsters leave their mountain, not even that Fang Qiubai from the Divine Dragons can compare to you.\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, Valley Lord You is exaggerating. I am not worthy of such a title. I do not dare face the Imperial family in the open just yet.\u201d Zhuge Changfeng let out a short laugh, but the confidence he exuded was unshakable.You Wanshan snorted and muttered, \u201cPrime Minister Zhuge is as modest as he is arrogant. Who in the Tianyu Empire can match your power? Not even the Imperial family can!\u201d\u201cSigh, I can see why you failed in Windgaze City. In this world, strength and weakness aren\u2019t obvious at a glance!\u201d Zhuge Changfeng sighed as he looked at the sky, \u201cFurthermore, I am not the number one sage in Tianyu.\u201d\u201cIf not you, then who?\u201d\u201cThat person above me!\u201d Zhuge Changfeng pointed upward with a grave expression.You Wanshan disdained, \u201cYou\u2019re talking about that senile Emperor?\u201d\u201cSenile?\u201dZhuge Changfeng chuckled, \u201cI\u2019ve been a Prime Minister in the Imperial court for forty years now, and I still can\u2019t read him.\u201d\u201cValley Lord You, go back. Make sure to not cause any further trouble!\u201dZhuge Changfeng swayed his fan as his countenance went back to normal, \u201cBe careful to not give that old man the perfect chance to remove you for good!\u201d\u201cHumph, the Imperial family\u2019s power is hardly enough to deal with my Hell Valley.\u201d You Wanshan grinned, but when he saw the cold look in Zhuge Changfeng\u2019s eye, he didn\u2019t continue. He just cupped his hands and vanished in the night.After You Wanshan left, Zhuge Changfeng took a deep breath and looked to the heavens.\u201cYour Majesty, what is your plan? What is the Secret Pearl Order?\u201d***Three months later, in the Misty Forest at the foot of Blackwind Mountain.Zhuo Fan stood near a frigid blood pool, holding a gourd. His hands performed signs and red dots flew from the pool into the gourd.A smile tugged at Zhuo Fan\u2019s face as he watched the wiggling red dots.This blood pond was something Zhuo Fan made to raise the Frigid Pool Snow Worm. Though, its name should more aptly be Frigid Pool Bloodworm.Zhuo Fan used a secret art from the Nine Serenities Secret Records to train this particular demonic creature. So it not only retained the parasitic ability of the Frigid Pool Snow Worm but it also connected to Zhuo Fan through telepathy. It could now work in tandem with him in performing a secret and evil magic art from the Nine Serenities Secret Records, the Blood Curse.The Blood Curse was a demonic cultivator\u2019s way of controlling his men. Once he put the Blood Curse on someone, they had to obey him for life. If not, the Blood Curse would flare up and the victim would die of blood explosion, a cruel and savage ending.But the Blood Curse had a fatal flaw. If the target was stronger than the caster, the later would be devoured. This wasn\u2019t anything good for Zhuo Fan.But now that Zhuo Fan had the Bloodworm, this flaw could be eliminated. Since the Bloodworm lived in the target\u2019s body, they would never be able to remove the Blood Curse.With this special demonic creature, Zhuo Fan would be in control of a large group of experts to assist him.If anyone heard of this, they\u2019d come to kill Zhuo Fan themselves, even Radiant Stage experts. This demonic creature was an abomination, an affront to Heaven.Any listener would shiver hearing one could make any expert into a slave.With a maniac grin on his face, Zhuo Fan took the gourd filled with Bloodworms and left Misty Forest. He performed a hand sign and the forest\u2019s fog turned bloody, barring any entry.This was his rearing grounds. Why would he ever let another find it?Stashing the gourd in his ring, Zhuo Fan returned to Blackwind Mountain. On his way, he paid attention to every grass, every tree to make sure all was in order.Over the past three months, besides the Imperial family sending thousands of spirit stones and hundreds of pills, the Veiled Dragon Pavilion also sent two thousand spirit stones.He had enough spirit stones on hand that he could flaunt his array grandmaster\u2019s skills. Plus with the natural array here, he could still set up some decent defensive array even without such an amount of spirit stones.To the East of Blackwind Mountain was the Azure Dragon position under the wood attribute. It was a place filled with vitality. As such, Zhuo Fan set up a 5th-grade array, Poison Dragon Array. Poisonous thickets grew inside the array and the miasma above them would never scatter. Even a Profound Heaven expert would find it hard to escape with his life.To the West was the White Tiger position under the metal attribute. It was a place filled with sharp and overgrown plants. Zhuo Fan set up a 5th-grade array, Dazzling Gold Array. Nine suns shined brightly within the array in every direction that no one could walk with their eyes open. Each ray of golden light was like a sharp sword, capable of robbing people of their lives, yet incorporeal.To the South was the Vermilion Bird position of the fire attribute, filled with burning Qi. Zhuo Fan set the 5th-grade array, Blackflame Array. The fires within it were demonic flames that corroded bones. When it entered one\u2019s body, it would be hard to remove, and it wouldn\u2019t stop gnawing until the target was burned to ashes.To the North was the Black Tortoise position of the water attribute, a place filled with piercing chills. Zhuo Fan set up the 5th-grade array, Ice Shadows Array. Howling winds blew within the array\u2019s territory, forming endless illusions. Anyone who entered it would lose their way easily and freeze to death under the bone-piercing coldness that seeped into the victim\u2019s body.Zhuo Fan didn\u2019t tell anyone about the four new arrays. But since today was the day of his departure, he had to give the arrays\u2019 method of control to those he trusted\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She was unclear as to the reason, but she followed nonetheless. She was filled with glee as she saw so many things brought from the Imperial family over the past few days.Especially with two elders standing watch, Luo clan was becoming stronger day by day. She was so moved that she was lost for words. It got so far that she even let Zhuo Fan\u2019s disappearance for these past three months slide.\u201cSteward Zhuo, is there something?\u201dLuo Yunchang smiled as they entered a small room. Zhuo Fan closed the windows and doors without replying. Her thoughts started going in a particular direction and her face flushed.\u201cZhuo Fan, w-what are you trying to do?\u201d Luo Yunchang was bashful.Taking a deep breath, Zhuo Fan began, \u201cI\u2019m leaving!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dLuo Yunchang stood there in shock. She had a face of complete disbelief, wondering if she had heard him wrongly. Only when Zhuo Fan repeated was she certain.\u201cWhy, Luo clan is growing and is already the number one clan in Windgaze City. Why do you want to leave?\u201d\u201cFor Luo clan\u2019s safety!\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s tone was grave, \u201cLuo clan is safe, for now. And there\u2019s no other clan around to mess with it. But remember what we had to do in exchange for all this.\u201d\u201cWe accepted the Imperial family\u2019s vague Secret Pearl Order and offended the Seven Noble Houses\u2019 Hell Valley. As for Veiled Dragon Pavilion, if we do not rise to the level of the seven houses, they will change their stance with us!\u201d\u201cThen we need you even more. What will we do without you?\u201d Luo Yunchang teared up, her heart was unwilling to let him go. In a blink, a glittering tear fell.Wiping her tears away with a gentle touch, Zhuo Fan said, \u201cFatty was right about one thing, a clan\u2019s foundation is strength. I am leaving now to bring back experts for the Luo clan, to protect our future.\u201d\u201cThis is the control method of the four arrays around Blackwind Mountain. Only you must use it. If I\u2019m not back in time, you can activate the arrays to deal with any trouble that arises. These are four 5th-grade arrays, plus the Wraith Array in the Misty Forest, it should defend you for a good while.\u201dZhuo Fan gave a jade slip to Luo Yunchang, who accepted it in tears. She asked softly, \u201cHow long will you be gone?\u201dSighing, Zhuo Fan shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t know. But I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t leaving just to recruit experts, but also to search for the Heavenly Emperor\u2019s remnant Long Jiu talked about, Lightning Canyon. At any given time, raising one\u2019s power was the most basic way to guarantee one\u2019s safety.\u201cAlright, go now. Send Captain Pang and Yunhai in.\u201dNodding, Luo Yunchang left but stopped to kiss Zhuo Fan. He froze for a moment and watched her leave with a deep look.Luo Yunchang blushed but didn\u2019t turn around as she mumbled, \u201cCome back soon.\u201dWhen the words came, she was already gone.Not a moment later, Captain Pang brought Luo Yunhai over. Even they were shocked that Zhuo Fan was leaving.\u201cSilly kid, you\u2019re the only man of the Luo clan. Your sister will have to rely on you in the future. You must act like a true Clan Head who bears the Luo clan\u2019s responsibilities.\u201d Zhuo Fan patted Yunhai\u2019s shoulder.Luo Yunhai nodded while sobbing.Turning to Captain Pang, Zhuo Fan\u2019s hand flashed and revealed a jade slip. But when Captain Pang was about to take it, Zhuo Fan clenched his fist.Captain Pang looked at him in doubt.Zhuo Fan stared hard at him, \u201cPang Yu, do you remember what Long Kui said? She is right, with your talent, you\u2019ll only be a Qi Condensation cultivator at best.\u201dCaptain Pang\u2019s face darkened, his hand shivered and withdrew a bit.\u201cBut,\u201d Zhuo Fan\u2019s tone turned grave, \u201cNothing is set in stone. I have on me a way to change your body anew, to gain incredible power. But the terror you will experience would be worse than death and the pain unimaginable. Are you willing?\u201dCaptain Pang was stunned, then he was overjoyed.\u201cTruly?\u201dNodding, Zhuo Fan raised the jade slip, \u201cThis is a mid profound ranked demonic method, Wraith Art! It is unlike other cultivation methods. It is a cultivation method for the body, ignoring one\u2019s talent for cultivation or his constitution. Just that cultivating it will make your life a living hell. It\u2019s no different from being boiled alive. And once you start, you can never stop or your soul will perish!\u201dCaptain Pang licked his dry lips, yet he wasn\u2019t afraid, his eyes only held excitement.\u201cNo worries. As long as I can become strong, no torment shall best Old Pang.\u201d Captain Pang snatched the jade slip as he shouted.Zhuo Fan reminded him, \u201cThe horrors you will experience from cultivating it aren\u2019t something you can fathom. Maybe you will be under such a pain that your mind will collapse and die in the end. This is a mid profound ranked cultivation method, matching a high profound ranked cultivation method, but with the process being so excruciating, many great demonic cultivators never even dared to touch it. Choose wisely!\u201dWaving his hand, Captain Pang\u2019s eyes flickered.\u201cBrother Zhuo, Old Pang\u2019s only torment in this life was to see Clan Head die before me and unable to stop it. Now, my greatest wish is to protect Young miss and Young master.\u201dCaptain Pang looked gratefully, \u201cBrother Zhuo, thank you for giving me this chance to have no more regrets.\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s heart shivered as he nodded. His eyes held respect.\u201cThe next time we see each other, I hope to see a powerful Old Pang and not a corpse!\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, no worries. I am stubborn, not one to die from just this!\u201d Captain Pang laughed and squeezed Zhuo Fan in a bear hug with moist eyes.\u201cBrother, come back soon. Luo clan won\u2019t be the same without you!\u201dPatting Zhuo Fan\u2019s shoulder, Captain Pang left with Luo Yunhai. Per Zhuo Fan\u2019s instructions, Lei Yuting came soon after.\u201cMiss Lei, how is the task I gave you?\u201d Zhuo Fan smiled.Lei Yuting blushed with a nod, \u201cBrother Zhuo, the six hundred ten-year-old children you asked me to gather are almost here. They all are high talents and await your teachings.\u201dZhuo Fan eyed her then nodded, \u201cHow did you know that I wanted to teach them?\u201dLei Yuting spoke with confidence, \u201cI know you too well to believe that you helped those orphans out of the goodness of your heart. So I guessed you wanted to train them as Luo clan\u2019s guards and make me their leader.\u201dAt her words, Zhuo Fan recalled something and sighed.[Goodness? I once raised an orphan out of kindness and look where it got me. Didn\u2019t he betray me in the end?]Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes flashed coldly at that point, scaring Lei Yuting.\u201cMiss Lei.\u201d Zhuo Fan held a jade slip, \u201cThis is a mid spirit ranked cultivation method, Elusive Shadow Art. Cultivate it and then give it to those you trust to form the shadow corps, protecting the clan in the dark. Begin with the six hundred children the same way I taught you.\u201d\u201cUse the worst of them as guards, the average for the shadow corps, and hand the best among them over to Captain Pang to train them in secret. Pass him my word, he\u2019ll understand.\u201dLei Yuting took the jade slip with a blank look, then stared at Zhuo Fan, her heart uneasy, \u201cWhy not do it yourself?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Lei Yuting asked, \u201cWhy?\u201dZhuo Fan was forced to retell his reasons. Lei Yuting nodded, but before she went out the door, she pecked Zhuo Fan\u2019s cheek.He was floored, watching her dash away in a blink.[What is going on? Do all women like to peck?]Next was Lei Yuntian\u2019s turn. Zhuo Fan explained to him his affairs and Lei Yuntian took his instructions to heart in an honest manner.Although he was the Grand Elder, he was clear Zhuo Fan controlled everything.\u201cElder Lei!\u201dZhuo Fan took out another jade slip, \u201cThis is the profound ranked martial art I recorded after merging the three clans\u2019 martial arts, Thunderwind Sweeping Dragon Art! Since this is part of the Imperial family\u2019s Secret Pearls Order, this will be the Luo clan\u2019s best martial art on the surface. As the Grand Elder, you need to be diligent in practicing it.\u201dLei Yuntian raised an eyebrow but nodded.Zhuo Fan put an emphasis on the words \u2018on the surface\u2019, making it clear he had other high ranked martial arts that the Imperial family was unaware of, his secret weapons.A day may come when the Imperial family might discover that the 8th house they raised was out of their control. But at that time, it would already be too late.Zhuo Fan was young, but his wisdom and shrewdness drew the old man\u2019s admiration.\u201cRest assured, Steward Zhuo, I will be the best Grand Elder there is.\u201d Lei Yuntian laughed, reaching an understanding with Zhuo Fan.Even without Zhuo Fan\u2019s reminder, he was clear what it meant to stand close to a ruler, and that the Imperial family wasn\u2019t to be trusted. But Zhuo Fan gave this old man the nerve to tangle with this behemoth.\u201cRight, Steward Zhuo, what of Cai clan\u2019s father and son?\u201dLei Yuntian frowned, \u201cIts already been three months since the merger of the three clans, but I still feel that the Cai clan is of a different thought, always acting suspiciously. The Blackwind Mountain\u2019s guards have people from the Cai Manor. I fear\u2026\u201d\u201cLet them!\u201dZhuo Fan waved with a smile, \u201cThe Cai clan is part of the Secret Pearl Order. If we deal with them, we\u2019ll earn the Imperial family\u2019s ire. But if they betray us first, he-he-he\u2026\u201dLei Yuntian\u2019s eyes flashed with a nod, \u201cYou\u2019re amazing, Steward Zhuo, to plan so far ahead.\u201dZhuo Fan squinted as killing intent filled his eyes.***On the morning of the second day, Zhuo Fan left Blackwind Mountain all by himself. On the mountain peak, Luo Yunchang, Lei Yuting and Lei Yuntian along with other Luo clan members watched him leave. All except Cai clan\u2019s duo.But in the forest halfway up the mountain, Cai Rong and his son watched Zhuo Fan\u2019s retreating figure with cold eyes.\u201cHumph, without this wretched punk, Luo clan will fall from grace.\u201d Cai Xiaoting snorted, \u201cThat stinky girl, Luo Yunchang, made eyes with Zhuo Fan every single day, not sparing me even a glance. With Zhuo Fan gone, Blackwind Mountain is ours. Let\u2019s see her act haughty now!\u201d\u201cSigh, one must give credit to Zhuo Fan for his rare talent. He has Veiled Dragon Pavilion on his left and 3rd Prince on his right, while he himself has the power to shake the three clans. All of Blackwind Mountain knows the true Clan Head of this merged clan is him.\u201dCai Rong shook his head, \u201cThe most unfortunate thing is that he chose to be against us. Since he is leaving, we might as well take everything back.\u201d\u201cDad, what do we do?\u201d Cai Xiaoting asked.Shaking his head, Cai Rong said, \u201cDon\u2019t be hasty. With Zhuo Fan gone, the Luo clan is nothing. The Lei clan is our true enemy. We need to ally ourselves and become stronger than the Lei clan\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 - Allbeast Mountain RangePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the shadow of a large forest, a black-robed figure stood on the precipice of a mountain. His eyes took in the view of a large city gate with three golden words inscribed on it, Blue Expanse City.Raising the corner of his mouth, the black-robed man left as the wind scattered two piles of black dust.Fifteen minutes later, the man arrived before the city gates.\u201cHold, where\u2019s your pass?\u201dWith a clank, two city guards crossed their spears before the man as they released their 6th layer Qi Condensation cultivation.Taking out a metal tablet with the \u2018serene\u2019 character inscribed on it, the black-robed man let them see it. The guards nodded and let him pass.\u201cEnter!\u201dThe black-robed man quickened his pace but after a hundred meters, he turned his head at the guards, eyeing them with disdain.\u201cUtterly useless!\u201dThe man raised his head and exposed his face. It was Zhuo Fan.It had been a month since he left Luo clan, and this city was his first destination, Blue Expanse City. This place was Hell Valley\u2019s domain. Just how Veiled Dragon Pavilion placed its guards in the Windgaze City, so did Hell Valley in this city.To avoid anyone recognizing him, Zhuo Fan put on a black robe.He braved through this deadly danger because he was left with no other choice. Who told the spiritual beasts to gather on the Allbeast Mountain Range near the Blue Expanse City?This was also why the security was so tight in this city.Be it righteous or demonic cultivators, there were other external means to increase one\u2019s power besides the hard and arduous method of cultivation. Spiritual weapons, demonic treasures, spirit animals, demonic creatures, these were all external means but of significant importance. At the time of peril, it could save one\u2019s life.The late elder of Hell Valley was a good example. Condor Jian Fan\u2019s Soul Devouring Crow had the Purple Lightning Gold Eye and could push back Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s three elders\u2019 joint attack.Long Jiu\u2019s 3rd-grade spiritual weapon was another, helping him push back two Hell Valley\u2019s elders with just a sword.It was obvious how important these external means were to cultivators.Spiritual beasts could be turned into demonic creatures or spirit animals. Righteous cultivators tamed them into spirit animals, while demonic cultivators tamed them into demonic creatures. Zhuo Fan\u2019s Blood Infant which was born naturally was an exception.The Blue Expanse City was taken by Hell Valley during the founding of the Tianyu Empire. As such, any cultivator wanting to get his spirit animal or demonic creature would have to obtain Hell Valley\u2019s approval.And Hell Valley used this as a pretext to set up a checkpoint half a mile around it to confirm everyone\u2019s identities, allowing entry to only those with a pass.But how could Zhuo Fan expose himself and offer himself up on a chopping block?So he killed two righteous cultivators outside, stole their pass, and waltzed right in.\u201cHumph, Hell Valley can only intimidate some shy disciples with this. You think this is enough to deal with a bold cultivator or a Profound Heaven expert?\u201d Zhuo Fan\u2019s mouth let out snide remarks as he walked on.He came all this way to Allbeast Mountain Range looking for a rare 6th level spiritual beast, Thunder Skylark!Entering Lightning Canyon could only be done through the purple lightning. Zhuo Fan was certain Long Jiu\u2019s 3rd Heaven purple lightning wasn\u2019t the same as the lightning from that place, or it would\u2019ve reached the 6th Heaven.That kind of power was a deterrence even for a Radiant Stage expert.So before he cleared Lightning Canyon\u2019s restrictions, he had to first find a way to guarantee his life in that place. And the Thunder Skylark, a creature that lived by swallowing lightning, was a perfect choice.When he\u2019d made it his demonic creature that matched the Demon Transformation Art, he\u2019d have no trouble getting in.Zhuo Fan hoped Lightning Canyon\u2019s purple lightning wasn\u2019t higher than 6th Heaven, or not even the Thunder Skylark would survive repeated blows to its body and turn to ash.If that happens, then he\u2019d only be waiting for his death.Zhuo Fan took a deep breath and picked up the pace. If not for Heavenly Emperor\u2019s remnant, he\u2019d never dare go through such danger.Bam!As he walked, a black figure knocked into his chest. Zhuo Fan looked down to find a little beggar in shabby clothes.Zhuo Fan was enraged, but before he could curse, here came the little beggar\u2019s pleading voice, \u201cPlease, don\u2019t shout!\u201dZhuo Fan frowned. Then, from his back, a group of thirty Qi Condensation cultivators appeared.Because the beggar hid in front of Zhuo Fan, his black cloak was wide enough to hide the beggar.\u201cAny sign of him?\u201d\u201cNone!\u201d\u201cWhat are you standing around for? Find him! If we don\u2019t find him, master will have our heads.\u201d A steward cursed. The others only nodded as they scattered.Once they were gone, the beggar looked up with a relieved breath and patted his chest, \u201cScared me to death. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d make it.\u201dZhuo Fan ignored him and walked away.\u201cEh, brother\u2026\u201dThe beggar was stunned for a second then swooped in to block Zhuo Fan\u2019s path. He had a dark and dirty face but sported an extra big smile as he said, \u201cThank you for earlier. If it weren\u2019t for you\u2026\u201dBut Zhuo Fan kept walking.The beggar stood there blinking then hurriedly caught up with Zhuo Fan, \u201cBrother, did you come from outside the city? Can you take me outside, please?\u201d\u201cIf you want to leave, do it alone. You don\u2019t need a pass to go out!\u201d Zhuo Fan dodged him.The little beggar\u2019s face was bitter as he bit his lip and sniffed twice as tears rolled down his cheeks, \u201cBrother, to be honest, I stole from them. If they catch me, I\u2019m a goner. Please, take me outside.\u201dSmiling, Zhuo Fan eyed him, \u201cAround fifteen-sixteen years old and a 4th layer Qi Condensation cultivator. You\u2019re not weak for your age. There\u2019s no way a commoner can have such cultivation. Are you truly a beggar?\u201dThe beggar stopped crying and his eyes darted everywhere as if looking for an excuse.Zhuo Fan continued with a smile, \u201cAnd even if you\u2019re sincere, why should I help you and offend a powerful clan? I see no reason why I need to help you!\u201dZhuo Fan then shook his head and walked past him. The beggar stood frozen in his spot, not knowing what to do. He didn\u2019t think Zhuo Fan was pragmatic.From the start, the beggar thought Zhuo Fan to be a kind youth since he helped him once.\u201cDon\u2019t you want to go to the Allbeast Mountain Range?\u201d The beggar shouted.Zhuo Fan halted his steps, \u201cAll who come here are looking to go to the Allbeast Mountain Range. What else is here, visiting Hell Valley\u2019s cemetery?\u201dThe beggar was stunned by his words, [This kid sure has an attitude. Isn\u2019t he afraid of being killed for cursing Hell Valley?]But the more Zhuo Fan acted as such, the weirder the beggar\u2019s eyes turned.\u201cYou\u2019ll have to wait for three months before going to Allbeast Mountain Range.\u201dZhuo Fan stopped with a frown, \u201cWhy?\u201dThe beggar skipped to him with a smile, \u201cLet me tell you, the Diamond Sand is about to come out on Allbeast Mountain Range. These past months Hell Valley sealed the whole mountain range for this precise reason.\u201dDiamond Sand?Zhuo Fan was secretly overjoyed.The Diamond Sand was known as the blood of the earth, rare and difficult to obtain. It was used for refining 5th-grade spiritual weapons. But what made it even more valuable was that it was a flowing spirit metal, a perfect match for his Blood Infant.His Blood Infant was close to breaking through to Bone Tempering Stage and he needed to refine its body. At that time, Blood Infant could switch between being corporeal and illusive, killing people without leaving tracks. Refining it with a hundred spirit metals would turn it as hard as a demonic treasure and it would become difficult to cause any harm to it.He could also achieve a similar result by refining Blood Infant with Diamond Sand. If he was able to do it, then he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about obtaining 100 spirit metals. And with a body refined from Diamond Sand, facing a Profound Heaven expert would be a cinch.Thinking of this, Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes flashed with excitement.The beggar saw through Zhuo Fan and coughed as he raised his head with pride, \u201cLet\u2019s make a deal. If you take me outside the city, I will take you to Allbeast Mountain Range. And when the Diamond Sand erupts, we can take advantage of their carelessness and steal a bit.\u201dZhuo Fan secretly snickered. There was no way Hell Valley didn\u2019t prepare for this. But the fact that he had a guide to enter Allbeast Mountain Range without them knowing was a nice bonus.\u201cDeal!\u201dThe beggar raised his hand and winked.Zhuo Fan shook his head and slapped the beggar\u2019s hand.\u201cHa-ha-ha, awesome. I finally found someone to take me out of this damnable place.\u201d The beggar laughed while jumping around. \u201cBrother, what\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cZhuo Fan!\u201dZhuo Fan was blunt because he knew even though Hell Valley was aware of the Luo clan, his title as a steward wasn\u2019t well known. And the only one who knows that he killed two of their elders was Yang Ming. But would anyone believe him even if he said it?Zhuo Fan was confident that Yang Ming would let this matter fester inside him. If anyone knew that Elder Jian died at the hands of a Qi Condensation punk, yet he survived, his future would be bleak, if not cut short.Moreover, even if he did speak up, Hell Valley would never announce it. Could they afford to lose any more reputation?The beggar laughed, \u201cBrother Zhuo, call me Xiao Ning.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201d Zhuo Fan nodded, not carrying much because he knew it was fake.The beggar pouted, looking at him with a deep look full of curiosity. Zhuo Fan gave him a different impression from all those he had seen before, simply mysterious\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Little beggar shivered, turning his head shyly.With slow footsteps, what appeared before the two was an elegant young master in white with tied hair. He was in front of 20 Qi Condensation experts donning the same clothes as the ones from the previous group.The young master ignored Zhuo Fan and glared at the beggar with rage, \u201cYou\u2019ve caused enough trouble. It\u2019s time you return.\u201dBiting his lip, the beggar\u2019s eyes looked uncertain, but soon he came to a decision and stared back with a firm gaze. He dodged behind Zhuo Fan with a yell, \u201cBrother Zhuo, save me.\u201dThe young master finally picked up on Zhuo Fan\u2019s presence, merely glancing his phoenix eyes his way, \u201cThis concerns our Xue clan. If sir does not want any trouble, I suggest you leave.\u201dXue clan?Zhuo Fan quirked an eyebrow and stared long at the beggar, [I didn\u2019t think this buddy had offended the Xue clan.]Xue clan was the number one common clan in Blue Expanse City. It had a Profound Heaven expert as overseer and could be considered a 2nd rate clan on the continent.But as Blue Expanse City was under Hell Valley\u2019s control, Xue clan was nothing more than its vassal.Zhuo Fan saw the beggar pleading with his eyes and smiled as he drew the beggar closer. The young master squinted and paled. The beggar was also surprised and a faint red tint made itself notice on his dirty cheeks.\u201cKid, what do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d The young master bellowed.Zhuo Fan snickered, \u201cFrom now on, he\u2019s under me. If you want him, you\u2019ll have to pass through me first!\u201d\u201cAbsurd! Did you come to Blue Expanse City without even knowing of our Xue clan? Is our clan someone you can offend?\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha,\u201d Zhuo Fan laughed and shook his head, \u201cOf course I know. Xue clan is Hell Valley\u2019s number one dog in Blue Expanse City. You\u2019re telling me to ignore all those rare and amazing spiritual beasts on Allbeast Mountain Range for a lame dog?\u201dThe young master was about to explode from anger. The beggar was also angry and pushed Zhuo Fan, \u201cDon\u2019t talk of Xue clan like that!\u201dZhuo Fan was stunned. [I am venting your anger yet you still blame me?]\u201cMen, seize them!\u201dAs Zhuo Fan was lost for words, the young master bellowed orders.The men behind him swarmed the two. The beggar woke up to who the enemy was and hid behind Zhuo Fan.Sneering, Zhuo Fan picked up on the fact that these guards were mostly 5th layer Qi Condensation cultivators, with only two in the 6th layer.\u201cA bunch of fishes looking for death!\u201dZhuo Fan attacked with disdain. His hand flashed red and struck with Blood Palm!It hit a guard\u2019s chest, and the victim felt all his blood vessels burst and his organs expand to the point of bursting. He spat blood before collapsing.Another palm flew and the next guard fell.This pattern went on and on\u2026The group of twenty guards fell one by one under Zhuo Fan\u2019s onslaught.The young master had long been standing there in shock. Even with his 8th layer Qi Condensation cultivation, he would be unable to deal with 20 men like Zhuo Fan did.It was clear that Zhuo Fan was only in the 5th layer, yet his simple palm dealt each guard a serious wound.What escaped his eyes though, was that Zhuo Fan\u2019s Blood Palm bypassed a person flesh and struck at the blood vessels. It was the same as ignoring the body\u2019s defense and attacking the vulnerable organs within, so of course, it was far deadlier than it looked.In but a few breaths, all guards were on the ground, knocked out.The young master witnessed it all with a solemn expression. The beggar\u2019s eyes also bulged in wonder.\u201cSo you do know a thing or two, kid. No wonder you\u2019re so smug.\u201d The young master gnashed his teeth and jumped, shattering the stones beneath his feet, \u201cThen let me, Xue Gang, coerce sir with my high martial arts!\u201d\u201cXue Gang?\u201dZhuo Fan frowned, \u201cAre you Xue clan\u2019s young master? I heard your dad pampers you and you are to be the clan\u2019s successor!\u201d\u201cSo, are you afraid perchance?\u201d Xue Gang shouted.Zhuo Fan shook his head, \u201cNo, I just don\u2019t like annoyances. If I offend you here, my days in Blue Expanse City will be harder. It\u2019s best to\u2026 shut all these people up for good and bring peace to my ears!\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s eyes flashed with killing intent and shot forward. Such pressure from him squeezed at Xue Gang\u2019s heart.He never dreamed Zhuo Fan would dare to kill him. The naked killing intent made his Yuan Qi slow down, even if he was 3 layers higher than Zhuo Fan.He, who was praised to high heaven for his talent in cultivation, couldn\u2019t foresee the world housing such a ruthless youth. A mere 5th layer Qi Condensation cultivator was able to overwhelm an expert 3 layers higher.He watched in abject fear as the palm neared his chest and was moments away from rupturing his heart. But in this moment of impending crisis, he bit his tongue to wake up. The pain freed him from the killing intent\u2019s horrifying grip.With no time to lose, he punched. Blue lights shot like a tornado at Zhuo Fan.\u201cHigh mortal ranked martial art, Howling Fist!\u201dZhuo Fan snorted in disdain and made a hand sign so that a red light flew right into Xue Gang\u2019s body.Before the Howling Fist even touched Zhuo Fan, it broke apart and Xue Gang\u2019s body froze on the spot in panic.At this moment Zhuo Fan towered over him. Seeing Zhuo Fan\u2019s devious grin, Xue Gang felt like he was looking at a demon and his heart seized up for a few seconds.Bam!Zhuo Fan\u2019s palm landed on his chest and Xue Gang spat blood as he flew into the air. His organs felt like they were burning and his blood vessels began to rupture.But the pain had yet to register when the demon approached. Xue Gang was so scared he was having a mental breakdown.This was Zhuo Fan!He didn\u2019t strike with another palm and instead, Zhuo Fan grabbed Xue Gang\u2019s neck with a sneer, \u201cYoung master Xue, worry not. After you die, your servants will follow in your footsteps, down to the last one. This should keep the Xue clan from chasing me all over for at least three months. Let\u2019s make this case\u2026 cold.\u201dZhuo Fan tightened the chokehold and Xue Gang felt his throat almost breaking, he could even hear his bones creak.He was on the brink of death. Besides agony, nothing else was felt.Not for the life of him could he understand what he did wrong. Wasn\u2019t he only going to bring Ning\u2019er back? Why did he meet a reaper instead? A ruthless killer![I forgot to read my future before heading out!]If his neck wasn\u2019t being crushed by Zhuo Fan, he\u2019d be wailing and bawling. [Damn it, what rotten luck!]\u201cStop!\u201dJust when Zhuo Fan wanted to apply the last bit of force and send the young master to paradise, the beggar yelled.Zhuo Fan eyed him suspiciously, \u201cWhat are you doing? Aren\u2019t they your enemies?\u201dThe beggar was filled with worry for Xue Gang\u2019s life that even tears formed in his eyes. In fact, he wanted to stop Zhuo Fan long ago, but Zhuo Fan was just too fast. He dealt with the guards in one moment, and in the next, he was at Xue Gang\u2019s throat.\u201cEven if they are, I don\u2019t want to kill them!\u201d The beggar cried.Zhuo Fan frowned, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so? But it\u2019s too late now. They are no longer just your enemies, they are mine too. The only ending for my enemies is death!\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s hand tightened and Xue Gang\u2019s eyes bulged out. He wasn\u2019t far off from dying.\u201cIf you don\u2019t release him, I won\u2019t guide you.\u201d The beggar yelled in tears.Zhuo Fan frowned. This was his first time seeing a person shed tears for their enemies.He let go and Xue Gang dropped on the ground. Zhuo Fan made a sign and Blood Infant returned as he shrugged, \u201cSince you aren\u2019t scared, why would I be over some future inconvenience?\u201dHe wiped the tears off the beggar\u2019s little face and walked away while holding the beggar close, \u201cShow the way, then I will take you outside the city, far from Xue clan.\u201d\u201cY-you baddie!\u201d The little beggar stammered.Zhuo Fan sneered, \u201cCorrect, I\u2019m a bad man! But in this world, they are the only ones who can survive. The good guys have already left for hell.\u201dThe beggar wiped his tears and looked at Zhuo Fan, unafraid.He had seen his fair share of bad people, but none rose to Zhuo Fan\u2019s level. Yet he never felt any hatred for Zhuo Fan as he did for others, instead, he felt at ease.This feeling he didn\u2019t express, but it felt nice anyway\u2026An hour later, a black figure appeared standing in Zhuo Fan\u2019s previous position. The old man\u2019s beard shivered from rage at the sight of the guards on the ground.He noticed Xue Gang twitching on the ground, helped him up, and asked nervously, \u201cGang\u2019er, what\u2019s wrong? Who did this to you?\u201dXue Gang gasped with a pale face, yet not one word was uttered. The old man looked him over and found that only Xue Gang\u2019s insides were wounded, while below him was a puddle of water.He gave Xue Gang a pill then let out a long breath.But Xue Gang\u2019s injury astonished him.His wound wasn\u2019t heavy, only needing a month to heal. But his mind, however, had received a heavy shock. He was frightened so badly he peed himself![Gang\u2019er is a bold youth. Only a dreadful expert could have scared him to such a state in such a short time.]The old man was bewildered as he pondered for a long time. In the end, he shook his head and left with Xue Gang.No matter who it was, any who dared offend Xue clan in Blue Expanse City would have another thing coming\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But to do it without anyone noticing was the problem.Any noise here would attract the elder from Hell Valley stationed within. And since Xue clan\u2019s Profound Heaven expert was after him, he\u2019d have a hard time coming out alive.After careful deliberation, Zhuo Fan shook his head. He\u2019d have to rely on the little beggar if he wanted to go within the mountain\u2019s range.\u201cXiao Ning, where\u2019s the secret tunnel?\u201dZhuo Fan looked at the little beggar, the latter was still feeling afraid of what he had witnessed some time ago. He wasn\u2019t crying but still sniffed.\u201cC-come with me.\u201d said the little beggar while sniffing hard, then he and Zhuo Fan vanished from the bushes.Zhuo Fan felt helpless. [Why is this kid more of a coward than a mouse? Ever since he saw what I did, he keeps crying from fear, even now.][They were the enemies chasing you down, not your family. So why are you crying so hard?]Zhuo Fan secretly cursed but was resigned to his fate. Who told him to agree to this little beggar\u2019s deal? He imagined that after he followed the beggar to the mountain, he\u2019d be facing some ferocious spiritual beasts while the beggar kept crying at the side.Sighing, Zhuo Fan travelled with the beggar through a dark forest. After a long time, they found a narrow tunnel next to a hidden stream.\u201cT-this is it.\u201d The beggar forced himself to stop sobbing, but his body still shivered, \u201cW-when I was little, I used to play with my dad and brothers in these woods!\u201dZhuo Fan lifted an eyebrow as he inspected the cave and the surroundings. It was such a remote place that only a native would know of.He guessed that the little beggar must have stumbled upon this cave when he was playing with his brothers, or the Hell Valley would\u2019ve sealed it by now if they knew of it.\u201cAlright, Xiao Ning. Go in first, I\u2019ll be right behind you!\u201dZhuo Fan shouted as he pushed the little beggar in. He didn\u2019t think this place held a trap, but his years and years of experience still showed his cautious nature.The little beggar was aware of the meaning and rolled his eyes in anger, and stooped to go in.Suddenly, a loud shout was heard.\u201cNing\u2019er, stop!\u201dWhoosh!With a sound of the wind, a large figure blocked the two\u2019s path. The man looked like he was in his forties and wore luxurious clothing over his tall and sturdy body. His pair of large eyes flashed with the explosive power of an expert.\u201cPeak Bone Tempering expert!\u201dZhuo Fan frowned and his hands tightened, \u201cAre you the Clan Head of the Xue clan, Xue Wanlong?\u201cGood eyes!\u201dXue Wanlong praised, \u201cWhere you the one who harmed my eldest son, Xue Gang?\u201d\u201cIndeed,\u201d Zhuo Fan smiled, \u201cHe wanted to take one of my people. Sparing him was already kind enough!\u201d\u201cWhat, yours?\u201dXue Wanlong was shocked and turned to the little beggar. The little beggar blushed as he hid behind Zhuo Fan.Xue Wanlong\u2019s expression turned weird.\u201cDad!\u201dJust then, a yell was heard. A youth in white landed next to Xue Wanlong, \u201cHa-ha-ha, I knew Ning\u2019er would be hiding here.\u201d\u201cDad, let me help you take him back!\u201dThe youth looked thrilled. He disregarded Zhuo Fan and flew to the little beggar.[Bastard, this kid is way too cocky, treating me like air!]Zhuo Fan squinted and secretly cursed. When the youth was close to him, he struck with a red palm.The youth felt his energy turn sluggish and his blood vessels rupture. In this moment of deadly crisis, Zhuo Fan struck like lightning and grabbed his neck.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Xue Wanlong roared.He didn\u2019t think his son would be caught so easily.To be honest, he saw Zhuo Fan as a 5th layer Qi Condensation cultivator and was still skeptical of how he hurt his eldest son and guards.But now he knew.Compared to the kids he raised in his clan with all his heart, Zhuo Fan was akin to a savage beast bathed in blood. He was weaker, but his timing was perfect and his methods vicious.Before Zhuo Fan, his two sons were nothing more than greenhouse flowers.With a snicker, Zhuo Fan raised the youth up high, \u201cA 5th layer Qi Condensation cultivator. He must be your second son, Xue Lin, right?\u201d\u201cRelease him now, or you won\u2019t make it out alive!\u201d Xue Wanlong roared in anger.Sneering, Zhuo Fan shook his head, \u201cIf I do as you say, you\u2019d make sure I\u2019m dead even more!\u201d\u201cClan Head Xue, no matter what grievances Xiao Ning has with you, he is my person. I only hope you will give up at this point. Don\u2019t\u2026\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s hand squeezed and Xue Lin gasped with his tongue out, \u201cAnd you will have your son as a corpse!\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dThe little beggar shouted before Xue Wanlong could reply, grabbing Zhuo Fan\u2019s arm and begging with his eyes.Zhuo Fan was stunned, [This beggar must have a screw loose. Why does he want to leave his enemies alive?]Xue Wanlong watched them with a complicated gaze. But soon came to a decision and calmed down.This, in turn, startled Zhuo Fan.\u201cKid, what is your name?\u201d Xue Wanlong asked.Zhuo Fan smiled, \u201cI am alone and am not afraid of your revenge. Nor am I afraid of telling you my name. It\u2019s Zhuo Fan!\u201d\u201cAlright, Zhuo Fan! You want to protect him no matter what?\u201d Xue Wanlong pointed at the little beggar with a solemn look.Zhuo Fan snorted, \u201cHe is mine, so of course I will!\u201d\u201cGood, then let\u2019s make a bet. You let my son go and take ten hits from me. If you win, I will no longer care about him. What do you say?\u201dSquinting, Zhuo Fan considered Xue Wanlong\u2019s bet, then showed his manic grin as he threw Xue Lin away.\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid I will break my word?\u201d Xue Wanlong\u2019s eyes flashed.Zhuo Fan sneered, \u201cIf I want to kill him, you won\u2019t be able to stop me!\u201d\u201cBig words!\u201d Xue Wanlong was angry again, \u201cHere are my ten moves!\u201dHe charged with his peak Bone Tempering power on display. But Zhuo Fan didn\u2019t seem to feel any discomfort, standing there calmly.Xue Wanlong\u2019s brow trembled as he secretly praised Zhuo Fan.But before he reached Zhuo Fan, the later also charged. This puzzled him greatly.[Even if this kid is a seasoned fighter, he can\u2019t fend off a Bone Tempering expert! So why\u2026]He saw Zhuo Fan\u2019s hand shine and Savage Moon appear.Basked in a silver glow, Zhuo Fan sped up and was before Xue Wanlong in an instant, ready to attack.\u201c3rd-grade demonic treasure?\u201dXue Wanlong was shocked and turned to the side in an attempt to dodge.But a red light darted out from Zhuo Fan, aimed at Xue Wanlong.\u201cGot you!\u201dZhuo Fan grinned with killing intent.But just as Blood Infant was about to enter Xue Wanlong, it was repelled. As it bounced off, Zhuo Fan felt his blood stirring from his connection with it. His hand moved and he slashed with Savage Moon.The silver light trailed past Xue Wanlong\u2019s face.When both of them stopped, Zhuo Fan was standing in Xue Wanlong\u2019s original place with a solemn look. Just now he had planned to take Xue Wanlong\u2019s life in one hit by using Blood Infant and Savage Moon.But unexpectedly, Blood Infant bounced off and the recoil veered his attack.He turned back to see Xue Wanlong\u2019s chest flash, and shouted, \u201c2nd-grade defensive demonic treasure?\u201dHis heart grew heavy having found out the reason.Against such a defensive demonic treasure, his Qi Condensation Blood Infant was useless. He could only rely on Savage Moon in this battle.As Zhuo Fan felt gloomy about the upcoming fight, Xue Wanlong\u2019s jaw dropped in shock.He didn\u2019t foresee that a 5th layer Qi Condensation kid would have such terrifying power. If he was a moment too late, his head would\u2019ve been sent flying right now.Recalling his bet with Zhuo Fan, he felt a cold shiver run down his spine.[Blast it, as the matter stands, it\u2019ll be good if I can at least keep my head after ten moves!]He then looked at the chain mail on his chest and sighed. Thanks to his father warning him that the man who took Ning\u2019er might have been an expert, he wore this armor.He was unclear as to what was Blood Infant\u2019s use, but he knew death wouldn\u2019t be far away once it got into his body.Then he turned to Zhuo Fan, who was looking at him as if to devour him, and broke out in cold sweat.This was his first time meeting such a dreadful opponent. Even more so when this opponent was in the 5th layer of Qi Condensation!\u201cDamn it. Is this kid a monster?\u201d Gnashing his teeth, Xue Wanlong braced himself for what\u2019s to come\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 - Mystifying Phantom StepPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhuo Fan stared at Xue Wanlong, thinking hard for a way to finish his enemy. Xue Wanlong was the same, yet his eyes seemed lost.He saw no hesitation from Zhuo Fan, but a naked taunt instead. This was not how a Qi Condensation cultivator was supposed to stare at a Bone Tempering expert. It was more akin to a savage beast staring down its prey, and he didn\u2019t like it one bit.[Being stared down by someone weaker than me feels like I\u2019ve lost all respect.]He decided to rush for an attack and strike awe in this kid.But Zhuo Fan got ahead of him and ran for him first.\u201cSecond move!\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s sudden action startled him, but soon recalled who he was. Even if it was against a punk, he wasn\u2019t about to make a fool of himself.Moreover, only Savage Moon was a threat to him. If he paid attention to it, he\u2019d be fine. It would be no problem lasting ten moves.If his thoughts were known to others, it would leave them speechless.In a fight between Peak Bone Tempering expert and a Qi Condensation kid, the former who thought this was but a cat and mouse game was now thinking how to survive ten moves.Who the hell was strong and who was weak then? And more importantly, who in the hell told him to make a 10 moves bet in the first place?But he had no time to mind such trifles as Zhuo Fan had turned into a silver light. Seeing the silver light approach him, Xue Wanlong exploded with power and retreated. It could be said that he was being wary of Savage Moon, but he was even more afraid that he would end up making an embarrassing scene!Xue Lin, who was thrown down, coughed twice then stared in shock, \u201cDad, you were the one who brought up the ten moves bet, not the other way around!\u201dXue Wanlong\u2019s face froze, itching to run over and kick his son\u2019s rear real good. [Can you be even more oblivious? This kid\u2019s toy is sharp and you want me to play around with death?]Xue Lin was ignorant of his dad\u2019s struggle and kept cheering. But Xue Wanlong\u2019s face was getting more and more ashen!Zhuo Fan didn\u2019t even get to touch Xue Wanlong\u2019s clothes in the first 5 moves. But he saw through Xue Wanlong\u2019s intention and became bold.With a manic grin, Zhuo Fan declared, \u201cSixth move!\u201dHe sped up for another attack while Xue Wanlong was prepared to dodge.But this time, Zhuo Fan stepped lightly and turned into three figures, surrounding Xue Wanlong. Three silver lights approached Xue Wanlong in a threatening manner from different directions.Xue Wanlong was startled. But as a Peak Bone Tempering expert, he didn\u2019t lose his calm. He kicked the ground and made it explode. The force helped him dodge backwards, almost enough to escape the encirclement.But Zhuo Fan sneered and stepped again!Whoosh!The images dissipated. However, Zhuo Fan appeared from behind Xue Wanlong and cut past his ear!\u201cLow spirit ranked martial art, Mystifying Phantom Step!\u201dThe two stopped again, with Zhuo Fan standing three meters away from his opponent with a smile. Xue Wanlong stood there watching a strand of black hair floating before him.\u201cI-I lost!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t believe it. What was meant to be a test for the kid, ended with his complete loss in the 6th move.He didn\u2019t sense Zhuo Fan behind him, but since Zhuo Fan could cut his hair just as well, it could\u2019ve been his head.In other words, Zhuo Fan was going easy on him.Xue Wanlong swallowed dryly. He was going all out from the 2nd move. But even so\u2026\u201cImpossible!\u201dThe beggar and Xue Lin yelled at the same time. They found it hard to accept that such a powerful expert lost to their peer.\u201cDad, you must\u2019ve gone easy on purpose, right?\u201d Xue Lin ran next to Xue Wanlong with expectation in his eyes. But Xue Wanlong didn\u2019t comment.Zhuo Fan watched them coldly, \u201cOf course Clan Head Xue went easy. His first move was just a test, without killing intent!\u201d\u201cIf dad hadn\u2019t gone easy, you\u2019d be dead!\u201d Xue Lin was grasping for straws here when he stuck out his chin in derision.But Zhuo Fan just sneered, \u201cTerribly sorry, your dad didn\u2019t go all out. But if he had, his head would\u2019ve been lying on the ground by now!\u201dZhuo Fan wasn\u2019t saying to scare people.Although his first attempt with Blood Infant failed, it only meant that he lost the initiative completely. And that didn\u2019t equal losing his chance to kill Xue Wanlong.A Bone Tempering expert lacked speed in comparison to a Profound Heaven expert. With Savage Moon\u2019s assist, Zhuo Fan\u2019s speed matched a Bone Tempering expert. So, he still had a chance with his speed.What was left then was to deliver a killing blow at the perfect timing!If Zhuo Fan was in the 4th layer of Qi Condensation, it would\u2019ve been impossible. But in the 5th layer, he could use spirit ranked martial arts.And the first one he trained was Mystifying Phantom Step.This was not your average martial art, but one coming from Nine Serenities Secret Records, a rare martial art that made use of an array\u2019s advantage. The phantom part wasn\u2019t important, but it was crucial to bait the opponent. The true killing move came from the mystified path he drew his opponent in.With this martial art, Zhuo Fan could teleport anywhere within a short-range.During their fight, the phantoms took all of Xue Wanlong\u2019s attention and made him ignore the sudden appearance of Zhuo Fan behind him.If Zhuo Fan had sensed any killing intent in their fight, he would\u2019ve chopped Xue Wanlong\u2019s head off.Xue Wanlong was more than clear on this and accepted his defeat.\u201cZhuo Fan,\u201d With a sigh, Xue Wanlong stared at him solemnly, \u201cYou\u2019re the most reliable youth I\u2019ve ever seen. I will leave Ning\u2019er with you. Don\u2019t fail him!\u201dZhuo Fan was puzzled, [What does he mean by that?]But Xue Wanlong didn\u2019t explain and hugged the little beggar.\u201cNing\u2019er, go and don\u2019t return. Follow your dreams!\u201d\u201cDad!\u201d The little beggar cried rivers. Zhuo Fan watched in shock, [Dad? When did Xue Wanlong have a third son?]But soon, he yelled, \u201cHold on, you\u2019re 3rd Young miss, Xue Ningxiang?\u201dRolling his eyes, Xue Wanlong patted Zhuo Fan\u2019s shoulder, \u201cKid, I thought you were smart, but you found this out only now! Anyway, you said it yourself that she is yours, so I am leaving her in your care. If I find out that you mistreated my daughter in any way, I will wring your life from your body!\u201d\u201cN-o way! W-what is going on here?\u201dZhuo Fan was slack-jawed. All this time he\u2019d been fighting the little beggar\u2019s father and was so close to ending her entire family. [It\u2019s obvious now why she always glared at me with such hatred.]Sighing, Xue Wanlong took one last look at his tearing daughter and left with Xue Lin.After going some distance, Xue Lin said, \u201cDad, if we don\u2019t get Ning\u2019er back, how do we explain it to Hell Valley\u2026\u201d\u201cQuiet, I have a way!\u201d***\u201cXue Ningxiang!\u201dZhuo Fan stepped before the little beggar and tossed her cap. Jet-black silky hair cascaded.The little beggar, who was still lost in tears as she watched her father leave, yelped when this happened and hurriedly held her head. She faced him with a blushed face but didn\u2019t meet his eyes.\u201cMiss Ning, what\u2019s your game? Here I was fighting with your father thinking of helping you vent your anger but, in fact, it was for nothing!\u201dXue Ningxiang took two steps back, muttering as she looked at his angry face, \u201cBrother Zhuo, don\u2019t be angry. I only want to leave the city while you want to go to Allbeast Mountain Range. We\u2019ll each get what we want!\u201dZhuo Fan was startled. [Then again, she\u2019s right!][As long as I get what I want, who cares if they\u2019re a family of archenemies?][Each gets what he wants. This missy speaks reason. Will I, Demonic Emperor, get angry because she lied to me? Anyway, this has nothing to do with me!]But then Zhuo Fan was startled once again.[Since when have I been so emotional?]With a frown, Zhuo Fan recalled everything that happened since his rebirth. He then realised that being in contact with the Luo clan over the past months made him show consideration to the people around him, even without his knowledge. This wasn\u2019t how a demonic cultivator acted at all![Damn it, I don\u2019t need these useless feelings. I have to change.][I have to!]Zhuo Fan reminded himself again and again. His face then turned serene, void of any emotion.\u201cXue Ningxiang, let\u2019s go!\u201d Zhuo Fan pointed at the cave and said in a cold tone, \u201cOnce I\u2019m done with Allbeast Mountain Range, I will take you out. At that time, our deal is done!\u201dXue Ningxiang looked long at him then nodded. Zhuo Fan\u2019s behavior changed way too fast as if he was a different person.To begin with, Zhuo Fan wasn\u2019t a good man in her mind but now he became neither good nor bad, but cold and unfeeling\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Suddenly, the rabbit straightened its ears and bolted.A moment later, a black hand extended out from the ground followed by the slow crawl of the little beggar. But as she was crawling, she was flung out with a loud sound, as if a palm had slapped her.\u201cGet out already!\u201dZhuo Fan scowled and came out after the beggar flew. He was just as filthy as the beggar and looked as if he had crawled through a cramped coal mine.The tunnel was winding and almost half a mile long, it was also damp and smelled of rot. He couldn\u2019t understand for the life of him what was so great about playing in this place as kids?Xue Ningxiang got on her feet, rubbed her rear and then glared at him, \u201cYou\u2019re the worst. I show you the way and this is my thanks?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m a scoundrel!\u201dZhuo Fan didn\u2019t argue with her and had his eyes peeled, scanning the surrounding as he heard the seldom roar of spiritual beasts. He now knew that this was indeed Allbeast Mountain Range.Looking at his filthy appearance, he shook his head and turned to Xue Ningxiang, \u201cHey, is there any river nearby?\u201dRolling her eyes, Xue Ningxiang began walking, \u201cFollow me!\u201dZhuo Fan smiled and followed her.Fifteen minutes later, the sound of water reached their ears. He perked up and sped.His eyes were soon rewarded with the sight of a wide river flowing with clear water and small fishes.With a shout, Zhuo Fan leapt in despite a female\u2019s presence. His clothes then flew out.Xue Ningxiang whipped her body around in shame and snapped, \u201cYou rogue, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think, bathing!\u201dZhuo Fan snorted as he bathed with no regard to her presence, \u201cI\u2019ll get out after I finish. Do what you want! If you wish, we can bathe together, I don\u2019t mind!\u201d\u201cDamn you, who wants to bathe with you?\u201d Xue Ningxiang didn\u2019t turn around, only mumbled with irritation, \u201cShameless!\u201dZhuo Fan heard her loud and clear though. [If demonic cultivators cared about reputation, what are righteous cultivators then?]A quarter of an hour later, Zhuo Fan came out of the river and put on a new robe from his ring. He patted Xue Ningxiang\u2019s shoulder, \u201cLet\u2019s go, where is the Diamond Sand going to appear?\u201dXue Ningxiang was a bit nervous seeing Zhuo Fan wanted to leave. She stood there in hesitation and was too embarrassed to speak.Zhuo Fan raised an eyebrow, \u201cWhat? Show the way. Didn\u2019t we have a deal?\u201d\u201cB-but\u2026\u201d Xue Ningxiang muttered shyly, \u201cI haven\u2019t washed yet!\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s eyebrow twitched and he exposed an enigmatic smile, \u201cI told you to wash but you refused! Since you haven\u2019t then that\u2019s that. I won\u2019t avoid you either way!\u201d\u201cB-but\u2026\u201dXue Ningxiang was even more embarrassed now. She put on a disguise to run away from home. But she was a girl, and girls loved beauty, so how could she allow herself to stay dirty?Zhuo Fan knew this too, but he was just teasing the hell out of her. [Who told her to deceive me?]Xue Ningxiang was swaying from one foot to the other but didn\u2019t speak. But when she caught Zhuo Fan\u2019s faint smile she knew he was teasing her.Pissed, she threw her hat in his face and walked to the river.But after a few steps, she turned to warn Zhuo Fan, \u201cY-you better not peek!\u201dZhuo Fan mocked as he left, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in unripe fruits!\u201dUnripe?Xue Ningxiang was startled, then looked down at her chest and pushed it out unconvinced, \u201cHumph, where am I unripe?\u201dBut Zhuo Fan had already disappeared among the trees.Xue Ningxiang pouted and returned to the river with a gloomy heart.Half an hour later, Zhuo Fan was laying carefree on a bush, holding a straw in his mouth and contemplating his next course of action. The bushes around him moved at that moment and Zhuo Fan looked over with a smile.\u201cOh, you\u2019re finally done! Little miss, can we go now?\u201d\u201cY-yeah!\u201dWith a shy reply, the bushes were pushed aside. A white-clothed delicate girl slowly walked out. She wasn\u2019t gorgeous, but she had a lively air about her.She was like a bouquet of fresh and pure flowers!Even Zhuo Fan was startled by her image. He didn\u2019t think that the dirty little beggar from before would transform into a gentle swan.Xue Ningxiang reddened a bit from his constant staring. She coughed and Zhuo Fan smiled embarrassingly.\u201cUm, lady Xue, please lead the way.\u201dChanging his mannerism after encountering a belle, Zhuo Fan started to despise himself a bit, [Since when have I become so shameless?]Yet the end result was that he found it refreshing walking side by side with a belle\u2026Two hours later, Xue Ningxiang brought him to a hilltop. Zhuo Fan was puzzled, \u201cSince the Diamond Sand is coming out, there should be plenty of people around. Why is it deserted?\u201dXue Ningxiang shook her head and rolled her eyes, \u201cBrother Zhuo, I thought you were smart. How come you are so stupid all of a sudden?\u201dZhuo Fan watched her skeptically.\u201cIf we go in right now, we will be caught. That is why I led you here!\u201dXue Ningxiang pulled Zhuo Fan\u2019s hand and went higher up the hill and pointed, \u201cThat is the place where the Diamond Sand will erupt!\u201dLooking over, Zhuo Fan saw many figures, fifty in number, defending a pond. The pond seemed to be connected to a hot spring as it was bubbling.In the centre, on a stone rising from the water, sat a grey-robed white-haired elder with his eyes closed. The air was warm around him but the steam from the hot spring vanished the closer it got to him.So much so that not even his hair was wet!\u201cSuch deep cultivation. Is he a Profound Heaven expert?\u201d Zhuo Fan frowned in panic.Suddenly, that elder snapped his eyes open and looked in Zhuo Fan\u2019s direction. His eyes were sharp and landed like lightning on his position.\u201cGet down!\u201dZhuo Fan pulled Xue Ningxiang to lie on a rock as cold sweat ran all over his body, \u201cSuch a sharp instinct, he is a Profound Heaven expert for sure!\u201d\u201cCorrect!\u201dXue Ningxiang nodded, \u201cHe is Hell Valley\u2019s elder overseeing Blue Expanse City for the past dozen years. Last month he found that the Golden Spring Pool released a lot of Diamond Sand and has stood watch here ever since. The 50 people around him are also Bone Tempering experts!\u201dZhuo Fan nodded.Before Diamond Sand erupted, it would cause the Flowing Gold Tide. But the Flowing Gold Tide would only contain trace amounts of Diamond Sand. But three months from then, the Diamond Sand would erupt for sure.[To get all the Diamond Sand before others, they placed guards. But who is to say the Diamond Sand would erupt from here?]Zhuo Fan frowned as he thought. With his power, he had no hope of stealing the Diamond Sand, unless\u2026His eyes flashed and pulled Xue Ningxiang off the hilltop.\u201cWhat, you have a way?\u201d Seeing Zhuo Fan confident, Xue Ningxiang was startled.She was already shocked that he could beat her family, but could he also have the power to win against a Profound Heaven cultivator and a team of Bone Tempering experts?Zhuo Fan shook his head, \u201cIf you can\u2019t beat them, outwit them! Let\u2019s go, I want you to find a little pet for me!\u201dXue Ningxiang was puzzled.In the Golden Spring Pool, the elder\u2019s eyes were filled with confusion, \u201cDid I sensed wrongly\u2026\u201dAt the same time, in Blue Expanse City, Xue Wanlong took Xue Lin\u2019s dirty figure home. In the main hall of the Xue clan sat a wizen old man in the seat of honor, watching the two. Then he suddenly jumped to his feet.\u201cHow was it? Did you bring Ning\u2019er? Did you deal with the culprit that harmed Gang\u2019er?\u201dSighing, Xue Wanlong shook his head, \u201cDad, I let them go! That kid is not bad, so I entrusted Ning\u2019er to him. As for him injuring Gang\u2019er, he did not know any better. As long as he takes care of Ning\u2019er, I do not mind it.\u201d\u201cWhat, that man is Ning\u2019er\u2019s\u2026\u201d The old man spouted in shock.Nodding, Xue Wanlong said, \u201cThat kid said Ning\u2019er was his. Ning\u2019er was also willing, so we can assume so!\u201d\u201cFool!\u201dThe old man slapped the table with a howl, \u201cWanlong, no matter who the kid is, even if you disregard what he did to Gang\u2019er, Ning\u2019er can never ever be taken away. You know that if she leaves, our Xue clan\u2026\u201dEven though he was angry, his eyes revealed sadness.Xue Wanlong looked at his father with firm eyes as he said, \u201cDad, let Ning\u2019er go. I will take full responsibility!\u201d\u201cYou take shit! Can you keep the young and old safe?\u201dThe old man roared, \u201cWanlong, I know you love your daughter, but you think I don\u2019t? But Xue clan\u2026\u201dSighing, the old man\u2019s face hardened, \u201cWhere did they go?\u201dXue Wanlong was vexed, but still spoke as he closed his eyes, \u201cAllbeast Mountain Range!\u201dWhoosh!In an instant, the old man vanished\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 - Mystery GuyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhuo Fan and Xue Ningxiang were searching through bushes in Allbeast Mountain Range. Xue Ningxiang was unsettled, not knowing where he was going with this.Zhuo Fan suddenly shouted in glee and held out something dirty, \u201cFound it!\u201dXue Ningxiang blinked in curiosity at the thing, \u201cWhat is it? What does it do?\u201d\u201cSweet potato!\u201dZhuo Fan gave a vague smile and continued, \u201cThe one thing that 1st level spiritual beast Burrowing Mouse likes the most!\u201dXue Ningxiang\u2019s eyes flashed and yelled, \u201cGreat plan, you want to use a Burrowing Mouse to make a tunnel and steal the Diamond Sand!\u201dThe Burrowing Mouse didn\u2019t know how to fight and even a Foundation Establishment cultivator could capture it easily. But its burrowing skill was second to none.Just one of these critters could dig through a thousand-mile long mountain range in an hour!Zhuo Fan didn\u2019t reply and showed a faint smile. Xue Ningxiang felt even more suspicious now. No one seemed to be able to unravel the insidious mind of Zhuo Fan.A moment later, Zhuo Fan took Xue Ningxiang far away from the Golden Spring Pool and made a fire in which he threw the sweet potato.Soon, a sweet aroma wafted for a hundred miles!Many spiritual beasts raised their heads and began searching for the source. Zhuo Fan took Xue Ningxiang to lay in ambush close by, their eyes fixed on the fire.The bushes rustled and many spiritual beasts, big and small, approached the fire. They prodded the black lumps in the fire, wanting to find out from where the sweet smell came from, to no avail.Zhuo Fan secretly laughed and smiled at Xue Ningxiang.In fact, the two took the cooked sweet potato long ago, they only left it inside enough to release its sweet smell and attract the Burrowing Mouse. If not, the other spiritual beasts would\u2019ve taken it away and ruined their plan.More and more spiritual beasts came and searched, but found nothing.However, the soil next to the fire moved as it bulged outwards to no more than a fist in size. Zhuo Fan stood up slowly and got ready.Suddenly, the bulge of dirt broke away. A creature with a black mouth on its tiny head came out. It roamed around the fire a few times and sniffed.[Now!]Zhuo Fan screamed in his mind as he shot for the fire. The spiritual beasts, which gathered around the fire, were only at 1st and 2nd level, ran away at the sudden noise.Only the Burrowing Mouse was oblivious to what was happening, but its intuition as a spiritual beast gave it a bit of insight that danger was looming. It immediately started moving its claw, wanting to burrow.But it was too late. Zhuo Fan already flashed before it and grabbed its tail.The Burrowing Mouse struggled for its life in panic. But there was no escape from the demonic palm of Zhuo Fan.\u201cHe-he-he, buddy, you wanna run?\u201d With a manic grin, Zhuo Fan grabbed the critter\u2019s frail body and squeezed. It screeched in pain and flailed its claws.Xue Ningxiang couldn\u2019t take it anymore and took the poor thing close to her chest. She patted it and threw Zhuo Fan an evil eye, \u201cHow can you be so cruel? What if you hurt it?\u201d\u201cHumph, spiritual beasts don\u2019t get bruised easily!\u201d Zhuo Fan snorted, \u201cWe need to hurry and tame it or we won\u2019t get another chance!\u201d\u201cBut you don\u2019t need to be such a boor about it! My clan had raised some small spiritual beasts before and even if they were wild they still listened to me!\u201dXue Ningxiang comforted the poor critter with a sweet smile, \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, little one?\u201dThe Burrowing Mouse seemed to understand and nodded, then glared at Zhuo Fan.[Curses, buddy you\u2019re pushing it here!]Zhuo Fan raged inside, itching to get his hand on the prick. But it was impossible, not with Xue Ningxiang guarding it like a tigress.But then an idea struck him and his manic grin returned.The Burrowing Mouse shivered at the sight of him and hid in Xue Ningxiang\u2019s chest.\u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d Xue Ningxiang warned Zhuo Fan as she stepped back.His face flipped to a gentle smile as a gourd appeared on his palm, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I won\u2019t harm the little one. I only want it to swallow something.\u201dThen he took out a blood-red worm from the gourd.It was the demonic creature he had raised with great care, Frigid Pool Bloodworm! Any creature that ingested it would have no choice but to listen to his commands or the Blood Curse would claim their lives.If not for time being an issue, he wouldn\u2019t have wanted to waste a Bloodworm on a 1st level spiritual beast!\u201cWhat is that? So disgusting!\u201d Xue Ningxiang frowned and took another step back. The Burrowing Mouse also sensed the danger and hid in her chest.Zhuo Fan was dead serious, \u201cWe have two ways we can tame the little guy fast. Either let me train it for a day, or he eats this.\u201dXue Ningxiang saw Zhuo Fan\u2019s face and she knew if she refused, he\u2019d use force.Helpless, Xue Ningxiang took the Burrowing Mouse out and patted its head, \u201cLittle one, it\u2019s better if you eat it. Although its a tad disgusting, it\u2019s better than landing in that guy\u2019s hands!\u201dXue Ningxiang said as she walked towards Zhuo Fan.With a sinister smile, Zhuo Fan inched the bloodworm close to the Burrowing Mouse\u2019s mouth. The critter struggled but it was of no use. The bloodworm was about to enter its mouth.At that moment, however, a whoosh was heard.Zhuo Fan pushed Xue Ningxiang away as he moved back himself, \u201cWatch out!\u201dA cold light passed between them. The freezing ray almost touched Zhuo Fan\u2019s fingers as it cut the wiggling bloodworm clean in half. He was aware of the killing intent the ray contained.Zhuo Fan turned to see a tall youth not ten meters away. He looked to be 20 years old and had a handsome visage. His eyes flashed with coldness, like a pair of sharp blades, at the two of them.The Burrowing Mouse shrieked a few times and ran from Xue Ningxiang\u2019s hands and climbed up his body to his shoulder.[It\u2026 has a master?] Zhuo Fan scowled.The youth snorted at the two, \u201cYou both got some nerve eying my spirit animal!\u201d\u201cUh, sorry, it wasn\u2019t on purpose\u2026\u201dZhuo Fan stopped Xue Ningxiang\u2019s explanation with a wave and pushed her behind him, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it has a master or not. We need it today!\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, big words!\u201dThe youth sneered, \u201cOne insect is in the 5th layer of Qi Condensation, while the other in the 4th. Yet you still want to tame what is mine? Fine, guess I will have to end you!\u201d\u201cHumph, we will see about that!\u201dSneering, Zhuo Fan rushed at the youth as Savage Moon flashed in his hand.\u201c3rd-grade demonic treasure?\u201dRaising an eyebrow, the youth lost the contempt he had before. This demonic treasure was a threat to his life, and in all his teachings he received, one needed to go all out regardless of the enemy!His eyes gleamed as he dashed at Zhuo Fan, his hand flashed and it now held a longsword.In an instant, the world seemed to freeze over. The sky and the earth seemed to vanish as flickering lights spewed from the sword!\u201cEmpty Net!\u201dWhoosh!Zhuo Fan suddenly slowed down amid his charge. Even his surroundings were sluggish while the only thing unaffected was the longsword.\u201cProfound ranked martial art, 7th layer of Bone Tempering Stage, and 4th-grade spiritual weapon!\u201dSquinting, Zhuo Fan started to take this seriously.This youth wasn\u2019t average. It was hard enough reaching such cultivation at his age, but he had also grasped a profound ranked martial art and used a 4th-grade spiritual weapon!In the Tianyu Empire, rare were those like him even in the Seven Noble Houses!And exactly that was the answer. This man could be a core disciple of the Seven Noble Houses, perhaps even an inheritor. Today Zhuo Fan offended him and tomorrow trouble would come knocking. The only choice was to kill him!In an instant, Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes exploded with killing intent.The youth was startled![Am I not the one holding the advantage? Why is this kid releasing such thick killing intent? Does he think he can actually kill me?]The next moment, however, Zhuo Fan\u2019s action left him pale.Despite knowing that he was slowed down, Zhuo Fan only took a step and turned into five images of himself!Sneering, the youth grinned, [Think you can act tough with such a base level killing move?]The youth\u2019s sword turned into five and struck each figure down. But at that moment, Zhuo Fan\u2019s voice came from behind him.\u201cNice sword skill! Too bad you met me!\u201dThe youth jumped in fright, [When did he get behind me?] In this moment of imminent danger, he stabbed backwards.The sword art\u2019s aim was perfect, targetting Zhuo Fan\u2019s chest!Zhuo Fan looked down calmly, with slight praise in his heart, [Too bad it\u2019s over!]Whoosh!Zhuo Fan ignored the sword going for his chest and slashed at the youth\u2019s waist. If this continued it would end with Zhuo Fan being gravely wounded and the youth dead![A wound for a kill, worth it\u2026]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 - Sword Marquise Abode of the Seven Noble HousesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDing!Zhuo Fan slashed with full power, but a metal screech echoed and Savage Moon bounced back.He squinted as his heart was in a panic, [This punk has a spiritual armor besides the spiritual weapon!]But the timing didn\u2019t even let him think. The youth\u2019s sword was getting dangerously close to his chest. In this wound for a kill scenario, his opponent would come unharmed while he would be too wounded to continue fighting.[Damn it, I miscalculated this time!]Zhuo Fan secretly cursed and used the Savage Moon\u2019s rebound to save himself! Not for the life of him did he think this freakin\u2019 punk to be this rich.Even an elder from Hell Valley had a single demonic treasure at best. But this punk here was wielding one while wearing another.[Who the hell is he?]Bam!With no more time to think, Zhuo Fan\u2019s Savage Moon and the golden sword struck each other.With a loud sound, Zhuo Fan flew back due to the force. The blood in his chest flowed erratically and forced him to spew blood.He hit the dirt and the Savage Moon clanked next to him in two. His brow shivered as he turned solemn.[He has a 4th-grade spiritual armor on him that my Blood Infant can\u2019t get through. The only way to hurt him was with Savage Moon.][But Savage Moon is now in pieces.]This was the first time since his rebirth that Zhuo Fan met such a danger to his life.The youth was in the 7th layer of Bone Tempering Stage, had a spiritual weapon, had a spiritual armor, and even profound ranked martial arts! [I can\u2019t punch through his defense and I can only take a beating.]But the worst part was, the youth used all his power against someone weaker. Everyone was afraid of the serious types.[This will make it even harder for him to make any mistakes for me to exploit.][How do I fight him?]Zhuo Fan stared down the figure while his forehead ran cold with sweat.Yet who\u2019d have known that the youth\u2019s mental state mirrored his, maybe even more terrified!The youth was known as a genius among geniuses in his clan. He learned the sword all his life and never lost! But against Zhuo Fan, who was weaker, he was one move away from dying even when he exerted his all.If not for the spiritual armor, he\u2019d be dead! Dead from a man weaker than him by a stage.He just couldn\u2019t get over this. He was an exceptional genius who could defeat a peak Bone Tempering expert in a single move. He was the clan\u2019s successor, how could\u2026The youth\u2019s brow was sweating bullets and gnashed his teeth at Zhuo Fan, \u201cBrother, what is your name?\u201dZhuo Fan was startled and saw the change in the youth\u2019s eyes, guessing he wouldn\u2019t keep on wanting to kill them, he replied, \u201cZhuo Fan!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll remember you. We\u2019ll finish this the next time we meet!\u201d That youth sheathed his sword, took his Burrowing Mouse, and was about to leave.Zhuo Fan rushed to say, \u201cWait!\u201dThe youth stopped, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cDare I ask brother, are you also here for the Diamond Sand?\u201dThe youth stared at Zhuo Fan, \u201cWhat if I am, what if I\u2019m not?\u201dZhuo Fan smiled, \u201cIf not, then lets part ways. If you are, want to work together?\u201d\u201cWork together?\u201d The youth frowned and took a long look at the two, \u201cHow? Not even the three of us are enough to steal one speck of Diamond Sand!\u201dNot long back, this youth viewed them as nothing more than insects, but his words just now showed his respect for Zhuo Fan\u2019s strength as someone equal to him.Zhuo Fan grinned inside. [We can negotiate like this.]\u201cBrother has a Burrowing Mouse, so you plan to avoid fighting them.\u201dThe youth smiled, \u201cSo we had the same idea. I see why you wanted this guy! But this Burrowing Mouse is mine. What can you bring if we team up?\u201d\u201cThe correct way of using the Burrowing Mouse!\u201dZhuo Fan continued with a smile, \u201cHow is brother going to use it to get the Diamond Sand?\u201dThe youth squinted, and replied with another question, \u201cHow about you?\u201d\u201cDig a tunnel, wait for the Diamond Sand to erupt, and we steal some.\u201d Xue Ningxiang spoke out of turn.But her response only earned the laughter of the two until her face went red. She glared, \u201cWhy are you laughing? Am I wrong?\u201dThe youth shook his head, \u201cLady, they have a Profound Heaven expert, so how could it work? You\u2019ll be caught before you even make a move!\u201dZhuo Fan nodded, \u201cIn any case, my silly sister raised an option we definitely must avoid. What about you?\u201dXue Ningxiang glared at Zhuo Fan for making fun of her, but her face became red again for some other reason.The youth spoke simply, \u201cEasy, the Diamond Sand is pushed by the deep earth and comes out as a spring. I will have the Burrowing Mouse dig a small tunnel from the main course to direct a part of the Diamond Sand to me.\u201dZhuo Fan clapped and Xue Ningxiang praised the brilliance of it, \u201cGreat plan.\u201dThe youth smiled with pride, but Zhuo Fan shook his head, \u201cIf I were you, this would also be the best plan.\u201dThe youth frowned, \u201cYou have a better way then?\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, of course. Why would I work with you if I didn\u2019t?\u201dZhuo Fan smiled as he continued, \u201cYour plan won\u2019t earn you even a thousandth. Since there are so many types of earth layers beneath us, the Diamond Sand will be stuck along the way and you will get even less!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your idea then?\u201d The youth stared at him.With a mysterious smile, Zhuo Fan stuck out his chin, \u201cIf brother believes me, I can get all of it, leaving nothing to Hell Valley. We will later split it evenly. What do you say?\u201d\u201cHow can that be?\u201dThe youth watched them in shock, but Zhuo Fan was confident, \u201cMy skill is making impossible possible.\u201dThis got the youth to recall Zhuo Fan\u2019s close call in killing him and nodded, \u201cFine, I believe you! How do we do it?\u201d\u201cSplendid!\u201d Zhuo Fan laughed, \u201cWe are now partners. How should I address brother?\u201d\u201cXie Tianyang!\u201d The youth spoke loud and clear.Zhuo Fan frowned, \u201cXie\u2026 you mean you\u2019re from the Seven Noble Houses, Sword Marquise Abode\u2026\u201dWaving his hand, Xie Tianyang smiled vaguely. But they all figured out even if Zhuo Fan didn\u2019t get to finish. Xue Ningxiang watched the youth for a long time in shock.Second rate clans like the Xue clan relied on the protection of the Seven Noble Houses. Just that she never got to leave Blue Expanse City, not once in her life, and the only Seven Noble Houses\u2019 people she saw were from Hell Valley.\u201cOh, brother Zhuo, what house do you come from that you\u2019re so amazing?\u201d Xue Ningxiang couldn\u2019t help but wonder as Zhuo Fan was so young and yet no less powerful than Xie Tianyang.In fact, Zhuo Fan could\u2019ve struck this disciple of Sword Marquise Abode dead if not for the spiritual armor. Thus, Zhuo Fan had to be from a special background.Xie Tianyang also turned to Zhuo Fan with eager eyes. He wanted to know just which house gave birth to such a monster.Zhuo Fan shook his head with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m no one important, just a small steward in the Luo clan of Windgaze City!\u201dSteward? Luo clan?The two were shocked.[Luo clan? Never heard of it!]\u201cHa-ha-ha, it\u2019s quite normal for you to not know. Luo clan is just a 3rd rate clan!\u201d Zhuo Fan smiled.This time, both of them eyed him with suspicion.They would never believe that a trifling clan could raise such an expert! Not even the Imperial family and the seven houses had many like him.\u201cBrother, if what you said is true, you are welcome to join Sword Marquise Abode!\u201d Xie Tianyang\u2019s eyes shined as he patted Zhuo Fan\u2019s shoulder.It mattered little if Zhuo Fan was being honest, he was an unpolished gem nonetheless. With Zhuo Fan joining the Sword Marquise Abode, the Luo clan would one day be a 2nd rate clan, maybe even a peak second rate with the house\u2019s assistance. The Sword Marquise Abode would at that time grow in power even more.For one of the Seven Noble Houses to personally ask for a clan to sign an agreement with them would stir all other small clans into crying if they found out. But Zhuo Fan only disdained this act.Knowing where Xie Tianyang was going with this, Zhuo Fan smiled, \u201cHe-he-he, you\u2019re late. I already signed an alliance agreement with Veiled Dragon Pavilion! But if Sword Marquise Abode wants to sign a similar agreement, I\u2019d be happy to oblige!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dZhuo Fan just dropped a bomb that shocked the other two to their cores!Alliance agreement? Veiled Dragon Pavilion?Why would Veiled Dragon Pavilion do this for a small clan\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 - Thousand Mile-long ArrayPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayXue Ningxiang and Xie Tianyang took long skeptical looks at Zhuo Fan.From Zhuo Fan\u2019s reaction, it could be said he spoke the truth. But this news was too outrageous, even worse than if the heaven and earth switched places.The Seven Noble Houses could stand shoulder to shoulder with the Imperial family. If they discovered a clan with great potential, signing a vassal agreement was more appropriate.But an alliance agreement only ever happened between the Seven Noble Houses.Yet this gap in power between the house and the clan breached by an alliance agreement made it look like the Emperor went out to a beggar and called him brother.Such an act would make them, the seven houses and the Emperor, look like charitable folks. But this was fundamentally impossible. Just how did Zhuo Fan do it?Xie Tianyang watched Zhuo Fan closely but shook his head in the end, \u201cBrother, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want to say it. But do you have to lie to us so openly?\u201dXue Ningxiang rolled her eyes while whining, \u201cBrother Zhuo, we told you everything about us, while you still keep your\u2019s secret. This is not proper!\u201dZhuo Fan shook his head. The truth was taken as lies by others and he did not know how to respond.\u201cAlright, brother Zhuo, let\u2019s forget it. We\u2019ll be going our separate ways when this is over anyway, with little chance of meeting again. There\u2019s no need to know everything about each other.\u201dThen, Xie Tianyang clapped, \u201cWe had better listen to brother Zhuo\u2019s plan.\u201dZhuo Fan nodded with a smile.He liked Xie Tianyang\u2019s attitude a lot. There was no eternal enemies and friends in the world, only benefits. They were friends now, thanks to a mutual goal, but tomorrow they might be on opposite sides. There was no need to know too much about each other.Quite the contrary, it would be best to hide one\u2019s secret and protect one\u2019s identity.Only Xue Ningxiang pouted, \u201cSince we were brought together by fate, why can\u2019t we be friends?\u201dZhuo Fan and Xie Tianyang just smiled.Zhuo Fan then retrieved a piece of paper from his ring and began to write on it. Fifteen minutes later, a strange design adorned it.Xue Ningxiang was looking puzzled, while Xie Tianyang was feeling more and more astonished with each brushwork.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dXie Tianyang watched the finished design in shock, \u201cA 1st-grade array?\u201d\u201cB-but I\u2019ve never seen this one in my life, and I\u2019ve seen my fair share\u2026\u201dZhuo Fan secretly nodded. Xie Tianyang was from the seven houses, and just like Long Kui, he had learned of arrays from a young age. But few parts of this array were from an ancient era and not seen today. Thus, he could not understand the array completely.Xie Tianyang studied the design for a long time, then looked at Zhuo Fan with a firm gaze, \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2019re from the seven houses, no, maybe even Imperial\u2026\u201dHe wasn\u2019t certain, because the more he got to know Zhuo Fan, the more Zhuo Fan\u2019s talent scared him. So much that he couldn\u2019t ascertain which house Zhuo Fan belonged to.He even felt the seven houses couldn\u2019t have raised such a monstrous talent. Then the only one above the houses was the Imperial family\u2026Zhuo Fan shook his head, \u201cI already said it. It\u2019s up to you to believe or not, but now we\u2019re working together.\u201dXie Tianyang gave a strained nod.\u201cFollow me!\u201dZhuo Fan took out a map and walked ahead with the other two close behind.After half a day, Zhuo Fan reached a stream. He gave the area a once-over and nodded. Xue Ningxiang and Xie Tianyang were filled with curiosity.This place was even farther away from the Golden Spring Pool, and near the border to the second area in the Allbeast Mountain Range.Allbeast Mountain Range was split into three areas based on how dangerous the spiritual beasts were.The first area was the safest, with only 1st and 2nd level spiritual beasts roaming around, and the seldom 3rd level. These were suited for Foundation Establishment and Qi Condensation cultivators to catch as spirit animals.And the Golden Spring Pool was in this area.The second area was the treasure hunting area, a place where 3rd and 4th level spiritual beasts came and went as they pleased. Entering it while being below the Bone Tempering Stage equaled death.But this area was filled with spiritual beasts, an important place from where strong experts got their spirit animals.The third area was deemed as the danger zone. The spiritual beasts here were of 5th and 6th level. Even a Radiant Stage expert would die here.As such, if one didn\u2019t have absolute confidence in his power, he would not step foot here.Zhuo Fan was now standing near the border between the first and second areas. Once they entered the second area, Xue Ningxiang, with her Qi Condensation cultivation, would find death lurking at every corner.Zhuo Fan took a deep breath and nodded, \u201cThis is it!\u201dXue Ningxiang and Xie Tianyang were puzzled, but Zhuo Fan waved, \u201cBrother Tianyang, I\u2019ll be counting on your Burrowing Mouse to dig a tunnel to the Golden Spring Pool, then keep digging along this pattern.\u201dZhuo Fan pointed on the map, \u201cThis is where the Golden Spring Pool is!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Xie Tianyang said startled, \u201cFor it to dig to the Golden Spring Pool is not a problem, but for it to arrange spirit stones and set an array\u2026 It will take more than a thousand trips!\u201d\u201cCorrect, 3221 to be exact!\u201d Zhuo Fan nodded, \u201cBurrowing mouse is small and can only carry one spirit stone at a time. This means it will take 3221 trips to set the array around the Golden Spring Pool.\u201dXie Tianyang gasped and Xue Ningxiang went slack-jawed, \u201cYou want to work it to death!\u201dEven the Burrowing Mouse seemed to understand and collapsed on Xie Tianyang\u2019s shoulder.[Shit, this punk is after my life. I can\u2019t do this idiotic thing or it\u2019ll be the death of me!]Burrowing Mouse shut its eyes. Even when it fell from the shoulder and landed on a rock it wouldn\u2019t open them, though its twitching gave it away.Zhuo Fan smirked and ignored the critter while talking to its owner, \u201cTime is of the essence. Diamond Sand could erupt at any minute, so get your critter step on it.\u201d\u201cIs there no other way?\u201d Xie Tianyang asked with a solemn expression.Zhuo Fan smiled, \u201cIf you can snatch the Diamond Sand from right under their noses then be my guest!\u201dXie Tianyang watched the unmoving critter on the ground with pity.Zhuo Fan added an incentive, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more Burrowing Mouse where he comes from, but as for Diamond Sand\u2026 He-he-he, only if you listen to me will you make a killing!\u201dSpurred on, Xie Tianyang\u2019s eyes flashed and he nodded, \u201cFine, it\u2019s just a 1st level spirit animal anyway. Who would need it, ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201dThe Burrowing Mouse jumped to its feet and pleaded to its owner with teary eyes.[Master, how can you be so cruel! I\u2019ll end up working to the bone!]But Xie Tianyang was too far gone to notice its gesture, as he and Zhuo Fan looked like demons with their manic grins at the poor critter.Xue Ningxiang watched the cuddly and pitiful little one and her heart swelled with love. She hugged it and comforted it as she glared at the two demons.But why would any of them care about a critter when Diamond Sand was at stake?At once, under the stately figure of its master, Xie Tianyang, the Burrowing Mouse was compelled to dig to Golden Spring Pool. In fifteen minutes, a new pattern was beginning to emerge underneath the Golden Spring Pool, all according to Zhuo Fan\u2019s grand design.Yet the elder stationed at the Golden Spring Pool was oblivious to everything that was happening right underneath his nose.This was only the beginning for the oppressed Burrowing Mouse, which was forced to work itself into the ground. The only time the trio saw it was when it came for the next spirit stone. It could take it at first, but once it was finished with its first hundred stones, it was dog-tired that even its fur was slick with sweat.Around the 500th trip, the critter was gasping.Xue Ningxiang\u2019s heart was bleeding, wanting to give the poor guy a rest. But Zhuo Fan and Xie Tianyang stood like demons, just like a landlord overlooking his peasants, making sure to leave them dead tired.Especially Xie Tianyang, having nothing but Diamond Sand in his head, he had no time to mind trifles like getting his spirit animal killed from overworking.This resulted with the Burrowing Mouse making trip after trip and Xue Ningxiang giving it a sip of water on the sly out of pity, the only thing that she could do to ease its hell.In the eyes of the little guy, she became a goddess.It was starting to hate itself for choosing poorly. Its owner just heard demon king Zhuo Fan\u2019s two cents and was hooked into sending it to its death!When it came out for the final time, it was close to breathing its last. Xue Ningxiang hugged it and consoled it, letting it feel the joy of a survivor.Zhuo Fan smiled at Xie Tianyang, \u201cSee, I told you it\u2019d be fine!\u201dXie Tianyang sighed, \u201cYeah, but this guy would hate me to the bone after this.\u201d\u201cNo choice. If we wanted to have the array in place within three days, the only choice was its sacrifice.\u201d Zhuo Fan shrugged, \u201cIf he\u2019d really died of work, then it wouldn\u2019t be treated as a 1st level spiritual beast.\u201dZhuo Fan stood up and his hand flashed as he deployed another array on the stream\u2019s bank. With a hand sign, the spirit stones in the ground lit up.An invisible ripple spread out and the two arrays, thousands of miles from each other, were now connected.At almost the same time, the elder at the Golden Spring Pool shivered and opened his eyes with suspicion, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why am I restless all of a sudden?\u201dNext to the stream, Zhuo Fan revealed a wicked grin, \u201cOnly one more push! When the Diamond Sand erupts, Hell Valley\u2019s elder would get the shock of his life, he-he-he\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 - Heaven and Earth ShiftPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWith everything in place, Zhuo Fan\u2019s party entered an idle period alongside Hell Valley\u2019s elder, waiting for the eruption of Diamond Sand.For a while, everything was quiet and peaceful. Xie Tianyang was feeling bored standing guard every day and thought of training his martial arts, but his worries about the Diamond Sand erupting and Zhuo Fan hogging it won over that feeling in the end.Because he knew Zhuo Fan\u2019s mannerism but not his intention, and because he didn\u2019t understand Zhuo Fan either, he held some mistrust.While Xue Ningxiang seemed to have forgotten about the Diamond Sand and played with the Burrowing Mouse every day. Xie Tianyang tried to call the critter over, but the little guy gave him an eye roll, which only worked to embarrass him.It was his spirit animal yet it was closer with Xue Ningxiang\u2026So he switched targets to Zhuo Fan, watching him with a perplexed look.Zhuo Fan was a riddle, be it his background or his origins. In no way would he believe Zhuo Fan\u2019s words of coming from a small clan.Among their group, Zhuo Fan was the calmest. Over the past ten-so days all he did was meditate. As if he didn\u2019t care about the Diamond Sand at all, while in fact it also concerned him the most.Zhuo Fan, in Xie Tianyang\u2019s mind, was becoming more valued, with how rare such a character existed in the Tianyu Empire.At least he didn\u2019t have the state of mind to cultivate while waiting for the Diamond Sand like Zhuo Fan.Cultivating with his anxiety and restlessness would only cause a deviation. While Zhuo Fan\u2026Xie Tianyang scrutinized Zhuo Fan, feeling envy.A sudden sound woke Zhuo Fan up, \u201cAt last, the 6th layer of Qi Condensation.\u201dXie Tianyang\u2019s cheek trembled and showed a resigned expression.To breakthrough at such a crucial time, he would never reach Zhuo Fan\u2019s state of mind for years to come\u2026This was how the trio spent the next month. Xie Tianyang was bored out of his mind, Xue Ningxiang and the critter played like crazy, sporting smiles every moment, while Zhuo Fan sat there in meditation.Rolling his eyes, Xie Tianyang was driven to the point of insanity. [If I knew this would happen, I wouldn\u2019t have pushed the Burrowing Mouse that hard.]The critter broke up with him so thoroughly that it wouldn\u2019t even come to relieve his boredom!\u201cCan\u2019t take it anymore!\u201d Xie Tianyang wailed.Then a sudden bang resounded across the mountain range and the ground started shaking.\u201cIt\u2019s time!\u201dZhuo Fan jumped to his feet. Xue Ningxiang, who was playing with the critter, was a bit startled and turned to Zhuo Fan and Xie Tianyang.But the two didn\u2019t look afraid, only excited!Hell Valley\u2019s 7th elder stationed at Golden Spring Pool flew higher, \u201cHa-ha-ha, I have waited two months for this.\u201d\u201cMen, cast the nets to gather the Diamond Sand!\u201d The 7th elder roared and the Bone Tempering guards bowed, \u201cUnderstood!\u201dThey then began throwing golden nets into the Golden Spring Pool until it was all shining golden.At the same time, at the stream, Zhuo Fan asked, \u201cDid you prepare a net?\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, why would I come for Diamond Sand if I hadn\u2019t?\u201d Xie Tianyang laughed and cast his net.Diamond Sand erupted along with lava and it needed special nets to filter it.Zhuo Fan also cast his own golden net into the stream.Xie Tianyang watched him doubtful, \u201cBrother Zhuo, what will you do now?\u201d\u201cWatch closely!\u201dZhuo Fan smiled with confidence and his hand performed signs, \u201cHeaven and Earth reverse, mountains and river switch, yin and yang shift, twin array exchange!\u201dThe spirit stones laid underground shined ever brighter and each beam of light pierced the horizon.All around the Golden Spring Pool, 3221 light pillars towered towards the sky. The 7th elder felt uneasy, but as Diamond Sand\u2019s eruption was imminent, he had no time to mind parlor tricks and fixed his eyes on the hot spring\u2019s mouth.Suddenly, a column of water sprouted from the spring, just that the heat from it was far lower.People were stunned seeing this.Reason dictated that along with the eruption of Diamond Sand, lava should flow out too. The hot spring\u2019s water would be so hot that not even a Bone Tempering expert should be able to approach.But why was there only plain water?7th elder blinked in a daze, then face-palmed, \u201cDamn it, someone\u2019s playing us.\u201dHe rushed higher in the air and saw thousands of light pillars in the distance.\u201cThere!\u201d7th elder seethed in rage as he charged, \u201cYou\u2019re dead if you think you can play me!\u201dMeanwhile, the stream before Zhuo Fan\u2019s party was gone, replaced by a dark hole that was soon spewing lava along with fine and shiny particles.\u201cDiamond Sand!\u201d Xie Tianyang was overjoyed as he turned to Zhuo Fan in shock, \u201cBrother Zhuo, you\u2019re great. How is the Diamond Sand erupting here?\u201dGrinning, Zhuo Fan flatly said, \u201cThis array is called Heaven and Earth Shift. It is a mere 1st-grade array, but it can reverse yin and yang, shift mountains and rivers. I only switched Diamond Sand\u2019s flow to here.\u201dZhuo Fan said it dully, but Xie Tianyang was shocked to the core.As far as he knew, only 6th grade and above arrays could do that, and they were all lost. But Zhuo Fan not only did it but used just a 1st-grade array in the process.He started to recall Zhuo Fan mentioning Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s alliance agreement.[It might not be far fetched for Veiled Dragon Pavilion to make such an agreement if they knew of brother Zhuo\u2019s outrageous talent.]Xie Tianyang watched Zhuo Fan closely with a secret smile. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d meet such a man when he decided to get the Diamond Sand.[There may not be a second person in the empire who can set this array.]Xie Tianyang then spoke, \u201cBrother Zhuo, would you like to come into Sword Marquise Abode as a Venerable?\u201dXue Ningxiang was tongue-tied. Zhuo Fan was so young yet he\u2019d get to be a Venerable in one of the seven houses!Zhuo Fan rolled his eyes and almost made Xue Ningxiang stumble with his next words, \u201cSave it. Veiled Dragon Pavilion tried it already and I refused them all the same. That\u2019s why they changed to having an alliance agreement!\u201d\u201cBrother Zhuo, you\u2019re showing off here.\u201d Xue Ningxiang clearly doubted his words.But Xie Tianyang nodded and said, \u201cAlright, I will send someone with an alliance agreement when I get back. Where do I send it?\u201d\u201cWindgaze City\u2019s Luo clan. I will return when I am finished with my affairs!\u201dXie Tianyang hesitated, \u201cThen I will wait for your return. I want to sign it with you. With your skills, when you leave the Luo clan in the future, we won\u2019t lose out then!\u201dZhuo Fan shook his head, [Why are all seven houses the same?]Xue Ningxiang gasped as her face twitched. [Sword Marquise Abode is so unruly, why would they want to sign an agreement with an outsider?]And it wasn\u2019t with a clan, but with a single man!But what escaped her thoughts was that precisely because Xie Tianyang was from the seven houses that he valued Zhuo Fan so much. The average clan would never see Zhuo Fan\u2019s value.At this time, the dark cave let out a final eruption of lava. Seeing this, Zhuo Fan urged, \u201cGet the nets!\u201d\u201cWhy the hurry?\u201dXie Tianyang waved and continued with a smile, \u201cThe nets are made of spirit metal. They won\u2019t break in lava.\u201dZhuo Fan snorted, \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that? If we don\u2019t go now, we may not have a life to enjoy it.\u201dXie Tianyang was startled as Zhuo Fan continued, \u201cYou think all elders from Hell Valley are blind? Who wouldn\u2019t notice the light pillars? Just wait, and you will have a Profound Heaven expert hovering overhead!\u201dXie Tianyang rushed in with his hand signs to recover the net. As the nets rose, the trio saw the glitters among the lava. And on the net\u2019s threads was shining sand.\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201dXie Tianyang was happy seeing the net but was aware of the imminent danger. Zhuo Fan dragged them for 12 hours to this place for a reason most obvious\u2013to buy time. Even a Profound Heaven expert would need two hours to reach here.During this time, they could retrieve the Diamond Sand and leave. But where to run was the question? Where was safe?Noticing Zhuo Fan gazing at the stream\u2019s opposite bank, the pair shouted, \u201cThe second area?\u201d\u201cWrong!\u201d Zhuo Fan said dryly, \u201cThe third area!\u201dGasping, the two stared at Zhuo Fan in a daze.[Is this guy crazy? The second area is dangerous enough, but going to the third is suicide!]But they both were oblivious to the fact that Zhuo Fan\u2019s aim from the start was in that area.6th level spiritual beast, Thunder Skylark\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 - ChasePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWe\u2019ll divide the Diamond Sand first then flee!\u201dZhuo Fan was getting eager to get his share of the spoils when he saw the glittering dust and gave the two the cold shoulder.Xue Ningxiang and Xie Tianyang smiled bitterly.Ever since they ran into Zhuo Fan, they were led by the nose. Zhuo Fan did whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted.The same went for abusing the critter and setting an array to steal all Diamond Sand.But all turned out fine in the end, everything he did was flawless and brought success. So, despite Zhuo Fan making no sense, which added to their worry, the two believed he had a failsafe in place.So Xie Tianyang dropped the issue and was excited by all the glittering dust before him.Whoosh!The dust flowed like water out of the net and filled a one-meter tall bucket; and that was just a third.So everyone started taking out any containers they had from their rings, and the coveted Diamond Sand soon filled vessels of all shapes and sizes.Seeing such a haul, Xie Tianyang was smiling in excitement.At first, he hoped to use the Burrowing Mouse to get a bit of Diamond Sand, and now, with a weirdo like Zhuo Fan around, they got everything in no time at all.In refining a 5th-grade spiritual weapon, a handful of Diamond Sand was enough to raise its power, making it a top 5th-grade spiritual weapon. But with heaps of Diamond Sand, who knew how many such weapons could be made, and he could even add as much dust as he wanted in the refining process.When refining, people would add a gram, fuse it well, then add another gram; thereby increasing the amount of Diamond Sand progressively.[With this much yield, it\u2019s even possible to make a pure Diamond Sand spiritual weapon, ha-ha-ha\u2026]Xie Tianyang started laughing. Despite his high position in Sword Marquise Abode and not being poor in the least, compared to the Diamond Sand before him, it was no different than being a beggar\u2026Zhuo Fan saw Xie Tianyang laugh, his eyes flashed as he turned back to the glittering sand with a smirk.[Sword Marquise Abodes\u2019s disciples are ignorant of the world outside!]Zhuo Fan then stashed half of the sand into his ring while he spoke in a flat tone, \u201cThis is my share and the rest is yours!\u201dXie Tianyang blinked, then smiled, \u201cNo worries, it\u2019s fine if you take a bit more!\u201dThey had struck it rich this time. So, even with Zhuo Fan taking half, it was more than enough for the other two.But in the end, this wealth was divided in two, with Xue Ningxiang having no interest in it. Compared to having such a precious item, she\u2019d rather get out of Blue Expanse City.Zhuo Fan only took his share, leaving her\u2019s untouched. Xie Tianyang secretly nodded and took the rest of the Diamond Sand, and asked Zhuo Fan, \u201cHow do we escape now?\u201dWhoosh!Zhuo Fan\u2019s hand held a small bottle and took three red pills out. He ate one and gave the rest to the two.\u201cThis is a 1st-grade pill, Energy Concealing Pill. It can hide our auras for a whole day and let us pass through the second area while not attracting spiritual beasts.\u201dXie Tianyang looked at the pill with amazement, \u201cThat\u2019s great! Where did you get it?\u201dAllbeast Mountain Range was a treasure trove that had the continent\u2019s cultivators drooling over for thousands of years. Too bad the spiritual beasts were a bit savage and kept the cultivators at bay. If they knew such a pill existed, they\u2019d be fighting over it. Moreover, it was just a 1st-grade pill!As far as Xie Tianyang knew, the continent didn\u2019t have such a pill, or wouldn\u2019t the cultivators be flocking here by now?Xue Ningxiang was also amazed.Zhuo Fan scratched his nose, \u201cI made it, it is unique to me!\u201dXie Tianyang shouted, \u201cYou\u2019re a freakin\u2019 alchemist too?\u201dPerhaps he was a bit too amazing that Xie Tianyang even had to resort to curses. But Zhuo Fan couldn\u2019t care less, which was evident from his shrug, \u201cYep, the more skills the better!\u201dThe shock got to Xie Tianyang so badly that his cheek was twitching.[Who the hell is this punk? He\u2019s a Qi Condensation cultivator, yet can match me, a Bone Tempering cultivator. And now he\u2019s an alchemist too?][Not only that, but he also sets up a lost array and refines unprecedented pills!]Until now he thought that he had met a paragon like himself, just another strong opponent like the few geniuses he found his match in, in the seven houses.But with Zhuo Fan revealing that he was also an alchemist, gave Xie Tianyang\u2019s psyche a heavy blow. Next time around, he\u2019d never say that he was a genius, at least not when Zhuo Fan was present!Xie Tianyang swallowed the pill and jumped across the stream and into the second area, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dZhuo Fan and Xue Ningxiang were startled, [What\u2019s up with him?]They didn\u2019t know that this proud and conceited genius had just fallen from cloud nine all the way down into the mortal quagmire.Two hours later, a gray figure landed next to the stream. It was the seventh elder.His face was red with rage when he saw the steaming lava, and his hawk-eyes flashed with killing intent.\u201cSomeone\u2026 someone pulled the Diamond Sand here\u2026\u201dSquinting, the seventh elder huffed a few times then calmed down. But the coldness on his face grew thicker.He looked around and muttered, \u201cThey just got the Diamond Sand and shouldn\u2019t have run far. If they stayed in the first area, death was only a matter of time. Then\u2026\u201dThe seventh elder turned to the opposite bank with a sneer, \u201cThink you can get rid of me with parlor tricks?\u201dThen he soared into the second area!A hundred miles out, Zhuo Fan\u2019s party was running when a sudden cawing came from behind followed by crows taking to the sky.Zhuo Fan stopped and looked back with a frown.\u201cWhat?\u201d Xie Tianyang and Xue Ningxiang also stopped.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Zhuo Fan muttered, \u201cThat elder is charging right into the second area!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Xie Tianyang was anxious, \u201cWhat now? He will catch up in no time.\u201dZhuo Fan sighed, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I thought that the elder would first search the first area after inspecting the lava, just to be sure. Thus, buying us enough time. Moreover, the second area is notoriously dangerous, so I guessed he wouldn\u2019t come here to search so soon. That is why I picked this area to flee.\u201d\u201cAnd by the time he\u2019d figure it out, we\u2019d have a six-hour lead. And for his safety in the second area, he\u2019d be flying far slower to avoid 4th level spiritual beasts. At that point, we\u2019d be in the third area and he\u2019d ultimately given up the chase. In that area, he will be in the same boat as us, food for the spiritual beasts. So he\u2019d never go in after us.\u201dZhuo Fan squinted, \u201cYet he went for the second area from the start. In this case, we only have one hour lead. If he catches up to us here, we\u2019re dead!\u201d\u201cBrother Zhuo, haven\u2019t you heard of the seventh elder and what he is famous for?\u201d Xie Tianyang asked.Zhuo Fan was startled, \u201cI only knew that a Hell Valley\u2019s elder was stationed here, but not the details.\u201dSighing, Xie Tianyang shook his head, \u201cKnow your enemy and yourself and you shall win a hundred battles. It\u2019s normal for you to make a mistake when you don\u2019t even know how dreadful the seventh elder is.\u201d\u201cDreadful?\u201d Zhuo Fan frowned.Xie Tianyang said in a severe tone, \u201cHe is greatly admired in Hell Valley, and even Valley Lord You Wanshan consults with him. Or he wouldn\u2019t have left such an important city in the seventh elder\u2019s charge.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying he\u2019s strong?\u201d Zhuo Fan\u2019s brow twitched.Xie Tianyang shook his head, \u201cNot his strength, but his schemes! He is cunning and deceitful, known as the Insidious Demon. His mind is filled with schemes. Many elders of the seven houses have fallen in his ploys. Even Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s Elder Jiu lost his Purple Lightning Gold Eye because of the seventh elder\u2019s plot.\u201d\u201cMany hate him to the bone, but even more fear him!\u201dNo wonder Zhuo Fan\u2019s plan fell through. [He is another who plays open schemes. This kind of plot is useless against him.]But the die was cast and Zhuo Fan\u2019s only choice was to beat him at his own game!\u201cBrother Zhuo, our only choice is to leave lady Ning\u2019er behind. With our speed, we may be able to escape the seventh elder\u2019s clutches.\u201d Xie Tianyang\u2019s eyes flashed as he spoke firmly.Xue Ningxiang shuddered and grabbed Zhuo Fan\u2019s arm with a pitiful look, \u201cBrother Zhuo, you promised to get me out.\u201d\u201cBrother Zhuo, this is not the time to be soft. Leave her behind. She will stall the seventh elder while we escape!\u201dXie Tianyang\u2019s mind was set.Zhuo Fan squinted as he contemplated, then sneered at Xie Tianyang, \u201cHumph, if not for my Energy Concealing Pill, you\u2019d have thrown me away too.\u201dXie Tianyang\u2019s mouth pursed.Zhuo Fan laughed it off and said, \u201cI won\u2019t abandon anyone. As for that elder, I have my way to deal with him. I will fight him right here, with an array!\u201dXie Tianyang nodded after a careful ponder. He knew of Zhuo Fan\u2019s skills in arrays and was certain that Zhuo Fan was an array grandmaster.Xue Ningxiang was beaming as she heard him and was swinging Zhuo Fan\u2019s arm on and on with a red tint on her cheeks.But they both failed to notice Zhuo Fan\u2019s odd smile at the end\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 - Thunderflame Gale ArrayPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhoosh!Beneath the shade of the forest, a gray figure flitted by. The moment a spiritual beast saw him, it would jump on him with greedy eyes.But the beast would ultimately fall to the ground lifeless with an extra fist imprint on its chest.The seventh elder\u2019s eyes turned darker, but his speed remained the same. Unlike Zhuo Fan, his flight attracted no little amount of trouble.Yet this only left a trail of 3rd level spiritual beasts corpses behind. He was lucky enough that he did not meet a 4th level spiritual beast, or it would have been a slightly different outcome.Whoosh!Suddenly, he landed in an open area. He checked for tracks, making sure nothing escaped his sight.\u201cHe-he-he, three little brats. Want to run?\u201d The seventh elder sneered. He stood upright and scrutinized his surroundings with a cold eye, \u201cWill you come out yourselves, or shall I drag you out?\u201dHis yell bathed the trees in killing intent and scared off nearby spiritual beasts.\u201cHa-ha-ha, I see the seventh elder is not without his reputation. No wonder you are called Insidious Demon, finding how many we are just from a few faint signs. I am in awe!\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s laughter resounded through the air. The seventh elder frowned and paid closer attention, \u201cKid, you have just entered the 6th layer of Qi Condensation.\u201d\u201cGood ears!\u201dThe hidden Zhuo Fan felt his heart go cold. This elder was shrewder then he\u2019d thought, a hard opponent, but he still kept his cool.\u201cSeventh elder must be tired after such a long chase. And fighting here will attract 4th level spiritual beasts. It will be quite an annoyance to you. What if we strike a deal?\u201d\u201cWhich is?\u201d The seventh elder snorted and his cold eyes flitted around the area.Zhuo Fan smiled, \u201cSeventh elder chased us for so long all for the Diamond Sand. If we give you half, are you willing to let us go?\u201d\u201cYou must be joking. The Diamond Sand was mine to begin with. You want to bargain with what you stole from me?\u201d The seventh elder laughed while being shrouded in thick killing intent, \u201cI will not only get my Diamond Sand but wring the life out of you brats!\u201dThen the elder rushed towards a lush tree. He struck it with his palm and made it explode, to reveal Zhuo Fan sitting on the rock behind it.\u201cHe-he-he, brat, you knew of my sharp hearing yet still talked about conditions with me!\u201dThe seventh elder went for another palm attack, this time targetting Zhuo Fan. But the latter was calm as ever, he even smiled, \u201cHe-he-he, I\u2019ve never been afraid of revealing myself from the start!\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s hand shifted and\u2026Boom!With a loud noise, from behind Zhuo Fan, a towering flame rose 50 meters high. And with a bird cry, it took the shape of a phoenix.It spread its wings and launched two fire pillars at seventh elder!\u201cArray?\u201dThe elder was startled as he didn\u2019t foresee the weak brat would know about arrays. From the look of its power, it had to be in 5th-grade.No longer careless, he struck the pillars with his palms.Boom!Raging flames exploded and the elder was thrown back with burned palms.Looking up, the elder\u2019s carefree eyes from before, sported a hint of severity now.\u201cI took you lightly.\u201d The seventh elder squinted, \u201cNever imagining a 6th layer of Qi Condensation youth was a 5th-grade array master. Too bad it won\u2019t be enough to beat me!\u201dThe seventh elder soared and made a sign.A fiendish demonic shadow rose behind him from the twisting black tendrils of energy. Wails echoed around him and made the temperature drop.Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes squinted and his tone lowered, \u201cSuch a malevolent demonic method, is this from Hell Valley\u2019s inheritance?\u201d\u201cHe-he-he, why do the dead need to know so much?\u201dThe seventh elder cackled and pointed. The demonic shadow rushed at Zhuo Fan with a shriek. Zhuo Fan responded with a hand sign.The fire phoenix cried and spat flames.Bam!Flames and shadow collided in an anticlimactic way. When the fire touched the demon, hissing was heard as if it was met with ice.The seventh elder looked proud of this while Zhuo Fan squinted, \u201cNing\u2019er, now!\u201dA faint cry echoed and from another side not far from Zhuo Fan, a fierce gale hammered through the woods and exposed Xue Ningxiang sitting on a stone.At Zhuo Fan\u2019s call, she made the hand signs he had taught her.A chilling wind picked up and flew like a blade as it fused into the fire phoenix\u2019s attack.The fire pillar expanded ten times in a blink and started pushing back the demonic shadow.The seventh elder\u2019s face turned grave and made hand signs to strengthen the demonic shadow.But with the help of Xue Ningxiang, Zhuo Fan was getting the upper hand and the seventh elder started sweating.He never saw it coming. Another person was controlling the array!But before he could think of a countermeasure, Zhuo Fan shouted again.\u201cXie Tianyang, he\u2019s yours!\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, I was waiting for this! See how I splatter the brains of a Profound Heaven expert!\u201dUnder Xie Tianyang\u2019s incessant cackling, lightning burst and revealed him sitting on the other side of Zhuo Fan and across from Xue Ningxiang.Xie Tianyang made a hand sign and launched a 50-meter long lightning dragon. With a roar, it flashed right into the demonic shadow.Boom!As lightning entered the shadow, it triggered an explosion!The demonic shadow could not overcome the multiple increases in power and was blown into black pieces, soon becoming nothing but ash.The seventh elder spatted blood!This defied all logic. Today, three brats hurt him! But the brats were far from done and battered him with the thunderflame gale again.If he didn\u2019t do something now, he\u2019d be heavenly wounded, he may even die!The seventh elder braced himself and waved the centipede-like chain that suddenly appeared in his hand.Boom!The thunderflame gale attack was blown away as the elder took a few steps back. Zhuo Fan\u2019s side also shivered as each of them felt blood stagnating in their chest. It was a tie!\u201c4th-grade demonic treasure?\u201d Zhuo Fan turned serious.The seventh elder gasped and barked, \u201cGood, well done. I\u2019ve traveled the world for so long but today, three brats have reduced me to this state!\u201dHe turned to Zhuo Fan, \u201cI admit you\u2019re strong. If we continue, it will end with both sides dead. It\u2019s better to take your previous deal. Give me half of Diamond Sand and I will go!\u201dThe three exchanged glances. Xue Ningxiang and Xie Tianyang didn\u2019t want to offend Hell Valley and nodded. Zhuo Fan showed an amiable smile, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s make the deal!\u201dHe then jumped off the stone. The seventh elder took back his weapon and flew towards Zhuo Fan.When they were ten meters apart, suddenly both their eyes flashed with murderous intent.\u201cDie, brat!\u201d\u201cFinish him!\u201dShouting at the same time, the seventh elder revealed his demonic treasure and flung it at Zhuo Fan while the latter made hand signs.The flames and the centipede chain clashed.Xie Tianyang and Xue Ningxiang were startled. Even though they missed the first clash, they soon sent lightning and wind blade toward the elder.The seventh elder couldn\u2019t dodge and had to destroy their attacks with his chain once again, but he was also forced to retreat to the skies.Eyeing Zhuo Fan, the elder\u2019s face turned green and white from rage, \u201cBastard, who would believe you?\u201d\u201cHe-he-he, takes a demonic cultivator to know one!\u201d Zhuo Fan smirked.Xue Ningxiang and Xie Tianyang witnessed this in a daze.[Who the hell are they? One is more despicable than the other. None of them is worth trusting.]Both of them had only one thought since the beginning, kill.[They\u2019re too damn vile, treacherous, insidious\u2026][Had one of them trusted the other, then their side would have died by now.]This thought made the two gasp and their eyes darted at Zhuo Fan. [Thank god we have one just as vile and insidious among us. Or we\u2019d be dead for sure\u2026]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 - BaitPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay[I need to calm down first.] The seventh elder took a deep breath and inspected the area with wrinkled brows.He found that the recovery of Diamond Sand was becoming a headache, and when he knew the trio ran into the second area, he confirmed it.With his experience, he could easily discover their meager cultivation. And with the highest among them being the 7th layer of Bone Tempering Stage, it was no different than squeezing three insects.What was unbelievable though, one of them had a deep knowledge of arrays along with a cunning mind, unlike a rash and ignorant youth he posed to be.This led to the current predicament. With the three working together to control the array, he would never get the upper hand.However, he thought of something and his hawk-eyes flashed sinisterly.\u201cYou are Xue clan\u2019s third young miss!\u201dThe seventh elder ignored Zhuo Fan and switched targets, sizing Xue Ningxiang with a smile, \u201cI remember seeing you five years ago. You were just a child back then. My, how you\u2019ve grown into a fine lady.\u201dXue Ningxiang\u2019s heart seized and lowered her head to avoid his piercing gaze.Zhuo Fan shouted, \u201cSeventh elder, if you have something to say, say it to my face. Don\u2019t go around scaring girls!\u201dYet the seventh elder\u2019s eyes never left Xue Ningxiang, \u201cNing\u2019er, why do you bother going against me? Xue clan is a vassal of Hell Valley. We always took care of your Xue clan. And yet here you are, resorting to this\u2026\u201dHis eyes flashed with murder as he spoke. Xue Ningxiang shivered and could no longer keep the hand sign up.Zhuo Fan knew that the seventh elder was threatening Xue Ningxiang and rushed to say, \u201cAttack!\u201dHe and Xie Tianyang synced their hand signs, launching lightning and fire at the seventh elder. But Xue Ningxiang was still in a daze, her hands trembling.Xie Tianyang thought, [Damn, Xue Ningxiang is worried for her clan and has no will to fight. Without the wind\u2019s help, there\u2019ll be a sharp decline in power.]The seventh elder was fighting a psychological battle, grasping the trio\u2019s weakness.Fire and lightning combined as it neared the elder, but his centipede chain just flew at it and the attack was nulled. The seventh elder stood still in the sky while Zhuo Fan and Xie Tianyang spat blood!\u201cHa-ha-ha, that\u2019s better!\u201dThe seventh elder cackled, \u201cNing\u2019er, you made the right choice. These brats will wash their hands over this and leave from here, while your clan will stay forever.\u201dZhuo Fan looked at the shivering Xue Ningxiang and urged, \u201cNing\u2019er, don\u2019t listen to the old goat. He knows who you are and will destroy your clan either way. The only way to save the Xue clan is to kill him here and now. Remember my words, the Thunderflame Gale Array needs three people to work together and as long as the three are in sync, not even a Profound Heaven expert can escape!\u201dAnother shiver wreaked Xue Ningxiang\u2019s frail body and now she stood still. The seventh elder\u2019s words scared her but she had finally recovered.Zhuo Fan smirked and shouted, \u201cIf this old coot lives, your clan is no more!\u201dBoom!His words echoed in her ears and Xue Ningxiang rose her head to show killing intent for the first time as she muttered non stop, \u201cHe can\u2019t leave. He has to die, he must\u2026\u201cDIE!\u201dXue Ningxiang roared the last word and completed the hand sign.A green panther roared behind her and sped towards the seventh elder, ten times stronger than before.The elder panicked, noticing the true power of the array in Xue Ningxiang\u2019s hands. [From the start, the two brats used all they had in fighting me, yet she hadn\u2019t?]Xue Ningxiang was a kind and gentle soul, not willing to kill even her enemy. But the seventh elder\u2019s words struck a chord in her frail heart that she was close to losing her will for fighting.It was then that Zhuo Fan woke her up and lit a fire in her. The dissonance in her heart led to unleashing her full power.To protect her clan, Xue Ningxiang turned cold and unfeeling like a reaper. She was willing to do anything and everything to make sure the old geezer died here.Zhuo Fan and Xie Tianyang smiled and launched their own attacks. Fire, wind, and lightning combined at their strongest into an overpowering strike that threatened to consume the seventh elder.Even the calm and collected seventh elder was starting to feel fear. He hastily lifted the centipede chain and lashed.Boom!A huge explosion shook the entire second area and even the sky seemed to collapse. Some 4th level spiritual beasts even fled.The seventh elder, who was caught in the middle, was blasted a dozen meters with his hair and beard singed as he spat blood. But this time, the blood evaporated before it touched the ground.It was proof of the intensity of the attack that pierced his inner organs. With such a heavy wound, just one more and he\u2019d be done for!For the first time, the seventh elder panted with fear in his eyes. Not even he could foresee that the array needed just the girl to flip out for unleashing its full power.But he understood that he would not be able to take more of such attacks.\u201cHe\u2019s on his last leg. Ning\u2019er, Xie Tianyang, get ready. We\u2019ll finish him off.\u201d Zhuo Fan laughed as he made another hand sign.But a sudden green panther beat him and Xie Tianyang to the punch.All Zhuo Fan saw was Xue Ningxiang going crazy and making signs on and on as she raved, \u201cHe has to die, he must die\u2026\u201d[Damn, this girl has lost it. I managed to spur her on, but now she is too far gone. Her only thought is to kill the old goat, even disregarding cooperation with her allies.]Her action was limiting the array\u2019s power!The seventh elder noticed this weakness and smiled as he charged for Xue Ningxiang! He was only facing a wind panther, and without the other two elements, he could breeze through it. With a swing of the centipede chain, the panther was no more.\u201cQuickly help Ning\u2019er!\u201dZhuo Fan panicked as he formed hand signs alongside Xie Tianyang. Once again lightning and fire came at the seventh elder.Yet such lack of cooperation lost the array\u2019s advantage and the seventh elder dealt with it easily. He flung the centipede chain, removing this nuisance and appeared before Xue Ningxiang.But she sank in, making hand signs.The seventh elder snorted and clutched her neck, lifting her off the ground. Xue Ningxiang began suffocating and her hands slowed down.\u201cCrazy girl, you almost had me killed! Consider yourself lucky since you still have some use, or I\u2019d have killed you already.\u201d\u201cNing\u2019er!\u201dZhuo Fan and Xie Tianyang stood up with worry. The seventh elder mocked them, \u201cWhat are you brats called anyway? Sit tight, I will deal with you in a moment!\u201dZhuo Fan clenched his fists.\u201cCough, cough, cough\u2026\u201dXue Ningxiang coughed, looking at Zhuo Fan with pleading eyes, \u201cKill him, don\u2019t let him harm my father\u2026\u201d\u201cHe-he-he, what a carrying daughter. You\u2019re still thinking about your father? Too bad these two brats have no way of killing me. Once I get back, I\u2019ll make sure to wipe the Xue clan for good!\u201dTears glistened down Xue Ningxiang\u2019s cheeks.Xie Tianyang\u2019s heart hurt and roared in anger, \u201cHell Valley elder, does one of your stature even know what shame is to raise your hand on a defenseless girl?\u201d\u201cHe-he-he, there\u2019s no such thing as shame in a demonic cultivator\u2019s vocabulary.\u201d The seventh elder cackled and turned to Zhuo Fan, \u201cBrat, you\u2019re just like this old man, stirring this girl\u2019s will to fight with a few words. I would\u2019ve taken you as my disciple if not for us being enemies!\u201d\u201cYou hurt my friend, so you must die by my hands!\u201d Zhuo Fan\u2019s tone was irreproachable, \u201cXie Tianyang, get ready to strike!\u201d\u201cBut Ning\u2019er\u2026\u201d\u201cNing\u2019er\u2026 also agreed\u2026\u201d Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes flashed with a hard look. Xie Tianyang felt cold as he looked at Zhuo Fan, then saw the pleading eyes of Xue Ningxiang and sighed.[This old man must die, or he will slaughter the Xue clan and Ning\u2019er won\u2019t ever find peace, even in death.]Xie Tianyang then yelled as he made hand signs.The lightning dragon roared as it encroached on the seventh elder. Zhuo Fan, with his red eyes, also shouted and the phoenix behind him spread its wings.This was the strongest power they managed to unleash through their cooperation.But to all this, the seventh elder\u2019s answer was disdain, \u201cHumph, I have already figured out this array. Without wind, just you two are nothing!\u201dXie Tianyang gnashed his teeth. [Would our full power attack amount to nothing? Would we meet our end at his hands?][Furthermore, Ning\u2019er\u2019s clan would be doomed.]But Zhuo Fan revealed an evil grin, \u201cWho said we lacked wind?\u201dHis hands shifted through the signs and the seventh elder was swallowed by a tornado, turning his immediate surrounding into a wind prison.Then came the lightning dragon and fire phoenix.Boom!Fire and lightning mixed, erupting in a spectacular fashion on contact with the tornado, burning everything within into nothing. This display of power was twice as strong as their best attack.[This time the elder should be dead.]Xie Tianyang watched it all at a loss, \u201cH-how\u2026 w-what\u2026\u201d\u201cHow the wind appeared?\u201dZhuo Fan smiled, unlike someone who just lost a friend, \u201cI told you before that I can\u2019t control the 5th-grade array by myself and need all three of us to work together, right? Well, I lied. That seventh elder would\u2019ve seen through you and I couldn\u2019t have deceived him in the end.\u201d\u201cWhat, all\u2026 was a lie\u2026\u201d Xie Tianyang stammered.Zhuo Fan smiled, \u201cInsidious Demon is beyond sharp, he is Hell Valley\u2019s sage. If I fight him alone, defeat is certain. So I arranged for you two to work with me in controlling the array and help conserve power. But this wasn\u2019t without its weakness. Us three had to be in full cooperation to unleash its greatest power.\u201d\u201cHim being the Insidious Demon, he would find this out with ease and would target the weakest among us. It\u2019s clear Ning\u2019er is that person and he would attack her. But he would have never guessed Ning\u2019er was the bait I laid out for him. So, he fell right into my trap!\u201d\u201cY-you\u2019re saying that you had planned on giving up on Ning\u2019er from the start?\u201d Xie Tianyang gasped. Zhuo Fan felt like a stranger to him.He still recalled how Zhuo Fan yelled at Ning\u2019er, \u201cI won\u2019t leave anyone behind!\u201d his eyes filled with righteousness. [Was it all an act?]\u201cWhat\u2019s with that look?\u201d Zhuo Fan sneered, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say to leave Ning\u2019er behind and flee, that she was a burden? I only thought of a more appropriate use of this burden!\u201d\u201cWhat of your promise to her?\u201d Xie Tianyang swallowed dryly, \u201cI heard you promised Ning\u2019er to take her outside the city!\u201dZhuo Fan waved it off, \u201cThe result\u2019s the same, be it living or otherwise\u2026\u201dSeeing Zhuo Fan\u2019s casual manner, Xie Tianyang felt numb and a chill crawled up his spine.After working together for over a month, he had thought that he somewhat understood Zhuo Fan\u2019s character. But now it felt like he was talking to a stranger!Such sheer cruelty made him, a 7th layer of Bone Tempering expert, feel more fear than facing a Radiant Stage expert.But laughter came from amidst the thunderflame gale prison\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 - Insidious DemonPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHa-ha-ha, kid, you\u2019re just like me. Selfish, cruel, heartless, and won\u2019t even hesitate to use your own men. Even I\u2019m feeling a bit afraid of you!\u201dBoom!The thunderflame gale prison blew away with a loud noise to reveal the sinister smiling seventh elder. Yet now he held another centipede chain in his hand, this one black.The two chains formed a helix around him, sparing his life from the dreadful attack. But even so, his body was littered with burn marks, and one could even see the bone in some places as blood seeped out.It was obvious that he survived because of these chains.And that too against the true power of the Thunderflame Gale Array.After spitting some burning blood, the seventh elder gasped, but his wicked eyes never left Zhuo Fan for a moment.\u201cKid, I have always been quick to pick up on things related to my enemies everywhere I went, but today you almost had me killed! I have to admit, I never met such dreadful brat in my life.\u201dZhuo Fan looked over to see Xue Ningxiang unconscious at his feet. But she wasn\u2019t dead. Perhaps the chain helix protected her the same way it protected the elder.But it wasn\u2019t like Zhuo Fan cared if she lived or died. He just kept staring at the black centipede chain, \u201cYou have another 4th-grade demonic treasure?\u201d\u201cHe-he-he, I used to have only one!\u201dThe seventh elder joined the two centipede chains together to form a black and white chain, \u201cThis 4th-grade demonic treasure, Yin Yang Chains are of one body. I usually attack with the yang chain and use the yin chain to kill my enemy at the right time. But to save myself today, you forced me to reveal my yin chain. You should be proud of that. Even Profound Heaven experts only figure out the truth at the moment of their deaths!\u201dZhuo Fan gnashed his teeth, \u201cThe Insidious Demon title fits you like a glove! You were willing to suffer a heavy wound just to keep this move hidden!\u201d\u201cBut of course!\u201dThe seventh elder coughed blood twice but his face still retained the sinister smile, \u201cWith how the world is filled with lies and schemes, I prefer to keep my strongest move hidden. That is why my ploys always succeed while the ones against me fail!\u201d\u201cBut today is the exception!\u201dThe seventh elder\u2019s eyes flashed and threw the yang chain at Zhuo Fan and the yin chain at Xie Tianyang as he roared, \u201cToo bad you\u2019re out of tricks and can\u2019t beat me!\u201d\u201cI beg to differ.\u201d Zhuo Fan smirked and made a hand sign, making a bloody light fly out of Xue Ningxiang towards the seventh elder.The elder was seriously hurt and the chains were far away. Zhuo Fan watched him like a hawk just to find if he also had a defensive demonic treasure.This way he could put Blood Infant to good use.In his sorry state, if Blood Infant was to get inside the seventh elder, he\u2019d be refined without even a means to resist.This was Zhuo Fan\u2019s true killing move. Even the thunderflame gale prison was only used as bait to reveal all the elder\u2019s cards.Zhuo Fan refused to believe a man with the Insidious Demon fame had no hidden means to save himself.\u201cDemonic creature!\u201dOn the other hand, the seventh elder was startled by the bloody light. He now figured out what Zhuo Fan really intended when he said Xue Ningxiang was the bait.It wasn\u2019t just to trap him in the thunderflame gale prison but to also hide a killing move. With how close he was to her, he had no way of dodging.Insidious Demon had to admire Zhuo Fan\u2019s cunning mind for beating him at every turn.Zhuo Fan was expectant of victory as he smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s over, seventh elder. This fight is my win\u2026\u201dSuddenly, the seventh elder\u2019s yang chain pierced through Zhuo Fan\u2019s chest. He felt his heart being crushed. A large hole was left behind on his body, with pieces of his heart here and there.\u201cThis is impossible\u2026\u201dZhuo Fan was confident that the Blood Infant would gain control of the seventh elder once it entered him, also stopping the yang chain\u2019s attack.But the truth was, the chain never stopped. Zhuo Fan even felt his organs withering and seeping life force.This wasn\u2019t caused by the chain, but by Blood Infant\u2019s injury!Puking blood, Zhuo Fan watched in shock as Blood Infant hung behind the seventh elder. A flash of silver revealed a needle impaling Blood Infant\u2019s chest.\u201c3rd-grade demonic treasure, Twisted Needle!\u201dThe seventh elder sneered at Zhuo Fan and pulled back the Twisted Needle into his elbow.Blood Infant collapsed and Zhuo Fan fell to his knees. His eyes were filled with dread. He couldn\u2019t believe he just lost.Bam!A sound was heard from the side, Xie Tianyang struggled for his life but the yin chain lashed over his chest and he was now spitting blood. It was thanks to his spiritual armor that he was still breathing!Ignoring the rest, the seventh elder walked to Zhuo Fan calmly.\u201cKid, I am known as the Insidious Demon. How can anyone outsmart me?\u201dThe seventh elder watched the dying Zhuo Fan, \u201cYou\u2019re good, real good. Your schemes even make me feel fear. In a decade or two, you will become an outstanding demonic cultivator! Not even the number one sage in Tianyu can compare to you. A pity you won\u2019t live so long, because I am afraid, afraid of what you\u2019ll become. You are the first to ever make me feel this way\u2026\u201dHe was about to land the finishing blow, \u201cYou might die at my hand, but do not feel bad. Our cunningness is about the same, but I am stronger. In front of true power, all tricks, all methods are moot\u2026 \u201cThe seventh elder\u2019s palm came from above and Zhuo Fan could even hear the whistling wind.He didn\u2019t want to die, but he had nothing left to fight with.A loss was a loss, be it in power or cunningness. And the one to lose, died! But he had so many things he wanted to do.So what? The loser never had a choice to begin with!Closing his eyes, Zhuo Fan took one last breath and blacked out\u2026Roar!A sudden roar shook the entire Allbeast Mountain Range and the seventh elder\u2019s palm stopped an inch above Zhuo Fan\u2019s head.Along with the roar, a wave of flames came to engulf everything. It swallowed trees and left empty husks behind.The seventh elder was startled.Looking towards the third area, he said with uncertainty, \u201cWhy is this monster coming to the second area\u2026\u201dTaking another look at the hopeless trio, he gnashed his teeth and fled, even disregarding the Diamond Sand.A bird cry soon followed and the skies darkened. A huge bird wing trailed above, overshadowing the earth.The spiritual beasts shivered in their caves.The huge bird\u2019s wing burned blue, and each flap sent sparks everywhere. Wherever the sparks landed, flames torched all of it into nothing.The previously lush forest was now reduced to ash after the bird passed. Not even bones were left of the 4th level spiritual beasts touched by the flames.The huge bird flew for a while then left, but the forest beneath it was no more.Zhuo Fan and the other two were lying unconscious among the ashes. Some spiritual beasts passed by but finding them dead, they left.In fact, it was thanks to the Energy Concealing Pill that hid their auras.Cough, cough, cough\u2026With a light cough, Xue Ningxiang strained her eyes open, but shock swept her heart. [Why is the forest gone and only ash remained?][The seventh elder couldn\u2019t have done this.]She looked around in haste for Zhuo Fan and Xie Tianyang and saw them lying unconscious. Zhuo Fan had the most critical injury, bleeding from the hole in his chest.He wasn\u2019t too far from breathing his last\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His face paled by the second and his temperature dropped.Tears welled in Xue Ningxiang\u2019s eyes and fell along with her anxious voice, \u201cBrother Zhuo, wake up, wake up\u2026\u201dPerhaps it was the soft tears or the incessant shouts grating on his ears that made Zhuo Fan crack his eyelids.\u201cBrother Zhuo, you\u2019re awake!\u201d Xue Ningxiang was glad.Zhuo Fan moved his lips but was too weak to even let out words.Watching her tear-stained face, Zhuo Fan took a deep breath and squeezed his last drop of energy into pointing, but his hand soon fell limp.Xue Ningxiang caught his gesture and saw Blood Infant in a pool of blood.\u201cYou want me to bring it over?\u201d She asked.Zhuo Fan blinked weakly, the only thing he could do in his current state. Xue Ningxiang thus marched to Blood Infant and was soon back with it in her arms. She then placed it on the hole in Zhuo Fan\u2019s chest.Blood Infant flashed red and was back in Zhuo Fan\u2019s body. He let out a breath as his complexion started improving slightly.His and Blood Infant\u2019s lives were shared, so much so that its wound was far more important than his own injury. As long as Blood Infant was fine, him suffering heavy wounds would matter little. But now Blood Infant\u2019s life hung by a thread. Without his blood essence, he could only keep it alive for a short while longer.He was in a worse condition too and had no way to save it. But as Blood Infant was kept alive a bit of energy returned to him.\u201cB-blood\u2026\u201d Zhuo Fan whispered hoarsely.Xue Ningxiang paused a moment, then cut her wrist with a dagger and brought her hand to Zhuo Fan\u2019s lips.The girl\u2019s blood dripped in Zhuo Fan\u2019s mouth and he slowly recovered a bit more energy.Xue Ningxiang let out a relieved sigh and even sported a faint smile.But Zhuo Fan suddenly bit her wrist, sucking the blood out. Xue Ningxiang braced through the pain and let him have his fill.Time passed but Zhuo Fan\u2019s appetite didn\u2019t drop. Xue Ningxiang\u2019s face paled and was even getting woozy.She knew it was from the blood loss but she didn\u2019t stop him.When Zhuo Fan finally let go and gasped for fresh air, he saw Xue Ningxiang\u2019s pale countenance and felt complicated.\u201cThank you.\u201d Zhuo Fan now had the strength to speak, thanks to the blood. Xue Ningxiang smiled. She was feeling weak but her smile looked mesmerizing to Zhuo Fan.Recalling his previous act, his heart began to feel guilt.With a thought, a blue bottle flashed in his hand.\u201cNing\u2019er, these are 3rd-grade Heart Protecting Pills. Give me one, you take the second and give the third to the kid if he isn\u2019t dead.\u201dXue Ningxiang nodded and fed the first pill to him. She checked Xie Tianyang and found him alive. Excited, she fed him a pill but saved hers.Zhuo Fan was laid on the ground but his heart was clear, \u201cNing\u2019er, you are also hurt. Why aren\u2019t you taking it?\u201dNing\u2019er shook her head, \u201cIt\u2019s only a scratch. This pill is too precious and it\u2019s better used on you two.\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, not in the least. It came from Veiled Dragon Pavilion anyway, so don\u2019t worry!\u201d Zhuo Fan smiled. He came to Allbeast Mountain Range prepared, not only in spirit stones but also in pills.Since the Imperial family and Veiled Dragon Pavilion were providing the Luo clan with stuff, he had everything besides the truly rare pills. Some of his pills were something not found even in the entire Tianyu Empire, refined by yours truly.[I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d use them so fast!]\u201cNing\u2019er, take it, it\u2019s yours!\u201dA snort came and Xue Ningxiang turned towards Xie Tianyang. He was also worse for wear, not life-threatened like Zhuo Fan, but he couldn\u2019t move still.He would need 3-5 months to heal.Zhuo Fan couldn\u2019t budge but neither could he. Even so, his fear of Zhuo Fan wasn\u2019t that high and said with a clipped tone, \u201cNing\u2019er, this big brother Zhuo wanted to use you as bait from the start. This is his just deserts!\u201dWhen Zhuo Fan exposed his plan, she was already unconscious in the thunderflame gale prison explosion. But hearing it now, she was startled and looked at Zhuo Fan with the hope that he\u2019d deny.She refused to believe that Brother Zhuo, who stood by her side for over a month, would be so cruel as to throw her away.She hoped this was a misunderstanding, that Zhuo Fan would refute Xie Tianyang\u2019s claims. But Zhuo Fan remained silent, and his cold eyes refused to meet hers for the first time.With tears welling, Xue Ningxiang forced her sorrow down, but her heart felt like being stabbed with a knife.She didn\u2019t realize when, but Zhuo Fan meant a lot to her. She didn\u2019t feel hate for being cast out, but pain\u2026Sensing her pain, Zhuo Fan hesitated, \u201cNing\u2019er, I\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, you don\u2019t need to say anything.\u201dXue Ningxiang wiped her nose and forced a smile, \u201cI know Brother Zhuo is brave and smart, that all went according to your plan. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a misunderstanding.\u201dShe whipped her head around and left, \u201cI\u2019m going to look for branches and make a stretcher. We can\u2019t keep staying here.\u201dWatching her walk away like nothing had happened, Xie Tianyang rose an eyebrow, \u201cHey, Ning\u2019er, you\u2019re going to forgive him just like that? He is hurt and can\u2019t move. Now\u2019s your chance for revenge.\u201dYet Xue Ningxiang didn\u2019t return\u2026Xie Tianyang wanted to yell again but then Zhuo Fan\u2019s snort came, \u201cZip it. If you want to die, just ask!\u201d\u201cHumph, you have it worse than me, let\u2019s see you try!\u201dXie Tianyang put up a tough front but fear gnawed his heart because of the naked killing intent laced in Zhuo Fan\u2019s words.Seeing with his own eyes how Zhuo Fan had fought the seventh elder, he knew the horror Zhuo Fan could unleash. Despite losing, Zhuo Fan played with that Insidious Demon to such a state.He felt both fear and hatred towards Zhuo Fan.Hate for his unfeeling heart to his friends and fear from his cunning mind. But then a new feeling triumphed them both, something the genius disciple of Sword Marquise Abode never felt before, awe.Xue Ningxiang was soon back with wood and made two stretchers. When she placed them both on each, Zhuo Fan wanted to apologize but swallowed his words when he saw her avoiding him.Rumble!With a thunderclap, the rain started pouring down on the ashen forest and helped the saplings grow.Xue Ningxiang tied the stretchers with rope and trudged through the mud. Because of the heavy rain, the rough mountain path, and the blood loss, she fell down again and again.But she pressed on like a machine, dragging them ever forward.The three never spoke a word the entire time. Even Xie Tianyang\u2019s complaints about taking revenge fell silent.The two felt worse and worse the more they saw Xue Ningxiang\u2019s pale face as she pulled them.Xie Tianyang was the first to mention casting her away for being weak. Zhuo Fan went a step further by rejecting the idea in a dignified manner, only to throw her out as bait not much later.And now, the two were in dire straits, useless for months to come. But Xue Ningxiang\u2019s heart remained steady and firm, never abandoning them.The two felt heavy in their hearts from the huge debt they had for her. [How can we ever repay it?]On the muddy and slick mountain road, a bump appeared and the Burrowing Mouse revealed itself. It ran towards Xue Ningxiang as soon as it came out.Now that she saw the little guy, her smile came back on her face, since losing it when she found of Zhuo Fan\u2019s betrayal.Afraid of critter suffering, she drove it away before their fight with the seventh elder. But now it came back.The little guy was jumping around her leg in joy then skipped ahead of her.Xue Ningxiang guessed that it was showing the way and dragged the stretchers to a cave.Happy, she pulled the two people into the cave for sheltering from the rain and healing their wounds.But Zhuo Fan looked around once and shouted in panic, \u201cWe can\u2019t stay here, we have to leave now!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 - Heaven-shaking RoarPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayXue Ningxiang turned to Zhuo Fan with a start.Zhuo Fan spoke while gazing at the weeds around the cave, \u201cThat is Soothing Grass!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s perfect, it can help relieve fatigue. What is wrong with that?\u201d Xie Tianyang asked.Zhuo Fan said annoyed, \u201cThat\u2019s true for humans, but for spiritual beasts, it has a calming effect that attracts nearby spiritual beasts.\u201dXie Tianyang was anxious, \u201cThat means\u2026 trap?\u201dZhuo Fan nodded, \u201cYes, a trap made by predators. The Burrowing Mouse was drawn here and led us right to it!\u201d\u201cCurses, you can just bury your head and run, but we\u2019ll have to suffer. Why had I taken you in any way?\u201d Xie Tianyang snapped at the critter.He wasn\u2019t as brash usually, but he was now hurt and powerless to resist an attack. In this grim state, falling in a trap was the last straw.To escape from the seventh elder yet die in a beast\u2019s trap was something this genius disciple couldn\u2019t accept.The Burrowing Mouse squeaked a few times with a lowered head.Xue Ningxiang hugged it to her chest and spoke softly to Zhuo Fan, \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201dShe had ill-feelings towards Zhuo Fan but she always turned to him for help when the going got tough.\u201cWhat else?! Run!\u201d Xie Tianyang cut him off.Zhuo Fan asked hastily, \u201cWhat time is it?\u201dXue Ningxiang looked outside the cave, but the rain clouds blocked the sky. She shook her head, \u201cI\u2019m not sure, a day must\u2019ve passed by now.\u201d\u201cDamn!\u201d Zhuo Fan said gravely, \u201cThe Energy Concealing Pill must have worn off and we are now easy targets. I\u2019m guessing beasts must be coming here in droves!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Xie Tianyang jumped, \u201cYou said\u2026 droves?\u201dZhuo Fan nodded, \u201cThe truly strong spiritual beasts don\u2019t stoop so low to use this trick. Only low-level spiritual beasts place traps and move in packs.\u201dJust then, along with the sound of rain, roars of beast echoed, and several pairs of cruel eyes fixed on the cave\u2019s mouth.A rough look would spot around a thousand heads.\u201cBloodthirsty Wolves!\u201dZhuo Fan sighed, \u201cWe\u2019re finished. Bloodthirsty Wolves are 2nd level spiritual beasts but with their numbers, they must have a 3rd level wolf king among them. Not even a 4th level spiritual beast would dare to mess with them.\u201dXie Tianyang saw the faint green eyes getting ever closer, \u201cWoe is me! Heaven must be jealous of my outstanding talent and wants to pluck me.\u201dXue Ningxiang looked worried while Zhuo Fan had his trademark unflappable expression.\u201cXie Tianyang!\u201dZhuo Fan said, \u201cGive your sword to Ning\u2019er!\u201d\u201cNing\u2019er?\u201d Xie Tianyang didn\u2019t understand, \u201cMy Star Sword may be a 4th-grade spiritual weapon, but Ning\u2019er is in the Qi Condensation Stage. It\u2019s not enough to deal with those savage beasts.\u201dHe spoke of the difference in cultivation and leveled his eyes at Zhuo Fan, \u201cShe isn\u2019t like you, fighting Bone Tempering and Profound Heaven experts while in Qi Condensation Stage.\u201dZhuo Fan smiled, \u201cNing\u2019er won\u2019t be fighting the beasts, but escaping their encirclement.\u201dHe took out a bottle from his ring but didn\u2019t have the strength to lift it.\u201cNing\u2019er, take this Energy Concealing Pill.\u201dZhuo Fan spoke calmly, \u201cUse it to leave Allbeast Mountain Range once you break the encirclement, but don\u2019t go to your clan. Leave the city.\u201dXie Tianyang now understood Zhuo Fan\u2019s plan. So he too took out his Star Sword.Their debt to Ning\u2019er was too great, and at this point, they were nothing but dead weights.Seeing their firm gazes, Xue Ningxiang took the sword and ran outside.Both Xie Tianyang and Zhuo Fan revealed a smile, feeling a weight being lifted off their chests.\u201cThis way, we can repay her kindness. Even if we die, we can do it free of regrets!\u201d Xie Tianyang mumbled.Zhuo Fan spoke blandly, \u201cI don\u2019t care about returning favors, just felt unwilling to die like this. I just don\u2019t want this girl to keep looking after me.\u201d\u201cHumph, how cold-hearted!\u201d Xie Tianyang snapped.After that short banter, the two were at peace, waiting for the Bloodthirsty Wolves to devour them.But then wails came, followed by blood splattering on both of them.When they looked towards the mouth of the cave, they were shocked to see Xue Ningxiang standing guard at the entrance. Some Bloodthirsty Wolves were circling around trying to enter but were cut down by her.With her standing guard and this being the only entrance, the wolves were kept at bay.\u201cNing\u2019er, what are you doing?\u201d Zhuo Fan shouted.Xue Ningxiang slashed and three more wolves fell. She looked back with a shy smile, \u201cSee, with me standing here, they will never get in!\u201d\u201cIdiot, those are nothing but cannon fodder. The wolf king wouldn\u2019t care if they died. He\u2019s trying to tire you out before killing you!\u201d Zhuo Fan cursed, but his eyes were filled with worry.Xue Ningxiang smiled, \u201cThat wolf king is a beast uncaring for his pack, but you are my most important friends. I won\u2019t abandon you.\u201dShe killed another two incoming wolves.Because of the blood loss and the fatigue of carrying the two, she felt weak and pale. She was shaking with the wind and seemed like she might collapse any second. Yet her eyes were headstrong.Xue Ningxiang slashed, again and again, piling wolf corpses at her feet in a pool of blood.Her brows were drenched, her breathing haggard, her arms numb, but her back remained straight against the incoming storm.Watching her frail body, Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes filled with warmth.He closed his eyes, not wishing to see the end as pain laced his heart.\u201cZhuo Fan!\u201dXie Tianyang yelled, \u201cI just realized, we\u2019re both damn bastards.\u201d\u201cEn!\u201dZhuo Fan groaned a response. Xie Tianyang looked over to Xue Ningxiang braving outside and he also closed his eyes.\u201cAh!\u201dXue Ningxiang let out a cry as a wolf bit her wrist when her strength failed her. It then pinned her to the ground.Then another wolf pounced on her other hand. She wanted to get up and keep fighting but felt too weak to move. She had surpassed the limits of her body long ago and was now powerless to deal with two weak wolves. She couldn\u2019t even feel the blood flowing out from the bite wounds on her hands.Zhuo Fan and Xie Tianyang knew this was going to happen but kept their eyes closed. They wanted to be spared from the sight of the girl getting mauled.While two wolves pinned her arms, the rest were closing in as Xue Ningxiang\u2019s breathing grew faint.If they could, the two in the cave would\u2019ve covered their ears.In celebration of a successful hunt, the pack howled and the wolf king, three times bigger than the rest, strutted before Xue Ningxiang.Licking its fangs, the wolf king howled and opened its maw to ravage Xue Ningxiang.With her eyes blacking out, all she could see were vague shapes.Zhuo Fan and Xie Tianyang still had their eyes closed.Roar!Just as the wolf king was about to bite her, a sudden roar echoed from deep within the Allbeast Mountain Range. Zhuo Fan and Xie Tianyang blanked out the moment it reached them.The thousand Bloodthirsty Wolves pack collapsed one after the other, with only the wolf king staggering from fear.But before it could retreat, a flame swept over the wolves, not even leaving ash behind.Even the wolf king couldn\u2019t survive and disappeared from this world.Unbelievable enough, Zhuo Fan\u2019s party survived unharmed, though unconscious\u2026\u201cZhuo Fan!\u201dZhuo Fan vaguely heard someone calling him and opened his eyes.[What is with this foggy place? Where am I?] He looked around.But then it occurred to him, he was heavily wounded so how could he move?Suddenly, two blue flames ignited. It fused together to reveal a burning blue-robed figure floating high above.\u201cIs your name Zhuo Fan? I heard the two kids call you as such!\u201d The figure smiled. His voice fit a sturdy middle-aged man, but it wasn\u2019t clear from his appearance.Zhuo Fan was suspicious, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know.\u201d The figure replied, \u201cThis is my domain, and here, I ask the questions!\u201d\u201cZhuo Fan, why have you come to Allbeast Mountain Range?\u201d the blue figure asked.Zhuo Fan thought for a moment, \u201cTo capture a spiritual beast and make it my demonic creature!\u201d\u201cWhat spiritual beast?\u201d\u201c6th level spiritual beast, Thunder Skylark!\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s eyes swiveled, \u201cWhy else, to increase my power!\u201dBoom!A loud noise resounded and Zhuo Fan felt like his head was about to explode.\u201cHa-ha-ha\u2026\u201d The figure laughed, \u201cBoy, we are inside your consciousness. It\u2019s easy for me to tell when you lie.\u201dZhuo Fan looked at the figure in fear.He could enter other\u2019s consciousness on his own. Such power went beyond Radiant Stage, maybe even above the mortal domain.\u201cAre you\u2026 from the Sacred Domain\u2026\u201d Zhuo Fan gasped.He never thought that it was possible to run into a Sacred Domain\u2019s expert in the mortal domain.The figure was also surprised that Zhuo Fan knew about Sacred Domain and nodded, \u201cYou aren\u2019t normal to know of Sacred Domain, to apply ancient arrays, and refine the Blood Infant\u2026\u201dZhuo Fan was shocked to find that all his actions were monitored, this man even knew of Blood Infant.Matters regarding Patriarch Blood Demon were decades old and very few people knew of them even in the Sacred Domain. If he hadn\u2019t stumbled upon the Nine Serenities Secret Records, he would be none the wiser.But\u2026\u201cW-who exactly are you?\u201d\u201cI said it before, only I ask the questions here!\u201d The figure replied coldly, \u201cWhy do you want the Thunder Skylark. Speak the truth!\u201dZhuo Fan was pensive, but found no way out, \u201cI want to go to Lightning Canyon and search for the Heavenly Emperor\u2019s remnant. For that, I need the Thunder Skylark to block the purple lightning!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe blue figure never anticipated such an answer, but laughed in glee, \u201cHa-ha-ha, good. Great even. That is a good place. You should definitely go!\u201dThe figure vanished and popped right in front of Zhuo Fan\u2019s face. Zhuo Fan was startled but didn\u2019t pick up any bad intentions from him.The figure then tapped Zhuo Fan\u2019s forehead and a blue flame seeped in. Zhuo Fan only felt gentle energy from his forehead.\u201cHa-ha-ha, boy, we are fated so here\u2019s a gift. I hope you can help me in the future!\u201dThe figure was gone but his words rang in Zhuo Fan\u2019s ears, \u201cYou can find the Thunder Skylark three thousand miles into the third area. Do your best to catch it\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A ray of sunshine shone through the cave\u2019s mouth and forced him to cover his eyes.To his surprise, he found that he could actually move.Although still weak, he was mostly recovered. Inspecting himself in detail, he found the Blood Infant laying depressed in his Dantian but its life was no longer hanging by a thread. Even its eyes were trembling, on the verge of waking up.Being shocked was an understatement. Zhuo Fan knew the expert he met last night was someone who rose above the mortal domain. Or he wouldn\u2019t have had the ability to heal his wounds overnight along with Blood Infant\u2019s.\u201cBut\u2026 why did he choose me?\u201dZhuo Fan rubbed his forehead, recalling that the man had planted something there. But his weak self didn\u2019t allow him to see clearly what it was.He shook his head in the end, [It doesn\u2019t matter, anyway he saved me. Whatever his reasons are, I will figure them out sooner or later.]With his current strength, what could he do against that man?Mocking himself, he realized that he was overthinking things sometimes. It had to do with the fact that he was in the 6th layer of Qi Condensation with the heart of an Emperor Stage expert. [What a pain!]So, his current objective was to boost his strength. The strong had the final say in everything.He sighed as he looked at the incoming sunshine. Despite the somber feeling exuding from the burned trees, the sun brought a ray of hope.A groan interrupted his musing and Zhuo Fan found Xue Ningxiang\u2019s weak figure in a pool of blood. He rushed to her and fed a Heart Protecting Pill.A gentle Yuan Qi traveled within her body and Zhuo Fan breathed easy.The girl\u2019s wounds were only skin deep. She had overused her Yuan Qi in her fight against the Bloodthirsty Wolves and needed just a few days to recover.But the pale face of Xue Ningxiang brought another wave of worry in his heart. He then started to remove the dirt from her face.Feeling his rough hand, Xue Ningxiang cracked her eyes open and showed a sweet smile.\u201cBrother Zhuo, are we dead?\u201d\u201cRest easy, we are alive and well!\u201d\u201cLiar, how are you able to move when you were so hurt?\u201d Xue Ningxiang mumbled, \u201cBut\u2026 at least we died together\u2026\u201dAnd the girl faded into unconsciousness at the last word.Zhuo Fan watched her peaceful expression and carried her inside the cave to lay her next to the Soothing Grass. It was the best item in relieving fatigue for humans.Now he was standing beside the unconscious Xie Tianyang, with a not so friendly face.\u201cYo, get up, up I say!Zhuo Fan kicked him lightly, twice for good measure, but he was still as a rock.Zhuo Fan sneered and swung his leg way back before kicking with enough oomph on Xie Tianyang\u2019s ass!\u201cAh!\u201dA wail that shook the heavens and the forest was heard. It even frightened the spiritual beasts around.[I say, what\u2019s with this ghastly yell? Trying to wake the heavens? The Allbeast Mountain Range doesn\u2019t lack dreadful monsters you know\u2026]Xie Tianyang shivered as he reined in his tears, \u201cWhat is this place? What did I ever do to deserve such cruelty even in death?\u201d\u201cIs kicking once cruel? You, a Sword Marquise Abode young master have seen nothing yet!\u201d Zhuo Fan smiled at Xie Tianyang\u2019s shocked face.Xie Tianyang was startled seeing Zhuo Fan, \u201cDid you kick me? Why the hell\u2026 we clearly died together, so why can you hit me?\u201dZhuo Fan grinned, \u201cIf we\u2019re dead, all of us would be equals. Too bad, we are alive and kicking. And since you weren\u2019t moving\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat, we\u2019re alive?\u201dXie Tianyang stopped listening after that and laughed, \u201cHa-ha-ha, it\u2019s the same cave. We are alive!\u201dBut then his mood soured, eying Zhuo Fan up and down before yelling, \u201cWhy are you able to move while I can\u2019t? You had it far worse than me and your cultivation is weaker too\u2026\u201dZhuo Fan shrugged and perked an eyebrow, exasperating the self-entitled genius disciple.Xie Tianyang\u2019s lip quivered as he wailed in frustration, \u201cFreak!\u201dNot for the life of him could he comprehend how Zhuo Fan was jumping around after having his life hanging by a thread just two days ago! Even he, a Bone Tempering expert, would need two months of recovery to be able to stand.He was vexed enough knowing that Zhuo Fan was stronger than him, despite their realm difference, and better skilled than him, despite their differences in background. Now though, this damn punk showed a miracle, jumping back on his feet in no time at all.[How can one even bloody compare? It\u2019s like being left light-years behind\u2026]\u201cZhuo Fan, tell me the truth. Who the heck are you?\u201d Xie Tianyang spat.Zhuo Fan lost his smile and patted Xie Tianyang\u2019s shoulder, \u201cHuman of course, though just slightly above-average!\u201dXie Tianyang was pissed off by Zhuo Fan\u2019s attitude. But his bad state didn\u2019t help him vent.And even if he could move, Zhuo Fan\u2019s array would just splatter him into pieces.This made bitter tears flow down his cheeks. A genius disciple\u2019s pride was crushed completely!Nonetheless, Zhuo Fan moving about had its upside. He could set up an array to defend them.Xie Tianyang had nothing to say to that. It brought far more advantage with Zhuo Fan recovered than if it was him instead. His cultivation only helped protect himself in such a place, let alone others.Spirit stones flew out of his ring and Zhuo Fan set up an ancient 1st-grade concealing array.At that moment, the cave disappeared from this place and not even a 6th level spiritual beast would find it even if they passed through.The trio could finally heal in peace.Xue Ningxiang woke up three days later and was wild with joy knowing that they weren\u2019t dead.Then she wondered where those wolves went and why they didn\u2019t eat the trio.Xie Tianyang was unclear about this too but Zhuo Fan frowned, finding it tied to the expert he met in his consciousness.It was in this manner the trio recouped for three months. Zhuo Fan was back to full health while Xie Tianyang could now exert 70% of his power. Xue Ningxiang recovered long ago and spent her time playing with the Burrowing Mouse.Both of them were happy seeing her smile again, thinking of her like a little sister. Xue Ningxiang too started to feel more dependent on the two\u2026Whoosh!A hundred meters away from the cave, Xie Tianyang hacked a rock as he smiled towards Xue Ningxiang not far away. He clearly recovered to 80%.Xue Ningxiang clapped excitedly alongside the Burrowing Mouse.Zhuo Fan walked over with a smile, \u201cNice power you have there. You should enter the 8th layer of Bone Tempering Stage soon.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you also entered the 7th layer of Qi Condensation after your wounds healed?\u201d Xie Tianyang clipped, \u201cBesides, Zhuo Fan, how can your eyes be that good? To detect me breaking through before I do?\u201dXue Ningxiang waved her hand to placate them, \u201cWhy are you always arguing when you meet each other? You weren\u2019t like this before!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it his fault?\u201d Xie Tianyang stuck out his chest and cursed Zhuo Fan, \u201cAfter all this time, I still can\u2019t forgive this brat for using Ning\u2019er as bait! How can I not be pissed? What arguing, I\u2019m itching to give him a beating.\u201d\u201cPot calling the kettle black. Who was it that said to dump her and stall the seventh elder?\u201d Zhuo Fan countered.\u201cI never\u2026\u201d Xie Tianyang was at a loss, but soon recovered his courage, \u201cI didn\u2019t know Ning\u2019er was so great, alright? Moreover, it\u2019s far better than being used as bait.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a demonic cultivator. It\u2019s normal to be more immoral than a righteous cultivator like you.\u201d\u201cImmoral? You\u2019re a bloody criminal by comparison\u2026\u201d\u2026Seeing Zhuo Fan and Xie Tianyang quarreling over her, Xue Ningxiang gestured for them to stop, \u201cCome on, don\u2019t argue, it\u2019s all in the past. I don\u2019t care anymore, so why are you bringing it up?\u201d\u201cNo, I want to give you justice.\u201dXie Tianyang grabbed her shoulders while glaring at the smiling Zhuo Fan.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, we are friends who braved through life and death together. It\u2019s water under the bridge!\u201d Xue Ningxiang showed a smile at the two and extended a pinkie.Xie Tianyang smiled wryly and was hesitant in extending his pinkie, but he did nonetheless. He was followed by an indifferent Zhuo Fan. The three pinkies touched and they started to feel warm and fuzzy inside.Finding a close friend in life was hard, but finding one to brave death alongside oneself was even harder.From now on, they would never abandon each other, no matter what. Zhuo Fan suspected he\u2019d be hard-pressed to find any closer friends in this life.As they took back their respective fingers, Zhuo Fan smiled, \u201cNow that we have recovered, we will each go our own way.\u201dStartled, the two didn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d say this.Zhuo Fan shook his head, \u201cSorry, that was my mistake. I want to leave. Xie Tianyang, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t take her out of the city. Help her in my stead.\u201d\u201cBrother Zhuo, where are you going?\u201d Xue Ningxiang felt nervous.Zhuo Fan replied with a determined tone, \u201cThe third area!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Xie Tianyang and Xue Ningxiang shouted, \u201cAt first we wanted to avoid the seventh elder by going there, but why would you still want to go?\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s eyes flashed with guilt, \u201cTo be honest, it was my objective from the start. I wanted to go together because\u2026 you were useful\u2026\u201d\u201cBastard, you wanted more baits?\u201d Xie Tianyang cursed.Zhuo Fan nodded, \u201cYes, so if you don\u2019t want to die, run along. The farther from me the better!\u201dAs he replied, Zhuo Fan turned to leave.\u201cWait!\u201dXue Ningxiang pulled his hand with a shy smile, \u201cBrother Zhuo, if you don\u2019t consider me as a burden, take me with you. Even if I were to become bait, it is alright as long as I can stay with you!\u201dZhuo Fan was startled and his heart throbbed.Xie Tianyang advised, \u201cHey, Ning\u2019er, this guy\u2019s no good\u2026\u201dBut Xue Ningxiang\u2019s gentle eyes only had Zhuo Fan in them, and so Xie Tianyang also reluctantly chose to put his hands together with theirs.Zhuo Fan raised an eyebrow, \u201cYou too want to follow me?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Xie Tianyang felt lifeless, \u201cBut don\u2019t misunderstand, I\u2019m not coming to help you but to make sure you don\u2019t betray Ning\u2019er.\u201dZhuo Fan smiled.[With how smart you are, I might go and betray you both!]But he didn\u2019t voice it, meeting the two of them could be considered as his fortune.Friends in life and death were hard to find\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 - Savage ClashPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe forest in Allbeast Mountain Range\u2019s third area was so thick it blotted out the sun. It was also packed with vicious spiritual beasts that roared at any passing moment. It painted such a gruesome picture that struck terror in any who were intent in setting foot inside!Suddenly, a low bush stirred despite the lack of wind.Zhuo Fan\u2019s party stuck to the ground as they crawled, making use of the bushes as cover. They did take Energy Concealing Pills, but unlike the previous areas, if any spiritual beast saw them here, it spelled doom.As such, this was the only viable way to advance, moving at a crawl 3,000 miles inland.With each roar and cry, fear struck, soaking their brows with sweat.\u201cBlast it! We\u2019ll never get anywhere crawling like this!\u201dAfter half a day of wiggling through ten miles, Xie Tianyang complained and sat with arms crossed, \u201cI\u2019m not doing it anymore. It\u2019s too lame! Besides, you think a 5th level spiritual beast lies at every corner?\u201d\u201cFool, get down before it\u2019s too late!\u201d Zhuo Fan cursed.Xie Tianyang smirked in disdain, \u201cHow will that help? With how tall the fauna is here, you think they\u2019ll spot us at a glance?\u201dRoar!In reply to his disdain, a reverberating roar deafened the trio. They turned to see five towering trees being pushed to the ground.A fifty-meter-tall black bear appeared. Seeing its meal, the black bear roared with bared fangs and bloodthirsty eyes.\u201c4th level spiritual beast, Mad Storm Bear!\u201dZhuo Fan cried as the trio shook in fear. Xie Tianyang was even rooted in place.Before the bear could jump on its prey, a tail thick as a bucket coiled around its body. The bear was squeezed and thrown into the heavens above as its pitiful cry grew faint.When it came back down, a maw opened wide and swallowed it whole. As the maw closed, blood sprayed in the surroundings forming a pool beneath it.Even Zhuo Fan felt a shiver of fear.That was a 30-meter-long python with a scarlet crest and rock-hard scales. Its cold eyes flashed, on the prowl for the next meal.\u201c5th level spiritual beast, Diamond Crest Python!\u201d\u201cRun!\u201dZhuo Fan yelled as he sped up his crawling and the other two worked to catch up. Even Xie Tianyang disregarded his sorry state and crawled with them.He came face to face to the horrors of this area. One slip and he was a goner. It was plainly obvious why even a Radiant Stage expert would die here.When the Diamond Crest Python ate the bear, because of its bulk, it didn\u2019t notice the trio and left after its meal.\u201cDamn you, Zhuo Fan! I must\u2019ve been insane for agreeing to come with you to this hell!\u201d Xie Tianyang worked his all not only to crawl but also to complain on and on, afraid he would soon lose his life without venting.He was on the verge of tears. He had heard this place was savage, but not to this extent. If he\u2019d try to even stand taller than waist height, he\u2019d soon find danger setting its sights on him.Zhuo Fan mocked, \u201cNo one told you to come. Why don\u2019t you crawl your way back?\u201dXie Tianyang was looking at the sky.[Curses, the sun is setting. Nocturnal spiritual beasts will be on the hunt soon, and crawling won\u2019t work against them. I\u2019ll be dead in a second!][Better stick to Zhuo Fan. He would set up an array and no spiritual beast would wander in.]Annoyed, Xie Tianyang had an edge in his voice, \u201cSince I\u2019m in the same boat as you, once I wander back it will be plain suicide.\u201dZhuo Fan and Xue Ningxiang shook their heads.Then the trio\u2019s schedule was crawling by day and ducking under an array at night. And after a month they finally crawled through 3,000 miles till their limbs and waist went sore.The good news was that the closer they got, the fewer the spiritual beasts spotted. Zhuo Fan knew they entered the territory of those 6th level spiritual beasts, where no weaker beast would dare step a paw in.In the third area, 6th level spiritual beasts were kings. If they found some oblivious beastie wandering into their domain, they\u2019d chase it even for a thousand miles; all to preserve a king\u2019s dignity.Especially if humans were involved!Stretching and exhaling, Zhuo Fan felt a bit better. Despite his relaxed manner, Xie Tianyang had his eyes peeled as he cautiously rose to his feet, \u201cWe\u2026 can stand here?\u201dZhuo Fan nodded with a smile, \u201cOn our way here, there were too many eyes and ears on the lookout for any movement so we crawled to avoid the spiritual beasts. Here though is the domain of 6th level spiritual beasts. Hiding will be much more effective than crawling in this place.\u201dXie Tianyang finally found safety for the first time in a month and smiled, \u201cSo it\u2019s much safer here than other places?\u201dZhuo Fan arched an eyebrow, \u201cYou can say that, but we\u2019ll die even faster bumping into a 6th level spiritual beast!\u201dXie Tianyang\u2019s smile vanished and his tone held some bite, \u201cThen what the hell are we doing here? Tame them? How?\u201dZhuo Fan smiled with confidence.He had considered this point a long time ago. He came to such a deadly place as the third area with a plan. He only needed to slip a bloodworm into the Thunder Skylark and all was well.But the problem was how.Rumble!Zhuo Fan was cooking up a plan when a sudden noise shook the world. The trio felt the earth shaking beneath their feet.They blinked in shock.This had to be from another devastating clash of spiritual beasts. But throughout their crawling, never had they heard a sound so loud. Not even when two 5th level spiritual beasts fought.There could only be one answer\u2026\u201c6th level spiritual beasts!\u201d They shouted in unison.\u201cIt seems to be coming from that direction!\u201d Zhuo Fan ran straight for it while Xie Tianyang yelled nervously, \u201cThose beasts will tear you to pieces!\u201dZhuo Fan smirked.If one of them was the Thunder Skylark, it\u2019d be perfect. He\u2019d lay in wait and make use of the perfect opportunity to strike.Xue Ningxiang remained quiet and followed him closely. Wherever Zhuo Fan went, she would be close by. So, Xie Tianyang had no choice but to join them.Fifteen minutes later, the trio heard a thunderclap in the sky and the roaring flames.The three huddled behind a large rock in a small valley and peeked above. But the sight took their breath away.Two spiritual beasts flew high up, both 6th level spiritual beasts.One was a deep-blue colored bird with a 15-meter-long body and a wingspan of 20 meters. Lightning traveled along its body as it cracked the air.Despite being smaller in size, even compared with a 5th level spiritual beast, its every wing beat covered the sky in lightning and wind blades that struck the rocks in the valley to pieces.A 5th level spiritual beast would be crushed by such display.\u201cThunder Skylark!\u201dZhuo Fan squinted. [He didn\u2019t lie to me. Thunder Skylark\u2019s nest is here.]He then turned to the other spiritual beast.It was a flying lion wreathed in scarlet flames. Its mane was on fire and it had 30meter-long wings of flames, half as long as his body. A flap of its wings sent fire to engulf the skies and burn the whole valley to a crisp.\u201c6th level spiritual beast, Flaming Lion King!\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s heart tightened. The Flaming Lion King was as powerful as a 7th level spiritual beast, putting the Thunder Skylark at a disadvantage.He had thought that if the Thunder Skylark was tangled with another 6th level spiritual beast, he\u2019d play the fishermen and make the bird swallow a bloodworm during the confusion.Pity that it was facing Flaming Lion King. The Thunder Skylark would likely be defeated and killed! But wouldn\u2019t that bore a large hole in his plans?[No, I have to help it!][But how? This savage battle is no different than a Radiant Stage experts\u2019 fight. Getting involved will only get me killed.]Boom!As Zhuo Fan was musing a plan, the two beasts clashed again.Flaming Lion King spat a fireball while Thunder Skylark sent a thunderstorm with a flap of its wings, intending to crush it.But then, Flaming Lion King rammed its huge body into the frail Thunder Skylark.The bird cried out and tumbled around in the air.Zhuo Fan secretly sighed.Sure enough, the Thunder Skylark was just as adept at using her attribute like the Flaming Lion King, but her body lacked power in contrast.It would die if this went on.\u201cBig brother Zhuo, can you help the poor birdie?\u201d Xue Ningxiang turned her puppy eyes to him.Zhuo Fan was this close to spewing blood.[Birdie? Well, it does belong to the swallow type, but it\u2019s a spiritual beast nonetheless. Regardless, just how exactly is that thing small?]But Xue Ningxiang\u2019s pleas echoed his thoughts.[The Thunder Skylark must survive!]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 - Divine Azure FlamePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cNing\u2019er, we can\u2019t just interfere in a battle of 6th level spiritual beasts!\u201dXue Ningxiang felt regret the moment she spoke up. Over these few months, Xie Tianyang never refused any of her wishes.\u201cIgnoring the fact that our strength is not nearly enough, just from how fiercely these 6th level spiritual beasts are clashing, one can tell it is not over food, but territory. You couldn\u2019t interfere even if they were people, not knowing who is wrong or right! We can\u2019t just risk our lives for them.\u201dZhuo Fan lifted an eyebrow as he gave Xie Tianyang a deeper look.[In the end, he comes from the seven houses and knows what battles between great powers implies. If I didn\u2019t need the Thunder Skylark so badly, I wouldn\u2019t get involved either.]\u201cBut\u2026\u201dXue Ningxiang\u2019s expression was filled with worry, \u201cBut that birdie isn\u2019t fighting over territory, it\u2019s to protect her young\u2026\u201dZhuo Fan looked again and saw a nest below the Thunder Skylark holding five huge eggs.Flaming Lion King was powerful enough, but the Thunder Skylark\u2019s speed was astonishing. It could leave just like that if it wanted to, but the lion king caught it between a rock and a hard place, battering it again and again until it was filled with wounds all because it was worried about harming her eggs.Now that Zhuo Fan got the whole picture, he hatched a plan to help the Thunder Skylark.\u201cShe is one big mother.\u201d Zhuo Fan sighed, \u201cNing\u2019er, worry not. See how I get that birdie out of trouble.\u201dXue Ningxiang became overjoyed while Xie Tianyang was skeptical, \u201cHypocrite, since when were you so selfless?\u201d[This guy has a callous heart and betrays his friends at a drop of the hat. Since when did he start sticking his head out for someone else, a savage beast no less?]\u201cOh, Xie Tianyang, how can you understand me? I am in fact a man with love in his heart. Wait for a bit, I will need your help soon.\u201d\u201cScrew you! If you have love, I\u2019m a saint!\u201d Xie Tianyang retorted in derision, but then he said in shock, \u201cI got it. You want the Thunder Skylark!\u201dZhuo Fan perked an eyebrow and nodded, \u201cHa-ha-ha, you\u2019ve started using your head more since teaming up with me.\u201d\u201cCurses! I almost got used by you, again.\u201d Xie Tianyang spat, \u201cIf you want to get the Thunder Skylark, leave me out of it.\u201dZhuo Fan shrugged then gave Xue Ningxiang a long look.Xue Ningxiang nodded and showed her doe eyes as she shook Xie Tianyang\u2019s arm, \u201cBig brother Xie, go with big brother Zhuo. The birdie and her young are so pitiful!\u201dXie Tianyang felt like crying.[The birdie is pitiful? One flap from it will tear me apart. Why aren\u2019t you feeling sorry for me?]Lacking any choice in the matter, Xie Tianyang nodded. He was still feeling guilty for what happened to Xue Ningxiang and would agree to any of her requests.At his nod, Xue Ningxiang exploded into a sparkling smile and Zhuo Fan grinned at the side.\u201cZhuo Fan, watch it. If you throw me away, I will make you pay!\u201d Xie Tianyang glared but Zhuo Fan just shook his head, \u201cTake it easy, when I use someone I make sure they won\u2019t ever get the chance to come back to bite me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Xie Tianyang exclaimed.Zhuo Fan just laughed and patted his shoulder. After warning Xue Ningxiang to hide and not get discovered, Zhuo Fan and Xie Tianyang sneaked towards the eggs.The two were able to sneak thanks to the Energy Concealing Pill. As the beasts raged, lightning and flames collided, rocking the valley like a boat.Zhuo Fan and Xie Tianyang crept up cautiously below the raging storm. Each time the boom drew closer, it gripped their hearts in a vise and soaked their brows with sweat.One stray fireball or lightning could become the end for them both.Luckily enough, they reached the eggs without a scratch. Below the Thunder Skylark, it was both the most dangerous and safest place.\u201cWhat now?\u201d Xie Tianyang looked above at the flashing figures engaged in a fierce battle.Zhuo Fan explained his plan with a smile, \u201cWhile the Thunder Skylark isn\u2019t paying attention we will hide the eggs. When it finds out that its eggs are gone, it will no longer fight and rush to search for its young. Since it is faster than the lion, we will thus save its life.\u201d\u201cGood plan!\u201d Xie Tianyang spoke in a low voice and gave him a thumbs up.Zhuo Fan then indicated to lift the nest together.While the heavens were swept by a storm, two bandits were making away with the entire nest from right under everyone\u2019s noses.Seeing this, Xue Ningxiang sported a wide smile.Suddenly, Flaming Lion King gained altitude, breaking away from the bird while the Thunder Skylark kept a closer eye on its movements.As Zhuo Fan was carrying the nest, he found that the shadows on the ground were much bigger and that the sky had turned silent. Startled, he stopped and looked up.He was met with the large eyes of the Flaming Lion King. He also noticed that the lion\u2019s eyes were ridiculing him.Zhuo Fan shouted in panic, \u201cThat savage found us, run.\u201d\u201cBut the eggs\u2026\u201d Xie Tianyang was nervous.\u201cWhat eggs, just throw them.\u201dIgnoring Xie Tianyang, Zhuo Fan tossed the nest and the five eggs to the ground. Since they were spiritual beast eggs, they wouldn\u2019t break so easily.Startled by Zhuo Fan\u2019s yell, the Thunder Skylark looked in time to see her five young thrown on the ground and rushed in anger.Boom!Then, a ball of fire passed close to the Thunder Skylark. The Flaming Lion King wasn\u2019t aiming for it but the five eggs.With a cry, the Thunder Skylark flew like lightning and used her body to block the fireball.Zhuo Fan let out a mental sigh. Not for Thunder Skylark\u2019s sacrifice, but the lion\u2019s cunningness.It knew that the Thunder Skylark was fast as lightning which proved it difficult to land a heavy blow. But those eggs couldn\u2019t move and were the perfect means to cripple the Thunder Skylark\u2019s speed.Attacking what one defended was the best plan!The Flaming Lion King laughed in glee and spat another ball of flame.Thunder Skylark used her lightning to stop it but, with the eggs scattered, another ball of fire was closing in on another egg. Thus she was forced to fly all over to defend them.The Flaming Lion King, which was hovering above, roared and sneered.\u201cWe made it worse! We hastened the Thunder Skylark\u2019s end.\u201d Darting back to Xue Ningxiang, Zhuo Fan sighed. Despite not liking it, he spoke with determination, \u201cLet\u2019s go. If we wait for Thunder Skylark to die, the crazy lion will come after us.\u201dZhuo Fan and Xie Tianyang grabbed Xue Ningxiang\u2019s arm, but she stood rooted to the spot, watching the Thunder Skylark darting to and fro as tears fell down her cheeks.Zhuo Fan sighed, he had no way to help the bird now.\u201cLet it go Ning\u2019er. We need to leave!\u201d Zhuo Fan furrowed his brows and urged, but Xue Ningxiang shook her head.Boom!After fending off two dozen fireballs, the Thunder Skylark let out a mournful cry and fell tired and wounded in a large crater.The Flaming Lion King charged with its claw aiming for the bird\u2019s throat.\u201cNo!\u201dXue Ningxiang broke away from the two\u2019s grasp and rushed to defend the Thunder Skylark. The cold wind from Flaming Lion King\u2019s attack fanned her fine black hair. But her eyes remained unwavering.Zhuo Fan and Xie Tianyang rushed over, alarmed.Both forgot that they would soon be two more corpses added to the pile, that it wouldn\u2019t make a difference. Even Zhuo Fan lost his calculative mind.The three only knew to not abandon the other!\u201cNing\u2019er, I will accompany you in death!\u201d Xie Tianyang roared as he threw himself in front of her.Zhuo Fan flashed in front of the two but his eyes were fixed on the Flaming Lion King.He was the Demonic Emperor. Even in death, he would stare down his enemy.[Dumb humans, your flesh won\u2019t stop this king\u2019s claw!]The Flaming Lion King opened its mouth and sneered. As its claw drew close, its killing intent made the trio shiver.But just when the claw was about to touch Zhuo Fan\u2019s face\u2026An azure flame came out of Zhuo Fan\u2019s forehead and a shocking power shrouded the entire Allbeast Mountain Range. The spiritual beasts were left shivering and lowered their proud heads.Even those fighting bent their knees.Flaming Lion King stopped its claw and watched the swaying flame as it trembled in fear\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 - Got An EggPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe azure flame was as small as a candle\u2019s, flickering in the wind in front of Zhuo Fan\u2019s forehead.But with each sway, the Flaming Lion King\u2019s eyes shivered, as if it saw its end.It then took back its claw and sped away in the form of a ball of fire. It scampered off with speed rather than dignity, so much so that it was even close to falling at some point.A 6th level spiritual beast, a king in the Allbeast Mountain Range, was now fleeing like a kitty while trembling from every joint.Frowning, Zhuo Fan touched his forehead but the azure flame had already hidden inside.He only felt a faint warmth and concluded that it was connected to the expert who had appeared in his consciousness and touched him there.\u201cHey, Zhuo Fan,\u201d Xie Tianyang shook his arm as he questioned, \u201cB-be honest with me, are you absolutely positive that you are human?\u201d\u201cCut the crap, what else would I be, a demon?\u201d Zhuo Fan slapped Xie Tianyang\u2019s hand away.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a human scare a 6th level spiritual beast with just a look.\u201d Xie Tianyang took deep breaths to calm down and continued, \u201cDid you see how scared it was when it saw you? As if afraid you would eat it whole.\u201d\u201cAs brothers, you owe me an explanation. How many secrets are you hiding?\u201dZhuo Fan rolled his eyes then turned to Xue Ningxiang, \u201cWe were never brothers!\u201dXie Tianyang froze, then he showed an awkward smile. But he was becoming more and more curious about Zhuo Fan.Coming next to Xue Ningxiang, they saw her tear-stained face as she looked at the Thunder Skylark. The lion didn\u2019t take its life but the birdie was too far gone to be saved.Unlike Xie Tianyang, she ignored the fleeing Flaming Lion King and inspected the birdie\u2019s wounds.\u201cIt won\u2019t make it.\u201d Zhuo Fan sent his Yuan Qi to check its state then sighed.His plan on getting a Thunder Skylark went up in smoke.\u201cBig brother Zhuo, can you help her?\u201d Xue Ningxiang looked at him with teary eyes but he could only sigh.As a Demonic Emperor, he had plenty of ways, but the current him was weak.Xue Ningxiang began crying her heart out, tears falling down the Thunder Skylark\u2019s face.The bird opened its eyes and looked elsewhere.Xue Ningxiang noticed and spotted an egg not too far. But the egg was burnt black.The Thunder Skylark gave its all before but was incapable of stopping every fireball.\u201cIt wants her young. Let\u2019s go find them.\u201d Xue Ningxiang cried.Zhuo Fan and Xie Tianyang searched around and soon gathered four scorched and lifeless eggs.\u201cWasn\u2019t there one more?\u201d Xue Ningxiang nervously asked.The two shook their heads. The last one was lost. They couldn\u2019t find it anywhere.Xue Ningxiang was sorrowful, kneeling before the Thunder Skylark as she sobbed, \u201cForgive us, we are the ones who hurt you.\u201dThe Thunder Skylark was always watching the four scorched eggs with teary eyes. Then, her eyes flashed and moved her great body.From below her, the last egg rolled out. It was intact but still had a few scorch marks on it.Zhuo Fan looked long at the Thunder Skylark and secretly nodded.Despite being forced to run around by the Flaming Lion King, it knew what it had to do. It made sure to protect one egg without anyone knowing.And when it collapsed, it used its body to hide the egg. So that even if it was killed, the egg would survive. It gave its life to protect its young.Thinking about this, Zhuo Fan developed a deep respect for the bird.With a cry, the Thunder Skylark stared at Zhuo Fan or, more specifically, his forehead. Then it turned to its egg with a hopeful gaze.\u201cYou want me to take it?\u201d Zhuo Fan assumed.It nodded, eyes filled with warmth for the egg.Zhuo Fan picked it up and sighed, \u201cIt is badly burnt and, even if it hatches, it won\u2019t live for long. Unless..\u201dHe whispered the rest into the Thunder Skylark\u2019s ear. It was first startled then nodded in gratitude.Turning to her young, the Thunder Skylark closed her eyes in peace. She could now rest easy knowing Zhuo Fan would look after it.Xue Ningxiang saw its life fade away and was crying her heart out.Zhuo Fan and Xie Tianyang sighed. They didn\u2019t foresee her being so compassionate even towards a spiritual beast.They would, at most hold some respect, but never be so heartbroken about it.\u201cUh, Ning\u2019er, it won\u2019t come back. Don\u2019t feel too sad about it.\u201d Zhuo Fan consoled.\u201cYeah, I never knew you\u2019d be so compassionate towards this Thunder Skylark just after meeting it once!\u201d Xie Tianyang laughed dryly and scratched his head, not knowing how to comfort the girl.Xue Ningxiang wiped her tears and nose, \u201cY-you guys misunderstood. It is a sad birdie but I\u2019m not crying for it. I was reminded of my home. Her appearance made me recall my dad protecting me every step of the way, taking care of me\u2026 \u201cThe other two smiled dejectedly.[It seems this girl was reminiscing. No wonder she was so touched.]\u201cUh, since it\u2019s not for the bird, then I will take the Thunder Skylark\u2019s body.\u201d Zhuo Fan felt awkward as he stashed the body in his ring, but Xue Ningxiang just nodded.Xie Tianyang however, was aflame in anger, \u201cHey, why do you get to have a whole 6th level spiritual beast\u2019s body?\u201dA spiritual beast was a treasure in and of itself. The 6th level spiritual beast bodies, in particular, made for great refining materials. Even the seven houses seldom got such an item and Xie Tianyang regarded it greatly.Looking askance at him, Zhuo Fan stated, \u201cYou saw it giving me its egg. Its body is the same. You stay here with Ning\u2019er, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201dHe left before Xie Tianyang could argue. Xie Tianyang wanted to follow Zhuo Fan but seeing Ning\u2019er, he stayed. He was worried for her safety, leaving her all alone in the woods was not wise. Though it made little difference if he was there too.Whoosh!In a secluded spot, Zhuo Fan took out the egg, the Thunder Skylark\u2019s body, and some black rocks.He began circulating his Yuan Qi and his hand burned scarlet.This was a cultivator\u2019s most basic Yuan Qi flame. Weak in battle, but useful in refining. And those black rocks were spacial stones used in making storage rings.These rocks were very rare even with all the spacial rock mines in control of the seven houses and the Imperial family. But thanks to Veiled Dragon Pavilion and Imperial family endorsing the Luo clan, he got his hand on a few.And right now, he was planning on refining a beast holding ring.It was far more complex to refine than a storage ring and the great sects had a tight lock on any refining methods regarding them. Furthermore, it could even store spiritual energy.As spiritual beasts were nurtured by the spiritual energy of the world, they were the best ingredient for refining items.Case in point, this egg came from the Thunder Skylark, and its spiritual energy would help it recover. If not for this, Zhuo Fan was unsure if he could even hatch it.Now that the Thunder Skylark was dead, he desperately needed to hatch the egg and make it his demonic creature in order to enter the Lightning Canyon.For this, Zhuo Fan spoke a few words to the dying Thunder Skylark. And it agreed once it knew its broken body could help her young live.Either way, this was Zhuo Fan\u2019s way of showing his respect for the mother. Also, he would\u2019ve taken this course of action regardless of her decision.Zhuo Fan pointed and the flame towered, fusing the ingredients with high-speed hand-signs and a smile of satisfaction.He was close to fulfilling his objective.In the dead of night, stars glittered with Xue Ningxiang and Xie Tianyang watching them bored out of their mind. As this was Thunder Skylark\u2019s territory, no 6th level spiritual beast would wander here. It was the safest place for them.A sound broke the silence and Zhuo Fan appeared next to them.Xue Ningxiang ran to him in glee as Xie Tianyang looked him up and down, \u201cWhat did you do with the corpse?\u201dShrugging, Zhuo Fan was blunt, \u201cTore it in eight and used it.\u201dXue Ningxiang was startled by his reply and Xie Tianyang rushed to placate her, \u201cNing\u2019er, it\u2019s alright. The bodies of spiritual beasts are handled like this. But I don\u2019t know what he refined using it.\u201dXie Tianyang knew Zhuo Fan was an array master and an alchemist, so being a refiner on top wasn\u2019t that far fetched. As Zhuo Fan was gone for a day, he assumed Zhuo Fan had refined something.\u201cHey, did you know today is Ning\u2019er\u2019s 16th birthday? She was reminded of her family when the Thunder Skylark protected her egg and it made her cry.\u201dZhuo Fan took a long look at Xue Ningxiang, who was blushing with a lowered head.\u201cHa-ha-ha, since it\u2019s her birthday, then I will give her a present.\u201d Zhuo Fan revealed a ring that had lightning running across it. Then he took Xue Ningxiang\u2019s hand and inserted the ring on her finger.\u201cThis is the storage ring I refined from the Thunder Skylark, Thunder Ring. I have one and you the other. They both are made as one, and are connected with each other.\u201dZhuo Fan raised his hand and sparks flashed across his ring.Xue Ningxiang was overjoyed inside and blushed as she extended her fist with the ring on it. Zhuo Fan did the same with his hand and the two rings let out crackling sounds.Xie Tianyang was filled with envy and roared, \u201cZhuo Fan, g-give me one too.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m out!\u201d Zhuo Fan deadpanned, \u201cIs it your damn birthday too?\u201d\u201cNo, but you have to give me one! Or\u2026 the two of you\u2026 a pair of rings.\u201d Xie Tianyang\u2019s face burned hot. He no longer cared about the value of the Thunder Ring, but that Zhuo Fan and Xue Ningxiang wore a unique pair of rings\u2026Seeing through him, Zhuo Fan sighed inwardly, \u201cWe\u2019ve been through thick and thin together, so of course, I have one for you.\u201dZhuo Fan then tossed him a ring. Xie Tianyang put it on in glee then made a fist bump with Xue Ningxiang.Each of them got a Thunder Ring which would only react when another was around.Zhuo Fan spoke seriously, \u201cWhat gift did you give Ning\u2019er?\u201dXie Tianyang started and scratched his head from having nothing of value on him. Suddenly, he turned to the Burrowing Mouse and pointed, \u201cNing\u2019er likes playing with it, so I\u2019m giving it to her.\u201d\u201cGet lost, it has long stopped being yours.\u201d Zhuo Fan jabbed.Xie Tianyang snapped in anger, \u201cIsn\u2019t it all your doing?\u201dThe two began quarreling while Xue Ningxiang stood content at the side with a smile. Absentmindedly looking at the Thunder Ring, she wished the time would stop so that the three of them would stay worry-free.After a long night, they began their trek back first thing in the morning.But ten thousand miles out, a huge bird had its eye on each and every movement of theirs. Blue flames wreathed its body and with every flap of its wings, it flew deeper into the Allbeast Mountain Range\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then they soon arrived at the first area.With the first step into safety, their hearts started easing up. Their Thunder Rings flashed with lightning from how close they were.\u201cAll that\u2019s left is to leave Blue Expanse City and we\u2019ll be safe.\u201d Zhuo Fan looked in the city\u2019s direction with a smile.Although he didn\u2019t obtain the Thunder Skylark, he earned much more, its egg and two dear friends in life and death moments.Xue Ningxiang however was frowning, worry plaguing her heart, \u201cBut we offended the seventh elder. Won\u2019t he set a trap for us?\u201d\u201cUnlikely.\u201d Zhuo Fan stated, \u201cHe must\u2019ve spared our lives because another greater danger was looming overhead forcing him to flee. He must be thinking we\u2019ve died at the hands of that scary thing.\u201d\u201cThing, what thing?\u201d Xie Tianyang asked.Zhuo Fan only shook his head. He was out like a light at that time and was unclear what happened. But when he woke up he saw the destruction around him and came to this conclusion.As for why they were luckily spared, ask heaven!\u201cIn any case, sneaking out of the city is easy.\u201d Zhuo Fan smiled, \u201cNing\u2019er, what will you do after we leave?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dXue Ningxiang turned gloomy, but then she looked up at Zhuo Fan, \u201cBig brother Zhuo, I\u2019ll just go with you.\u201dZhuo Fan started while Xie Tianyang became flustered and said, \u201cNing\u2019er, how about you come with me, to Sword Marquise Abode. Not only will your clansmen not come for you, but even Hell Valley\u2019s people wouldn\u2019t be able to take you from us.\u201dXue Ningxiang happily nodded, \u201cAlright. Big brother Zhuo, why don\u2019t you also come? I\u2019ve never seen the strong Seven Noble Houses of the Tianyu Empire.\u201dXie Tianyang wasn\u2019t too pleased about it but since Ning\u2019er was happy he also relented, \u201cZhuo Fan, for Ning\u2019er, I will extend an invitation to visit my house as a guest.\u201dZhuo Fan looked at them for a moment and shook his head, \u201cI cannot. I have other places to be. If fortune smiles, we will see each other again.\u201dThe two were startled and hesitant about parting.Though Xie Tianyang and Zhuo Fan were like fire and water, arguing every day, they went through hell together and came out as brothers.\u201cHey, I truly welcome you to my house. Think of your brother, me, and come.\u201dZhuo Fan snickered, \u201cI already said, we aren\u2019t brothers!\u201d\u201cSigh, how can you\u2026\u201dAs Xie Tianyang was about to laugh it off, a crack was heard and a sudden pressure pushed down on them, \u201cNo one is allowed to leave!\u201dWhoosh!A black figure appeared with long black and white hair. His long goatee fluttered in the wind, and his eyes flashed as they landed on the trio.Profound Heaven expert!Zhuo Fan and Xie Tianyang were startled and protected Xue Ningxiang with their bodies.\u201cIs it an elder from Hell Valley?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never seen him.\u201dZhuo Fan and Xie Tianyang whispered. What was certain though, this old man wanted to wring them dry.But then, Xue Ningxiang jumped out from between them and walked cautiously towards the man, \u201cGrandfather!\u201dXie Tianyang was stumped while Zhuo Fan asked with a frown, \u201cYou\u2019re Xue clan\u2019s only Profound Heaven expert, Xue clan\u2019s Patriarch, Xue Dingtian?\u201dTurning a blind eye to the rotten kids in front, Xue Dingtian looked over Xue Ningxiang, \u201cNing\u2019er, where did you run off these months? I looked all over for you.\u201dXue Ningxiang hung her head in guilt and mumbled, \u201cSorry for worrying you, grandfather.\u201dXue Dingtian sighed and tousled his dear grandchild\u2019s hair then spat, \u201cDid any of these runts misbehave?\u201dXue Ningxiang knew where this was going and was embarrassed, \u201cGrandpa, what are you saying!\u201d\u201cHumph, then all is good!\u201dXue Dingtian rolled his eyes over Zhuo Fan and Xie Tianyang, \u201cWho was it that hurt my grandson, Xue Gang?\u201d\u201cHim!\u201dXie Tianyang didn\u2019t miss a beat in exposing Zhuo Fan, \u201cI only met Ning\u2019er after. I never saw your grandson.\u201dRolling his eyes, Zhuo Fan could only blame his poor luck in friends, \u201cI didn\u2019t know he was Ning\u2019er\u2019s brother, so\u2026 please forgive the offense, senior!\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 you eloped with Ning\u2019er?\u201d Xue Dingtian questioned Zhuo Fan.\u201cWhat, elope?\u201dXie Tianyang cried with a start and grabbed Zhuo Fan by the clothes, \u201cZhuo Fan, explain it to me! Since when were you so close with Ning\u2019er?\u201dXue Dingtian glanced at Xie Tianyang and turned towards his granddaughter. [Who is that kid, to be even more pissed than me?]Xue Ningxiang glared at her grandpa, then hid her flaming cheeks with her hands.[Grandpa is getting old, how could he mention something like that out of the blue?] She was complaining inside but her eyes sneaked a peek at Zhuo Fan.\u201cWait, don\u2019t misunderstand. I only asked Ning\u2019er to show me the way and nothing else!\u201dZhuo Fan gesticulated while shouting. Only then did Xie Tianyang stop.Xue Dingtian stared down Zhuo Fan but seeing no lies, he spoke, \u201cGood, in that case, I won\u2019t be hard on you on account on your time with my granddaughter.\u201d\u201cCome, Ning\u2019er, let\u2019s go home.\u201d Xue Dingtian pulled her. But Xue Ningxiang turned to the two behind her. Xie Tianyang was getting anxious, wanting to stop them.\u201cWait!\u201d Zhuo Fan shouted.Xue Dingtian spoke in a cold tone, \u201cIs there something else, runt?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t take Ning\u2019er.\u201d said Zhuo Fan with a stony expression, \u201cAnd I advise you don\u2019t return either.\u201dXue Dingtian frowned, \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be frank. We offended the seventh elder of Hell Valley and he recognized Ning\u2019er. I can guess he\u2019s now getting rowdy in the Xue clan. If you go back now, you will die.\u201dXue Dingtian was startled, then looked to see Xue Ningxiang nodding shyly.As if thunderstruck, Xue Dingtian trembled and stumbled backward before falling.Xue Ningxiang started crying and rushed to her grandpa, \u201cGrandfather, forgive me\u2026\u201dXue Dingtian tightened his fist as rage swallowed his heart. Then his killing intent filled eyes landed on Zhuo Fan and Xie Tianyang.\u201cIt\u2019s you who brought this disaster upon us. As long as I take you to the seventh elder, he will spare us.\u201dSaying so, he slapped towards Zhuo Fan.Zhuo Fan\u2019s foot moved a bit making two of his phantoms appear near him. Then they immediately retreated in different directions. Xue Dingtian scattered the three retreating figures to dust with a wave of his hand but the real one wasn\u2019t among them.The next moment, Zhuo Fan came from behind Xue Dingtian and attacked with a bloody hand.Blood Palm!Startled, Xue Dingtian felt his blood vessels boil. He now felt it on his own skin why his son and grandson had lost.Zhuo Fan wasn\u2019t only strong enough to skip stages, but also cunning and hard to fathom.Too bad he wasn\u2019t in the Profound Heaven stage like the old man.Xue Dingtian vanished before the Blood Palm could hit him, shocking Zhuo Fan.At the same instant, a powerful strike came from behind, and Zhuo Fan, who was unable to dodge in time, spat blood while flying.Xue Dingtian was about to pursue when a mystical sword intent came at him. It was Xie Tianyang wielding his Star Sword to strike Xue Dingtian\u2019s chest.As he looked at the approaching sword, the sky seemed to have calmed and he could only see the glittering sword moving.Profound ranked martial art?Xue Dingtian moved his foot slightly and disappeared, only to attack from Xie Tianyang\u2019s side with a palm.Xie Tianyang spatted blood and flew due to the impact. It was thanks to his spiritual armor that he wasn\u2019t heavily wounded.Zhuo Fan and Xie Tianyang staggered to their feet. A Profound Heaven expert\u2019s power wasn\u2019t to be taken lightly. Without an array, they had no chance.That brief exchange from before lasted but a breath and the outcome was a forgone conclusion.The two couldn\u2019t even touch a Profound Heaven expert.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, Zhuo Fan noticed the tears in the old man\u2019s eyes.Zhuo Fan laughed, \u201cHa-ha-ha, Xue Dingtian, you\u2019ve gotten senile. You think taking us to the seventh elder will save Xue clan? It will only hasten your downfall.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Xue Dingtian stopped and stared at Zhuo Fan.Sneering, Zhuo Fan turned to Xie Tianyang, \u201cDo you know who this is? He\u2019s from Sword Marquise Abode! By handing him over to the Hell Valley, you will make one of the seven houses into your enemy. Do you think you can handle their wrath and prevent the downfall of your second rate clan!\u201dXue Dingtian became apprehensive, he spoke while scrutinizing Xie Tianyang, \u201cImpossible, you are trying to play me. I would\u2019ve known by now if someone from Sword Marquise Abode came to Blue Expanse City!\u201d\u201cSeven Noble Houses\u2019 disciples wander the world, so why should they report to you? Clear those muddy eyes of yours and take a closer look at his spiritual weapon, his martial arts! Are they common? Even in the seven houses, such a masterful disciple is rare.\u201dA chill shook his very core and Xue Dingtian staggered back a few steps.He knew that was a 4th-grade spiritual weapon and the kid was using a profound ranked martial art. Who could wield both if not a man from the seven houses?Having Xue Dingtian right where he wanted, Zhuo Fan drove in the last nail with a sneer, \u201cYou want to take us back to Hell Valley when it\u2019s uncertain if they\u2019ll even accept us. But if they do, will the Sword Marquise Abode just let you go?\u201dPlop!Xue Dingtian lost all his nerve and collapsed in a shivering mess.The Xue Clan was under Hell Valley, but never would they think to step between the conflicts of the seven houses. If it ever happened, the Hell Valley would toss them in front as cannon fodder.Xue Dingtian began to feel mournful and lost.[This year is a disaster for Xue clan. Do we have no other choice but to die at the hands of one of the seven houses?]He could take these runts with him, but he wouldn\u2019t want them now even if they landed in his lap.\u201cY-young m-masters, forgive this old man\u2019s rash behavior. I was blind to young masters\u2019 identity!\u201d Xue Dingtian squeezed through clenched teeth and crouched before them to kowtow three times.Everyone was dumbfounded, while Zhuo Fan just took it all in with a critical eye.Xie Tianyang couldn\u2019t quite accept it and rushed over. Forgetting the fact he was Ning\u2019er\u2019s grandfather, just being an aged Profound Heaven expert was enough to make Xie Tianyang unable to receive such a gesture.Would the Profound Heaven experts, elders in title, back at Sword Marquise Abode had to kneel too?But Zhuo Fan\u2019s hand barred his way.\u201cIf you want to save Ning\u2019er, show off your status.\u201d Zhuo Fan whispered, to which Xie Tianyang nodded with a bit of startle.\u201cGrandfather, get up!\u201dXue Ningxiang had never seen her grandfather so humiliated and rushed to help him up. But then Zhuo Fan yelled, \u201cWho told you to get up?\u201dXue Dingtian shivered and was back on his knees with a red face.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dXue Ningxiang was angry, but Xue Dingtian pulled her back. Zhuo Fan strutted before the old man and said in a clipped tone, \u201cDo you know of our young master\u2019s eminent identity in the house? You hurt him today and us, the Sword Marquise Abode, will not let this go unpunished.\u201d\u201cYes, I was ignorant in my offense.\u201d Xue Dingtian hung his head which was already full of cold sweat.\u201cHumph, then we will take Ning\u2019er. If you want to get her back, have the Xue clan or Hell Valley come for her at Sword Marquise Abode.\u201d\u201cWait!\u201dZhuo Fan was about to leave when Xue Dingtian grabbed his ankle, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if Ning\u2019er offended the seventh elder, but she cannot leave. Or the Xue clan will be dead for good. I cannot accept it even if it means offending Sword Marquise Abode\u2019s young masters.\u201dFrowning, Zhuo Fan eyed him thoughtfully and saw the staunch resolve in his eyes.[Maybe\u2026 Ning\u2019er\u2026]Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes flashed with killing intent. He snatched Xie Tianyang\u2019s Star Sword and stabbed at the old man\u2019s chest.\u201cNo!\u201dXue Ningxiang panicked and threw herself before Xue Dingtian, stopping Zhuo Fan\u2019s attack just in time.\u201cDamnable and crazy punk!\u201dXie Tianyang came to and took his sword, \u201cI thought you were just scaring the old man, not being serious. He is Ning\u2019er\u2019s grandfather!\u201dZhuo Fan spoke coldly, \u201cIf you were to choose who dies, who will you pick among the two?\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s\u2026\u201d Xie Tianyang hesitated as he got caught in a dilemma. Xue Ningxiang didn\u2019t understand what was going on between her grandfather and Zhuo Fan.\u201cXue Dingtian, what do you need Ning\u2019er for?\u201d Zhuo Fan spoke harshly.Xue Dingtian sighed, \u201cI know that young masters like my granddaughter, but she is already betrothed to Hell Valley\u2019s young master. When she is 16 years of age, I will have to take her to them. Because of this, she has tried to run from home so many times. With how the time is nearing its end, if I don\u2019t take her, our whole clan will perish.\u201dXie Tianyang asked, \u201cNing\u2019er, is this why you ran away?\u201dXue Ningxiang nodded sadly.Zhuo Fan watched Xue Dingtian\u2019s wrinkled face for any lies but found none, \u201cSo even you do not know for sure. If it\u2019s marriage then it\u2019s fine, but\u2026\u201d\u201cBut what?\u201d Xie Tianyang snapped, \u201cNing\u2019er can\u2019t marry some random guy from Hell Valley. Come, follow brother to Sword Marquise Abode.\u201d\u201cXue Tianyang, this marriage is fake!\u201d Zhuo Fan shot him a glance then spoke to Xue Dingtian, \u201cIf it was about Hell Valley\u2019s marriage they would\u2019ve come for her ages ago. But have you seen any girl getting married off to them coming back alive?\u201dXue Dingtian pondered then shook his head, \u201cHell Valley is one of the seven houses, with proper rules and manners. Marrying with our second rate clan already deserves heartfelt gratitude. What other reason can there be? She is ready to be wed to someone, and it\u2019s no longer our place to ask.\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, that\u2019s exactly what they want.\u201d Zhuo Fan cackled, \u201cIf I were to tell you that all the girls who got married to the Hell Valley\u2019s people died, what will you do? Will you still let Ning\u2019er go?\u201d\u201cWhat? Impossible!\u201d Xue Dingtian refuted, \u201cWhy would they do that? We\u2019ve always been loyal to them.\u201d\u201cIt is because you are so devoted that they chose you to raise a cauldron!\u201d Zhuo Fan declared.Everyone asked in shock, \u201cWhat cauldron?\u201dZhuo Fan answered calmly, \u201cThere are some demonic cultivators who train in a cultivation method that utilizes ghosts of the people dying gruesome deaths. But too heavy grievance would lead to an imbalance in the yin and yang, this would increase the risk of oneself getting devoured by the ghosts. Therefore, the purest soul is needed as a foundation to train in it. And 16-year-old maidens are the best materials.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying they want Ning\u2019er to train some art?\u201d Xie Tianyang looked at Xue Ningxiang with worry.Zhuo Fan nodded, \u201cMost likely. Do you remember the seventh elder\u2019s martial art? That profound ranked martial art wasn\u2019t trained to completion and was weak because the cauldron was lacking. You think he\u2019d go easy on us on purpose?\u201dThey all gasped at the cruelty of Hell Valley which was using people as materials to practice arts.But Zhuo Fan couldn\u2019t care less. Demonic cultivators were selfish, not cruel or humane. Anything that killed one\u2019s opponent was most welcomed.He recalled that one time back in the Sacred Domain when an Emperor Stage expert cultivated this demonic method and killed ten thousand cultivators, the expert provoked the entire Sacred Domain\u2019s cultivators into an uprising against him. Even demonic cultivators rose the flag of righteousness, vowing to wipe such filth from the world.That was one of the rare occasions in which the two paths joined.Luck had it that Zhuo Fan was among them, witnessing this force on the move. He learned then not to incur public hatred if he wasn\u2019t the strongest.That was also why he trained in the dark after getting the Nine Serenities Secret Records. Even now, despite having the Demon Transformation Art, which could raise his cultivation without a limit, he wasn\u2019t slaughtering left and right.If he\u2019d get found out, he\u2019d be the next target of both paths!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If it isn\u2019t like what this young master said, then I will come back to get you and proceed with the marriage.\u201dHe ruffled her hair and flew away.Watching his departing figure, Xue Ningxiang sniffed in tears.\u201cBig brother Zhuo, will my grandfather be alright?\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s conjectures were always spot on and Xue Ningxiang wished to know her grandfather\u2019s fate.She wanted him to say her grandfather would be fine, that her clan would be fine. But Zhuo Fan shook his head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, if he doesn\u2019t return, your clan still might live for a while. But now, all of them will die.\u201dXue Ningxiang was shocked to the core and tears never stopped falling.Xie Tianyang began cursing to hide his sadness, \u201cHey, you\u2019re not that damn Insidious Demon\u2019s match in reading people, so how can you say they\u2019ll all die if he returns? I think a Profound Heaven expert would make the Insidious Demon think twice.\u201d\u201cHumph, that is where you\u2019re wrong. I may not be as sharp as him when it comes to picking up one\u2019s intentions, but we are all humans, and I can tell a thing or two of his actions. First, we offended him, and since he determined the identity of Xue Ningxiang during our fight, he would think that the Xue clan betrayed Hell Valley. He is bound to kill them to the last woman and child. But at that time, old man Xue came to find Ning\u2019er. In this case\u2026 \u201cZhuo Fan paused then sighed, \u201cUntil he knew the whereabouts of the Profound Heaven expert, he would keep them alive to draw your grandfather. Once old man Xue returns, there will be nothing holding him back.\u201d\u201cBullshit! A Profound Heaven expert is an elder in the seven houses. I don\u2019t believe he has such nerve to slaughter a Profound Heaven expert\u2019s entire clan.\u201d Xie Tianyang saw Xue Ningxiang\u2019s expression turn darker and darker and roared at Zhuo Fan.Zhuo Fan shook his head, \u201cExactly because Xue clan has a Profound Heaven expert he would wait for Xue Dingtian to return before wiping them all off. In addition, you\u2019re wrong about something. A Profound Heaven expert is not strong at all, but a free one is.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think he kneeled before us? He didn\u2019t do it for the two of us, but for the Sword Marquise Abode behind you. He didn\u2019t kneel for himself either, but for the Xue clan. If he were a rogue cultivator, free of responsibility, killing us would be a matter of fact.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Xie Tianyang wanted to retort but found nothing to refute him with. He knew of this all too well, but the sorrowful look on Xue Ningxiang pushed him to find her some solace.But Zhuo Fan\u2019s words stabbed Xue Ningxiang\u2019s frail heart like a dagger.At this point, Xie Tianyang wanted to punch him. [Can\u2019t you have some sympathy for Ning\u2019er?]\u201cAlright, stop fighting.\u201dXue Ningxiang shouted, \u201cBig brother Zhuo, I know what you said is reasonable. Tell me then, if I go back as a cauldron, can I save my clan?\u201dXie Tianyang was appalled, \u201cNing\u2019er, don\u2019t!\u201dZhuo Fan looked her in the eye but all he saw was an unwavering will and nodded, \u201cEven the magnificent and grand seventh elder of Hell Valley has no other way to train in that martial art. From this, it is obvious how much the Hell Valley lacks cauldrons. Doing this is likely to work, but\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is no but as long as it works!\u201dXue Ningxiang waved and breathed out as if to get out all the worries off her chest. She was smiling, but the two felt their hearts heavy from the tears flowing down Xue Ningxiang\u2019s cheeks.\u201cBig brother Zhuo, big brother Tianyang, thank you for taking care of me these past months. We shall part ways, just that\u2026\u201d Xue Ningxiang sniffed, \u201cI\u2019ve never once gone outside the city, never seen Sword Marquise Abode. It\u2019s my only regret.\u201dShe waved with a smile and left.Xie Tianyang\u2019s eyes were tinted red. They both knew what this girl was about to do.\u201cNing\u2019er!\u201dXie Tianyang stepped forward, but Xue Ningxiang\u2019s delicate voice reached them before he could take a second, \u201cPlease don\u2019t try to use force. I know I am not your match, but I will hate you for all my life and will never listen to you two again.\u201dXie Tianyang fell to his knees and watched her distancing figure in pain.\u201cHey, Zhuo Fan, Ning\u2019er left. Can she save Xue clan?\u201d He asked gloomily.\u201cFor some time.\u201d Zhuo Fan shook his head, his face serene, \u201cOnce Ning\u2019er\u2019s use as cauldron expires, Xue clan would\u2019ve outlived its usefulness.\u201d\u201cWhy did you let her leave then?\u201d Xie Tianyang bit his lip until he drew blood as his words were spoken with an edge.Zhuo Fan stared him in the eye, \u201cAt least\u2026 Ning\u2019er will leave this world at peace, believing her clan will be kept safe.\u201d\u201cBastard!\u201dBam!Xie Tianyang stood up and punched Zhuo Fan\u2019s face and sent him ten meters flying, \u201cYou betrayed Ning\u2019er again.\u201dRoaring, Xie Tianyang rushed after Xue Ningxiang.\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Zhuo Fan wiped the blood from his mouth and stood up.\u201cI\u2019m going to save her!\u201d Xie Tianyang was dead serious.\u201cJust you?\u201d Zhuo Fan jabbed, \u201cHow can a Bone Tempering cultivator fight against a Profound Heaven expert? You saw what happened just now. You know the difference between the Bone Tempering Stage and Profound Heaven Stage. It\u2019s not just about being unable to fly but also about speed.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201d Tightening his fists, Xie Tianyang spat, \u201cIt\u2019s better than doing nothing like you. We clearly had the chance to end that Insidious Demon last time\u2026\u201d\u201cLast time we had the element of surprise and an array in place. In an array, no matter how fast he is, we can deal with him. But how will I set an array now? Are you telling me to set one right under his nose, then ask him to kindly step inside?\u201dXie Tianyang understood the meaning behind Zhuo Fan\u2019s words but couldn\u2019t accept his manner. Ning\u2019er fought through life and death with them and now Zhuo Fan was just going to sit there and do nothing.\u201cZhuo Fan, I always knew there was no worth in trusting you. But as a man, good or bad, they are duty-bound to fulfill their promise. You promised to take Ning\u2019er out, and if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be nothing more than a coward!\u201dRoaring, Xie Tianyang sped up in his rush.\u201cIf you go you can only watch, powerless to do anything!\u201d\u201cI will still go. I would rather die than be a coward!\u201dWatching Xie Tianyang chasing Ning\u2019er, Zhuo Fan tightened his fists and muttered, \u201cWho said I\u2019m any different\u2026\u201dThen he turned around and entered the forest.In a cave, fifteen minutes later, Zhuo Fan set up a concealing array then drew an odd pattern on the ground and placed spirit stones at key locations. Then he spread Diamond Sand across the entire pattern.Finally, his hand flashed and a pair of wings with streaks of lightning across them appeared in the center of this pattern.This was a secret body refining art from the Nine Serenities Secret Records. It would make use of Demon Transformation Art to refine the ingredients and transform one\u2019s flesh into Diamond Body.This was far crueler than the Wraith Art he gave to Captain Pang. Wraith Art was a cultivation method for humans to refine their body, but this secret art treated the human body as a medium in refining it just like a demonic treasure.The results were outstanding of course, invincible and tough as steel. But the process was excruciating, a thousand times more miserable than the Wraith Art.To imagine, this process involved cutting one\u2019s body inch by painful inch if one wanted to refine his body with ingredients suited for demonic treasures. It was so dreadful that one would find death a blessing.In the past, before he even found the Nine Serenities Secret Records, Zhuo Fan wouldn\u2019t train in Wraith Art even if he had it. Because it was too inhuman, too brutal, despite how much strength it gave back.And here he was using a method even more excruciating and dangerous.But this was also the only way he could improve his strength in a short time. If he wasn\u2019t stronger than that cunning and deceitful Insidious Demon, his success wasn\u2019t certain!With his heart at peace, his eyes filled with resolve, Zhuo Fan made a hand sign.In an instant, the strange pattern shined brightly and started to churn. As it spun, the Diamond Sand trickled towards a small vortex in the center and entered inside the cross-legged body of Zhuo Fan\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 - Spirit and Body RefiningPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySpeck by diamond speck sunk into Zhuo Fan\u2019s body as the array turned. The sand acted like minute needles boring through his muscles and drawing blood.All Diamond Sand that touched him pierced his body, with no exception. One or two specks, he could bear, but a hundred, a thousand\u2026 they were beginning to take its toll on him and all this while he could only gnash his teeth.When the number reached millions, his whole body was soaked in blood. And this blood all came from pin-sized holes left behind by the diamond speck, akin to a very fine sieve.Looking closely, the Diamond Sand had ruined his muscles, turning them to mush.And this was only the beginning, yet the pain was so excruciating, worse than any torture; death by a thousand cuts, quite literally.However, to speed up his increase in power, Zhuo Fan still bore through it with clenched teeth, unwilling to utter even a grunt. Fine sweat ran over his body, testament to the pain. Even the mighty Demonic Emperor was reduced to a shivering mess.\u201cAHH!\u201dThen, Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes narrowed as he cried out, unable to endure another million specks piercing his skin and muscles.He yelled and howled from the pain, but knew he had to stop and soon closed his mouth shut.In his heart he knew, this body refining method would remake his entire body, from the inside out, replacing his all with Diamond Sand. So much so he would become an unbreakable diamond.But before that, he would have to endure this agony.Yet this was just the flesh, it would soon be followed by the bones and inner organs.Zhuo Fan could only grit his teeth and follow through. If not for wishing to save Xue Ningxiang, he wouldn\u2019t have chosen this path no matter how amazing the result!Too cruel!The strange array never stopped revolving, feeding Zhuo Fan\u2019s body with Diamond Sand. After two long hours, his muscles were broken down to the last fragment, then the Diamond Sand continued on to pierce his bones.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dZhuo Fan shook from the pain and a grunt escaped his clenched teeth.Yelling would only amplify his suffering until he could take it no more. To avoid his demise, he forced his mouth shut while his eyes bulged out of his blanched face.[Damn rotten decrepit senile Nine Serenities Emperor. How the hell did you come up with this insane refining method?]The moment the Diamond Sand entered his bones, Zhuo Fan spasmed. He couldn\u2019t even speak, so he cursed the first Demon Emperor of ages past in his mind.Had the Demon Emperor heard, his reply would be mockery, \u201cDid I push your hand? Who lied to you that a meager thing like you can succeed?\u201dSuddenly Zhuo Fan\u2019s body seized up one second and laid limp the next. His skeleton was turned to dust in that instant.Such pain filled his eyes with tears, but he was now nothing more than a pile of mush. And all he could do was lie paralyzed on the ground.[There\u2019s also the last step\u2026 body remodeling\u2026]Zhuo Fan was sweating bullets as he sucked in a deep breath through gritted teeth.With his skeleton nothing more than a bone meal, the Diamond Sand burrowed deep into his organs. It didn\u2019t wait to stick to them like before but punched right through them.Zhuo Fan\u2019s organs were shredded and he was spewing blood mixed with flesh again and again.The blood seeped into the strange array and fused with it. Yet despite the constant flow of blood and the sweat and the pain, his lips curled into a sinister grin.[I have prevailed. Now only body remodeling is left\u2026]Zhuo Fan\u2019s smile was wiped away by a wail.\u201cAHHH!\u201dIt didn\u2019t go as planned. The Diamond Sand finished with his organs and went for his brain.Be it a mortal or cultivator, the brain was the weakest for both, as it was the place that housed one\u2019s soul.Diamond Sand was raining havoc in his very soul, his mind. Once it was gone, his death would be final.He felt as if thousands of ghosts were assailing him, a pain down to the bottom of his core. It was thousands of times crueler than the first step. But unlike before, when his mind was clear, the pain was now eating away at his consciousness.His soul was slowly being spent and was on the verge of shattering. And all he could do was wait for his demise.\u201cHa-ha-ha, for me, the grand Demonic Emperor, to die at my own hands! How ironic! If only I knew how wretched this body refining method was\u2026\u201dZhuo Fan chastised himself as he grew weaker.All this while, the strange array never stopped spinning, and the remaining Diamond Sand on it was soaked in his blood, but he was too far gone to even care. He was hanging by a thread, one that thinned by the second.What struck him as odd was, why did he have to refine his body through this hellish torture?\u201cI must\u2019ve gone insane. Why did I use this deviant secret art\u2026\u201dZhuo Fan shut his eyes with a trace of regret, as his life flashed before his eyes.Since he became a demonic cultivator, he overcame all trials baring his path, becoming the leader of the Eight Emperors in the Sacred Domain, the first below a Saint; a path filled with glory. Then he gained the Nine Serenities Secret Records, bringing him further joy, and though his disciple sold him out, he was reborn in the Luo clan, as a steward. Then he met Xie Tianyang and Xue Ningxiang\u2026\u201cXue Ningxiang\u2026 Xue Ningxiang\u2026\u201d Zhuo Fan\u2019s lips cracked open, muttering her name in his delirium. Then he flashed his eyes open and yelled, \u201cNing\u2019er!\u201dHe recalled why he chose this path. It was to save her.At that moment, the strange array spun faster and faster, encompassing everything in it in arcane power.Zhuo Fan\u2019s forehead released a blue flame that turned into tendrils and enveloped his body, to ultimately fuse into the strange array.Zhuo Fan had no clue that this secret body refining method didn\u2019t just refine the body, but one\u2019s spirit too. Its purpose was to unearth all potential of a cultivator.If only the body was refined through this method, failure was guaranteed and death was a certainty.When Zhuo Fan was nearing death, he woke up to the reason behind his choice and his will to live thrummed with power. It resonated with his soul and allowed the blue flame in his body to fuse with the array.It was only now that this strange array displayed its true power.The array spun so fast that it kicked up a storm. It soon turned blue from the flame and melted the Diamond Sand before fusing it with Zhuo Fan\u2019s blood, flowing throughout his body.Golden blood soothed Zhuo Fan\u2019s lacerated body, breathing life into his muscles, bones, and organs. The blue flame returned to his forehead once the process was complete and fused with his soul.Zhuo Fan kept his eyes closed, unaware of what happened outside. He only felt his life renewing and growing with every passing moment.All this time, Blood Infant sat cross-legged in his Dantian. Seeing the incoming golden blood, it was filled with ecstasy, swallowing as much as it could.It began to alternate between fading in and out of reality, to ultimately turn into a golden infant. It opened its eyes and they flashed golden, filled with vigor.Thanks to the blue flame, the pair of wings which streaked with lightning, were turned into liquid and entered Zhuo Fan. In a blink, an image of a pair of blue wings appeared on his back with lightning flashing across them.Deep in the Allbeast Mountain Range, high up a mountain, laid a cave. And from this cave came the shocked voice of a strong middle-aged man.\u201cEh? How come the azure flame I gave the kid is now gone? Did he remove it, or did he take control over it?\u201dThen laughter came from deep within the cave, \u201cHa-ha-ha, I must be getting old. For that kid to erase it is already impossible, so how could he refine it? Not even a Saint Stage expert can receive my azure flame.\u201d\u201cAlthough, if he really removed it, how will I find him? Well, he\u2019ll come around sooner or later, ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201dThe man laughed in his cave, and the sound traveled for hundreds of miles, but there was no spiritual beast around to hear it\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 - Diamond BodyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBlue Expanse City, Xue clan\u2019s entrance.When Xue Dingtian landed, he noticed that the place was eerily quiet. There weren\u2019t even guards around, it made his heart nervous and he rushed inside.He soon arrived outside the main hall. As he looked inside, he saw a familiar figure in the seat of honor, Hell Valley\u2019s seventh elder, You Guiqi.The seventh elder was leisurely nursing a cup of tea.\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware the seventh elder graced us with his presence. Please forgive me for not welcoming you!\u201dThe seventh elder\u2019s presence here intimidated Xue Dingtian but he forced himself to show proper respect as if all was normal in the world.You Guiqi sipped his tea then smashed it on the table.Plop!And Xue Dingtian\u2019s heart sank with it.Giving him a cursory glance, You Guiqi broke out in an insidious grin, \u201cXue Dingtian, you\u2019ve been under Hell Valley\u2019s care for a century now. We\u2019ve always been kind to you.\u201d\u201cWithout a doubt! Thanks to Hell Valley and seventh elder assisting us, Xue clan reached today\u2019s glory!\u201d Xue Dingtian forced his anxiety down, hiding it behind a smile.You Guiqi nodded and stood up. He strolled before Xue Dingtian and patted his shoulder with a warm smile.\u201cIt\u2019s great that you think so, then\u2026\u201dAs he spoke, You Guiqi\u2019s face twisted and clawed at Xue Dingtian\u2019s shoulder as he thundered, \u201cWhy did you collude with outsiders and steal Hell Valley\u2019s Diamond Sand?\u201dXue Dingtian was shaking in fear and fell on his knees to kowtow, \u201cSeventh elder! This is a misunderstanding! The Xue clan has been nothing but loyal to Hell Valley. We would never do such a thing!\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, there was a time I thought the same, that you wouldn\u2019t be taking advantage of our kindness then move behind our backs. But that time has long passed!\u201dGrunting, You Guiqi slapped the table to splinters and barked, \u201cWhere is your grandchild, Xue Ningxiang?\u201dXue Dingtian stammered for a response, but words left him.\u201cHumph, I will tell you. She and two runts stole my Diamond Sand and they now lie dead in Allbeast Mountain Range.\u201d You Guiqi\u2019s brow shook as he recalled the dreadful howl he heard at that time. If he had stayed a moment longer, he\u2019d be a goner.Despite not finishing the trio off, he assumed the monster would\u2019ve finished the job with how wounded they were.He thought ruefully about this event. Xue Ningxiang was of use to him, but now she was gone. He came back empty-handed too, no Diamond Sand and neither a cauldron.Sighing, You Guiqi placed his rage on the Xue clan.\u201cMen, bring them in!\u201d You Guiqi clapped and three Bone Tempering experts pulled three people in chains.Xue Dingtian was filled with sorrow and tears fell as he looked at them.They were Xue Wanlong and his sons, Xue Gang and Xue Lin. Heavy hooks dug deep into their shoulders, locking their clavicles in place and sealing their cultivation. From the bruises and wounds all over their bodies, it was clear how close they were to breathing their last.\u201cSeventh elder!\u201dXue Dingtian bellowed and stared down the smirking You Guiqi with bloodshot eyes, \u201cXue clan sacrificed its all this past century for Hell Valley in defending Blue Expanse City. Is this how Hell Valley repays its vassal clan\u2019s hard work?\u201d\u201cHe-he-he, your second rate clan is nothing but garbage. Hell Valley can have as many as it wants. To me, you\u2019re no vassals, but somewhat useful watchdogs.\u201d\u201cWe throw you a bone, a reward, and you should be skipping around in joy. When a dog starts raising questions to his master about getting credit for its hard work, it must be put down!\u201d You Guiqi cackled.Unable to bear You Guiqi\u2019s mockery any further, Xue Dingtian clenched his fist and unleashed his fury.Exerting his pressure as a Profound Heaven expert, he pushed back the three Bone Tempering experts around him while You Guiqi just watched on with naked killing intent.\u201cIt seems that the watchdog wants to take a bite out of its master, he-he-he\u2026 Then it\u2019s time to replace it!\u201d\u201cYou Guiqi!\u201dIn his entire life, this was the first time Xue Dingtian uttered the seventh elder\u2019s taboo name out of sheer rage, \u201cLet me ask you. Isn\u2019t Ning\u2019er\u2019s marriage just a cover to use her as a cauldron and practice martial arts?\u201dYou Guiqi looked at him in surprise before laughing, \u201cHa-ha-ha, I used to look down on you every time, but look at how smart you are. We\u2019ve been at it for so long yet you\u2019re the only vassal clan that figured it out. So that\u2019s why you defected, it\u2019s all for a silly girl!\u201d\u201cBastard!\u201dXue Dingtian\u2019s fury exploded and rushed with his entire Yuan Qi laid bare, \u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201dYou Guiqi sneered, sidestepping Xue Dingtian\u2019s palm and delivering an attack of his own.Bam!The hit on his chest upset his blood flow and Xue Dingtian spat blood as he tumbled backward.You Guiqi made use of Xue Dingtian\u2019s prone condition and delivered two more palm attacks.Xue Dingtian felt his chest burning and he spurted blood like a fountain.\u201cHa-ha-ha, Xue Dingtian, you think you have what it takes to kill me? You\u2019re nothing but a greenhorn Profound Heaven Stage cultivator that just broke through, while I am in the 3rd layer. You are at the bottom and I am at the peak. You will never overcome this chasm!\u201dYou Guiqi then dealt another palm attack with bloodthirsty eyes, \u201cOld coot, die! But go in peace knowing that your son and grandsons will follow you!\u201dPowerless to do anything, Xue Dingtian closed his eyes awaiting the final strike. Such an ending, he never wished for his Xue clan. But at the very least, his dear granddaughter escaped this calamity.Xue Dingtian was relieved that You Guiqi assumed her to be dead and wouldn\u2019t search for her\u2026\u201cStop!\u201dA high pitched cry was heard and You Guiqi stopped his attack midway. Looking ahead, he saw Xue Ningxiang at the gate, holding a dagger to her neck.\u201cYou\u2019re alive?\u201d You Guiqi was in shock. His sole reason for coming to this clan was to have her as a cauldron.Xue Ningxiang took in the sight of her suffering family, her grandfather beaten to a pulp, and her eyes teared. She only had hatred towards You Guiqi for his cruelty.Dagger inching at her throat, Xue Ningxiang threatened, \u201cIf you still want me as a cauldron, release them! Or I will take my life right here and now!\u201dYou Guiqi mocked, \u201cHe-he-he, Ning\u2019er, get off your high horse. We do need you to practice martial arts, but you aren\u2019t irreplaceable. You have nothing to bargain with.\u201dXue Ningxiang was startled and worry gnawed her heart, but she recalled Zhuo Fan\u2019s analysis and showed her white neck as she mocked, \u201cSeventh elder, you can\u2019t lie to me. I know Hell Valley lacks cauldrons, I know of my value. Since you do not care, then I will die along with my family.\u201dXue Ningxiang then traced her dagger along her neck and blood trickled.\u201cNing\u2019er, no!\u201d\u201cStop!\u201dXue Dingtian and You Guiqi cried at once. Xue Ningxiang looked down on You Guiqi, \u201cSeventh elder, it seems to me that you\u2019re not yet ready to let me go!\u201dYou Guiqi\u2019s ruthless eyes flashed, \u201cIs that runt still alive?\u201dXue Ningxiang avoided his gaze. She knew who he was talking about, \u201cHe died in Allbeast Mountain Range and you can go look for his body if you want to. But I\u2019m afraid spiritual beasts would\u2019ve devoured it by now.\u201d\u201cHumph, don\u2019t try to lie to me!\u201d You Guiqi\u2019s sneered, \u201cI have many enemies, but that runt was the first to bring me to such a state\u2014coming back empty-handed and heavily wounded.\u201dChuckling, You Guiqi continued, \u201cGirlie, don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but you do not have what it takes to see through me. That runt must\u2019ve told you.\u201dXue Ningxiang only stared back, to which You Guiqi shook his head, \u201cIn any case, I will have to take a step back. Since you put me on the spot, I will not take your family\u2019s lives.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Xue Ningxiang was about to go help her grandfather in joy, but You Guiqi shook his hand and a hook bit into Xue Dingtian!\u201cAh!\u201dA wail of agony resounded and Xue Dingtian blacked out. His chest was soaked in blood and his clavicle was pierced, just like his son\u2019s.\u201cYou Guiqi, you\u2026\u201d\u201cI said I won\u2019t kill them, but your grandfather is a Profound Heaven expert. I have to make sure he falls in line. I will, of course, let them go once we\u2019re at Hell Valley.\u201d\u201cYou better honor your word!\u201d Xue Ningxiang stared at him.Nodding, You Guiqi snickered, \u201cHow could I lie when you\u2019re so valuable!\u201d\u201cMen, take miss Ning\u2019er to rest, we will return to Hell Valley on the morrow!\u201dAn elegant youth arrived next to Xue Ningxiang along with two servants. Zhuo Fan would\u2019ve recognized him in an instant. He was You Ming, who infiltrated Blackwind Mountain as Yang Ming and later escaped Windgaze City.Standing next to Xue Ningxiang, You Ming snickered, \u201cSo you are the cauldron for my seniors\u2019 use? I have to say, you sure are pretty.\u201dXue Ningxiang snorted and turned to look at her family as she left accompanied by the servants.You Ming shrugged then went to You Guiqi, \u201cMaster, what would you like us to do in regards to Luo clan? We have suffered greatly at the hands of their steward, Zhuo Fan!\u201dXue Ningxiang\u2019s pace faltered at the name.\u201cDid you tell anyone else that he killed two of our elders?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d You Ming was cautious, \u201cEven if I do, no one would believe me.\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, I didn\u2019t believe it either. But a few months back, I met a freak of nature that countered everything I threw at him. With how large the world is, there are bound to be some monsters out there.\u201d\u201cMaster, then\u2026\u201d You Ming spoke softly.Shaking his head, You Guiqi\u2019s eyes flashed with killing intent, \u201cWe will deal with this runt first, then think of a way to end that Zhuo Fan. Or these two whelps will one day be Hell Valley\u2019s nightmare.\u201dXue Ningxiang was worried sick at his words and picked up the pace.She was worried since You Guiqi had set his eyes on Zhuo Fan because of her. Yet none of them knew that the two whelps were one and the same\u2026The night seemed endless to Xue Ningxiang as her heart was unable to find peace.At dawn, the first rays of sunlight washed over the unusually quiet Xue clan\u2019s small courtyard. A dozen servants were already tending to Xue Ningxiang\u2019s preparations.Meanwhile, a shockwave passed through the first area of Allbeast Mountain Range and exposed a pitch-black cave.A naked man staggered outside in the gentle sunlight, giving his body a golden shine.His every step left deep prints in the earth, and even the rock crumbled to dust.He sheltered his eyes from the sunlight and looked around. He took another step and rested his hand on the cave wall for support.But his small action destroyed the stone wall completely and he fell to the ground.The man stood up among the rubble, however, the rock he was on also turned to dust.Taking a moment to adapt, his face now showed resolve. At a closer look, it was clear this man was Zhuo Fan.Just that his every line and features were as if sculpted, exuding sharp power. When he opened his eyes, streaks of lightning sparked.Zhuo Fan got a feel of his body and revealed a manic grin. Everywhere he touched let out a metallic sound.He was immensely pleased with his body, which was now completely refined with the Diamond Sand and was as tough as a 5th-grade spiritual weapon.He then touched his forehead and a blue flame drifted out.This was the flame that the mysterious expert gifted. He couldn\u2019t control it until now. But through the strange array\u2019s refining, it fused with his soul and became his Soul Flame. He could now use it any way he wished.Thinking of this made him burst out in laughter.The refining process was hellish, excruciating, and deadly, but the result was astounding. He was now reborn with an unbreakable Diamond Body. Even a Profound Heaven expert wouldn\u2019t be able to make a dent in his body.With but a thought, a pair of wings with lightning flickering over their surface, burst from his back and lifted him ten meters in the air.They were the wings of Thunder Skylark, a creature who\u2019s speed was incredible even against a Profound Heaven expert. This was why he chose to refine them into his body.With them, he became a freak, a true monster!Putting on new clothes, he flashed towards the Blue Expanse City like lightning\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The entire Blue Expanse City gathered around to witness the event.You Guiqi and You Ming sported a faint smile.Everyone was happy towards Hell Valley\u2019s show of gratitude. Some people were even tearing, imagining it was their family\u2019s daughter getting married.Xue Ningxiang walked before the shocked masses. If before they were amazed by Hell Valley\u2019s power, now they were in awe by her beauty.Xue Ningxiang was dressed in a common wedding gown but lacked the heavy makeup other brides had. Yet solely from this, her appearance evoked a feeling of genuine beauty, not a fake one from excess preparations. Pure as an orchid, making people afraid of marring!Only this beauty deserved to be married into the seven houses!The crowd gathered to see her smile, to wish her blessings.But their best wishes and kind thoughts only worked to burden Xue Ningxiang\u2019s already heavy heart.Everyone here envied her second rate clan for their marriage with one of the seven houses, unaware of the hell that awaited her.Slanting her head towards You Guiqi, Xue Ningxiang asked in a cold tone, \u201cWill seventh elder accompany me?\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, but of course. It is my duty to protect miss Ning\u2019er and Hell Valley\u2019s disciple\u2019s wedding, to safely deliver you to Hell Valley.\u201dThe crowd was once again in awe of their kindness.However, Xue Ningxiang only showed a smile of disdain, [What safeguard, it\u2019s clearly for monitoring us.][At least once You Guiqi leaves Blue Expanse City, big brother Zhuo can escape.]Before she could breathe easy, You Guiqi saw through her and said with a cold smile, \u201cOh right, miss Ning\u2019er, I sealed off Allbeast Mountain Range, even your secret tunnel. Those rats won\u2019t be able to escape from my palm.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dXue Ningxiang flared as her face blanched. It was her clan\u2019s secret and You Guiqi must have pulled it out from her father and brothers.Zhuo Fan\u2019s means of escape was now cut off.\u201cSeventh elder, I want\u2026\u201d\u201cNo need to say it!\u201d You Guiqi cut her off with a cold smile, \u201cYour life was exchanged for your family, nothing more nothing less.\u201d\u201cMiss Ning\u2019er, after you!\u201d He then shook his sleeve.A lavish palanquin was before her with fifty Bone Tempering experts around it.Xue Ningxiang frowned as she lifted her leg only to put it back down. She wanted to save Zhuo Fan but You Guiqi had her family\u2019s lives in his hand. She had nothing to bargain with.Suddenly, Xue Ningxiang\u2019s Thunder Ring flashed and her heart seized in panic.\u201cDon\u2019t come!\u201d Xue Ningxiang shouted at the sky, startling the onlookers.No one except You Guiqi understood the reason behind her reaction. With a sinister flash in his eyes, he patiently waited for his prey.\u201cNing\u2019er, I have come to save you!\u201dIn response to Xue Ningxiang\u2019s shout came another. It was Xie Tianyang piercing forward with Star Sword at You Guiqi.Sword intent made the crowd gasp as they scattered.You Guiqi just mocked, \u201cHumph, so you want to die. A mere Bone Tempering cultivator would find their death close at hand against me!\u201dYou Guiqi, unafraid of the 4th-grade spiritual weapon, struck back with a palm.Against the wind pressure of the palm, Xie Tianyang\u2019s sword tip trembled and the sword intent scattered.He was shocked but didn\u2019t use the sword to defend and added more power to it.A golden sword light flew from the sword tip and pierced the mighty palm, then it continued towards You Guiqi.\u201cSpace Rupturing Form!\u201dYou Guiqi\u2019s heart tightened and he vanished from his spot. The sword light struck the palanquin and turned it into splinters.\u201cSword Marquise Abode\u2019s profound ranked martial art, Flowing Space\u2019s Nine Forms?\u201dYou Guiqi appeared behind Xie Tianyang and spoke with derision, \u201cYou\u2019re from Sword Marquise Abode. How can a boy wield its legacy? Are you\u2026 \u201d\u201cHumph, none of your business!\u201dXie Tianyang snorted and stabbed backward.This time, the sword no longer had the imposing might. But everywhere it struck, it made space stagnate and You Guiqi was slowed.\u201cEmpty Net!\u201d Xie Tianyang bellowed.\u201cHumph, you don\u2019t know when to quit! Even with a profound ranked martial art, the gulch between Bone Tempering Stage and Profound Heaven Stage cannot be overcome.\u201dSnorting, You Guiqi vanished, only to appear in front of Xie Tianyang.Xie Tianyang was startled but could do nothing as You Guiqi\u2019s palm slapped him into the air. When he landed, six Bone Tempering experts surrounded him to make sure he didn\u2019t get up.\u201cHumph, disgraceful runt! If not for Sword Marquise Abode, you would\u2019ve died by now!\u201d You Guiqi mocked him.Xie Tianyang spat on his face and responded as if to spite him, \u201cI dare you to kill me! But can you take responsibility for the war that follows? Ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201dWiping his face, You Guiqi\u2019s tone turned colder with killing intent, \u201cDamn kid, you think I\u2019m scared? You made a mess in my city, so the Sword Marquise Abode won\u2019t say anything even if I kill you.\u201dYou Guiqi slapped at Xie Tianyang\u2019s chest.Xue Ningxiang cried, \u201cNo!\u201d But You Guiqi was dead set on killing him.\u201cStop!\u201dAn aged voice echoed and a golden sword wave hacked down!You Guiqi wasn\u2019t about to receive it. This attack was unlike Xie Tianyang\u2019s, it was backed by the power of a Profound Heaven expert.He stopped his attack and jumped six meters back.Boom!When the dust cleared, a meter wide hole was in You Guiqi\u2019s previous position; its depth unknown.A white-haired old man drifted next to Xie Tianyang and fanned the Bone Tempering experts away.\u201cEighth elder!\u201dThe old man looked frail, his eyes cloudy, a stark contrast to the true expert he was. Even his right hand was missing three fingers, yet this hand was bony and showed its blue veins clearly. Proof he was a seasoned swordsman.Xie Tianyang cried in joy while You Guiqi sneered, \u201cJian Suifeng, fifty years no see. How have you been?\u201d\u201cFine, until you came to ruin my mood!\u201d\u00a0 The elder spat through gritted teeth. His cloudy eyes seethed with bone-deep hatred.\u201cEighth elder, thank god you\u2019re here. Help me save Ning\u2019er!\u201d Xue Ningxiang pulled Jian Suifeng\u2019s sleeve.But Jian Suifeng shook his head, \u201cTianyang, this is Hell Valley\u2019s affair. We cannot get involved.\u201d\u201cYoungster, there\u2019ll be hell to pay if you poke your nose in other\u2019s business.\u201d You Guiqi snickered, then turned to Jian Suifeng, \u201cCase in point, you lost your three fingers due to the same reason.\u201dJian Suifeng\u2019s eyes trembled from rage as he stared You Guiqi down, \u201cYou think I would\u2019ve fallen for your scheme if not for being young at that time?\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, it would\u2019ve been better if you had stayed quiet!\u201dYou Ming laughed, \u201cI heard from my Master about senior\u2019s matter, of the so-called undistinguished elder with rotten youth. At that time, if senior hadn\u2019t lusted over a girl from one of Hell Valley\u2019s vassal clans, why would you force your way in her town, only to finally end with you ransomed by your glorious Abode Lord with three cities? Too bad about those three fingers; you had to leave those behind.\u201dGritting his teeth, Jian Suifeng was so enraged that veins popped, \u201cYou Guiqi, don\u2019t take it too far.\u201d\u201cOr what, you\u2019ll attack?\u201d You Guiqi made a sinister grin, \u201cFive decades ago you couldn\u2019t beat me. And that hasn\u2019t changed even now, when we\u2019re just one layer apart. You best run along and call for your seventh elder instead.\u201dHe continued to ridicule Jian Suifeng, \u201cI am in awe of the Sword Marquise Abode\u2019s 13 sword elders fame shaking the empire. But you\u2019re the only eyesore among them, not worth a dime!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Jian Suifeng clenched his fists and shouted, \u201cTianyang, we\u2019re leaving!\u201d\u201cBut eighth elder, you must at least fight for the honor of Sword Marquise Abode even if we can\u2019t save Ning\u2019er. Leaving like this\u2026\u201d\u201cQuiet! Can\u2019t you tell he\u2019s goading us? This here is Hell Valley\u2019s domain. Winning or losing here will put Sword Marquise Abode at a disadvantage.\u201dHe glared once more at You Guiqi and said to Xie Tianyang, \u201cTianyang, remember You Guiqi\u2019s title and how cunning he is. Next time you meet him, make sure to face him with ample preparation.\u201dXie Tianyang looked at Xue Ningxiang not far ahead, and said in a determined tone, \u201cI know that. But if I don\u2019t save her today, I will regret it for the rest of my life.\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, such is youth, ignorant of the world\u2019s dangers! Since Sword Marquise Abode\u2019s young master is so entertained by the idea of a hero saving a damsel, I will oblige by giving you a chance. Save not only her but also her clan, letting her feel ultimate gratitude towards you.\u201dYou Guiqi clapped and four Bone Tempering experts pulled four large crosses, with the entire Xue clan nailed on them, from old to young.\u201cGrandpa, dad, brothers!\u201dXue Ningxiang wailed and glared at You Guiqi, \u201cSeventh elder, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cActing my role as a villain.\u201dYou Guiqi then sent a grin towards Xie Tianyang, \u201cHow will the young master play the hero otherwise?\u201dHe then twisted his face and howled, \u201cAttack!\u201dThe Bone Tempering experts took out hooks and clawed them into the Xue clan\u2019s members.Blood fell like rain and their howls rang in the air. They even found the strength to shout their lungs out when the hooks came out of their bodies. Not even Xue Dingtian, who was a Profound Heaven expert, was eased from this suffering.Xue Ningxiang was crying her heart out and yelled, \u201cYou Guiqi, stop or I will kill myself!\u201d\u201cThen I will kill them all.\u201d You Guiqi roared in return.Xue Ningxiang was rooted to the spot, powerless to alleviate the painful cries of her family. Her knees softened and she collapsed, as did her mind.Snickering next to her ear, You Ming reveled in her pain, \u201cGirlie, get off your high horse. You\u2019re in no position to demand anything from my Master. He is Insidious Demon, the number one sage of Hell Valley. So many people from the seven houses have fallen to my Master\u2019s ploys, and you think you can best him at that?\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, I\u2019ll have you know this too. It\u2019s because you angered him that he chose this course of action. You might have a bargaining chip, but too bad, you\u2019re too naive. And don\u2019t forget he has a bargaining chip too, rather close at hand.\u201dXue Ningxiang lifted her head but all they conveyed was emptiness and tears.Despair and agony!She sacrificed herself to save her clan, but she was far from being able to win against this cunning fox. It instead earned his ire and now he was venting it all on her clan.\u201cIt\u2019s all my fault!\u201d She blamed herself for everything.\u201cWho will save me now?\u201d Xue Ningxiang mumbled while looking at the sky in tears, \u201cWho can save us?\u201d\u201cHumph, idiot!\u201d You Ming mocked her but then shrugged, \u201cIdiot or not, a cauldron still has its use.\u201dXie Tianyang saw Xue Ningxiang losing herself and his heart was in pain. Jian Suifeng stopped him from charging over with a shake of his head and a hand on his shoulder.\u201cThe farther we are from You Guiqi, the better.\u201d\u201cBut eighth elder\u2026\u201d Xie Tianyang\u2019s words faltered as Jian Suifeng\u2019s hand squeezed his shoulder harder, afraid the kid would make a rash decision.Plop!Xie Tianyang collapsed to his knees, his spirit broken, his pride as a genius turned to nothing but tears of humiliation. The girl he liked was suffering before him and he was powerless to do anything.Then he suddenly recalled Zhuo Fan\u2019s words.[If you go you can only watch, powerless to do anything!]It all went out just as Zhuo Fan had said. Xie Tianyang believed there was nothing he couldn\u2019t do, but now he realized how meager and weak he was.\u201cIt seems that I was the coward all along!\u201d He muttered under his breath.\u201cZhuo Fan, you bastard, where the hell are you?\u201d Xie Tianyang then raved through his manly tears and punched the ground until his fist inflamed.Jian Suifeng understood the kid\u2019s pain but couldn\u2019t help him.Suddenly, Xue Ningxiang\u2019s and Xie Tianyang\u2019s rings sparked. Only this time it was much stronger, similar to the time when the three Thunder Rings were close together.\u201cHe\u2019s here!\u201d Xie Tianyang looked around with hope.Xue Ningxiang shivered and her eyes began to regain clarity. She muttered looking at the Thunder Ring, \u201cB-big brother Zhuo\u2026\u201dRumble!Suddenly lightning streaked across the sunny sky. It struck down among the crucified Xue clan members and blasted out the Bone Tempering experts there in all directions.The dust rose as lightning still flickered within and everyone was now trying to perceive through it.When the dust settled, it revealed Zhuo Fan sporting his manic grin.\u201cYou Guiqi, I lost the previous round. But the second round starts now!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 - Terrifying PowerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWho is he?\u201dAsked Jian Suifeng when he saw Zhuo Fan through the dust while being shocked by the feeling of dread the youth exuded.He was experienced enough to notice that Zhuo Fan had just entered the Bone Tempering Stage, and yet the aura and power the kid released held a threat to a Profound Heaven expert\u2019s life.This contradiction made it all feel bizarre.Xie Tianyang felt the same. Zhuo Fan\u2019s face, which was radiating golden, added an extra feeling of pressure.It was unlike that from a Profound Heaven expert but felt like raw power was seeping in Zhuo Fan and threatened to destroy his last vestige of life.Everyone felt as if they were standing in front of a savage beast that was ready to pounce on them.\u201cHe is a friend most untrustworthy, but also most dependable!\u201d Xie Tianyang smiled wryly as his body shivered. Not from fear, but excitement.He grasped the possibility that this new Zhuo Fan could save Xue Ningxiang.Jian Suifeng looked at Xie Tianyang in amazement.It was his first time seeing this arrogant and genius kid show such confidence and dependence on someone.Jian Suifeng turned to watch Zhuo Fan, to witness what made him so special.\u201cHa-ha-ha, you not only survived but broke through!\u201dYou Guiqi sensed Zhuo Fan\u2019s entirely changed aura but dismissed it. The way he saw it, this was merely confidence from entering a new realm.[He would learn on his own skin how weak a Bone Tempering cultivator was in the face of a Profound Heaven expert, and his confidence will deflate like a balloon.]One thing did strike him as odd though. He and Zhuo Fan last met a few months ago when the kid was in his 6th layer of Qi Condensation, and on his last breath. Yet here he was less than half a year later, unharmed and even advanced to Bone Tempering Stage.His speed sent shivers even down You Guiqi\u2019s spine.[How did this happen?] You Guiqi thought, [This runt is a freak, and must definitely be put down for good!]You Guiqi snorted, \u201cMing\u2019er, go and end him for me.\u201dZhuo Fan rose an eyebrow in ridicule, \u201cOh, so it\u2019s you. That\u2019s fine, last time you ran away and left me with regret, but I will be extra careful in making sure to end our grievance this time around!\u201d\u201cWhat, you two know each other?\u201dYou Guiqi jerked back at You Ming, only to see his prideful disciple shaking in his boots. Even his face was twisted, pale beyond belief.\u201cUseless! Even with me having your back, you\u2019re still this scared?\u201d You Guiqi spat at his disciple\u2019s cowardice.It was fine if no one else was around, but with the two from Sword Marquise Abode here, it made quite the embarrassment.[A damn lily-livered punk threw all of Hell Valley\u2019s name into the ground.]Jian Suifeng wasn\u2019t one to overlook the chance to laugh at their expense, \u201cHa-ha-ha, a brilliant disciple matching a renowned master. Today I\u2019ve seen Hell Valley\u2019s disciple\u2019s staunch will!\u201dYou Guiqi was turning green and kicked You Ming who faceplanted into the ground, \u201cWhat a disgrace. He just broke through, while you\u2019re in the 2nd layer of Bone Tempering Stage!\u201dStumbling to his feet, You Ming took a short glance at Zhuo Fan. But Zhuo Fan\u2019s wicked grin seemed to spell death and so he threw himself at You Guiqi\u2019s feet with a wail, \u201cMaster, h-he is Luo clan\u2019s steward, Zhuo Fan! Elder Jian and Elder Yun died because of him!\u201dYou Guiqi froze a second then flitted a long look at Zhuo Fan.He finally seemed to understand.Zhuo Fan\u2019s power wasn\u2019t limited to setting up 5th-grade arrays. He also had a cunning mind that almost made him pay with his life. [It\u2019s no wonder the two elders died by his hand.]In Hell Valley, elders were seen as figures of respect and worshiped by disciples, unrivaled in the world. But You Ming witnessed the death of two and now fear gnawed his heart like a demon.He will never muster the courage to face Zhuo Fan in this life regardless of his advantage over him.With You Ming in the 2nd layer of Bone Tempering Stage, he should have no trouble dealing with the newly advanced Zhuo Fan. But was this notion still valid? Just look at him shivering!You Guiqi sighed and patted You Ming\u2019s shoulder.To remove his disciple\u2019s heart demon, his disciple had to kill Zhuo Fan himself.He stated coldly, \u201cAnyone willing to capture him will receive my reward!\u201d\u201cElder, I will do it.\u201dA large man cupped his hands. He was in the 6th layer of the Bone Tempering Stage. Dealing with an early Bone Tempering cultivator was easy pickings.The other guards were sad that they missed such a chance. Zhuo Fan was an easy contribution that just flew away.You Guiqi nodded and turned You Ming\u2019s head towards Zhuo Fan, \u201cMing\u2019er, watch. This runt is only good with arrays. Now that he has no chance of setting one, he\u2019s done for. The guard will soon bring him over and you can kill him yourself to remove your heart demon!\u201dYou Ming nodded and looked ahead.Jian Suifeng frowned, \u201cYou Guiqi sure lives up to his title. He instantly figured out his disciple\u2019s state and a way to help him overcome it. Tianyang, your friend is in danger.\u201dXie Tianyang looked at the always composed Zhuo Fan and smiled, \u201cThat punk never batted an eyelid. He will be fine.\u201dSuch a reply rose Jian Suifeng\u2019s curiosity.[The difference between the two is of 5 layers, so the outcome should be clear as day.]The large man thundered towards Zhuo Fan with a cackle, \u201cHe-he-he, you are a heaven-sent gift for me. I can\u2019t wait to receive my reward from the seventh elder once I hand you over.\u201d\u201cPeople die from greed, while birds die from hunger. It all depends on you if you can defeat me.\u201d Zhuo Fan snickered.\u201cHa-ha-ha, you sure have a big mouth for one who is about to die. One fist is enough to make you behave.\u201dThe large man\u2019s punch was as fast as the wind and as strong as a mountain!Yet Zhuo Fan didn\u2019t look like he had time to react.The boom shook in everyone\u2019s ears.Xie Tianyang\u2019s smile was gone, now replaced with shock that Zhuo Fan wasn\u2019t even able to dodge.[He was able to contend equally with me when he was a Qi Condensation cultivator, so why didn\u2019t he move?]Xue Ningxiang\u2019s face fell, \u201cBig brother Zhuo!\u201dSeeing that Zhuo Fan took the punch head-on, Hell Valley\u2019s guards started sneering.\u201cHe-he-he, I knew he was done for, but never thought it\u2019d be over so quickly.\u201d\u201cDid he really kill two of our elders? If he did then I am first under heaven, ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201d\u201cCurses, that moron got all the reward. Now I want to know what Valley Lord\u2019s gift will be!\u201d\u2026As the people started chattering, Zhuo Fan\u2019s threatening atmosphere soon disappeared from their hearts.Only You Guiqi frowned, looking left and right.\u201cAh!\u201dA wail pierced the noise of the crowd, and the large man was seen clutching his hand as he stumbled back.His hand was now a twisted and broken mess.Turning to Zhuo Fan, nothing seemed to have changed about him, still the same grin and the same demeanor.\u201cThis is impossible!\u201dJian Suifeng cried, \u201cA 1st layer Bone Tempering cultivator broke a 6th layer\u2019s hand with his face?\u201dXie Tianyang\u2019s eyes bulged out. He knew Zhuo Fan always moved with a plan in mind, but even he found this new strength of this youth borderline perverse.[With him like this, he\u2019ll have no trouble even against Profound Heaven experts!]The crowd now lost their mocking gazes and were instead rooted in place by fear and shock.Zhuo Fan never paid them any heed as he strolled before the large man. The large man was groaning while holding his bleeding hand.Before he could react, his chest was then punched through by Zhuo Fan\u2019s fist. It all seemed so easy, as if he punched through paper.Zhuo Fan then flicked his hand and the large man splashed on the ground after a wide trail in the sky.The people watched in abject horror the bulging eyes of the man, his vacant expression.[Where did this kid come from? His power is obscene\u2026]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 - Human WeaponPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYes, obscene!This was the only apt description anyone could think of. Zhuo Fan\u2019s power far exceeded the common understanding and only this word could encompass the height he reached.It was common knowledge that Bone Tempering Stage was the best period in a cultivator\u2019s life to temper one\u2019s body. Even a Profound Heaven expert could, at best, destroy a Bone Tempering cultivator\u2019s organs. A far cry from what Zhuo Fan did, running one through.On top of that, Zhuo Fan just broke through, making this even unprecedented throughout history.\u201cMonster!\u201dIt first began as a whisper, but this word grated everyone\u2019s ears and they all agreed to this adequate assessment.Fear was painted vividly on their faces.Hell Valley\u2019s Bone Tempering guards were no longer envious of the \u2018lucky\u2019 man, instead, they felt sympathy for him.[What rotten luck! Not only didn\u2019t he earn merit but threw his life away instead.]Whoosh!Zhuo Fan was suddenly caught off guard by a white and black pair of chains as they coiled around him.You Guiqi smirked, holding the other end of the chains.\u201cDamn, even with the kid\u2019s insane talent, he\u2019ll be mincemeat soon as he is locked by the 4th-grade demonic treasure.\u201d Jian Suifeng sighed.He was in awe of Zhuo Fan\u2019s ability, of his bright future, but\u2026 [A pity he\u2019ll die at Insidious Demon\u2019s hand.]Xie Tianyang\u2019s heart tensed. He didn\u2019t foresee a Profound Heaven expert like You Guiqi resorting to sneak attacks on a newly promoted Bone Tempering cultivator.Although the person in question was a freak of nature, it was still despicable.Xue Ningxiang was happy at first but then turned worried.Zhuo Fan eyed the familiar demonic treasure and said, \u201cUsing such underhanded moves from the get-go, that too against a junior. Seventh elder, seems like you do not care about Hell Valley\u2019s name.\u201dYou Guiqi laughed dryly, \u201cYou\u2019re smart to notice my intention from a look. There is hardly anyone compared to your caliber in the Tianyu Empire. You are one outstanding devil that not even I dare to neglect.\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, I truly admire the seventh elder\u2019s cautious nature. In any case, this junior came without any plan or scheme prepared, only to end you myself. Yet you\u2019re so prudent regardless.\u201dYou Guiqi\u2019s mood darkened.Reading between the lines, he knew Zhuo Fan mocked him for his yellow-bellied attitude. Even he had his limits, especially when humiliated in front of such a crowd by a Bone Tempering junior.\u201cRunt, say that again and I\u2019ll make sure there won\u2019t even be a corpse left of you.\u201d\u201cAm I wrong?\u201dZhuo Fan cocked his head and laughed, \u201cWith your character, the faster you kill your opponent the better. Yet the first thing you did when I arrived was to send your disciple to test the waters, only to have him reduced to a shivering mess from fear to the point he ignored your orders. And left with no choice, you sent that buffoon to his death in the name of curing your disciple\u2019s heart demon.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to even mention winning, but just in case he failed, it wasn\u2019t that much of a loss since it offered you the perfect timing to blindside me when I finished him off. And this is the result!\u201dZhuo Fan enlightened everyone and even Jian Suifeng was startled so much that his fear for You Guiqi grew.He wasn\u2019t You Guiqi\u2019s match and if he were in Zhuo Fan\u2019s stead, You Guiqi would\u2019ve succeeded in his devious plan.[You Guiqi is ruthless and cunning to the extreme. Yet that Zhuo Fan isn\u2019t any better, discovering his ploy in an instant.]The Insidious Demon showing such an extreme caution against a Bone Tempering cultivator not only shocked him but everyone present.On the other hand, Zhuo Fan wasn\u2019t in the least beneath You Guiqi in cunningness.Thinking about this let Jian Suifeng hold Zhuo Fan in higher regard.\u201cHi-hi-hi, aren\u2019t you caught in my web despite seeing through it?\u201d You Guiqi snickered with killing intent, \u201cI just need to twitch my arm and you\u2019ll turn putty!\u201dZhuo Fan rose an eyebrow and laughed, \u201cSay, how did a sinister old coot like you turn so stupid? You think it\u2019s that easy to trap me since I saw through you?\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s eyes gleamed and lightning cracked.Bam!You Guiqi couldn\u2019t even react before the chains were thrown away.Zhuo Fan now sported a pair of ten-meter long wings streaked by flashing lightning!\u201cThunder Skylark\u2019s wings?\u201d Xie Tianyang cried.Zhuo Fan had appropriated the Thunder Skylark\u2019s body for himself. But Xie Tianyang didn\u2019t expect him to refine its wings into a demonic treasure.Since the Thunder Skylark was a 6th level spiritual beast, adding the Diamond Sand into the equation, the refined demonic treasure would also be 6th-grade.Xie Tianyang was in glee. [No wonder this punk barged right in here, he had such an awesome item. This will increase his chances of victory against You Guiqi greatly.]\u201c6th-grade flying demonic treasure?\u201d You Guiqi\u2019s tone was grave, \u201cWith it, you can match a Profound Heaven expert\u2019s speed, however\u2026\u201dAs he spoke, he flicked the Yin-Yang Chains. The chains moved individually from opposite directions to seal Zhuo Fan\u2019s escape.\u201c\u2026A Profound Heaven expert\u2019s advantage over Bone Tempering cultivator isn\u2019t just limited to speed.\u201d\u201cI know that all too well!\u201d Zhuo Fan didn\u2019t care about the chains, \u201cA Profound Heaven expert relies on his quick moves in melee, not something a flying demonic treasure can overcome. Although\u2026\u201dBut then, the chains were about to strike Zhuo Fan, one aiming his head and the other his chest.Whoosh!The pair of wings moved like independent arms and swatted the chains away.You Guiqi and Jian Suifeng jerked in shock, \u201cThis can\u2019t be possible!\u201dThere was an ancient story that spoke of flying demonic treasures that could change shape at the wielder\u2019s will and launch attacks. But a demonic treasure was inanimate, so how could it do that?The people there watched Zhuo Fan as if they were looking at a monster. He sported a faint smile as he spoke at leisure, \u201cBut when did I say it\u2019s a demonic treasure?\u201dWhile demonic treasures were refined as tools, Zhuo Fan refined the wings into his body.In other words, they were part of his body. He could let them out at will and make them move as he wished.He was no longer your average human being, but a human weapon. If the wings were a 6th-grade demonic treasure then his body had become a 5th-grade demonic treasure refined through the method of Diamond Sand tempering!This wasn\u2019t something You Guiqi and the rest could fathom when not even the denizens of Sacred Domain couldn\u2019t.The only ones who could comprehend this were those ancient talents who held the Nine Serenities Secret Records and were aware of the deviant secret method to refine materials into their human body.\u201cDamn freak!\u201d Even the calm You Guiqi had to curse through gritted teeth. His eyes were bloodshot and his hands were poised to strike.The two chains flitted everywhere and soon became two, then four, then eight\u2026 Numerous chains approached from every angle like a rain of death, all aiming for Zhuo Fan.He wanted to beat Zhuo Fan to a pulp.But Zhuo Fan smiled fearlessly as he stood his ground. His eyes flashed and the wings moved like lightning.Only the sounds of cracking lightning and grating metal were heard, while not even a trace of the chains nor the wings was seen.But the flickering lightning was proof enough for everyone to know of the bitter fight the two were in.This was a Profound Heaven expert\u2019s speed.This gave a shock to the audience and let them know how weak they were against a Profound Heaven expert. But Zhuo Fan was the one who agitated them the most.A Bone Tempering cultivator had such power\u2026Xie Tianyang watched numbly with incredulous eyes at how deep the gap between them was. Even more so when Zhuo Fan of yesterday was a far cry from today.\u201cEighth elder, what can you see?\u201dXie Tianyang saw Jian Suifeng standing there in a daze without blinking. He never saw his elder so astonished in his life.\u201cYou Guiqi is pushing hard with his attacks but Zhuo Fan is blocking them all. It is unclear as to the outcome, but You Guiqi seems to have the upper hand!\u201d Jian Suifeng stated so, but his eyes never left the fight, afraid of missing anything.Xie Tianyang was despondent. His and Zhuo Fan\u2019s gap was now even bigger.Zhuo Fan of before won with arrays while now he relied only on himself.In merely a single day, their positions switched so much that Xie Tianyang was left far behind in the dust\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhuo Fan\u2019s expression was one of focus as he halted his wings while You Guiqi was nowhere in sight.A sound broke the silence and Zhuo Fan\u2019s heart seized, he instinctively bent his wings.Ding!His wings blocked the sneak attack of the chains from behind but a cold needle was speeding at his back.It was You Guiqi with his 3rd-grade demonic treasure, Twisted Needle!\u201cHe-he-he, runt, what are you going to do now?\u201d You Guiqi snickered.Zhuo Fan\u2019s wings were occupied with the Yin Yang Chains. The 3rd-grade demonic treasure\u2019s attack came at an impeccable timing, right when Zhuo Fan\u2019s movement was sealed.Not even You Guiqi could get out of this one if he was in Zhuo Fan\u2019s place.But Zhuo Fan only muttered, \u201cMystifying Phantom Step!\u201dWhoosh!He vanished from his place and the chains along with the Twisted Needle lost their target, throwing You Guiqi off-balance.Then Zhuo Fan came from behind using his wings as axes aiming for You Guiqi\u2019s neck.Ding!With a crisp sound, the wings and Yin Yang Chains clashed again. But this time, their roles were reversed.The situation flipped in a blink, with Zhuo Fan now pressing his advantage!Even Jian Suifeng was affected by this sudden turn. Hell Valley\u2019s number one sage, You Guiqi, was driven to a corner by a youth.\u201cSeventh elder, how does it feel to be on the receiving end of a sneak attack?\u201d Zhuo Fan\u2019s wings pushed against the Yin Yang Chains until You Guiqi leaned backward, \u201cIf I also had a 3rd-grade demonic treasure, you\u2019d be dead by now. Yet despite your efforts and the golden opportunity, I\u2019m still alive and kicking, so to speak.\u201dYou Guiqi\u2019s face flushed and was gasping heavily to ease the rage within him.Zhuo Fan\u2019s words were an affront to his title.You Guiqi wasn\u2019t powerful because of his cultivation, but because of his title as Insidious Demon, the number one sage of Hell Valley.Yet Zhuo Fan was mocking his pride. The same as saying [If I were you, I would\u2019ve long killed my opponent with a sneak attack and wouldn\u2019t need to waste time chatting them up!]This was the worst humiliation You Guiqi ever suffered.One may mock his character, his devious nature, yet he would take them all as badges of honor. But never ever would he allow one to insult his intelligence. That was where he drew the line.Anyone who mocked him for a fool, he would make sure to give them a fate worse than death.Yet Zhuo Fan had him beaten at every corner and kept mocking him, with him powerless to prevent it. This brought a never felt feeling of resentment.\u201cDon\u2019t get too cocky, damn runt!\u201dYou Guiqi\u2019s anger reached a breaking point. His Yuan Qi exploded, flinging Zhuo Fan\u2019s wings aside.Then, he swirled his chains at Zhuo Fan leaving behind afterimages.You Guiqi was at peak speed and with the added effect of the Yin Yang Chains, he reached a new height.Zhuo Fan remained calm as he laughed. His figure darted around with the help of Mystifying Phantom Step and his wings, moving even faster than You Guiqi.The people were once again bearing witness to afterimages and metallic sounds clashing with streaks of lightning, but never a clear image of any of the two\u2019s bitter fight.They flashed across the entire plaza, one moment to the east, the next to the west. Flashing in every direction possible and even around the Bone Tempering guards.But since the people could only hear them and not see, they stood there in fear. One slip, one errant move from their part and only pieces would remain of them.\u201cEighth elder, how does it look?\u201dWhen You Guiqi and Zhuo Fan were at a standstill with demonic treasures, Xie Tianyang could grasp some of the situation. But as the matter devolved to such a state, he was unable to see them and had to defer to Jian Suifeng\u2019s assessment.Jian Suifeng however gestured for Xie Tianyang\u2019s silence as he focused his all on the fight.After one huge boom, two figures reappeared.Zhuo Fan crossed his hands casually, standing in the same spot, while You Guiqi was gasping for breath. Zhuo Fan\u2019s nonchalant attitude left not only him but also Jian Suifeng, in shock.\u201cW-who won?\u201d Xie Tianyang knew but still couldn\u2019t help ask.Jian Suifeng was solemn, \u201cSoon you will know.\u201dThunderous booms echoed and a score of Bone Tempering guards were struck down by lightning. It burst their heads and liquefied their organs.The other guards fled for fifty meters in anxiety while You Guiqi and Zhuo Fan stood across each other, having known of this long ago.\u201cW-what\u2019s happening?\u201d Xie Tianyang darted his eyes to the corpses in fear.Jian Suifeng\u2019s eyes never left\u00a0 Zhuo Fan as he spoke in a grave tone, \u201cTianyang, your friend is terrifying. I\u2019ve never seen anyone like him. That You Guiqi, he has never suffered as much as he has now.\u201dXie Tianyang didn\u2019t understand, but Jian Suifeng continued, \u201cIn their clashes, You Guiqi was giving his all. They attacked each other again and again and made me believe Zhuo Fan was also fighting with everything. Then suddenly, his speed jumped. But\u2026\u201d\u201cBut what?\u201d Xie Tianyang seemed impatient.Jian Suifeng revealed an imperceptible smile, \u201cBut instead of ending this battle, he dragged You Guiqi around, killing guards right under You Guiqi\u2019s eyes.\u201dXie Tianyang was startled, \u201cWhy do this? Why didn\u2019t he finish the old man off if he had the chance?\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, this is where the kid is truly terrifying.\u201dJian Suifeng\u2019s eyes shook and he turned serious, \u201cHe did it to mock that old fool. An elder was led by the nose by a snot-nosed brat, killing a score of his men yet powerless to stop it. You Guiqi, known as the Insidious Demon, was played around by a Bone Tempering kid as a cat plays with a mouse. Will there be any pride left in him after this?\u201d\u201cZhuo Fan and You Guiqi are the same. Offending such a person would invite a world of suffering. Because their revenge isn\u2019t limited to killing you, but robbing you of all you hold dear, including pride. Death only comes after there is nothing left to plunder.\u201dJian Suifeng suddenly laughed, feeling all his grievances get washed away, \u201cOnly evil can fight evil! You Guiqi was despicable in his ways for too long, and today he met his match in a little demon who has a heart just as black as his! How refreshing!\u201dJian Suifeng\u2019s laughter rang in everyone\u2019s ears and jarred You Guiqi\u2019s. The later was burning with rage and was close to spewing blood. He felt miserable every time he saw Zhuo Fan standing smug.Zhuo Fan\u2019s power exceeded his predictions by far.In the first move itself, he discovered that Zhuo Fan had surpassed him. He not only treated this fight as a spar but also had the leisure to kill his men.Zhuo Fan left him powerless. Especially when it came to schemes, where Zhuo Fan was at his level, if not higher.You Guiqi felt his head hurt, feeling weak and feeble for the first time.[No, this can\u2019t end like this! If this gets dragged on for long, he will kill me. I need to end it in one blow!] You Guiqi had a plan in mind but didn\u2019t know if it would work, especially in Zhuo Fan\u2019s case. But he was left with no choice.His eyes flashed and flung the chains at Zhuo Fan.\u201cThis thing won\u2019t work on me.\u201d Zhuo Fan smirked, readying his wings.But the Yin Yang Chains veered off from him at the last minute, aiming for Xue Ningxiang.Xue Ningxiang was rooted in fear, but Zhuo Fan appeared before her in a flash of lightning and flung the chains with his wings.\u201cHa-ha-ha, I see it now!\u201dYou Guiqi laughed hysterically, \u201cZhuo Fan, oh Zhuo Fan, I found your weakness. In the Allbeast Mountain Range, you ingrained a deep fear in these old bones with your constant attacks, so I thought you came this time seeking revenge. But now I see it was all for her.\u201d\u201cAnd you think this changes anything? You will die just as well.\u201d Zhuo Fan stated.\u201cHumph, if you bore the same ruthlessness you showed before, I would have some misgivings. But you care for this girl and placed victory in my grasp, ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 - Instant KillPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYou Guiqi jumped in the air and performed a double hand sign.A demonic face appeared, twisted in malice and pain.\u201cHell Valley\u2019s profound ranked martial art, Demonic Face Seal!\u201d Jian Suifeng shouted, \u201cThis martial art is focused on striking at one\u2019s soul, it is undefendable. Even Radiant Stage cultivators will find it hard to cope with such an attack. The lightest injury is dizziness, while the worse would be death.\u201dHis words traveled to Zhuo Fan\u2019s ears as a clear warning.You Guiqi noticed this but laughed instead, \u201cDamn runt, if you dodge, the Demonic Face Seal will kill the girl. If you try to take her, you won\u2019t make it!\u201d\u201cBig brother Zhuo, forget about me and leave. I can die in peace knowing you will save my family.\u201d Xue Ningxiang urged.Zhuo Fan looked back with a smile, then spoke coldly at You Guiqi, \u201cShe is mine. As long as I\u2019m here, you can\u2019t harm her.\u201d\u201cThen I will kill you, ha-ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201dYou Guiqi pointed and the demonic face wailed on its way towards Zhuo Fan. Xue Ningxiang was nervous and was about to jump in front, but Zhuo Fan stopped her with his wing.Boom!The demonic face smashed on Zhuo Fan and thousands of gray tendrils of energy wrapped around him. The cries of lamentation, similar to that of a being starved for centuries and finally finding food, were heard all around.Xie Tianyang turned towards Jian Suifeng in anxiety, but the latter only sighed.Even a Profound Heaven expert was powerless in the face of such an attack, least of all a Bone Tempering cultivator.Xue Ningxiang couldn\u2019t hold back her tears.\u201cHi-hi-hi, damn runt, lust is your downfall. A demonic cultivator should be ruthless, yet you let emotion cloud your judgment and make you weak.\u201d You Guiqi cackled as he turned to Xue Ningxiang, \u201cWench, his death is on you.\u201dXue Ningxiang watched Zhuo Fan become gray and her cries became heartrending.If not for saving her, he could\u2019ve lived.\u201cBig brother Zhuo, forgive me, it\u2019s all my fault!\u201d Xue Ningxiang sobbed.\u201cHa-ha-ha, foolish girl, don\u2019t let that old goat see you cry. You\u2019re only bringing him satisfaction!\u201dSuddenly, Zhuo Fan\u2019s voice came from within the ball of gray tendrils. The crowd was shocked.[Wasn\u2019t Zhuo Fan wreaked with pain inside there, how is he so calm?]You Guiqi cried in fear, \u201cThis isn\u2019t possible! His soul should have been swallowed whole!\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, you want to kill me with a parlor trick? Aren\u2019t you a tad bit naive, Insidious Demon?\u201dAn azure flame flashed from within the gray tendrils. The gray energy retreated every time the flame moved.As the gray energy withdrew, Zhuo Fan was soon revealed before the crowd with an azure light coming from his forehead.Zhuo Fan muttered, \u201cDemon Transformation Art!\u201dSuddenly, the gray energy wailed as they were devoured by the azure flame. And Zhuo Fan felt his soul growing stronger as result.Demon Transformation Art was originally used to absorb everything to promote one\u2019s cultivation. The reason he couldn\u2019t absorb souls so far was because his own wasn\u2019t strong enough. It would only be a detriment if the result would\u2019ve harmed him instead.But since he refined his soul, it grew in power, akin to Radiant Stage cultivator\u2019s level. And having the strange azure flame as a protector, this measly amount of vengeful ghosts were nothing more than a snack after the flame removed the waste.Eying You Guiqi in the air, Zhuo Fan mocked, \u201cIs that it? If you have no trick up your sleeve, guess I\u2019ll have to get serious.\u201d\u201cGet serious? He-he-he, stop showing off. Are you saying you\u2019ve been playing around all this time?\u201dYou Guiqi was both angry and startled. Startled that Zhuo Fan could dismiss such a strong attack and angry from his contempt.But that was how Zhuo Fan treated him, with naked contempt.Wasn\u2019t he Insidious Demon of Hell Valley, their number one sage?Despite all that, fear grew inside him. This was a foreign feeling to him since he always grasped his opponent\u2019s weakness before striking them down.But when he looked at Zhuo Fan, he only felt powerless despite everything he threw at the kid. Furthermore, he had a nagging feeling that all his moves were within Zhuo Fan\u2019s calculations.Zhuo Fan played him like a fiddle, leaving him without a shred of dignity. This fear he had was the worst he ever felt.Chuckling, Zhuo Fan mocked again, \u201cSeventh elder, I wonder, do you remember what you told me a few months back in the Allbeast Mountain Range? Against true power, all schemes are moot.\u201dYou Guiqi\u2019s eyes dilated, his heart sped up, and a bad feeling crept its way down his spine.\u201cToday, I throw this line right back at you!\u201dGrinning, Zhuo Fan pointed at the sky, \u201cIn just one move, I will have your head.\u201d\u201cBullshit!\u201dYou Guiqi could no longer take it and snapped.He now realized, Zhuo Fan\u2019s end goal this time was revenge against him while he was only saving Xue Ningxiang in passing.From the moment Zhuo Fan showed up, he smacked the old man\u2019s face at every corner, to show him how useless his Insidious Demon moniker was before true power.[My intelligence is laughable when it comes face-to-face with raw power. My cunningness falls short to his.]Zhuo Fan wanted to crush his pride as an insidious person, to die in pain.\u201cWhat a dreadful kid, far worse than even You Guiqi!\u201d Jian Suifeng felt overwhelmed with shock.[He is even more terrifying than Zhuge Changfeng.]This thought helped Jian Suifeng understand Zhuo Fan\u2019s actions so far. [It is unknown if he will one day be friend or foe. Observing him now is for the best!]Ignoring the gazes around him, Zhuo Fan stared down You Guiqi with delight in his eyes.Perhaps all demonic cultivators were at their happiest in the throes of slaughter.Zhuo Fan laughed, \u201cYou Guiqi, ready? It\u2019s time you see what real power looks like.\u201dHe jumped the next moment.Bam!He shot for You Guiqi like a rocket.You Guiqi attacked with his Yin Yang Chains. But with a flap of his wings, Zhuo Fan slipped right past them.Yin Yang Chains couldn\u2019t even touch him and he was already punching at You Guiqi.\u201cHa-ha-ha, got you!\u201dYou Guiqi laughed and a black and white chain flew at Zhuo Fan\u2019s chest. But Zhuo Fan only said, \u201cOh, so you had another set of chains besides those two!\u201d\u201cBut so what? With my power, all your plans are moot, including all you\u2019ve hidden so far!\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s eyes flashed and a golden light flew from his body. It was the Blood Infant after being refined with Diamond Sand.The Blood Infant, which was comparable to a 5th-grade demonic treasure, charged at the black and white chain.The chains couldn\u2019t last even a second as Blood Infant tore through it along with You Guiqi\u2019s arm.You Guiqi was shocked to find that the golden light, which passed by his ear, had taken away not only the chain but also his arm.He only now woke up to the validity of Zhuo Fan\u2019s previous words, so much so that Blood Infant\u2019s power scared You Guiqi.He had no time to feel the loss of his arm when Zhuo Fan\u2019s punch was right at his face.\u201cDamn runt, you think you can kill me in one move?\u201dHe knew his death was sealed, but he wasn\u2019t about to let Zhuo Fan determine how he died.Or he really would never rest in the afterlife. The only reason he still fought was for his honor.Whoosh!3rd-grade demonic treasure Twisted Needle flew from his sleeve towards Zhuo Fan\u2019s fist.As long as he stopped the fist, he wouldn\u2019t die in one blow. Such was the glorious mind of the number one sage in Hell Valley reduced to after fighting with an equally insidious demon.Zhuo Fan was here to make sure he would be left without a scrap of honor.The punch still moved without hesitation, meeting with the Twisted Needle, to the joy and hope of You Guiqi.But the crisp sound that resulted from the contact revealed that the Twisted Needle broke in two. The fist was unaffected in the slightest as it bore into You Guiqi\u2019s chest.You Guiqi watched in horror and muttered, \u201cW-what kind of damn monster are you?\u201d\u201cHumph, I don\u2019t mind telling you. My body is as strong as a 5th-grade demonic treasure. Yours was only a 3rd-grade demonic treasure! And as for why I\u2019m such a freak\u2026\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s eyes flashed as he recalled the endless anguish and torment he had to live through, \u201cIsn\u2019t it all your fault?\u201dRoaring, Zhuo Fan threw his fist and flung You Guiqi into the ground, smashing a few buildings.Blood flew from You Guiqi\u2019s mouth as he watched Zhuo Fan in the air with shock and loss.[How does your freakish change have anything to do with me?]With this final thought, You Guiqi\u2019s head sagged and breathed his last. His eyes were wide open, never to find peace\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In his hand, he was clutching a still-beating heart which was dripping blood.But the owner of this heart had long met his end and was no more than a stiff corpse, never again able to find peace from the horrors he endured.The onlookers raised their heads in shock but witnessing the majesty of Zhuo Fan, they even forgot to breathe. Fear was almost palpable among the Hell Valley\u2019s guards.In just a single blow, the notorious Insidious Demon, the number one sage of Hell Valley, You Guiqi died.Xie Tianyang was in denial of what he witnessed, even Jian Suifeng was swept by fear as he gazed upon the youth hovering in the sky.\u201cA true monster!\u201d Jian Suifeng muttered.Zhuo Fan simply relaxed his grip and the heart dropped down to the ground with a splat.But this casual action seized everyone\u2019s hearts.As Zhuo Fan\u2019s cold stare roamed among the people, they lowered their heads in fear; horrified that the demon would set his gaze on them.Zhuo Fan, however, only laughed, \u201cThat guy must\u2019ve run off to his house. He actually slipped away again.\u201dHe suddenly swooped down, alarming the people into scattering. But he went by Xue Ningxiang and held her.Xue Ningxiang let out a short cry before being carried into the clouds. They both then disappeared in a lightning flash.In a clearing outside Blue Expanse City, lightning sparked, revealing Xue Ningxiang and Zhuo Fan landing. As he eased her onto the ground, she looked at him in puzzlement.Zhuo Fan had a faint smile, \u201cI said that I will take you out of the city, and I have. Now, I have fulfilled my promise.\u201d\u201cIs this the outside world?\u201dXue Ningxiang darted her eyes around and breathed in, a smile playing on her lips, \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m walking outside the city.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m finally out!\u201dXue Ningxiang laughed and blushed, \u201cThank you, big brother Zhuo!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. We shook on it, didn\u2019t we?\u201d Zhuo Fan said, \u201cNing\u2019er, this might be the right time to say goodbye.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d Xue Ningxiang jerked her head up, her eyes fixed on Zhuo Fan, \u201cWhere to?\u201dHe sighed as he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. There are still so many things I need to do.\u201dThe most pressing matters were finding the Lightning Canyon, Heavenly Emperor\u2019s remnant, and searching for experts to strengthen the Luo clan. Despite having no clue where to start on any of them, he had to keep looking.Xue Ningxiang saw his mind was set and spoke softly, \u201cBig brother Zhuo, c-can I come with you?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Zhuo Fan denied, \u201cWith your strength, you will be in too much danger.\u201dXue Ningxiang lowered her head in defeat. She knew she\u2019d be just a burden to him if she went.Zhuo Fan tousled her head with a smile, \u201cAnd you still have your clan to look after. Xue clan offended Hell Valley and needs to find someone that can protect it. The Sword Marquise Abode is a good choice. From Xie Tianyang\u2019s sharp mouth, he must be quite high placed. If he vouches for you, Sword Marquise Abode is sure to take you in.\u201dXue Ningxiang raised her head then nodded.Now was the time to look for a safe place for her clan. It would be too cruel of her, and selfish, to go with Zhuo Fan and leave her father and brothers in danger.She was embarrassed but still felt reluctant to part with him.\u201cHa-ha-ha, bye, little sister!\u201dZhuo Fan ruffled her head one last time and left with a smile. Tears formed in Xue Ningxiang\u2019s eyes as she shouted, \u201cBig brother Zhuo, when will we see each other again?\u201d\u201cWhen the Thunder Ring flashes!\u201dZhuo Fan waved as he walked away, the Thunder Ring on his and Xue Ningxiang\u2019s fingers flashing\u2026In another area, Jian Suifeng was looking down on You Guiqi\u2019s corpse, the enemy who robbed him of his three fingers. He recalled You Guiqi\u2019s wretched death and his mood livened.\u201cOh, You Guiqi, what a tragedy befell you, one of the great men of Tianyu Empire!\u201dJian Suifeng found that the Hell Valley guards Zhuo Fan routed were now scrambling away from this place, abandoning even their elder\u2019s body.Only a cold wind blew over the white hairs on You Guiqi\u2019s body which was lying there on the cold and hard ruble. His eyes were wide, despited losing their light.Xie Tianyang was still looking at the sky, in Zhuo Fan\u2019s direction, but then spoke in a sour tone, \u201cDamn bastard, good for you killing You Guiqi, but what are you playing at taking Ning\u2019er?\u201d\u201cTianyang, help the others down, we\u2019ll rush to Sword Marquise Abode to heal them. The Xue clan will become Sword Marquise Abode\u2019s vassal clan.\u201d Jian Suifeng indicated towards the crucified Xue clansmen.Xie Tianyang jumped and smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s my intention. Eighth elder, who knew we thought alike? I was also going to save Ning\u2019er\u2019s clan.\u201d\u201cHumph, who is like minded with a brat?\u201dJian Suifeng snorted, \u201cYou\u2019ve seen what that little monster is capable of. Only time will tell how far his strength will reach. Since he went out of his way to save these people, it won\u2019t hurt to earn his favor. We might even become friends in the future. And in case we stand on opposite sides, we can use these people as hostages to deal with him.\u201dXie Tianyang only smiled wryly at his elder\u2019s reasoning.[Humph, so you\u2019re not saving Xue clan because of me but because of that prick Zhuo Fan. Just who is a Sword Marquise Abode\u2019s core disciple here anyway?][If this gets out, my name will be dragged through the mud!]Although secretly cursing, he still went to work. Since this was his aim all along, to help Xue Ningxiang.Yet none was the wiser as half a mile out, You Ming was curled up in shivers.His fear of Zhuo Fan grew out of proportion, to such a scale that he might never overcome this heart demon.[Bastard, this is the third time! What did I ever do to you? Everywhere I go, you come killing! Last time you killed two elders and this time you killed my master.][Abomination!]You Ming cursed Zhuo Fan to high heavens. But when Zhuo Fan\u2019s cold face resurfaced in his mind, shivers wreaked his body\u2026***A month later, in the Emperor\u2019s gardens of the Imperial capital.Two old men were playing chess beneath a pavilion. One of them was dressed in a golden gown and had white temples and cloudy eyes, he was the Emperor of Tianyu Empire.The other elderly had a long beard, white hair, and exuded an imposing aura. Whenever a guard looked his way, their eyes were filled with respect.Among the melodious chirping of the garden birds, the chess pieces being moved made for a calming rhythm.Suddenly, a wail broke the blissful peace, \u201cLord Father, something big just happened\u2026\u201dA two hundred kilo round ball of flesh rolled next to the emperor. He shook the very earth he stepped on and threw the chess match into a mess.Rubbing his forehead, the emperor smiled dejectedly at the other man, who only smiled understandingly.\u201cCong\u2019er, didn\u2019t I tell you to face all events with calm? And haven\u2019t you noticed that I am playing chess with Mr. Sima?\u201d\u201cY-yes, I know my wrongs.\u201d Yuwen Cong rushed a bow to the emperor and the elderly, then wiped the sweat from his forehead.\u201cSpeak, what is the matter?\u201dThe emperor held on to another chess piece, not minding his son.Yuwen Cong forced his excitement down and said in a grave tone, \u201cReporting to Lord Father, Hell Valley\u2019s Seventh elder was killed a month ago!\u201dThe chess piece in the emperor\u2019s hand clanked on the board and he looked at the frowning Mr. Sima.\u201cWho did it?\u201d The emperor then turned his hardened face towards Yuwen Cong.Seeing no one around, Yuwen Cong whispered, \u201cIt is someone from the clan we are currently endorsing, Luo clan\u2019s steward, Zhuo Fan. A month ago, something got into him that he killed the seventh elder of Hell Valley in Blue Expanse City under everyone\u2019s eyes. It was also revealed that he was the one who killed Hell Valley\u2019s two other elders in Windgaze City and used Veiled Dragon Pavilion as a patsy.\u201d\u201cWhat? A brat killed Hell Valley\u2019s three elders, their precious You Guiqi included? What guts!\u201d Mr. Sima said to the emperor, \u201cYour Majesty, how should we handle it?\u201dThe emperor evoked a faint smile and kept playing chess, \u201cIf it only involved the seven houses, it would\u2019ve posed a headache. But as matters stand, You Wanshan won\u2019t have the cheek to complain to me. Don\u2019t let them snuff out the Luo clan. This pearl of mine is about to reveal it\u2019s splendor, ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201dBam!The emperor slammed the chess piece with delight.Yuwen Cong looked long at the emperor then bowed and left.***Prime minister\u2019s residence in the Imperial Capital.Prime Minister Zhuge Changfeng laid on a rocking chair with half-closed eyes, swaying gently. Suddenly, a black shadow whispered in his ear.\u201cWhat?\u201dZhuge Changfeng flashed his eyes open in shock, then sighed, \u201cThe balance between the seven houses is now askew. I will need to make ample preparations for the aftermath.\u201dAnd he resumed his previous state, gently swaying on the rocking chair.***High Priest\u2019s residence in Imperial Capital.A white-haired elder was reading through some information delivered by one of his men. As he read through, a frown appeared on his forehead and he signaled his men to withdraw.With shaking steps deigning his old appearance, the elder walked into the observatory and looked up towards the sea of stars, \u201cThe star of war is near and turmoil is on our doorsteps. A spark is enough to light this powder keg! The ruler is about to change, I only hope the people can weather the storm.\u201d***Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s headquarters.Pavilion Lord Long Yifey and some elders were in a meeting, but two young people were also present, Long Jie and Long Kui. Because of their efforts and brilliant conduct, seven days ago, Long Yifey officially allowed them to participate in the elder council, pleasing the two to no end.\u201cRecently, Xiao Kui and Xiao Jie have displayed impeccable conduct. I propose to send them to cultivate under the Grand Elder and learn the house\u2019s profound ranked martial art.\u201dLong Yifey smiled looking at the two and spoke with pride.Third elder commented with a hardened look, \u201cThese two kids progressed well, however, they are only average by contrast with the other houses\u2019 genius disciples.\u201d\u201cHow? Third elder, don\u2019t underestimate us. We are on the verge of breaking through to the Bone Tempering Stage.\u201d Long Kui protested while Long Jie was in accord, \u201cThird elder is right. I heard rumors that Sword Marquise Abode\u2019s Xie Tianyang became a Bone Tempering expert three years prior. We are still far behind him.\u201d\u201cXiao Jie is so modest! You will do great deeds in the future!\u201dGodeye Long Jiu nodded with satisfaction, a black crow perched on his shoulder; the Soul Devouring Crow he got from Zhuo Fan. Looking at the bird, Long Jiu couldn\u2019t help his expression softening.\u201cIf you two brats were half a man my brother Zhuo is, you\u2019d be training our passed down profound ranked martial art by now.\u201d\u201cHumph, Uncle Jiu, why bring him into this?\u201d Long Kui always became irritated whenever she heard Zhuo Fan\u2019s name, \u201cHe is cocky, brash, and doesn\u2019t want to join Veiled Dragon Pavilion. Even if he has a smidgen of talent, that doesn\u2019t make his rise guaranteed. We will undoubtedly surpass him.\u201dA man suddenly barged in while shouting, \u201cUrgent report, Pavilion Lord!\u201dThird elder waved him away after taking the report and read it. The next moment, his hand froze and the paper drifted to the floor.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, third elder?\u201dLong Jiu picked up the paper in worry, never having seen third elder so spooked. But the contents left his sole eye in tears.\u201cGood brother, I owe you again.\u201d\u201cWhat is all this about?\u201d Long Yifey was inquisitive like the rest of the people present and took the paper.His brows shook and his voice betrayed his excitement, \u201cHell Valley\u2019s You Guiqi was killed by Zhuo Fan in Blue Expanse City!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dEveryone was dumbstruck.Who hadn\u2019t heard of You Guiqi? He was the greatest headache of everyone, especially for Long Jiu, who had his eye stolen in You Guiqi\u2019s ploy.Yet this dreadful man was killed by Zhuo Fan. Their shock was understandable. Even Long Jie and Long Kui had heard of You Guiqi\u2019s infamy, after all, he was a man feared by all elders of the Veiled Dragon Pavilion.They instantly felt how far behind Zhuo Fan had left them.\u201cHa-ha-ha, well done!\u201d Long Yifey burst in laughter, \u201cI was right in my decision. This kid is a dragon among men. Increase our support to the Luo clan and send some men to safeguard their clan. I\u2019m sure we all can agree on that.\u201dIt was a unanimous decision. Not even the elders who were against Long Yifey proposing an alliance with Zhuo Fan showed any complaint.After all, none of them here could do what Zhuo Fan did, sending that You Guiqi to his grave.And the Veiled Dragon Pavilion was just the beginning. The continent\u2019s clans soon came to know of this affair. Among the shocks and cries of joy, Zhuo Fan\u2019s name was etched in the minds of many clan leaders.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 - Hell Kill OrderPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn a lone valley, sieged by mountains on three sides and a narrow trail on the fourth, the sun\u2019s warm glow barely reached this place throughout the year. Being shrouded in mist, this place was a cesspool of poisonous insects and rats.Yet this particularly strange environment led to the development of some of the rarest herbs the world had ever seen. To gathered such ingredients, men braved many dangers through the valley, where the mortality rate was incredibly high and the ghosts of the fallen exacerbated the gloom.People came to call it, Hell Valley.A thousand years ago, a powerful group stumbled upon this odd place and established a foothold. They even set up a 5th-grade array to safeguard from the gruesomeness of this valley.This group was the You house, one of the Seven Noble Houses of Tianyu Empire. With time, people came to call this valley as the strongest house that could oppose the Imperial family.Until now.In Hell Valley\u2019s meeting hall, Valley Lord You Wanshan was in a poor mood as he sat on his throne. Out of the 12 total seats, 9 seats were occupied by elders. Each time he glanced at the empty seats, his eyes turned savage.\u201cYou Ming!\u201dYou Wanshan bellowed, \u201cDo you mean to say that three of Hell Valley\u2019s elders are dead because of a single kid?\u201dKowtowing on the ground and shivering uncontrollably, You Ming replied, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even think of lying to Valley Lord. Elder Jian, Elder Yun, as well as my master, Seventh elder, were indeed killed by Luo clan\u2019s steward, Zhuo Fan!\u201d\u201cUseless wench!\u201d You Wanshan slapped the table, \u201cYou knew he killed two elders before so why didn\u2019t you report this sooner?\u201d\u201cSpare me, Valley Lord! It was my master who forbade me. Master found it too weird and ordered me to keep it to myself. He told me that he will find the opportunity to deal with Zhuo Fan. But before he could, Zhuo Fan broke into our city and\u2026\u201dAt this point, You Ming\u2019s voice was choked with sobs.The rest of the elders snorted.[All demonic cultivators are cruel and cold, so why is this punk getting so worked up?]Throwing such a show would make them despise him instead.The elders were all clear this wasn\u2019t his fault yet refrained from pardoning him. If they\u2019d trade places, they would do the same. If not, they\u2019d be accused of rash thinking and that would be used as an excuse by some others to remove them.Who would believe that a fresh Bone Tempering kid could kill a Profound Heaven seasoned expert if not for it happening before countless eyes?\u201cValley Lord, You Ming might have erred, but he had no control over what happened. Our first priority is to deal with the aftermath.\u201dThis was spoken by the first elder on the right as he stood up, \u201cTianyu Empire\u2019s mighty clans have set their sights on us. If we let that kid go unpunished, what will the people think? We will become the laughingstock of the empire and our vassal clans will abandon us.\u201dYou Wanshan frowned, his eyes filled with cruelty, \u201cGrand Elder is right. We cannot let that punk get away with this! Wasn\u2019t he some steward of Luo clan? We\u2019ll make the Luo clan answer for his transgression!\u201d\u201cValley Lord, you mustn\u2019t!\u201dA deep and worried voice traveled from an old man with raven hair, seated on the opposite side of Grand Elder.You Wanshan snorted, \u201cSecond elder, what are you trying to say? Do you think it\u2019s alright for someone to kill our people, shame us, and then walk away? What will others think of Hell Valley?\u201d\u201cValley Lord, I am not stopping you from settling this debt. Only\u2026\u201dSecond elder muttered something before resuming, \u201cValley Lord should remember the ban the Emperor enacted a year ago on the seven houses which was against stepping foot in Windgaze City. If we breach it openly, it will give the Imperial family the excuse to strike.\u201d\u201cSecond elder makes a fair point. This is not the time to move in the open. And there are also reports that the Imperial family and Veiled Dragon Pavilion\u2019s experts are patrolling nearby Windgaze City. We will fall into their trap if we go!\u201d Grand Elder urged.Eying the two most respected elders, You Wanshan hesitated for a while before spatting through gritted teeth, \u201cWe can\u2019t do this, we can\u2019t do that! What else can we actually do?\u201dEven the elders turned silent.You Wanshan sighed, \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t have been such a headache if the seventh elder was here. Blasted punk, he managed to rob me of my wisest adviser. When I get my hands on you, I will skin you alive!\u201dSeeing them all pensive, the kneeling You Ming darted his eyes left and right before making a tentative remark, \u201cValley Lord, may disciple be so bold as to convey a solution?\u201d\u201cHumph, the elders meeting is not something you can join. Get the hell out!\u201d You Wanshan barked without even looking at You Ming. But Grand Elder\u2019s gesture detained him, \u201cValley Lord, the kid can be considered as seventh elder\u2019s successor. Why not give him a chance?\u201dYou Wanshan conceded when he heard the Grand Elder\u2019s reason.You Ming\u2019s heart burst with joy as he rushed to explain, \u201cValley Lord, this disciple\u2019s humble opinion is to ignore the Luo clan. From my observation, Luo clan is relying on Zhuo Fan. With him around, even if we remove the Luo clan, it will only make it worse for us. But if Zhuo Fan is out of the picture, then the Luo clan will fall from grace. They will have no hope of replacing us, Hell Valley!\u201dYou Wanshan\u2019s eyes flickered, \u201cGo on.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d His mouth twisted in a smile, You Ming said, \u201cWe cannot approach Windgaze City, but Zhuo Fan is nowhere near it either. We just need to focus all our efforts in dealing with him.\u201d\u201cAnd how will we find him?\u201d You Wanshan questioned.\u201cIssue the Hell Kill Order and have the empire corner him!\u201d You Ming revealed his savage side, \u201cWe will then know where he is going, and before he returns to Windgaze City, we can just ambush him.\u201dYou Wanshan cackled, \u201cGood, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do!\u201d\u201cMen!\u201d He then shouted orders, \u201cIn my name as Hell Valley\u2019s leader, I declare the Hell Kill Order on Zhuo Fan. Anyone who provides clues to his location can become a vassal to Hell Valley. Anyone who brings me his head will become Hell Valley\u2019s number one vassal, ruling above all others!\u201dYou Wanshan\u2019s sinister laughter echoed, to which You Ming followed up with a vile smile.[Zhuo Fan, you abomination! I won\u2019t dare face you but now you have the whole empire after your head, he-he-he\u2026]Grand Elder smiled, [As I thought, this kid is still thinking about revenge.] But the elder didn\u2019t care since Zhuo Fan was the enemy of Hell Valley\u2026Grand Elder stated, \u201cValley Lord, even if we declare Hell Kill Order on Zhuo Fan, since he killed seventh elder, the weak clans won\u2019t be his match. I think we will have to act if we want to end him after all.\u201d\u201cThen all elders move out, kill that bastard!\u201d\u201cWait!\u201dGrand Elder gestured, \u201cHe killed seventh elder, elders below seventh won\u2019t be of any help. From Ming\u2019er\u2019s retelling of him, he must be a body refining demonic cultivator. The only ones who can stand up to him are the first five elders. Furthermore\u2026\u201dHe turned to a red-haired elder, \u201cFifth elder, you refined your body with the Scorching Demon Flame. Your unbreakable body is the perfect match for that kid!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t look at me!\u201d Yet the man in question shook his hands again and again while smirking, \u201cI am about to join Drifting Flowers Edifice\u2019s Hundred Pill Meeting. I don\u2019t have the time to run around after some snot-nosed brat!\u201d\u201cHumph, what\u2019s so great being invited by women to a meeting to discuss about pills? Is going there more important than taking revenge for the house?\u201d You Wanshan snapped.Grand Elder lightened the atmosphere with a smile, \u201cValley Lord, the Drifting Flowers Edifice may be made up of women, but they are still one of the seven houses. Establishing a close relationship will only work in our favor. They extended an invitation to fifth elder since they took an interest in his fire attribute cultivation method, in hope of refining new pills.\u201d\u201cHumph, how did a bunch of skanks climb up to our position? One day I will personally go and take over their domain.\u201d You Wanshan said viciously.Grand Elder shook his head, \u201cValley Lord, I would like to have You Ming participate in seventh elder\u2019s place in our future elder meetings.\u201dStaring at You Ming, You Wanshan nodded, \u201cFine, raise him well, as the next Insidious Demon, ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201dYou Ming was overjoyed in his bowing!Meanwhile, in Blackwind Mountain, Captain Pang was cultivating by sitting on 36 blades. His body was riddled with scars. While cultivating, black tendrils of energy would leave his body, drift around the blades, and return back to him.But as each black tendril went back into his body, a new bloody scar adorned his wreaked body, making him frown.Suddenly, a shadow grew before him and Lei Yuting came from behind.Cracking his eyelids, Captain Pang stood up with a smirk, \u201cMiss Lei\u2019s Elusive Shadow Art is becoming more and more outstanding. I didn\u2019t even notice you were coming.\u201d\u201cHumph, your Wraith Art isn\u2019t any less impressive, reaching Bone Tempering Stage in just a year. You\u2019re making those clans\u2019 geniuses jealous.\u201d\u201cHe-he-he, it\u2019s all because of brother Zhuo!\u201d Captain Pang laughed and peeked next to him. Not five meters from him, a 15-year old was braving above other blades as sweat marred his brow and trailed along his scarred body.But around him were corpses riddled with wounds, as if hacked by countless edged weapons.\u201cDamn it, what kind of vile method are you cultivating?\u201d Lei Yuting cursed.Captain Pang replied with indifference, \u201cOf the 20 kids you sent, only one barely made it. Send me another batch.\u201d\u201cWith just one survivor you want more?\u201d Lei Yuting raised her voice in shock.Captain Pang smirked, \u201cIt\u2019s actually quite a good result. For fifty to die while training in this art is normal. But for Luo clan, everything is worth it.\u201d\u201cHumph, you are hard at cultivating, and what is that brother of yours doing?\u201d Snorting, Lei Yuting fetched a paper, \u201cHe killed Hell Valley\u2019s seventh elder and they\u2019ve issued a kill order.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Captain Pang burst into laughter, \u201cBrother Zhuo truly does incredible things, shaking the world everywhere he goes.\u201dThen he patted Lei Yuting\u2019s shoulder, \u201cMiss Lei, don\u2019t be too worried. With brother Zhuo\u2019s skills, Hell Valley\u2019s order won\u2019t affect him.\u201d\u201cHumph, who the hell cares about him.\u201d Lei Yuting muttered through gnashed teeth, \u201cHe just went and provoked Hell Valley over a girl. Since when was he so goody-goody?\u201dCaptain Pang grinned, \u201cSo that\u2019s what it was, ha-ha-ha. Sometimes, brother Zhuo quite likes striking a heroic figure.\u201d\u201cHero? My ass! You think I don\u2019t know him?\u201d Sighing, Lei Yuting turned into a shadow and vanished.Captain Pang shouted the next moment, \u201cDon\u2019t mention this to young miss, especially the last part.\u201dBut Lei Yuting\u2019s response didn\u2019t come. Captain Pang sighed, \u201cAh, women\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 - Wraith StylePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAtchoo!\u201cWho\u2019s badmouthing me behind my back?\u201dIn a secluded forest, Zhuo Fan scratched his nose and set his eyes on a 100-meter-tall rock.He suddenly flexed his legs and jumped, with the wings behind him flashing with lightning.\u201cWraith Style 1st move, Soaring Demonic Dragon!\u201dRoar!A black draconic image flashed with him at its center. The dragon intertwined with the lightning and smashed into the rock.Boom!The rock crumbled like a stack of cards and Zhuo Fan came out with a flash. Then he turned around and unleashed a black claw at the rubble.\u201cWraith Style 2nd move, Ghostly Dragon Claw!\u201dIt was lackluster compared to the previous thundering explosion but it made up for it with visual impact, turning the rubble to sand.The tremors even frightened the birds away. Zhuo Fan gasped as he continued sweating, but his hands kept dancing through gestures, aiming for the flock of birds.\u201cWraith Style 3rd move, Necro Dragon\u2019s Screech!\u201dRoar!The sound was eerie, akin to a demon. Zhuo Fan\u2019s wail even made ripples through the air as it swept the flock of birds.The birds froze mid-air, their eyes blanked, and fell dead. One look would spot thousands of dead birds.Zhuo Fan was now reduced to a gasping mess, crouching down with a downcast look.This low profound ranked martial art matched the Wraith Art. Each strike held enough power to shake the earth and kill instantly. Although ranked low, it was nonetheless strong as a mid profound ranked martial art.The problem was the high requirement these moves had on the body, making it viable only to Wraith Art cultivators. But with Zhuo Fan\u2019s refined body, he long surpassed it.In theory, these moves should\u2019ve been easy for him to execute.Yet the fact remained, only after training in them for a month did he realize that he didn\u2019t lack in the body department, but in the soul. He was in the 1st layer of Bone Tempering Stage and using profound ranked martial art almost exhausted his Yuan Qi.The last move, in particular, Necro Dragon\u2019s Screech, was a soul attack that could only be trained when one was in the Radiant Stage.With his body and soul refined, his soul power shot up, and even with the added benefit of the azure flame, he just barely succeeded. But it didn\u2019t stop him from feeling his vision swoon and collapse.\u201cGoddamit! These moves will be the death of me. If I don\u2019t kill my enemy with these, he will kill me.\u201dZhuo Fan sighed and sat cross-legged to recover his Yuan Qi.Killing You Guiqi stirred up a hornet nest. He was bound to stumble on a far stronger opponent and needed to protect himself by training powerful martial arts.As a consequence, he hid for over a month in the mountains to practice, yet the outcome wasn\u2019t in the least bit reassuring.Half a day later, Zhuo Fan stood up with a rosy complexion, having recovered.His hand flashed and was now holding a large egg. He looked at the singed marks on the egg with worry.The Thunder Skylark egg was still alive thanks to its mother\u2019s spiritual energy. But this only put a delay on things. If he wanted to hatch it, he\u2019d first have to restore its vitality.[Just where am I supposed to look for the needed spiritual herbs in this vast world?]The egg wasn\u2019t fully developed yet and common herbs wouldn\u2019t do any good. He\u2019d need those rare treasures capable of snatching a man\u2019s life from the jaws of imminent death.Zhuo Fan couldn\u2019t help but frown at this thought.\u201cSong Yu, hand over the Body Tempering Pill if you know what\u2019s good for you.\u201dA sudden shout interrupted Zhuo Fan\u2019s musings. His face darkened and walked over.[Who\u2019s the bastard that dares disturb my peace?]Pushing a branch aside, Zhuo Fan saw a man and a woman driving a carriage. The man was around 20 with fine features and at 1st layer of Bone Tempering Stage cultivation, while the woman was of similar age, charming complexion, and in the 2nd layer.They were surrounded by six men, of who five where in the 8-9th layer of Bone Tempering Stage and the last one, an old man, was in the 6th.The pair was now staring daggers at the old man.\u201cHumph, the Body Tempering Pill was made by us, the Song clan, through a secret formula to join in the Hundred Pill Meeting. You think I\u2019m just going to give it away?\u201d The man snorted and a 1st-grade spiritual weapon appeared in his hand.Zhuo Fan smiled in derision.The Body Tempering Pill was a 4th-grade pill, useful in tempering one\u2019s bones, and also useful in aiding a 9th layer Qi Condensation cultivator in breaking through to the Bone Tempering Stage. The only downside was that it could only be used once.For the genius Zhuo Fan, who was worry-free about breaking through to Bone Tempering Stage, this pill was garbage. [And this crappy pill was made from a secret formula; what a bunch of weaklings.]But the bloodshot-eyed old man thought otherwise.\u201cHa-ha-ha, Song Yu, Song Qian, aren\u2019t the two of you in the Bone Tempering Stage at such a young age thanks to it? Your third-rate clan, which seized the secret formula for a 4th-grade pill, is being too greedy. It\u2019s best if you just hand it over.\u201d\u201cHumph, we would rather die!\u201dSong Qian and Song Yu charged at the old man who did the same.Bam!From just a single palm attack, both of them drew wide arcs in the air trailed by their blood. Despite being in the same stage, the difference of 5-6 layers wasn\u2019t something they could overcome.\u201cHe-he-he, miss Song Qian, is this necessary? Be good and hand the pill and its formula. Are you going to force this old man into patting down the both of you?\u201dThe old man eyed Song Qian\u2019s enticing curves and let out lascivious laughter.Song Qian glared with hatred but then sighed and looked at her brother, \u201cAre you scared?\u201d\u201cI am not!\u201d Song Yu\u2019s steeled himself.\u201cThen let us die together. At least the clan\u2019s formula won\u2019t land in that old bastard\u2019s hands.\u201d Song Qian made a downcast smile and raised Song Yu\u2019s spiritual weapon to their necks.This scene stirred Zhuo Fan\u2019s heart, his mind drifting to the siblings in the Windgaze City. [They would\u2019ve had the same ending if I wasn\u2019t compelled by the heart demon at that time.]Sighing, Zhuo Fan shot a leaf at the pair.Whoosh!Just when it was about to slit their throats, the weapon fell off her hands.\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Both the siblings and the old man shouted anxiously.\u201cIs it really necessary to kill them over a 4th-grade pill?\u201d Zhuo Fan stepped out of the tree line. The old man laughed, \u201cHere I was nervous who might come, and it\u2019s only a brat fresh into the Bone Tempering Stage.\u201d He mocked Zhuo Fan.\u201cKid, aren\u2019t you a demonic cultivator? Everyone knows demonic cultivators are the most savage and ruthless bunch out there, and you have the cheek to preach me on mercy?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not preaching mercy, but power.\u201dZhuo Fan sneered, \u201cNow that I have witnessed this matter, you can\u2019t kill them.\u201d\u201cHumph, with just you?\u201dThe old man\u2019s eyes glinted with malice as Song Qian shouted anxiously, \u201cLittle brother, run! Save yourself and forget about us!\u201d\u201cRun? Too late.\u201dWhile Song Qian was urging him, the old man charged at Zhuo Fan with a snicker, \u201cKid, you only got yourself to blame for poking your nose where it does not belong.\u201dThe siblings could only close their eyes to be spared of the horror.Yet with a crisp sound, Zhuo Fan stood unfazed while the old man fell in a pool of blood, headless.The laughing old man was dead in an instant and despite the others having smiles on their faces, their eyes were filled with terror.They clearly saw how Zhuo Fan made a casual attack and popped the old man\u2019s head.\u201cMonster!\u201dA scream echoed and the others ran for their lives. Zhuo Fan didn\u2019t care about them and turned to leave.\u201cWait!\u201dSong Qian called. Her eyes were in shock of Zhuo Fan\u2019s immense strength despite similar cultivation levels.It was as different as heaven and earth\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85, - Hundred Pill MeetingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWhat is it?\u201dZhuo Fan asked as he turned slowly. He noticed the elegant beauty, yet he didn\u2019t bat an eyelid. Song Qian was the one to be affected by his gaze instead, blushing and lowering her head.\u201cI have yet to know little brother\u2019s name. One day, the Song clan will repay you for saving our lives!\u201d\u201cNo need!\u201d Saying so, Zhuo Fan started leaving.Startled, Song Qian felt somewhat discouraged in her heart. All males in a hundred miles of Song clan would be speechless in her presence, yet Zhuo Fan gave her the cold shoulder. This led to the rising discontent inside her.She skipped before Zhuo Fan and stopped him by raising her hand.But he just frowned, \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d[This fool!] Song Qian was cursing inside but showed an enticing smiled on the outside, \u201cLittle brother, where are you planning on going?\u201d\u201cNone of your business!\u201d Zhuo Fan bypassed her with a snort. Song Qian\u2019s mouth was twitching as she shouted, \u201cWe are on our way to Hundred Pill Meeting. Why not join us?\u201dZhuo Fan paused, then turned, \u201cDrifting Flowers City, the home of Drifting Flowers Edifice, one of the Seven Noble Houses?\u201d\u201cExactly!\u201d Nodded Song Yu as he rushed over, \u201cDrifting Flowers Edifice holds the Hundred Pill Meeting once a decade. It is a gathering where famous alchemists from clans around the empire compete over their refining method. If luck would have it, the Drifting Flowers Edifice would take notice of you and take you in as a vassal clan!\u201dZhuo Fan scratched his nose. [Hundred Pill Meeting is bound to have plenty of rare ingredients and the chance is high for me to find the treasures to restore the egg.]He made a lopsided grin, \u201cYou\u2019re words caught my interest. I would very much like to see the Hundred Pill Meeting.\u201d\u201cGreat! Let\u2019s go together.\u201d Song Qian jumped in joy.Zhuo Fan smiled, [Asuming another identity while entering one of the seven houses isn\u2019t a bad idea.]The Song siblings were glad he agreed. With Zhuo Fan\u2019s strength, nothing would stop them from reaching Drifting Flowers City.\u201cOh, what do I call little brother?\u201d\u201cUh, Luo Fan!\u201d Zhuo Fan scratched his nose.He could no longer risk giving his real name, not since Blue Expanse City. He figured the entire Tianyu Empire was privy to his name by now. Then again, he was Luo clan\u2019s steward, and using their name was perfectly normal.\u201cSong Qian, Song Yu!\u201d The two introduced.Zhuo Fan then followed the sister and entered the carriage, which had various ingredients strewn about, while the younger brother drove it.But Zhuo Fan didn\u2019t even spare these plain items a glance.Song Qian kept making eyes with Zhuo Fan, but seeing her efforts hit a wall, she turned awkwardly to look out the window.But then she burst into a giggle with a red face.Seeing this, Zhuo Fan rolled his eyes, [She either lost it or is smitten. I wouldn\u2019t have gone with them if I knew.]Throughout the trip, Song Qian treated him like a rare breed, eying him at every chance. He tried his hardest in switching places with Song Yu, but the kid turned him down and he was forced to endure the doe eyes from Song Yu\u2019s sister.After a long half a month, the carriage slowly approached a city\u2019s gates. Song Yu laughed, \u201cBrother Luo, sister, we\u2019re here!\u201d\u201cAbout freakin\u2019 time!\u201d Zhuo Fan stepped out in a rush from the red hot gaze of the other passenger. But then he cursed when he noticed the gate, \u201cHow in the hell is this Drifting Flowers City? Why did you even stop here?\u201dThe plaque above the gate read: Orchid City.This wasn\u2019t under any of the seven houses\u2019 jurisdiction, but the Imperial family.\u201cHa-ha-ha, brother Luo, calm yourself. An old friend of my father stays here. We\u2019ve come to Orchid City to buy ingredients from him before setting out to Hundred Pill Meeting.\u201dHearing this, Zhuo Fan could only sigh. [Will my suffering ever end?]Song Qian stepped out and glared, \u201cDo you hate being around me?\u201dZhuo Fan just shrugged.But Song Yu laughed and revealed a vulgar smile, \u201cBrother Luo, I know exactly how you feel. I am the same, itching to get to Drifting Flowers City. They say the 15 Overseers of Drifting Flowers Edifice are like fairies, and the Edifice Lord an outstanding beauty, proclaimed as the number one beauty in the empire. If I can see her once, my life is fulfilled.\u201dSong Yu wore an intoxicated look. It was as if he could really see them, but then he woke up and noticed his sister looking glum and disdained, \u201cBut even my sister\u2019s beauty is hard to come by. Although, how could a man pick just one, when the world is filled with ravishing beauties?\u201d\u201cXiao Yu, what did you say?\u201d Song Qian heard him and her glare sent him shivering. Zhuo Fan just shook his head.[They\u2019re a pair of clowns, one love-struck, the other a moron. I need to get far away from them or I\u2019ll find myself at their level soon.]\u201cQian\u2019er!\u201dTheir conversation was interrupted when they heard a shout. Song Qian stiffened, knowing who the person was.It came from a finely clothed young man, who looked casual and confident in his demeanor. He was around 20 years old and in the 4th layer of Bone Tempering Stage. Song Qian however seemed not too eager in seeing him, giving an awkward greeting, \u201cBrother Tianlei!\u201dSong Yu also stiffened, whispering to Zhuo Fan, \u201cHe is Qi Tianlei, Orchid City\u2019s top clan\u2019s young master. The Qi clan is an old friend of ours, but they are a second-rate clan and they always make a point to show it. Also, Qi Tianlei is crazy for my sister\u2026\u201dZhuo Fan sighed, already feeling regret following this pair.The Luo clan and Song clan were similar, but the former had the privilege of Demonic Emperor gracing them with his presence, elevating it to a first-rate clan.[Similar people, different fates!]\u201cQian\u2019er, who\u2019s he?\u201d Even as Qi Tianlei was caressing Song Qian\u2019s fair hand, he was always watching the other two. But while his eyes were filled with contempt for Song Yu, it revealed only hostility towards Zhuo Fan.\u201cH-He is Brother Luo, our friend.\u201d Song Qian was fearful of Qi Tianlei, but even with a tremor in her voice, she tried to protect Zhuo Fan. She then rushed to change topics, \u201cTianlei, how did you know we\u2019re coming today?\u201d\u201cI received Uncle Song\u2019s letter and estimated when you\u2019d arrive.\u201d Qi Tianlei spoke casually then marched before Zhuo Fan, pushing aside Song Qian who blocked his way, \u201cWho are you to Qian\u2019er?\u201d\u201cBrother Qi, he is my friend\u2026\u201dBam!Qi Tianlei slapped Song Yu away, \u201cI wasn\u2019t asking you!\u201dHe turned toward Zhuo Fan with a wild look, \u201cSpeak, what is there between you two?\u201dZhuo Fan saw Song Qian helping her brother. Looking at their terrified states, he knew they were oppressed by this young master of the Qi clan.\u201cOn our way, we ate together and slept together. We practically never left the carriage. You tell me if there\u2019s anything between us!\u201dSong Qian was shocked, knowing he did it just to spite Qi Tianlei.And Qi Tianlei\u2019s eyes were now bloodshot as he unleashed his power.\u201cWretched filth, I will have your head!\u201d He declared as he threw himself at Zhuo Fan.But Zhuo Fan remained calm and unmoving.Then, a sudden sound was heard and a ripple spread from Zhuo Fan\u2019s chest.Ice-cold killing intent swept everyone\u2019s minds, freezing them. They were scared as rabbits, powerless to even resist it.Qi Tianlei looked as if he was seeing a demon from hell, shivering all the while. As for his fury, it vanished into nothing.Killing with intent was a Radiant Stage expert\u2019s absolute power.Zhuo Fan was no Radiant Stage expert, but his soul was strong enough to train in the Wraith Style\u2019s Necro Dragon\u2019s Screech. It was far from being able to kill with intent, but enough to scare.This was a feat not even a Profound Heaven expert was capable of, yet a freak of nature like Zhuo Fan could\u2026Strolling before the shivering Qi Tianlei, Zhuo Fan whispered in his ear, \u201cThe next time you try showing off before me, I will end you!\u201dQi Tianlei hit the ground with a thud and couldn\u2019t stop sweating.While the Song siblings stood shell shocked\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 - Murder FestPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHe scared them into submission without lifting a finger. Just how was he a Bone Tempering cultivator?Song Qian and Song Yu saw a whole new Zhuo Fan and their hearts started racing.Whoosh!Suddenly, a figure landed before Qi Tianlei. He checked the young master and became enraged finding him unconscious.\u201cWho did this?\u201d The newcomer whipped his head back and roared, his eyes flickering with flames of rage. But then he noticed Zhuo Fan and all of a sudden his anger diffused.Zhuo Fan frowned and took a much closer look at him.The man was around 40 years old, with a beard and at peak Bone Tempering Stage. From the fine clothes he was wearing, it was clear he was a Clan Head.Song Qian, who was roused from her shock by the shout, began apologizing with tears welling in her eyes, \u201cForgive me, uncle, it\u2019s all my fault. Take it out on me.\u201dThe man\u2019s eyes then noticed the Song siblings and his gloomy face cleared up with a laugh, \u201cHa-ha-ha, so it is Qian\u2019er. I was wondering why this brat ran so fast to the city gate, seems like it was to welcome honored guests. So it was all a misunderstanding.\u201d\u201cCome, follow me to our home. You\u2019ve come a long way to Orchid City, it must have been tiring. As your host, I\u2019ll do my best to make you comfortable!\u201d The man overlooked Qi Tianlei\u2019s situation and simply shouldered the unconscious fellow as he took the lead.The way he switched tunes real quick, and how he took sideway glances on and off at Zhuo Fan, the later felt it as a warning.\u201cWhat was all that about being looked down on by Qi clan? You were clearly trying to fool me.\u201d Zhuo Fan smirked, \u201cThis uncle of yours cares for you even more than Qi Tianlei, ignoring even his scared silly son.\u201d\u201cWhy would he? He is Qi Ganglie, the Qi Clan Head, and not once did he look kindly on us.\u201d Song Yu said confused, \u201cBut today he\u2019s like a different person. Qi Tianlei is his only son, the apple of his eye. Something odd is going on for him to ignore his son\u2019s plight!\u201d\u201cYeah, baffling!\u201d Zhuo Fan scoffed.Song Qian watched Qi Ganglie leave then turned to the other two, \u201cWhat\u2019s so strange? He must be in a good mood today, so don\u2019t make assumptions. At least he didn\u2019t pursue it, or we would\u2019ve been worse off.\u201d\u201cJust him?\u201d Zhuo Fan sneered.What could a peak Bone Tempering cultivator amount to when not even a Profound Heaven expert was a match for Zhuo Fan? As his strength grew exponentially, he felt the return of his confidence as the Demonic Emperor.But anyway, the Song siblings were clueless to his strength.Song Qian walked to him with quick steps then rolled her eyes, \u201cI know you\u2019re great, but that\u2019s within the Bone Tempering Stage. Could you handle a Profound Heaven expert? If you get on their bad side, not even we can help you.\u201dZhuo Fan scoffed.Song Qian shook her head but her eyes never left Zhuo Fan. His haughty and condescending attitude stirred her maiden heart.In fact, she felt oddly safe next to him, something she never felt with anyone before.The Qi clan welcomed the trio in their residence, and before they could leave to purchase any ingredients, the Qi Clan Head\u2019s message came that he wanted to reminisce with the siblings.Without a choice, Song Qian and Song Yu went to see Qi Ganglie while Zhuo Fan was left alone in the guest house. [Now I can finally get some cultivation done in peace and quiet.]Six hours later, the door creaked open. Zhuo Fan sitting on his bed, saw the Song siblings tip-toeing inside.\u201cDid you finish your talk with Qi Ganglie?\u201dSong Qian and Song Yu jumped in fright, then nodded woodenly, their eyes full of fear.\u201cWhat\u2019s up? Was that old coot hard on you?\u201d Zhuo Fan asked with suspicion.They both denied.The more Zhuo Fan looked at them the more he felt his suspicion grow. Song Qian laughed dryly, \u201cZhu-, uh, brother Luo, Qi Clan Head is holding a feast in our welcome. Come join us.\u201dZhuo Fan smiled, \u201cSince it is for you two, I won\u2019t go as I don\u2019t know him!\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201dSong Yu exclaimed, but tried to save the situation and dispel Zhuo Fan\u2019s doubts with a forced laughter, \u201cBrother Luo, this is the Qi clan\u2019s residence. The Clan Head even threw a welcoming feast for us. It would be crass of us if we are not present.\u201dZhuo Fan raised an eyebrow, \u201cDo I have to?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d They both nodded.Zhuo Fan stood up with a sneer and said, \u201cLead the way. We must join the festivities if he went so far as to invite us, even if it ends up a murder fest.\u201dHis words had the two siblings shivering and looking guilty.Arriving at the hall, they saw Qi Ganglie seated on the main seat with a smile while nine other Bone Tempering elders flanked his sides at a round table.Looking closely, the table had three lone empty seats in the furthest corner of the hall, with walls on either side of them.Zhuo Fan secretly mocked them, [It\u2019s ridiculously obvious that they want to attack me. The fact my seat is in the worst possible position proves it.][Can\u2019t you be any more obvious?]He let out a faint smile and didn\u2019t let it get to him. [Even if they attack together, their end is still the same.]Zhuo Fan and the siblings arrived at their seats with a fake smile.\u201cQian\u2019er, Xiao Yu, I am most pleased with your visit to our city. Uncle shall toast to you, for your success in the Drifting Flowers City and joining the Drifting Flowers Edifice.\u201d Qi Ganglie laughed as he drank.The others followed suit and the Song siblings were no exception. Yet Zhuo Fan only brought the cup to his nose and then sported a wide and ineffable grin before placing it on the table.Qi Ganglie frowned a bit as the atmosphere grew tense.\u201cHa-ha-ha, little brother is called Luo Fan, right? Qian\u2019er told me about you, how you looked after them on your journey. I shall toast in gratitude.\u201dQi Ganglie drank another cup, yet Zhuo Fan was as still as a rock.This time, the people around the table eyed Zhuo Fan viciously.Qi Ganglie gave them looks to calm down and said, \u201cBrother Luo, I am the Qi Clan Head and am offering you a toast. Aren\u2019t you going to reply in kind?\u201d\u201cAs wine takes a heavy toll on one\u2019s body, I have learned to abstain from drinking.\u201d Zhuo Fan grinned, \u201cAnd I\u2019d recommend Qi Clan Head do the same. Who knows what mistakes one can make in their drunk haze? You might earn the ire of someone you should not and end up destroying yourself and your clan.\u201dHis knuckles white on the cup, Qi Ganglie felt the sweat trickling down his brow. The others were also growing anxious.Taking a moment to calm his nerves, Qi Ganglie continued with a fake smile, \u201cLittle brother is wise beyond his age. I understand now how you could become a Bone Tempering cultivator at such a young age. But a youth should be more impulsive and learn to live in the moment, enjoy the simple pleasures of life.\u201dQi Ganglie laughed, hinting at the cup before Zhuo Fan. The latter shook his head, \u201cLife is enjoyable as long as you have it. I am young and don\u2019t plan on leaving this wonderful world just yet!\u201dLosing his patience, Qi Ganglie rose from his seat and shouted, \u201cWhat do you mean by this?\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, cut the act. You know who I am, else you wouldn\u2019t have set up such an obvious trap!\u201dZhuo Fan lifted his glass and tipped it. The wine touched the table and sizzled in white smoke before eating through it.\u201cHundred Bane Pill, refined from a 4th-grade spiritual beast, the Scarlet Poisoned Python\u2019s venom!\u201dWith a mocking grin, he stared at Qi Ganglie, \u201cMost of all, these Bone Tempering experts must be your elders. Even for a junior\u2019s welcoming feast, this is too much of an honor.\u201d\u201cSigh, Clan Head, it was really hard to fake overlooking it, you know? Ha-ha-ha, can you be any more obvious?\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s mockery had Qi Ganglie flushed with anger and gasping in an attempt to calm himself down.\u201cDamn it! Since it fell through, then I\u2019ll cut to the chase.\u201d Qi Ganglie roared and his power froze the Song siblings in their seats.\u201cZhuo Fan, you messed with Hell Valley and they issued the Hell Kill Order on you, making you the number one target of the empire. Rather than let others have you, I\u2019ll take your head and claim the Hell Kill Order\u2019s reward for myself!\u201d\u201cElders, attack!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 - BetrayalPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAt Qi Ganglie\u2019s order, the nine elders pounced. The tremendous pressure had the Song siblings frozen in panic, unable to move an inch. Yet Zhuo Fan smiled as he flipped the table.Boom!Among the splinters, there was no shadow of Zhuo Fan around.The elders looked around in a daze.\u201cHe-he-he, here I am!\u201dThe ridicule came from behind. They didn\u2019t even have time to turn as an elder\u2019s skull blew up in a spray of blood and gore.Zhuo Fan dusted a piece off his hand as he jeered, \u201cThe first!\u201dThe elders were speechless from the show of strength Zhuo Fan displayed. He was in the same stage as them and was attacked from every direction, yet he still managed to pull off a kill.\u201cThe rumors were true, you really are a monster. No wonder seventh elder died at your hands.\u201d Qi Ganglie\u2019s eyes shivered as he watched Zhuo Fan in fear.Zhuo Fan looked down on him with a smile, \u201cAnd you chose to attack anyway! Hell Valley can\u2019t hold me and you think you have what it takes?\u201d\u201cHe-he-he, fortune favors the bold. The bigger the danger, the greater the reward.\u201d Qi Ganglie grinned as he charged with a crazed look. An image of a tiger appeared behind him as he charged.\u201cMid spirit ranked martial art, Tiger Fist!\u201dRoar!The tiger\u2019s image superimposed on Qi Ganglie\u2019s movements, but Zhuo Fan stood there with a sneer and punched out.Bam!The noise was jarring to the ears and the Song siblings were forced to curl up on the ground while hugging their heads.The tiger pushed Zhuo Fan ten meters back, his legs leaving two trails in the floor while the tiger itself turned into golden motes of energy and died out.Then a blood-curdling scream resounded as Qi Ganglie\u2019s hand was split open.\u201cClan Head!\u201d The elders cried out in panic, yet the man only had eyes for Zhuo Fan, watching him in fear.[God dammit, what kind of freak is he? How is he so damn hard?]From their exchange, he knew he had the upper hand in terms of Yuan Qi, but Zhuo Fan\u2019s body was as hard as a rock as if it was freakin\u2019 refined to be a spiritual weapon!\u201cWhat the hell are you?\u201d Qi Ganglie panted, \u201cYou\u2019re no human!\u201dSmirking, Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes gleamed with savagery, \u201cRegardless, it doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201dHe then took a step forward, Mystifying Phantom Step!He appeared before three elders and struck before they could react, burying his fist into their chests.The elders were still baffled as to what happened to their Clan Head\u2019s hand, but now they finally figured out this little devil was inhuman.Where could one find a man who could casually punch through three Bone Tempering experts?The Song siblings were dumbstruck. Although they had some semblance of knowledge about Zhuo Fan\u2019s abilities, this went beyond their wildest imaginations. Zhuo Fan\u2019s power allowed him to be in control despite surrounded by experts, even squashing them like bugs.This was absolute power!Everyone present there looked at him with grave faces and terrified minds.\u201cZhuo Fan, I was rash and overconfident in provoking you. Please, on account of Qian\u2019er and Xiao Yu, let us go and we will never cross paths again.\u201dQi Ganglie knew the matter was only going to get worse and capitulated. However, Zhuo Fan wasn\u2019t someone who was soft when it came to punishing his enemies. He mocked, \u201cQi Clan Head, I warned you to think twice about the consequences. And as for those two\u2026\u201dZhuo Fan turned to the siblings, \u201cSince when do traitors have any value? Qi Ganglie, are you looking down on me, or do you really expect too much from them?\u201dSong Qian and Song Yu felt deep regret.\u201cLuo, uhm, no, brother Zhuo, we were forced to do it, please\u2026\u201d\u201cTalk is cheap.\u201d Zhuo Fan cut off Song Qian with his frosty tone, \u201cActions are louder than words. Leave! And make sure we never meet again.\u201dPursing her lips, Song Qian hung her head in regret while Song Yu sighed.Qi Ganglie saw Zhuo Fan unwilling to compromise and blew a gasket, \u201cZhuo Fan, you will regret pitting yourself against my entire clan!\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m looking forward to it. Can you take me down with you?\u201d Zhuo Fan sneered.Qi Ganglie\u2019s face alternated between green and white, spatting through gritted teeth, \u201cElders, altogether!\u201d\u201cYes, Clan Head!\u201dThe remaining five elders jumped at Zhuo Fan in unison, each of them resigned to death, executing their best moves.Zhuo Fan knew they wanted to exchange their lives for his, but it mattered little. With a crackle, lightning flashed and his wings unfolded, flying around them.The five elders\u2019 moves hadn\u2019t even finished before they were split in two, splattering the ground in blood and painting it red.\u201cHumph, barely worth the effort.\u201d Zhuo Fan scoffed.Whoosh!Suddenly, a faint streak of blue rushed at Zhuo Fan.Zhuo Fan discovered Qi Ganglie sporting a sly grin. He used the elders as bait in releasing his true killing move, this dagger.[You think you can beat me with this lousy trick?] Zhuo Fan sneered as he flew. Yet just then, a tender cry followed by a graceful figure came right before him.\u201cWatch out!\u201dFollowing a grunt, blood splattered, and Song Qian struggled to stand with black blood flowing from her mouth.\u201cSister!\u201dWith a wail, Song Yu rushed to catch her weak body. But Song Qian only had eyes for Zhuo Fan, working hard to muster the strength to look at him.\u201cForgive us, we didn\u2019t want it to come to this!\u201dZhuo Fan just sighed.\u201cDamn bitch, you ruined everything! I will kill you!\u201dHaving his plan thwarted, Qi Ganglie flew into a rage and charged at the siblings.Snorting, Zhuo Fan\u2019s wings flickered like swords.In a blink, Qi Ganglie stopped and fell to pieces, with blood and viscera oozing.The Qi clan experts were vanquished!Zhuo Fan then started inspecting Song Qian\u2019s wound. He noticed the dagger stuck in her shoulder, and black blood seeping around its blade.He pulled it out and frowned, \u201cIt\u2019s poisonous.\u201d\u201cPoison?\u201d Song Yu grew frantic and was close to tears, \u201cIt must be one of the Qi clan\u2019s poisons. I will check their stores to see if they have an antidote. Sister, you must hold on.\u201dSong Yu wiped his tears and left.\u201cWait!\u201d Zhuo Fan jumped to his feet to stop Song Yu but a frail hand caught his arm. He looked down at the pale Song Qian.\u201cDon\u2019t go!\u201d Song Qian\u2019s faint voice came.Zhuo Fan gave a curt nod and steadied her by placing his palm on her back, \u201cUh, I only wanted to tell your brother this poison can be removed with Yuan Qi.\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, he is always impulsive, unlike you\u2026\u201dA faint smile adorned Song Qian\u2019s wane face and her delicate hand touched his. A pair of glistening eyes locked his own in an unshakable gaze that unnerved Zhuo Fan. He felt as if they were back in the carriage.Worried about her state, he rushed to clear the poison.However, when his Yuan Qi entered her body he found a problem, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I find its source?\u201dThis hardly ever happened. Based on his experience, there were two reasons. One, because she never got poisoned, and two, this type of poison couldn\u2019t be sensed with Yuan Qi.He found Song Qian\u2019s health deteriorating and came to a decision.Since Yuan Qi was useless, the second method implied drawing out the poison.But the wound\u2019s close position to her chest made it hard not to encroach upon her dignity.[This will make it terribly awkward\u2026]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88 - TrapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cW-what is it?\u201d Song Qian found Zhuo Fan making an odd expression and asked.After muttering to himself, Zhuo Fan spoke, \u201cUhm, that is, the only choice is to suck the poison out\u2026\u201dSong Qian understood from his hesitation and her pale face was tinted pink.\u201cThen, sorry to trouble you\u2026\u201d Song Qian\u2019s soft voice rang hard in his ears. The delicate and charming look would stir anyone\u2019s sympathy.Licking his dry lips, Zhuo Fan ripped her clothes around the wound and exposed her fair skin.Song Qian shuddered as she closed her eyes with a red face. She knew what was about to happen, but when her clothes tore, she still gasped.\u201cThen, a thousand pardons, miss Song.\u201d Zhuo Fan forced a smile in this awkward situation and neared his mouth to the wound, beginning to draw the poison out.But the longer he sucked the more doubts sprouted. [Why is the blood spicy? Why is Song Qian\u2019s blood normal, as if she wasn\u2019t poisoned to begin with?]However, he pushed aside all conflicting thoughts and kept sucking to make sure she was out of harm\u2019s way, that is, until her blood turned scarlet again.\u201cI\u2019ve taken most of the poison out, so there should be no problems.\u201d Zhuo Fan let out a breath he was holding, but his eyes were clouded with more doubts.Then, a smoking hot body hugged him and two tender arms curled around his neck.Zhuo Fan was startled, \u201cMiss Song, what\u2026\u201dSong Qian\u2019s hot breath entered his ear, \u201cZhuo Fan, do you know? I liked you the moment I saw you.\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s eyes darted left and right, his tone wavering, \u201cMiss Song, your brother will be here soon\u2026\u201d\u201cNever mind him.\u201d Song Qian\u2019s tongue left a trail on his cheek, making him feel as if a bolt of lightning had struck him, \u201cI only want you next to me!\u201dShe didn\u2019t give him the chance to put up any resistance as she drew his head into a hot kiss.As his eyes grew lost, his heart was thoroughly shocked and his mind blanked.He reached the Demonic Emperor level because he always had cultivation in his mind, taking into account every step, every detail. So much so, he had overlooked the matters between a man and a woman.When Luo Yunchang and Lei Yuting stole a peck, it floored him, but this time, his mind was literally blown.[Damn it, I was born twice and a virgin each time, but never did I come upon such a battle!]Then, Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes flared with irritation and pushed Song Qian away, \u201cWhat did you just give me?\u201dIn his daze, he could still feel something entering his mouth and dissolving.Song Qian cried as she hit the ground, then a burst of laughter echoed around him, \u201cHa-ha-ha, something marvelous, I\u2019m sure.\u201dA black figure appeared and threw a large transparent bell over Zhuo Fan.Zhuo Fan exclaimed, \u201c4th-grade defensive spiritual weapon?\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, indeed. This is the Qi clan\u2019s treasure, Violet Canopy!\u201dThe black figure landed in front of Zhuo Fan and revealed itself to be an aged man. His eyes were filled with glee and rancor.\u201cYou\u2019re the Qi clan\u2019s Profound Heaven expert?\u201d Zhuo Fan tried to get up but his head swooned, falling back to his knees.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Am I poisoned?\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, that\u2019s a powerful toxin of the Qi clan, Soul Devourer!\u201d The old man mocked, \u201cIt targets one\u2019s soul and no one beneath Radiant Stage can last more than two hours. Even they will die three days later without our antidote!\u201dZhuo Fan frowned.The old man saw through him and cackled, \u201cYou must be wondering how you got poisoned? He-he-he, let me tell you. The dagger wasn\u2019t poisoned, it was only dabbed in something to change the blood\u2019s color. The true poison was on Qian\u2019er\u2019s shoulder, which you were more than happy to suck out.\u201dTwo more figures walked next to Song Qian at this moment, Song Yu and Qi Tianlei. Song Qian and Song Yu appeared to be eaten by guilt, avoiding Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes. But Qi Tianlei stared right at him through the cover he was in, with deep-seethed hatred.\u201cYou killed my dad. I will tie you to horses and have you ripped to pieces.\u201d\u201cHumph, I\u2019ve seen my fair share of dishonorable old goats, but your Qi clan\u2019s elders take the cake.\u201d Zhuo Fan jeered, \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, Qi Ganglie was the bait from the start, expecting me to kill him. In other words, you\u2019ve all given up on him from the get-go.\u201dHaving been exposed, Qi Tianlei was left speechless.But no matter how true it was, none of them would dare speak of it. Else he would earn the world\u2019s unanimous hatred and reviled gazes when word got out that a rotten son like him threw his father to the wolves all so he could snatch a bounty.\u201cHumph, who are you trying to deceive?\u201dZhuo Fan sneered at the old man, \u201cYou sure know how to play a big hand, using the Clan Head and nine elders as small fries.\u201dThe old man disregarded Zhuo Fan\u2019s jab with a laugh, \u201cAnd? I gave up my son, but I still have a grandson. It\u2019s all worth it for your head. Once we become Hell Valley\u2019s number one vassal clan, we can have as many elders as we want, we will be stronger than ever. This little loss is nothing compared to the future glory of the Qi clan!\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, that\u2019s how the ambitious act, shameless.\u201d Zhuo Fan praised, then derided them, \u201cBut in the end, that old mind of yours is too narrow. You\u2019re paying such a heavy price only to become Hell Valley\u2019s number one lap dog. You\u2019re bound to fail. If it were me, I would become the ruler of the continent with what you paid!\u201d[Is this kid nuts? Can you even grasp how large the Tianyu Empire is, not to mention the continent?][Just another loud mouth!]The old man sneered, \u201cNow I know why you are so reviled, so set against Hell Valley. You\u2019re clearly insane! How can one common man possibly rule the entire continent?\u201d\u201cHumph, what does an ant know of the human stepping on it?\u201dZhuo Fan shook his head and asked, \u201cOh, I forgot to mention, but I do dab in alchemy myself, you know? If her shoulder had poison on it, I would\u2019ve known.\u201d\u201cHe-he-he, I heard you killed You Guiqi. This speaks volumes of your own twisted mind for having fought him. You think we\u2019d use common poison when dealing with you?\u201dThe old man took on a haughty tone, \u201cSoul Devourer is a combination of two different medicines. One was on Qian\u2019er\u2019s shoulder and the other was the one you just swallowed.\u201d\u201cWas that what she made me take when she kissed me?\u201d\u201cPrecisely! That was also for her own safety. If she hadn\u2019t fed it to you, she\u2019d be the one dying.\u201dThe old man let out a manic grin, \u201cTo end you, I have scoured every bit of rumor and information about you, most of all about you sticking your head out for a little girl and offending Hell Valley. I know you\u2019re just one big softy inside. How ironic this came to be your downfall.\u201dZhuo Fan mocked himself, [Who knew my fight with You Guiqi was twisted into a hero saving a damsel.][Then again, it is true. Also, saving a woman was the first thing I did after I rebirthed, wasn\u2019t it?]Shaking his head, Zhuo Fan was this close to labeling himself a lecher, \u201cHey, old goat, you sure employ vicious schemes, no less than You Guiqi.\u201d\u201cWhy thank you.\u201d The old man stuck his chin out in pride, \u201cYou Guiqi only had the luck of the draw in being born in one of the seven houses. If I had such privilege, my achievements would\u2019ve dwarfed his. Do you know what I\u2019m called? Steel Fettering River, Qi Weilin, he-he-he\u2026\u201dZhuo Fan had a grin himself, \u201cSteel Fettering River, neither good nor bad. The one in your clutches can\u2019t beg for life, nor can die!\u201d\u201cPrecisely!\u201dQi Weilin laughed, speaking as if to a close friend, \u201cYou see, this is the first time you\u2019ve heard of me and you can already appreciate my title. No wonder you could beat You Guiqi. I would hate to remove that pretty head of yours, but too bad it\u2019s worth so much.\u201d\u201cThink you have what it takes to reap my head?\u201d Zhuo Fan mocked as his glabella lit up.Whoosh!An azure flame revealed itself along with a black smoke drifting out from it.The Soul Devourer was reduced to nothing before the power of this flame.Zhuo Fan took his time getting back to his feet and surveyed the people with killing intent, \u201cI told You Guiqi something when I killed him, and now I shall repeat it for you. In front of true power, all schemes and ploys are moot!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There\u2019s no way\u2026\u201dRoar!He didn\u2019t get the chance to finish his flimsy reasoning as a dragon roar echoed and a black light ran through his chest.With a jerk, Qi Weilin was left bleeding from his mouth.\u201cWhat\u2026 just happened?\u201d As Qi Weilin wiped the blood away, he felt his body growing colder. His life was seeping away yet he couldn\u2019t understand why.He looked towards Qi Tianlei and the Song siblings only to find them staring at his chest. Qi Weilin looked down and discovered a fist-sized black hole spurting blood.He noticed an identical hole at his back too. It was as if something had burrowed through his chest.\u201cHow did\u2026 this happen\u2026\u201d Qi Weilin couldn\u2019t comprehend what had happened even on the brink of his death. But when he looked at Zhuo Fan, his eyes narrowed.Zhuo Fan was gasping beneath the Violet Canopy after using close to half of his energy, but his hand was still in the form of a dragon claw.It just so happened that there was also a fist-sized hole in the canopy, aligned with his chest.Only now did the horror and dread of what transpired got to Qi Weilin, \u201cMonster! To force your way through a 4th-grade spiritual weapon\u2026 with only\u2026 your\u2026 body strength\u2026\u201dBam!His body hit the ground hard, his eyes were still shocked and incredulous of what came to pass.Zhuo Fan killed him in an instant despite being trapped!Not even a Profound Heaven expert could display such power if they were in Zhuo Fan\u2019s place.[He\u2026 is an abomination that will end my clan\u2026]Along with the fear Qi Weilin felt, there was now endless regret\u2026\u201cAh!\u201d Song Qian cried in terror while fleeing. Qi Tianlei and Song Yu\u2019s knees softened, shivering all the while they ran alongside her.Gasping, Zhuo Fan showed a vile smile of delight.Wraith Style 2nd move, Ghostly Dragon Claw!Among the profound ranked martial arts, Zhuo Fan could only employ one move fully, yet it still sapped half of his strength.[But the power makes it all worth it!]The Wraith Style was suited to a body cultivator, the stronger the body, the more outrageous the blows. However, the end result exceeded Zhuo Fan\u2019s imagination. It was a perfect match for his 5th-grade demonic treasure body!At first, he only thought of giving it a shot in breaking the 4th-grade spiritual weapon. Yet the result showed that the spiritual weapon was like paper in front of the Ghostly Dragon Claw.\u201cHe-he-he, I was right in my course of action. Since my freaky body refining worked, a stronger martial art was only fitting.\u201d Zhuo Fan revealed a radiant smile.Then, his wings whipped out with a flurry.Rumble!The broken Violet Canopy turned to pieces and Zhuo Fan eyed the trio in the distance with coldness. His wings flapped and he was on them in seconds.He then blocked their retreat and the trio stumbled to the ground with pale faces.\u201cGo ahead, run!\u201d Zhuo Fan\u2019s vile smile was a prelude to the horror that followed, \u201cLet\u2019s see who\u2019s faster, me or you?\u201d\u201cY-young master Zhuo, the Qi clan was blind not to see your greatness. You killed my grandfather and my dad, please let me go.\u201dQi Tianlei was so scared by Zhuo Fan\u2019s twisted grin that he was pounding the ground with his forehead, all the while shedding bitter tears.Zhuo Fan gave a faint smile and hoisted him by his neck, \u201cNow that you said it, it\u2019s best I kill you too, to accompany them in death.\u201dBlack tendrils left Zhuo Fan and burrowed into Qi Tianlei. In but seconds, Qi Tianlei was turned to dust, scattered to the four winds.The Song siblings were close to having a mental breakdown witnessing such a gruesome murder.Zhuo Fan smiled, \u201cIs there anything you want to say at this point?\u201dIn the end, it was Song Qian who spoke through trembling lips, \u201cBrother Zhuo, we were compelled. The Song clan is a minor clan and can\u2019t offend even the Qi clan. Let my life douse your anger, but please leave the Song clan our last heir.\u201d\u201cSister!\u201dSong Yu\u2019s tears flowed unabated as Song Qian looked at him with tenderness.Zhuo Fan shook his head with a mutter, \u201cYou are just like them, with your clan in dire straits, and compelled to lower yourself\u2026\u201dHe then turned around and looked at the wide sky with a sigh, \u201cI wonder what they are doing right now? Wonder if my actions brought them more hardships\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you speaking of\u2026 Luo clan?\u201d Song Qian ventured.Zhuo Fan smiled, \u201cIndeed. You are so much alike that it makes it hard for me to do this\u2026\u201dThe siblings broke out a faint smile, but then came Zhuo Fan\u2019s cold tone, \u201cSuch a pity, there is one part you are different in\u2026\u201dWhoosh!Zhuo Fan\u2019s wings whipped and the siblings\u2019 heads traveled through the air before plopping on the ground.What made it even eerier was the faint smile of forlorn hope.\u201cYou two are far shrewder.\u201d Zhuo Fan jeered, \u201cYou two knew from where I come from and enacted such a heartfelt play thinking I was a moron. This is where you diverge from their demeanor, ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201dZhuo Fan left, uncaring of the corpses or the consequences, not even of the wails coming from the Qi clan\u2019s home.A month later.Three figures landed in the Qi clan\u2019s manor. They were dressed in gray and their leader was Hell Valley\u2019s second elder.He watched everything with a calculative eye and muttered, \u201cHow come the Qi clan is so quiet?\u201d\u201cHumph, they have the nerve to say that they have clues about the runt and when we come, there\u2019s no one here at all.\u201d Another elder curse, \u201cWhat is a mere second-rate clan trying to pull?\u201dSecond elder huffed and then shouted, \u201cNo, there\u2019s something wrong here. Third elder, Fourth elder, check the surroundings.\u201dMoments after they left, a cry came from the back of Qi clan\u2019s manor, \u201cSecond elder, third elder, come and take a look at this.\u201dBoth of them appeared in a blink, but the sight left them speechless.What used to be a garden was now a cemetery housing a thousand dead bodies in a towering pile. The rot assaulted their noses and painted an even gruesome picture with the swarm of flies around it.\u201cThat punk is savage. He killed the whole Qi clan.\u201d Second elder spat.The other two were overwhelmed by the image of a kid ripping apart fleeing people and came to realize they were a far cry from his level when it came to viciousness.Such cold-blooded slaughter of an entire clan only came from offending the Tianyu Empire or the seven houses.Second elder grew frantic, \u201cElders, handle the corpses so that no one finds out about this.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cFool, if anyone comes to know of the dread this runt can instill, who else will muster the nerve to search for him?\u201d Second elder cursed, \u201cHumph, Qi Weilin liked to flaunt himself as an equal for our seventh elder. He must\u2019ve planned on taking the kid down all by himself and earning the reward. Look at what greed does to people.\u201d\u201cOverconfident fool!\u201d Scoffing, second elder left as a towering flame rose behind him. It swallowed the manor and the corpses, leaving only the ashes of the renowned Qi clan.An elder gazed upon the raging fire and asked, \u201cSecond elder, what now?\u201d\u201cWe separate!\u201d The look in second elder\u2019s eyes hardened, \u201cThe three of us will go different ways. One of us is sure to be on the right track.\u201d\u201cWhat about the fourth direction?\u201d The elder frowned, \u201cIf not for Grand Elder being in seclusion, the four of us would have been enough.\u201dSecond elder shook his head, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to concern ourselves with that direction. It leads to Drifting Flowers City. If the brat dares to step foot in it, he\u2019ll have to face the fifth elder.\u201dThen he flew away. The other two elders also picked a direction and left.What was left behind was a desolate and eerie place, void of people. So came to pass the number one clan in Orchid City, destroyed to the roots\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If the Qi clan\u2019s recently departed ghosts were here, they\u2019d be shocked to the core.Wasn\u2019t this their carriage? Wasn\u2019t the youth Song Yu? Didn\u2019t he die?However, there was one thing out of place. This youth had a devious grin on his face, enough to scare the most wretched ghosts.His smile closely resembled that demon who annihilated their entire Qi clan.\u201cHooo!\u201dThe youth reined in the horses as he gazed to the distance, at the three words emblazoned on the gate, Drifting Flowers City!\u201cI\u2019m here at last. I hope this place has life-saving herbs, or it would be a true waste of time coming here.\u201d The youth grinned as he snapped the reigns.But a shout delayed him, \u201cStop!\u201dFollowing the yell, six people appeared around him. The youth gave them a once-over and rose an eyebrow, \u201cHell Valley?\u201d\u201cOh, quite perceptive. You recognize us?\u201d The leader scrutinized the youth in amazement, \u201cFrom the way you look, you seem like some clan\u2019s young master. State your name.\u201dThe youth asked in puzzlement, \u201cShouldn\u2019t Drifting Flowers City be managed by Drifting Flowers Edifice? Why\u2026\u201d\u201cCut the chat!\u201d A cursing voice cut him off, \u201cHurry it up before I lose my patience. If this place didn\u2019t belong to Drifting Flowers Edifice, I would\u2019ve killed you just from you being so slow on the uptake.\u201dThe youth frowned, his eyes flashing with killing intent before suppressing it, \u201cI am Song Yu and hail from Nightrain City\u2019s Song clan. Father commanded me to participate in the Hundred Pill Meeting, this is my clan\u2019s seal.\u201dHe fished out an engraved jade from his bosom. The leader looked over it and nodded. Meanwhile, his men rummaged through the carriage and they too nodded.\u201cFine, you can go. But if you catch sight of this man, notify us at once.\u201d The man gave the youth a sidelong glance as he handed over a roll of paper before leaving. Once the men were out of sight, the youth regarded the unfolded paper with a sneer.It was the Hell Kill Order on Zhuo Fan along with an impeccable drawing of his features. On the bottom of the paper, rewards were stated. Anyone who provided clues to his whereabouts could become a vassal to Hell Valley, and whoever brings his head could become the foremost among all of Hell Valley\u2019s vassal clans.\u201cHumph, they really can\u2019t see beyond their nose. How can you find someone you don\u2019t even recognize?\u201d He mocked as he rolled the kill order into a ball before throwing it away.Indeed, this youth was Zhuo Fan!After damning the Qi clan, he was aware that everyone in the Tianyu Empire would be privy to his face. So he refined a little pill that turned him into Song Yu and resumed his way to Drifting Flowers City.This would work wonders in searching for treasures unperturbed by narrow-minded fools. And wearing the Song clan young master\u2019s identity would also leave Hell Valley grasping straws.As he entered the city he realized how grand it was, a perfect match for the headquarters of Drifting Flowers Edifice. It was a city, true, but it was ten times more expansive than an average city.By contrast, Windgaze City and Blue Expanse City looked like towns. Especially when it came to the people on the streets. There were many young masters of clans wondering about, but the difference was they were all from first-rate clans. These young heirs were more important than the Clan Head or elders of a third-rate clan.This made the third-rate young master, whom Zhuo Fan was impersonating, look like a beggar.With a bitter smile, he snapped the reins for picking up speed. He\u2019d best find lodgings fast or he\u2019d feel dwarfed in this crowd.He assumed that posing as Song Yu was a walk in the park. But now that he got here, he knew that third-rate clansmen were a rarity as most of the people in the city were from the second and first-rate clans.[Instead of blending in, I became the odd one out!]Zhuo Fan\u2019s carriage creaked down the street before finally stopping in front of a tavern.\u201cOwner, do you have a room available?\u201d Zhuo Fan asked the man at the counter. The man looked up, then returned to counting his profit.[Hey, now you really aren\u2019t looking beyond your nose!]Zhuo Fan was getting irate fast and slapped the counter as he roared, \u201cDo you have a room or not? You think I don\u2019t have the coin for it?\u201dLooking up at him again, the owner said in a laid-back manner, \u201cShow me the clan seal.\u201dZhuo Fan was a bit shocked at this. [Even a shop owner asks for it now?] But he still chose to take it out.The owner got one look at it and jeered, \u201cYeah, just the Song clan, a third-rate clan.\u201d\u201cAnd what\u2019s wrong with that? Didn\u2019t you open this establishment to make money? Are mine unwelcome here?\u201dShaking his head, the owner patted Zhuo Fan\u2019s shoulder, and impersonating a wise sage, he counseled, \u201cYoung man, there\u2019s a run-down hut three miles out. It won\u2019t charge you a dime!\u201dZhuo Fan blinked in shock, then rage burned in his eyes, \u201cOwner, even I know those are the slums. Even if I come from a third-rate clan, I am still a guest in your tavern and should be treated as one.\u201dThe owner sighed but didn\u2019t pay him any more heed.Then sudden laughter drifted over.\u201cHa-ha-ha, Song Yu, you hick! You came for the Hundred Pill Meeting without even knowing the rules of Drifting Flowers City?\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s heart seized, [How come the first place I visit, someone ends up recognizing Song Yu?]He saw a flashy young master coming down the stairs with four elders in tow, Bone Tempering experts. That person himself was at the 5th layer of Bone Tempering Stage.On his left was a cute young lady, not a beauty but one worthy of appreciation. But the lady only looked at Zhuo Fan with despise.Zhuo Fan narrowed his eyes as his mind was going a mile a minute in his curses, [Damn brat, you got what you deserved. I spent half a month traveling with you yet you didn\u2019t say anything about the ones you know here. I should\u2019ve seen this coming.]In any case, the young master saw Zhuo Fan keyed up and laughed, \u201cBrat, are you still a scaredy-cat? No wonder my little sister doesn\u2019t like you!\u201dAs if on cue, the lady snorted.Zhuo Fan licked his dry lips in embarrassment and said, \u201cUh, brother is quite right. Since you do not welcome me, I shall leave.\u201d\u201cHey, wait!\u201dJust as Zhuo Fan was planning on leaving, the young master called out to him, his face tinted in suspicion, \u201cStrange, something is off with you today. What brother this and that, why are you calling me in such an odd way?\u201dZhuo Fan secretly cursed his bad luck, thinking he was exposed. If that happened Hell Valley would come storming in and his plans would go up in smoke.All the more reason he was itching to snap this punk\u2019s neck.\u201cOh, right.\u201d The young master interrupted his inner cursing by coming up with a seamless explanation, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re still mad that Wan\u2019er turned down your marriage proposal and ruined your self-esteem. Are you so petty to be still brooding over it after all this time?\u201dWhen he heard this, Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes sparkled and his heart leaped. It was as if he was grasping straws while drowning and finally found purchase.He instantly changed his demeanor and faked anger, \u201cHumph, don\u2019t mention it then! We are done here! I don\u2019t want to see you guys ever again.\u201d\u201cSigh, this is where you are wrong. Why are you dragging me into yours and my sister\u2019s problems?\u201dThe young master shook his head, then his eyes shifted as he said in an understanding tone, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we are close as brothers, lifting our spears together and together\u2026 he-he-he\u2026\u201dThis, Zhuo Fan understood perfectly. [The way he looks, he must be a second-rate clan\u2019s young master. How did Song Yu get to befriend him? And by the looks of things, they\u2019re buddy-buddy too.][Then again, this might not be so bad.]Zhuo Fan\u2019s lascivious smile mimicked his, \u201cHe-he-he, a real man doesn\u2019t boast about his past glory. You don\u2019t need to say it!\u201d\u201cWhat? I last longer than you by far. I can take eight rounds while you only five\u2026\u201d The young master then made an obvious gesture towards Zhuo Fan. If not for his sister\u2019s presence, he\u2019d be going in much more gory details, \u201cSigh, those three days and three nights were a bliss.\u201dZhuo Fan saw his intoxicated face and adjusted accordingly. Though the lady there stated her disagreement with her disgusted reply, \u201cGross!\u201dShe then proceeded to walk out of the tavern and let the two perverts to their vile imagination\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This worked to Zhuo Fan\u2019s advantage, finding all the particularities regarding Song Yu\u2019s past.Dong Tianba belonged to an average-sized town\u2019s leading clan, considered a second-rate clan in the empire, but far stronger than the Song clan.Not too long ago, Dong Tianba\u2019s father sent him on business to Nightrain City, where this young master hit it right off with the dastardly Song Yu. The moment Song Yu found that his friend was from a second-rate clan, he took it in stride, drinking and going to pleasure houses, not forgetting to act the haughty part that deigned his new position, and all of this alongside his friend. It went so far that Dong Tianba was even planning on giving his sister\u2019s, Dong Xiaowan, hand in marriage to Song Yu.Song Yu was close to going crazy from joy as that was the greatest gift any from the Song clan would want. As all was set and done, he went straight to proposing.Unfortunately, Dong Xiaowan was the only daughter of the Dong clan, the apple of her grandfather\u2019s eye, so how could he let Dong Tianba decide her fate? As a result, when his grandfather found Song Yu\u2019s social standing, his dastardly moral talent, the grandfather catapulted him out of his home and even rebuked his grandson.As for Dong Xiaowan, she never forgave her dear elder brother for bringing up such a proposal. [I am your sister and you want to throw me to that pig?][He is a greedy slacker!]While the Dong clan saw Song Yu for what he was, a sorry excuse of a man, Dong Tianba found him as his dearest of friends, going out with every chance he got.[What greedy slacker? He is true to himself, unlike those hypocritical gentlemen.] Dong Tianba recalled that encounter with a smile, feeling he let down his dear friend in Nightrain City.It was also thanks to him for having notified the Song clan of the Hundred Pill Meeting that they sent Song Yu to the gathering. He hoped Song Yu would use this chance to climb the ranks and dismiss the Dong clan\u2019s despising glances.With a bit of luck, the Song clan would be under Drifting Flowers Edifice\u2019s care and the Dong clan would have nothing to say if he asked for Dong Xiaowan\u2019s hand again.Zhuo Fan gave a bitter smile at the side. [This is one odd elder brother! The rotten Song Yu just invited him to a drink a couple of times and he is ready to throw his sister in the former\u2019s lap. If I were the Dong grandfather, I would\u2019ve tanned his rear to a paste.][Furthermore, how come you push your sister on others you like while you yourself are unmarried?]Zhuo Fan shook his head, worried over the happiness of the Dong clan and Dong Tianba\u2019s sister. Even the four elders behind them were red-faced with humiliation from having such a weirdo for a young master.They even looked around at times to make sure no one heard him!Zhuo Fan sighed, [Birds of a feather flock together.]\u201cBro Song!\u201dDong Tianba beckoned him with a strange smile, \u201cWhere\u2019s your sister?\u201dZhuo Fan replied, \u201cShe left after bringing me here. I made sure to personally see her off.\u201dHe had an ineffable smile when he said \u2018personally\u2019. But it went over Dong Tianba\u2019s head who was downcast.\u201cAnd I really wanted to gaze upon miss Song one more time. I would\u2019ve long sent the dowry if not for my old man refusing to have anything to do with your clan.\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, the world houses countless beauties, bro Dong needn\u2019t \u2018hang\u2019 on just one.\u201d Zhuo Fan smiled, \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t deserve you. Look around, there are countless girls in Drifting Flowers City to feast your eyes on.\u201d\u201cSigh, bro Song, you wouldn\u2019t understand. You can\u2019t touch any of the girls here!\u201dDong Tianba made sure no one was around before whispering, \u201cDon\u2019t you know that the Drifting Flowers Edifice is unique among the seven houses for only having women? For a thousand years, they had men marry into their house. This is a place where women reign.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean you can\u2019t even chase girls?\u201dDong Tianba had a deep look this time, \u201cBro, how come I feel like I know you less and less? Don\u2019t you know chasing and harassing have different meanings?\u201dZhuo Fan laughed in dismay, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re absolutely right. Bro Dong is a genius.\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, we both are. Didn\u2019t we use to swap pointers? How could you forget? Must be from the blow my sister\u2019s refusal gave you that you succumbed to your vices.\u201dZhuo Fan nodded repeatedly. Dong Tianba was an oddball, but quite true to others. Talking with him all this time made Zhuo Fan feel at ease.\u201cBy the way, brother Dong, what other rules are there? Like this tavern\u2026\u201d\u201cAlmost forgot.\u201d Dong Tianba spoke in a heavy tone, \u201cBecause of the massive influx of people throughout the Hundred Pill Meeting, the Drifting Flowers Edifice has laid some rules regarding lodging. The third-rate clans are to stay in the poor district, the second-rate clans in the taverns and the first-rate clans are welcomed by the 15 Floor Keepers. The Seven Noble Houses\u2026\u201d\u201cThere are people from the Seven Noble Houses here?\u201d Zhuo Fan raised a question.Dong Tianba nodded, \u201cThat is only natural. The seven houses might be plotting and scheming among each other, but Drifting Flowers Edifice is neutral. It is expected for two-three houses to be here, welcomed personally by the Edifice Lord. At the very least, Hell Valley is certain to be here.\u201dZhuo Fan gasped.That explained the Hell Valley\u2019s disciples at the gate. They weren\u2019t purposely placed in every city for searching him in particular, but because they followed someone important from their house to participate in the Hundred Pill Meeting.The one who must be representing Hell Valley had to be an elder, or maybe their Valley Lord\u2026\u201cWho came from Hell Valley?\u201d Zhuo Fan asked frantically.Wrinkling his brows, Dong Tianba shook his head. But then a man burst through the door huffing, \u201cYoung master, the young miss is in trouble!\u201dDong Tianba jumped to his feet and rushed with the four elders. Zhuo Fan was right behind them!They arrived at a market. There were many people standing at the sideline in silence.A fine and charming lady stood in front of a stall, holding a delicate piece of jewelry. Her phoenix eyes darted towards the crying woman on the ground.Dong Xiaowan\u2019s cheeks were swollen as tears streamed her stinging face. Anyone there would realize she was slapped, and not just once or twice.Dong Tianba hurried to help his sister as he roared, \u201cXiaowan, what happened? Who did this?\u201d\u201cBrother, let\u2019s just go!\u201d Dong Xiaowan held in her sobs while taking a side-glance at the stuck up lady in red.\u201cWho said you can leave?\u201d The lady said with malice. Her sharp eyes stabbed like swords and made Dong Xiaowan shiver, \u201cI told you to slap yourself a hundred times. Aren\u2019t you skipping some from thirty?\u201d\u201cNo matter who you think you are, I can make your whole clan burn if I want to!\u201dCrestfallen and shivering, Dong Xiaowan started slapping herself and her already swollen face began growing redder and bulgier along with the tears of humiliation.Dong Tianba grabbed her hands and snapped, \u201cXiaowan, stop! Why are you doing this?\u201d\u201cBrother, it\u2019s all my fault.\u201d Dong Xiaowan cried, \u201cI wanted to buy that item, but she\u2026\u201dDong Tianba heard it clearly even if her voice trailed off. He turned his flaming eyes of rage to the lady in red, \u201cI get that you wanted to take the jewelry from my sister\u2019s hand, but why do you have to be so heavy-handed?\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, I asked her politely, but she kept being rude to me and didn\u2019t know what\u2019s good for her.\u201d The lady mocked and threw the jewelry to the ground in spite, \u201cNow I lost all interest in it. So how can I not teach her manners for this?\u201dThe lady\u2019s naked contempt made Dong Tianba spit words through gritted teeth, \u201cBitch, I will make you regret this, or my name isn\u2019t Dong Tianba.\u201dHe then went charging over. With how the lady was but in the 9th layer of Qi Condensation, his power was more than enough to deal with her.Unfortunately, a gale stopped him as a white figure flashed in front of him.Bam!The noise echoed around as Dong Tianba was sent flying into the air and in his previous place landed a handsome youth in white, fanning himself; 7th layer of Bone Tempering Stage.Such a disciple was considered the cream of the crop among the seven houses.Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyelid trembled and his feet moved.Dong Tianba and his four elders were nowhere near enough to deal with the newcomer. If he was impassive, this pair of siblings would experience a world of hurt today.But if he did act, he would earn a world of trouble, affecting his plans.But this bitch was too ruthless, she was asking for a beating. Not even he, a Demonic Emperor, could take this lying down.When all was said and done, some things couldn\u2019t be held in. This was his demonic path\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She, on the other hand, had only naked disdain for the Dong clan, \u201cNothing of importance, just some blind dogs yapping at my feet.\u201d\u201cOh, they must be truly ignorant to offend Peony Edifice\u2019s grand miss Xiao, ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201d The youth mocked.His words caused widespread shock, especially to Dong Tianba, \u201cWhat? The Peony Edifice? Belonging to the Drifting Flowers Edifice?\u201dDong Tianba looked towards his terrified sister in a daze.That was why his sister was so set on bearing this humiliation. No one from the Seven Noble Houses could be offended, or one\u2019s entire clan would go extinct.\u201cWan\u2019er, how\u2026\u201d Dong Tianba sighed at his tear-stained sister, feeling how wronged she was.Xiao Dandan couldn\u2019t care less for their plight and glared at Dong Tianba, \u201cWeren\u2019t you about to hit me? Well, what\u2019s stopping you?\u201dDong Tianba\u2019s body shivered and started to regret his transgression, \u201cI was at fault for not noticing your grandeur and offending miss in my rash action. Please pardon me!\u201d\u201cPardon, how are you guilty?\u201d Xiao Dandan sneered, \u201cYou just said that I coveted your sister\u2019s item and then humiliated her. Sticking out for her is only normal, but do you have the strength to back it up?\u201dGnashing his teeth, Dong Tianba cupped his hands, \u201cMiss\u2019 lesson is that I am powerless and still dared to strike!\u201dHe then slapped himself six times and his face swelled. The people around shook their heads. Stumbling upon any from the seven houses was bound to bring humiliation to your entire clan.\u201cHumph, such filth, not in the least bit entertaining.\u201dXiao Dandan grinned, \u201cWhy are men such cowards, lacking the basic mettle to stand tall?\u201dThen, she came up with a great idea that brought a smile to her lips, \u201cBrother Tianyu, why not have some fun with him?\u201d\u201cDandan, what are you suggesting?\u201d The youth in white smiled.With a sweet smile, Xiao Dandan replied, \u201cThis kid must be quite fond of his sister. You\u2019re quite able in martial arts and such an understanding character, so this should be convenient for you. If you can shred that girl\u2019s clothes under the protection of those five Bone Tempering experts, she\u2019s yours to indulge in. The Drifting Flowers Edifice will even turn a blind eye.\u201dWhat?Dong Xiaowan shivered and Dong Tianba\u2019s eyes were bloodshot!This was no longer picking on others, but disgracing. Even if they were from the seven houses, this was something the common people wouldn\u2019t stand for.Yet the youth in white waved her proposal off, \u201cDandan, you\u2019ve gravely misunderstood me. I come from Merry Woods, but that doesn\u2019t imply that I\u2019m lecherous. You\u2019re making it hard for me to accomplish your request, ha-ha-ha\u2026 \u201c\u201cYour expression doesn\u2019t seem to be saying so. Fine, I don\u2019t mind it at all. So what are you worried about? I\u2019ll be yours next July anyway. You\u2019ll still get to join the Drifting Flowers Edifice regardless.\u201dThe youth in white rose an eyebrow then turned an appreciative eye over Dong Xiaowan, \u201cHe-he-he, since Dandan requests it, I must comply. But keep in mind, this is only a game, so don\u2019t go settle the score later.\u201d\u201cDespicable!\u201d Xiao Dandan rose the corner of her mouth.The youth in white walked towards Dong Xiaowan, who shivered at each of his steps.\u201cHa-ha-ha, I am Lin Tianyu of Merry Woods, a future son-in-law of Drifting Flowers Edifice. As you heard, I\u2019m not lecherous and an insufferable bully, it is you who offended my future wife and have to be punished for your transgression.\u201d\u201cYoung master Lin!\u201dDong Tianba said in pain, \u201cI am well aware of miss\u2019 game and I would like to know if, by some fluke, we can stop your advance.\u201dLin Tianyu just let out a mocking laughter and Xiao Dandan replied instead, \u201cIf you can, then this matter will end here and we shall never have anything to do with each other.\u201d\u201cThen please forgive this offense!\u201d Dong Tianba roared and his eyes were filled with fighting spirit, having heard what he wanted.Yet Lin Tianyu\u2019s contempt only grew, \u201cGood eyes, but\u2026\u201dWhoosh!A figure flitted by and Lin Tianyu was already behind Dong Xiaowan. His hand even held the delicate clothes of the latter.\u201cToo bad you\u2019re so weak!\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d Dong Xiaowan cried as she covered her shoulder in tears. She was wearing five articles of clothing, and one was gone just like that, revealing the white and delicate skin beneath.Dong Tianba turned in shock.Lin Tianyu\u2019s speed was incredible!But Zhuo Fan only smirked. [This kid is in the 7th layer of Bone Tempering Stage but his power is only in the 6th layer. His focus must be on speed.]This was a typical case of putting the cart before the horse. No matter how fast you were, if you couldn\u2019t harm your opponent, it was useless. And he was already weaker than others by one layer.The more he\u2019d advance the more the gap would widen. To Zhuo Fan, such a cultivator was no different from a cripple.No wonder the Merry Woods sent him to marry into Drifting Flowers Edifice.However, this was privy to an expert\u2019s eyes alone. Dong Tianba was nowhere near that level as he was even standing around scared from the display of speed.\u201cElders, surround my sister!\u201d Dong Tianba shouted at the four elderly. They immediately formed a circle with Dong Xiaowan in their center, their eyes fixed on Lin Tianyu.With a vicious smile, Lin Tianyu said, \u201cIt\u2019s no use. The five of you won\u2019t even see my shadow!\u201dA series of booms were heard and Dong Xiaowan cried out once again. Her second article was removed, even under heavy guard.Dong Tianba couldn\u2019t accept this outcome.They were both in Bone Tempering Stage, yet there was such a gap between them.\u201cAh, what a soothing perfume!\u201dLin Tianyu sniffed hard at the clothing in his hand and was intoxicated by the fragrance, \u201cIf the second clothing is so refreshing, I\u2019m eager to know how miss\u2019 underwear is like!\u201dDong Xiaowan let out a shiver and cried in fear, \u201cBrother!\u201d\u201cI will definitely protect you!\u201d Dong Tianba mustered his courage with a roar and set his eyes on Lin Tianyu\u2019s every move.Although he wished to marry her off to the useless Song Yu, it was because he knew the later wasn\u2019t evil. However, anyone who dared to harm his sister would earn his wrath.\u201cAre you done? Hurry it up!\u201d Seeing Lin Tianyu showing his true colors, Xiao Dandan spat with revulsion. Lin Tianyu nodded while tucking the clothing in his chest and vanished.The next moment, his hand was holding another piece of clothing. And with it, Dong Xiaowan was shamed even further.Plop!Dong Tianba fell to his knees, powerless and helpless. [He is so fast that I can\u2019t even see him.]\u201cWan\u2019er, forgive me, your brother is unable to protect you.\u201d Dong Tianba sobbed.Dong Xiaowan watched him in sorrow and closed her eyes, resigned to her fate.The four elders were also aggrieved. In this game of cat and mouse, they were left without any dignity. It would\u2019ve been better to die than suffer like this.Then, sudden footsteps were heard and a figure overshadowed Dong Tianba.He looked up, only to find Zhuo Fan looking at him.\u201cUh, bro Dong, how about you leave the last try to me?\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201d Xiao Dandan cut Dong Tianba off before he could speak.Scratching his nose, Zhuo Fan pointed at Dong Xiaowan, \u201cHa-ha-ha, I\u2019m her husband!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dSeeing the widespread shock, Zhuo Fan rushed to explain, \u201cUh, no, she is my wife.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?!\u201d The crowd exclaimed.Scratching his head, Zhuo Fan mused a bit and explained, \u201cWell, I did go to her clan to propose but was refused. Does that make me an ex-husband?\u201d[What ex? You were clearly kicked out!] Everyone looked at him in contempt.Xiao Dandan even mocked, \u201cFine then, another Bone Tempering moron won\u2019t change a thing. Plus, seeing your dearly beloved ravaged before your eyes is even more appealing.\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, I don\u2019t mind as long as Dandan doesn\u2019t. One more would hardly matter!\u201d Lin Tianyu boasted.Standing back up, Dong Tianba looked at Zhuo Fan gravely, \u201cBro, you don\u2019t need to involve yourself in this.\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, bro Dong we aren\u2019t strangers, but close pals. Of course, I\u2019ll help you.\u201dThis earned a nod of approval from the people.\u201cI knew you are a good man who knows loyalty.\u201d Dong Tianba was moved to tears.Zhuo Fan then gazed at Dong Xiaowan with a smile of reassurance, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he won\u2019t touch you ever again.\u201dShe thought Zhuo Fan was using this chance to take advantage of her, but his clear eyes evoked unknown feelings in her heart.Zhuo Fan now turned to Lin Tianyu and stuck out his hand, \u201cCome!\u201dLin Tianyu\u2019s smile of mockery froze on his face and was soon replaced by rage. He felt Zhuo Fan was looking down on him\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Once I\u2019m through with her, I\u2019ll deal with you.\u201dLin Tianyu stared down Zhuo Fan with killing intent. As a man from the Seven Noble Houses, everywhere he went all he saw was respect and envy.So a person like Zhuo Fan, who had only contempt, had to be put down. This was an unwritten law of the Tianyu Empire.Dong Tianba sensed his killing intent and sighed at Zhuo Fan\u2019s fate.\u201cHa-ha-ha, bro Dong shouldn\u2019t waste time with a clown.\u201d Aware of the change in the atmosphere, Zhuo Fan still sported a casual smile.It was spoken low enough to seem nonchalant, but loud enough to let everyone in on his words.Everyone knew who he was hinting at, but none saw it coming from a 1st layer of Bone Tempering cultivator.[Only a fool would mock the Seven Noble Houses.]The people started to pity Zhuo Fan\u2019s imminent and gruesome death.\u201cHa-ha-ha, brother Tianyu, a fool just ridiculed you.\u201d Xiao Dandan felt the atmosphere was lacking so she added oil to the fire.Lin Tianyu was now filled with hatred for Zhuo Fan, \u201cHumph, a retard\u2019s words won\u2019t affect me. I\u2019ll just swipe him away once I\u2019m done with the girl.\u201dHe then stepped forward.A fierce wind blew and vanished, but his laughter never stopped banging on the others\u2019 ears, \u201cHa-ha-ha, only the last article remains and then I will get to truly appreciate this lady.\u201dDong Xiaowan was curled up in fear, her hands tightened on her last shred of dignity.Dong Tianba and the four elders made a tight circle around her. However, Zhuo Fan stood there impassive, as if it had nothing to do with him.Suddenly, Lin Tianyu appeared before Dong Xiaowan and reached for her last article with a grin.\u201cHe-he-he, I won!\u201d\u201cThink again!\u201dA snort reached his ears.He didn\u2019t even get the chance to react when a fist smashed into his pretty face.He went tumbling through the air and smacked the pavement before he could get his bearing. When he got up from the ground his cheek was already swollen.\u201cWhat just happened?\u201dThe two were so fast that the onlookers didn\u2019t see a shadow. They only heard two loud sounds and then came Lin Tianyu kissing the ground. Zhuo Fan also appeared, his hand outstretched above Dong Xiaowan.\u201cYou\u2026 got him?\u201d Dong Tianba was stunned. When not even himself and his four elders could save his sister, this kid managed to save the day?Putting aside the fact that his 1st layer Bone Tempering cultivation held more power than a 7th layer, his speed alone was inconceivable.In a casual manner, Zhuo Fan rubbed his presumably sore fist, \u201cSomething just came towards my fist. Owie, it stings.\u201dHis words startled everyone, and Dong Tianba even began to laugh, \u201cHa-ha-ha, great! Bro, how did you do it? I couldn\u2019t even see him!\u201d\u201cDo you even need to see?\u201d Zhuo Fan rose an eyebrow and sported a vague smile, \u201cIsn\u2019t his target obvious? If you build a wall next to her, he\u2019s bound to bump into it.\u201dIt was so obvious now that everyone could think of it.They were so focused on Lin Tianyu\u2019s speed mastery that they were led by the nose. But even with his impressive speed, his target was Dong Xiaowan. All they had to do was keep their eyes on her.This simple reasoning almost made them tear up.\u201cAmazing!\u201d An elder praised Zhuo Fan, \u201cYoung master Song is really a genius worthy of our young master\u2019s admiration.\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, see little sister? Don\u2019t I always say bro Song is a man of ethics and talent? If it wasn\u2019t for him, you\u2019d never have escaped this predicament.\u201d Dong Tianba laughed as he lifted the weight off his heart.Dong Xiaowan blushed as she conveyed her thanks and appreciation to Zhuo Fan through her eyes.Waving it off, Zhuo Fan made eye contact with Dong Tianba, \u201cBro Dong, can you stop, it\u2019s not up to you how it ends.\u201dPicking up on his gesture, Dong Tianba walked before Xiao Dandan with a smile, \u201cMiss, we were lucky to have stopped this youth. I\u2019m sure a disciple from Drifting Flowers Edifice wouldn\u2019t cross her word, so let us end it here. I will be taking my sister now.\u201dWith a deep bow, Dong Tianba was about to leave.\u201cWait!\u201dXiao Dandan eyed the crowd and gave a lopsided grin, \u201cI will forgo this matter, of course, but too bad brother Tianyu isn\u2019t too fond of that idea.\u201d\u201cHumph, in all my life, I\u2019ve never been punched so hard.\u201d Lin Tianyu stared with killing intent, \u201cI am not one to pick on people but this game has yet to entertain me enough. I would have to ask you all to keep me company throughout the end.\u201d[What?]While the others were lamenting inside, Dong Tianba shouted in anger, \u201cAnd when will the game conclude?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be over when I say so.\u201d Lin Tianyu sneered.This came as a terrible shock to the Dong clan. Wasn\u2019t it the same as saying it wouldn\u2019t end until they\u2019d have no dignity left?[You\u2019re too freaking petty to even take a loss!]Zhuo Fan scratched his nose and tightened his fist, [Seems I can return this with courtesy.]He didn\u2019t want to blow this matter out of proportions any further, but this rotten couple didn\u2019t know when to stop!\u201cHa-ha-ha, this barbaric game is fun! Let me join too!\u201d Zhuo Fan laughed.He attracted the eyes of everyone, and also Dong Tianba\u2019s confused look.Zhuo Fan, however, didn\u2019t care about them, \u201cI used to play such a game with bro Dong not too long ago. I ripped his woman\u2019s clothes while he ripped my woman\u2019s. The first to finish got the woman.\u201d\u201cRight, bro Dong?\u201d Zhuo Fan hinted. Dong Tianba quickly woke out of his stupor and nodded.\u201cBut it seems this game isn\u2019t completely fair. You get to tear my woman\u2019s clothes, while I have no target.\u201dLin Tianyu mocked, \u201cYou think you are all-powerful just because you landed a lucky punch? Ha-ha-ha, wishful thinking!\u201dZhuo Fan spoke flatly, \u201cYoung master Lin, are you scared, or perhaps whipped?\u201dChuckles resounded all around, Xiao Dandan\u2019s included. Despite being fearful of the seven houses, everyone cursed them behind their backs.Lin Tianyu was livid but still deferred to Xiao Dandan by looking her way.Frowning, Xiao Dandan spoke plainly to Zhuo Fan, \u201cIt seems besides Zhuo Fan, there are more and more people cropping up who slight the seven houses. But, do you have what it takes? If you can take even one article of clothing from me, I will kick brother Tianyu out and marry you instead!\u201dXiao Dandan\u2019s challenge first came as a shock, then forced laughter spread as everyone came to realize the gap between the two. The seven houses reviled those beneath them. How could they even entertain the thought of accepting a nobody into their house, as a groom no less?With an evil smile, Zhuo Fan blinked, \u201cMiss Dandan, be careful of what you say, lest you\u2019d end up crying.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s going to wail!\u201d Xiao Dandan stuck out her chin.\u201cAlright, enough talk. Get ready, I am about to start!\u201d Lin Tianyu roared over their conversation.Dong Tianba was getting into position but Zhuo Fan waved him off, \u201cHa-ha-ha, since I talked about fairness, only I will be defending Dong Xiaowan, lest he\u2019d use it as an excuse to be even more shameless.\u201d\u201cBro!\u201d Dong Tianba cried, but nodded in the end, \u201cI\u2019ll leave my sister in your care.\u201dHe then took his elders to the side.\u201cMiss Dong, do you trust me?\u201d Zhuo Fan stared at Dong Xiaowan.She jumped, but nodded in the end, realizing the repulsive lecher from before was replaced by a reliable young man.Zhuo Fan grinned, \u201cGreat, enjoy the show!\u201dBut just then, a cackle came into their ears, \u201cHa-ha-ha, the last article is mine!\u201dDong Xiaowan curled up in fear, but Zhuo Fan was as calm as ever. He even had a mocking smile on his face.Bam!A crack resounded and Lin Tianyu didn\u2019t even get to touch Dong Xiaowan as he was sent tumbling in the air before hitting the pavement again. He was filled with shock, \u201cYou could see me?\u201dAs he turned around, Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes were cold.Whoosh!With a crack of thunder, Zhuo Fan appeared behind Xiao Dandan. His hand flashed and her dress was torn apart!\u201cYou call that speed?\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s mockery shocked the crowd.[This kid is an expert!]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94, - What Goes Around, Comes AroundPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay[How could this be?]Xiao Dandan watched the drifting cloth in shock.How could she not know her future husband\u2019s strongest point? Merry Woods was known as the wind house, known for having the fastest speed in the empire.Not to mention, Lin Tianyu chose to abandon power for even more speed. He reached such a mastery that even a peak Bone Tempering expert would be left in the dust.However, a low-level Bone Tempering brat did the unthinkable and managed to surpass him.Not only was Xiao Dandan incredulous, but so was Lin Tianyu. His face was frozen in shock as no words could leave his mouth.As for Dong Tianba\u2019s group, they were slackjawed. Particularly young master Dong, who knew Song Yu for ages. Never once had he displayed such outstanding features. Yet, here he was, a third-rate clan\u2019s member winning against a seven houses\u2019 disciple.Everyone became silent, with all eyes focused on the proud Zhuo Fan, their words stuck in their throat.Grinning evilly, Zhuo Fan sniffed and said with satisfaction oozing from his voice, \u201cMiss Dandan, you truly are an amazing beauty, evident from this fragrance. I will never forget this soothing smell for as long as I live.\u201dXiao Dandan stared at him with a red face. Lin Tianyu was turning green, his heart bleeding from hatred.[Bastard! You dare harass my wife in my presence? Do you take Merry Woods for nothing?]Taking a side glance at Lin Tianyu, Zhuo Fan grinned inside and flashed before Xiao Dandan. She then cried in panic when Zhuo Fan hugged her.She tried to resist but was a moot effort against Zhuo Fan\u2019s cultivation.\u201cDamn brat, what do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Lin Tianyu roared.Zhuo Fan watched the red-faced Xiao Dandan and raised an eyebrow in challenge, \u201cMiss Dandan, I\u2019m not as flimsy as that weak lord. I\u2019ve always learned to take the initiative with a woman. My actions were a bit rude to you, miss. So, you can hit me or curse me, but I\u2019ll still do the same.\u201dXiao Dandan was glaring at him, yet her heart stirred. Zhuo Fan\u2019s pushy attitude was worlds apart from Lin Tianyu\u2019s flattery.This feeling was so new to her that she didn\u2019t know where to place it.\u201cRotten brat, let go or you\u2019ll be sorry!\u201dZhuo Fan was courting his woman before his eyes and even before the public. Something that Lin Tianyu could not bear any longer.But Zhuo Fan was far from done. He pulled her closer instead, eliciting a charming cry from Xiao Dandan.It made any male on the scene feel their pulse quickened, swallowing dryly, and sporting wide and nasty grins. Meanwhile, the women around blushed.Lin Tianyu\u2019s face was ashen, wishing to tear Zhuo Fan limb by limb.Snorting, Zhuo Fan raised a taunting eyebrow, \u201cBrother Lin, isn\u2019t this a game of your own accords? Since time immemorial, the winner receives everything while the loser ends up with nothing. If brother Lin wins, you\u2019ll have two women. If not, well\u2026\u201dZhuo Fan patronized, then turned to blow his hot breath in Xiao Dandan\u2019s ear, \u201cMiss Dandan, if I win, please be so kind as to kick this man out and make me your guest.\u201dHis tone was soft, yet his words traveled far, particularly stabbing into Lin Tianyu\u2019s ears.However, this wasn\u2019t what struck his core, it was Xiao Dandan\u2019s blushing and faint nod.Zhuo Fan had given another wave of shock to the crowd and many were now eyeing him with envy.[Damn rotten bastard! He snatched a Drifting Flowers Edifice\u2019s girl right out of that flimsy Merry Woods\u2019 disciple in minutes! His skill is worthy of being a pioneer in the sacred art of chasing skirts. If I had such skill, I would also take a Drifting Flowers Edifice girl for myself!]Lin Tianyu trembled, his lips leaked a trail of blood.\u201cBastard, you\u2019ve taken this too far!\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, what of it? What goes around comes around. Next time, if you\u2019re lucky enough to win, then speak.\u201d Zhuo Fan\u2019s wicked grin wasn\u2019t in the least bit heroic or worthy of his conquest, but it made everyone\u2019s heart shiver. While the women were swooning.Lin Tianyu had a belly full of hatred. Zhuo Fan\u2019s incessant mockery was trumped by stealing his woman. This exceeded his bottom line long ago, \u201cSon of a bitch! Once I peel your girl\u2019s clothes, I\u2019ll finish you off.\u201dLin Tianyu appeared before Dong Xiaowan.She cried in fear but Lin Tianyu\u2019s evil clutches didn\u2019t arrive. A slap cuffed him over the ear into the ground. When he looked up, Zhuo Fan was back next to Xiao Dandan, continuing to mock, \u201cMiss Dandan, that limp noodle lost again, I\u2019m afraid I will have to relieve you of another article.\u201dA rip was heard and an article left Xiao Dandan\u2019s body more exposed.Zhuo Fan lifted her chin, \u201cMiss Dandan, please, don\u2019t blame my uncouth act.\u201dHer charming eyes rolled and her face turned rosy, playing coy, \u201cCan\u2019t you be more gentle?\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, I am uncouth and unmannered, this is something that won\u2019t change for as long as I live.\u201d Zhuo Fan shook his head. Lin Tianyu\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and looked as though we was about to spit fire, \u201cRotted bastards, both of you!\u201dLin Tianyu went for Dong Xiaowan again with the same result. Zhuo Fan made sure to even slap him five times for good measure.And it resulted in Xiao Dandan\u2019s turn to loosen her clothing. Yet the lady hardly cared, making Lin Tianyu\u2019s coals of anger burn hotter.With but one flimsy and thin piece left on miss Xiao Dandan, Zhuo Fan\u2019s grin turned maniacal, \u201cBrother Lin, final chance! If you fail now, miss Dandan is mine.\u201d\u201cWretched filth, you dare mock the seven houses?\u201d Lin Tianyu spat, the ire in his heart having grown out of his control. Yet oddly enough, he was clear headed enough to understand Zhuo Fan\u2019s speed overwhelmed him, so he chose another angle, using Merry Woods\u2019 name.But why would Zhuo Fan care when he even had the nerve to kill Hell Valley\u2019s elders?As a result, Lin Tianyu words only worked to goad Zhuo Fan further, who, under Lin Tianyu\u2019s rage-filled eyes, landed a kiss on Xiao Dandan\u2019s check, \u201cHa-ha-ha, I\u2019m about to be Drifting Flowers Edifice\u2019s son-in-law, why the hell would I be afraid of your goddamned Merry Woods? Isn\u2019t that right, my lady?\u201dXiao Dandan was so far gone, accepting anything he was throwing at her, that she nodded without remorse.\u201cAh!\u201dIt would seem Lin Tianyu had had enough and charged at the couple. He even went as far as cursing at his revered Xiao Dandan, \u201cBitch, you are both a bunch of dogs. I will send you both to hell!\u201dHe made a hand sign and a green gale gathered around his legs. The sharp whistling spoke of its deadly power as he kicked at them.He had forgone using his prized speed in favor of stealing victory by force.\u201cMid spirit ranked martial art, Razor Kick!\u201dXiao Dandan cried in shock, \u201cLin Tianyu, the gall of you, to try to kill me right in Drifting Flowers Edifice\u2019s city!\u201d\u201cHumph, for a skank like you, I will do the world a favor by killing you both!\u201dXiao Dandan was now afraid after noticing the killing intent in his eyes. She was only in Qi Condensation Stage, while Zhuo Fan was in his 1st layer of Bone Tempering Stage. It was not possible for him to take on such an attack.However, Zhuo Fan just mocked, \u201cBrother Lin, is this your final struggle? Oh, how pathetic!\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s arm snaked around Xiao Dandan\u2019s waist while his other acted as a shield.Bam!The green gale lashed at Zhuo Fan\u2019s arm, but the sounds coming out of it was that of screeching metal.The kick didn\u2019t even scratch his arm, though his sleeve did turn to shreds, revealing an all glorious and perfectly chiseled arm.\u201cThis can\u2019t be!\u201dLin Tianyu seemingly crazy as he muttered, \u201cYou\u2019re a body cultivator? How can you be so fast?\u201dWith a mocking smile, Zhuo Fan simply replied, \u201cWho told you that we can\u2019t also train in speed? Trading off power for such measly speed will only be done by a dumbass like you.\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s eyes evoked killing intent that turned Lin Tianyu into a shivering mess.He didn\u2019t get to react as Zhuo Fan kicked him on the head.Blood spurted and Lin Tianyu felt a sharp pain digging its way into him. He let out one final wail before his eyes lost their light and slumped on the ground.None of the people could believe their eyes. A simple kick finished a Seven Noble Houses\u2019 disciple, who had a 6 layer advantage over his opponent.The fight ended not in praise of power or speed but rather mockery towards Merry Woods.\u201cMiss Dandan, did you see that? I don\u2019t discriminate, I am as uncouth and rude to men as well. If your fianc\u00e9e lives, he still won\u2019t see reason. I hope you do not blame me for this.\u201dZhuo Fan acted like his crime never happened and resumed flirting with the lady.Xiao Dandan watched him enamored and blinked in joy, \u201cYou\u2019ve done perfectly! With you around, why would I need that trash for? Don\u2019t you worry, you\u2019ll soon join Drifting Flowers Edifice and Merry Woods won\u2019t be able to lay a finger on you.\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, thank you miss Dandan for your care, just that\u2026\u201d Zhuo Fan eyed Xiao Dandan\u2019s last vestige of dignity, \u201cAccording to the rules, for your fianc\u00e9e to lose, I\u2019d have to pry out the last article!\u201dWith a coy and blushing face, Xiao Dandan wrapped her soft lily-white hands around his neck, \u201cBrother, I am soon to be yours. If you want my body, you\u2019ll have to wait till tonight. Or do you want the people to see everything?\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha\u2026\u201dZhuo Fan scratched his nose after looking at her delectable body. Then, Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes turned sharp and startled the flirting woman.\u201cHumph, weren\u2019t you listening? What goes around comes around. This goes for you too.\u201dZhuo Fan reached for her last piece and Xiao Dandan was filled with fear.Would she have any face left to walk into Drifting Flowers Edifice if she went naked in the middle of the city?Suddenly, a loud shout came, \u201cStop!\u201dAnd two blue silk ribbons drifted over.Zhuo Fan\u2019s hand froze in shock, \u201ca Profound Heaven expert!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95 - Bewitching WhispersPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator: StarReaderEditor: p4553rTwo blue silk ribbons shot towards Zhuo Fan. He thought of dodging, but he dismissed that idea.Despite not unfolding his wings, his speed was beyond the Bone Tempering Stage, thus allowing him to one-up Lin Tianyu.This was a shock to everyone, but not unlikely to happen.In the case where his speed was to match a Profound Heaven expert\u2019s, that would label him a monster. Across the vast world, he might be the sole person with such a deviant degree of body refining.It was tantamount to telling everyone who he was.[I\u2019ll have to gamble!]One ribbon tightened around him and made any movement impossible. There, he reminded himself.[I just need to showcase how strong I am but within limits. Unlike that known deviant, Zhuo Fan, who could kill a Profound Heaven expert.]The other wrapped Xiao Dandan in a protective embrace.What followed next was the arrival of the owner of the ribbons. The people lowered their heads in respect, as did Dong Tianba and his sister.Zhuo Fan only gave her a rough glance. She was a lady in her thirties, wearing a thin veil over half her face, yet incapable of hiding her grace.And with how high her cultivation was, it garnered even more respect.While she walked with light steps, her eyes were solely focused on Xiao Dandan. She extended a dainty finger and tapped Xiao Dandan\u2019s forehead.Yuan Qi entered Xiao Dandan\u2019s body and made her shiver, while also taking away the redness in her cheeks.\u201cWhat, where am I?\u201d Xiao Dandan looked around in confusion, but when she saw Zhuo Fan it all came back in a flurry of images. She cried in shock and her face went beet red.\u201cH-how could I have done that?\u201d\u201cSilly child, you can\u2019t even tell when you were tricked?\u201d The woman in blue shook her head, then her eyes snapped to Zhuo Fan.\u201cLittle brother, if you are intent on chasing after Drifting Flowers Edifice\u2019s girl, you can chase them using your skills. But don\u2019t you think using Bewitching Whispers is demeaning and vile?\u201dZhuo Fan praised her in his heart, [She\u2019s quite perceptive].Bewitching Whispers affected a person\u2019s mind so that the user could lead his victims to do whatever he wanted. This was how Zhuo Fan got hold of Xiao Dandan so easily.This little trick wasn\u2019t a demonic cultivator\u2019s secret skill, but not anyone could employ it. First of all, the user\u2019s soul had to be strong, which made most of the demonic cultivators beneath Profound Heaven Stage unable to use it.And because this skill had limited power, most demonic cultivators did not train to use it. Ergo, the number of people aware of Bewitching Whispers were few and far in between.Yet, here was one woman who knew its effect.Zhuo Fan grinned, \u201cLady, I have no intention of chasing miss Dandan. This is only for the sake of teaching her a lesson.\u201d\u201cSenior aunt, don\u2019t listen to this runt. He dared to humiliate me and looks down on Drifting Flowers Edifice.\u201d Xiao Dandan was raging as she recalled the scandal she partook in. Even tears started swelling in her eyes.However, the blue woman eyed her coldly and shouted, \u201cQuiet, haven\u2019t you had enough of disgracing yourself?\u201dThen turned to Zhuo Fan, \u201cI would\u2019ve long ago put you in your place if not for knowing you had a good reason for using that foul skill to charm a woman in Drifting Flowers City.\u201dThe woman then turned her attention to Dong Xiaowan and spoke in apology, \u201cMiss, Dandan was spoiled by her master. I will make sure to punish her. Please don\u2019t take it to heart.\u201d\u201cAh, I would never\u2026\u201d Dong Xiaowan was startled.The lady in blue smiled as she flew, and two ribbons took Xiao Dandan and the unconscious Lin Tianyu. But Xiao Dandan didn\u2019t forget to glare at Zhuo Fan with loathing.Zhuo Fan, though, did not care, he was thinking of the blue lady\u2019s last brief look she gave him.Thanks to Zhuo Fan\u2019s strong soul, he managed to sense it.[Was I just found out?] Zhuo Fan frowned as he watched her leave.\u201cBrother!\u201dDong Tianba came with the rest to Zhuo Fan to express his gratitude, \u201cThank you so much. If it weren\u2019t for you, the Dong clan\u2019s name would\u2019ve been sullied. Dammit, none of the seven houses\u2019 domain is safe to linger for long.\u201d\u201cBig brother Song, thank you\u2026\u201d Dong Xiaowan tightened the thin clothing on her body and spoke shyly.Not paying attention to any of this, Zhuo Fan spoke with a frown, \u201cBro Dong, who was she?\u201dDong Tianba\u2019s tone was grave, \u201cDrifting Flowers Edifice\u2019s 1st Overseer, the Iris Edifice\u2019s Qin Caiqing! Haaa\u2026 such luck that the one we met was the Iris Overseer. She is honorable and kind. She is known to never pick on clans and other disciples. But if it were Peony Overseer, with her fickle personality, she would\u2019ve released her wrath on us!\u201d\u201cI see, with her cultivation, it is no wonder she is an Overseer.\u201dZhuo Fan took a deep breath and ripped the ribbon to shreds.\u201cBro, how are you so strong? That was Iris Overseer\u2019s ribbon imbued with her Yuan Qi. How did you break out of it?\u201dDong Tianba watched Zhuo Fan as though he was viewing a monster, \u201cI feel like I don\u2019t know you anymore.\u201dLaughing, Zhuo Fan waved it off and took out a small bottle, \u201cThe Song clan is third-rate, but we have our ways. Look, this is our Body Tempering Pill. It\u2019s all thanks to this that my body is so strong.\u201d\u201cAs if! Body Tempering Pill is only a 4th-grade pill. It\u2019s not outstanding enough to make you stronger than a 7th layer Bone Tempering cultivator and break out of a Profound Heaven expert\u2019s restriction!\u201d Dong Tianba\u2019s expression remained impassive.Zhuo Fan smiled, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a secret method of the Song clan if anyone could refine it. You think I\u2019d join the Hundred Pill Meeting if it weren\u2019t for this?\u201dDong Tianba was starting to believe him after hearing Zhuo Fan continue to praise the pill.But what they didn\u2019t know was that these were only lies made up by Zhuo Fan.Meanwhile, Zhuo Fan was feeling vexed. He could not understand why Qin Caiqing did not expose him if she knew who he was? Did she go to call for help thinking she could not defeat him?[If that is the case, then staying here would be all the more dangerous. She could be asking for backup.]Zhuo Fan said frantically, \u201cUh, bro Dong, I have some urgent matters to take care of. Let\u2019s talk at a later date.\u201d\u201cSigh, I haven\u2019t given my proper thanks, how can\u2026\u201d But before he could finish, Zhuo Fan was already meters away waving his hand as he left.Dong Tianba was startled but sighed in the end, \u201cBro Song truly is husband material. Wan\u2019er, you must be regretting your refusal by now.\u201d\u201cBrother\u2026\u201dDong Xiaowan rolled her eyes, but still peeked at Zhuo Fan with clear and emotion-filled eyes\u2026Meanwhile, at the Drifting Flowers Edifice, in the guest hall.A charming and enticing woman in red sat in the lounge. She wore a thin veil, obscuring her most prominent features.But it couldn\u2019t hide the fire in her eyes that could stir the coldest heart.She was a true vixen!On her left was a middle-aged man, with even whiter hands than hers. He was stroking his goatee, but his eyes rested on her every curve.The woman in red rolled her eyes and smiled, \u201cElder Lin, do I have something on me?\u201d\u201cCough, Peony Overseer must be joking.\u201dThe old man faked his cough and showed an embarrassed smile, \u201cI can\u2019t help but wonder, why isn\u2019t the exalted Edifice Lord present and it is the Peony Overseer who is welcoming me instead.\u201d\u201cHee-hee-hee, is Elder Lin not satisfied with me?\u201d The lady fluttered her eyes at him.Her gesture almost stole the elder\u2019s soul away, finding it difficult to reply, \u201cUh, Peony Overseer is very considerate and kind, and, ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201d\u201cHumph, I came here to join the Hundred Pill Meeting, not to see you two flirt.\u201dAn angry snort came from Peony Overseer\u2019s right, a red-haired elderly, \u201cSince the meeting hasn\u2019t started, I\u2019ll be leaving. I have important things to take care of.\u201d\u201cHell Valley\u2019s fifth elder, why are you so vexed?\u201d Peony Overseer smiled, \u201cThe meeting will commence upon the Edifice Lord\u2019s order. The great houses have yet to gather, so it is only natural for it to take a while longer.\u201d\u201cPeony Overseer, don\u2019t listen to this old goat grumble. These days, Hell Valley was sacked of its three elders by a mere brat. They lost all credibility, so how could they have the patience to participate in the Hundred Pill Meeting? Right now, fifth elder must be thinking of new and ingenious ways to skin that punk alive. Or maybe the anxiety of having his poor little elderly life in danger got him wound so tight he has been jumping in his sleep! It must be torture, ha-ha-ha!\u201d\u201cLin Zitian, screw off! I wonder how many elders Merry Woods would lose if they met that brat!\u201d Fifth elder slapped the table and glared at the middle-aged man.Lin Zitian also stood up and returned a glare without fear, \u201cWanna fight?\u201dTheir power was on full display and sparks could fly at any second!But laughter interrupted their staring contest, \u201cHa-ha-ha, how rowdy! If you guys want to fight it off, count me in!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Yet, his tone lacked the respect and manner one should have when talking to the three other people present there.The trio\u2019s faces turned ashen, their anger was slowly rising, but they held their tongue.This scene would shock anyone. Three Profound Heaven experts were mocked by a Bone Tempering pup. And they didn\u2019t even retort, despite the rude tone.Fifth elder, who was known for his quick temper, was also silent. A scene that even his disciples would find it hard to imagine.\u201cElder Yan, you should mind your disciple, he doesn\u2019t seem to have any manners. Is this how a junior speaks to his elders?\u201d fifth elder said unhappily.Yet, the elder in green caressed his beard with a smile, \u201cHell Valley\u2019s fifth elder, why argue with a child? It doesn\u2019t befit your status, ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201d\u201cExactly, you\u2019re totally not acting as a senior should. So, why should I treat you like one?\u201d The youth\u2019s brash voice was tinted with mockery.Fifth elder shivered and his face turned red, itching to pry this fool\u2019s head from his body. But he forced his anger down and resumed to clenching his fists.With a crack, a piece of the table was vaporized.Lin Zitian eyed the fifth elder\u2019s anger and secretly sighed. He had some reservations when looking at the elder in green as he forced a laughter, \u201cHa-ha-ha, I\u2019d never guessed such a small meeting will bring together four of the seven houses. With Elder Yan attending, the meeting will run smoothly!\u201d\u201cHe-he-he, Lin Zitian, you don\u2019t need to give me lip service. I know none of you see me eye to eye. But who told you to name it as the Hundred Pill Meeting? You think it\u2019s worthy of the name \u2018Hundred Pill\u2019 if I, Vicious Pill King, is missing in attendance?\u201dThe elder in green didn\u2019t give Lin Zitian any respect and even mocked him to the point Lin Zitian turned his head away.Peony Overseer was livid, but on top of her anger lied a deep seething hatred.\u201cElder Yan Song,\u201d Peony Overseer spat, \u201cDrifting Flowers Edifice doesn\u2019t seem to have extended Pill King Hall an invitation. So why have you graced us with your uninvited presence?\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, Peony Overseer, you\u2019re as fiery as ever!\u201dWith his eyes flashing green, Yan Song snorted, \u201cIn the Tianyu Empire, I can go wherever I want with no one daring to oppose me! Now that I\u2019m here in your Drifting Flowers City, are you going to kick me out?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dShe was poised to attack, but Lin Zitian stopped her, \u201cPeony Overseer, calm yourself.\u201dEying Yan Song cautiously, Lin Zitian sighed as he gave her a look, \u201cBefore Edifice Lord comes, be careful of devolving the situation!\u201dPeony Overseer snorted, turning her body away, easing Lin Zitian\u2019s worry.\u201cHa-ha-ha, Peony Overseer is like a lass, so spiteful. So, it is a wonder to me how you still became an overseer? Master, you were right. A bunch of broads can never accomplish anything. Drifting Flowers Edifice is the worst of the seven houses by far.\u201d The youth ridiculed.The eyes of the three turned sharply. [Vicious Pill King is too arrogant and his disciple belittles anyone he sees.]Their \u2018friendly\u2019 conversation was interrupted when a sound came from outside the door.\u201cLittle brother, Drifting Flowers Edifice may have only women but it has stood strong in Tianyu Empire for a millennia. It has its own principles, it is not something anyone can criticize.\u201dA beauty in blue floated in, the Iris Overseer, Qin Caiqing!\u201cSenior sister, you\u2019re back!\u201d Peony Overseer cried, regaining her confidence, \u201cWhere did you go? We have someone barging uninvited and I am powerless to stop them.\u201dPeony Overseer\u2019s eyes snapped to Yan Song but Qin Caiqing simply smiled, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be taking care of your precious disciple instead? I once told you to raise your disciple better, not to disgrace Drifting Flowers Edifice\u2019s reputation.\u201d\u201cWho did she offend?\u201dShaking her head, Qin Caiqing simply clapped.Two female disciples brought Xiao Dandan who was still wrapped in the blue ribbon. With her curves full-on display, she earned the youth\u2019s fiery gaze.Then two more disciples brought an unconscious Lin Tianyu.\u201cTianyu!\u201dLin Zitian jumped next to him, then his look was filled with murderous desire, \u201cWho hurt him?\u201dThe youth cut her off before she could reply, \u201cMaster, is that kid\u2019s injury grave?\u201d\u201cHe-he-he, that\u2019s putting it mildly. If not dead then a cripple. The culprit sure had no restraint.\u201d Yan Song enjoyed others\u2019 misfortune.The youth laughed in ridicule, \u201cMerry Woods\u2019 disciple can\u2019t even take a hit. And his master is no different either.\u201dLin Zitian gnashed his teeth, glaring at the youth.Qin Caiqing smiled, \u201cLittle brother is wrong. The one he met was an even younger man, whose strength is above all the seven houses\u2019 genius disciples. Little brother is Elder Yan\u2019s disciple, but even you will meet the same fate.\u201dThe youth frowned, filled with rebuke. Qin Caiqing secretly smiled.\u201cSenior sister, why didn\u2019t you bring him? Is he stronger than you?\u201d Peony Overseer jerked.Shaking her head, Qin Caiqing said, \u201cPerhaps not, but you know how I am, staying outside others\u2019 affairs. If someone messed with my disciple, I\u2019ll intervene, but\u2026\u201dQin Caiqing sighed as she looked at Xiao Dandan, \u201cDandan, you explain. And be honest. I already know everything that transpired.\u201d\u201cYes, senior aunt!\u201dXiao Dandan sobbed a nod, then retold the events.The people there sighed at the conclusion. Not for the humiliated Dong clan though, since none of the seven houses gave a damn about these people. They were considered slaves in their eyes.And their disciples were of the same mind. Some might be even more ruthless than Xiao Dandan. It was only thanks to the Drifting Flowers Edifice\u2019s restrictions on their disciples that made them far more restrained.What was on everyone\u2019s mind was Zhuo Fan\u2019s conduct.Not only did he end the humiliation the Dong clan received but turned the humiliation back at Xiao Dandan and her fianc\u00e9e. With such a savage method.Fifth elder couldn\u2019t help associating him with a familiar figure.Didn\u2019t his actions resemble that of Zhuo Fan who killed the seventh elder?He stroked his beard as he stated, \u201cHa-ha-ha, what is wrong with the Tianyu Empire? With Zhuo Fan as the origin, many more are starting to belittle the seven houses, assaulting our disciples again and again. If we don\u2019t keep them in check, none will fear us.\u201d\u201cHe-he-he, isn\u2019t it all because of Hell Valley\u2019s incompetence? You have yet to find that insolent brat too. You\u2019re making us, the other six houses, look bad!\u201d Yan Song mocked.Fifth elder wasn\u2019t angry as he turned to the youth behind him with a smile, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s all our fault. But for an elder to step into a disciple\u2019s conflict, isn\u2019t it more shameful? Lin Zitian, too bad you didn\u2019t bring another disciple to take revenge for Tianyu and save that Dandan girl\u2019s reputation.\u201dThe youth jumped in front of Xiao Dandan before Lin Zitian could reply, and took her arm, \u201cCome with me, I will avenge you!\u201dAnd with that short declaration, the two were gone, causing the fifth elder to show a broad smile.\u201cInsolent! That brat has no manners at all. He even ignored my presence and took my disciple away!\u201d Peony Overseer\u2019s lip trembled in rage.Yan Song waved his hand as he walked off, \u201cHa-ha-ha, in this world, a woman\u2019s fate is to land in a man\u2019s arms. Drifting Flowers Edifice wouldn\u2019t have lasted so long without this!\u201dWhen Yan Song was gone, the fifth elder\u2019s eyes squinted as he too took the initiative to leave. \u201cThat old fool must have also sensed it\u2026\u201dPeony Overseer was confused, \u201cWhy is everyone leaving?\u201dLin Zitian frowned, eying Qin Caiqing with a profound gaze, \u201cIris Overseer, are you certain that troublemaker isn\u2019t that demon Zhuo Fan?\u201d\u201cWhat? He\u2019s Zhuo Fan?\u201d Peony Overseer jerked.Qin Caiqing\u2019s eyes showed a peculiar light, \u201cI am unclear. The kid is outstanding, but not enough to kill Profound Heaven experts!\u201d\u201cMaybe he is faking it\u2026\u201d Lin Zitian then laughed, \u201cI see now why even Vicious Pill King is impatient to watch the fight. If he really is Zhuo Fan, his disciple is as good as dead! At that time\u2026\u201cYan Song will make a move. However\u2026\u201d His lips traced a cryptic curve. Qin Caiqing finished, \u201cIt is unclear if Zhuo Fan can kill a man viler than even You Guiqi. After all, he is called the Vicious Pill King for a reason!\u201dLin Zitian nodded with a mutter, \u201cI just hope he is Zhuo Fan\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 - Scourge WomanPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayUnder the faint rays of dusk, Zhuo Fan was venturing alone through the city. He seemed to be at ease, but his mind was hard at work. He was spreading his soul to his surroundings for detection purposes.Yet, after such a long time, no expert appeared in sight.\u201cMaybe I\u2019m reading too much into this. Maybe my cover isn\u2019t blown.\u201dZhuo Fan whispered. As he strolled around, he ended up around a street with run-down buildings.This place housed people like Zhuo Fan, those from third-rate clans.\u201cHey, this is my area, take your things out of here!\u201d\u201cCut the crap, I came first. What\u2019s yours? Get lost!\u201d\u201cKid, you dare talk back to this young master? Do you know who I am?\u201d\u201cHumph, why would anyone care? If you think you\u2019re so great then how did you end up here?\u201dThese events played out everywhere, the third rate clans claiming a new dwelling as theirs. This was a place where the weak were despised. Yet, ironically, even these weaklings, who were discarded in this dump, fought among each other.\u201cHumph, what a pathetic bunch. This is why third rate clans can\u2019t amount to anything and deserves to be in the slums.\u201dZhuo Fan spoke in a harsh voice, no longer paying them any heed.He walked further in and found the shabby buildings on both sides have already been taken.Everyone eyed him with open hostility, afraid he\u2019d want to fight them over their lodgings.[This seemed like a common occurrence here.] Zhuo Fan scoffed, his every action was only to further his own goals. Fighting over a house disgraceful to him.Unfortunately, he found no place vacant as he wandered around. [Do I need to fight for a bed? It is much better to take the sky as my roof.]Zhuo Fan suddenly halted. His eyes watched the house before him with skepticism, then he looked at the people around oddly.At the end of this row of shabby houses, there was one building that looked to be in better shape, yet no one lived in it.With how rowdy the crowd was before, now, there was no sign of anyone around.Frowning, he turned to the people fighting in doubt, \u201cWhy are you foolishly fighting? Can\u2019t you see that empty house?\u201d\u201cHumph, you\u2019re the fool! If you want to die, go right ahead!\u201d Someone was quick to snap in derision.Zhuo Fan was baffled. But one man was kind enough to advise, \u201cBrother, you can stay at my house if you\u2019d like. I will make room for you, but you mustn\u2019t step foot in that one.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dSighing, the man explained, \u201cYou are new here so you don\u2019t know. The owner is a scourge woman, her body riddled with disease. Many have disregarded this warning and chose to live there. Even though they stayed far away from her, in the back of the house, they all died three days later.\u201d\u201cYeah, not even beggars would stay there. And because of lack of space in the Drifting Flowers City as the Hundred Pill Meeting approaches, we were sent to this dump! Goddamit, isn\u2019t Drifting Flowers Edifice the ruler here? Why don\u2019t they just take out this scourged woman once and for all?\u201dZhuo Fan snorted inside.If that woman was disease ridden, he had to see it first hand for himself. [You all are standing outside yapping on and on. None of you dare to take action and still want to send someone else in to kill her.]It was obvious who were the true scourges.Ignoring the senseless chatter, Zhuo Fan was walking straight to it under everyone\u2019s gaze.\u201cBrother, do you have a death wish?\u201d\u201cMy life is boundless!\u201d Zhuo Fan waved him off.Whether plagued or poisoned, while other people heed it in anxiety, he was worriless. Demon Transformation Art could absorb anything in this world, even this disease!The closer he got to this plagued district, the colder it became. This made Zhuo Fan frown.He found no plague here, but abnormal changes that could only come about from an array.\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201dZhuo Fan followed the shout to see a girl before a broken-down house in rough linen staring at him.The girl may be dressed in coarse linen, hiding her form and face, but her pure eyes caught Zhuo Fan off guard.He swore he never saw such mesmerizing eyes in his life.\u201cWhat beautiful eyes!\u201d Zhuo Fan admired.The girl\u2019s cheeks turned a tint rosier. Her eyes lowered a bit but still had the same coldness, \u201cWho are you? Who told you you can come in?\u201d\u201cUhm, I am Nightrain City\u2019s Song Yu, arriving here for the Hundred Pill Meeting. Because of my third rate clan\u2019s status, I can only stay here!\u201d Zhuo Fan cupped his hands, smiling like a gentleman.The girl frowned, her tone harsh, \u201cThen stay in another house, aren\u2019t you afraid of death by coming here?\u201d\u201cI believe death is unimportant. I saw how selfish and despicable the people here are acting and couldn\u2019t recognize such men as my neighbors. I would rather choose death in this peaceful place!\u201d\u201cStop lying, think I\u2019d believe you\u2019re sophistry?\u201d She huffed.Helpless, Zhuo Fan made a heartbroken face, \u201cLady, I\u2019ll be honest. All the people before are stronger than me and I can\u2019t beat them. If you throw me out, I will die at their hands!\u201dTo such a sound argument, the lady nodded, believing it somewhat. But Zhuo Fan switched tones way too fast, which caught her off guard and caused her to be suspicious. Her tone grew colder as she asked, \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of being beaten to death, but not afraid of me? Do you know who I am?\u201d\u201cI do, of course I do!\u201dZhuo Fan bobbed his head, \u201cI heard them say there is a scourge woman here, that must mean you. But I would rather get diseased than die beaten. As they say, a flower should be allowed to roam free\u2026 \u201c\u201cQuiet, don\u2019t try to play smart with me!\u201dThe lady snapped, her eyes darting around in thought. She pointed her white finger to a broken house, \u201cSleep there, but you are to never wander outside at night, or you will die.\u201d\u201cYes, lady, I promise!\u201d Zhuo Fan nodded and when he looked up, she was gone.He narrowed his eyes and his revering gaze now turned to one of coldness.[I couldn\u2019t see through her cultivation. Did she reach the Radiant Stage? Or maybe she\u2019s a common person? But how can a common person hold such a tone before a Bone Tempering expert?][Humph, how amusing!]Zhuo Fan\u2019s mouth perked up into a grin and entered his house, [You must be up to something since you forbid me from going out at night. Then I will do just that and find out what you\u2019re hiding!]Zhuo Fan went to meditate.Time trickled by and the night cast a cloak of darkness over the slums.A sudden ripple came from the slums, followed by a sharp decrease in temperature. Zhuo Fan shivered and muttered, \u201cI was right, it is an array.\u201dHis hand flashed and revealed a small bottle. It contained the same pill he used in Allbeast Mountain Range, an Energy Concealing Pill!Whoosh!Zhuo Fan flicked it into the air and a flash of red came from his body and swallowed it.The ethereal Blood Infant made Zhuo Fan give off a wicked smile. Not even a Radiant Stage could find it now that it ate that pill.\u201cGo!\u201dBlood Infant went through the walls and flew deeper into the slums, reaching the furthest area.That place was in ruins, ruins that formed an odd array. The lady sat upright in its center, deep in meditation. The bright moonlight, with its extreme coldness, entered inside the array then her body, while the rest chilled the slums.With each ray of power from the moonlight she absorbed, her body grew a sheen layer of ice. Then, a green flash from her forehead pierced through the ice and slowly faded away.Each time that happened, the lady\u2019s eyelids trembled, as if in great pain!\u201c3rd-grade array, A Moon Array!\u201dZhuo Fan sighed and withdrew the Blood Infant.He now understood why the previous people died. He thought it was because of the scourge woman\u2019s vile conduct or her disease. But after he saw it, he knew that it was neither of those. She was only treating herself.The ignorant people approached her and the moonlight\u2019s yin energy ravaged through their meridians and that damage eventually killed them.Moon Array allowed one to absorb the moon\u2019s yin and cultivate, but spending too much time in it would throw one\u2019s inner balance out of whack. Yet, this scourge woman had no intention of cultivating, she was just using the moon\u2019s yin to suppress the poison inside her.Unfortunately, this was not without side effects. As yin gathered inside, her meridians would start to deteriorate and one day, she would become a cripple. The more she tried to contain the poison, the more violent it would be when she couldn\u2019t hold it in check any longer.It could even take her life.Such a scene caused even the great demon cultivator, Zhuo Fan to feel pity for the lady. Just what poison was so deadly that needed such an extreme method to suppress it?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 - Playing the FoolPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAt the first ray of dawn, the moon hid back behind the forest while the sun was rising to take its rightful place in the sky. In its shine, the ice on the scourge woman thawed.The lady opened her eyes and sighed with exhaustion.\u201cLady!\u201d A cry of shock came from Zhuo Fan, holding fruits to his bosom as he staggered towards her.The scourge woman jumped to her feet and waved the leaves to cover the array.Then she snapped a glare towards Zhuo Fan, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you not to wander about? What are you doing here?\u201d\u201cUh, lady! You didn\u2019t say anything about going out during the day!\u201d Zhuo Fan acted oblivious to the array beneath him, pointing naively at the sky.The scourge woman was stunned, then blushed. She rebuked, \u201cIf you are to stay in this place, you must remain in your quarters, even through the day. Or I\u2019ll kick you out!\u201d\u201cEh?!\u201dZhuo Fan shuddered from the heavy injustice that befell him. He hanged his head and walked away with remose. But then he turned to leave the fruits before the woman.\u201cLady, I find your complexion to be slightly pale so I picked these this morning, please take them. And thank you for letting me stay.\u201d Zhuo Fan sighed and trod away.He made himself out to seem as though he was a particularly bleak figure, filled with loneliness who had suffered a dash of injustice.The woman turned from him to the fruits and her heart softened, picking one up.Zhuo Fan\u2019s back was towards her but his soul gave him full knowledge of her every move. He let out a devious grin.So long she picked just one fruit, it proved he had made a breakthrough to her heart. Next, he needed to stick to her for as long as possible to find out the poison that had cursed her.There\u2019s a fine line between godly medicine and abominable poison. As the Hundred Pill Meeting hadn\u2019t begun yet, he had no clue where to search for rare ingredients. Since he had the time, who knew if he might get something from sticking close to this scourge woman?[He-he-he, women are the best swindler and, ironically enough, the easiest targets!] Zhuo Fan snickered inside as he slumped away from her sight\u2026Noon.The scourge woman was doing her usual routine, sitting upright on a rock, absorbing the sunshine one breath at a time.A sudden hubbub pierced her ears, disturbing her inner peace. With fire in her eyes, she marched to the source.She watched a throng of people raving, \u201cKill him, beat that lousy punk to death\u2026\u201dShe approached doubtfully and witnessed Zhuo Fan wrestling with a stocky 3rd layer Bone Tempering expert.She shook her head ready to leave, but Zhuo Fan yelled at the top of his lungs, \u201cI won\u2019t let you insult her! She is a good person\u2026\u201d\u201cScrew you! That scourge woman killed numerous people already and you still dare to take her side?\u201d The stocky man he was fighting against, punctuated his reproval with a slap.But Zhuo Fan was stubborn as a mule. He was mocked, roughed up, shamed, yet his eyes never lost their will to fight.\u201cHumph, she\u2019s been living here long since you came barging in. Before then, some people die to god knows what, and you people start slander the lady. Can you even call yourself a man?\u201d\u201cHey, this kid is asking for it. Finish him off!\u201d\u201cYeah, letting him live will invite disaster upon us. He is just like that scourge woman, wanting to kill us all. But before he kills us, we\u2019ll just have to take him out.\u201d\u201cKill, kill\u2026\u201d The crowd began chanting like madmen.The scourge woman saw this unfold with a shiver as anger started to well up in her eyes.\u201cStop!\u201dA crisp shout rang in their ears, even over the thunderous roars of the mob. They turned in shock then shivered in fear, staggering away.\u201cIt\u2019s the scourge woman! Watch out everyone! Or she\u2019ll infect you if she gets too close!\u201dIn an instant, the people around started to run off. Even that Bone Tempering expert dismounted Zhuo Fan\u2019s prone figure and fled in fear.The scourge woman walked straight to Zhuo Fan and helped him stand. She only eyed the crowd around them then brought him back to the plagued house.The mob sighed in relief and wiped their sweat as they watched them go.\u201cSplit the money!\u201dA sudden shout echoed. The people gathered around again and at the center, was a pile of glittering spirit stones.The dazzling show of light struck the core of everyone.\u201cDamn, this must be more than ten thousand! Wasn\u2019t that kid from a third rate clan? How did he get so rich?\u201d\u201cHey, stop poking your nose in others\u2019 business! Who cares if he wants you to beat him up as long as you get paid? This must be around fifty thousand spirit stones. That young master said each can take a thousand, not a stone more!\u201d\u201cHe-he-he, I got it. That fellow wants that scourge woman so he wanted us to make a play. He is playing with fire. Who in the hell would go after a woman plagued with disease?\u201dBam!But his words were welcomed with a flurry of blows. The man turned in shock at the angry stocky man.\u201cHe told you to not speak of this once you get your cut. If just one of you has loose tongues, all of us will end up dead!\u201d\u201cUh, what\u2019s so scary about a rich kid? Even if he might be from a second rate clan\u2026\u201dThe first guy was still trying to justify himself but the stocky man\u2019s slap left him traveling through the air, \u201cBastard, I told you to shut up. You can\u2019t even begin to imagine what that young lord will do to us if this gets found out!\u201dThe stocky man\u2019s inflamed fists trembled with fear, recalling the scene of a man turning to ashes before him.Zhuo Fan let only him witness the almighty power of fear. The others were oblivious to his devious and poisonous acts. Nonetheless, since this stocky man was the strongest among them, if he was scared, he would share the fear and keep his words in mind.In a flash, they clamped their mouths and left after taking their share of spirit stones\u2026On the other side, the scourge woman took Zhuo Fan to the broken-down house. A small bottle appeared in her hand after seeing his bruised up and bleeding body, she order in a rather cold voice, \u201cEat it!\u201dZhuo Fan knew it was a healing pill, but he turned his head away.How could those useless Bone Tempering men even dent his perfect 5th-grade demonic treasure body? His wounds were self-inflicted to stir pity in the scourge woman\u2019s heart.And if he just ate the pill, the woman would just take off. So he put up a tough front, like a spoiled brat.The woman, however, was perplexed, \u201cWhat, scared there\u2019s poison?\u201d\u201cI am not afraid of staying with you. Do you think I\u2019m afraid of you poisoning a pill?\u201d Zhuo Fan huffed, \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me to get lost? Why did you save me then?\u201dThe scourge woman eyed him deeply, \u201cThen, why did you still try to defend me before those people? Weren\u2019t you afraid of being beaten to death? If I had arrived just one second later, you\u2019d have died.\u201dZhuo Fan laughed inside. He knew that after a full night spent on absorbing the moon\u2019s yin, the following day would be used on absorbing the sun\u2019s yang to warm her meridians. If not, even the strongest of experts could not withstand the corrosive yin energy raining havoc through their body.When he did his rounds around the area, he knew the spot she picked for absorbing yang. It was all a matter of staging a good show with his fellow neighbors. Not even mild-tempered people could keep away from the ruckus once their meditation was interrupted.In layman\u2019s terms, it all went according to Zhuo Fan\u2019s foolproof plan to breach the scourge woman\u2019s psychological barriers and accept him with all her heart.Zhuo Fan turned his head and stared right in her eyes until her own eyes faltered away. He spoke with emotion, \u201cMy mother said, eyes are a window to one\u2019s soul. There\u2019s no way a person with such beautiful eyes possess an evil heart. And, you also let me stay, you definitely have a good heart. If those people slander you for murder, how could I stand by and not defend your name?\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s open bootlicking was filled with childish naivety, lacking the feeling of deception an adult would have. If a lady heard it, she wouldn\u2019t loathe this childish behavior, on the contrary, they would like it even more.That\u2019s the secret to capturing a woman\u2019s heart, not using flowery and sweet words, but to stir her motherly side.This epiphany came to him after talking with Dong Tianba. He used to feel Dong Tianba and Song Yu were simply mighty silk pants. Though their chasing skills were vile and repulsive, it still achieved results.Therefore, he was using the same methods. [It\u2019s true, the world is filled with wondrous trades. Everyone\u2019s a master in something!]The effect was obvious, the scourge woman\u2019s cheeks tinted red and snapped, \u201cSilver-tongued!\u201dBut the eyes, though, now showed acceptance![Thanks, brother Dong, thank you for teaching me the way of chasing!]Zhuo Fan secretly sighed, but his face was still etched with that childlike innocence as he laughed, \u201cSister, I know you for so long yet I haven\u2019t caught your name!\u201d\u201cHow is that long? We only saw each other three times!\u201d Rolling her eyes, the scourge woman mumbled, \u201cYou\u2026 call me sister Chuchu.\u201d\u201cYes, sister Chuchu!\u201dZhuo Fan put on a puppy-eyed face that made even him nauseous, but his hands were tied. Women ate them like candy.\u201cNow take the pill.\u201d Chuchu extended the bottle, but Zhuo Fan smiled and opened his mouth, \u201cSister Chuchu, feed me!\u201dSighing, Chuchu shook her head helpless, glared, but she still extended him a pill with her dainty hand.Zhuo Fan saw her hand approaching and grabbed her wrist suddenly, pouring in his Yuan Qi\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 - Amazing Alchemy SkillPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHis Yuan Qi didn\u2019t travel far as a sudden chill, caused by the yin power, broke his contact, and a thin layer of ice crystals formed on his hand.Zhuo Fan was in shock.This didn\u2019t come as a result of the terrible chill, since it belonged to the yin power of the moon. What startled him so was the poison the scourge woman was housing in her body.There were seven types of poison twisted inside, and each one of them was enough to leave a person dead as a doornail. As opposed to miraculous medicines, this was a certain death poison. With how the seven poison were twisted among each other, even a Radiant Stage expert would be in endless torment before dying.He didn\u2019t know anyone so vile and malicious that would administer such poison, but one thing he did know, the poison was far too strong to be suppressed by the moon\u2019s yin power alone.And there was one more thing Zhuo Fan found inside her body fighting off the seven poisons, a medicine; the Bodhi Jade Sap!With his eyes wide, Zhuo Fan\u2019s heart was in exultation.Bodhi Jade Sap was a miraculous medicine capable of reviving someone from an inch of death, a 7th, if not 8th-grade medicine. One drop was enough to save a mortally wounded person.And this was what Zhuo Fan\u2019s aim all along!Now, he was apathetic to the scourge woman\u2019s plight, only having eyes for the Bodhi Jade Sap to restore the Thunder Skylark egg.All that was left was to figure out how to get it out of her. This miraculous treasure wasn\u2019t a common topic he could discuss with her, it breached one\u2019s lifeline.\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s act was instantaneous and only now did she pull her dainty hand away and glared in fury.His eyes darting around, Zhuo Fan put on a sappy face, rubbing his hands in worry, \u201cSister Chuchu, your hand is so cold, let me warm you up!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t play with me!\u201dChuchu stared at him filled with doubt, \u201cSay it, why did you search me with Yuan Qi?\u201dZhuo Fan sighed, \u201cI noticed sister Chuchu\u2019s unwell complexion and since my clan is an alchemist clan, I thought of helping you. I didn\u2019t expect sister to doubt me\u2026\u201dZhuo Fan now sported a face filled with injustice, and even sniffed to drive the point in. It had the obvious effect and Chuchu\u2019s heart softened and her eyes no longer glared.\u201cMy injury isn\u2019t something a third rate clan can help with. But thank you.\u201d\u201cWho says that?\u201dZhuo Fan raised his head, like an indignant child, \u201cMy Song clan from Nightrain City have been alchemists for generations. My dad is a 3rd-grade alchemist and passed his teachings onto me. If you don\u2019t believe it, come and see my skills!\u201dZhuo Fan grabbed Chuchu\u2019s soft hand and went outside. Chuchu was so stunned she forgot to fight back.No matter what she was thinking, she didn\u2019t seem to want to cut at this big boy\u2019s enthusiasm.Zhuo Fan led Chuchu through some broken-down houses, to the fright of the new locals. Of course, most of them were in fear of the scourge woman while only one man felt dread from Zhuo Fan.He was the stocky man who witnessed Zhuo Fan\u2019s vicious methods!The pair arrived at the tavern where Dong Tianba stayed. In his rush before, he even left the Song carriage here. It contained the ingredients the Song clan readied for the meeting.\u201cBro!\u201dHe ran right into the Dong siblings. Dong Tianba was in glee while Dong Xiaowan gave a bashful nod, \u201cBig brother Song!\u201dYet, Dong Xiaowan felt something strange as she caught his hand holding Chuchu\u2019s wrist.Dong Tianba noticed this also and felt awkward, \u201cBro, who is she?\u201d\u201cSister Chuchu, a new friend!\u201d Zhuo Fan smiled.At his words, Dong Tianba dragged him to the side with a raised eyebrow, \u201cWait to go, bro! You got one just as you arrived!\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, it\u2019s all thanks to brother Dong!\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s words came from his heart. You\u2019d think a cultivation maniac like him would know how to get close to Chuchu if not for yesterday\u2019s long chat with this prodigal son?Stealing a glance at Chuchu, Dong Tianba gave a lustful grin, \u201cBro, is she hot? I can\u2019t tell from her clothes. But she should be hiding something amazing.\u201d\u201cUh, I\u2019m not sure since I never saw her body!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Dong Tianba cried out, \u201cNot even her face? And you want to bed her?\u201dZhuo Fan shrugged, \u201cDon\u2019t be like that. I don\u2019t look at her like that anyway.\u201dZhuo Fan brushed passed him, letting him stand dumbstruck, his brows furrowed in deep confusion, [If a man isn\u2019t after a woman for her body, then is it for love? When did my dear bro change so much?]\u201cBrother Dong, where\u2019s my carriage?\u201d Dong Tianba recovered only after he heard Zhuo Fan\u2019s yell. He replied, \u201cIn the back of the tavern. Come with me.\u201dDong Tianba led them out back and Zhuo Fan went right inside the carriage, beginning to take out all the glittering and odd ingredients.He didn\u2019t look at all serious, instead, he was as pure as a child.Chuchu found it normal, but the Dong siblings were startled. Where did the vicious and sinister Zhuo Fan of yesterday go?Dong Tianba then realized, [It seems that love can make a man go crazy. Bro, you are caught in a love trap!]Not minding the looks he got, Zhuo Fan met Chuchu\u2019s eyes and spoke with a boyish smile, \u201cSister Chuchu, watch closely!\u201dHis hand now held a scarlet Yuan Qi flame, throwing dozens of ingredients inside. Yet it was amazing how the ingredients didn\u2019t mix.\u201cWhat precise control!\u201d Dong Tianba exclaimed.A 3rd-grade alchemist could, at best, handle nine ingredients at once. But Zhuo Fan made light work of dozens. His skill went beyond the 4th grade, perhaps even 5th.4th-grade alchemists were seen only in second rate clans, 5th grade in first rate clans. As for those above, they were talents raised in the seven houses.Dong Tianba just couldn\u2019t believe it. When he met Song Yu again in this city, he discovered that not only did his power soared, but even his alchemy ability jumped.[If he had one iota of skill he shows today at the start, the Clan Head wouldn\u2019t have refused him.] Dong Xiaowan was watching him with an even more amazed expression.Chuchu nodded faintly, her eyes evoking praise. His skill at his age made Zhuo Fan a diamond in the rough!But Zhuo Fan wasn\u2019t going for just praise, he wanted shock. Only shock was enough to assure Chuchu of his alchemy ability and let him have the Bodhi Jade Sap.[Then, he-he-he\u2026]Zhuo Fan\u2019s eyes narrowed and gripped the scarlet flame containing the ingredients, putting it out. Only a weak trail of smoke was left behind.\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201dDong Tianba cried, \u201cI thought this guy improved but why does he suddenly lack common sense? If you forge all the ingredients together and put out the flame, you\u2019ll ruin them.\u201dChuchu shook her head with a light smile. [He is still a child. How can you refine with an unsteady heart?]Then, among the pitying gazes, Zhuo Fan smirked mysteriously, \u201cAs an alchemist, how can I not know when my pill is ruined? I don\u2019t need you to remind me!\u201dWith a smug smile, Zhuo Fan opened his hand.A piercing red light flashed and left behind a round red and glossy pill.\u201cH-how is this possible?\u201dDong Tianba was beyond shocked, not daring to even believe this was real. It went against all alchemical common sense.From the gloss and the fragrance, it denoted it as a 2nd-grade pill, but of top quality. It had a far greater value than any pill of the same grade.An apt description would be, a pill that jumped grades!Chuchu narrowed her eyes in shock. This was her first time witnessing such a skill.Zhuo Fan snickered inside. This refining method was called Universe Palm, taken from the Nine Serenities Secret Records. It preserved the ingredients\u2019 effects and even boosted the pill to top quality.It was no wonder those in the mortal domain were oblivious to it since not even the Sacred Domain was aware of its existence.How could mortals even begin to understand the secret methods of the ancients? It was all for the sake of getting that Bodhi Jade Sap, or Zhuo Fan wouldn\u2019t have revealed such a technique.To common folk, this secret art meant nothing, but to alchemists, they would rave over it. He\u2019d be inviting disaster if they knew of it.But these potential issues were for him to deal with in the future. All that mattered now was gaining Chuchu\u2019s trust.Zhuo Fan grinned as he brought the glossy red pill before Chuchu, \u201cSister Chuchu, I felt your hand freezing, so this Yang Pill is for you.\u201dChuchu raised her eyebrow, but mocked instead, \u201cI appreciate your kindness, but Yang Pill is a 2nd-grade pill. It has no effect on me!\u201d\u201cHow can you be certain if you haven\u2019t tried it yet?\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s cryptic smile left Chuchu in doubt, but she also knew this pill wasn\u2019t ordinary thanks to the special method he employed in refining it. She chose to take it after some muttering.Chuchu suddenly felt her body shivering, her eyes filled with shock. She had an expression that no one could decipher\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - Rainbow Cloud PalmPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d Chuchu exclaimed.That pill was unlike any she had taken. It dissolved in an instant into a miniature sun and caused her to let out a scorching breath.The strong pill effect traveled to every corner of her body, warming it up. When the effect faded, a comfortable feeling still lingered while also dispelling most of the yin power damaging her meridians she absorbed last night.Chuchu was incredulous such an astonishing pill existed in this world.Her Yuan Qi was of yin attribute, and normal yang attribute pills would be rendered useless. As such, a mere 2nd grade Yang Pill should have already been offset by her body before it could help dispel the moon\u2019s yin power inside her.But Zhuo Fan\u2019s pill was burning like the sun, yet it was gentle, nurturing the recovery of her meridians.The crux of it all was that her Yuan Qi didn\u2019t fight against it, allowing her to capitalize on the pill\u2019s entire effect.This went beyond even her wildest dreams!A pair of sparkling eyes stared at Zhuo Fan\u2019s.Zhuo Fan was gleeful inside as he smiled, \u201cHow is it, sister Chuchu? My pill is different from the rest.\u201dChuchu nodded unconsciously as she praised, \u201cYou are so young yet using such an enigmatic refining skill. In a few years, the entire empire will know your name.\u201d[He-he-he, it has already, though you don\u2019t know it yet!]Zhuo Fan cursed inside, but his face still evoked the same boyish smile, \u201cThen, sister Chuchu, if there\u2019s anything hurting your body, I will make it sure that it stops.\u201dChuchu jerked, Zhuo Fan\u2019s words struck a chord in her. She knew her own body all too well and needed a great alchemist to remove the poison. However\u2026Chuchu muttered to herself. Zhuo Fan was always watching her, his heart stretched taut. If his mind could be heard it would be like, [What\u2019s the hold-up?][Hurry up and fork that damn Bodhi Jade Sap over! If you don\u2019t have it, then point me in the right direction at least!]Then, a laugher suddenly resounded, \u201cHa-ha-ha, took you long enough. I\u2019ve been waiting here for a whole day, brat.\u201dTwo figures landed from the sky.One was dressed in red, the beautiful figure of the girl Zhuo Fan humiliated yesterday, Xiao Dandan. The other was a man, a handsome youth in green and with an eerie green flicker in his eye.Dong Tianba and his sister jumped in shock. Chuchu was also affected, staring at the two with a complicated gaze. While Zhuo Fan\u2019s expression was grave, his eyes glinting dangerously.[Son of a bitch! I almost had it! Your meddling warrants death!]Zhuo Fan was itching to snap these two\u2019s necks, but noticing Chuchu, [Forget it, I\u2019ll keep playing the naive child.]\u201cHe-he-he, punk, I heard you were quite strong\u2026\u201d\u201cSister Chuchu, they\u2019re picking on me. Beat them up!\u201dWhile the smug green youth was pointing at him, Zhuo Fan pulled on Chuchu\u2019s clothes. He was striking an uncanny resemblance to a younger brother bullied by others and asking his boss for help.This caused a widespread shock to all that knew of yesterday\u2019s affair. The green youth\u2019s face twitched, watching Xiao Dandan in skepticism, \u201cMiss Dandan, is he the one who was hard on you yesterday? Is he the same insufferably arrogant punk? Why is it he has not one bone in his back?\u201dXiao Dandan felt dizzy, [He wasn\u2019t like this before! he was even bossy with my senior aunt. Is he bipolar?]\u201cUh, young master Yan, he\u2026 is. But\u2026 he wasn\u2019t like this yesterday.\u201d\u201cHumph, whatever. Since he is the one, I will give him a reckoning for what happened to you.\u201d Snorting, he said to Zhuo Fan, \u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a spineless coward or a retard. Since you offended people from the seven houses, you deserve death. With how skilled and heavy-handed you were when dealing with Lin Tianyu, you are worthy of my personal involvement!\u201d\u201cYou beat Lin Tianyu? Weren\u2019t you weaker than even a third rate clan\u2019s disciple?\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s eyes darted everywhere, then gave an embarrassed smile, \u201cUh, if I say he tripped and hurt himself, would you believe me?\u201dEveryone almost lost balance and collapsed.[Dude, can\u2019t you come up with a more realistic lie?]Chuchu smiled out of anger, \u201cSong Yu, if you admit you lied to me from the start, I can still forgive you. But you are clearly taking me for a fool.\u201dChuchu brushed her sleeve and vanished, leaving only her angry voice in his ear, \u201cHumph, since you court it, you deal with it!\u201d\u201cSister Chuchu, let me explain\u2026\u201d Zhuo Fan trailed but she was gone.When Zhuo Fan turned around, his eyes were cold and deadly. His previous cute and adorable look was gone, replaced with murderous desire.\u201cYou bastard, couldn\u2019t you wait a minute more? You ruined my plan!\u201dZhuo Fan\u2019s tone carried a vicious desire for revenge, making Xiao Dandan shiver as she hid behind the green youth. Even the youth held a serious expression.From being in contact with so many people from the seven houses, it was easy to figure out a man\u2019s nature from a single glance. But Zhuo Fan\u2019s naked killing intent made his judgment moot. Such savagery only came from the kind of beast.\u201cHumph, from how tough you act, it is no wonder that you dealt a heavy blow to Lin Tianyu!\u201d The green youth mocked, \u201cToo bad you met me, Pill King Hall, Vicious Pill King, Yan Song\u2019s head disciple, Yan Fu! I am unlike that trash from Merry Woods who indulges in lust. I am the Vicious Pill King\u2019s successor!\u201dZhuo Fan frowned. Vicious Pill King was the title of the best alchemist in Pill King Hall.But the first in Pill King Hall wasn\u2019t like the first in any other clans.To some clans, their number one alchemist title was gained by being the best in alchemy. But in Pill King Hall, it not only represented alchemy but also concocting poison unlike any other.From this his title, Vicious Pill King. It could be said that he was the mightest killer and savior in the world. With life and death in his hands, he became known as a true Pill King![In other words, this kid\u2019s good at poisons. Humph!]Zhuo Fan mocked inside. Poison might inconvenience the rest, but to him it had no effect.[See how I use my Demon Transformation Art and wring your cultivation dry!]With a crack of lightning, Zhuo Fan appeared before Yan Fu.The shock Yan Fu felt was palpable, not expecting the 1st layer of Bone Tempering Stage cultivator to employ such speed. It was no wonder that Merry Woods\u2019 disciple who despite his focus on speed lost so badly.Yet before he could react, Zhuo Fan kicked him in the stomach.Spewing blood, Yan Fu flew out, making a human-shaped hole in the wall around the tavern and bounced fifty meters in the street.Everyone was slack jawed.To be honest, if not for Zhuo Fan\u2019s irritated state, he would\u2019ve toned it down.Casting a side glance at Xiao Dandan, she was scared out of her wits. Zhuo Fan sneered, \u201cNo matter who you call, they\u2019ll all end the same. Do you women from Drifting Flowers Edifice can only rely on men? Ha-ha-ha\u2026\u201dZhuo Fan walked away and left her crying, feeling wronged.Zhuo Fan\u2019s contempt and harsh tone cut deep into her. It was no longer humiliation, but despise!Going through the broken wall, Zhuo Fan walked towards Yan Fu, who was getting up. The tavern\u2019s customers and the bystanders hid when they saw it was a fight involving the seven houses.\u201cHe-he-he, quite fast, the fastest beneath Profound Heaven Stage I reckon.\u201d Yan Fu sneered as he wiped the blood from his mouth.Zhuo Fan snickered, \u201cWell this is a first, seeing one happy to be beaten.\u201d\u201cHumph, I am happy, but of certain victory.\u201d\u201cVictory?\u201d Zhuo Fan disdained, \u201cI know Pill King Hall can make pills as well as poisons. But you think you can beat me with poisons?\u201d\u201cHa-ha-ha, debased punk, you know nothing of the world!\u201dYan Fu\u2019s eyes flashed as he laughed, \u201cMy master is Vicious Pill King, revered by all. If not for his poisons, why do you think the seven houses fear him?\u201dYan Fu spread his arms.A mist flew from his palms that gradually changed its color, soon letting out three different types of light.Red, yellow, and green interweaved.Zhuo Fan scratched his nose, feeling slightly numb.[Crud, this punk\u2019s poison skills are good to the point that even I have been affected.] He was cursing inside, however, Zhuo Fan had a calm expression on the outside.\u201cHe-he-he, have a taste of Pill King Hall\u2019s legacy profound ranked martial art, Rainbow Cloud Palm!\u201dSilavin: 14 Chapters a week again.
