Has your Blood Qi Value reached 0.8?!\u201dLu Sheng lowered his head, rubbing his puffy temples while obediently listening to the class teacher\u2019s scolding.A little fatty sitting on his left-hand side secretly turned his head and looked at him.\u201cDid you have another nightmare?\u201dLu Sheng nodded, without speaking, but his eyes were filled with a strong sense of helplessness.He had been dreaming the same dream for the last three days consecutively and very often.Lu Sheng wasn\u2019t able to describe the dream, but he could only remember that the scenery in the dream was extremely dilapidated, desolate and depressing.He stood bewildered on top of a wasteland with monsters roaming everywhere\u2026It was a nightmare.Lu Sheng was absolutely certain of it.Because after experiencing this dream, he becomes very drowsy, and his sleep quality too was abysmal.Despite sleeping for more than a dozen hours a day, his body\u2019s state was the same as if he had suffered from insomnia continuously.So much so that during the past three days, Lu Sheng\u2019s Blood Qi Value had decreased by 0.02!0.02\u2026How many pills will be needed to be consumed, and how many days of hard work will it take to make up for it?Lu Sheng was in a terrible mood.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014After school, Lu Sheng lethargically walked out of school carrying his bag.At that moment, someone came from behind, calling his name and blocked his path.\u201cLu Sheng, how about going to a net cafe?\u201dIt was the little fatty in the classroom earlier.His name was Liu Qiming, and he could be considered as one of Lu Sheng\u2019s very few friends.Faced with Liu Qiming\u2019s invitation, Lu Sheng shook his head.\u201cNo, I won\u2019t come, I am going home.\u201d\u201cGoing home so early? It\u2019s not like your style. Let\u2019s go to the net cafe, I\u2019ll pay for all the drinks and internet fees today.\u201dLiu Qiming patted his chest and invited earnestly.But Lu Sheng still shook his head and explained, \u201cI really don\u2019t feel like going, I want to go home early and make up for my lack of sleep.\u201d\u201cYou slept all day in class today, but you\u2019re still sleepy?\u201dLiu Qiming had an exaggerated expression on his face.Lu Sheng didn\u2019t bother to explain, he waved his hand and started walking forward.Liu Qiming intended on persuading him again, however, several boys dashed over right then.\u201cLiu Qiming, are you coming to the net cafe or not?\u201d\u201cComing, coming, right away!\u201dLiu Qiming looked at Lu Sheng one last time and didn\u2019t say anything else, leaving Lu Sheng behind to run towards the other boys.Lu Sheng watched Liu Qiming leaving from behind, as students in black and blue school uniforms passed by him on both sides.They were rushing towards the school\u2019s entrance, dispersing rapidly as they neared, like a muddy river flowing past the hustle and bustle.Whew-Lu Sheng let out a soft sigh as thoughts began to churn in his mind.He practically forgot that he had been living in this world for almost eighteen years.Lu Sheng\u2019s memories of his previous life were now very vague, and sometimes he even wondered if it was all just a dream.A dream that he has been having over and over again ever since he was a child.Similar to the one he keeps on dreaming about recently.\u201cNo home\u2026 no car\u2026 alone\u2026 a white coat\u2026 hiking\u2026 falling off a cliff\u2026 waking up\u2026\u201dLu Sheng murmured under his breath one keyword after another, as his eyes gradually grew empty and distant until he recited the last word.\u201cCrossing\u2026\u201dThat\u2019s right, Lu Sheng had crossed over.In that world of his previous life, there were no martial arts, and there were no monsters that came out of cracks in the earth.The TV newscasts also didn\u2019t broadcast monster attacks or martial arts duels.What gave the students in school a headache was not the Blood Qi Value, Combat Power Index, or even the Practical Combat Class results, instead it was the endless math, science and foreign language tests.Sometimes Lu Sheng missed that world because at least it was\u2026Quiet and peaceful.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014Lu Sheng pushed open the door to his home.He saw his dad, Lu Dahai, laying topless on the armrest of the sofa, while his mother, Zheng Yufen, was applying a plaster, trying to find a suitable spot on Lu Dahai\u2019s back.Lu Sheng noticed his dad\u2019s \u201cpatched up\u201d back, his eyes ached for a moment, and then he shouted, \u201cI\u2019m home.\u201d\u201cAre you hungry? Have an apple first, I\u2019ll make dinner soon.\u201dZheng Yufen said while she was putting the plaster on Lu Dahai\u2019s body, as she pressed it into place.Lu Sheng shook his head and dragged his bag towards his room.Stopping midway, he turned his head towards the sofa and murmured, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go and buy a Qi massage device, that can stimulate the Qi flow, relax and activate the muscles, the massage is also very useful for healing injuries. My classmate\u2019s family has one\u2026\u201d\u201cHey, where am I injured? I\u2019ll be better in a few days. It\u2019ll be better to save the money to buy pills for you\u2026\u201dLu Dahai quickly dismissed Lu Sheng\u2019s proposal, struggling to turn his head to look at him.\u201cHow is your Blood Qi Value lately? Have you exceeded 0.85 yet? I saw on the news today that the Blood Qi Value for this year\u2019s college entrance test undergraduate score line has been increased by 0.01\u2026\u201d\u201cI know, I\u2019ll go back to my room to practice now\u2026\u201dHearing this, Lu Sheng\u2019s heart clenched, and he fled into his room in a rush.His heart was too weak.If Lu Dahai knew that his recent Blood Qi Value had not only not improved, but even decreased, he would immediately leap up from the sofa with his shoe and smack him hard.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2: Defense Team Zombies?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLu Sheng closed the door to his room and let out a little sigh of relief.Only in this small room, that belonged to him alone, did he feel at ease.The room was small, with a single bed and a desk in the corner.In the center was a 2\u00d71.5 black yoga mat, surrounded by dumbbells, grip strengtheners, sandbags and other workout equipment.This was Lu Sheng\u2019s martial arts practice and rest room.Lu Sheng put down his school bag, took off his uniform and then sat down on the yoga mat.The reason he returned immediately after school was, in fact, to do more practice; in order to make up for the decrease in his Blood Qi Value caused by the nightmares over the past two days.He was at an age where every part of his body was developing rapidly and his Blood Qi Value should be soaring.Unless someone was severely injured or ill, it would be nearly impossible for their Blood Qi Value to decrease.Thus, what happened to Lu Sheng was extremely serious and needed to be addressed immediately, so it could be controlled.After calming himself down, Lu Sheng took a deep breath and silently recited in his mind, \u201cThe 13th set of radio exercise*, start!\u201d[*Warm-up exercise performed to music and guidance from radio broadcasts.]Then, Lu Sheng, with his body began to perform from one form after another.These forms were somewhat similar to yoga, but they were also very much different from yoga, using gymnastics to describe them was rather fitting.\u201cThe Global Martial Union\u2019s 24th Form of Body Refining Technique is said to have been created by the masters of the Union based on ancient yoga, ancient martial arts, ancient jujitsu, etc. It\u2019s most suitable for giving beginners in martial arts a foundation.\u201d\u201cThe one I am practising now is the 13th modified and revised version, and its effects are several times better than the original version\u2026\u201dEver since the world changed drastically more than three hundred years ago, when a rift appeared in the sky and on the ground causing a large number of strange and terrifying monsters to emerge, the trajectory of the world\u2019s development had changed completely.After most of the thermal weapons failed to be effective in fighting the monsters, human beings began to look for new ways and methods to defend themselves.Perhaps due to the emergence of monsters, faced with the tremendous threat of mass extinction, a certain genetic lock in the human body was broken, allowing individual strength to easily rise to a level that was previously unthinkable.Thus martial arts began to rise.As martial arts began to develop at a rapid pace, advancing with each passing day.At present, it had become a social trend for everyone to practice martial arts and work hard to cultivate.But even so, on the battlefield with the monsters fighting for habitable space, humans were still at an absolute disadvantage, with news of cities falling almost every day and the human population continuing to plummet.\u201cYou were born in an era of chaos, you must shoulder the responsibilities of this era.\u201d\u201cYou are practising martial arts for the sake of humanity\u2019s rise, each and every one of you is a spark in the martial path\u2026\u201dThis is what the class teacher told Lu Sheng and the other students from time to time\u2026\u2014 \u2014 \u2014Whew!Lu Sheng stopped moving his body and sat on the yoga mat to slowly regulate his breathing.He performed the 24th form of the Body Refining Technique three times in a single breath, a thin layer of sweat emerged from his body, and his formerly pale face became a little more flushed.\u2018If the nightmares stop, one week should be enough to make up for the decrease in Blood Qi Value\u2026\u2019Lu Sheng thought quietly in his mind.So far, Lu Sheng has not found the cause of his nightmares.He used his phone to look up information on the internet. There are generally 4 causes of nightmares: Sleeping position, diet, illness and psychosis.The first 3 factors could be ruled out. So, could it be due to the psychological stress caused by the approaching college entrance exams?Lu Sheng wasn\u2019t sure.In theory, with two lifetimes of experience in college entrance exams, his mental capacity should be much better than that of a normal person.But that didn\u2019t seem to be the case.Lu Sheng relaxed while wandering wildly.As he was thinking, drowsiness came in slowly like a tidal wave.Lu Sheng unconsciously yawned, his eyelids drooped, and his body slowly slumped as he gradually fell asleep\u2026\u2014 \u2014 \u2014Ashy sky, brown ground, a hint of grey mist spreading everywhere.Depression, despair, desolate\u2026This was the first thing Lu Sheng saw upon waking up.\u201cIt\u2019s the same nightmare again\u2026\u201dLu Sheng felt completely helpless.\u201cWake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up\u2026\u201dHe tugged violently at his arms and face skin, trying to wake himself up from the nightmare, but to no avail.Unless a certain time was reached, he would remain within the nightmare.Ugh~ Ugh~ Ugh~A strange sound came to his ears as if someone was choking, accompanied by a rustling and dragging sound.\u201cHere it comes\u2026\u201dA wail went through Lu Sheng\u2019s head.Very quickly, the grey mist not far on his left dispersed, and a tall, stiff humanoid figure appeared right in front of him.The humanoid figure\u2019s complexion was pale, the eye sockets were sunken, and there were no eyeballs, only a pair of empty holes.There was a long slit on the face, which allowed him to clearly see the greyish white facial bones as well as the dark flesh and blood.The humanoid figure was stiff and sluggish, wearing a uniform similar to the defence team\u2019s uniform, but it was very filthy, covered in dirt.Nearly identical to the zombies in movies that Lu Sheng had seen in his previous life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How can I be afraid of a mere zombie?\u201dAccording to the Global Martial Arts Union standard, Blood Qi Value of a level 1 martial artist is 1.5, and Combat Power Index 150, Lu Sheng can now be considered almost a half-standard martial artist.Although Lu Sheng\u2019s performance in the practical combat class was poor and he only knew a few simple fighting techniques, it didn\u2019t affect his current momentum in the slightest.\u201cWind-Spirit Kick!\u201dLu Sheng shouted the name of a technique he had read in a novel in his previous life, and accelerated his running speed for a moment, then kicked the tall zombie in the chest.The tall zombie stumbled back several steps, its clumsy body became unstable under the huge impact and fell to the ground on its back.A clear 41.5-size shoe print was left on its uniform.\u201cLooks like that\u2019s it\u2026.\u201dWith the kick landed, Lu Sheng\u2019s confidence increased instantly.He saw the tall zombie in the uniform struggling to get up again and immediately went up to finish the job.Lu Sheng punched the tall zombie in the face twice with his bare fists.His fists felt like it smashed into a dry coconut shell, and the back of Lu Sheng\u2019s hand started to hurt.Lu Sheng grimaced while looking around for tools that he could use.Soon he found a stone the size of a watermelon a few meters away.Lu Sheng grabbed the stone and aimed it at the tall zombie\u2019s head.\u201cIn movies, the zombie\u2019s head is always the weak spot, this should work\u2026\u201dLu Sheng mumbled under his breath, and his hands stretched hard.Crack-The crisp sound of a nose bone breaking.The watermelon-sized stone was lodged into the face of the tall zombie, and the tall zombie\u2019s body twitched twice before it went completely motionless.\u201cIt\u2019s done\u2026\u201dLu Sheng confirmed that the tall zombie was completely dead, and only then sat down on his butt and took a deep breath.Needless to say, this dream was very vivid.Lu Sheng could even hear the sound of his heart beating violently.\u201cStill not waking up\u2026\u201dLu Sheng muttered and was about to stand up.Just then, he watched the tall zombie in front of him crumble like rubble, weathering and disappearing in just a few seconds.And there were wisps of black threads of smoke steaming out from within the weathered corpse of the tall zombie, viciously scurrying into Lu Sheng\u2019s chest like arrows.\u201cUgh!\u201dLu Sheng was stunned. Before he could even react, he felt a hot stream emanating from his chest, along with a large number of fragmented memories, like a movie screen, rapidly crossing through his mind.[- What do you want to do after graduation?\u2013 Join the base defense team.\u2013 I heard that the defense team training is very tough and dangerous.\u2013 It\u2019s fine, it has always been my dream. (Laughs)\u2013 From now on, you\u2019ll be a member of the 1359th base defense team, No. YH48549.\u2013 Yes, sir! I will not let you down! (Excited)\u2013 Breathing Techniques, and Body Refining Techniques; these two things that you\u2019ve been taught, practice them when you eat, when you sleep, and even when you go to the toilet! If you get stronger, you\u2019ll have more chances to survive when you encounter the foreign monsters.\u2013 Understood, sir!\u2013 Team 2! Team 2! Team 3\u2026 damnit, where is everyone? Are they all dead? Stop! Who are you?\u2013 No. YH48549. Sir!\u2013 What are you doing here? What team are you from?\u2013 Reporting sir, team 7.\u2013 At once! Send your captain to see me!\u2013 Reporting\u2026 sir, the captain and his men\u2026 they\u2019re all dead. I\u2019m the only one left in team 7.

    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: Inherited, Combat Skills!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWhy did I get his memories even though I killed him\u2026 ? Is it because it\u2019s in a dream?\u201dMany doubts arose in Lu Sheng\u2019s mind.Unfortunately, there was no one to answer his questions, he could only find the answer to everything by himself.Lu Sheng collected his thoughts and started walking in the barren wilderness.Soon, a few more wandering zombies appeared before Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes.These zombies were wearing dirty and tattered straps, one of them was wearing a yellow helmet on its head, which looked a lot worse than the previous uniform zombies.This time Lu Sheng wasn\u2019t afraid and charged towards the zombie wearing the yellow helmet.Crack-A forward dash plus an arm twist, Lu Sheng simply snapped the opponent\u2019s neck.Looking at the head of the zombie that rolled to his feet like a worn football, Lu Sheng froze for a moment.He looked at his hands, feeling disbelieved.\u201cWhen did I become\u2026 so strong?\u201dLu Sheng recalled the chain of movements he had just performed.As if he had already used it countless times in real battles, it was almost instinctive and he just did it subconsciously.That kind of precision and ruthlessness was a realm he didn\u2019t even dare to think about before.\u201cCould it be because I absorbed the memories of that uniform zombie\u2026?\u201dLu Sheng was trying to analyze.The uniform zombie seemed to be a combatant at a base called Base 1359 before he died, although his strength wasn\u2019t exactly strong, he had experienced many battles and had extensive experience in real combat.Lu Sheng absorbed his memories, naturally also inherited a portion of his skills.\u201cIt\u2019s almost unbelievable\u2026\u201dLu Sheng couldn\u2019t help but sigh, \u201cTo obtain someone else\u2019s lifelong experience with such ease, if only this wasn\u2019t a dream\u2026\u201dJust because it was a dream, whatever unimaginable things happened seemed ordinary.To put it bluntly, Lu Sheng had clearly realized that he was dreaming, but he just couldn\u2019t wake up.At that moment, the zombie Lu Sheng had just killed in one move also began to weather, the same black thread of smoke emerged from its body penetrating into Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng hurriedly absorbed a part of its memory.This time the memories left Lu Sheng a little disappointed.The helmet zombie was just an ordinary plumber before he died, the memories that interested Lu Sheng were few if any.The only thing of value from the memories of the helmet zombie was probably that he and the uniform zombie had supposedly come from the same place \u2013 Base 1359.\u201cLooks like I need to find this Base 1359, maybe there I can find the answer to the truth behind this dream\u2026\u201dLu Sheng thought to himself.He was now completely treating this dream as an Open World RPG type game.Hunting the zombies roaming around the wilderness would provide him with the necessary experience to \u201cupgrade\u201d and the clues to proceed to the next step.As for what the clues point to, Lu Sheng had no idea nor did he care.He was simply killing time to make this nightmare a little more interesting and less torturous.\u201cIf I want to upgrade more quickly, I will have to find combat class zombies to hunt, their memories will be of more use to me\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd as for how to distinguish between combatants and non-combatants, looking at their clothes will do the trick\u2026\u201dLu Sheng cleared his mind and quickened his pace, then began to pick his hunting targets selectively.Lu Sheng ran through the wilderness for a while and soon encountered the same combatant zombies as the first zombie he had killed, wearing a similar uniform as the defense team.Since he didn\u2019t care about getting injured or even dying, Lu Sheng charged towards the zombie without any concerns.This zombie looked a little more advanced than the first one with a weapon in its hand.A meter long rusty iron rod, the tip was cracked, and it wasn\u2019t possible to tell exactly what kind of weapon it was.Grrr-The zombie saw Lu Sheng and immediately let out an unpleasant growl, before slowly lifting the iron rod in his hand to strike at Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng dodged the strike with a nimble duck, then closed in on the other side and stabbed the opponent in the throat with a fierce elbow strike.Crack-A clear crunch of the neck breaking was heard.The head of the iron rod zombie snapped backwards at a weird angle, and Lu Sheng knocked it down with a single punch, then he grabbed the iron rod from his opponent\u2019s hand and quickly stabbed it in the head.Once! Twice!As the iron rod zombie\u2019s body began to weather, it signaled that the battle had ended.A black thread of smoke penetrated into Lu Sheng\u2019s body.\u201cBase\u2026 falling\u2026 dead\u2026 doomsday\u2026 ember\u2026\u201dLu Sheng slowly opened his eyes.This time, the memory absorption provided him with a large amount of skills and experience about the weapon \u2013 spear, but other than that it was quite confusing.Lu Sheng guessed that this guy had probably gone insane before he died.From time to time, the images he saw flashed all kinds of strange-looking monsters, and the memories were drenched in a strong sense of despair and depression.\u201cLet\u2019s keep moving\u2026\u201dLu Sheng sorted out the memories and picked up the weapon he just obtained; an iron rod, to be precise it was a broken spear, and prepared to continue exploring.But at that moment, a muffled sound rang in his ears.Bang! Bang! Bang-With that sound, everything around Lu Sheng started to turn illusory and erratic.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014The sound of a door slamming violently woke up Lu Sheng.He struggled to open his eyes as he slowly got up from his yoga mat.Then he heard a clear and cold female voice come in from outside the door.\u201cDinner is ready! How long are you going to stay cooped up in your room\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5: Lu Qinghe, Big Appetite!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was the voice of his sister, Lu Qinghe.Lu Sheng could imagine Lu Qinghe\u2019s current expression outside the door to his room.There was a trace of impatience within the coldness.Lu Qinghe had always despised him as a brother.Lu Sheng was about to turn 18 this year, but his Blood Qi Value was still 0.8 (declined to 0.78 in the past few days), Combat Power Index and Practical Combat class results were also a complete mess. His total grades were notably below average even within Beihai No.3 Middle School, which was already considered as a sub-par establishment within Beihai City.With such grades, Lu Sheng\u2019s college entrance exam score wouldn\u2019t be enough for even an undergraduate line.But Lu Qinghe was different.She had just turned 16 this year, but her last Blood Qi Value test had already exceeded 1.0, her Combat Power Index was over 100, and she was also very talented in Practical Combat.She currently attends the best High School No.1 for geniuses in Beihai City.Following this trend, it would be possible for her to get a scholarship for a major Martial Arts University in two years.To sum up in one sentence.Lu Qinghe is a prodigy, with extraordinary talent.Compared to Lu Qinghe, Lu Sheng was as mediocre as trash.The cliche combo of a mediocre brother and a genius sister.Although the Lu family didn\u2019t favor one child more than the other based on the differences in martial arts talent, Lu Sheng felt that this was exactly the reason why he and Lu Qinghe have always had a bad relationship.Perhaps in Lu Qinghe\u2019s heart, if there wasn\u2019t the burden of her mediocre brother, she could have gotten all the family resources poured into her right now, and she could have reached an even greater level.\u201cGot it, be right there.\u201dLu Sheng answered, and the knocking outside came to an immediate stop.At that moment, Lu Sheng also regained his lucidity, and he became aware that he had just experienced another nightmare.But unlike in the past, this time, after the nightmare Lu Sheng didn\u2019t feel any sense of discomfort anywhere.Instead\u2026His physical condition was unexpectedly good.\u201cNo sense of fatigue, no drowsiness, my whole body feels like it\u2019s full of energy\u2026\u201dLu Sheng was a little surprised.He tried to remember everything he had experienced in the dream.A few moments later, Lu Sheng was shocked.\u201cAll those memories\u2026 those memories that I got from the zombies, I still remember them all vividly. The numerous combat skills that I inherited are all still deeply engraved into my muscle memory, so much so that\u2026\u201dLu Sheng swung his fist in the air.\u201cEven my strength feels like it has increased\u2026\u201dThis was especially unbelievable!It should be noted that strength stems from the Qi.The increase in physical strength would inevitably be the result of a rise in Qi.If Lu Sheng felt that his strength had increased, wouldn\u2019t that mean his Blood Qi Value had also increased?\u2018The Blood Qi Value can be increased like this through dreams?\u2019\u2018Unbelievable!\u2019Lu Sheng couldn\u2019t believe it, doubting that these were all just his own delusions.Naturally, the most direct way to verify whether it was real or not would be to go and do a full physical test.\u201cLet\u2019s eat first, then I\u2019ll go and find a martial arts training center to test it\u2026\u201dLu Sheng quickly calmed down his excitement, cleaned up a bit, then walked out of his room.In his two lives, the only thing that made Lu Sheng better than his peers would probably be his calm and steady mindset.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014Lu Sheng buried his head and gulped rice into his mouth, as if he had been starving for days.As he picked up the empty bowl he ate clean, handing it to his mother Zheng Yufen to ask for another bowl, he suddenly noticed that the three people at the dinner table were looking at him in a strange way.Only then did Lu Sheng realize that\u2026The amount of food he ate today does indeed seem to be excessive.\u201cForget it, I\u2019m full.\u201dLu Sheng hesitated for a moment and was about to take the bowl back.But it was snatched away by Lu Dahai.\u201cWhat do you mean, how can you stay hungry at home? Wife, please go and cook another pot of rice and stir-fry two more dishes.\u201dMother Zheng Yufen nodded and then stood up and left.Lu Dahai looked rather pleased, looking at Lu Sheng with a smile, as he said, \u201cBoys tend to be like this when they are growing, they never feel full no matter how much they eat. The head goes up\u2026\u201d\u201cI will go out and buy some pills tomorrow, the development period is a great time to increase the Blood Qi Value, don\u2019t waste it\u2026\u201dLu Sheng nodded his head.\u201cHow much can it be increased? He\u2019ll be 18 soon\u2026\u201dNext to him, Lu Qinghe shoved a piece of roasted pork into her mouth, chewing it while making a disdainful noise.Lu Dahai glared at her and said, \u201cDon\u2019t keep discouraging your brother, being able to increase by even a little is a good thing. Those who graduate from Wuhan University with an undergraduate degree and a junior college degree are treated completely differently\u2026\u201dLu Qinghe skewed her lips, but didn\u2019t say anything.Lu Sheng kept silent.To be honest, the amount of food he ate this evening was a shock to even himself.He ate seven bowls of rice, and still didn\u2019t feel full.Mind the fact that Lu Qinghe usually only eats five bowls of rice.And Lu Qinghe\u2019s Blood Qi Value was higher than Lu Sheng\u2019s by a whole 0.2, and she consistently ate twice as much as Lu Sheng.\u2018Maybe the Blood Qi Value has really increased, and it isn\u2019t just my delusions\u2026\u2019Lu Sheng secretly thought in his mind.Mother Zheng Yufen quickly stir-fried another two meat dishes and served them up, Lu Sheng ate two more bowls of rice, then said a quick goodbye to his family and directly headed out the door.He couldn\u2019t wait to test his current values in all aspects.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Besides, since I can absorb memories and martial arts from the zombies in the dreams, I don\u2019t really need such training\u2026\u201dLu Sheng thought, striding into the Hongchuan Martial Arts Hall.At the front door of the martial arts school was a reception desk. The receptionist was a girl of around 20 years old, appearing quite beautiful.Seeing Lu Sheng, the girl quickly put on a professional smile and took the initiative to greet him, \u201cIs this student here to enrol in our martial arts hall\u2019s martial arts training classes?\u201dLu Sheng shook his head, \u201cNo, I\u2019m here to test my Blood Qi Value and Combat Power Index.\u201dGenerally, martial arts halls provide such assessment services, the results of which are similar to those in schools, and the cost also isn\u2019t too high.The receptionist girl swept a glance at the school uniform Lu Sheng was wearing, gave a nod, then said, \u201cAlright, please wait a moment.\u201dBased on her discernment, she could naturally see that Lu Sheng was one of those kids from an ordinary family, so there would be no point in wasting her time on him.\u201cGo down the hallway and proceed to room 8, there are devices for the test inside. Do you know how to operate them? Or do you need me to get someone to help you?\u201dThe receptionist girl had a fairly good attitude and didn\u2019t look down on Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng stated that he could, then took the rental card given by the receptionist girl and followed her directions to the specialised testing room.The device for testing the Blood Qi Value was somewhat similar to a printer, with a small notch at the bottom and a disposable sterile sampling needle placed next to it.Lu Sheng opened the sampling needle, took a little blood from the tip of his left middle finger, and then put it in the notch on the device.A faint blue light appeared on the crimson blood, then the device emitted a soft \u201cbeep\u201d sound, and a value popped up on the device\u2019s screen.[0.963]The Blood Qi Value was accurate to the last three decimal digits.When Lu Sheng saw the value, he couldn\u2019t help but clench his fist firmly even though he had already anticipated it.The Blood Qi Value had really increased!And the increase wasn\u2019t small.It went up by 0.18, nearly 0.2.Moreover, this was only the result of him hunting three zombies in his dream.\u2018This proves that everything I obtained in that dream can really be brought to reality\u2026 This is no longer just a game of killing monsters and levelling up, instead\u2026\u2019\u2018It\u2019s true cultivation!\u2019Lu Sheng held back his excitement.Nobody would be willing to be mediocre, especially him, who had already lived a mediocre life.Now that he finally saw a glimpse of hope that could allow him to shine in the martial arts world, how could he not be excited and delighted?\u201cLet\u2019s measure the Combat Power Index now.\u201dThe device for testing Combat Power was much bigger, almost as tall as a person, and in the middle of the device was a padded groove.The test only required punching hard at the groove.\u2018The memories of the uniform zombie contain techniques for punching, let\u2019s give it a try\u2026\u2019Lu Sheng wasn\u2019t sure how strong those two jumpsuit zombies he killed were when they were alive, but they were definitely stronger than the current him.And the skills and experience they had accumulated through numerous hard training and battles during their lifetime were undoubtedly an even greater treasure to the current him.Phew!Lu Sheng took a deep breath, and his right arm muscles followed the trajectory of the techniques in his memory, and he threw a ferocious punch at the force measuring device.Boom!A number popped up on the force measuring device.[113]The Combat Power Index had reached 113.It had already exceeded the standard Combat Power Index as represented by his 0.96 Blood Qi Value.This should be the bonus of the skill.Then Lu Sheng tested punching with his left arm as well, the value was a little less than his right arm, but it was also over 100.After several tests, Lu Sheng finally pulled back his punches with satisfaction.\u201cLast year, the undergraduate martial arts score line in Beihai City for Blood Qi Value was 1.05, and the Combat Power Index was 105.\u201d\u201cIn other words, now I have almost reached the standard for the undergraduate line.\u201d\u201cEven if I can\u2019t enter the dream anymore, I will be able to safely enter any of the No. 2 Martial Arts University after the college entrance exam in just 200 days.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Forget it, let\u2019s do some exercise first, and when my body is tired, I\u2019ll naturally fall asleep\u2026\u201dLu Sheng looked at the time and eventually decided to do some pre-bedtime exercise.The exercise was naturally the 24 Forms of Body Refining, which he called the 13th set of radio exercises.\u201cIt just so happens that my Blood Qi Value has increased a lot and it needs to be consolidated\u2026\u201dScientific research has shown that the human body\u2019s Blood Qi Value is not constant, it has a peak and a plateau point.When you exercise vigorously or take pills, the Blood Qi Value will peak temporarily.And when you are resting, or are sick or injured, the Blood Qi Value will decline to the bottom.Therefore, martial artists generally need to perform a series of high-intensity exercises after taking pills to ensure a permanent increase in Blood Qi Value in order to maximise the effectiveness of the pills; it was considered common sense.Lu Sheng\u2019s Blood Qi Value had increased by a whole 0.18 today, so appropriate exercise was essential.\u201c1st form\u2026\u201dLu Sheng followed the 24 Forms of Body Refining that he had done countless times on the yoga mat and started practising late at night.[PR/N: According to the author, 7 pm is a time late at night to practice but still too early to go to bed.]But not long after the practice, Lu Sheng felt that something was wrong.\u201cWait\u2026 how can I perform movements like this?\u201dLu Sheng suddenly stopped his movements with a slightly strange expression.He had been practising the 13th version of the 24 Forms of Body Refining Technique released by the Martial Union since elementary school, having practised for more than 7 years, it had become almost instinctive, and he could do the movements even with his eyes closed.Although it wasn\u2019t at the standard, at least it wasn\u2019t wrong.But just now, he distinctly felt himself subconsciously performing a different set of movements.And that set of movements was something he had never learned before.\u201cI see\u2026\u201dLu Sheng quickly understood what was wrong.He had absorbed the memories of martial arts from the two uniform zombies, and alongside their combat skills and experience, he had also inherited the memories of their practice.And what he had just performed was the Body Refining Technique that the two uniform zombies had practised repeatedly during their lives!\u201cThe Body Refining Technique of the uniform zombies before they died are completely different from the ones I practise now!\u201dWith curiosity in mind, Lu Sheng decided to practise the Body Refining Technique from the memories of the two uniform zombies.\u201cThe movements are considerably larger than the Body Refining Technique I practise now, with over\u2026 200 forms!\u201d\u201cSome of the movements appear difficult, but with the memories I inherited from those two zombies, it\u2019s equivalent to having practised it myself countless times, making it easy to perform\u2026\u201d\u201cAs for the effects\u2026\u201dHiss!As soon as Lu Sheng did one of the movements, a certain part of his body produced a tingling sensation similar to an electric shock.The sensation was extremely pleasant as if a wave of warmth was flowing through his body, it felt so good that he nearly let out a moan.[TL/N: Ayo? Sussy baka\u2026][PR/N: I don\u2019t like where this is going\u2026]\u201cThis sensation appeared only once before when I first attempted to perform the 24 Forms of Body Refining\u2026. This is the second time I\u2019ve felt this sensation after all these years!\u201dIt was as if Lu Sheng had discovered a whole new world all of a sudden.He began to focus on practising the Body Refining Technique.At this moment, if a second person was present in the room, they would see Lu Sheng\u2019s body continuously twisting into one weird movement after another.These movements were connected together with an unexpected and wonderfully harmonious sense of grace.And throughout the process, Lu Sheng\u2019s body continued to tremble slightly.His body temperature kept rising, a large volume of white vapours steamed out from the surface of his body, and sweat flowed down his body, nearly drenching the yoga mat underneath him.Whew!Lu Sheng finally performed the last movement.His entire body collapsed on the yoga mat as if it was falling apart.However, he felt like he had never been in better shape, and his whole body had gotten a deep massage from the inside out as if he could actually hear the muscle cells all over his body singing with joy.Grumble, grumble, grumble!An intense sense of hunger passed through Lu Sheng\u2019s brain.\u201cDidn\u2019t I eat dinner just a few hours ago?\u201d[PR/N: Who the duck eats dinner at 6 pm?]Lu Sheng was feeling incredible.The empty stomach constantly reminded him that his body was now in dire need of energy.A lot of energy.And there was only one thing that could cause this\u2026Lu Sheng\u2019s Blood Qi Value, once again, had increased!\u201cUnbelievable!\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s face was filled with amazement.He had performed the Body Refining Technique only once, yet he was able to increase his Blood Qi Value once again.If word of this were to get out, he would probably be immediately treated as a martial arts genius!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There\u2019s also the breathing\u2026\u201d\u201cI subconsciously utilised an amazing Breathing Method while I was practising the Body Refining Technique just now, and the combination of the two resulted in such a terrifying effect\u2026\u201dLu Sheng immediately recalled some images he had seen in the memories of the uniform zombie.[- The Breathing Methods and the Body Refining Techniques, these two things that you\u2019ve been taught, practice them when you eat, when you sleep and even when you go to the toilet!]\u201cBoth the Breathing Method and Body Refining Technique are awesome\u2026\u201dLu Sheng didn\u2019t know what exactly the Breathing Method and Body Refining Technique practised by the uniform zombie before it died was, but he was sure of one thing.These two techniques were much more advanced than the 13th version of the Body Refining Technique that he was currently practising. Which was said to have been jointly created by the masters of the Global Martial Union.Much, much better.\u201cSo this is the real treasure of the dream world\u2026\u201dLu Sheng clenched his fist firmly as his gaze was burning.This was his greatest advantage; no matter how complicated the methods and techniques he obtained in the dream were, with the memories of the person who practised them in their life as a bonus, he would be able to use them without any hurdle in a very fluent manner.This would directly save Lu Sheng a lot of time and energy, a complete shortcut to soaring above heaven.After a brief rest, Lu Sheng walked out of his room, looking for food to replenish his energy.Luckily, there was still a lot of bread, fruits and other food in the refrigerator.Lu Sheng ate and drank a lot, but it barely filled up his stomach.Then he returned to his room and began to practice the mysterious Body Refining Technique, which contained 268 different movements.Lu Sheng performed this Body Refining Technique four times in a row, and the excitement of clearly sensing his own increase in strength made him almost addicted to it.By the end of the practice, Lu Sheng\u2019s body was so exhausted that even lifting his pinky finger became difficult.He even had an illusion.His body resembled a sponge that had been wrung out numerous times, completely drained of all water, collapsing onto the yoga mat in a feeble manner.Sleepiness finally began to sweep into Lu Sheng\u2019s brain.He fell into a deep sleep.Then he woke up in the dream again.Looking at the familiar grey, depressing sky overhead, Lu Sheng, for the first time felt a sense of relief.In the distant wilderness, the zombies wandering around in the grey fog could be vaguely seen.Lu Sheng grinned, his face resembling a lecherous wolf that saw a pretty young girl\u2019s face, fiercely pouncing towards the zombies\u2026\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\u201cLu Sheng, come online later, you\u2019re the only one missing from the 5 blacks.\u201dJust after the school bell rang, Liu Qiming dashed over to talk to Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng shook his head and refused, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cGoing home to catch up on sleep again? Haven\u2019t you stopped having nightmares recently?\u201dLiu Qiming struggled to understand.Lu Sheng lightly said, \u201cNot to catch up on sleep, but to practice and prepare for the college entrance exam.\u201dTch!Liu Qiming had a disdainful expression on his face.\u201cThere\u2019s no one here, why are you still pretending in front of me?\u201dLu Sheng was too lazy to explain it to him.People like Liu Qiming simply wouldn\u2019t understand how enjoyable practising can really be.The pleasure of a rapid increase in strength is simply not something that a computer game can provide.\u201cForget it, do as you like.\u201dLiu Qiming saw Lu Sheng\u2019s unwavering attitude and stopped persuading.\u201cYou will only be enthusiastic for three minutes anyway\u2026\u201dWith his understanding of Lu Sheng, within only a few days, this enthusiasm of Lu Sheng will be gone.When that time comes, the two of them will again be the two musketeers fighting in the Internet Cafe.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\u2018It\u2019s about time to go to the Martial Arts Hall and do another test\u2026\u2019On the way home, Lu Sheng walked while silently thinking in his head.A week had passed since he last went to the Martial Arts Hall for the test.During these seven days, Lu Sheng immersed himself in practice every day, as if he was intoxicated.As soon as he got home from school, he went into his room to do the Body Refining Technique several times, ate dinner and did it a few more times, then went to bed at 10 o\u2019clock exactly, hunted zombies and absorbed their memories in his dreams.If not for the fact that he didn\u2019t have a good explanation to give to the school and his parents, he would have even liked to just skip school and practice at home everyday.\u201cI\u2019ll rent the testing devices\u201dAgain, at the Hongchuan Martial Arts Hall from last time, Lu Sheng arrived at the testing room in a familiar manner.First, he extracted his blood and tested his Blood Qi Value.Lu Sheng watched as the blue light of the testing device slowly scanned his blood.He was incomparably looking forward to the results of his current test.After a week of hard practice, what kind of heights did he reach under the combined practice of the mysterious Body Refining Technique and Breathing Method.Beep![Blood Qi Value: 1.324]\u201c!\u201dLu Sheng clenched his fist firmly, and his eyes were filled with a gleam of astonishment.An unexpected result beyond reason.Compared to the last test, his Blood Qi Value once again increased by a whole 0.36, nearly 0.4.Other people get high on pills everyday, but still can\u2019t increase as fast as he did![TL/N: Do drugs kids.][PR/N: If they are taking pills everyday, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they were really high.]\u201cLet\u2019s measure the Combat Power Index now!\u201dLu Sheng walked over to the combat power measuring device, took a deep breath, clenched his fist and\u2026Boom!Compared to the last test, the speed at which Lu Sheng threw his punch now was much faster and his movements were more precise and smooth.This was also due to the large number of combat skills he had absorbed during this period of time, of which there were many techniques related to unarmed combat.The way Lu Sheng was now throwing his punches was no less than some veteran fighters who have been fighting for more than 2 decades.Beep!With a sound, a number popped on the combat power measuring device.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This situation is only possible for those geniuses who also practice practical combat martial arts. But now I, too, can be considered a genius\u2026\u201dLu Sheng smiled, imagining what kind of surprised face his teachers and classmates would have if his current strength was exposed.\u201cYou have been using our Hongchuan Martial Arts Hall\u2019s secret medicinal bath to assist your cultivation for so long. Your Blood Qi Value should have grown considerably; it\u2019s time to test it\u2026\u201dThe sound of footsteps and talking came from the entrance.Lu Sheng\u2019s ears twitched as he quickly erased the data on the tester and walked towards the door.When he was almost at the door, Lu Sheng saw a beautiful woman with smooth skin and a tall figure leading a teenager about the same age as him, approaching in his direction as they brushed past him.\u201cIt\u2019s a student who came to rent the testing devices\u2026 I guess he\u2019s from a nearby school\u2026\u201dNi Shuang glanced at Lu Sheng, who walked out the door and casually said to the teenager beside her.\u201cThis type of student, whose family can\u2019t even afford a tester, probably didn\u2019t do too well\u2026\u201dThe teenager behind Ni Shuang spoke with a smirk.The teenager had fair skin, looked slightly handsome, dressed rather more refined than people from ordinary families, and spoke with a natural sense of superiority.\u201cPerhaps.\u201dNi Shuang nodded her head.Although the tone of the teenager\u2019s speech made her slightly uncomfortable, there was no denying that what he said wasn\u2019t wrong.As the saying goes, \u201cpoor in academics, but strong in martial arts\u201d.In martial arts practice, resources also play a big part in the overall process.The children from wealthy families grow up taking all kinds of pills even before they start to develop, their Blood Qi Value far exceeds that of others by a wide margin, and later there remains room to practice all kinds of martial arts techniques, widening the gap between them and their peers.Whereas the children of poor families may not even get to eat properly, and occasionally taking a single pill will cost the family\u2019s entire savings, how could they ever compete with the children of those wealthy families?Just like the kid who had just walked out, he was very skinny and malnourished over a long time.\u201cLet\u2019s begin with the test.\u201dNi Shuang refocused her mind and instructed the teenager to begin with the test.The test results came out shortly.\u201cBlood Qi Value 1.253, Combat Power Index 130!\u201dThe teenager was pleased and said, \u201cBlood Qi Value has increased by a whole 0.03 from half a month ago. Senior sister Ni, this medicinal bath is far more effective than the pills I usually take.\u201dNi Shuang\u2019s face also revealed a smile as she explained, \u201cYou usually take too many pills. Naturally, some residual medicinal energy will be accumulated in your body. Our Ni family\u2019s medicinal bath is to stimulate these medicinal energies within your body.The effect for the first month will indeed be remarkable. Afterwards, it will gradually decrease, so you must continue taking various pills to assist.\u201d\u201cPills? My family has plenty of them. More importantly, they are effective\u2026\u201dThe teenager waved his hand indifferently, the increase in Blood Qi Value made him very excited, suddenly his eyes turned as if he thought of something, and he quickly walked to the device that Lu Sheng had just used, saying to Ni Shuang, \u201cSenior sister Ni, can you bring up the test results of that guy just now, I would like to see how wide the gap is between men and others\u2026\u201d\u201cThe ones you should be comparing yourself to now are those geniuses in your school, the top students, not ordinary people\u2026\u201d\u201cI know I know, I just want to boost my self-confidence a little, Senior Sister Ni, please\u2026\u201dUnable to resist the teenager\u2019s pleading, Ni Shuang reluctantly walked over to the device and brought up the previous tester\u2019s results.\u201cThat guy was as skinny as a bamboo stick, his Blood Qi Value is probably not even 1. He\u2019s probably also a little older than me\u2026 hehe\u2026\u201dThe teenager\u2019s mouth was chattering, and his face was already beginning to reveal a sense of pleasure after his sense of vanity was satisfied.But when the data was displayed in front of him, the teenager\u2019s expression froze.His entire body was frozen in place, his eyes staring straight at the data on the display as if he couldn\u2019t believe his own eyes.[Blood Qi Value 1.324, Combat Power Index 168!]\u201cIt\u2019s false!\u201dThe teenager yelled up immediately, shouting in disbelief, \u201cThat guy\u2026 that guy just now\u2026 how can his Blood Qi Value be so much higher than mine?!\u201dNi Shuang was also frozen for a moment.A Blood Qi Value of 1.32, in Beihai City, regardless of which high school it is, will be considered an upper-level score.But what was even more exaggerated was the Combat Power Index of 168, which exceeded the standard of Blood Qi Value by more than 30, demonstrating that the other party had obviously attained a considerable level of attainment in practical combat as well.\u2018When my Blood Qi Value was 1.3, even my Combat Power wasn\u2019t this exceptional.\u2019The young man who was considered \u201cpoor\u201d and \u201cmalnourished\u201d by him, turned out to be an undeniable genius.\u201cSister Ni, could you have pulled up the wrong data?

I am now able to do the whole set of movements perfectly\u2026\u201dThe results will naturally vary even if different people practice the same Body Refining Technique.For example, someone might be better at the first 30 movements, while someone else might be better at the last 30 movements.Different movements correspond to different muscle group exercises, resulting in the difference in each individual\u2019s physical qualities.And Lu Sheng absorbed the memories of so many uniform zombies, almost integrating the parts that everyone was good at,, so much so that he has now attained a very high level of proficiency in the set of Body Refining Technique and the accompanying Breathing Method.\u201cThe effects are still amazing. I can almost feel my previously unexercised muscle groups being developed every day.\u201d\u201cIf the level of human body\u2019s development with this set of Body Refining Technique is at 100%, then the level of human body\u2019s development with the 24 Forms of Body Refining implemented by the Global Martial Union may not even be 1%\u2026\u201d\u201cThe difference between these two Body Refining Techniques is simply too great\u2026\u201dLu Sheng couldn\u2019t help but sigh.After practice, Lu Sheng got up and simply used a towel to wipe off his body.A familiar knocking sound came from outside the door just after he changed into some dry clothes.\u201cLu Sheng, come out to eat.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dLu Sheng replied back and quickly cleaned up before walking out of his room.The family was already waiting for him at the dinner table.There were around seven or eight plates of dishes on the table, most of which were meat dishes.A basin full of white rice was placed in front of the seat belonging to Lu Sheng.That\u2019s right, a basin.Because the family could no longer find a container larger than a basin.\u201cXiao[1] Sheng, come and eat.\u201d[1. Xiao = Little. (An affectionate way of calling someone)]Mother Zheng Yufen asked Lu Sheng to sit down.Lu Sheng nodded, sat down, and began to bury his face in rice.Over the past week, Lu Sheng\u2019s meal size had progressively gotten larger and larger.Initially, it was only twice the size of his sister Lu Qinghe, but now, it\u2019s nearly five times the size that Lu Qinghe eats.With two large eaters at home, mother Zheng Yufen\u2019s everyday task: cooking, had become a major job.\u201cReally can eat\u2026\u201dLu Qinghe looked at the way Lu Sheng buried his face in rice and muttered out, then she also stuffed a few mouthfuls of rice into her own mouth, not willing to be outdone by him.Lu Dahai joyously watched the pair of kids eating, his mood was very pleasant.\u201cEat all you want, there\u2019s more than enough rice.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Xiao Sheng recently, he eats so much, but is still getting thinner and thinner\u2026\u201dZheng Yufen pinched Lu Sheng\u2019s sharply defined arm and said with some concern.\u201cWhat do you know\u2026 boys are like this during their development period.\u201dLu Dahai added a piece of pork ribs to Lu Sheng\u2019s rice bowl and asked with a smile, \u201cHave you measured your Blood Qi Value recently, did it increase?\u201dLu Sheng didn\u2019t even raise his head and said in a muffled voice, \u201cYes, it has increased a little.\u201dLu Dahai\u2019s eyes lit up, and he couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cHow much did it increase by?\u201d\u201cAlmost\u2026 almost exceeded 1, I think.\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s mouth was stuffed with rice as he replied in a vague manner.He didn\u2019t dare to tell the truth for fear of scaring his parents, nor could he explain.\u201cAlmost exceeded 1? Good, good\u2026\u201dEven if he had withheld most of his progress, this result still made Lu Dahai extremely surprised.\u201cTomorrow, I\u2019ll go out and buy some pills for you\u2026 Blood Qi growth isn\u2019t something that can be replenished by just eating\u2026\u201dLu Sheng lifted his head, and his eyes lingered on the plaster patch that showed a corner of his dad, Lu Dahai\u2019s, shoulder for a while, but he didn\u2019t speak.Lu Dahai was only an ordinary worker, and his mother\u2019s salary at the supermarket wasn\u2019t high either.With a family like this, it was already a struggle to afford the everyday martial arts practice for the two kids.Buying additional pills would only make the burden on his parents even heavier.From his parents\u2019 usual conversation, Lu Sheng learned that Lu Dahai was already actively looking for extra jobs to do after work these days, while his mother was also working other part-time jobs.\u2018I have to! I have to find a way to make money!\u2019Lu Sheng secretly made up his mind within his heart.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014Two figures were exchanging blows in the grey mist-covered wilderness.Lu Sheng\u2019s opponent was a zombie dressed in a blue uniform.This type of zombie was much stronger than the ones he had encountered at first, the ones wearing grey uniforms.They had greater strength, greater speed, and they had even retained some of their combat skills.The one before him was one of them.The blue uniform zombie roared and extended its big arm to fiercely grasp Lu Sheng.The arm made a \u201cwhirring\u201d sound in the air as it approached Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes remained unchanged, taking several fierce steps forward, using his shoulder against the blue uniform zombie\u2019s big arm, he deflected the punch.Then he quickly reached out and wrapped his arm around its neck in an obscure position.With a fierce downwards pull\u2026His knee blasted out like a cannonball, brutally hitting the zombie\u2019s jaw.Crack!The blue uniform zombie\u2019s head turned at a weird angle, drooping behind its shoulders.After staggering for a bit, it fell to the ground.The zombie quickly weathered, and a black line of smoke emerged, rapidly scurrying into Lu Sheng\u2019s body.\u201cSquad leader\u2026 good at fist techniques\u2026\u201dLu Sheng opened his eyes, indicating that the memories had already been absorbed.The blue uniform \u201celite monster\u201d brought Lu Sheng a considerable harvest.After absorbing the memories, Lu Sheng felt that his comprehension of the fist techniques had reached a new level.It seemed to have vaguely hit a bottleneck.And above it was a whole new world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If I keep going, eventually I\u2019ll be able to reach Base 1359\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd it shouldn\u2019t be too long before that day arrives.\u201dThe area ahead of Lu Sheng was shrouded in gray fog, with a few stumbling figures emerging from it occasionally.He strode ahead with a firm gaze.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014[In the Classroom]\u201cAbout the answer to this question\u2026\u201dLu Sheng was intently listening to the teacher\u2019s lecture.After his cultivation reached the 1st Level, Lu Sheng observed that his brain had also become more flexible.According to Lu Sheng\u2019s theory, it should be due to the fact that he absorbed a great number of memories from the dream world, and the process of accumulating these memories stimulated his brain\u2019s development, improving his memory, brain functioning speed, and other aspects.To put it in layman\u2019s terms, he became smarter.To put it in a fantasy term, he attained enlightenment.In any case, learning textbook knowledge now felt extraordinarily simple for Lu Sheng.Previously, he failed to even comprehend the knowledge, but now after reading it once, he was able to directly reach the level of a \u201cHonors Student\u201d.Literature knowledge wasn\u2019t entirely useless to Lu Sheng.After all, the purpose of the college entrance exam is to test literature as well, it\u2019s just that they don\u2019t contribute that much in the overall score.\u201cAll right, class dismissed!\u201dAs the bell rang, the math teacher ended his lecture and announced the end of class, reminding in passing, \u201cThe next session is a practical class; students should remember to gather early in the practical classroom.\u201dAfter giving the reminder, the math teacher walked out with the textbooks and a tea cup.[PR/N: He walked out with what?!]Lu Sheng sorted his notes and books before packing them and left the classroom.The practical combat class is normally held in the school\u2019s Martial Arts Hall, which is a few minutes away from the main school building. In order to not be late for class, they must leave immediately; this is also why the math teacher didn\u2019t dare to delay his lectures.\u201cHey, Lu Sheng!\u201dRight after walking out of the classroom, Lu Sheng heard someone calling his name from behind.Liu Qiming dashed over to him and subconsciously tried to wrap his arm around Lu Sheng\u2019s shoulder.But his hand only reached halfway before inexplicably retreating.\u201cWait\u2026 wait for me, let\u2019s go together.\u201dLiu Qiming had no idea what just happened to him.Previously, he and Lu Sheng frequently played and joked around with each other, and this kind of little friendly physical contact was nothing.But today, when he approached Lu Sheng, he felt an inexplicable sense of timidness.It was as if\u2026An invisible aura existed around Lu Sheng\u2019s body, repelling him strongly.\u201cYou have\u2026 really changed a lot recently.\u201dLiu Qiming tried to walk beside Lu Sheng, but his voice was unconsciously tinged with some caution.\u201cIs that so?\u201dLu Sheng didn\u2019t notice Liu Qiming\u2019s abnormality, and casually replied, \u201cAfter all, the college entrance examination is coming up, and you know my family\u2019s situation, if I don\u2019t work hard, I\u2019ll be a complete burden to them\u2026\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 our family conditions are similar, I also need to start working hard.\u201dLiu Qiming purposefully walked one step behind Lu Sheng, at his side, and immediately felt a lot more relaxed.His speech became considerably smoother as he no longer had to directly face the oppressive aura emanating from Lu Sheng\u2019s body.\u201cBut my situation is a little better than yours since I am the only son\u2026\u201dLu Sheng slightly nodded.Liu Qiming was correct. If Lu Sheng was the only child or it was only his sister, the burden on his parents would certainly be much less.\u201cBut your sister is so talented, she\u2019ll be guaranteed a spot in Wuhan University in the future, with a full scholarship and all kinds of other subsidies, without any problem\u2026\u201d\u201cThe locker room is here, I\u2019ll get the door for you\u2026\u201dLiu Qiming rushed past Lu Sheng and opened the locker room door for him in advance.The two who were supposed to be sworn friends, but suddenly one seemed to be reduced to a mere follower of the other, while Liu Qiming didn\u2019t even realize, as if everything was natural and as it should be.[PR/N: Protagonist Halo in effect.]\u201cScholarship\u2026\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s eyes lit up with a thought.Liu Qiming\u2019s words gave him inspiration.He had been thinking about how to earn money recently.On one hand, it was to reduce the burden on his family so that his parents wouldn\u2019t have to work so hard.On the other hand, as his martial arts training continued to progress, he would need a lot of money to support it.A simple example would be food.Now Lu Sheng eats regular meals, and it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult for him to maintain the nutrients required for the increase in his Blood Qi Value.If this continued, it\u2019d definitely slow down his progress, and he\u2019d turn into a nasty manure-making machine.Lu Sheng had previously thought of a way to earn money; to officially become a Level 1 Martial Artist, and receive a monthly subsidy of several thousand from the Global Martial Union, which he could then use to buy resources for repleshing his Blood Qi.Now, Liu Qiming\u2019s words made him think of another way \u2013 scholarship.Every school would give monetary rewards to students with good academic performance, and Beihai No.3 Middle School was no exception.Lu Sheng immediately came up with an idea.\u201cI remember the first-class scholarship in the Beihai No.3 Middle School was around 10,000 yuan. If I could get this money\u2026\u201dIn order to win this scholarship, he\u2019d certainly have to reveal some of the talent and strength that a first-class scholarship winner should have.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Shit!\u201dLu Sheng suddenly heard a sour complaint from Liu Qiming next to him.Only then did he notice the boy that was called up by Zhong Zhengguo to be his sparring partner.The boy\u2019s name was Yang Yifei, his family was well-off, his martial arts performance was first in his grade, plus his handsome appearance, he had certain popularity even in the school.Now, dressed in a white martial arts uniform, with Zhong Zhengguo watching over Yang Yifei\u2019s moves, it attracted the direct peachy gaze of all the girls.\u201cEven if you are given the chance, you wouldn\u2019t be able to resist Teacher Zhong\u2019s fist, even if he held back.\u201dLu Sheng glanced at Liu Qiming and said indifferently.Liu Qiming\u2019s face flushed as he grumbled, \u201cWho allowed Yang Yifei\u2019s family to consume all types of pills for dinner? I heard his Blood Qi Value is nearly 1.2\u2026\u201dLiu Qiming seemed unconvinced, thinking if he and Yang Yifei were practising in the same environment and he could perform better than Yang Yifei.Lu Sheng didn\u2019t speak to him again, instead calmly watched Zhong Zhengguo and Yang Yifei\u2019s demonstration.On the surface, Lu Sheng appeared to be attentive, but he was in fact thinking about the scholarship.When and how to approach the teacher with the matter\u2026\u201cAlright, the demonstration is almost over; next, two students come up for practical combat, I will face them alone.\u201dZhong Zhenguo ended the demonstration and casually said to Yang Yifei beside him, \u201cYang Yifei, don\u2019t go down yet, find another person to practice with.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dYang Yifei appeared normal as if he had grown accustomed to such special treatment.\u201cIs there any student who wants to challenge Yang Yifei to a fight?\u201dZhong Zhengguo asked loudly, and wherever his gaze swept over, the students underneath dodged.\u201cNo one?\u201dZhong Zhengguo frowned slightly, somewhat disappointed.Every time he mentioned practical combat practice, these students cowered like ostriches, trying to bury their heads in the dirt, making it impossible for him to instruct them.Many people secretly claim that he favours the top students in the class.But they don\u2019t think about how, every time there\u2019s such a situation, except for the top students like Yang Yifei, how many of them step forward to accept his instructions?Many of them complain about a lack of opportunities, but they fail to recognize that; with their repeated retreat the opportunities gradually slip away.Zhong Zhengguo swept his gaze over each student, growing increasingly disappointed in his heart.Just as he was about to call up a random student, he suddenly met a pair of deep, dark eyes.\u201cHmm?!\u201dZhong Zhengguo\u2019s eyes widened as his gaze landed on a student with calm eyes and a thin body.Among a crowd that avoided his gaze, someone who dared to look him directly in the eyes appeared very notable and startling.\u201cAlright, you, that student. You come up and spar with Yang Yifei\u2026\u201dZhong Zhengguo said loudly as he pointed at the distinctive student.\u201cLu Sheng, Teacher Zhong is calling you\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh?!\u201dLu Sheng came back from his thoughts just to discover that he had been chosen by Zhong Zhenguo to go up and spar with Yang Yifei.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And it wasn\u2019t like he had never been picked before.Then, he stood up and walked toward the middle of the field.When Lu Sheng stood up, Zhong Zhenguo was stunned.At that moment, he had an illusion, as if he was looking at a fierce tiger slowly getting up from its slumber.The natural temperament that exuded from Lu Sheng\u2019s body made Zhong Zhenguo almost think that what he was looking at wasn\u2019t just an average student, but a warrior who had experienced countless battles striding towards him.\u201cTeacher.\u201dLu Sheng walked over to Zhong Zhenguo and calmly greeted him.Zhong Zhengguo noticed the strong, smooth and well-defined muscle full of strength revealed under Lu Sheng\u2019s visibly short sleeves, and couldn\u2019t help but light up.\u2018How come I didn\u2019t notice that there was such a good seedling in the class before?!\u2019Zhong Zhenguo looked up and down at Lu Sheng with a slightly pleased look and asked, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\u201cLu Sheng.\u201d\u201cWhat was your score on the last Blood Qi Value test?\u201dLu Sheng thought for a moment and replied truthfully, \u201c0.802.\u201d\u2018Only 0.8? It\u2019s a bit on the low side, it doesn\u2019t look like it.\u2019Zhong Zhenguo frowned.\u2018Could it be that I have misjudged?\u2019Zhong Zhenguo shook his head, but didn\u2019t continue to think too deeply, then arranged, \u201cSpar with Yang Yifei, use the martial arts techniques I just taught, and after the end, I will point out any shortcomings in your movements.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dLu Sheng nodded, then walked over to Yang Yifei and stood still.Yang Yifei\u2019s expression was relaxed, he nodded slightly at Lu Sheng, and reminded him, \u201cMy Blood Qi Value is 1.22 already, so I might strike a little too hard later, you should be careful.\u201dLu Sheng didn\u2019t react, only casually nodded.However, the students at the bottom all exclaimed in a lowly voice.\u201cDammit! Yang Yifei\u2019s Blood Qi Value is 1.22, I haven\u2019t even reached 0.9!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s too strong, I\u2019m afraid he can be ranked in the top ten in his grade.\u201d\u201cAs expected of Yang Yifei.\u201dYang Yifei heard these admiring voices, he obviously felt a bit flattered, and with a faint, confident and calm smile on his face, he said to Lu Sheng, \u201cAre you ready? Let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLu Sheng nodded.\u201cHere I come.\u201dYang Yifei shouted, and his entire body sprang forward like a cheetah, dashing towards Lu Sheng.Even Zhong Zhenguo, who was watching from the sidelines, couldn\u2019t help but nod his head slightly when he saw his performance.As for the students at the bottom, they were already well prepared to be amazed.One by one, in the eyes of all the girls, sparkles began to appear.Liu Qiming turned his head slightly and looked at Lu Sheng with a worried expression.Then, in the next moment\u2026Boom!A figure flew out from the middle of the field, flying out five to six meters away, before falling hard on the ground.\u201cYang Yifei you\u2019re so handsome! Yang Yifei\u2026\u201dThe admiring voice of a girl rang out just in time, making it exceptionally abrupt.The girl shouted only halfway, only to notice suddenly that something was wrong.Everyone around was silent, staring fixedly at the middle of the field with an expression she couldn\u2019t comprehend.The girl looked back carefully, and her entire body was instantly frozen.Only to see at the edge of the field, the pale figure holding his chest was the male god she worshipped in her mind- Yang Yifei.As for Lu Sheng, he was standing in the middle of the field with dignity, and it appeared as if he didn\u2019t even take one step.Silence!The field became eerily quiet.Everyone looked at Lu Sheng in a daze, and Yang Yifei, who fell to the ground from pain, couldn\u2019t believe his eyes.\u201cLu\u2026 Lu Sheng, with a single move, sent Yang Yifei, a genius with a Blood Qi Value of 1.2 who was ranked in the top ten of his grade, flying out?\u201dThey doubted whether they were dreaming.Even Zhong Zhenguo was stunned.Then he quickly realized one thing.He indeed didn\u2019t misjudge.\u201cHurry and get two people to help Yang Yifei go to the infirmary.\u201dZhong Zhengguo quickly gave orders, and only then did the others wake up as if they were dreaming and took action.Then he looked at Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes again, as if he was looking at a monster.\u201cTeacher Zhong, I just\u2026\u201dLu Sheng wanted to explain to Zhong Zhengguo that it wasn\u2019t his intention to not use the fighting techniques he taught.Instead, when Yang Yifei was rushing over, his fighting instinct drove him to do so subconsciously.By the time he reacted and wanted to cooperate with the sparring, Yang Yifei was already sent flying.Who knew he was so incapable of fighting\u2026\u201cStop, you come with me for a moment.\u201dZhong Zhengguo waved his big hand, ordered Lu Sheng and breezed out the door, not caring whether the practical class was over or not.Lu Sheng could only obediently follow.Only after the two left did a loud chatter explode in the field.\u201cHoly shit!

Did that look like 0.8 to you?\u201dZhong Zhengguo brought Lu Sheng into the office and stared at him with scorching eyes.\u201cTeacher Zhong, you asked about the result of the last test so\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng replied, feeling somewhat helpless.Zhong Zhengguo was speechless for a minute before saying, \u201cI will test you again right now.\u201dLu Sheng gave a nod.A few moments later, the test results came out.Zhong Zhengguo sat on his buttocks in the chair and gave Lu Sheng a complicated look that would be difficult to put into words.It was a combination of shock with delight, delight with surprise and surprise with doubt\u2026Doubts about him, doubts about the truth.That kind of complicated look.\u201cWhen was the last time you tested?\u201dZhong Zhengguo took a deep breath trying to calm himself down before opening his mouth to ask Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng thought about it and replied, \u201cThe last monthly test, about less than a month.\u201d\u2018If I count the private test, it would be a week ago.\u2019\u201cLess than a month ago\u2026\u201dZhong Zhengguo was at a loss for words.He took another look at the test results.[Blood Qi Value: 1.532][Combat Power Index: 192]Two jaw-dropping numbers.It already exceeded the standard values for a level 1 martial artist.Although the school\u2019s testing devices were supposedly not as exact as the Global Martial Union\u2019s, the up and down fluctuation wouldn\u2019t be that great, and the true score would be accurate to 8 or 9.In other words.The student in front of him, named Lu Sheng, could already be considered an official Level 1 Martial Artist.He was just under eighteen years old this year, and there were still more than two hundred days before the college entrance exam.At Beihai No.3 Middle School, the practical combat class he, Zhong Zhengguo, led actually had an official, less than eighteen-year-old Level 1 Martial Artist.Zhong Zhengguo was still digesting this outcome.Although a less than eighteen-year-old level 1 martial artist in the Dragon Kingdom, or Beihai City, isn\u2019t particularly impressive.However, in their Beihai No.3 Middle School, is an absolutely uncompromised top genius, as the sole seedling.At least for now, there isn\u2019t a single student in Beihai No.3 Middle School who has reached this height or even come close.Moreover, Zhong Zhengguo saw more than just that.What he valued most was the Combat Power Index of the student in front of him, named Lu Sheng, as well as his performance in the practical combat class.Combat Power Index 192, exceeding the standard of Blood Qi Value by more than an entire 40!One should be aware that before becoming an official level 1 \u2013 no, level 3 martial artist\u2026The Combat Power Index of a martial artist closely follows the Blood Qi Value.Because Blood Qi represents speed and strength.Naturally, the amount of destructive power one has is proportional to their Blood Qi Value.The transformation from a level 3 to level 4 martial artist is a crucial stage, and many would stay at this level to refine their muscles and bones.At that time, the role of martial arts techniques really begins to manifest, and the martial artist\u2019s Combat Power Index will grow by leaps and bounds.Prior to that, techniques may create various gaps in practical combat, but the increase in combat power will be small.For example, Zhong Zhenguo, a level 2 martial artist\u2026Has a Blood Qi Value of 15, while Combat Power Index is just over 1500, barely a few dozen points higher than the standard Blood Qi ValueIn retrospect, Lu Sheng, who had a Combat Power Index that was more than 40 points higher than the Blood Qi Value standard for a level 1 martial artist\u2026Was simply a monster!During the practical combat class, the move Lu Sheng used to send Yang Yifei flying, others may not have seen, but he saw it clearly.The skills that Lu Sheng displayed in that punch, made even him a bit awed.\u2018He is undoubtedly a combat-type martial arts genius!\u2019At this moment, Zhong Zhenguo had an incomparably strong sense of premonition in his heart.The Beihai No.3 Middle School, this time\u2026May really have discovered a treasure!Lu Sheng stood there silently watching Zhong Zhengguo\u2019s eyes flickering rapidly, presumably thinking about something on the spot.After the slight tension in the beginning, Lu Sheng now was completely calm.Although revealing his strength this time caught him off guard, thinking about it again.This was also a good opportunity.It was the perfect opportunity to apply for a scholarship to the school, and with his current strength, it wouldn\u2019t make sense if he didn\u2019t pass.This test also gave Lu Sheng a whole new perspective on his own strength; he had almost met the standard evaluation of a level 1 martial artist, and it was time to take the official examination for a level 1 martial artist.The current Lu Sheng was really too short on money.By this time, Zhong Zhengguo had also pretty much sorted out his mood.\u201cWith your current scores, you can apply to join the school\u2019s top class\u2026\u201dZhong Zhengguo also didn\u2019t inquire further as to why Lu Sheng\u2019s Blood Qi Value had nearly doubled in less than a month.There could be only a few reasons.He had previously concealed his strength.Or, his body suddenly entered a period of rapid development, and the previously latent talent gradually began to develop.These two situations had happened with other students as well, therefore there was no need to investigate further.If pursued too hard, the student might start to resent him.\u201cTeacher, I think it is fine to remain in the current class; there is no need to change classes,\u201d Lu Sheng replied.Zhong Zhengguo nodded with a complicated expression.He, too, felt that there was no need.Cultivation of Blood Qi Value relied entirely on the students themselves, and what the teachers could teach were simply some practical combat techniques.And, in that regard, Lu Sheng had even surpassed many teachers.\u201cThen, if you have any requests for which you believe the school can help you and provide any facilities, you can ask them now.\u201dZhong Zhengguo inquired.Lu Sheng had been waiting for this exact opportunity.\u201cI\u2019d like to apply for the school\u2019s martial arts scholarship, and\u2026 I\u2019d like to have more free time away from school.\u201dLu Sheng mentioned the two things in his mind together, the second of which came to him on the spur of the moment.Lu Sheng had always felt that staying in school for the current him was a waste of time; if he had more time every day to practice the Body Refining Technique and explore the dream world, his strength might be able to increase even faster.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019m thankful to the school as well.\u201dLu Sheng expressed his gratitude, and after a little thought, he added, \u201cTeacher Zhong, one more thing. I hope that my family won\u2019t find out about my current grades and the treatment I\u2019ve received from the school just yet.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dZhong Zhenguo nodded.Lu Sheng\u2019s sudden increase in strength, martial artists may understand, but it\u2019ll be difficult to explain to ordinary families.If Lu Sheng\u2019s parents found out and questioned him about it, then did something that may affect Lu Sheng\u2019s martial arts progress. It\u2019d be something that no one would like to see.\u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019ll leave first, teacher Zhong.\u201d\u201cYes, you can go.\u201dZhong Zhenguo waved his hand and watched as Lu Sheng left the office.A few moments after Lu Sheng left, Zhong Zhenguo, who was sitting in a chair, suddenly stood up.The calm on his face vanished, replaced with an intense rush of excitement and triumph.\u201cLu Sheng, my Baihe No.3 Middle School has actually produced someone like Lu Sheng!\u201d\u201cAn official level 1 martial artist who is less than eighteen-years-old, with a combat power of close to 200!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll keep Lu Sheng as a secret weapon before the college entrance exam. After the college entrance exam, I will taunt those from the No.1 and No. 2 High Schools. Haha, I\u2019m getting excited just thinking about those guys\u2019 expressions\u2026\u201d\u201cThe principal must be notified of this news immediately.\u201dZhong Zhenguo walked out of the office with a bright face.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014When Lu Sheng returned, the practical combat class had already ended, and all the students had already returned to their classrooms.As Lu Sheng entered, the initially noisy classroom instantly turned silent.Then everyone\u2019s gaze focused on him.Shock, amazement, intrigued, admiration, fear\u2026Lu Sheng walked to his seat as usual.The moment after he sat down, the quiet classroom slowly became noisy once again.Similar to when a tiger enters a flock, the entire flock becomes silent.Then when the tiger goes to rest, the frightened sheep resume their hustle and bustle.Lu Sheng was the tiger.Soon after Lu Sheng took his seat, he noticed the pale Yang Yifei, limping in with someone\u2019s help.Yang Yifei also saw Lu Sheng and his eyes were filled with anger and resentment.But when he met Lu Sheng\u2019s gaze, he immediately dodged to the side.Lu Sheng\u2019s punch in the practical combat class had clearly frightened him.Nearby, Liu Qiming wanted to come up and talk to Lu Sheng several times.But he couldn\u2019t dare to open his mouth even after trying a few times.Liu Qiming looked at Lu Sheng, who was seated in the seat, calmly flipping through a book, and for a moment seemed somewhat lost.He suddenly realised that his long-time best friend had become very unfamiliar\u2026 and distant.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014[Beihai City, City Centre Mall]In a shop named \u201cMartial Medicine Hall\u201d, a tall teenager in a school uniform was looking at the products on the counter.The shop assistant lady walked up to the teenager and asked politely, \u201cSir, what type of pill are you looking to buy?\u201dThe teenager looked up, revealing a handsome and delicate face, and shook his head.\u201cThank you but I\u2019m just looking around.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThe shop assistant lady sensibly stepped away.The teenager in front of her, dressed as a student, was obviously not her potential customer target.This teenager was none other than Lu Sheng, who came to hang out after school.A scholarship was on its way, and Lu Sheng couldn\u2019t wait to go to the mall and decide how to spend the money.It wasn\u2019t that he couldn\u2019t restrain himself, planning to spend the money before he even received it, instead he just really wanted to improve his strength quickly.In the past few days, Lu Sheng noticed that his body was constantly sending out a strong \u201chunger sensation\u201d, due to the continuous progress with the Body Refining Technique and the Breathing Method.This was a symptom of rapid Blood Qi growth and a deficiency in the bodyEvery muscle cell in his body was starving for energy nourishments.Although his father, Lu Dahai, bought him a pill to take last week, it was a drop in the bucket that gave him little relief.If such a state of \u201cmalnutrition\u201d continues for an extended period of time, the body may suffer permanent and irreversible damage, and his strength may even revert.Because martial arts practice, in fact, is a continuous process of developing the potential of the human body.The increase of a martial artist\u2019s Blood Qi Value would be the embodiment of the human body\u2019s potential being continuously stimulated.However, the potential can also decrease, and if not replenished in a timely manner, it will cause harm.The way to replenish would be to take in a large amount of external energy.Through food, pills, etc.However, food can only provide a tiny amount of energy, whereas medicinal materials rich in nutrients required by the human body make up the majority.But these precious pills were quite valuable.Hence, the phrase, \u201cpoor in academics, but in strong martial arts\u201d, is not something that can be said easily.\u201cThere are two main types of pills on the market, external and internal.\u201d\u201cExternal type is divided into medicinal baths, coating, acupuncture, patches and so on.\u201d\u201cExternal pills are milder, absorbed faster and much easier than internal pills. However, the process is time-consuming and the conditions are harsher, the replenishing effect also worsens with each time, and the dosage has to be increased frequently.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go with the internal type pills.\u201dLu Sheng had been focused on looking for internal type pills.However, the price of internal type pills made him frown.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If it wasn\u2019t for me as her mediocre brother; with her martial arts talent, she would have achieved far greater results than now\u2026\u201dLu Dahai was currently providing him and Lu Qinghe with two pairs of Blood-Nourishing Pills every month. (The Lu family\u2019s limit)If all four Blood-Nourishing Pills were given to Lu Qinghe, the result would be obvious.Thinking of this, Lu Sheng\u2019s desire to make money became stronger.\u201cWhether it\u2019s for my own or for Lu Qinghe\u2019s martial arts journey, I must work harder\u2026\u201dLu Sheng didn\u2019t continue to browse any further and walked out of the mall.The central shopping mall was quite far from the neighbourhood where Lu Sheng\u2019s family lived, but Lu Sheng chose to walk home instead of taking the bus.The process of walking home like this was a good way for Lu Sheng to relax from his high-intensity daily practice.\u201cLet\u2019s go for gold today! I\u2019ve recently learned a new sword skill, so I\u2019ll carry you to slaughter!\u201d\u201cReally\u2026? Come on man, like hell I believe you\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh? You dare underestimate my sword art?! Just wait, it seems like I need to showcase some of my newfound strength to you\u2026\u201dSeveral high-school students in school uniforms and carrying backpacks rushed past Lu Sheng in groups, heading to the nearest net cafe.A tremor went through Lu Sheng\u2019s heart.He was like these students until just a month ago, hanging out after school every day and going to a net cafe.Like a fish living in mud, dazzled by the sights and turbidity in front of him, everyday was muddled, spinning in place, with no direction, and no motivation.Now, he is out of this mud, clear-headed, understands exactly what he wants, and knows exactly what lies ahead.\u201cDo I have any regrets?\u201dLu Sheng asked himself softly.\u201cNo, I have none.\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s eyes were calm and he answered firmly.He sacrificed some of his happiness, but he was undoubtedly more fulfilled and satisfied now.At that moment, several memories of fist techniques suddenly raced through Lu Sheng\u2019s mind.A large number of fragmented images rapidly flashed past his eyes.In that instant, he seemed to have grasped something.Something appeared to be broken.Lu Sheng\u2019s mind became incomparably clear, and something entirely new appeared in his mind.\u201cA breakthrough\u2026\u201dLu Sheng looked at his hands, slightly disoriented.He definitely felt that the bottleneck of fist techniques that he had reached previously by absorbing a large number of memories had been broken through, and his understanding of fist techniques had reached a whole new realm.It was a complex state to describe.Removing the weeds while retaining the essence results in a whole new appearance.The current Lu Sheng felt that he could perfectly master any of the Fist Techniques in his mind.He could use the Fist Techniques to react accordingly in any situation.Mastery.That\u2019s most likely what it meant.\u201cI had previously heard from the teacher in class that those powerful martial arts masters would gain wonderful insights under certain specific circumstances and states of mind, allowing their martial arts to undergo a significant transformation.\u201d\u201cA clear heart and a clear mind.\u201d\u201cIn martial arts, this scenario is known as enlightenment.\u201d\u201cDid I just experience enlightenment?\u201dLu Sheng wasn\u2019t sure.But it didn\u2019t matter.He only knew that his strength should\u2019ve increased once again.If the current him and the past him fought each other, the winner would be determined in a matter of a few moves.This was the gap brought about by the attainment of Mastery in the Fist Techniques.Lu Sheng was tempted to rush to the Hongchuan Martial Arts Hall to take another test, but he quickly restrained himself.The amount of tests taken has no effect on one\u2019s strength capabilities.Strength is one\u2019s own, and it won\u2019t run away just because you didn\u2019t test in time.Besides, it was already quite late today, and if he delayed for any longer, he\u2019d inevitably be questioned by his parents when he returned home.Thinking of this, Lu Sheng quickened his pace.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\u201cI\u2019m going back to my room.\u201dLu Sheng put down the bowls and chopsticks, calmly said goodbye to his family, and returned to his room.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Xiao Sheng today? Is he not feeling well\u2026?\u201dMother Zheng Yufen looked at the rice bowl in front of Lu Sheng and said with some worry, \u201cHe ate half a bowl of rice less today than yesterday\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLu Qinghe stood up, shook her head slightly, and said, \u201cMom, Dad, I\u2019m also going back to my room to practice.\u201dWith that said, Lu Qinghe quickly ran back to her room.Perhaps due to the big changes that occurred in Lu Sheng recently, Lu Qinghe felt an inexplicable sense of threat in her heart, and she practised more diligently than before.Lu Dahai smiled as he rubbed his wife\u2019s hands and comforted her, \u201cThe children have matured; they are smart and know how to study hard. This is a good thing, we don\u2019t need to worry too much. Oh, and this money is for you; go buy some Bone-Strengthening pills for Xiao Sheng and Xiao Qinghe\u2026\u201d\u201cYou were complaining about your back pain yesterday, but you still went to another part-time job? Are you okay?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal, you can just put two plasters on me later\u2026\u201d\u201cWhere will I even put them\u2026\u201d\u2014 \u2014 \u2014[Inside Lu Sheng\u2019s Room]Lu Sheng listened to his parents talking in the living room, then took a deep breath, and slowly calmed down.His five senses had been substantially enhanced as a result of the increase in Blood Qi Value; even through a door, he could still hear the voices outside.A certain knot in Lu Sheng\u2019s heart became increasingly tighter.After doing two sets of the Body Refining Technique to clear the distracting thoughts in his mind, Lu Sheng slowly entered the dream world.Currently, he could control his brain to easily fall asleep in a short amount of time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Against opponents whose abilities are weaker than mine, it\u2019s practically like an adult beating a child.\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s eyes revealed some joy.After taking care of the zombie, Lu Sheng continued to move forward.He had been walking through the wilderness shrouded in the grey fog for an unknown amount of time. According to his estimation, he should be extremely close to Base 1359 in the memories of those zombies.\u201cAccording to the memory of those zombies before their death, Base 1359 should have been destroyed by a black fog and an almost endless tide of foreign monsters. It\u2019s strange that I haven\u2019t encountered a single foreign monster in a long time\u2026\u201d\u201cAre all foreign monsters dwelling in the base\u2019s ruins?\u201d\u201cOr did they leave after destroying the base?\u201dLu Sheng had no idea.Although the strength of his martial art had significantly improved, the dream world was still dangerous and unknown to him.So far, Lu Sheng hasn\u2019t died in a dream, he also doesn\u2019t know what the consequences of dying in a dream will be, and he doesn\u2019t want to find out either.Along the way, Lu Sheng killed a few more zombies.The martial arts memories obtained from these zombies gradually filled the gaps in his legs, palms, footwork, and so on, as they kept approaching the bottleneck.Simultaneously, the martial arts attainments that have achieved a new realm continued to slowly and steadily progress towards a higher level.Just as Lu Sheng punched the head of a zombie and was absorbing its memory, his eyes were suddenly stunned.Lu Sheng looked in the direction in front of him.The grey fog dispersed like flowing water, and the outline of a ruined yet magnificent structure slowly appeared in his field of vision.\u201cFinally\u2026 I\u2019m here\u2026\u201dThe Legendary Base: 1359.Lu Sheng\u2019s heart was unusually calm, and he was more cautious.Sometimes, the unknown also indicates danger.Furthermore, Lu Sheng had seen Base 1359 being submerged in an overwhelming wave of foreign monsters on numerous occasions in the memories he obtained.Despair and oppression had always weighed heavily on his heart like a boulder.Lu Sheng moved quickly, but his steps were light.The closer he got to the massive city, the more zombies there were wandering in the grey fog, and as the number increased, the strength of the zombies also continued to increase.Lu Sheng had already sensed the dangerous, long-lost aura emanating from a number of zombies.Fortunately, despite the improvement in strength, the perception of these zombies wasn\u2019t that great. As long as he was careful enough, he wouldn\u2019t attract their attention.Something that appears close but in reality is very far away.Even with him rushing, Lu Sheng ran for more than half an hour before gradually approaching the massive city,One could imagine just how big the scale of the city was.Lu Sheng finally arrived at the foot of the massive city.He hid behind some rubble and looked up at the city in front of him.This magnificent city was displayed right in front of him.It was hard to describe just how big this city was.Lu Sheng had to tilt his head close to its limit just to barely see the top of the city wall.The entire city was surrounded by towering city walls.This reminded Lu Sheng of a certain anime from his previous life in which characters hid in a massive besieged city to fight against evil giants.[TL/N: \u201cAttack on Titan\u201d reference anyone?]Compared to that anime, the city walls in front of him were undoubtedly much taller.It\u2019s difficult to imagine any force in the world breaking through such an impenetrable line of defence.But what Lu Sheng witnessed, were instead, massive, horrifying cracks.Looking from the outside, the entire city resembled a gigantic broken bowl full of holes.The rubble that Lu Sheng was leaning on right now was also a small piece of debris from the gigantic broken bowl.Lu Sheng\u2019s face turned solemn as he thought of the depressing scenes he had seen in his memory.Perhaps the apocalypse scenes he had seen in his memory were only one ten-thousandth of the actual situation.Height determines the field of view.For those zombies he could kill easily, the despair they saw before their death was undoubtedly only the tip of the real horror.\u201cBase 1359, in other words, there are at least a thousand other bases like this.\u201d\u201cSo, where are the other bases? Are they even still standing?\u201d\u201cWhat did the people of this world experience, are there even any survivors?\u201dLu Sheng had many doubts in his heart.About the origin of this world, about this dream, the mysterious Body Refining Technique and Breathing Method he was currently practising\u2026He walked towards the massive city.He had a feeling that the truth was waiting for him ahead.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s hard to imagine what level of martial artist powerhouses these zombies were before they died to give me such a huge sense of danger\u2026\u201dLu Sheng sighed in his heart.There was no consciousness nor perception, only some fighting instinct that remained in the body.Even in such a state they still gave him a strong sense of danger.\u2018These zombies were certainly unimaginably powerful masters before they died.\u2019Lu Sheng carefully kept his distance from each zombie.After numerous experiments, he discovered that the safe distance between him and the zombies was about ten metres.As long as he doesn\u2019t approach within ten metres of the zombies, he won\u2019t be noticed and attract their agro.Lu Sheng approached the hole he was aiming for little by little, carefully avoiding the zombies roaming around.It was impossible to hide, so he picked up a stone from the ground and threw it into the distance to diverge the attention of the zombies.In this way, he was able to safely reach the foot of the target wall without any risk.Although the hole was large, it was still seven or eight metres above the ground.Fortunately, Lu Sheng now had the strength of a Level 1 Martial Artist, and a strong body, so with the help of the grooves and cracks in the wall he was able to easily climb to the hole.\u201cI\u2019m afraid this city wall is more than 20 metres thick, but it was still destroyed like this\u2026\u201dSheng walked through the hole, his heart pounding.After coming all the way inside the wall, the scene of the city was presented in front of Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes.The various tall buildings, streets, and designs all were vastly different from the real world in which Lu Sheng lived.There were many means of transportation scattered on the streets that Lu Sheng didn\u2019t know of.Although most of these were now destroyed and dilapidated.Above the ruins shrouded in grey fog, Lu Sheng could still imagine how prosperous this city once was.\u201cThis level of technological advancement far exceeds the world I live in now and even the world in my previous life\u2026\u201dLu Sheng jumped down from the city wall and landed on a vehicle that resembled a rowboat, with smooth lines and a futuristic appearance.\u201cThis was probably a world with a highly advanced civilization, whether it was a technological civilization or martial arts civilization.\u201d\u201cNo wonder the Body Refinement Technique and Breathing Method from the memories are so profound\u2026\u201dThe world Lu Sheng was living in now, the development of Martial Arts had only been around for less than three hundred years.Many aspects were still in their Exploratory Stage.It was also mentioned in the history books that when martial arts were just emerging, the most powerful Martial Arts Experts in the world were only Level 5.But now, humans have numerous Level 7 Masters, Level 8 Grandmasters, and even Level 9 Martial Arts Saints.\u201cSuch a powerful civilization still fell under the claws of the foreign monsters, what about us\u2026\u201dLu Sheng suddenly became a little worried.His real world was also fighting against the invasion of the foreign monsters.Even if more human Martial Art Powerhouses continue to emerge, the entire human civilization\u2019s habitable space has been compressed and reduced.Something that was broadcasted on the news almost every day.\u201cStill, getting here is a great opportunity for me\u2026\u201d\u201cThis world fell, but my world might not\u2026\u201d\u201cI can get resources from this civilization, and in the future when I become stronger, I might be able to spread the advanced martial arts information from here\u2026\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s eyes became firm once again, and at the same time he felt the weight of heavy responsibility on his shoulders.The shock and impact of the devastated ruin of civilization was too much for him, as his mentality shifted as well.There were many zombies within the city walls, but their strength was generally low, and there were just a few \u201chigh-level monsters\u201d on rare occasions.This could be easily explained.The city walls protected the vulnerable civilians, while those who were powerful mostly converged on the front lines of the battlefield.Lu Sheng\u2019s exploration progressed a lot faster.He walked into a tall building.It was an ordinary residential building.Lu Sheng just found a random house and entered, but there was no one inside.The house was divided into multiple smaller rooms, but the overall space was very small.In the middle of the living room, there was a table with some dishes and tableware scattered on top.Lu Sheng imagined the family that was eating at that time, just before their end.Lu Sheng\u2019s mood became inexplicably gloomy.There were no zombies inside the house, and according to Lu Sheng\u2019s assumption, amid the terrifying black fog, ordinary people might\u2019ve not even had the qualifications to transform into zombies.It was also possible that they did once turn into zombies, but due to being too weak, they decayed over time to the eroding effect of many long years.Lu Sheng entered a room and noticed something resembling a picture frame on the bedside table, but there were no pictures in it.He assumed it to be something akin to a digital picture gallery, so when the energy ran out, the picture in it disappeared.\u201cThe last one should be the kid\u2019s room.\u201dIn the corner of the room, there was a single bed, a bookshelf, and a desk.Lu Sheng searched for things that could contain information.But, this world\u2019s civilization was too advanced, books were entirely liberated from the restraints of paper, and he found nothing.At last, Lu Sheng discovered a palm-sized, lead-grey, less than half-centimetre-thick disc on the desk, with traces of some text.\u201cTian\u2026 Heng\u2026 Technology\u2026\u201dLu Sheng wiped away the dust on the disc and recognized a few small letters engraved on the bottom of it.After reading those letters, Lu Sheng was shocked.How was he able to identify those words?!The language of this world\u2019s fallen civilization\u2026 was the same as his real world!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Or is there some connection between the two worlds\u2026?\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s eyes flashed, as if he had caught hold of something.He quickly picked up the disc and examined it closely.The disc\u2019s surface was so smooth that no buttons were visible.Lu Sheng had no idea what the disc was, so he could only inspect it inch by inch.Soon after, he noticed a millimetre-deep groove in the centre of the disk.Lu Sheng held out his hand for comparison and discovered that the groove was exactly the size of his thumb.\u201cA Fingerprint scanner?\u201dLu Sheng analysed it, and then carefully inserted his thumb into the groove.After waiting for a minute or so, Lu Sheng was just about to give up.Right then, he heard a \u201cbeep\u201d sound, as the entire disc in his hand began to emit a faint blue light.The blue light was becoming increasingly bright, but it wasn\u2019t blinding.With the emergence of the blue light, the dusty and lifeless room appeared to slowly become lively.[Welcome user, Tianheng Technology\u2026]A soft feminine voice came from the disc.Then, the blue light from the disc began to gradually condense into the silhouette of a woman.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it actually worked!\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s heart pounded with excitement.But the excitement didn\u2019t last long, as the disc in his hand appeared to have consumed all of its energy and quickly dimmed.After a few seconds, it reverted to a cold metal disc.Phew!Lu Sheng exhaled, and a bright light flashed in his eyes.\u201cLooks like there\u2019s still some energy left in this city. If I\u2019m lucky, maybe I can find more information about this world\u2026\u201dLu Sheng picked up the disc and quickly walked out of the room.He began exploring door-to-door, and in the process found a few more discs in different colours and designs than the first one.Lu Sheng guessed that the discs were something similar to a computer, which was common in many households and was mostly found in the living room and bedroom.Lu Sheng gathered about a dozen similar discs and finally attempted to activate them one by one in a certain spot.Before his eyes, a faint blue light flashed on and off.The majority of the discs were depleted, while the rest were either damaged or prompted Lu Sheng that he lacked sufficient access permission.[Password required\u2026]Lu Sheng felt a little hopeless.At last, things finally turned around as Lu Sheng picked up a silver-grey coloured disc.This disc was found by Lu Sheng in a box, and he hadn\u2019t had time to unpack it.[Welcome, Tianheng Technology\u2026]The blue light condensed into a hand-sized female figure, dressed in a pink outfit with perfect body proportions.Lu Sheng waited for a while and was relieved when there was no prompt, such as a [Password required] window popped up.\u201cHow do I use this?\u201dLu Sheng paused for a moment.But, almost immediately, the blue-light beauty in front of him smiled and said.[Users using Optical Brain for the first time can operate it according to the following instructions\u2026]Fortunately, there was a tutorial for new users.Lu Sheng breathed a sigh of relief.Under the intelligent instruction of the Optical Brain, he quickly understood how to use it.\u201cThe next step is to gradually comprehend the course of this world\u2026\u201dLu Sheng took a deep breath and, after some thought, gave a command.\u201cHelp me bring up information on news from the most recent date.\u201d[Connecting to Skynet\u2026][Skynet connection failed.][Connecting to Base 1359 civilian database\u2026][Connection successful.]In the next moment, a large amount of information flashed across Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes.Wherever Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes focused, the text in the corresponding position was enlarged and actively presented to him.\u201cOn June 21, 11024 Martial Calendar, Main Base No.2 successfully launched the 58th batch of life exploration spaceships, destination Lyra solar system\u2026\u201d\u201cOn July 12, 11024 Martial Calendar, Base 105 fell\u2026\u201d\u201cOn September 24, 11024 Martial Calendar, Lieutenant General Sun Changhe was promoted to level 10 Stellar Realm, becoming the 472nd level 10 Stellar Realm powerhouse in the history of the Global Martial Alliance.

He was always calm, and his joy and anger were nowhere to be seen. But, at this moment, his face was full of shock and disbelief.He looked through the first hundred years of this world\u2019s history and discovered that they heavily overlapped with what he had learnt in history class.The time, the historical figures, the historical events\u2026 were exactly the same.The information from martial arts years 310 to 315 gave him the illusion that he was flipping through old newspapers in the present time.Lu Sheng finally had an unimaginable, incomprehensible conclusion-The dream world, and the real world he currently inhabited\u2026Are exactly the same!The information he had just scanned through was not the history of some other world\u2019s martial arts civilization from prosperity to extinction, rather\u2026The future of his world!10,000 years in the future!\u201cMartial Calendar 11024, that is to say, my current world will be completely destroyed in 10,000 years.\u201d\u201cPerish in the overwhelming black fog, perish in the endless wave of foreign monsters\u2026\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s face turned pale, and he was unable to accept the result.Just a minute ago, he expressed grief for the demise of this glorious civilization.A minute later, he discovered he was grieving for the future of his own civilization.\u201cNot certainly\u2026 It might not be the same, it could be a coincidence, or it could be a parallel world\u2026\u201dLu Sheng comforted himself and tried his best to calm down.He needed further information to confirm.Lu Sheng tried to zoom in on the world history and piece together clues with smaller clues.But this time, Optical Brain prompted.[Insufficient permissions, guest users cannot inquire.]Lu Sheng frowned slightly and said, \u201cGenerate a user.\u201d[Please provide a genetic blood sample.]The Optical Brain of future technology actually required genetic blood samples to generate users, it was truly fascinating.Lu Sheng wasn\u2019t sure whether it would work in the dream, but he bit his index finger and dripped a drop of blood on the groove in the center of the Optical Brain.After Lu Sheng dripped the blood drop, the Optical Brain fell silent for more than ten minutes.Just when Lu Sheng wondered if it had died, the Optical Brain finally made a sharp \u201cbeep!\u201d sound.It wasn\u2019t a prompt for new users being generated successfully, but-[The human genetic blood sample has been detected, project \u2018Ember\u2019 has been initiated\u2026][Connecting to Ember Database 1359\u2026][Connection successful.][Permissions granted!]In the next moment, a large piece of information popped up in front of Lu Sheng.[Name: Lu Sheng][Gender: Male][Lifespan: June 297 \u2013 August 334, Martial Calendar][Martial Arts Strength: Level 4 Martial Artist][Authority: Level 2][\u2026]At the top of the prompt was a picture of a person.In the picture was a handsome middle-aged man with a resolute face, which Lu Sheng was very familiar with.That man was Lu Sheng himself!Lu Sheng calmly continued to read below, all information about his life.\u201c\u2026Graduated from Baihe No.3 Middle School in Baihe City and entered Baihe Wuhan University that year ranked 1st in school and 23rd in Baihe City\u2026\u201d\u201cThree years later, after graduating from Baihe Wuhan University, enlisted in the military region.\u201d\u201cAfter serving in the Southern Military Region\u2026\u201d\u201cAt the age of 37, died on the battlefields of the Southern Military Region in August 334.\u201d\u201cUnmarried.\u201d\u201cHighest military rank: Lieutenant General.\u201d\u201cMilitary Feats: First-class x1, Second-class x5, Third-class x12\u2026\u201d\u201cNo exceptional contribution.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cIn other words, I will die at the age of 37, on the battlefield with foreign monsters, and I will only be a Level 4 Martial Artist till I die.

Do you not have to go to school today?\u201dZheng Yufen carried the breakfast bowls to the table and asked Lu Sheng with curiosity, who was sitting at the table for breakfast in a casual outfit.Lu Sheng picked up a meat bun and nodded, \u201cYes, the teacher said you can study on your own at home from now on\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s such a thing\u2026?\u201dZheng Yufen murmured doubtfully, but at the same time, she was working multiple odd jobs and didn\u2019t have the energy to give it much thought, so she didn\u2019t ask any further questions.Next to him, Lu Qinghe was habitually about to say, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t I heard anything about this new rule in No.3 Middle School?\u201d but when she met Lu Sheng\u2019s dark and deep eyes, she forcefully swallowed it back.[TL/N: She can swallow something else too, if you get what I mean. *wink* ]\u201cThis guy\u2026\u201dLu Qinghe fiercely took a bite out of the bun in her hand.Recently, the changes in her brother, Lu Sheng, had become increasingly greater, and he was no longer mediocre and cowardly.Previously, she felt that Lu Sheng had gotten somewhat profound and mysterious.But today, Lu Sheng gave her the feeling of a mountain, a solid block of iron, a blazing fire\u2026an ember!Even as she sat next to Lu Sheng, she felt an oppressive sensation as if she couldn\u2019t breathe.The sensation was awful.Lu Qinghe\u2019s abnormality wasn\u2019t noticed by Lu Sheng. He quickly finished his breakfast before returning to his room to start practising the Body Refining Technique.After doing the Body Refining Technique for the fourth time, Lu Sheng\u2019s phone rang with a call from an unfamiliar number.\u201cLu Sheng, your scholarship is here. Come to the school in the afternoon to receive it.\u201dUnsurprisingly, the call was from Zhong Zhengguo.\u201cUnderstood, Teacher Zhong.\u201d\u201cAnd why didn\u2019t you come to class today, by the way? Didn\u2019t I say that the school needs to hold a meeting to discuss your school schedule? Thankfully, I remembered not to call your parents and asked your classmates for your personal phone number instead.\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhong, I don\u2019t have much time, so I can\u2019t waste even a second.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201dLu Sheng hung up the phone, not caring if Zhong Zhenguo on the other end of the call understood what he said.Since returning from the dream world last night, Lu Sheng\u2019s mentality had completely changed.Prior to this, Lu Sheng had carefully concealed his strength, not daring to reveal it to too many people or to expose it in a crowded place.He considered numerous factors, and it was difficult to explain it to his family.But now, Lu Sheng no longer considered any of it.He only wanted to be more prominent and shock others.Only by demonstrating more talents can he receive more resources.He needed to climb to the top as fast as possible, and then find some ways to change the future.He couldn\u2019t afford to waste even one moment.In addition, Lu Sheng also wanted to use this to confirm an idea in his mind.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014Lu Sheng practised the Body Refining Technique coupled with the Breathing Method repeatedly.Over and over again.With the purpose of draining his energy as quickly as possible, producing a sense of exhaustion, and then entering the dream world.When Lu Sheng performed the Body Refining for the 27th time, he was so exhausted that he collapsed onto the ground, not wanting to move even a single finger.Drowsiness overtook him, and he gradually fell asleep.When he opened his eyes, he was in the exact position he had left the day before, with an Optical Brain in front of him.Lu Sheng skillfully activated the Optical Brain and gave a command.\u201cBring up all the cultivation methods, insights, and notes related to martial arts that I can inquire about within my authority\u2026\u201d[Search in progress\u2026]Soon, a huge amount of information appeared in front of Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes.Densely packed, all of them related to martial arts.It was too much.With the accumulation of more than 10,000 years, from the insight and wisdom of innumerable people, even if Lu Sheng\u2019s authority was only level 2, the information that he could obtain was immense.Lu Sheng thought for a moment before continuing, \u201cFilter the most suitable practices for Level 1 Martial Artists, and the most useful information.\u201d[Filtering in progress\u2026]All the information in front of Lu Sheng started to rapidly decrease, and finally, the information left in front of him\u2026. was only three.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Furthermore, the [Natural Breathing Method] can assist martial artists to enter a state of heavenly unification, which contains unparalleled benefits for growth in the martial arts realm.\u201d\u201cThe [Crystal Contemplation Technique], purifies the mind and strengthens the will, involves the most mysterious part of spiritual power in martial arts practice.\u201dThe focus of these three techniques differed, but they were all chosen by the Optical Brain and were most suited for level 1 martial artists to build their foundation \u2013 the Introductory level.Lu Sheng couldn\u2019t wait to try them out.Although the results of practice in the dream world couldn\u2019t be brought into reality. However, becoming acquainted with the technique in the dream world will help hasten the progress in reality.Lu Sheng first practised [Stellar Body Refining Technique] and [Natural Breathing Method].Even at the introductory level, the grades of these two techniques were too high, and without the aid of memory proficiency, they would leave Lu Sheng\u2019s, a Level 1 Martial Artist, foundation exhausted for half a day before he could even begin.The moment Lu Sheng performed the last movement of the [Stellar Body Refining Technique], his entire body trembled as if he had received an electric shock.Like a surging tide, the incomparably intense pain and numbness quickly spread to every part of Lu Sheng\u2019s body.Even the muscles and meridians located at the tip of the pinky finger were shocked and tempered.The pain lasted for more than half an hour before gradually diminishing, followed by an unparalleled sense of relief.Lu Sheng was so immersed in the intense pleasure of practice that his soul seemed to be leaving his body.If the [Body Refining Technique] he had previously practised had an effect of 1, then the [Stellar Body Refining Technique] in combination with the [Natural Breathing Method] had an effect of 1,000 or even higher.And his first technique, promoted by the Martial Union, the \u201824 basic Body Refining Techniques\u2019 effect would be completely negligible.Not any different from aerobic gymnastics.After practising just once, Lu Sheng collapsed on the ground, completely unable to move.Taking advantage of this time, Lu Sheng began trying to practice the [Crystal Contemplation Technique].The concept of the [Crystal Contemplation Technique] was both wonderful and mysterious.The practitioner\u2019s initial step would be to visualize a human figure carved entirely out of crystal in their mind.The crystal human figure must be full of impurities at first, then, with each breath, little by little, all impurities would be removed, until it\u2019s completely pure.Although Lu Sheng couldn\u2019t fully comprehend the concepts and effects taught by [Crystal Contemplation Technique].Nevertheless, he also knew the significance of spiritual will in martial arts practice.A martial artist with a strong will and no distracting thoughts will far exceed a martial artist with a weak will and many desires, both in terms of combat power and practice speed.As a result, there have always been a lot of ascetics in the martial arts world.However, while the [Crystal Contemplation Technique] was magical, the difficulty of practice was also very high.Even with the assistance of the Optical Brain, which constructed a three-dimensional crystal human figure in front of Lu Sheng, he was still unable to visualize a crystal human figure in his own mind.It could only be done gradually in the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019m just not sure by how much\u2026\u201dLu Sheng walked out of the bathroom with wet hair, and looked up at the wall clock, \u201cIt\u2019s almost time to go to school.\u201d\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\u201cNext time, at least greet me first.\u201dZhong Zhengguo handed Lu Sheng a bank card[1] and reprimanded him with some dissatisfaction.[1: A debit card or cash card.]\u201cUnderstood, Teacher Zhong.\u201dZhong Zhengguo opened his mouth to speak further, but when he saw Lu Sheng\u2019s face as calm as water, he closed it again.\u201cGo, go, and come to school at least once a week from now on.\u201dZhong Zhengguo helplessly waved his hand.\u201cYes.\u201dLu Sheng took the bank card, turned around, and left.Zhong Zhengguo had an inexplicable feeling in his heart as he stared at Lu Sheng\u2019s departing back.It was a very strange feeling, hard to describe.If it had to be described, it would be;The original Lu Sheng, Zhong Zhengguo, was able to see right through him.However, the current Lu Sheng, Zhong Zhengguo, wasn\u2019t able to see through him at all.And this change occurred in the middle of one day.Zhong Zhengguo shook his head.\u2018It\u2019s not something I can figure out right now, I should stop thinking about it.\u2019\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\u201cFinally, I have some money\u2026\u201dLu Sheng walked out of Zhong Zhengguo\u2019s office, and for the first time, his heart felt a little lighter.Of course, the money couldn\u2019t be spent immediately on supplements; that would be a waste.\u201cBuying materials and combining them myself will be the most efficient way to use this money.\u201dLu Sheng had just searched the Ember Database for a number of pill formulas, which could now come in handy.However, even though the Optical Brain filtered out various formulas that could be attained in his era, determining which type was best suitable for the current Lu Sheng required further filtering.The primary filtering condition for this step was money.Lu Sheng went straight to an Internet cafe near the school and searched online.Zhong Zhengguo would definitely vomit blood from anger if he saw his most valued student turn around and go into an Internet cafe after negotiating with him on the condition of free rein during school hours.He swiftly registered and logged onto a computer.The Internet cafe was filled with smoke, Lu Sheng casually took a seat.On his left and right, several teens were playing games.They appeared to be about his age, with colourful hair and tattoos on their arms.After seeing Lu Sheng sit down and turn on the computer to search for information, the teens glanced at him and sneered.Lu Sheng ignored them and looked up the information one by one with the formulas in his mind.Mainly to check the price of the materials.Then, by calculating the cost of each formula he\u2019d choose the best one based on cost-effectiveness.Soon, Lu Sheng found two that were suitable for him.Muscle and Blood Invigorating Decoction, and Marrow Nourishing pill!The materials for these two pills were widely available on the market, and the price was also reasonable, something Lu Sheng could afford.Among them, the effect of the Marrow Nourishing pills was a little better, but Lu Sheng saw that one of the herbs needed to be freshly harvested and used within a few hours for it to be effective.And that herb didn\u2019t grow in Baihe City.\u201cThen I\u2019ll choose the Muscle and Blood Invigorating Decoction, since the preparation for it is also relatively simple, it\u2019s ideal for a novice like me\u2026\u201dLu Sheng made up his mind.There was only one problem left for him to consider.\u201cNow, where can I prepare the decoction?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24: Xingshan Hall!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cEven making a simple decoction requires professional tools, and the slightest changes in temperature or dosage will significantly worsen the effect\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s unrealistic for me to buy them myself, and the money I have on hand is also not enough.\u201d\u201cIt will be better to rent it from somewhere else.\u201dLu Sheng was a little distressed.A place where they prepare medicines; a drug research institute, a large pharmacy, or a pharmaceutical company should have it.But the question is, why would anyone rent it to him?How can they just let anybody in, let alone rent out an important facility such as the compounding room, that holds commercial secrets of many pharmaceutical companies?\u201cForget it; let\u2019s first purchase all the herbs required to make the Muscle and Blood Invigorating Decoction, and then I\u2019ll think of a way.\u201d\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\u201cAre you joking, sir? This is absolutely impossible.\u201dSeeing that the face of the pharmacist in front of him turn dark, Lu Sheng quickly stood up and left.\u201cThe seventh store\u2026 sure enough, this isn\u2019t realistic\u2026\u201dLu Sheng sighed softly as he walked out of the pharmacy, with a look of hopelessness on his face.He had already bought all of the herbs required to make the Muscle and Blood Invigorating Decoction, even buying several extras.Because the money in the card Zhong Zhenguo gave him wasn\u2019t 30,000, but a whopping 80,000!The extra 50,000 was most likely Zhong Zhenguo\u2019s personal sponsorship.However, the process of renting a compounding room was far from smooth. Lu Sheng visited seven pharmaceutical companies and pharmacies, all of which turned him down.\u201cThis is the last one, if it doesn\u2019t succeed this time, I can only buy some cheap equipment online and try\u2026\u201dLu Sheng thought to himself as he stared at the eighth pharmacy that appeared in his field of vision.In front of the pharmacy was a signboard that read \u201cXingshan Hall.\u201dSuch a store name was uncommon in Baihe City.Lu Sheng fixed his clothes and walked in.The pharmacy wasn\u2019t large, but there were some medicine cabinets on display. A young man in a white coat was laying on the counter, playing with his phone.Hearing the sound of Lu Sheng entering the door, the young man raised his head and looked at him, then quickly lowered his head again.\u201cWhat do you want to buy, look around by yourself, come back to me when you want to check out.\u201dHe added suddenly, as if he remembered something, \u201cdon\u2019t think of taking things and running, there\u2019s surveillance, and the cameras are quite clear.\u201dAfter speaking, the young man returned his attention to his phone.Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes narrowed.The store\u2019s business didn\u2019t seem to be booming.No matter which pharmacy Lu Sheng went to before, no matter how rude the receptionist was, they would immediately ask him what he needed.The receptionist in this store, on the other hand, simply ignored him, clearly not interested in doing business.How can such a shop be successful?Of course, whether the store\u2019s business was successful or not had nothing to do with Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng approached the counter, reached out, and snatched the phone from the young man\u2019s hands.\u201cYou wanna die?!\u201dThe young man\u2019s gaze shifted away from the phone screen, as he was on the verge of becoming enraged.But as soon as he looked Lu Sheng in the eyes and felt the overwhelming aura emanating from him, he softened up again in an instant.\u201cYou\u2026 what do you want?\u201dThe young man quickly took two steps back, looked at Lu Sheng with fear, and occasionally glanced at the phone in Lu Sheng\u2019s hand.Lu Sheng calmly said, \u201cI have something to ask you. Does your pharmacy have its own medicine compounding room?\u201d\u201cWhat about it? So what if there isn\u2019t? Are you not here to buy medicine?\u201dThe young man responded quickly.\u201cIf there is, I would like to discuss business with you,\u201d Lu Sheng replied casually as he extended out his finger and lightly tapped on the glass counter.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014[Five minutes later.]Lu Sheng followed the young man to the door of a room behind the pharmacy.The young man\u2019s expression appeared a little nervous, and he repeatedly confirmed with Lu Sheng, \u201cOkay, 200 yuan per hour, less than one hour will still count as one hour, at most you can use it for three hours, after three hours\u2026\u201d\u201cAlso, you have to pay 200 yuan for the first hour in advance.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dLu Sheng casually took out 200 yuan and handed it to the young man.The young man\u2019s eyes lit up. He immediately stuffed the money into his pocket after receiving it, then took out a key, opened the door, and told Lu Sheng, \u201cOkay, enter quickly. Be careful not to break anything, or you will need to compensate accordingly. \u201c\u201cI know.\u201dLu Sheng entered the room without hesitation.The young man returned to the store quickly, pretending to be nonchalant, but his expression was filled with delight that he couldn\u2019t hide.\u2018What a great deal, isn\u2019t this getting money for nothing? I just need to go back and delete the surveillance footage\u2026\u2019Lu Sheng looked around the room, satisfied with what he saw.The compounding room wasn\u2019t big, but it had all the tools he needed to get started.The pharmacists of Xingshan Hall clearly took good care of these tools and used them frequently; all of the tools were spotless and very clean.Lu Sheng didn\u2019t waste time.The young man who agreed to rent him the compounding room clearly had little say in the matter and was very sneaky.He needed to complete his objective as fast as possible to prevent the people from the Xingshan Hall from returning and adding to the trouble.\u201cMuscle and Blood Invigorating Decoction\u2026\u201dLu Sheng put on a white pharmacist coat, and a mask, and began processing the medicinal materials one by one according to the Muscle and Blood Invigorating Decoction formula.This was the most difficult and important step in contrast to the final mix.Fortunately, making Muscle and Blood Invigorating Decoction wasn\u2019t difficult; the process was similar to that of regular chemical experiments, albeit a little more time-consuming.Gurgle~ Gurgle~ Gurgle~~Lu Sheng carefully poured the boiled medicinal decoction into a flask.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect things to go so well on the first try\u2026\u201dLu Sheng watched the medicinal decoction in the flask gradually cool down, revealing a beautiful pale green colour, and felt a little excited in his heart.However, whether it was a success or not could only be determined by tasting and feeling its effect.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25: He Lingsu!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLu Sheng removed his mask and poured the entire medicinal decoction in the flask into his mouth.The medicinal decoction entered his throat and quickly flowed into his stomach.Lu Sheng didn\u2019t even taste it.He stood there for a few seconds, silently waiting.Soon, a heat current flowed out of his body and spread throughout his body within a few breaths.Every muscle cell in Sheng Lu\u2019s body was greedily absorbing the heat current.It was similar to dry land suddenly being watered, or a sponge that had been left out in the sun being tossed into the water\u2026A white gas streamed out of Lu Sheng\u2019s skin, and the Blood Qi in his body started surging, and his entire body felt as if it was being rapidly filled.After ten minutes, the feeling slowly diminished and eventually went away.Lu Sheng stared brightly at the flask in his hand.He knew that he had succeeded.The effect of Muscle and Blood Invigorating Decoction was even better than he had expected, nearly ten times better than the Blood Nourishing Pill he had consumed before.And the cost of making it was less than twice that of the Blood Nourishing Pill.Lu Sheng also felt that his skin had become slightly tighter.This was stated in the formula.Since Muscle and Blood Invigorating Decoction was called such, it naturally had more than just one effect of invigorating blood.While invigorating the blood, it can also enhance the person\u2019s skin density, reduce pores, whiten and moisturize the skin, and have other additional effects.\u201cThe formula from the future is awesome, Even a bit of wisdom from 10,000 years can easily cause chaos in the present.\u201dLu Sheng couldn\u2019t help but sigh.The effect of the Muscle and Blood Invigorating Decoction he just consumed hadn\u2019t been completely absorbed, and there was still some of it in his body that had to be stimulated by performing the Stellar Body Refining Technique.Of course not right now; the most urgent task was to quickly combine all of the medicinal herbs on hand.With one successful experience, Lu Sheng\u2019s following compoundings went exceptionally smoothly.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014Knock! Knock! Knock!!Lu Sheng opened the door with a blank expression on his face.\u201cDidn\u2019t I say not to disturb me in the middle?\u201d\u201cOur boss will be back soon; you have to leave quickly!\u201dThe young man at the door looked nervous and continued to persuade.Lu Sheng\u2019s expression froze, and he didn\u2019t say anything to him. He immediately cleaned up the compounding room, took the prepared medicine, and walked out.Although the time was much earlier than what he had paid for, the good thing was that the twelve portions of Muscle and Blood Invigorating Decoction were prepared, which could be considered a complete success.Lu Sheng gave another 200 yuan to the young man and then left the Xingshan Hall.Before leaving, the young man specifically gave Lu Sheng his phone number, stating that the next time he needed to contact him, he could do so directly, seemingly with the intention to develop a long-term business.Lu Sheng walked steadily and fast while carrying twelve copies of the Muscle and Blood Invigorating Decoction.Now that he had Blood Qi supplements, he only wanted to improve his cultivation properly.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014He Lingsu dragged her tired body out of the car.He Lingsu was just twenty years old, with a delicate figure and a pretty face. She should have been the age to enjoy life to the fullest, like a flower, but she took up the family\u2019s burden very early.During the time period, the He family made a living from pharmaceuticals, and her ancestors even had a famous level 5 pharmacy in Baihe City, but when it was passed down to her father\u2019s generation, he slipped out of the way.The He family was still prosperous in He Lingsu\u2019s grandfather\u2019s generation. The Xingshan Hall\u2019s branches spread over several provinces, with a total of more than 100 branches.However, now, only two branches still remain in the entire Baihe City.\u201cMartial arts are developing rapidly, and the pharmaceutical industry tied to martial arts is also changing by the day. Every day, new and improved medicine formulas are developed, while the old ones are discarded and thrown out.\u201d\u201cThe reason my He Family has declined to this point is because it\u2019s too conservative and old-fashioned, following the old rules and not thinking about progressing\u2026\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t even think about it. Can martial arts pills that were popular a hundred years ago still sell well today? Many people couldn\u2019t even afford a pair of Blood Nourishing Pills for a month\u2019s salary at that time.\u201d\u201cThe only way to solve my He Family\u2019s current predicament is to develop new ideas.\u201dHe Lingsu has been doing the same thing.During this time, she had been searching for new martial arts pills as a way to save the He family\u2019s business.However, half a year down the line with little success.Yesterday, she had heard that an old pharmacist in the neighbouring city had created a new pill, so she rushed over there without delay.As a result, halfway through in the car, she received a phone call from the other side, telling her not to come, that a good partner had already been selected for the new pill.He Lingsu returned empty-handed.\u201cMiss He, you\u2019re back\u2026\u201dThe young man with the white coat greeted her as soon as she walked through the door.He Lingsu was upset and didn\u2019t have time to pay attention to him, so she simply nodded coldly.She had taken over the family pharmacy for a long while now, and she naturally knew exactly what the personal behaviour of the two store employees was like.This receptionist named Ma Fei was lazy, frequently left work, and occasionally stole pills from the store and sold them. She had warned him several times but he refused to change.If it weren\u2019t for the fact that she hadn\u2019t found a suitable replacement, she would have made him pack up and leave a long time ago.\u201cSo pretty, if only she was my girlfriend\u2026\u201dMa Fei continued to stare at He Lingsu\u2019s back until she disappeared from his field of vision; only then did he reluctantly withdraw his gaze.He Lingsu had always been the goddess of Ma Fei\u2019s dreams.The reason Ma Fei stayed at Xingshan Hall and refused to leave was because he fantasized how nice it would be to be fancied by He Lingsu one day.Although Xingshan Hall\u2019s current business wasn\u2019t very good. After all, a lean camel is bigger than a horse[1]. He also counted love and career as a double harvest and felt as if he already reached the peak of his life.[1: Meaning: The gap between a rich person and a poor person. Even if the rich one suffers property damage, the rest of their possessions will still be much greater than the poor\u2019s.]Although the possibility of this was smaller than the chance of winning the lottery. But, what if?It\u2019s difficult to guess the taste of a rich eldest lady.Isn\u2019t that how all those urban YY[2] novels go? An ordinary poor boy\u2026[2: Harem novels]Ma Fei was lying on the counter, aroused, when He Lingsu\u2019s figure suddenly reappeared in front of his eyes.[TL/N: This dude is down tremendous, smh, could never be me]\u201cHe\u2026 Miss He!\u201dMa Fei stood up with a jolt and wiped the drool from the corner of his mouth with his sleeve.At this moment, He Lingsu\u2019s pretty face had completely frozen into ice, and her expression was extremely unhappy.\u201cDid you sneak someone into my medicine compounding room?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 \u2014 The He Family Has Hope Yet!\u201cNo \u2026 No.\u201dMa Fei hurriedly shook his head in denial.Looking at the other party\u2019s stammering, flickering eyes, He Ling Su was almost certain.\u201cForget it, you don\u2019t have to come back to work tomorrow.\u201dHe Ling Su said indifferently.\u201cAh? ! Miss He, Miss He, listen to my explanation \u2026\u201dHe Ling Su no longer paid attention to Ma Fei, she simply turned around and left.Her mood today was already pretty bad, and then she had to run into this kind of thing. Her emotions nearly exploded.He Ling Su usually did research on new drugs in the mixing room when she had nothing else to do, so she knew everything in there, like the back of her hand.Just now, when she walked into the mixing room she found that many of the equipments and instruments had been moved from their place.Even her lab coat emitted the strong scent of man from the inside.\u201cBastard! Pisses me off!He Ling Su threw a tantrum as she cleaned up.She used tweezers to pick up the pharmacist\u2019s uniform that had been worn by someone and threw it directly into the trash.\u201cAll the equipments have to be sanitized, the table has to be cleaned with disinfectant again \u2026\u201dHe Ling Su was a neat freak, if not for her current circumstance, she\u2019d even have gone ahead and disposed of everything and brought new equipments.\u201cHmm? There is still an unwashed flask\u201dHe Ling Su suddenly noticed that a used flask was placed in an inconspicuous corner of the mixing table.There was still some light green liquid left in the bottle.\u201cHuh, it\u2019s disgusting \u2026\u201dHe Ling Su was full of disgust. She put on the gloves and threw the thing directly into the trash.But after throwing it, He Ling Su was overcome with a ghastly desire to pick up the flask from the trash and look at the flask.\u201cI must really be bewitched \u2026\u201dHe Ling Su laughed at herself.Recently, her mind was occupied with thoughts of new drugs and tonics that she even wanted to pick up the unknown liquid in the garbage can and study its contents.That said, He Ling Su still skillfully extracted some residual liquid from the flask and began to do pharmacological analysis.Ten minutes later.\u201cFuck, I\u2019m really unlucky to have run into this \u2026\u201dMa Fei cried and was packing up his things, ready to collect his things and leave.The thought of not having a chance to see his goddess tomorrow filled Ma Fei with regret.\u201cI should\u2019ve been swayed by a couple of hundreds that brat offered me. Now it\u2019s got me good \u2026\u201dMa Fei carried his things out of the Xingshan Tang and looked back with fondness in his eyes.\u201cGod, can you just give me a chance to take one final look at my goddess \u2026\u201dMa Fei sighed in his heart.The next moment, a miracle happened!He Ling Su really appeared in front of him.Not only that, He Ling Su was also running towards him. Her face filled with tension, anxiety, and urgency.\u201cMa Fei! Ma Fei! Ma Fei where are you? Damn, it can\u2019t be that you already left \u2026\u201d\u201cHoly shit! \u2026\u201dMa Fei was stunned.His fantasy had came true?Those web novel protagonists, those episodes only seen in novels, seemed to have crossed to real life and was running towards him, step by step \u2026A great joy and excitement rose in Ma Fei\u2019s heart, and he hurriedly spoke, \u201cLittle He \u2026! Ling Su, I\u2019m here!\u201d\u201cHuh?!\u201dHe Ling Su saw Ma Fei standing in the doorway with an excited face waving at her, and suddenly her eyes lit up.\u201cYou haven\u2019t left yet? \u2026\u201dHe Ling Su rushed out, grabbed Ma Fei\u2019s clothes and eagerly said, \u201cJust in time, I have something very important to ask you.\u201d\u201cAsk away. As long as it\u2019s something I know I\u2019ll tell you, Susu!\u201dMa Fei\u2019s face was overflowing with excitement and happiness.He Ling Su frowned when she heard Ma Fei address her, but she didn\u2019t have time to care about that at this moment.\u201cWhat kind of person did you bring into the mixing room today? I want to see him! Immediately! Immediately!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dMa Fei froze. This did not seem to follow the plot in web novels or the scenes that he imagined.\u201cAre you deaf? I said I want to see the man you brought into the mixing room today. If you can help me find him, I guarantee that not only will I let you continue working here, I\u2019ll also double your salary!\u201d\u201cUh \u2026 Oh, oh!\u201dMa Fei woke up from his daydream and took out his phone: \u201cI have his contact information.\u201d\u201cGive it to me!\u201dHe Ling Su was anxious as hell in her heart. What if she was delayed by a minute?It was no surprise that she was reacting the way she was. It was mainly because the test result on the residue had come, and it was \u2026 simply way too amazing!\u201cThe blood replenishment effect exceeds more than ten times than those tonics that available for less than 100,000 yuan on the market. Notwithstanding that, it also has additional properties of fairning, muscle building and other effects.\u201cNot just that, according to the analysis, the main components involved in this residual liquid are all common herbs available on the market. By preliminary estimates, the manufacturing cost of this liquid should not exceed more than 5000 yuan.\u201cThe most critical aspect of this liquid is that there is not tonic on the market that overlaps or is similar to it.

    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27 \u2014 MasterHoo-hoo-The small room almost transformed into a steamer.If someone stepped into the room, they would think they were in a sauna.It is obvious that Lu Sheng is the source of all this steam.The whole person seems to be a boiled kettle because of the thick heat coming out of his bodyIn the haze of the vapor, one could see Lu Sheng\u2019s muscles shaking slowly and rhythmically.He became fuller along with each breath.The explosive power packed beneath the skin could be felt even by the naked eye.Very quickly, Lu Sheng was done with the final exercise.But he did not open his eyes, but sat in place.His chest rose and fell, and a large amount of white steam was breathed from his nose and exhaled from his mouth. It swam around the room like a spiritual snake.He did not know how long this lasted, but when the vapor in the room gradually dissipated, Lu Sheng slowly opened his eyes.\u201cThis Stellar Body Refining Technique is truly worthy of being the most powerful Body Refining Technique 10,000 into the future; the latent potential it can unearth from a body is simply unimaginable. At this rate, a star might really germinate in my body \u2026\u201cThe Natural Breathing Technique also seems to possess an extremely strong recovery ability, without the cooperation of this breathing technique, the effect of the body refining technique would not be so good.\u201dLu Sheng fiercely clenched his fist, feeling the explosive power coursing through his fingers and palms. His face revealed a look of pure delight.\u201cMy BQV was enhanced yet again. Spiritual Muscle and Blood Strengthening Soup is very effective. With my current physique, it\u2019s enough if I consume two portions a day. I can\u2019t seem to digest more than that at the moment.Then according to this, If I do the math, then my current stock will last me six days, and I\u2019ll find more ways to procure them after that.\u201dDing-ring\u2013ring~ Ding-ring-ring~The phone rang suddenly.Lu Sheng picked up the phone.\u2014 Yes.\u2014 When? A week from now.Lu Sheng hung up the phone without waiting for the other side to speak.The person who called him was the young man from Xingshan Tang who had secretly rented him the mixing room.The other party said something about the mistress of Xingshan Tang wanting to see him now.Lu Sheng assented to the request, but the time had to be next time he came to utilize the mixing room.\u201cIt\u2019s time to concentrate on cultivation.\u201dLu Sheng did not forget the burden he was carrying on his shoulders.\u2026\u201cWell? What did the other party say?\u201dHe Ling Su stared at Ma Fei with an expectant face.\u201cHey, give me the phone, I\u2019ll talk to him myself!\u201dHe Ling Su directly grabbed Ma Fei\u2019s cell phone, but before she could answer it, she heard Ma Fei\u2019s helpless voice.\u201cHe hung up.\u201d\u201cThen call him back.\u201dHe Ling Su was not deterred and dialed again, but soon she heard\u00a0\u201cThe user you have dialed is switched off\u201d\u00a0prompt from the phone.\u201cAhhh, this is urgent!\u201dHe Ling Su vented on Ma Fei\u2019s phone and punched it twice, which made Ma Fei\u2019s face hurt.Miss, that is my phone ah \u2026 why not smash your own \u2026\u201cMiss He, in fact, he has promised to meet with us \u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dHe Ling Su\u2019s beautiful eyes lit up, \u201cReally? What did he say?\u201d\u201cHe said he\u2019ll meet, but we have to wait for a week.\u201d\u201cA week?\u201dThe surprise on He Ling Su\u2019s face quickly faded.\u201cA week is too long, there are too many variables, no-\u201dHe Ling Su shook her head.She had just experienced being shortchanged, that to within a span of half-a-day.A week?Flowers would\u2019ve already wilted by then.\u201cMiss He, it\u2019s not a matter of whether we take the initiative or not, but whether the other party is willing. Everything lies on his hands \u2026\u201d Ma Fei patiently explained to He Ling Su.\u201cOf course I know.\u201d He Ling Su said coldly. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I can\u2019t afford to wait for a week.\u201dHe Ling Su ordered Ma Fei: \u201cFrom now on, you are responsible for helping me find that master, the sooner, the better. The sooner you complete the task, I\u2019ll reward you with you with 5,000 \u2026 no, 10,000 yuan for everyday you manage to save!\u201d\u201cReally?!\u201dHearing that there was a reward, Ma Fei immediately perked up.\u201cMiss He, you have to keep your word\u201d\u201cWhen have I ever not kept my word \u2026\u201dHe Ling Su was overcome with impatience, and was both excited and nervous. She was both eager and terrified. It was difficult to describe her current mood.Ma Fei was thinking about the amount he would get as a reward when he suddenly remembered and said something worriedly, \u201cMiss He, I think you\u2019re mistaken about something? The person who asked me to lend him the mixing room was only a teenager, perhaps a high schooler. Could he really be a that master pharmacist as you said he was?\u201d\u201cA student? \u2026\u201dHe Ling Su frowned slightly and whispered to herself, \u201cThen perhaps, there is a master pharmacist behind him \u2026?\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dMa Fei nodded his head in understanding.\u2026\u201cScholarship?!\u201dAt the dining table, Lu Hai, Zheng Yufen and Lu Qinghe looked at Lu Sheng with wide eyes, as if they were listening to a story.\u201cYou mean to say that you bought this thing for me with your scholarship? \u201dLu Hai asked again in disbelief as he held a white, flashlight-like instrument.\u201cIt\u2019s a blood moxibustion device.\u201dLu Sheng corrected, then took out another two thousand yuan and put it on the table, \u201cThere\u2019s still two thousand left, I\u2019ll hand it to mom to cover for our food expenses.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still some left?!\u201dLu Hai\u2019s eyes widened, wondering if his eyes were failing him or his ears were mishearing.Zheng Yufen was overjoyed, with the notes stuffed in her hands, and hugged Lu Sheng.\u201cMy son got a scholarship! How impressive \u2026\u201dNext to him, Lu Qinghe couldn\u2019t help but mutter, \u201cWhat scholarship hands out so much money? What kind of scholarship can you even get \u2026\u201d\u201cStudy Progress Award. My BQV has risen very quickly during this period of time, so I was evaluated for it.\u201dLu Sheng did not even blink when he told the lie.Lu Qinghe obviously did not believe it and wanted to say more, but after meeting Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes, she closed her mouth again.Lu Hai and Zheng Yufen obviously believed it.The main thing was that recently Lu Sheng had changed a lot, especially the appetite part.With these recent changes, plus how their son won a scholarship, they did not see a reason to doubt their son.\u201cYou should\u2019ve used this money to buy more tonic. Instead, you bought his blood whatnot device. Such a waste of money \u2026\u201d\u201cOh, this is my son\u2019s first scholarship. What is wrong with him buying a gift for you? Besides, you have been crying about your back pain a lot lately. It\u2019s a good idea to use it. I saw on TV that this stuff is very effective \u2026\u201d\u201cHow good could it be \u2026\u201dThough Lu Hai said that it was wasteful, but in fact, he was elated on the inside. And before he even finished his meal, he took the gadget to the sofa and started to fiddle with it.Mother Zheng Yufen also smiled brightly and counted the 2000 yuan like it was a treasure over and over again. Nattering about how she would save it for Lu Sheng so that he could use it for college later. Lu Sheng saw all this and felt incomparably serene and happy. He was so desperate to cultivate and get stronger and let his family live a better life.His dad could be more relaxed, and his mother would not have to worry over money every single day. And also let Lu Qinghe \u2026Lu Sheng turned his head to look at Lu Qinghe.Lu Qinghe was staring at him furtively, but when she noticed his eyes on her, she immediately turned her head to the side, pretending to be aloof and nonchalant.Hmmn. Lu Qinghe will have to wait. I\u2019ll think about it after she becomes a bit more sensible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 \u2014 The Spirit is Undying, Stellar Power Generation!Base 1359.Lu Sheng stood in the middle of a dilapidated street.At a distance of ten meters from him, there stood a tall zombie.This zombie was missing a left arm and had a huge wound over thirty centimeters long on its chest.It tilted its head slightly, its hollow eyes gazing longingly in one direction.Lu Sheng followed its lines of sight, and he saw the huge fissure in the city wall that he had passed by on his way in.Lu Sheng was silent for a moment, and then slowly took a step forward.This step seemed to have alerted the zombie, as the quiet one-armed zombie turned its head to look at him.Without any words, the latter flung towards him.Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes were calm, he took a deep breath and bend his back slightly to meet him.The two figures collided with great force in the empty and dilapidated street.A touch and a split.One of the figures thumped back a few steps.Lu Sheng\u2019s expression was slightly strained.The fight with this one-armed zombie went for a long time. The felt a strong sense of danger emitting from it. But even so, when he was face to face with it, Lu Sheng still was at a disadvantage.\u201cIt\u2019s at least twice as strong as me \u2026\u201dLu Sheng did not panic. Countless accounts, experiences, and techniques tumbled up in his mind. He calmly threw punches, accurately and properly blocking each attack of the one-armed zombie.The one-armed zombie was faster and stronger than Lu Sheng, and did not understand fatigue or pain. But it had an equally glaring weakness.It was missing an arm, had no intelligence, and could only follow the combat instincts in its muscles to fight.This gave Lu Sheng the opportunity to defeat it head-on.Hoo-Lu Sheng moved nimbly to avoid the one-armed zombie\u2019s fist. Taking advantage of its momentary lapse, he found an opening in its defense. He clenched his fist and punched the one-armed zombie\u2019s forehead.His punch made a perfect arc. And in the process, the muscles on his arms seem to move as if they had gained a life of their own.Bam!!The one-armed zombie\u2019s head directly exploded.This punch was far more powerful than any of Lu Sheng\u2019s previous punches. A\u00a0lot\u00a0more powerful.The one-armed zombie fell down with a bang.Lu Sheng walked up to it, looked at its mutilated body, and chanted lowly.\u201cThe spirit is undying \u2026\u201dThe one-armed zombie\u2019s body quickly weathered, and its lifetime of experience and skill turned into a black smoke and beelined into Lu Sheng\u2019s body.Lu Sheng absorbed it without comment.Nowadays, he long ceased to regard these zombies as mere monsters that gave him \u201cexp\u201d but always attached some inexplicable feeling to each of them.Admiration, remembrance, or \u2026 even commitment.The first thing one needed to do was to get a bearing of what one was doing.\u201cLevel 5 Martial Artist, a powerhouse \u2026\u201dLu Sheng finished absorbing the memory of the one-armed zombie, and learned from the memory that the other party was a Level 5 Martial Artist when it was alive.And it was particularly good at hand combat, and with its experience as a Level 5 Martial Artists and its ideas and perception on the subject, it let Lu Sheng directly breakthrough the barrier and step into a new realm of hand combat and martial arts.\u201cNo wonder it had such strong punches. I wonder if I\u2019ve met the criterion for a Level 2 Martial Artist after my breakthrough \u2026\u201dLu Sheng had been practicing Stellar Body Refining Technique, Natural Breathing Technique and Crystal Contemplation Technique for almost a week, and had almost finished through his stock of Spiritual Muscle and Blood Strengthening Soup.He felt that his BQV had increased by a lot, but wasn\u2019t sure by how much exactly.\u201cEven if my BQV \u00a0does not meet the required standards for a Level 2 Martial Artist, my current CPI should more than make up for it.If I use the secret method I learned, together with the Natural Breathing Technique \u2026\u201dThe secret method Lu Sheng referred to was actually a power generation technique.A very high level power generation technique, recorded in the introductory chapter of the Stellar Body Refining Technique.This kind of power generation technique could allow a martial artist to explode with power several times, tens of times, or even hundreds of times beyond his normal state, and his combat power would directly skyrocket.However, this power generation technique requires a high level of physical fitness from the user, and Lu Sheng could only reach four times the power generation in his current stat.It was also very scary.It was equivalent to letting a Level 1 Martial Artist burst out with the power equivalent to that of a Level 2 Martial Artist, or even Level 3.This was simply unbelievable.This news, if spread, could directly blow up the entire WMA.Lu Sheng directly named this the Stellar Power Generation.\u2026Awakening from the dream state, Lu Sheng opened his eyes.His brain was alert, and he did not feel the slightest bit of fatigue at all.Lu Sheng had discovered this long ago.While he was cultivating and fighting in the Dream World, his brain and body both would rest in real time.This was akin to him having twice the time to cultivate compared to normal people, which could be considered as a unique advantage he was blessed with.After waking up, he continued with the Stellar Body Refining Technique, the Natural Breathing Technique, and practiced Crystal Contemplation for a while.After a week, Lu Sheng\u2019s progress in the Crystal Contemplation method was quite admirable, and he had almost succeeded in building a Crystal form in his mind, reaching the official introduction stage.A session later, Lu Sheng went to take a shower. After he was back he realized that no one was home.It was only 8 in the morning.Lu Sheng thought about it and decided to head out.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I last tested my BQV and CPI, I should test it today. If I meet the requirements, I should be able to clear the martial artist test with ease \u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 \u2014 BQV: 15+\u201cI\u2019d like to rent the testing apparatus, please.\u201dIt was the same old place, Red River Martial Arts Academy.The pretty receptionist stared at Lu Sheng\u2019s face for a while and smiled, \u201cBrother, you\u2019re here again? Is it that you\u2019re so concerned about your grades because of the coming examinations?\u201dThe pretty receptionist had recognized him.Am I that frequent?Lu Sheng froze for a moment and quickly reacted.Yes, this was the third he was coming here this month.He noticed that each time he came to test out his progress was when he\u2019d relatively made a good improvement in his skills and strength, but he also partly blamed the extreme speed with which he was growing.For a normal person, thrice a month was a lot. And he had measured it almost every week. While even in schools that cared most about a student\u2019s progress, they would only ask the student to undergo the test only once a month.Because the BQV was a dynamic value, the more frequent you measure it, the less accurate the value would be instead.Unless the person undergoing the testing was a martial arts genius whose BQV rose rapidly, there would only be a significant increase in numbers once every few days.\u201cOh, yeah \u2026\u201dLu Sheng had no explanations or reason had to give to the receptionist attempts at flirting, so he only indulged her with vague comments and perfunctory nods.Walking into the familiar testing room, Lu Sheng found a random instrument. It was just as well that there was no one in the room, making it convenient for him to fiddle with the apparatus.\u201cIt\u2019s better if I gauge my BQV first.\u201d This was the value he was more concerned about.Lu Sheng took a sample of his blood and placed it under the sampling container of the testing apparatus.Very quickly, with a soft sound of the machine, a value popped out.15.632\u201cThat big of an increase?\u201d Lu Sheng himself was startled.Thanks to his own thinking, he had come to a conclusion that his current level wasn\u2019t enough to reach a Level 2 Martial Artist, but the value turned out to be greater than that.If he thought about it, with the aid of martial cultivation of supreme martial artists, in addition to the most advanced tonics, 10,000 years into the future, it would be strange not to achieve such exaggerated results.\u201cNow for my CPI!\u201dA bright light flashed in Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes, and he aimed his fist fiercely at the strength measuring apparatus in front of him.\u201cLet me measure my relaxed state first!\u201dBoom \u2026With a muffled sound, a value popped up on the screen of the strength measuring instrument.3137!So high!Lu Sheng was shocked for a moment.Because he had absorbed a large amount of combat techniques and experience, his Combat Power Index had always exceeded the corresponding Blood-Qi Value standard.But this time, the margin was too large.It was twice as much as the standard!It was something that Lu Sheng did not expect at all.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because of the hand-combat technique \u2026\u201dLu Sheng thought for a while and quickly found a clue.His hand-combat skills, which had broken through once earlier, and he did not get to test it out after that. It was probably his fist techniques that had increased his power output, thus causing the value to soar.\u201cIn that case, my ultimate combat power should be much higher than I initially expected it to be!\u201dLu Sheng got a bit excited, and decided to measure it once more. This time, he decided to use the \u201cStellar Power Generation\u201d technique \u2026Five minutes later, Lu Sheng walked out of the testing room.He had a serene expression. One couldn\u2019t discern his mood.\u201cBrother, did you finish the test? Are satisfied with the results this time?\u201d The receptionist greeted him with a smile.Lu Sheng smiled faintly. His handsome face evoking a feeling a spring in the onlooker\u2019s mind.\u201cVery satisfied.\u201dThe receptionist winked playfully, \u201cThen I wish you good luck \u00a0for your examinations.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201dLu Sheng waved his hand and walked out of the martial arts academy in large strides.The receptionist looked at Lu Sheng\u2019s back as he left and muttered with a smile, \u201cBrat, acting cool, but he\u2019s pretty good-looking when he smiles \u2026\u201d\u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d A voice suddenly came out from behind the girl, startling her.The girl turned her head to look at the person who spoke and immediately stood up.\u201cSenior Sister Ni!\u201dNi Shuang stared at the direction Lu Sheng left, and a look of interest grew in her eyes. She had seen Lu Sheng when he had left the previous time, recognizing him as the poor genius who had managed to surprise her once before.\u201cDid that man come here for a test?\u201d\u201cYes. He\u2019s been here three times this month. I guess he\u2019s quite nervous about the upcoming examinations,\u201d the receptionist said a matter-of-fact.\u201cWhich machine did he use, take me to it,\u201d Ni Shuang said, casually.Ni Shuang had nothing to do, and she herself was a bit curious if whether this Lu Sheng had made any progress this time around.\u201cOkay, Senior Sister Ni.\u201dThe receptionist quickly led Ni Shuang to the apparatus that Lu Sheng had used.\u201cHe was the only one to use it, today. You should be able to find his date without much trouble.\u201d The receptionist said. She then took the initiative to retrieve his data.A few seconds later, Lu Sheng\u2019s results popped out. The two waiting for the numbers took a good look at the shown results.\u201cAh!\u201dThe receptionist let out a shriek, her pretty eyes widened in an instant, and one hand fiercely covered her mouth.Ni Shuang\u2019s went through even more drastic and steep changes. She was extremely shocked, with \u201cincredulous\u201d written all over her face. Her eyes showing thick and unmasked disbelief as if she did not trust her eyes.\u201cThis machine \u2026 is it broken?\u201d Ni Shuang spoke in a hoarse and difficult tone.The receptionist froze for several seconds before she reacted violently and blurted out, \u201cImpossible! We serviced it yesterday!\u201d\u201cThen that means \u2026\u201dNi Shuang took a deep breath, trying to calm the shock waves stirring her insides, and spoke with a bit of hesitation: \u201cThis score is the real one.\u201dThe receptionist nodded with a dull look on her face.Half a minute later, Ni Shuang\u2019s voice resounded from within the testing room and could almost be heard even in the lobby of the academy.\u201cFind the teenager who just underwent his test! Immediately! Go now! Everyone leave now! He often comes to our Red River Martial Academy, he must not live far away, there must be someone nearby who knows him! Go!\u201d\u201cYes! Senior Sister Ni!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 \u2014 Examination\u201cPlease go down to the Martial Arts Association, mister.\u201d Lu Sheng got into a cab and told his destination.The cab driver, a middle-aged man in his forties, glanced at Lu Sheng in the rearview mirror and smiled, \u201cYoung man, going to the Martial Arts Association for business, huh?\u201dJudging from Lu Sheng\u2019s age, he did not associate Lu Sheng with martial arts examinations.Lu Sheng also realized this and nodded with a smile, saying, \u201cYes, I\u2019m looking for someone.\u201dHearing Lu Sheng\u2019s answer, the cab driver immediately came to life and initiated a conversation at once.\u201cYoung man, looking at your age, you should be in senior inhigh school this year.\u201d\u201cMy daughter is also about the same age as you. She\u2019s also in the senior year \u2026 tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk \u2026\u201dThe cab driver was obviously a chatterbox, all the way from college entrance exams to college, and then from college to employment, he chattered about anything and everything, boring Lu Sheng to death.The key was that Lu Sheng also had choice but to respond bashfully here and there. Throughout the conversation he just responded with \u201cum\u201d, \u201cright\u201d, \u201cmaster you are right\u201d just to keep the conversation going.On the surface, Lu Sheng had on a very serious look, showing the driver that he was paying attention, but he was wallowing in regret on the inside.I should\u2019ve told him I was going to the Martial Artists Association to take my Level 2 Martial Arts certification test. This way, he\u2019d definitely think I am sick in the head and not want to talk to me.When he finally arrived at his destination, Lu Sheng paid the fare and hurriedly got out, breathing a long sigh of relief.The cab driver poked his head out of the cab and enthusiastically said goodbye to Lu Sheng.\u201cYoung man, it was a pleasure talking to you. If we have the chance to meet again, I\u2019ll introduce you to my daughter \u2026\u201dLu Sheng smiled politely and nodded, silently thinking:\u00a0I hope there won\u2019t be a next time.Turning around, he saw the Martial Artist Association.It was a grand building with the signboard of \u201cBaihe City Martial Arts Association\u201d at the entrance.Lu Sheng calmly walked inside.The lobby to the MAA was not very crowded, and it can be seen that not many people usually have the opportunity to come here.[MAA: Martial Arts Association]Lu Sheng followed the notice posted on the wall and found the window responsible for martial artist certification and proceeded.\u201cAre you here to take the Level 1 Martial Artist certification test?\u201d The staff at the window studied Lu Sheng\u2019s ID card and gave him an extra long look.Lu Sheng nodded his head.It was reasonable to say that his current strength could already apply for Level 2, but Lu Sheng turned around and couldn\u2019t find the window for the Level 2 Martial Artist certification.\u201cFill out the form, 1000 yuan for the assessment, then go over there \u2026\u201dThe staff at the counter was patient and careful while instructing Lu Sheng what to do.After all, Lu Sheng was here to participate in the certification test, whether he could pass was not of concern, but the fact that he was here meant that he had a certain level of confidence in his own strength.Taking in consideration Lu Sheng\u2019s age, perhaps he was a small-time genius. A bit of politeness hurt no one.Lu Sheng filled out the required form, paid the fee, and followed the staff\u2019s guidance and entered the room labeled \u201cMartial Artist Assessment Room\u201d.Walking in, he saw three or four people sitting inside, and an examiner in overalls. He swept his eyes at Lu Sheng and said, \u201cGive me the form and find a seat a seat for yourself.\u201dLu Sheng handed his form and found a seat in the corner for himself.After Lu Sheng came in, a few others also joined him here.One of them had a centipede like long scar on his face, there was also a fierce-looking man, and an innocent-looking girl with purple hairband.Lu Sheng took a look at the girl with the purple hairband and felt that the other party was about the same age as hims.It so happened that the girl was also looking at him, and the two eyes crossed slightly before they each withdrew.The examinees in the room checked each other out. Many gave Lu Sheng curious glances as well.The reason being that out of all the other examinees he and the girl were the youngest.\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll start. \u201dThe examiner saw that the room was filled up and announced the commencement of the examination.\u201cFirst, Li Xingji, Level 1 Martial Artist Assessment.\u201dA tall and thin young man stood up from his seat and walked to the testing apparatus in the middle of the room.\u201cThis is how the test\u2019ll be. First you measure your BQV, then the CPI. You\u2019ll get 3 chances to measure your CPI if you miss a try due to nervousness or any other reason.\u201d The examiner explained.The tall, thin youth nodded, \u201cUnderstood.\u201dImmediately after that, he started the test.It could be seen that as the first person in the room to take the test, the youth was a little nervous.He failed to insert the needle to collect his blood. Only after several tries did he get it right.But in the end, he passed.BQV: 1.531.Unfortunately, the youth did not meet the standard for three times in a row for the CPI.In fact, he was off just by a bit. Lu Sheng did not know if was nervous or just lacked the strength, but in all three tries, he score hovered around the 140s.\u201cFail.\u201d\u201cHow can it be? How can it be \u2026\u201d The lanky youth was shaken, his face was pale as if he had lost his soul. He kept on chanting, \u201cHow could it be? I obviously exceeded 150 every time when I tested my CPI at home \u2026\u201dThe examiner, seeing his appearance, spoke up: \u201cThe Martial Arts Association\u2019s instruments are officially customized, and are more accurate and rigorous than those sold outside \u2026You do have the strength, so go back and settle down for another month. You should be able to clear it in your next attempt.\u201dThe tall, lanky youth nodded, pursed his lips and quickly walked out of the room.Emotions and such were contagious. After observing the result of the first candidate, the rest all put on stern expressions to hide their nervousness. Though that did not help them much.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 \u2014 Blowing up!\u201cZhao Changfeng!\u201d The examiner read out a name.A sturdy figure slowly stood up, it was the fierce looking man with a scar on his face.\u201cDid he not come later? Why is he the second one up?\u201d Someone shouted in disbelief.The examiner looked at the person coldly and spoke, \u201cBecause I only saw his application form right now, he was supposed to go first \u00a0\u2026\u201dThe people in the room froze, not understanding what the examiner meant by this statement.Then they heard the examiner read out the rest of the words.Then they heard the examiner read out the details for the test, \u201cLevel 3 Martial Artist Assessment.\u201dHiss!A sound of people sucking in cold air resounded in the room.Everyone looked at the scarred man with a shocked face and a hint of awe in their eyes.Level 3 Martial Artist Assessment.In other words, this man possessed the strength of a Level 2 and was close to a Level 3 Martial Artist. No wonder the examiner said that he should have been the first to undergo the assessment.In the world of martial artists, strength is paramount, and the strong deserve to enjoy their respective privileges.The scarred man walked silently to the testing apparatus, he took his blood, and tested.A number quickly popped up on the BQV apparatus.107.256The people in the room looked astonished. A BQV of over 100 meant that the scarred man had met the standard of a Level 3 Martial Artist in the blood and Qi category.Then came the Combat Power Index.The scarred man faced the testing machine and threw a punch.The speed of this punch was so fast that many people didn\u2019t see it clearly, they only felt a blur in front of their eyes, and it ended with a muffled sound in their ears.Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes flickered for a moment. He saw the man\u2019s punch clearly.The stance and the way the punch was thrown looked like it came from some kind of fist or hand-combat technique.10831!A value popped up on the gauge.The stifled with sounds of shock and disbelief.It\u2019s over!The Combat Power Index had exceeded the standard for a Level 3 Martial Artist.This also meant that from now on, the scarred man was an official Level 3 Martial Artist who was recognized by the Martial Arts Association.The way everyone looked at the scarred man changed a bit at this point.Admiration, but also with a hint of envy.Only a handful of people in the entire Baihe city could be counted among the ranks of Level 3 Martial Artists.Wherever they went, they would be treated very well.\u201cCongratulations, Zhao Changfeng. From now on, you are a Level 3 Martial Artist recognized by our Baihe City\u2019s Martial Arts Association, and you can enjoy a martial cultivation allowance of 30,000 yuan every month from now on \u2026\u201dA bright smile appeared on the examiner\u2019s face for the first time, and as he recounted, the people in the room looked at the scarred man with more and more envy.The scarred man silently listened to the examiner\u2019s words, then walked back to his original position and sat down.Lu Sheng gave the other party a bit of a strange look.This guy did not leave after the examination, he looked like he wanted to spectate the rest of the assessments.Of course, no one would have a problem with this.If he was fine with it, it wouldn\u2019t matter if a Level 3 Martial Artist wanted to sit here until it went completely dark.The next few people went up, all of them cleared the assessment and were now Level 1 Martial Artists.Some passed, and some failed like the lanky youth.Finally \u2026\u201cLu Sheng, Level 1 Martial Artist Assessment.\u201dIt was Lu Sheng\u2019s turn.Lu Sheng calmly stood up, he noticed that the eyes of everyone in the room were focused on him. The scarred man and the girl with the purple hairband also looked at him.Even the examiner looked at him a couple of times.After all, not many examinees were of Lu Sheng\u2019s age, which in itself represented talent.\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, just do what you usually do.\u201dThe examiner spoke gently in a rare moment.Lu Sheng nodded, then picked up the needle to sample his blood.The crimson blood gently rolled down in the groove of the apparatus and blue light fell.Everyone looked at the display on the instrument.Some serious, some casual.The next moment, the value was displayed.15.701Boom!The whole room instantly exploded.More than half of the people jumped straight up from their positions, and the scarred man and the girl with the purple hairband also stood up as a show of agitation.One of the guys with a casual face even slid straight to the floor on his butt.\u201cCrap! Really, I\u2019m not mistaken, right? 15 points?\u201d\u201cLevel 2 Martial Artist?!\u201d\u201cThe machine is broken, right? I think it\u2019s broken \u2026\u201dEveryone stared at the value on the apparatus with disbelief, their eyes sliding back and forth between the gauge and Lu Sheng\u2019s body.Even the examiner\u2019s hand holding the form shook fiercely for a moment, then he quickly checked the machine.Then in an incomparably serious tone he said to Lu Sheng: \u201cThis student, could you take a retest?\u201dIt was reasonable to argue that there was only a single chance to test one\u2019s BQV during an assessment, but the result Lu Sheng displayed was so amazing that the examiner had to confirm it again.Lu Sheng nodded his head, picked up the blood extraction needle and retrieved a drop of blood to conduct the test.15.693It was almost the same as the first time, fluctuating up and down by no more than 0.01.This proved that the instrument was normal, and also proves that \u2026 Lu Sheng\u2019s result\u2019s bona fide!The room fell into an inexplicable silence.After that, the sound of labored breathing resounded one after another.The look in people\u2019s eyes changed when they looked at Lu Sheng. It was as if they were looking at a monster.\u201cHis dad must be the richest man in Baihe City, right? How tonic pills did he gobble down to get this result?\u201d A person in the room said. His face was full of complicated emotions.Others also had similar expressions on their faces. Like they were constipated.Lu Sheng was simply too young. At a glance, he looked like he belonged in high school.How old can a high school student be?17? 18? Similar in age to their brothers, nephews, or even sons. Yet, his BQV was as high as an outrageous 15 points!\u201cThis guy must\u2019ve been taking tonic pills from the time he was in his mother\u2019s womb, right?\u201d Someone spoke sourly.A person next to him muttered: \u201cEven if he has a high BQV, as long as his CPI measures up to the 15 points \u2026 tsk, tsk, tsk. An 18-year-old, Level 2 Martial Artist \u2026\u201d The others stopped talking.The actual fact was that even if Lu Sheng really a pill junkie, with a BQV of 15.7 his CPI wouldn\u2019t that far from or worse. In other words, Lu Sheng had basically passed the assessment with flying colors.It was very likely that he\u2019d clear the Level 2 Martial Artist Assessment.A high school student becoming a Level 2 Martial Artist at his age.These people almost groaned out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 \u2014 Exaggerated Combat Power Index! Etiquette of the StrongThe scarred man and the purple hairband girl also had incomparably complicated expressions.Both of them were considered calm among everyone, but the shock in their faces and eyes still couldn\u2019t be hidden.At this point the examiner\u2019s attitude towards Lu Sheng once again went up a notch.It became incomparably gentle.\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, just relax. The CPI test can be done as many times as you want, hit the one you are most satisfied with \u2026\u201dThe others listened with a twitch in their faces.Twitch.Did he not say that each person can only try out thrice? What does he mean by \u201cas many times as you want\u201d?!Lu Sheng took a deep breath and said to the examiner, \u201cNo, one will be more than enough.\u201dThe examiner was flabbergasted and had yet to give out any reaction.Then he saw the action of Lu Sheng\u2019s fist. The others too saw the initial posture Lu Sheng took.Only the scarred man had a change go through him when he looked at Lu Sheng; a fierce burst of astonishment shone in his eyes. He subconsciously took two steps forward.Boom!A dull and loud sound, louder than the sound made by the scarred man during the test just now.Everybody\u2019s heart jumped at the sound. They eagerly looked towards the gauge, waiting for the result to be displayed.However, the eagerness only lasted a moment. Just a moment.Then they froze in their spots.Their mouths were wide open, their eyes were dull, and their expressions were as if they had just seen a ghost.\u201c1 \u2026 1 \u2026 1 \u2026\u201dThe examiner\u2019s expression was dull as he tried to announce the result.He soon realized that he was repeating the number 1. He quickly shut up and then quickly read it again.\u201c15,709!\u201dFive digits!CPI of over 10,000!Over 15,700, close to 16,000!Far beyond the standard CPI of a Level 2 Martial Artist, and single-handedly beating the previous full-fledged Level 3 Martial Artist\u2019s\u2014the scar face martial artist\u2014previous result by a full 5000 points!The room was deathly silent.All of them stood up, and went still.The scarred man\u2019s bony palms were fiercely clenched into fists, and his eyes were wide with disbelief.The girl with the purple hairband had one hand over her mouth, afraid she would scream.Others were even brain buzzed. They seemed to have lacked oxygen, making them lose the ability to think.When something was too beyond their knowledge and understanding, the human brain would temporarily, as a protection mechanism, put them in a state similar to death. Many a people found themselves in this state.Lu Sheng was not surprised by this result.He had already measured his CPI once earlier at the Red River Martial Arts Academy. However, his previous result had been a bit lower than 15,600. Making the current score his highest yet.\u201cAfter breaking through in my fist and hand combat skills, together with Stellar Power Generation and Natural Breathing Technique, my CPI had directly increased 10x the standard BQV. Is this fruit of my martial arts technique \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng sighed in his heart.After admiring his achievement, Lu Sheng turned his head to look at the examiner.\u201cThat\u2019s fine, you don\u2019t need to demonstrate it again.\u201dThe examiner woke up from the dream-like state, subconsciously nodded his head, and then read out his usual lines.\u201cCongratulations, student Lu Sheng, you have successfully passed the Level 1 Martial Artist Assessment. Henceforth, you\u2019ll be a \u2026 you\u2019ll be \u2026 you\u2019ll be \u2026\u201dThe examiner couldn\u2019t continue reading halfway through.The reason being that he was unsure how many levels he should clear him for.Lu Sheng had declared\u2014indirectly through his application\u2014that he was a Level 1 Martial Artist, but his real strength was far beyond Level 1 or even a few Level 2 Martial Artists.His CPI was at an exaggerated Level 3 standard.How should he be graded?Level 1, 2, or 3?The examiner had an anguished expression.This kind of situation, if not handled well, will probably cause Lu Sheng\u2019s discontent.If he did not handle the situation well, it would end in Lu Sheng\u2019s discontent. And to offend such a promising genius martial artist, that was just like him saying goodbye to his job.Thinking of this, the examiner ran to Lu Sheng and said: \u201cAbout your grading, I need to report it first. Don\u2019t worry, Lu Sheng, the Martial Arts Association won\u2019t bury any talents \u2026 oh no, a genius. Especially a genius like you.\u201dLu Sheng was a bit stunned, but soon accepted the result. It meant that he\u2019d have to head back and wait for the official announcement.\u201c\u2026 Then I\u2019ll get back, first \u2026\u201dLu Sheng still had questions he wanted to ask him, but the examiner had already run out of the assessment room. Leaving behind the rest of the examinees who had yet to undergo their individual assessments.Lu Sheng was helpless. He could only shake his head as he prepared to leave. But, when he reached the door, a figure suddenly jumped in front of him, blocking his way.It was the man with a scar on his face.\u201cZhao Changfeng! \u201dThe man extended a hand to him, his gaze burning.Lu Sheng hesitated for a moment, then extended his hand to shake the extended hand.\u201cLu Sheng.\u201dAfter Lu Sheng said his name, a trace of suppressed excitement flashed through the scarred man\u2019s eyes, as if he had received some kind of glory. He nodded his head and took the initiative to make a way for Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng pondered.Is this a gesture of goodwill?Or was it a friendship?He did not know much about the rules between martial artists, but he subconsciously associated with a point of knowledge that he read in history books.In the ancient martial arts era, every martial artist saw it as an honor to befriend a more powerful martial artist.Was this what Zhao Changfeng meant?\u201cWang Dafeng \u2026\u201d From the side, Lu Sheng noticed another person running towards him with his hand outstretched, seemingly following Zhao Changfeng\u2019s example. Yet, behind him the rest of the occupants of the room also charged, with their hands outstretched, following the trend.He hurriedly fled out of the assessment room, almost flying out of there.This etiquette was amusing if it was just one person who followed and observed it, but it was no longer funny if too many people did it.Moreover, the rest were more like a bunch of cats and dogs than respectable martial artists.Looking at Lu Sheng\u2019s running figure, many showed a look of remorse and regret, slapping their thighs in frustration.Like Lu Sheng, a genius with such a terrifying talent.Lu Sheng, a genius with terrifying talent. Even a person with butt for a head would know that he was someone whose name would surely resound in Baihe City. And they had missed an opportunity to get to know such a\u2014future\u2014influential figure for nothing.Their intestines churned with regret.Some people couldn\u2019t help cast remorseful glances at Zhao Changfeng. They were secretly jealous of how he had jumped at the opportunity.Zhao Changfeng\u2019s fierce face regained its former calm. The hidden joy in them was for all to see.They sighed once more.He is worthy of being a Level 3 Martial Artist! His brain is so quick on the uptake!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 \u2013 I Saw Your Brother Walk Out of the Assessment RoomLu Sheng went around the Martial Association and felt that there was really nothing more to do, so he was ready to go home.Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly heard someone call out to him from behind.\u201cLu Sheng!\u201dLu Sheng turned his head and saw three girls standing playfully not far away.The three girls were about the same age, all a little younger than him, and the one standing in the middle looked at him with a complicated expression on her face.Who would it be if not his sister, Lu Qinghe.\u201cLu Qinghe? Why are you here?\u201d Lu Sheng walked over towards the three girls.\u201cI should be the one asking you this question.\u201dLu Qinghe retorted in a good-natured manner, \u201cSkipping classes, sleeping in your room every day, and now what are you doing here in the Martial Arts Association?\u201dLu Qinghe regarded Lu Sheng with a very investigative look.Lu Sheng was slightly embarrassed. Even if he skipped school, even if he spent most of his time in his room sleeping, how did Lu Qinghe know about it?It looked like his sister was paying him much attention lately.Lu Sheng replied casually: \u201cI had something to do around here. Now that it\u2019s done, I\u2019m leaving.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019ll believe that?\u201d Lu Qinghe scoffed.At the same time, an oval-faced girl wearing a pink hairpin, next to Lu Qinghe glanced at Lu Sheng, and said: \u201cQinghe, is this your brother? Quite handsome \u2026\u201dThe girl blushed and kept her eyes on him.Another girl with a slimmer figure also agreed: \u201cYes, he isn\u2019t as frustrating as you usually paint him as. He is obviously your older brother \u2026 a\u00a0very good\u00a0old brother \u2026\u201d\u201cYou two \u2026\u201dLu Qinghe looked at her two girlfriends who betrayed her one after another and fumed almost to the point of being speechless.Seeing Lu Qinghe deflate, Lu Sheng took the initiative to introduce himself: \u201cHello, I\u2019m Lu Sheng, Lu Qinghe\u2019s older brother. Qinghe seemed to cause you a lot of trouble all the time.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the one causing trouble \u2026\u201d Lu Qinghe became angry and retorted.The two little girls were very nice to talk to, and the slim one nodded her head with a smile.\u201cHello Brother Lu Sheng, my name is Feng Fanfan, my friends call me Fan Fan. This is Xu Nuo. It\u2019s true that Qinghe keeps causing trouble, but we\u2019re good friends, it\u2019s only right that we take care of her.\u201d\u201cFeng Fanfan!\u201d Lu Qinghe had a shocked, mad expression.It\u2019s really just an excuse to take advantage of the situation.It was just an excuse to take advantage of the situation.What do you mean by \u201ccausing trouble\u201d? Who is the one who looks after you at school?The most crucial point was that even if she did keep causing trouble they did not have to spill it out all in front of her most hated brother.Lu Sheng smilingly greeted the two girls.After chatting for a few minutes, the conversation came back to the initial topic.\u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\u201d Lu Qinghe handed him a blank stare, obviously unwilling to answer.It was the girl named Xu Nuo who quickly explained, \u201cWe are here to accompany Senior Sister Yang Yuan, who is our senior in the martial arts club. We are very close to her \u2026\u201d\u201cYes. Senior Sister Yang Yuan is very powerful. She is ranked among the top three geniuses in our school. She is here to participate in the Level 1 Martial Artist Certification Test.\u201d\u201cSister Yang Yuan will definitely pass.\u201d The two girls chimed.After Lu Sheng had a better understanding of the situation, he looked at the time, and said, \u201cSince you guys are waiting for someone, I won\u2019t get in your way. I\u2019ll treat you to dinner the next time we meet.\u201d\u201cOkay Brother Lu Sheng.\u201d\u201cWho wants your dinner \u2026\u201dThe two cheerful voices were interspersed with Lu Qinghe\u2019s impotent mendacious comments.Lu Sheng smiled faintly and stretched out his hand to rub on Lu Qinghe\u2019s head, causing Lu Qinghe\u2019s face to blush and have an urge to hit him. But before she could react he was gone.\u2026\u201cI\u2019m so pissed off!\u201dLu Qinghe tidied her hair that had been ruffled by Lu Sheng and said with a huff. But a strange ripple rose in her heart.She vaguely remembered the time when she was small, Lu Sheng would often ruffle her hair like this; they shared a pretty good relationship.Later, she did not when, the relationship started to fade \u2026But just now, his simple action dug those memories from the past.\u201cQinghe, your brother\u2019s so damn good-looking, ah. So tall, fair, and handsome, not delicate, but very sunny \u2026\u201dFeng Fanfan looked at the direction Lu Sheng left, smacked her lips and sighed, as if she was still reminiscing the moment.\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201dNext to Xu Nuo also nodded frantically and echoed, \u201cHe\u2019s simply a male god!\u201d\u201cYou two are blind \u2026\u201d Lu Qinghe felt powerless.\u201cOh right \u2026\u201dFeng Fanfan suddenly remembered something and spoke: \u201cWhat exactly do you think your brother is doing here at the Martial Arts Association? I just saw him walk out of the assessment room \u2026\u201d\u201cYour brother wouldn\u2019t have come to take the Martial Artist Certification test, like Senior Sister Yang Yu\u2014\u201d\u201cHow is that possible!\u201d Xu Nuo interjected.Lu Qinghe looked at two as if they were sick in their heads and were without cure, said: My brother is a student of Baihe Third High School, and isn\u2019t regular to classes, how can he participate in the certification test? If that was possible even pigs will start climbing trees. It\u2019s simply impossible!\u201dFeng Fanfan muttered, \u201cBut I did just see your brother walk out of the assessment room \u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because you saw wrong.\u201dLu Qinghe\u2019s tone was incomparably certain.Feng Fanfan still wanted to say something, at this time, Xu Nuo looked at a direction and shouted in surprise: \u201cSenior Sister Yang Yuan has come out!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34 \u2013 What is the Name of That Monster?Lu Qinghe\u2019s trio quickly greeted a tall, pretty-looking girl with a purple hairband on her hair.\u201cSister Yang Yuan, how was it? Is it over?\u201dAs soon as they met, Lu Qinghe couldn\u2019t wait to ask, her pretty little face full of expectation.Yang Yuan was the person Lu Qinghe admired the most in school, there was no one else who could compare to her.The top genius of Baihe First Middle School, the demon whose BQV and CPI reached the stand of a Level 1 Martial Artist at the age of 18, the strongest woman of the martial arts club \u2026Numerous halos, titles, and other achievements surrounded this senior sister in front of them.Feng Fanfan and Xu Nuo\u2019s faces were also full of expectation and a hint of nervousness.From the looks of it, Yang Yuan\u2019s results seemed more important to them than their own affairs.Yang Yuan\u2019s expression, however, was somewhat strange.It was a kind of unspeakable complexity.\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, there was an accident, the examination was suspended, I guess we have to wait for the afternoon schedule.\u201d Yang Yuan shook her head.\u201cAh?\u201dThe Lu Qinghe trio were a bit surprised, and quickly asked: \u201cWhat accident? What kind of accident can suspend the examination?Yang Yuan said with a bitter smile: \u201cA monster, demon. He scared the examiner into fleeing. Without him the examinations cannot be proceeded.\u201d\u201cWhat monster \u2026? Demon \u2026 \u201dThe Lu Qinghe trio listened to her with rapt attention.Yang Yuan sighed, her eyes a stir of complex emotions, saying: \u201cIn fact, the boy about the same age as me, or maybe a bit younger than me, I don\u2019t know. During the test his measured BQV was 15.7, and more shocking was his CPI, which was around 15,700 \u2026 Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s scary? I always took myself as a bit of genius, now thanks to that guy I see the truth.\u201dYang Yuan sighed, and continued: \u201c\u2026 I know what a real genius is like now.\u201dAfter hearing Yang Yuan\u2019s words, the Lu Qinghe trio\u2019s small mouths opened wide, eyes rounded, as if they were all stuck.They were so shocked that they didn\u2019t know what expression to use.About the same age as Senior Sister Yang Yuan. BQV of 15.7 \u2026 CPI of 15,700 \u2026 Is there really such a thing in the world? Or rather, can such a person be really considered human?They now finally knew why the examination was suspended.If such a monster emerged from the examination, it is estimated that the whole Martial Arts Association will be in a state of sensation, and it will be on the morning news tomorrow!\u201cSister Yang \u2026\u201dFeng Fanfan suddenly reacted and asked curiously, \u201cWhat is this person\u2019s name? Do you know?\u201dLu Qinghe and Xu Nuo immediately perked up their ears and stared closely at Yang Yuan.Yang nodded and opened her mouth to say it.\u201cLu Sheng! His name is Lu Sheng. That said, I had a chance to meet him just now, but I was so shocked that I was too slow in reacting and missed the opportunity to introduce myself to him. Heh \u2026 I don\u2019t know If I\u2019ll ever meet him again \u2026\u201dYang Yuan sighed, with a face filled with regret and lamentation.As she spoke, she suddenly realized that something was wrong.When she looked up, she saw that the expressions on the Lu Qinghe trio had become incredibly strange.Especially Lu Qinghe, her whole person seemed utterly flabbergasted.Yang Yuan blinked, feeling amazed, and was about to ask.Suddenly, she heard a sentence floating weakly out of Xu Nuo\u2019s mouth.\u201cQinghe, your brother\u2019s name is Lu Sheng, right? And he just walked out of the assessment room \u2026\u201dThis time, it was Yang Yuan\u2019s turn to freeze.\u2026Lu Sheng walked all the way back home. On the way back, he felt a bit hungry and incidentally bought home a dozen or so meat buns. He went while munching on a few of them.Almost to the entrance of the community, Lu Sheng saw a group of people hurriedly running ahead in front of him.Lu Sheng felt the uniform they wore to be a bit familiar, then he recalled seeing them in the Red River Martial Arts Academy.A few residents stood at the entrance of the community looking at the hustle-bustle while discussing by themselves.\u201cWho are these people?\u201d\u201cThe Red River Martial Arts Academy. I heard they are looking for someone. They\u2019ve already searched several neighborhoods already. They went door-to-door \u2026\u201d\u201cWho dare mess with the Red River Martial Arts Academy? Ah, they really are unlucky. This situation, I\u2019m afraid, won\u2019t be resolved with just a few broken legs \u2026\u201d\u201cYes, these martial artists seem pretty fierce \u2026\u201dLu Sheng listened to the general gossip going around, but did not pay the situation much attention.He only knew of the Red River Martial Arts Academy loosely, and had been there only a couple of times. If the academy was looking for revenge, they simply were. It had nothing to do with him.Lu Sheng finished his last bun when he paced back into his house.Lu Sheng had a rare opportunity to just relax, so he sat on the sofa and just rested for a while.Suddenly, his phone began ringing. Lu Sheng picked it up and looked at caller ID and saw that it was the guy from Xingshan Tang and cut the call.Although the Spirit Muscle and Blood Strengthening Soup was almost finished, he was not worried.The other side had been trying to get in touch with him with increasing urgency and fervency. The guy must need him for something. As for what, Lu Sheng had an idea. He guessed that it must be related to the Spirit Muscle and Blood Strengthening Soup.He remembered that he had left in a hurry and left the flask unwashed. Furthermore, he estimated that the other party must\u2019ve analyzed the residue and had found something interesting and was eager to contact him.When that Spirit Muscle and Blood Strengthening Soup was to come to fruition, he had already had an idea in his mind.His martial arts cultivation required a lot of money to support it, and as his strength increased he would need more and more.How this money would come, naturally, he had to rely on those prescriptions in his head.Without bragging, Lu Sheng casually took a pair of futuristic medicine prescriptions out and could easily exchange them for a large amount of wealth.But the how, when, and whom matter most. All aspects must be deliberated.All aspects need to be deliberate.Xingshan Tang did not qualify, but with or without the prescriptions, he still needed to consider a lot before coming to a decision.As of now, Lu Sheng desperately wanted to verify a conjecture he had in mind; an idea.This matter was very crucial and was directly related to his subsequent martial part and how he\u2019d proceed in the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Failed to qualify as a Level 7 Master in the same year. ].[ He died on July, 383, at the age of 87 in an attack from the foreign beats on Baihe city. ].[ Lu Sheng was married and had 2 daughters and 1 son. ].[ Available Authority: Level 2 ].After this point, Lu Sheng\u2019s life history became much richer, and Lu Sheng read through it carefully. Finishing it, he found that his character rating underneath had increased by half a star, becoming two and half stars.Of course, the authority was still only Level 2.\u201cSure enough, the future can be changed, or at least, my future can be changed!\u201cA week ago, I was a Level 4 Martial Artist who died at the age of 37, and a week later I successfully managed to be in my 80s. My strength hit the roof at Level 6, and If I hadn\u2019t met with an accident, I might\u2019ve lived even longer \u2026\u201cThe difference between the two lives lies in my strength that has improved within the week! My strength changed, the college entrance exams results changed, university changed, and my end was also changed.\u201cEarlier, it was shown that I had graduated from Baihe Martial Arts University and chose to join military. Now I\u2019ve graduated from Dongning Martial Arts University and chose to open my own martial arts school, and finally had even touched the threshold for Level 7 Master \u2026\u201cEffort is of prime importance. The saying \u201cChoice determines fate\u201d really does make sense now \u2026\u201dIn addition, Lu Sheng found one more thing.\u201cThis biography doesn\u2019t mention any information related to Stellar Body Refining Technique, Natural Breathing Technique or the Crystal Contemplation Method, it seems that the techniques I obtained in the Dream World will not have any effect on the subsequent life as long as I don\u2019t choose to expose them \u2026\u201dClosing the interface of the Optical Mind, a determined look appeared in Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes.\u201cThrough this verification I can be sure that my idea is valid. Fate can be changed, indeed. But to truly change the fate of the human race, and shift the trajectory of the entire world for the next 10,000 years \u2026 the strength I have now is far from enough to achieve that.\u201cLevel 6 Past Master is insignificant, but Level 7 Master, Level 8 Grandmaster, or even a Level 9 Martial Sage is just too unreachable. Perhaps when I reach the peak of Level 10, or even Level 11 in this era \u2026 only then will I have the slightest possibility of saving what needs to be saved.\u201dEven in the future\u201410,000 years later\u2014the Level 11 martial powerhouses were a rare sight, let alone in the current age with only a martial cultivation history of just over 300 years.The path that Lu Sheng chose was simply impossibly difficult. However, he was resolved to give it his best.\u2026Baihe city, Martial Artists Association.Chairman\u2019s office.The fifty-nine-year-old Xiao Yuhe had black hair and a rosy complexion, and there were hardly any wrinkles on his face, so he could not be seen as an old man who would be a sexagenarian soon.But for a peak Level 6 Martial Artist who was about to enter the realm of a Level 7 Master, this was not surprising.Xiao Yuhe was writing the character \u201cGod\u201d with a brush, and he was concentrating on it.Xiao Yuhe once met with an old master, who said that he had accumulated enough in all other aspects, but only his spiritual cultivation was falling short.As long as he wrote 100,000 \u201cGod\u201d characters, it was possible for him to reach the realm of a Master.[TN: \u795e\u00a0sh\u00e9n].So far, Xiao Yuhe had already written 46,721, and this was the 46,722nd character.\u201cChairman!\u201dThe door was suddenly opened, and a man dashed in.Xiao Yuhe\u2019s hand shook and a bit of ink fell on the paper, and the half-written character was ruined.Xiao Yuhe glanced at the character with some regret, casually put down the pen, picked up the towel at hand and wiped his hands, and spoke, \u201cWhat is it? What caused you to be so in a panic that you even forget how to knock before you enter.\u201dThe person who came in was Xiao Yuhe\u2019s secretary. She was in her 30s, wearing a pair of glasses, she looked svelte.\u201cSorry President, I\u2019ll make sure to pay attention next time \u2026\u201d The secretary apologized embarrassed, and then her expression became serious.\u201cThere is something important to report.\u201d\u201cSpeak.\u201dThe secretary picked up the document in her hands and reported the matter briefly.Xiao Yuhe\u2019s face was calm at first, and gradually his expression began to change when they were at the meat of the report. His hand that picked up the cup shook fiercely, hot tea spilling on the table.\u201cBring the data here. Quick!\u201dXiao Yuhe couldn\u2019t care less about clearing the table and urged quickly. The secretary hurriedly handed up the documents in her hands.Xiao Yuhe took the document and carefully flipped through it.Soon, his eyes began to gradually widen, and there were small involuntary twitches of muscles at the corners of his eyes and mouth.In the end, a huge splash of surprise bloomed out from his face.\u201cYes! Bravo!\u201dXiao Yuhe fiercely stood up and blurted out with an excited expression, \u201cI never thought that our Baihe City could produce such a genius \u2026\u201dAfter a short bout of excitement, Xiao Yuhe\u2019s emotions gradually calmed down.He lowered his head for a moment and calmly spoke, \u201cBring me up the video of this student\u2019s assessment, I\u2019ll watch it at once.\u201d\u201cAs you wish.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 \u2014 Perfection Realm Fist Technique, Gifted Martial Artist!Soon, an up-to-date laptop was placed on Xiao Yuhe\u2019s desk, and the assessment began to play on the screen. Xiao Yuhe found the youngster named Lu Sheng with a glance.In the picture, Lu Sheng, with an upright posture and handsome appearance, gave a calm and confident feeling when he moved his hands and feet.Xiao Yuhe\u2019s eyes lit up, and he couldn\u2019t help but open his mouth to praise: \u201cThe young man is calm and steady, with the style of a great general \u2026\u201dThe secretary next to him hurriedly echoed and nodded her head.Afterwards, the video moved to the scene where Lu Sheng began taking his BQV test.Xiao Yuhe already knew the results from the data, but when he really saw the \u201c15.701\u201d value appear in front of his eyes, his expression still could not help but slightly shaken.The main thing was that this Lu Sheng was still too young.According to the data, this young man named Lu Sheng, was 17 years and a month old. He had just become a senior in high school not long ago.He had such high BQV at his age \u2026 The implication and impact were simply too great.One must know that most high schoolers would at most have BQV of about 1, which was not bad.When Baihe city had conducted a census of high school, the average BQV they found was only around 0.783.Lu Sheng was twenty times higher than the average.Even in the best high school in Baihe city, Baihe First High School, the most outstanding geniuses there, how much would\u2019ve been their BQV?No more than 2.0.\u201cPresident, do you think this Lu Sheng has taken a lot of tonic pills to get this result? \u2026\u201dThe secretary interjected at the side.Xiao Yuhe shook his head, \u201cImpossible. You understand Lu Sheng\u2019s family conditions. His parents are ordinary people. They simply cannot afford to buy many tonic pills \u2026\u201dThe secretary thought for a moment and said, \u201cWhat if someone else financed it?\u201dXiao Yuhe gave the secretary a look.\u201cConsidering his age, do you know how many tonic pills he would need to take to make his BQV reach 15.7?\u201dXiao Yuhe held out a finger and answered, \u201cLet me give you an example. It would bankrupt a a family with over a billion yuan in assets, and yet that too would not necessarily be enough \u2026 Moreover, even if an ordinary person does ingest that many pills, it is no guarantee that it\u2019ll increase his BQV and make it reach that height. A genius cannot be buried with money!\u201dHowever, Xiao Yuhe had yet to mention the most crucial point. As a peak Level 6 Martial Artist he knew how vain it was to raise one\u2019s BQV with the help of pills. And the strength brought by it would be like an empty glass.But this Lu Sheng was solid and steady like no other.Then again, Lu Sheng\u2019s Combat Power Index results later were a perfect testament to his genuine strength.Boom!A muffled sound came from the screen, that was the sound of Lu Sheng throwing a punch.\u201c15,700 plus \u2026\u201dThe secretary sighed almost groaning, \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t personally responsible for the maintenance of the association\u2019s instruments every week, I would have suspected that this was an instrument malfunction \u2026\u201dXiao Yuhe did not say anything, his eyes were glued to the computer screen, and his fingers kept pressing on the slow playback button of the video.After a while, Xiao Yuhe\u2019s body slowly leaned back and made an obvious inhaling motion.\u201cPerfection realm \u2026 fist technique \u2026\u201dHe said word by word.\u201cPerfection realm fist technique \u2026\u201dThe secretary froze for a moment, her expression somewhat confused.Xiao Yuhe waved his hand and said, \u201cThis is the terminology of our martial arts world, you are not a martial artist, so you don\u2019t understand \u2026 You just need a little \u2026\u201dXiao Yuhe spoke with a complicated face: \u201cWhat I know, the ones who have trained their fist to the perfection realm at his age \u2026 are no more than ten!\u201dThe secretary was shocked.There was a feeling of uncertainty.\u201c17 years old, Perfection realm fist technique \u2026\u00a0tsk-tsk-tsk\u00a0\u2026\u201d Xiao Yuhe lampooned for a while.\u201cBut even with the help of a Perfection realm fist technique, it\u2019s quite hard to score a CPI of more than 15,000 with a BQV of 15.7, ah \u2026 the increase in combat power from Perfection realm fist techniques are only twice at most \u2026\u201d Xiao Yuhe\u2019s eyebrows furrowed fiercely.He rewound the video and rewatched it again.After watching it, then rewinding it back again \u2026During this process, Xiao Yuhe\u2019s eyes widened little by little.\u201c15.7 BQV \u2026 Ten times the standard CPI proportional to BQV \u00a0\u2026 Ordinary family \u2026\u201dFinally, when he saw it for the fifth time, Xiao Yuhe violently stood up from his seat, startling the secretary next to him.\u201cThat must be it, it must be! Otherwise, it\u2019s simply unexplainable!\u201dXiao Yuhe could not suppress his excitement and clenched his fist tightly, his excitement and elation far surpassing any precedence.The secretary quietly swallowed a mouthful of saliva.She had been Xiao Yuhe\u2019s secretary for several years and had never seen Xiao Yuhe behave like this.It was as if \u2026It was as if he had won a lottery ticket!\u201cChairman \u2026\u201d The secretary cautiously called out.He was soon done exclaiming and had finished his hysterical laugh.\u201cHaha, Xiao Xu. This time, our Baihe Martial Arts Association has really picked up a treasure! A gifted martial artist ah! How rare are gifted martial artists, ah? It\u2019s amazing that one has emerged in our Baihe city. Plus, he is so young and has such an outstanding talent in fist techniques \u2026 Hahaha \u2026\u201dThe information showed that this student named Lu Sheng, who was in his senior year, his grades in all aspects were still mediocre, or even said to be low.The information showed that this student named Lu Sheng, who was in his senior year of high school had mediocre grades, or you could even call them low. But just after entering his senior year, within a short period of one or two months, his BQV surged and his abilities in all aspects skyrocketed. Reaching the peak of Level 2, and was almost a Level 3 Martial Artist.Such a phenomenon, Xiao Yuhe could only associate this with a special group of martial artists: Talented Martial Artists![TN: Really? \u201cTalented Martial Artist\u201d? A little on the nose don\u2019t you think, author?]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 \u2014 ReverberationMartial cultivation is, in essence, the process of constantly tapping into the latent potential of the human body. In this process, a few might awaken powerful abilities that are beyond imagination. These individuals, as a collective, were simply called Talent Martial Artists.\u201cThis is the only possible explanation. Talented Martial Artists will experience a surge in BQV at the initial stage of them awakening their talent, which just so happened to coincide with the events that surround Lu Sheng. As for his outrageous combat power, that far exceeds that of a normal martial artist, it should be the natural ability that he has awakened, it might be strength related or something similar.\u201dXiao Yuhe\u2019s thoughts were clear; all his doubts about Lu Sheng dissolved, leaving behind only a sense of gratitude and joy.As a Level 6 powerhouse, he was naturally well aware of how valuable a Talented Martial Artist was.It was said that 1 official martial artist came from one out of thousand ordinary people, and then out of a thousand martial artists you couldn\u2019t be sure that even one among them was a Talented Martial Artist. By this, one could imagine how precious they were.Not to mention a gifted martial artist like Lu Sheng.Xiao Yuhe had been in office as the president of the Baihe City\u2019s Martial Arts Association for almost eight years. He had come to a conclusion that career had come to an end, and he would honestly continue retaining his position for a few more years before retiring.But\u2014Xiao Yuhe now saw hope for promotion!\u201cIf \u2026 I can nurture this seedling, Lu Sheng, properly, then when he grows to a certain height, the rewards he brings might take me to greater heights, putting me back on the social ladder \u2026\u201dXiao Yuhe was not obsessed with power, what he really cared for was what came along that power\u2014Recourses.If he could advance just one more level [through the social rung], the resources he could get were not something that could be compared to a mere president of the Baihe City Martial Arts Association. With the help of these resources, Xiao Yuhe could even possibly hope to step into that realm that he always dreamed.Level 7, Master!\u201cIf I had enough resources, why would I need to bury myself in my office and write every day? Fuck these hundred-thousand [\u201cGod\u201d] characters!\u201dXiao Yuhe had long been tired of writing.Xiao Yuhe had long since been tired of writing the character. Now he\u2019d wished to puke whenever he came across the character \u201cGod\u201d.Thinking of this, Xiao Yuhe could hardly hold back his excitement and joy, and quickly arranged for his secretary to proceed.\u201cQuick. Make haste and arrange a car for me. I wish to personally visit Lu Sheng at his home, pay my respects to his parents, and thank them for giving birth to such a good son \u2026\u201d\u201cYes, President.\u201d\u2026Ni Shuang stood at the entrance of the martial arts academy, pacing back and forth, looking a bit annoyed.A sturdy young man wearing a Red River Martial Arts Academy\u2019s martial arts uniform ran in, panting.\u201cSenior Sister Ni \u2026\u201d\u201cHow did it go? \u201dNi Shunag\u2019s eyes instantly lit up with a bit of expectation and urgency in her voice as she asked, \u201cAny news?\u201dThe youth wiped the sweat on his forehead and nodded, \u201cYes. His name is Lu Sheng. A student of Baihe Third High School, a senior in high schooler. His father works as a porter in Shen Xing Logistics, his mother works as a cashier in Jia Jia Fu supermarket. He has a younger sister, and the family lives in the 15th building of Bilan district \u2026\u201d\u201cGood! \u201dNi Shuang clenched her fist hard, her face showing a pleased look.The young man next to her was a bit puzzled and couldn\u2019t help but ask curiously, \u201cSister Ni, why are you looking for this Lu Sheng? Did he piss you off? Senior Sister, he\u2019s just a child, you don\u2019t need to push him to the brink \u2026\u201d\u201cShut up! \u201dNi Shuang couldn\u2019t listen to him anymore and interrupted; it was hindering her good mood.What is this? I\u2019m the kind of person who would call a group of people to make trouble for someone and their family because of a personal grudge?\u00a0It really made her speechless.The youth meekly shut up and did not dare to say more.After all, Ni Shuang was the establishment\u2019s owner\u2019s daughter, and she was strong. Almost no one in the academy could beat her. She was without doubt their Senior Sister.While the youth stared, Ni Shuang\u2019s phone rang.\u201cGot it.\u201dNi Shuang hung up. Her beautiful face was a canvas of complexity.The call was from her friend in the Martial Arts Association.\u201cI knew it would be soon, but I didn\u2019t expect it to be so soon \u2026\u201d Ni Shuang took a deep breath, her usual calm returned to her eyes, then she strode towards the door with big steps.\u201cTake me to his [Lu Sheng\u2019s] house. By the way, ask my juniors to buy some presents suitable for elders and 16 to 17-year-old girl. Let it be a bit expensive \u2026\u201d\u2026\u201cTeacher Zhong, I must see this student named Lu Sheng in person tomorrow. The school board will approve of the scholarship without seeing his results with their own eyes. And \u2026\u201dThe vice principal sitting behind the desk pushed the glasses on the bridge of his nose and said coldly, \u201cAs far as I know, this student named Lu Sheng has not come to school for almost two weeks. Have you contacted his parents? \u201dZhong Zhengguo frowned and said, \u201cVice Principal, you still don\u2019t believe my words? \u201d\u201cWith that grade report form you turned in? Sorry, it\u2019s really not enough.\u201d The vice principal shook his head.A trace of anger flashed in Zhong Zhengguo\u2019s eyes, but more than that, he was helpless.He had always thought that he had some say in the school, but now he knew that he was only a Level 2 Martial Artist in strength, and in the eyes of those on the school committee, he was nothing. He was just an ordinary school teacher who trained students in practical combat. There were many who could fill up that position.After a moment of silence, Zhong Zhengguo compromised.\u201cOkay, I promise that Lu Sheng will certainly be back in school within this week. But at his own request, can we not notify his parents?\u201d\u201cNo way. \u201dThe vice principal denied. \u201cBeing truant to school for more than a week is already a very serious breach of school discipline. I have given you face by not choosing to directly expel him from our school immediately. Besides, Teacher Zhong, I have to remind you that the way you handled this issue is very wrong. You are harboring a delinquent. \u2026\u201dZhong Zhengguo wanted to say something, but the vice principal waved his hand, dismissing him, indicating the termination of the conversation.Zhong Zhengguo stood up. \u00a0\u201cThen, vice principal, I\u2019ll head back first.\u201dThe vice principal indifferently hummed and looked down at his papers without even attempting any half-hearted greeting to see him off.Zhong Zhengguo sighed softly and was about to prepare to leave.Right at the moment, a man barged in through the door running.\u201cThere good news! Great news! Haha \u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38 \u2013 Door-to-Door VisitThe one to enter was an old man with a head full of white hair.Seeing the old man come in, the vice principal sitting behind his desk immediately stood up.\u201cPrincipal Ding, what brings you here?\u201dZhong Zhengguo also hurriedly opened his mouth to greet him, \u201cHello, Principal Ding. \u201dThe old man with the surname Ding was the principal of Baihe Third High School. Notwithstanding his position as the principal of the school, he held office in the Baihe City Education Bureau, and the Martial Arts Association, and was a powerful Level 5 Martial Artist himself. He was a person of great standing in Baihe City.At the moment, Principal Ding, was full of sprite, and his old face full of folds almost bloomed into a beautiful flower of a smile.\u201cPrincipal, what is it that you are so happy about?\u201dPrincipal Ding\u2019s face was full of hidden joy as he explained with a harrumph, \u201cI just received a call from President Xiao, saying that our school has a martial arts genius named Lu Sheng. Tsk, tsk, tsk, 17-year-old with a BQV of 15.7, CPI of an astounding 15, 700, meting out the standard for a Level 3 Martial Artist. If not it being President Xiao, who informed me of the matter personally, I would\u2019ve taken such a thing to be a mere joke \u2026\u00a0\u00a0He says he is a Talented Martial Artist.\u201dPrincipal Ding rambled to himself, unaware of the expressions on the faces of the two standing in front of him.\u201cPrincipal, did you just say that the Talented Martial Artist is\u2014 What\u2019s his name?\u201d Zhong Zhengguo stammered and spoke.\u201cLu Sheng!\u201dPrincipal Ding repeated the name, then smiled and patted Zhong Zhengguo on his shoulder approvingly. \u201cSpeaking of which, Teacher Zhong also gets a part of the credit. If I remember correctly, you led Lu Sheng\u2019s combat class, right \u2026?\u201dLu Sheng \u2026\u00a0Blood-Qi Value of 15.7 \u2026 Combat Power Index of 15,700 \u2026 Level 3 \u2026\u00a0Talented Martial Artist \u2026Zhong Zhengguo felt his entire body turn lethargic, he felt woozy, and he couldn\u2019t even stand straight. It was as if he was drunk, and as if he was living in a dream. As for the vice principal next to him, his eyes were open wide; mouth open so wide that you could stuff a teacup in it.They were simply too shocked to even say a word.\u2026Lu Sheng woke up to a sharp knock on the door, and had to end his training in the Dream World early.\u201cBrother \u2026 Brother, come out quick, someone is looking for you!\u201d His sister, Lu Qinghe, shouted at the door, her tone a bit anxious.\u201cGot it, will be out right away,\u201d Lu Sheng answered. A thoughtful look on his face.Lu Qinghe\u2019s behaved quite oddly, today. Her knock was too gentle to her usual calls. She did not stick to her usual apathetic words, instead called him by his given name, which later appended with \u201csomeone is looking for you\u201dLu Sheng had a guess on what it was about. He tidied his room a bit before walking out.The Lu\u2019s lived in a quite small house. The bathroom faced the living room, and was flanked by both Lu Qinghe and Lu Sheng\u2019s room on both sides of the bathroom, respectively.He ran a quick glance around the room and saw Lu Hai, Zheng Yufeng, and Lu Qinghe in the living room. Along with them, there was a man and woman sitting beside them. Strangers.Next to the sofa were placed a pile of gifts that looked pricey from the look fo the packaging.\u201cLittle Saint, come on!\u201dSeeing Lu Sheng come walk out, the bewildered Lu Hai and Zheng Yufen immediately asked him over.Others also turned their heads towards him.Lu Sheng a complicated look in Lu Qinghe\u2019s, while the other two had an ingratiating smile plastered on their faces.\u201cMom. Dad.\u201d \u00a0Lu Sheng calmly walked over, and Lu Qinghe quickly gave him a seat. \u201cThese two are \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng looked towards the man and the woman sitting on the sofa.Zheng Yufen hurriedly introduced.\u201cThis is President Xiao Yuhe from the Baihe City Martial Arts Association, and this is \u2026\u201d Zheng Yufen had a thoughtful look on her face.Ni Shuang hastily added: \u201cRed River Martial Arts Academy.\u201d\u201cRight, right!\u201dZheng Yufen remembered, \u201cMiss Ni of the Red River Martial Arts Academy.\u201d\u201cStudent Lu Sheng can be considered our regular patron. He should be no stranger to our academy. That said, we have even met once, student Lu Sheng.\u201d Ni Shuang smiled, exuding poise and comport when she addressed everyone.Lu Sheng nodded.\u201cHello, President Xiao. Hello, Miss Ni. I\u2019m Lu Sheng.\u201dLooking at Lu Sheng\u2019s calm face, Ni Shuang couldn\u2019t help but secretly sigh in her heart.\u00a0\u00a0How worthy of being the top genius of our Baihe City. He indeed is different!The people outside were going hysterical when they found out about his results at the Martial Arts Association this morning, but he, the person in question, acted as if nothing had happened.He was even sleeping in his room earlier. How able minded.Xiao Yuhe\u2019s heart was equally full of appreciation for Lu Sheng. He had seen many geniuses, but none like Lu Sheng, calm and collected, unbothered by anything. This alone put him leagues ahead of ordinary people who didn\u2019t know any better.Simply put, he was an innate martial arts seedling!\u201cYou two are here to see me because \u2026\u201dNi Shuang wisely did not say anything and conceded to Xiao Yuhe.Although the Red River Martial Arts Academy had some reputation in Baihe City, it was far worse than Xiao Yuhe, the president of the Martial Arts Association, who was a big shot that even her father, Ni Hongchuan, had to look up to. A casual stomp from an existence such as him could make the entire Baihe City tremble thrice.*[*TL: I\u2019m not sure if that was literal or just hyperbolic.]And such a big brother, now can personally come to Lu Sheng home, nestled in a small house of less than ninety square feet.And such a big shot had now personally come to Lu Sheng\u2019s home. A small house less than 90 sq. meters. This showed the amount of importance he placed on Lu Sheng.With a smile, Xiao Yuhe spoke, \u201cI came here on official business on behalf of the Baihe City Martial Arts Association. I\u2019ve come here to present you, Lu Sheng, with an official martial artist badge.\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s eyes lit up slightly, he had gone to the Martial Arts Association today to take the test for this very purpose.On the other hand, when Lu Hai and Zheng Yufen, the clueless couple, heard Xiao Yuhe they became confused for a moment.Official martial artist badge?For Lu Sheng?What the hell?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Along with the strength of a peak Level 6 Past Master with his temperament that was forged from experience and years of cultivation, he simply exuded an extremely powerful aura, the kind that ordinary people like them had only ever seen something alike on TV. Plus, Ni Shuang had come with a lot of gifts.This confused them to a great extent and had them sat and chat for a while.In fact, Lu Hai and Zheng Yufen did not have any clue what business the two even had with Lu Sheng, and were instead anxious thinking Lu Sheng had created some sort of trouble outside.As a result, now, Xiao Yuhe actually said that he came to give Lu Sheng an official martial artist badge?And now, Xiao Yuhe was saying he was here to award Lu Sheng with an official martial arts badge?Lu Hai was dumbfounded and spoke cautiously, \u201cXiao \u2026 Chairman Xiao, have you made a mistake, our Lu Sheng is still a high school student \u2026\u201dXiao Yuhe laughed and said, \u201cIt is because he is so outstanding despite being in high school, that I\u2019m here to award him and deliver the news.\u201d Saying that, Xiao Yuhe took out a beautiful brass badge from his pocket and put it in front of Lu Sheng.\u201cLittle friend Lu Sheng, I am now officially informing you on behalf of the Baihe City Martial Artists Association that you have successfully passed the examination of an official Level 2 Martial Artist. From now on, you are an official Level 2 Martial Artist certified by the Martial Arts Association \u2026\u201dXiao Yuhe said pleasantly: \u201cDue to your outstanding performance on the CPI test, you have far exceeded the category of Level 2 Martial Artist, so we\u2019ve decided that your monthly martial arts allowance will be paid according to the standard of a Level 3 Martial Artist \u2026 Not only that, due to your outstanding talent in martial arts, our Baihe Martial Arts Association will also give you a bonus of one million yuan, hoping that you will continue to strive for further glory in martial arts in the future \u2026 \u201dBoom!When Xiao Yuhe delivered his piece, Lu Hai and Zheng Yufen, who were sitting on the sofa besides him blanked out directly.Their eyes were narrowed, mouths wide open, and a buzz whipping around theri brains.If they weren\u2019t sitting on the sofa, they probably would have collapsed on the floor.Lu Sheng \u2026\u00a0Level 2 Martial Artist? Treatment of a Level 3 Martial Artist? One million yuan martial cultivation bonus?Lu Hai and Zheng Yufen wondered if they were dreaming.\u201cOne million \u2026 \u201d\u201cYou, pinch me. Am I still awake \u2026?\u201dNext to them, Lu Qinghe also had a shocked expression on her face, but was in better shape than the couple.Lu Sheng was calm.Except for the one million yuan bonus, everything else was within his expectation.\u201cMany thanks to President Xiao. \u201dLu Sheng nonchalantly put away the badge and the bonus check on the table.The check, there was nothing much to speak about it, but it was mainly the badge that attracted him. Lu Sheng had previously learned about it online. The badges of martial artists from Level 1-3 were yellow; Level 4-6 being silver; Level 7, Masters, gold; and Level 8, Grandmasters, having a diamond badge.Lu Sheng wasn\u2019t clear on the system further up.Level 9 Martial Sages were only a handful few that were scattered across the world, and they did not need to prove their identities.While holding the badge, he looked at the circular possession with patterns around the number \u201c2\u201d that represented his level. It seems to be made of brass, in fact, it is also mixed with many rare precious metals, the value of it being even higher than gold.\u201cOh yes, there is one more thing I want to inform you,\u201d Xiao Yuhe said, \u201cIn two days, there\u2019ll be a provincial training camp for high school candidates that is about to open. The association is inclined to recommend you\u2014\u201d\u201cIs President Xiao talking about the Prodigy Training Camp held by the provincial association?\u201d Ni Shuang, sitting next to him, interjected, cautiously.Xiao Yuhe turned to look at her, \u201cYou know about this camp?\u201dNi Shuang nodded and said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard of it, it\u2019s said that only the most talented martial arts geniuses in the entire Dongning Province are qualified to participate, and less than ten people from each city will be taken in.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dXiao Yuhe nodded and turned to look at Lu Sheng with a gentle face, \u201cWhat do you think, are you interested?\u201dNi Shuang took the scene in front of her eyes, and her heart couldn\u2019t help be filled with unpleasantness.She had not only heard of it, she had also enrolled in it back then.She had not only heard of it, she had even signed up for it back then. Ni Hongchuan had made use of his extensive contacts, spent gifts, but yet it all in vain. She did not get in.One could imagine how difficult it was to be enrolled in this camp. Just how many people were trying to get in every year, ah. But now with Lu Sheng, not only did the president of the Martial Arts Association personally invite him, but he was also fishing to see how Lu Sheng felt about it.As if \u2026It was as if he were begging him to go.\u201cYes.\u201dLu Sheng nodded his head.From what he took from Ni Shuang and Xiao Yuhe\u2019s conversation, this Prodigy Training Camp must be all benefits with no downsides. Since that was the case, there was no harm in going for a bit.\u201cGood!\u201dXiao Yuhe looked quite happy, then stood up from the sofa.\u201cSince my purpose here is achieved. I shall not be a bother anymore.\u201dBefore Xiao Yuhe left, he deliberately shook hands with Lu Hai and Zheng Yufen, and said with solemnity: \u201cThank you for raising such an outstanding son.\u201dLu Hai and Zheng Yufen, on the other hand, saw Xiao Yuhe off, their brains still not registering what had happened.\u201cIs it real or not? A Level 2 Martial Artist. A million yuan bonus \u2026 Is it not some mistake? Could it be that there is someone else with the given name and family name as our son, Lu Sheng \u2026\u201dLu Hai turned Lu Sheng\u2019s martial artist badge over and over again in his hands.Ni Frost couldn\u2019t help but smile, saying, \u201cUncle, aunty, you do not need to doubt it. It is your son Lu Sheng. Lu Sheng went to the Martial Arts Association this morning for an assessment, the results he got were very excellent. Did you not see that even President Xiao was alarmed? I estimate the story to be on news tomorrow \u2026\u201d\u201cOn the news \u2026?\u201d Lu Hai froze.On the other side, Zheng Yufen who was on her phone looked up in a hurry: \u201cIt truly was the president of our Baihe City Martial Arts Association, Xiao Yuhe! It\u2019s all over the internet, there are even photos \u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 \u2013 Honorary Disciple, Lu Qinghe\u2019s Shock\u201cI think it is time to reveal what you are here for.\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s gaze landed on Ni Shuang, and said in a calm tone.Ni Shaung looked stunned.At the moment she suddenly felt Lu Sheng\u2019s temperament shift completely. If before he seemed introverted, now he looked slightly liberated. Like a reticent lion that inadvertently bared its fangs. The aura he radiated, for a moment, made her fall into the illusion that she was facing her own father, Ni Hongchuan.A small feeling of oppressive tension rose within her.This being her, who was an official Level 3 Martial Artist.\u201cI came here to \u2026\u201dAfter all, Ni Shuang was someone who usually directed the academy, so she quickly calmed her nerves and spoke, \u201cI\u2019m here to invite you, student Lu Sheng, to become an honorary disciple of our Red River Martial Arts Academy.\u201d\u201cHonorary disciple?\u201dLu Sheng frowned, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like any other disciple, really. You need not come every day, but of course you come anytime and whenever you feel like. All the courses and equipment are free to use. You can even have Father personally instruct you. You\u2019ll also enjoy the highest level treatment comparable to a head instructor \u2026 In fact, the title is just nominal, you do not have any actual obligations to fulfill \u2026\u201d Ni Shuang hurriedly explained. This honorary disciple title was something she had just come up with.There had always been only honorary instructors and honorary trainers, there had never been any honorary disciples.But Lu Sheng was too young to be hired as a head instructor, and the martial arts academy valued him mainly for his terrifying talent, so Ni Shuang came up with this title.A seventeen-year-old Level 2 Martial Artist, with a CPI on par with a Level 3 Martial Artist.If such a sign was put out, will the Red River Martial Arts Academy not blow up in Baihe City? How many parents would rush to sent their children to their academy? The effect of such a step was better than finding a Level 4 or even Level 5 Martial Artist to instruct.This is what Ni Shuang thought.\u201cNo.\u201dLu Sheng decisively refused.\u201cThe treatment can be negotiated \u2026\u201d Ni Frost hastily conceded.Lu Sheng, however, turned her words around and continued, \u201cI\u2019m fine with an honorary membership. You can advertise that I usually come practice in you Martial Arts Academy, which is indeed true \u2026\u201dThe word \u201cdisciple\u201d involved too many implications.The director of the Red River Martial Arts Academy, Ni Hongchuan, Lu Sheng had never even met him, how could he possibly admit to being a disciple of a person, even if it was just titular. He did not want someone using his name to swindle.Though he had a good impression of the Red River Martial Arts Academy, at the end of the day, it was just that\u2014a good impression.\u201cIf you can accept it, so be it, if not, then I\u2019m sorry \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng said indifferently, \u201cOf course I will probably still go to your academy to do tests in the future.\u201dAfter all, it was closer to home.Ni Shuang\u2019s eyes struggled for a moment and eventually softened.\u201cOkay, honorary membership it is. The previous terms apply here as well. Just that I want this honorary title to be exclusive to our Red River Martial Arts Academy.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201d Lu Sheng nodded.This meant that in the future, the Red River Martial Arts Academy would have to pay Lu Sheng a sum of money every month, equivalent to the salary of the highest ranked instructor of their institute, which was about 100,000 yuan.The only thing Lu Sheng needed to do was to admit to the public that he frequented the Red River Martial Arts Academy. Lu Sheng felt that it was okay to do such a business.\u201cThen I won\u2019t bother everyone anymore.\u201d Ni Shuang stood up and bid farewell. Although the final result was a bit different from what she expected, it was not entirely unacceptable.Ni Frost was very clear on her part. After Lu Sheng\u2019s test results spread in Baihe City, when the time came, they would make more than what they had spent on this \u201chonorary membership\u201d.Speaking of which, their Red River Martial Arts Academy can also be considered lucky. \u00a0The location of the academy just happened to be in the neighborhood of Lu Sheng\u2019s home which granted them this chance.After sending Ni Shuang away, the family cleaned up.Lu Sheng took a look at his parents who were still fiddling with the badge and check, and told them, \u201cI\u2019ll head back to my room. Call me when it\u2019s time for dinner.\u201dAfter saying that, he turned around and left.The badge and the million yuan check seemed not to faze him as he strode back into his room.\u2026Lu Qinghe was in a state of deep shock. This had begun when she was in the Martial Arts Association in the morning. When Yang Yuan had brought up the name, Lu Qinghe thought she might\u2019ve heard it wrong. Or rather, she had assumed they were two people who just shared the same name.It was the first time Lu Qinghe had seen Senior Sister Yang Yuan give such an expression. In her heart, Senior Sister Yang Yuan should be beautiful, high, and cold, always proud, always the genius, the idol she always worshiped.But at that moment Yang Yuan displayed strong frustration, powerlessness, helplessness, and lack of confidence. It was the first time she saw Senior Sister Yang Yuan look up to a person. And that person was her own brother?How is this possible! Even if Lu Sheng did change a lot this time. Starting from his looks, image, temperament, meal size, grades and other aspects, he had become almost unrecognizable to her.But.No matter how many changes he may undergo, it was impossible for him to reach such a height to make Senior Sister Yang Yuan idolize him!Impossible! Absolutely impossible!\u00a0It is definitely a similar name; just a technical error.\u00a0\u00a0Lu Qinghe kept telling herself this. As a result, after returning home, something even more outrageous happened.The president of the Baihe City Martial Arts Association, Xiao Yuhe, actually personally visited home because of Lu Sheng.Lu Qinghe knew Xiao Yuhe.Once Baihe First Middle School held a school-wide event, the school specially invited this pivotal figure.The principal and director on both sides were smiling, their faces full of glory, as if it was a matter of great honor to invite Xiao Yuhe.Lu Qinghe was completely confused.Then this big shot, who usually can only be seen on TV, cheerfully began to praise and encourage Lu Sheng, and even personally gave him a martial arts badge and a bonus \u2026 This situation was all too familiar to Lu Qinghe.Since childhood, every time after the examination results, the class teacher called her on stage to shower her with praise, and she\u2019d have a face brimming with joy.It was that kind of situation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 \u2013 That\u2019s him!But that was just a teacher at school.Who was Xiao Yuhe?He was the president of the Baihe City\u2019s Martial Arts Association, one of the bigwigs of the Baihe City.There was simply no comparison between the two.Looking at the bronze-coloured badge that her parents held in their hands and were flipping over and over, just short of taking a bite out of it, that it occurred to Lu Qinghe.There was a time when one of the students in her class secretly brought her dad\u2019s badge to school to show off to them, and she had seen it once.But that was only a Level 1 Martial Artist badge. This was the first time she was seeing a Level 2 Martial Artist badge.What\u2019s more, there was a bonus. A sum of million yuan in prize money! Today was also the day she found out a scholarship could be so outrageous!It was such a huge shock that Lu Qinghe was stunned by the impact.She sat on the sofa for a long while, and only when her mood eased up a little did she get up.\u201cMom and Dad, I\u2019m going back to my room.\u201d Lu Qinghe said. Her parents didn\u2019t respond.Lu Hai and Zheng Yufen were still staring at the two items in their hands and chattering about it amongst themselves.A sourness inexplicably roe in Lu Qinghe\u2019s heart.This was the first time she had been ignored by her parents since she was a child, or was she feeling this because of her brother, Lu Sheng?It\u2019s so unfair\u00a0\u2026\u2026\u201cNo results yet?\u201d He Ling Su asked as she walked around the shop impatiently.Ma Fei cautiously answered, \u201cI can occasionally get in touch with him, but every time, before I could even say anything, he hangs up on me.\u201d\u201cUseless! Weren\u2019t you patting your chest and saying it was absolutely no problem earlier? I trusted you\u2026\u201d He Ling Su stomped her foot and pointed at Ma Fei\u2019s nose, chastising him.Ma Fei felt suffocated, but he didn\u2019t dare refute her. Who told him to make such promises? He had lost all face now.He Ling Su was so annoyed. It had been a week. It had been more than a week, and she still hadn\u2019t been able to meet the mysterious pharmacist. She didn\u2019t even know what he looked like or what his name was.If she couldn\u2019t meet him, she couldn\u2019t get the new potion.Without the new medicine, there was no way for the He family to get out of their current predicament. That was why He Ling Su was so anxious and angry that she had barely slept well for the past week, and her skin had even dulled considerably.All her time and energy went into this new medicine, and while she was at it, she had received news about several other medicines, but she didn\u2019t go.She was afraid that if she walked away, she would miss out if the mysterious pharmacist returned. In theory, this was not necessary at all, casting more nets usually meant you can catch more fish.But the current situation couldn\u2019t be dealt merely with common sense.During this week, He Ling Su kept analysing the pharmacology and ingredients of that mysterious medicinal liquid. The deeper her studies went, the more astonishing results she obtained.The efficacy of this unknown supplement, in strengthening blood, exceeded all the Grade 1 and Grade 2 supplements that were available in the market, which met the standards released by the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, and even surpassed some of the Grade 3 supplements.Not only that, but it had more than a dozen additional effects, with almost non-existent side effects, and the overall effective period was frighteningly long.And with such excellent medicinal conditions, the cost of this supplement \u2026Surprisingly, it is only more than double the cost of Blood Nourishing Potion! Which wasn\u2019t even considered a proper supplement! God! It wasn\u2019t even officially recognized as a Grade 1 Supplement.Nowadays, Blood Nourishing Potion was at best a health supplement, and only families with poor economic conditions would buy it as a potion for martial arts training.But this wasn\u2019t the most crucial point about this mysterious supplement.He Ling Su had to search through the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association\u2019s database, but didn\u2019t find a single mention of this supplement.There was nothing similar either.What were its implications? It meant that, in all likelihood, this was a new supplement that had just been developed.A great new medicine with epoch-making significance!This was why He Ling Su was so adamant, clinging to it, throwing her weight around, and insisting on putting all her eggs in one basket.This was not a basket, this was a gold mine that could bring the He family back from the dead!It was just that \u2026 This golden mountain was now visible and untouchable, and she had yet to find a way to the foot of the golden mountain.He Ling Su sighed softly and tiredly rubbed her temples.\u201cHe \u2026 Miss He \u2026\u201d She heard Ma Fei call her.\u201cWhat is it?!\u201d He Ling Su asked unenthusiastically.Ma Fei had no skill whatsoever, but he was top-notch in bragging; she couldn\u2019t stand the sight of him.\u201cI \u2026 I\u2019ve found that master.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d He Ling Su froze for a moment, and her whole body jumped up. \u201cWhere is he? Where\u2019s that master?!\u201dOnly to see Ma Fei with an incredibly strange expression on his face, his eyes staring straight in one direction. He then pointed out using his finger.\u201cRight there.\u201dHe Ling Su immediately turned her head and what she saw was the television set placed in the lobby of the pharmacy.A news message was being broadcast on the television at the moment.\u201c\u2026 Yesterday, an incomparably outstanding martial arts genius has appeared in our city. At only 17 years old, he passed the official examination for a Level 2 Martial Artist, and his Combat Power Index even reached the standard of a Level 3 Martial Artist.\u201cThis feat has broken all previous records for martial artists previously set in our city for his age group. Even the president of the Martial Arts Association, Mr. Xiao Yuhe, expressed his high appreciation and encouragement for this young martial arts genius.\u201cThis martial arts genius, Lu Sheng, who is currently studying in Class 5 Senior Year of Baihe High School.It is understood that student Lu Sheng \u2026\u201dHe Ling Su was staring at the television in a daze, when she heard Ma Fei\u2019s hushed voice.\u201cMiss He, the one who borrowed our blending room, and the one we have trying to contact \u2026 it\u2019s this Lu Sheng.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d He Ling Su\u2019s eyes snapped wide open.Lu Sheng \u2026 martial arts genius\u2026 a master pharmacist \u2026He Ling Su looked at the young and almost juvenile face, with handsome features, that was announced in the news. Her mind buzzed for a moment, as if a hundred planes were flying over her head at the same time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 \u2014 What\u2019s wrong with this worldLu Sheng sat at his desk, browsing information on the internet.After receiving the official Level 2 Martial Artist certification from the Martial Arts Association, Lu Sheng found that he could log into a website called \u201cMartial Artist Home.\u201dThis website detailed the various powers official martial artists held.Beside the monthly allowance that people envied, the official artists enjoyed many other privileges.For example, martial artists and their families did not need to queue up when going to the hospital, and they could enjoy special discounts when buying houses and cars. Their children also received extra points when applying for schools and taking college entrance exams, etc.And there were also the obligations that martial artists needed to fulfil.Which was only one. When the country was in need, the official martial artists needed unconditionally respond to the call and head to the frontlines for battle.In addition to information, Martial Artist Home provided many other services. Its main business was to provide a wide range of services to martial artists, such as selling a variety of \u201cmartial artist only\u201d potions, supplement, weapons, and other materials.There were even online classes that taught martial arts, but one had to pay to watch them.\u201cThe permission martial artists have varies with the levels. The higher the permission, the higher content and resources they have access to \u2026\u201dLu Sheng turned off the website and said to himself, \u201cThis is similar to the Fireseed Repository.\u201dHe had the crystallized wisdom of the entire human martial civilization of more than 10,000 years, this so-called Martial Artist Home was really of little use to him.He wouldn\u2019t use it unless necessary, and he needed it to answer some of his queries. But if even the Fireseed Repository didn\u2019t have the information he was looking for, it was impossible for it to be here.Lu Sheng stood up from the computer and dragged out a small wooden box of one foot square from under the bed. This box contained some of Lu Sheng\u2019s memories. The toys that he played with when he was a child, confession letters from his female classmates, old photos and so on.Now Lu Sheng used it to fill it with medicinal supplements.He opened the box to find twelve neatly placed vials, of which eleven were empty.Lu Sheng took out the last vial. The light green liquid looked like flowing emerald through the sun\u2019s light.Lu Sheng pulled off the cork and drank the liquid from the vial in one go.\u201cThe last one \u2026\u201dLu Sheng felt the gradually surging hot flow in his body and silently started to perform the starting posture of \u201cStellar Body Refining Technique\u201d.\u201cGot to prepare another batch of supplements.\u201dLu Sheng had the money from Xiao Yuhe, who had given him a million yuan as a bonus, the monthly allowance, and the \u201ctitle fee\u201d remitted by the Red River Martial Arts Academy.For the time being, he no longer needed to worry about the money to buy medicinal supplements.He could even afford the machines that were required to blend the medicines ingredients to creates potions and other medicinal supplements.\u2026\u201cHow come you suddenly want to go to Shuhai City? Shuhai City is not bigger than our Baihe City. What things do you have to buy there \u2026\u201d Zheng Yufen rambled on as she was packing Lu Sheng\u2019s things.Lu Hai sat on the sofa with a smile on his face, looking at his child, whom he was most proud of, and said, \u201cOh, he has grown up and has his own plans. Why do you care so much about him? Just let him go.\u201dZheng Yufen nodded and said, \u201cIt\u2019s good to go out for a few days, to get away from the wind \u2026\u201dThese days, Lu Sheng\u2019s family had become the \u201cstar family\u201d of the whole neighbourhood. They didn\u2019t know how many people visited them every day.Even when Lu Hai and Zheng Yufen were walking on the street, they would be stopped by people who would praise them or ask for advice.At first, Lu Dahai and Zheng Yufen enjoyed it, but they soon became overwhelmed. Now Zheng Yufen was even afraid to go out and buy groceries.Lu Qinghe was in a similar situation. As soon as she entered the school, she would be surrounded by the whole school who wanted to know more about Lu Sheng, the famous martial artist genius.This had become a daily occurrence for her. Every day, she received requests for Lu Sheng\u2019s autograph, or asking him out for dinner, or to hand Lu Sheng confession letters. Just the confession letters were enough to fill a whole drawer. With her cell phone inbox always showing 999+.Even, Senior Sister Yang Yuan began to consciously or unconsciously ask her about her brother\u2019s affairs since yesterday.\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with this world!\u201dLu Qinghe sat at the dining table and took a bite of the bread in her hand, sadness flowing in her expressions.In just a few days, her brother, who only knew how to skip classes and sleep every day, had become a martial arts genius and the star of the city.And his genius sister, who was always seen as an example since she was a child, had become a pathetic little girl that no one cared about.If even his family was treated like this, let alone the party concerned, Lu Sheng.This was also one of the reasons why Lu Sheng was ready to go out today.\u201cOkay, I\u2019m heading out, if I dally any longer, I\u2019ll miss the bus.\u201dLu Sheng pulled the zip of the suitcase and said to Lu Hai and Zheng Yufen, \u201cMom and Dad, I won\u2019t come back after I finish my business in Shuhai. Chairman Xiao said that the induction ceremony will start in two days, so I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be coming back for a while.\u201d\u201cHow long will this training go on for \u2026\u201d\u201cAbout a few months, I\u2019m not really sure \u2026\u201dDuration of the training camp could vary. It would sometimes be short, while other time be long. Xiao Yuhe had told him that the longest the training camp went on for was a half a year.\u201cThen you have to be careful out there alone, pay attention to the climate. Do you have enough money on you? Do you want to bring a few more sets of clothes with you? \u2026\u201dZheng Yufen had a worried expression on her and kept nagging.After staying back for a few more minutes, Lu Sheng went out.Before leaving, Lu Sheng saw Lu Qinghe sitting at the table, eating breakfast in a sulky mood. He couldn\u2019t help but walk up to her and rub her head hard. \u201cI\u2019m leaving. Remember to listen to Mom and Dad at home, study hard, and stay out of trouble \u2026\u201dTo his surprise, Lu Qinghe didn\u2019t argue with him this time. Instead, she softly replied with an \u201cOh\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 \u2013 Climbing: The Correct Way to Use the Natural Breathing TechniqueShuhai City, Wild Fox Mountain.Among the lush mountains and forests, two figures were struggling to climb upwards.They were a young couple wearing mountaineering clothes, looking quite dishevelled with panting breaths.\u201cIt\u2019s all your fault! The tour guide warned us that this path is difficult and even Level 1 Martial Artists may not be able to make it, but you insisted on going. Now you can\u2019t climb any more \u2026 I guess we won\u2019t even reach the top of the mountain in the dark!\u201dThe girl among the couple stopped, reached out to hold a tree, and began to complaining to her boyfriend.The boy scratched his head in embarrassment and defended, \u201cI thought that since we are both Level 1 Martial Artists, we could give it a try. Who knew it would be so difficult \u2026But we should be near to the top of the mountain, so hang in there a little longer, my dear.\u201dThe girl shook her head, \u201cI don\u2019t care, I can\u2019t walk any more, either you carry me up, or I won\u2019t go \u2026\u201d\u201cStop kidding me, your BQV is higher than mine, and you want me to carry you? \u2026\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s joking with you, are you going to carry me or not? \u2026\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dSeeing that the conversation was about to slowly turn into an argument, the boy suddenly saw something, his expression suddenly became serious, he pointed, saying to the girl, \u201cLook, that person!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t try to change the topic.\u201dThe girl said, but still looked in the direction where the boy was pointing. Only to see someone coming up the same mountain path they had taken. The person was frighteningly fast.It took them almost an hour to walk the distance, but the person covered the same distance in a speed that was visible to the naked eye.Wherever that person passed by, the leaves and trees on both sides parted, as if a dark green wave was rushing towards them at lightning speed.\u201cHiss\u2013\u201d The girl sucked in a breath of cold air, she looked shaken.\u201cLevel 3, at least a Level 3 Martial Artist! He\u2019s simply too fast! \u2026 We know how difficult it is to climb up this path. Even us, two Level 1 Martial Artists, are almost out of energy. Yet he can maintain such speed. He must have a terrifying BQV. It\u2019s possible that he might even be a Level 4 Martial Artist!\u201dThe boy also nodded heavily.Both of them were official martial artists, and they had good judgement for such aspects.Due to the steepness of the trail, the two couldn\u2019t make out the person\u2019s features, and the huge bag also added to the concealing effect.But one thing is for certain. This must\u2019ve been a senior whose achievements in martial arts far exceeded theirs, and who strength was around Level 3 or Level4.As the silhouette continued to approach, their two faces reflected awe on them.They had a tacit agreement to take a few steps to the sides to make way for the person coming.Finally, the person arrived in front of the two.Just as the person brushed past them, the two widened their eyes. It was as if they had seen something extremely incredible. They were incomparably shocked.Swish!The person carrying a hiking bag quickly ran past the two people and quickly moved away in the blink of an eye.\u201cFuck!\u201dThe boy couldn\u2019t help but curse as he turned his head to look at his girlfriend.\u201cAm I seeing things?\u201d He had a confused expression on him.The girl also opened her mouth wide and looked frozen, obviously not yet recovered from the huge shock.Just as the man had just brushed past them, they had seen it.The person they had identified as a senior in martial arts was actually an incomparably young-looking teenager.Looking at most seventeen or eighteen years old, even the fluff on his lips hadn\u2019t completely faded away![TN: \u201cFluff on someone\u2019s lips\u201d is a phrase used to indicate someone young, and hasn\u2019t grown facial hair.]\u201cSo young? Level 3? Or even a Level 4 Martial Artist?!\u201dThe guy began doubting his life.Thinking of his own experience climbing the mountain trail that resulted in a sore back, he felt that the martial arts he had learned over ten years were all for naught.\u2026\u201cHuff-huff-huff\u2014\u201dLu Sheng passed by the young couple and dashed towards the mountain top.His chest rose and fell rhythmically, and the interval between each breath was far longer than an ordinary person\u2019s.His footsteps were so fast that they were like cannonballs.Each step could span a distance of seven or eight meters, resulting in an incomparably fast speed.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that Stellar Power could also be applied to movement technique. With the four times the Stellar Power and the absorption of a large amount of dream memories, I have reached the bottleneck in my proficiency in movement techniques. My speed is at least five times faster than a normal Level 2 Martial Artist!\u201d\u201cAlso, there\u2019s the Natural Breathing Technique. I only just realized the correct way to use it \u2026\u201dAlthough in the past few days, Lu Sheng\u2019s BQV had increased, it was still far from reaching the standards of a Level 3 Martial Artist. He was able to maintain his speed all the way up until now, entirely because of the Natural Breathing Technique.This breathing technique, which was hailed as the strongest to the highest in the martial world 10,000 years in the future, finally burst into unparalleled brilliance when Lu Sheng\u2019s physical strength reached its limit.Every time Lu Sheng breathed, it was as if he could draw some energy from the surrounding air, which greatly replenished his depleted stamina.Under the impetus of the Natural Breathing Technique, Lu Sheng\u2019s body continued to produce even greater strength.Whenever he felt that he could barely hold on, the Natural Breathing Technique could always extract newfound power from his muscles.Lu Sheng knew that this was a sign of breaking through his body\u2019s limits, time and time again.Boom!Lu Sheng landed heavily on top of a platform with both feet.He had already reached the top of the Wild Fox Mountain.At this moment, Lu Sheng\u2019s body was steaming with vapor, and his entire body emitted a high temperature far beyond that of normal people.He seemed to be able to hear the sound of blood surging and rushing within his veins \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 \u2013 Breakthrough, Teaching You a Thing On Behalf of Your ParentsLu Sheng exhaled a long foul breath, and he felt much more relaxed.\u201cBreakthrough!\u201dLu Sheng slightly clenched his fist and could clearly feel his Blood Qi Value skyrocket by a large amount.\u201cThe growth in BQV means that my physique has also improved, and I can continue practising the Stellar Body Refining Technique. I estimate \u2026\u201dLu Sheng sensed internally for a while, \u201cI should be able to generate six times the Stellar Power.\u201dThis meant that his Combat Power Index would also have skyrocketed again.In fact, Lu Sheng felt that all these gains were secondary, and his biggest gain today was figuring out the correct way to practice the Natural Breathing Technique during the climb.\u201cRapid stamina recovery, greatly enhance endurance, constant stimulation of my potential \u2026 these are all fine during regular practice, but the same were applied during actual battle, the results would simply be terrifying \u2026\u201dJust imagining Lu Sheng, who with his Natural Breathing Technique possessed the ability to rapidly recover his stamina, endurance that was few times or even dozen or so times of that of an ordinary martial artist, and this process could continuously push him to surpass his physical limits.Under such conditions, not to mention the martial artists of the same level, he could even wear down opponents that were much stronger than him.It was simply like getting stronger as he met stronger opponents.\u201cWith the breakthrough in BQV and the discovery of the herb that is required for the Marrow Nourishing Pill, my purpose in coming to Shuhai has been fully accomplished.\u201dLu Sheng felt relaxed.He had come to Shuhai City for the Marrow Nourishing Pill. One of the medicinal herbs for the Marrow Nourishing Pill needed to be freshly picked to be effective, and this medicinal herb was only available on the Wild Fox Mountain.Lu Sheng had come to the Wild Fox Mountain to buy the medicine, and happened to climb up the mountain. Unexpectedly, he achieved a breakthrough in both his BQV, and as well as his Stellar Power.The path Lu Sheng took up the mountain was steep and difficult to walk, and no one usually took it, so there was no platform leading to the mountaintop.Lu Sheng just stood there to enjoy the scenery, almost completely recovered, and then slowly walk down the other way.Going down went much slower than climbing up.When he reached the foot of the mountain, a dark-skinned, short, and thin middle-aged man squatting by the roadside smoking saw him and immediately walked up.\u201cYoung man, the herbs you want have been picked. It\u2019s not far away. Come with me.\u201dLu Sheng nodded, followed the middle-aged man.Because the herbs that Lu Sheng wanted, had to be freshly picked, he had hired a man to pick them for him.The dark-skinned, thin middle-aged man led him to a rather remote location, with several bamboo medicine baskets on the ground.Lu Sheng saw four or five men standing not far away, as if they were waiting for something, and now and then glanced up towards them.\u201cThe medicine is in the basket.\u201dThe middle-aged man casually picked up a medicine basket and handed it to Lu Sheng.The basket was filled with light purple herbs. Some of them still had dew and soil on them. They looked like freshly picked herbs.Lu Sheng was very satisfied and nodded his head. \u201cOkay, I want ten of them. According to the previous agreement, five hundred for each, that\u2019s five thousand \u2026\u201dUnexpectedly, the middle-aged man shook his head.\u201cNo, it\u2019s a thousand per stalk, and you have to buy all the herbs here.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Lu Sheng frowned.The middle-aged man smiled at him, revealing a mouth full of yellow teeth.\u201cLittle friend, you are not a native of Shuhai, right? \u2026\u201dAs he spoke, a few men who had been standing at a distance slowly walked over and stared at Lu Sheng with malicious intent. Obviously, they were in cahoots with the middle-aged man.Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly, and he looked at the thin middle-aged man in front of him: \u201cAre you trying to force a deal?\u201dThe dark and skinny middle-aged man sneered. \u201cKid, let me teach you something on behalf of your parents. When you\u2019re outside, you have to admit defeat. Do you understand?\u201cDon\u2019t even think about calling the police. There are no surveillance cameras and no one else here. Even if the police came, they wouldn\u2019t believe a foreigner like you.\u201cPay the money honestly and save us from being rude to you.\u201dA few men with a fierce look on their faces were about to surround Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng thought about it, bent down and picked up a fist-sized rock from the ground. It was the kind of large cobblestone that was used to pave the road. It could be seen everywhere.\u201cStill want to resist? Little brat!\u201dThe middle-aged man\u2019s eyes turned cold, and he was about to order his men to charge at Lu Sheng, but the next moment, the expression on his face suddenly froze.Swish-swish-swish!A large amount of pebbles, no bigger than half of a little finger, fell from between Lu Sheng\u2019s fingertips. As Lu Sheng continued to rub his fingers, these pebbles were quickly ground into even smaller particles.The middle-aged man and the group behind him looked dumbfounded. They stared blankly without uttering a single word.\u201cWhat did you just say to me?\u201d Lu Sheng looked at him with a calm face.\u201cNothing \u2026 Nothing \u2026\u201dThe middle-aged man took a few steps back, his dark face was pale with fear as he stammered and spoke: \u201cTake everything, no money! I won\u2019t charge a penny!\u201dBehind him, several other men were looking at Lu Sheng as if they had seen a ghost; palpitating with fear.Lu Sheng shook the dirt off his hands. Under the dust, his palms were clean as earlier.Lu Sheng casually picked up a medicine basket, walked to the middle-aged man said solemnly: \u201cI will also teach you a thing on behalf of your parents. While doing business, you should always be honest, and never deceive anyone. Be it young or old.\u201d He walked away after saying that.The middle-aged man and his companions stood in place for a long time. It was only when Lu Sheng\u2019s figure had disappeared for a long time that a sentence came out of his mouth.\u201cFuck, are all the high school students so fucking perverted, nowadays?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 \u2013 Marrow Nourishing Pill\u201cI was originally planning to pay, but since you didn\u2019t want it, it\u2019s a pity \u2026\u201dWith the whole basket of herbs in hand, Lu Sheng returned to the hotel where he was staying. For him, this little incident had no impact at all.Lu Sheng was very clear that the darkness in this world could not be completely eradicated. But he could make himself strong.As long as he was strong enough, he would be like a source of light, and wherever he went, darkness would automatically retreat and dissipate.Lu Sheng\u2019s originally intended on making around ten Marrow Nourishing Pills to test their effects first. But after unexpectedly obtaining so many medicinal herbs, he decided to make more of them.The difficulty of refining Marrow Nourishing Pills was much greater than that of Spiritual Muscle and Blood Strengthening Decoction, and it would be difficult for him to refine them all in a short time with his own strength.So Lu Sheng came up with a solution.He found many pharmacies in Shuhai City and hired them to process the herbs needed for the Marrow Nourishing Pills. This could save a large part of his effort.The main thing was that the processing of the herbs did not require much skill and was very tedious.Lu Sheng himself only need to be responsible for the final mixing and decocting.However, he would have to go to many places every time he wanted to get the herbs. Nevertheless, it would greatly reduce the possibility of the prescription being leaked.Just like that, Lu Sheng began to live a fulfilling and regular life every day.Get the herbs, make the pills, cultivate, and sleep. Repeat.Three days later, Lu Sheng, who was wearing a robe, sat on the hotel bed. He took out a pill as dark as onyx from a glass vial and gently dropped it into his mouth.He chewed and swallowed it.A few seconds later, an incredible heat surged out from Lu Sheng\u2019s body.This surging heat was like an earthworm, drilling into Lu Sheng\u2019s bones, bringing him an incomparable tingling and numbing sensation.Lu Sheng\u2019s body did not remain idle while he was at it. He began to follow the movements of the Stellar Body Refining Technique and practised it, while also using the Natural Breathing Technique.As Lu Sheng cultivated, the room began to be filled with a faint mist and the temperature began to rise.In the end, the large room was hazy with white mist, and the centre of the room was surging with heat.It was as if a star was really being nurtured in the nebula.\u201cPhew \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng exhaled a long breath. The hot breath blowing away the thick white mist in the room.Lu Sheng stood up and turned on the air conditioning, walked into the bathroom while silently contemplating about the Marrow Nourishing Pill he had just taken.The nourishing effect of the Marrow Nourishing Pills on his blood and qi was many times greater than that of the Spiritual Muscle and Blood Strengthening Decoction.Even after Lu Sheng had taken a pill, he was unable to completely absorb the medicinal power of the Marrow Nourishing Pill. There were still a lot of residual effects left in his body.You should know that what he was practising was the \u201cStellar Body Refining Technique\u201d, in addition to the \u201cNatural Breathing Technique\u201d. One could only imagine how terrifying the effects of the \u201cMarrow Nourishing Pill\u201d were.\u201cNo wonder the Nourishing Marrow Pill is a graded supplement. \u00a0While the Spiritual Muscle and Blood Strengthening Decoction is simply just a medicinal decoction \u2026\u201dThis grading of supplements was still something Lu Sheng learned about recently.He was afraid that the difficulty of making the Marrow Nourishing Pill would be too high, and that his failure rate increasing as he went on. Therefore, he specifically hunted the memories of several zombies who used to be pharmacists when they were alive.These kinds of people\u2014pharmacists\u2014were very easy to find. He could just go into any random pharmacy and walk in to them.All of Lu Sheng\u2019s knowledge about medicines and supplements came from the memories of these pharmacists.\u201cEven in the 10,000 years of martial cultivation, the Marrow Nourishing Pill was one of the most suitable medicinal pills for martial artists below Level 3.\u201cThis is because in addition to replenishing a practitioner\u2019s blood and qi, the Marrow Nourishing Pill also had a certain tempering effect on the user\u2019s bones.\u201cAnd the process of promoting a Level 3 Martial Artist to a Level 4 Martial Artist involves the process the martial artist tempering his bones \u2026\u201dLu Sheng had been taking two types of supplements: Spiritual Musles and Blood Strengthening Decoction, and the Marrow Nourishing Pills.The former had a tempering effect on the martial artist\u2019s musles, while the latter tempered the bones.In a sense, in the process of taking these two supplements, Lu Sheng had also long been unconsciously and subtly tempering his musles, tendons, and bones.He would only realize the effects of his current gains after he was promoted to a Level 3 Martial Artist. Given his advantages, it wouldn\u2019t take him much time be promoted to a Level 3 or Level 4 Martial Artist, unlike an ordinary martial artist.\u201cIn total, I prepared more than fifty sets of herbs and finally made twenty-five Marrow Nourishing Pills. It seems like a lot, but I don\u2019t know how long I will be in the training camp. It might not be enough \u2026\u201dLu Sheng thought to himself as he looked at the few small bottles filled with Marrow Cleansing Pills in front of him.A success rate of 50% was actually very high.From the memories of the pharmacists he had absorbed, generally speaking, a Level 1 or Level 2 pharmacist refining a Marrow Nourishing Pill would be thankful if he could succeed once out of four attempts .Logically speaking, a newbie like Lu Sheng who had just started making medicine should not have such a success rate. He did not know what caused it.It was the same when he concocted the Spiritual Muscles and Blood Strengthening Decoction. The success rate was shockingly high.Lu Sheng did not think of himself as some kind of pharmaceutical genius.He guessed that it might be related to the fact that he absorbed a lot of dream memories, and his spiritual power and other aspects were much stronger compared to normal people.Lu Sheng packed up everything in his room and put several vials of marrow raising pills carefully in his suitcase to prevent them from being damaged.If it were not for the fact that he had to rush to the Dongning Province to participate in the Prodigy Training Camp\u2019s induction ceremony, he would have stayed here for a while longer.After all, the fresh herbs for refining the Marrow Nourishing Pill were only available in Shuhai City, so he\u2019d have to come back to Shuhai to replenish his stock if he ran out. Which was a lot of trouble.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 \u2014 No Flaws, No Omissions, Absolute Martial Path!Dreamworld.Lu Sheng shuttled between the dilapidated streets of Base 1359. Everywhere he passed, the zombies that wandered around mindlessly fell one by one, crumbling rapidly.Lines of black smoke flew like swallows, diving into Lu Sheng\u2019s body one by one.\u201cWhew!\u201dLu Sheng stopped and looked at the street that became empty behind him, and found a place to sit and recuperate.This time, he consciously began to clean up Base 1359.He\u2019d clear out the weak zombies first and leave the strong ones for later. Currently, this cleaning work had just progressed to two streets.\u201cI\u2019ve absorbed too many memories, I need to digest them \u2026\u201dDuring the cleaning process, Lu Sheng absorbed too many fragments of memories, including numerous useful and useless memories. These memories rushed into his mind all at once, causing him to feel like his brain had swollen up due to the overload.Lu Sheng closed his eyes and began to practice the Crystal Contemplation Method.In his mind, a human form completely carved out of crystal was gradually taking shape, and only the feet were left to take form.As Lu Sheng continued to contemplate, the outline of this human form gradually became clear and lucid.Finally \u2026A complete crystal human figure appeared in Lu Sheng\u2019s mind.The body of this crystal humanoid form was filled with black and gray impurities, dying the figure in black giving it an irregular appearance.Lu Sheng\u2019s chest rose and fell, following the rhythm of the Natural Breathing Technique, he continued to breathe.Miraculously, the crystal humanoid in his mind also seemed to be in sync with his body, doing the same breathing exercise.With the crystal figure\u2019s continuous breathing, the black impurities within the crystal figure were gradually expelled.During this process, Lu Sheng clearly felt a refreshing sensation in his brain, and countless memories he had absorbed before, the useless parts were being cleaned out in large quantities.Meanwhile, the useful ones such as martial arts knowledge, insights, techniques, and experiences \u2026 were being sorted out and cleared up.After sorting through all of his memories, Lu Sheng, who had reached a bottleneck in his martial arts cultivation, now had more than ten different types of martial arts paths, including movement techniques, fist techniques, finger techniques, spear techniques, sword techniques, and blade techniques \u2026Lu Sheng had hunted and killed too many zombies, so he had mastered a lot of martial arts techniques.At this time, under the filtering that was taking place in his mind, all these martial arts techniques and skills were steadily and rapidly improving.To state an example, although Lu Sheng previously had obtained the memories of many martial arts techniques, all these were simply stored in his memory. There was no order to rhyme or order to them. They were chaotic and without pattern.Earlier, If Lu Sheng wanted to utilize these techniques and skills, he had to rummage through those disorderly memories.But now, his brain began to actively sort these memories and place theme categories, actively helping Lu Sheng\u2019s body digest and absorb them \u2026If it was said that the countless memories that Lu Sheng obtained in the Dream World were inheritances, then starting from this moment, he had truly inherited the inheritances.Each martial artist has a different path of cultivation according to his or her talent.Some were good at footwork, some are good with their fist, some are good at weapons \u2026No one could practice all aspects of martial arts at the same time, and those that practised several disciplines simultaneously were rare.Because human capacity was limited, how could one person\u2019s strength be all-encompassing? But now, an exception had occurred. The ability to inherit the martial arts of the deceased by absorbing their memories had enabled Lu Sheng to take steps towards an incredible and unprecedented realm. Perhaps one day, it would be possible for a human to emerge who excelled in all forms of martial arts.And that person might be Lu Sheng!\u201cI stand on the shoulders of countless others, all-encompassing, and comprehensive, without flaws or omissions, this is my martial path.\u201d\u201cAbsolute Martial Path!\u201dLu Sheng gazed at the crystal humanoid in his mind that kept breathing and was turning transparent, and thought to himself, \u201cSo, this is the correct way to utilize the Crystal Contemplation Method.\u201dWhen the crystal humanoid in his mind became completely transparent, the memories remaining in Lu Sheng\u2019s mind were also completely sorted out and categorized.\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying \u2026\u201dLu Sheng carefully savoured all the new changes in himself and couldn\u2019t help but feel emotional.After sorting out all of his memories, Lu Sheng now had over ten martial arts techniques that had reached the bottleneck, including movement techniques, palm techniques, finger techniques, spear techniques, sword techniques, and blade techniques \u2026And two of them, namely, body techniques and fist techniques had surpassed the bottleneck. Among them, his fist techniques were infinitely close to a new realm.\u201cEarlier, I was able to achieve ten times the battle prowess (CPI) and BQV during the assessment. Now that I\u2019ve broken through and can generate six times the Stellar Power, along with the breakthrough in my fist techniques, all in all, my battle prowess (CPI) must have multiplied.\u201dSorting through the memories had been immensely helpful.It directly elevated all of his skills and techniques to a new level, and his overall strength had increased significantly.Not only that, after the thorough sorting, Lu Sheng felt his mind become a lot sharper.His cognitive processing speed, aptitude for comprehending and assimilating novel information, and other cognitive abilities have all markedly improved. To say nothing of the miraculous changes that had occurred in certain aspects of his body \u2026[TN Note: LC here.

    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47 \u2014 Spiritual Master, on the High Speed Train\u201c\u2026 There are a total of 96 zombies in the next street, of which 6 are tough ones that need to be dealt with individually \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng closed his eyes and muttered to himself.When he opened his eyes, a strange glow appeared in his eyes. This was a new ability he had obtained after mastering the Crystal Visualisation Method.\u201cI can now detect any objects within a hundred-meters. My vision can pass through the ground, and even through concrete structures \u2026\u201dThis was a very strange ability to have.It gave Lu Sheng the feeling that he had activated his X-ray vision in the game. Within a hundred meters, he could see everything.\u201cWhen used in battle, I can predict the enemy\u2019s movements in advance. My opponent\u2019s pupils, muscles reaction \u2026 I can see the slightest change clearly.\u201d Lu Sheng was excited.He understood that he had entered the most mysterious realm of spiritual power in martial arts cultivation.\u201cThe main purpose of the Crystal Contemplation Method is to cultivate spiritual power. The cultivation of spiritual power is a hundred times more difficult than the cultivation of qi and combat power*. I have a unique condition, which allows me to absorb the memories of zombies.These memory fragments, after being refined and purified by Crystal Contemplation Method, are the best spiritual fuel \u2026 \u201dLu Sheng opened the interface of the Photon Mind he carried with him and entered \u201cspiritual power\u201d as a keyword on it.The result was a huge amount of information.\u201cIt turns out that as early as a hundred years before the martial arts there was the existence of spiritual power, and there are even people who specialize in spiritual power \u2026 Only this kind of person is particularly rare, until the late civilization of the martial dao, a large number of martial arts specifically for the cultivation of spiritual power was developed, the number of such people gradually increased\u2026\u201d\u201cSo spiritual power existed as early as a hundred years before martial cultivation was established. There were even people who specialized in spiritual power \u2026 but these individuals were very rare, and not until the later stage of the martial arts civilization, when numerous martial arts that specialized in spiritual power were developed, did the number of similar individuals increase \u2026\u201dAccording to the information, such people are collectively known as spiritual masters.Like the martial artists, spiritual masters were also divided into many levels.Only that the promotion for a spiritual master was very difficult, and the combat power that could be exerted with each promotion was extremely terrifying.According to the information, a Level 1 Spiritual Master was someone skilled in combat techniques that used spiritual power and could easily handle ten or even more Level 1 Martial Artists, and can even challenge a Level 4 Martial Artist at the extreme end.\u201cIt\u2019s too perverted, it\u2019s almost like a god-level hidden profession in the game \u2026\u201dLu Sheng couldn\u2019t help but sigh.He was curious about his current spiritual strength, but without proper testing apparatuses, it was basically impossible to determine.\u201cFrom the limit of my perception alone, I am now considered a Level 2 Spiritual Master, but I don\u2019t if the same can be said about the strength I can exert \u2026\u201dBase 1359 has special equipments for testing spiritual power, but they were located in the most central command areas of the base. Lu Sheng was probably a dozen or some kilometres away from the base\u2019s central command.Only god knew how many zombies of terrifying strength lurked in between.Although Lu Sheng is the\u00a0spark\u00a0chosen by the civilization, but these zombies did not have any memories of their own, and would try to beat him up, nonetheless.\u201cI can think about it later \u2026\u201dLu Sheng regretfully put aside this thought for the time being, and then searched for the combat techniques suited for spiritual masters through the Photon Mind.The result instead showed \u2013 [Insufficient authority.]\u201cAlright \u2026\u201dLu Sheng was speechless. His Level 2 authority didn\u2019t seem to hold much value in the Fireseed Repository.\u201cI\u2019ll have to get stronger. On the one hand, I can raise my authority to unlock more techniques in the Fireseed Repository, on the other hand, I can also challenge stronger zombies and obtain stronger fragments of memories \u2026\u201dLu Sheng secretly made up his mind.Until then, he could only rely on the Crystal Contemplation Method to generate spiritual power. Of course, he could also try to study and gain insights on it by himself.It would be even better if he could have the luck to take out a zombie that was once spiritual master and inherit its memories.\u2026On the high speed train from Shuhai City to the capital of Dongning Province.On a train, two young men and two young women sat facing each other. All looked young.\u201c\u2026 If it wasn\u2019t for my parents forcing me to go to this cram school, saying that the instructor was a peak Level 5 Martial Artist who had retired from the Extreme Martial Arts School, I really wouldn\u2019t want to go.\u201cAnyway, my BQV has already exceeded 1.3, easily reaching the standards of a Level 1 Martial Artist before the college entrance examination \u2026\u201cBut if it makes me stronger, why not go? What do you guys think? \u2026\u201d An average looking boy wearing designer clothes kept chattering away, and a round-faced girl, wearing glasses, sitting across him kept nodding her head, with a hint of admiration.On the other hand, the girl sitting in the seat next to him was indifferent and had a cold expression on her. Her eyes flashed with annoyance from time to time.Li Yihan was almost annoyed to death by the boy beside her who was constantly showing off his superiority with every word he spoke.It seemed that the boy considered having a BQV of 1.3 and enrolling in a cram school run by a Level 5 Martial Artist was very impressive.If the other party had not taken the initiative to spew out all the details, and she had stumbled upon the information, she might\u2019ve even viewed differently. But kept showing off over and over again, make her disgust for him only multiply.That said, Li Yihan was too embarrassed to ask the guy to just shut up. She could only endure in silence.But even if she had encountered such an obnoxious fly, Li Yihan did not regret this trip too much.The reason being \u2026 the good-looking guy sitting directly across from her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 \u2013 Where is Your Designated Car?The boy had caught the train together with Li Yihan and was sitting opposite to her. He looked about the same age as her. He was sleeping with his head lightly propped against the window.Li Yihan could look at him unrestrainedly because of this.The boy had a very fair complexion, with a very delicate skin texture, but he was unlike those boys with effeminate features that girls usually liked.He had the facial contours and features that were very hard and masculine. He had a high nose, with a deep and sharp set of eyebrows, giving him a chiselled look.Furthermore, he was just her type.It was the presence of this boy that made Li Yihan endure the incessant chatter of the \u201cfly\u201d next to her and kept her from changing seats.Just as Li Yihan quietly admiring the boy\u2019s handsome face, the high-speed train shook slightly, and the man leaning on the window opened his eyes slowly.Li Yihan originally intended to immediately look away, but the other party\u2019s eyes had taken hold of her attention.What kind of eyes are those?Li Yihan swore that it was the first time she had ever seen such beautiful eyes in her entire life. They were clear as crystals, without a single blemish, and were as deep as the starry sky. There also was this strange glow in the centre of his pupils.The boy\u2019s eyes were like two black vortexes that sucked Li Yihan\u2019s mind slowly in to them.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dLi Yihan snapped back to her senses and suddenly found that the handsome boy had come up to her and asked her if she was doing fine.\u201cAh \u2026 I\u2019m fine, it\u2019s nothing. I got lost in thought \u2026\u201dLi Yihan\u2019s pretty face instantly turned red as she tried to explain herself in a panic, feeling her ears burning.It\u2019s embarrassing! Being caught staring at him like that. He won\u2019t think of me as some kind of love struck idiot, right \u2026Li Yihan wailed in her heart, wishing that the ground beneath her feet would crack open and bury her inside.\u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re okay.\u201d Lu Sheng breathed a sigh of relief.He had just got out of the dream world, and the spiritual power he was cultivating hadn\u2019t had time to fully retract, so he didn\u2019t know what effect it would have on ordinary people.\u201cHello, my name is Huang Yuan, we were just chatting, are you by any chance from Shuhai?\u201dThe round-faced girl sitting next to him took the initiative to greet Lu Sheng, temporarily relieving Li Yihan\u2019s embarrassment.Lu Sheng was really comfortable with impromptu meetings and conversations like this, but he still shook his head and politely said, \u201cMy name is Lu Sheng, I\u2019m not from Shuhai, I\u2019m from Baihe, a city near to Shuhai.\u201d\u201cNo wonder, you don\u2019t sound like someone from Shuhai.\u201dThe boy next to Li Yihan also struck up a conversation, \u201cMy name is Liu Feng, I go to Shuehai First High School, my BQV is 1.3.\u201dWith the last sentence, the boy called Liu Feng unconsciously raised his chin, revealing a faint look of pride.Regarding people like this, who constantly kept talking about their Blood Qi Values, Lu Sheng though they were no different from those who wear thick gold chains around their necks, afraid that others won\u2019t know they\u2019re nouveau riche.But out of politeness, Lu Sheng still nodded at the other party.Hearing this, Li Yihan also recovered, she blushed and whispered, \u201cMy name is Li Yihan, from Shuhai Second High School.\u201d\u201cHaha, then we were really destined to meet today. We are about the same age, and also happen to be taking the same train to the provincial capital of Dongning.\u201dLiu Feng said, smilingly, \u201cWhat are you guys going to Dongning for? I am going there to attend cram school. An old instructor who\u2019s also a Level 5 Martial Artist will coach when I get there. It is said that he\u2019s taught top students of several cities \u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLu Sheng forced to hold back his speechlessness several times, but he answered honestly, \u201cI am going to a attend a training camp in Dongning. I was Shuhai for some business.\u201dLi Yihan and Huang Yuan also told their respective purposes.In fact, the four of them had similar goals. They were either going to cram school or go for special training. After all, they were close to the college entrance examination and were all worried about their BQV scores.In the following conversation, Liu Feng naturally took over the lead. He seemed to have some special interest in Li Yihan and had been trying to get her attention.Of course, his tactics were so poor and clumsy that even Lu Sheng couldn\u2019t bear to look at him, let alone Li Yihan.The most innocent of the four, Huang Yuan, though, listened with great interest, and from time to time let out noises of \u00a0admiration.Since the train would arrive at the station any time soon, he couldn\u2019t close his eyes and enter the dream world, so Lu Sheng felt quite bored.He could only listen to Liu Feng\u2019s endless bragging, staring at Li Yihan sitting opposite him, imagining in his heart that at this moment Li Yihan\u2019s good feeling for Liu Feng was constantly popping up on his head \u201c-1\u201d \u201c-1\u2033\u2026He could only listen to Liu Feng\u2019s endless bragging and stare at Li Yihan who was sitting opposite him. As time went on, he imagined Liu Feng\u2019s favorability in Li Yihan eyes must\u2019ve something like this:\u201c-1\u201d\u201c-1\u201d\u201c-1\u201d\u201c-1\u201dFinally, along with the pleasant beep, the high speed train arrived at the station.Dongning City, the capital of Dongning Province.\u201cWhew \u2026\u201dStepping off the train, Lu Sheng exhaled a long breath.The train was too stuffy, and it wasn\u2019t comfortable sitting in it for too long.\u201cYihan, are you taking a taxi? My cram school has sent a special car to pick me up. Oh, I can let the car drop you off on the way.\u201dNext to him, Liu Feng, who got off the car, continued to court Li Yihan, and he even tried to take care of Lu Sheng and Huang Yuan at the same time.\u201cYou two are also welcome.\u201dThough he sounded very reluctant when he looked at them.Li Yihan didn\u2019t appreciate it and decisively refused, \u201cIt\u2019s too troublesome. There\u2019s no need.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not troublesome, Yihan. Why don\u2019t we add each other on WeChat first \u2026\u201dFollowing that, Lu Sheng and Huang Yuan watched as Liu Feng walked out of the station like a bootlicker chasing after a goddess in a third-rate idol drama.The four walked to the entrance of the high speed railway station, where there were many private cars, and cabs were parked, as well as a few buses.One of them was a business class bus with a unique shape and an eye-catching \u201cGenius Training Camp\u201d banner on it.In order to show off his knowledge, Liu Feng took the initiative to say to Lu Sheng and others: \u201cSee that bus? If I\u2019m not wrong, that bus should be the special bus prepared for the Genius Training Camp students hosted by the Dongning Provincial Government \u2026\u201dHuang Yuan next to him asked curiously, \u201cWhat is the Genius Training Camp?\u201dLiu Feng shook his head: \u201cI\u2019m not too sure, I only know that it\u2019s a very powerful training camp that gathers all the martial arts geniuses of the entire Dongning Province. No more than ten students can participate for each city.\u201cThere is a bigshot I know from the next to mine, back in school. His BQV had already reached 1.5, meeting the qualification for a Level 1 Martial Artist. Even so, he didn\u2019t even qualify for the training camp.\u201dLiu Feng sighed sincerely and said in an extremely envious tone. \u201cIn short, those who can enter this training camp are the top geniuses. They\u2019re god-like figures \u2026\u201d\u201cWow \u2026\u201dHuang Yuan let out a loud exclamation.Even Li Yihan seemed interested, with a curious look on her face.At the same time, Liu Feng glanced at Lu Sheng who was standing on the side, and seeing as he had no change in expression, his heart skipped a beat.\u201cLu Sheng, you are here to participate in a training camp right? Where is your designated car?\u201dRight on the heels of the introducing the Prodigy Training Camp, he had asked Lu Sheng about his own training camp. There was no hiding the ridicule behind the question.Liu Feng had done it on purpose.Who let this kid called Lu Sheng be so handsome, making the beautiful Li Yihan secretly steal glances at him all throughout the ride.See if I don\u2019t stink you up a bit.*[*a very crude equivalent of tit-for-tat in this context.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 \u2014 My Car Has ArrivedBefore Lu Sheng could speak, Li Yihan said with a frown: \u201cYou think it\u2019s funny, Liu Feng? Deliberately disgusting people like that.\u201dLiu Feng hurriedly explained in a playful tone: \u201cNo, I wascasually asking how Lu Sheng would leave. If he doesn\u2019t have a vehicle designated to him, I was thinking of asking my cram school to drop him off \u2026\u201dLi Yihan was disgusted.Lu Sheng, who had been quite all the while, spoke up: \u201cThere\u2019s no need. The training camp\u2019s vehicle is already here.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d Liu Feng froze, not expecting such a reply from Lu Sheng.\u201cWhere is it? Lu Sheng I\u2019ll go with you if can give me a ride.\u201d Li Yihan spoke quickly, as if specifically to show her support for Lu Sheng, and incidentally gave Liu Feng a fierce glare.Lu Sheng frowned and thought for a moment, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s okay, I have to ask first.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright, I\u2019ll wait for you!\u201d Li Yihan looked like she was dead set on it.On the side, Liu Feng was about to turn green in anger. He had made a fool out of himself.No matter how slow Huang Yuan\u2019s brain was, she also realized that there was a conflict going on between Liu Feng and Lu Sheng.On the one hand, she thought of Lu Sheng as a good person, handsome and good-tempered, on the other hand, she wants to get in Liu Feng\u2019s car.She hesitated for a while, unable to come to a decision.The three soon noticed that Lu Sheng had walked off and quickly moving in a direction.It looked like he was looking for a car.\u201cThis kid really has a designated car to pick him up \u2026\u201d Liu Feng said hatefully, but halfway through his sentence, he suddenly got stuck.Not only him, Li Yihan and Huang Yuan also froze, and their eyes shot wide open.Only to see, Lu Sheng walked straight towards the special business class bus from the Prodigy Training Camp, which they had just discussed earlier, and which was defined in Liu Feng\u2019s mouth as simply awesome, and that which only geniuses could attend.They saw Lu Sheng walk to that bus, when a man got down from it, the two of them talked for a while, and then Lu Sheng walked back slowly.\u201cLet\u2019s go, the teacher leading the team agreed.\u201dLu Sheng calmly invited Li Yihan and Huang Yuan along with him, \u201cHuang Yuan should come along too.\u201dLi Yihan nodded in a daze, then followed behind Lu Sheng.Huang Yuan, with a shocked and exaggerated expression, also quickly followed behind.Among the four, only one Liu Feng was left standing dumbfounded, Lu Sheng didn\u2019t even give him a second glance.\u201cFuck!\u201dLiu Feng suddenly came back to his senses and cried out in disbelief, \u201cIt\u2019s fake! Are you trying to act cool in front of me? Let\u2019s see how you\u2019re going to get kicked out of the \u2026\u201dThen, as he watched, Lu Sheng took Li Yihan and Huang Yuan and the two of them smoothly got into the uniquely shaped business class bus with the \u201cGenius Training Camp\u201d banner.The door of the bus quickly closed, and then they were on their way. The whole process was incredibly smooth, without any interruptions or incidents. There was no drama unfurling like Liu Feng was expecting to happen.Liu Feng was completely dumbfounded.He was wondering many there was some other training camp named \u201cGenius Training Camp\u201d in Dongning, and Lu Sheng attending it.But unfortunately, Liu Feng once seen the real \u201cGenius Training Camp\u201d pick up students, right in front of the Shuhai Martial Arts Association, and it was the exact same kind of vehicle that Lu Sheng was on.So that could only mean \u2026He had just bragged to a genius who was qualified to participate in the Dongning province\u2019s Martial Arts Prodigy Training Camp, and he had even gone out of his way to embarrass him before he left?Liu Feng is confused.\u2026Even after she sat down in the bus and drove away, Li Yihan was still in disbelief.Just a minute ago, Liu Feng was still talking about how awesome the Prodigy Training Camp was, and how awesome the person who could get into the training camp and get into the car must be.But the next minute, Lu Sheng led her up the bus. It was as casual as getting on a bus in front of her house. The whole process was so strange that it felt like a dream.Huang Yuan felt the same way as her, but her reaction was way more exaggerated. Her eyes were still wide open, and her face was full of shock.Lu Sheng, on the other hand, was as calm as ever. After getting into the car, he faced the window and quietly looked at the scenery outside.It had to be said that the privileges the Prodigy Training Camp gave were pretty good.The vehicle picking him up was a special business class vanity bus.There was no one other than the three of them in the vanity bus. There was only a driver in white gloves who was focused on driving.During their ride, he specifically asked Li Yihan and Huang Yuan about their destinations, and then dropped them to their locations, one by one.\u201cLu Sheng \u2026\u201d Before getting off, Li Yihan bit her lips, hesitating whether she should ask Lu Sheng for a contact. But before she could muster the courage to ask, Lu Sheng was already waving goodbye to her.Looking at the slowly moving bus, Li Yihan suddenly felt empty inside. She had a strong feeling that after this, she would probably never see Lu Sheng again in her life.The transparent windows reflected Lu Sheng\u2019s clean and handsome side profile. As the bus window remained crystal clear, it cast a reflection of Lu Sheng\u2019s immaculate and attractive side profile, continuing to gleam with the same radiance as always in the eyes of Li Yihan.But Li Yihan knew very well how big of a gap existed between her and Lu Sheng. It was like two completely different worlds on and off the car.She was like a commoner girl who had accidentally barged into a prince\u2019s ball. After having a wonderful time, she was destined to return to reality \u2026\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d As the car slowly came to a stop, the driver turned to remind Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng nodded and stepped off the bus with his suitcase in tow.In front of him was a huge, heavily guarded military base.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 \u2014 Connections and Entrance ExaminationBoth sides of the base were blocked by tall electrified iron wire fenced walls, and in front of them was a large iron gate that was tightly shut.There are soldiers in uniform standing guard at the gate.There were also a dozen or so young boys and girls who looked about the same age as Lu Sheng. They were also carrying suitcases of various sizes.Lu Sheng noticed that all of these people were wearing a brass-colored badge on their left chests.Level 1 Martial Artists.It was a pity that Lu Sheng\u2019s Level 2 Martial Artist badge was left at home and was kept by his mother, Zheng Yufen. Who thought of it as some kind of treasure. Otherwise, he could have taken it out to show off.\u201cParticipant from Baihe City has arrived.\u201d The driver said a sentence, then started the car turned around and drove away.The group of boys and girls stared at Lu Sheng and started to whisper among themselves.\u201cSomeone from Baihe city? Didn\u2019t they already go in earlier? How come one person was left behind?\u201d\u201cProbably someone who came in later, can\u2019t you see that he hasn\u2019t even cleared the Martial Artist Assessment? Baihe City has always been at the bottom of the province in terms of academic results.\u201d\u201cOh \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng listened to these discussions with a calm expression, his heart as still as water.With his current strength, even if all of these little brats who had just reached the standard of official Level 1 Martial Artists were to attack him together, they would still not be his match.Towards these people who were far weaker than him and didn\u2019t have any sense of discernment, he felt that it was beneath him to even look at them.After waiting for a while, a small door under the main gate of the base opened from the inside. A middle-aged man in military uniform with a square face and a serious look walked out.He took the roster and counted the number of people present, and finally his eyes fell on Lu Sheng.\u201cYou are \u2026\u201dThe middle-aged man looked down at the roster again and raised his head, \u201cThe Lu Sheng, that Xiao Yuhe, the president of the Baihe Martial Arts Association, mentioned?\u201dLu Sheng nodded his head.The middle-aged man understood.President Xiao Yuhe of the Baihe Martial Arts Association specifically mentioned to him that there was a student who did not come by the designated vehicle, and had asked him to pay attention to him.*[* It refers to the vehicle sent to Baihe City. Lu Sheng was picked up in the designated bus in the capital of Dongning Province where the camp is to be held.]Now the person in question had arrived.The middle-aged man purposely mentioned it, but when it fell into the ears of the other boys and girls present, they saw it in a completely different light.\u201cSo it\u2019s someone that the president of Baihe City\u2019s Martial Arts Association specially took care of \u2026\u201d\u201cNo wonder \u2026\u201d\u201cImpressive. You have connections with the president of a city\u2019s Martial Arts Association \u2026\u201d Someone said sarcastically.Lu Sheng was fine with it, but the middle-aged man in military uniform raised his eyebrows and shouted, \u201cSilence, everyone!\u201dA group immediately shut their mouths.The middle-aged man counted the number of people again and confirmed that there were no problems. Then, he said to Lu Sheng, \u201cThen you can enter with the group from Qingyuan City. Go in for your induction ceremony.\u201dThe others didn\u2019t think much of it, but Lu Sheng sensed something different from his words.Enter as a group?\u00a0What does he mean by that? Could it be that this so-called induction ceremony had to be done in group?However, even if he felt that something was off, Lu Sheng still obediently followed behind the group and entered the base under the guidance of the middle-aged man.Once inside, there was a large field with many buildings surrounding it at a distance.The middle-aged man led them around the field and finally brought them to a short building.\u201cPut down your luggage. Someone will hand it to you, later.\u201d The middle-aged man gave the order indifferently.He pointed at a small door in front of the building and said, \u201cGo in one by one.\u201dThe students from Qingyuan City didn\u2019t know what was going on, but they still obediently followed the middle-aged man\u2019s instructions and walked through the small door one by one.Lu Sheng was the last in line.When all of them entered the small door, the iron door behind them closed heavily with a clang. They could hear sounds of iron chains moving, and felt the door being locked up.The group underwent a change in emotion. Simultaneously, they heard the voice of the middle-aged man: \u201cWalk to the exit on the other side, and you\u2019ll clear the entrance examination. If you can\u2019t \u2026 Hmph. You can go back to where you came from!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Someone immediately shouted, \u201cWasn\u2019t this supposed to be an induction ceremony? Why is there an examination \u2026\u201dBefore he could finish his sentence, they all heard the sounds of cogs spinning and machines moving. The floor of the small room cracked open in the middle.The group of boys and girls lost their balance and fell down while screaming.Lu Sheng, however, had detected it before the mechanism even activated.To be precise, the second Lu Sheng stepped into this room, he already knew that there was a mechanism hidden beneath the floor, and that there was a narrow and complicated passaged underground.Bang!Bang-Bang!!The sound of bodies landing on the ground, accompanied by a few slight groans of slight pain rang out around him.The boys and girls landed on their feet, one after another. After all, they were all official Level 1 Martial Artists. Even if they were caught off guard, most of them reacted quickly after the mechanism was activated.Only a few were still too panicked, and landed on their backs and butts.Lu Sheng landed steadily on the ground, without even making a sound.His spiritual power wrapped around his feet like water, andthen provided a cushioning force. The way it would look like would be more akin to floating.This was one of the ways of using spiritual power that Lu Sheng has worked out in the dream world.Although he could not learn specialized spiritual power manipulation techniques, Lu Sheng still researched some small uses of spiritual powerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 \u2014 Beasts Tread Alone, While Cattle Herd TogetherSpirituality as \u201ceyes\u201d, a hundred meters in all directions without dead angle detection, open \u201cperspective hanging\u201d This is the basic role. Using X-ray vision was a basic functionality now.Then he spread the spiritual power throughout the surface of his body.For example, the spiritual power focussed on the legs, could not only reduce the resistance from air, but also generate propulsion force, greatly increase his speed. He could also an achieve an effect similar to making him weightless.Lu Sheng estimated that if his spiritual power was strong enough to a certain extent, he could even rely solely on it to levitate!When the same spiritual energy was concentrated on his fist, it could enhance his explosive power to a certain extent.But it could also be used without augmenting his body parts. Lu Sheng had tried it before, and he could completely rely on his spiritual power to lift a heavy object of about 20 kilograms.This was almost equivalent to the \u201ctelekinesis\u201d described in novels. There were also people who simply used their spiritual power to thrash people.Lu Sheng had tried to attack zombies in the dream world using just his spiritual power, but the results weren\u2019t ideal. Still, considering how the zombies were rendered nearly unconscious immediately, the power it could generate was much stronger than he had previously anticipated.In short, spiritual power was like a panacea for Lu Sheng. It could be used everywhere, and was effective every time. It could not get any better.At this moment, what appeared in front of everyone was a sealed passage with four walls made of pure steel plates. It was about two meters wide and could accommodate four people walking side by side.Someone reached out and knocked on the wall, and a dull ringing sound came from within the wall.Their expressions doured at that.This proved that the surrounding walls were much thicker than they had thought.Lu Sheng just stood in the corner watching the group of teenagers conducting various experiments, in fact, he had already scouted everything underneath the moment he had entered the space.The steel plates on the walls were more than 50 centimetres thick, and there was a concrete wall behind the steel plates. Basically, there was only one way to go.In addition, there were some unexpected contraptions hidden in the wall. Of course, these teenagers needed to discover those by themselves.\u201cFrom the looks of it, this is the so-called induction ceremony.\u201dAmong the students from Qingyuan City, there was a tall, thin, and handsome boy with a proud expression on his face. He sneered and said, \u201cI thought it would be something special, so it\u2019s just this? So boring.\u201dSomeone shouted, \u201cLin Shaoyu, did you already know that there was something fishy about the induction ceremony?Fuck, why didn\u2019t you remind everyone about it earlier? I fell down on my butt, and it hurts so much that I feel its going to split!\u201dThe boy called Lin Shaoyu glanced at him in disdain and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t even have the ability to adapt to the situation, and you still have the nerve to call yourself an official martial artist?\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d The youth who was ridiculed had a look of shame and anger on his face, but he didn\u2019t dare to do anything.\u201cAlright, stop arguing. We are all from the same city, and it wasn\u2019t easy for us to get into this training camp. None of us want to be eliminated. Let\u2019s hurry up and think of a way to clear this test.\u201dA tall and sweet-looking girl came out to smooth things over.\u201cWhat can we do? We can keep moving forward.\u201d Someone said, \u201cDidn\u2019t the person who led us in just now say that we can clear the examination if we reach the exit?\u201d\u201cIf we stick together, we will definitely be able to pass the subsequent tests. After all, we have ten Level 1 Martial Artists.\u201dSuddenly, someone pointed at Lu Sheng in the corner and said, \u201cWhat about this guy? He\u2019s not from Qingyuan City.\u201dSuddenly, all eyes landed on Lu Sheng. These people stared at Lu Sheng, and their expressions gradually became playful.\u201cJust in time. Since we don\u2019t know what dangers lie ahead, we can use him to test out the way ahead.\u201d Someone suggested.Immediately someone echoed.\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea.\u201dThe pretty girl from earlier was reluctant, \u201cThis \u2026 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. He\u2019s here to participate in the training, just like us \u2026\u201dThe boy called Lin Shaoyu smiled and reassured her, \u201cWhat does it matter, people like him who came in through connections and didn\u2019t even pass the level 1 official martial artist test, even if they enter the training camp, they will be eliminated out in a few days.The boy called Lin Shaoyu smiled and comforted her, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. People like him who rely on connections to get in and didn\u2019t even clear the Martial Arts Assessment will be eliminated in a few days even if he enters the training camp. It doesn\u2019t matter \u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dLu Sheng listened in amusement on the side and shook his head and stood out.\u201cYo, you\u2019re quite proactive.\u201dLin Shaoyu nodded and said, \u201cKid from Baihe City, if you behave well, we might consider giving you a hand and let you follow behind us later.\u201dLu Sheng smiled with a calm face and said indifferently: \u201cBeasts tread alone, while cattle herd together.\u201dAfter saying that, Lu Sheng walked towards the passage without looking back.They were stunned.Lin Shaoyu quickly reacted and a look of shame and anger appeared on his face.\u201cFuck, how dare you call me cattle?!\u201dLin Shaoyu rushed forward, raised his fist, and tried to punch Lu Sheng from behind.At this moment, the steel plates on both sides of the passage between Lin Shaoyu and Lu Sheng suddenly shrank, and a black shadow emerged from the wall.Lin Shaoyu jumped and retracted his body.Immediately after, as if it was some kind of chain reaction was triggered. Sounds of a series of mechanical clicks and cogs of machines running could be heard behind the steel plated wall, and a many black shadows scurried about one after another.In just a few seconds, the originally empty passageway was filled with tall and burly figures.There were black shadows of burly figures blocking their way every few meters, and there was only so much gap left between them.When the group from the Qingyuan City saw the black shadow\u2019s appearance, their expressions changed.Someone blurted out.\u201cMechanical puppets!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52 \u2013 Fuck, It\u2019s a Level 2!!Each of the shadows that appeared in the tunnel was nearly two meters tall.The puppets had long arms and legs, and had smooth glossy surfaces. Other than a pair of eyes that glowed with a faint red light, it had no facial features.They were made of an unknown dark yellow alloy, with thick rubber covers on their joints, giving them an incredibly heavy and sturdy feeling of security.Of course, if there was a black mass standing in front of you, it would be very difficult to deal with them. This sense of security instantly turned into a sense of oppression.The teenagers from Qingyuan City were the same.They all had unsightly expressions on their faces, even Lin Shaoyu was the same. They looked like they had chewed on a fly.\u201cEven the weakest of the mechanical puppets is stronger than a Level 1 Martial Artist. There are so many of them here. Is the training camp trying to kill us?\u201d\u201cFuck! This place is so cramped there\u2019s nowhere to run!\u201d\u201cWhat should I do \u2026\u201d Although he had detected them in his spiritual perception, Lu Sheng still felt a little strange looking at them standing in front of him.The mechanical puppets were actually a kind of martial arts puppets named after the mechanical wooden puppets that were popular in the ancient martial arts era.It was the product of the combination of modern technology and martial arts.The bodies of these mechanical puppets were completely manufactured by modern industry, but their brains were stored with all kinds of high-level programs that contained all kinds of martial arts moves.Once it was activated, it could display the combat power of an official martial artist.Lu Sheng had only seen such things on television before.Some wealthy families would purchase these mechanical puppets as bodyguards, and some high-class academies would use these mechanical puppets as sparring partners.It was said that the highest grade mechanical puppet was comparable to a Level 4 Martial Artist, but the cost of producing one was much higher than the cost of nurturing a Level 4 Martial Artist.This was the first time Lu Sheng had seen such a high-end product, so he couldn\u2019t help but be curious. He moved closer to take a closer look.\u201cIdiot!\u201dLin Shaoyu, who saw this scene from behind, revealed a speechless expression. He said, \u201cThis country bumpkin from Baihe has probably never seen a mechanical puppet before. These mechanical puppets that have their restrictions lifted would immediately attack once they sensed a moving object approaching.\u201cA Level 1 Mechanical Puppet made from a special alloy, and its fists were extremely hard. A single punch could cause a Level 1 Martial Artist to bleed internally.\u201cA Level 1 Mechanical Puppet, made from special alloy, have extremely hard fists and body. A single punch can cause a Level 1 Martial Artist to bleed internally.\u201cThis brat isn\u2019t even a Level 1 Martial Artist, yet he still dares to stick his head out. I reckon he\u2019s going to get a concussion \u2026\u201dThe others were looking at him in schadenfreude, as if they were awaiting a good show.Only the sweet-looking girl had a worried expression. She opened her mouth, wanting to warn Lu Sheng, but was afraid of attracting the attention of the mechanical puppets.Just as Lin Shaoyu said, Lu Sheng took two steps forward.The red light in the eyes of the two mechanical puppets flashed, and they raised their fists at the same time, fiercely striking towards him.\u201cHmph \u2026\u201dLin Shaoyu crossed his arms in front of his chest, a mocking look on his face.Previously, when Lu Sheng called him cattle, he was worried that he would not be able to teach Lu Sheng a lesson. Now that Lu Sheng was in trouble, he was happier than anyone else.\u201cBe careful!\u201dThe sweet-looking girl couldn\u2019t help but cry out.Just when everyone thought they were about to see a horrible scene, what happened in the next second made them all widen their eyes.Bang!Bang!There were two muffled sounds.Two dark alloy fists the size of bowls were firmly grasped by a fair and slender hand, one on the left and one on the right.During this process, Lu Sheng\u2019s body did not even sway or waver.\u201cHe actually \u2026 actually caught it \u2026\u201dThe youths from Qingyuan City had an incredulous expression on their faces.Lin Shaoyu, who had his arms crossed, was also stunned. He suddenly stood up straight, wondering if he had seen wrongly.Level 1 Mechanical Puppets had alloy skin and iron skeletal system, and their CPI was close to 1000. They also had basic martial arts techniques inbuilt in to them, and in actual combat, they could completely crush most Level 1 Martial Artists.Even some Level 2 martial artists might not be able to suppress them.After all, they were machines, not humans, and would not get tired or hurt.Although Lin Shaoyu had always been very confident, he knew that he would never dare to directly receive fist of a Level 1 Mechanical Puppet.With the obvious difference in strength, wouldn\u2019t he be looking for a beating?But now, he actually saw a student from Baihe City who had entered through connections, and whose strength had not even reached Level 1 \u2026He had actually used his palms to receive the full-powered attacks of the puppet head-on.This scene was even more shocking than seeing the old man selling cr\u00eapes downstairs suddenly jump three meters into the air and transform into a martial arts expert.Just when Lin Shaoyu and the youths from Qingyuan City were in a daze, an even more shocking scene occurred.Creak-creak!A teeth-numbing sound of straining machines rang out.The youths widened their eyes as they watched.The arms of the two mechanical puppets were slowly being lifted by a pair of fair palms.Because the mechanical parts clashed with the program\u2019s instructions, the joints of the mechanical puppets\u2019 arms emitted large amounts of sparks, accompanied by ear-piercing sounds.\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d Someone\u2019s mouth was wide open as he let out an incredulous cry. \u201cThis guy has a strength greater than a Level 1 Mechanical Puppet \u2026 Is he still human?\u201dThe others were also shocked, and could not find the words to describe their feelings.The sweet-looking girl had already covered her mouth with her hands, and her round eyes were filled with shock and astonishment.\u201cHahaha \u2026\u201dAt this time, a peal of laughter suddenly rang out.Everyone looked towards the source of the sound, and saw Lin Shaoyu laughing loudly. He shook his head and said self-deprecatingly, \u201cI was almost fooled by the people from the training camp.\u201cHow are these Level 1 Mechanical Puppets? They are clearly underperforming products that are not even Level 1. Their actual CPI is far from a real Level 1, and they are only trying to bluff us through their stature \u2026\u201cThis should be the case, if there were truly so many Level 1 Mechanical Puppets here, how could anyone clear the test!\u201dLin Shaoyu pointed at Lu Sheng, who was still calm as he stopped the two mechanical puppets, causing sparks to fly everywhere. With an exaggerated expression, he shouted at everyone, \u201cDo you guys really think that this guy, who took a backdoor entry to the camp, and isn\u2019t even a Level 1 Martial Artist could withstand the attacks of two Level 1 Mechanical Puppets, simultaneously?\u201dThe youths blinked their eyes, and their expressions were a little confused. It was obvious that they could not follow Lin Shaoyu\u2019s train of thought.\u201cForget it, it\u2019s hard to explain to a bunch of idiots like you \u2026\u201d Lin Shaoyu waved his hand in defeat, and slowly moved forward.\u201cIf you don\u2019t understand, then open your eyes wide and watch how I clear the test.\u201dLin Shaoyu flicked his hair, and suddenly sped up, and then confidently rushed towards the two mechanical puppets in front of him.Lin Shaoyu\u2019s figure was as fast as an arrow, and in the blink of an eye, he was in front of the two mechanical puppets.The eyes of the two mechanical puppets that were silent suddenly glowed red.At the same time, they punched out.Bam!A figure suddenly flew back, and with a \u201cBam\u201d and heavily smashed into the innermost wall.Lin Shaoyu\u2019s body slowly slid down the wall like a rag cloth, and his expression twitched. He slowly raised a hand as if he wanted to grab something.\u201cFuck \u2026 This is not a Level 1 Mechanical Puppet, it\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s a fucking Level 2!\u201d After saying this, Lin Shaoyu\u2019s head dropped, and he directly fainted.The others saw everything that happened in a flash, and their mouths started to open bit by bit, and their expressions were so shocked that they could not say a word.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 \u2013 Where did this Level 2 Come From?!\u201cIt\u2019s internal structure is far more complicated than I imagined it to be \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s spiritual power probed into the mechanical puppet\u2019s body. After carefully studying it for a while, he quickly lost interest.He abruptly released the fists of the two mechanical puppets he was holding.The two mechanical arms, that had been in a state of conflict between the program instruction and mechanical execution, finally reached their limit under the sudden release which caused an overload in the circuits of the puppet.With a \u201ccrash\u201d, a mechanical arm was directly torn off from one of the puppet\u2019s shoulder joints.\u201cHis strength is almost on par with a Level 2 Martial Artist \u2026\u201dLu Sheng did not need to turn his head to know what was happening behind him. Naturally, he was aware of Lin Shaoyu\u2019s miserable state.He did not know what was wrong with that fellow\u2019s brain, to actually dare to learn from him and fight against two Level 2 Mechanical Puppets head on, where did he get his confidence from?\u201cLet\u2019s try defending again.\u201d The mechanical puppet that had lost an arm did not seem to have any intention of stopping. It continued to raise its remaining arm and smashed down fiercely at Lu Sheng.But to Lu Sheng, the attack was a bit too slow.Lu Sheng only tilted his head to the side, and he easily dodged the arms of the two mechanism puppets.Then \u2026 He punched out.Boom!This punch landed heavily on the chest of one of the mechanical puppets. The thick alloy chest let out an ear-piercing sound of steel rupturing, and then it quickly caved in.Bang!A large cluster of sparks burst out.A large hole appeared on the back of the mechanical puppet, and a fair and powerful fist came through it.Lu Sheng casually pulled his fist out of the puppet\u2019s body and blocked another puppet\u2019s attack while he was at it.The red light in the eyes of the nearly two-meter tall mechanical puppet flickered for a moment before gradually extinguishing. Then, it swayed and fell down, letting out a dull thud.Boom!The group from Qingyuan City, who were still standing at the entrance of the passageway, had a huge emotional shock and trembled violently.It was too terrifying.This was the only thought they had for Lu Sheng.Seeing how Lu Sheng easily dealt with the two mechanical puppets, the youths suddenly recalled what Lu Sheng had said earlier.\u201cBeasts tread alone, while cattle herd together.\u201dCompared to the current Lu Sheng, these people who were trembling in front of the mechanical puppets were indeed like a herd of frightened cattle.Lu Sheng\u2019s upright, tall, and lean figure, quickly became imposing in their eyes. Clearly, the other party was only a youth about the same age as them.Bang!Boom!\u2026A series of loud noises reverberated in the narrow passageway, and the eyelids of the youths couldn\u2019t help but twitch.Monster!The youths couldn\u2019t find a more suitable word to describe the figure in the distance. Looking at the mechanical puppets that had fallen to the ground like scrap metal, the hearts of the youths were wailing.This was a genuine Level 2 Mechanical Puppet!Level 2!Not Level 1!It wasn\u2019t a half-finished product, either!Evidence could be found just by looking at Lin Shaoyu, who was lying on the ground in a near-death state.In Lu Sheng\u2019s hands, these impenetrable existences were as fragile as scarecrows stuck in a wheat field.At this moment, these youths from Qingyuan City, who had been praised by countless people as geniuses, monsters, but they finally began to see reality.They finally understood what kinda of existences these actually geniuses and monsters were like.Why did they have to let mere mortals like them be in the same training camp as these monsters?Mom, I want to go home!\u2026Lu Sheng knocked down each and every mechanical puppet in front of him one by one. With his spiritual power, he could inspect the internal structure of these mechanical puppets, and easily find the core of each mechanical puppet.Then attack their weak points.It was very easy.He didn\u2019t even need a second hit to knock down each mechanical puppet. Just as Lu Sheng crushed the skull of a mechanical puppet, his expression suddenly changed.He could clearly \u201csee\u201d that, in front of the passageway, there was a figure rapidly approaching him. Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes lit up slightly, and a look of anticipation appeared on his face.\u201cHas the second test finally begun? You\u2019ve made me wait for too long \u2026\u201d\u2026At the same time, a handsome youth with a mole hidden in his left eyebrow was rushing through the passageway. He held something that looked like a remote control tightly in his hand.There were more than ten buttons on the remote control, and above each button was a corresponding green light. At this moment, the ten green lights on the remote control in the youth\u2019s hand were rapidly turning red one after another.In just a few minutes, more than eighty percent of the green lights turned red. Looking at the blinding red lights, the youth\u2019s face filled with anxiety.\u201cFuck! Fuck! Fuck! What\u2019s going on?! Why are all the mechanical puppets malfunctioning all of a sudden? Didn\u2019t they that just arrive? \u2026\u201d The youth was burning with anxiety.As the person in charge of this passageway, not only was he responsible for the safety of the youths, but he was also responsible for the wear and tear of the mechanical puppets in the passageway.Generally speaking, as long as the mechanical puppets were not completely damaged, everything would be fine.How much could a group of kids who had just reached the standard of a Level 1 Martial Artist damage a Level 2 Mechanical Puppet?Was that even possible?Even if they used all their tricks and knowledge, they would probably only be able to break the paint on the mechanical puppet\u2019s outer shell.Therefore, the youth was relieved and hid at the side for a while, preparing to come out and save the day when it was about time.After all, the real purpose of this assessment was to crush the arrogance of this group of so-called \u201ctop geniuses of Dongning Province\u201d so that they would remember and suffer some physical pain.However, he did not expect that the remote control in his hand would start flashing crazily right after he had dozed off for a while.More than ten mechanical puppets had malfunctioned and had broken down.Just thinking about the cost of a mechanical puppet \u2026Fuck! I can\u2019t afford it even if I sell myself!Thinking of this, the youth\u2019s footsteps quickened. Finally, he reached the end of the passageway.From afar, he saw a lean and handsome youth boy amidst a pile of scrap metal, slowly pulling his arm out of a mechanical puppet\u2019s chest.When the youth noticed his arrival, he did not look surprised at all. Instead, he looked excited. His crystal-clear eyes gradually glowed, and there was a burning desire to fight in them.\u201cYou\u2019re finally here \u2026\u201dThe youth\u2019s expression was a little confused.His gaze fell on the mechanical puppets that were in a terrible state, and his mind went blank for a moment, losing the ability to think.His heart began bleeding. Suddenly, a gust of wind sounded in his ears. The youth\u2019s hair stood on end, and he instinctively retreated.Then, a young figure leaped high in front of him.His figure blocked the light from the top floor of the passageway, casting a shadow on his face. All the youth could see was a pair of burning eyes filled with anticipation.\u201cCome, guardian of the second test, I hope you won\u2019t disappoint me.\u201dThe youth was confused.When did I become the guardian of the second stage? Also \u2026 Where the fuck did this second test come from?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 \u2014 Dong QingxueIn a huge control room.Dong Qingxue sat in front of a table with her head lowered as she flipped through some documents.Her well-tailored dark blue uniform accentuated her perfect figure. Her slender legs were slightly crossed under the table. Even though they were wrapped in long pants, they were still as beautiful as a painting.Across from Dong Qingxue, in front of a large display screen and numerous buttons, a slender and handsome young man held a cup of coffee in his hand. As he admired the scene in front of him, he sighed from the bottom of his heart. \u201cWhat a pleasant and blissful day \u2026\u201dDong Qingxue raised her head and looked at the young man, whose epaulet had only one less star than hers. Her slender brows furrowed into beautiful lines on her pretty face.\u201cIf you\u2019re really free, please come over and help me review the documents \u2026 Major Qin Shaojun.\u201dThe young man took a sip of his coffee and laughed. He avoided her gaze as he said, \u201cI\u2019m busy, Lieutenant Colonel Qingxue. Besides, you\u2019re the main person in charge of the Prodigy Training Camp this time. I\u2019m just a temporary assistant.\u201dDong Qingxue stared at the young man for a while. In the end, she had no choice but to give up. The young man was known for his laziness. Besides, she was the one who had forced him to come and help this time.Dong Qingxue shook her head and continued flipping through the thick documents in her hand.The young man took a few sips of coffee. Perhaps he was bored, so he glanced over slowly. His eyes scanned the documents scattered on the table casually as he asked, \u201cHow is it? How\u2019s the quality of this year\u2019s Prodigy Training Camp?\u201d\u201cNot good.\u201d Dong Qingxue shook her head and said calmly, \u201cThere are only eight people in total who can be considered seedlings that meet our standards. All of them are official martial artists who have awakened their talents. Five of them are average. They only awakened the most common strength-type talents. The other three \u2026\u201dDong Qingxue picked out three documents from the pile and tossed them to the young man.\u201cOne of them is a speed-type talent and the other is a defense-type talent. Both of them have reached the standard of a Level 2 Martial Artists. This one is the most outstanding \u2026\u201dDong Qingxue picked out another document from the pile. She pointed at a girl with a determined gaze in the picture and said, \u201cXia Lin, 17 years and 8 months old. She has awakened her spiritual power less than two years ago. She\u2019s close to becoming a Level 1 Spiritual Master. She also has excellent talent in martial arts. She\u2019s about to enter Level 2.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that good?\u201d The young man exclaimed with an exaggerated expression, \u201cAn absolute genius, just like you back then. Her gaze is also very similar to yours. Qingxue, I think this little girl is fated to follow you \u2026\u201d\u201cStop fooling around.\u201dDong Qingxue shook her head, but there was still a hint of emotion in her eyes. She said, \u201cThis girl is indeed very good. I\u2019ve already listed her to be the focus of this training camp.\u201d\u201cThe others aren\u2019t bad either \u2026\u201d The young man tried to find a document that was pleasing to his eyes from the pile of documents on the table.After swiping away two of the three documents that Dong Qingxue had picked out, his gaze landed on the first document at the bottom.\u201cThis!\u201dThe young man picked up a document and waved it in front of Dong Qingxue. He smiled and said, \u201cHe\u2019s handsome enough, just like me. And he\u2019s outstanding in every aspect, too. His BQV has reached the standard of a Level 2 Martial Artist. His combat power \u2026 Fuck!\u201cPerfection Realm Fist Technique, combat power comparable to a Level 3 Martial Artist \u2026 How could you throw away such a good seedling? Qingxue, when did your standards become so high?\u201dDong Qingxue shook her head and said, \u201cI know which one you\u2019re talking about. This Lu Sheng was also one of the first-tier seeds that I\u2019ve chosen. He\u2019s even comparable to Xia Lin. However, I took him out later. You should know why, Shaojun.\u201dDong Qingxue looked into the Shaojun\u2019s eyes. The exaggerated shock on the young man\u2019s face faded bit by bit. Finally, he calmed down.\u201cI know. It\u2019s because of his talent.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s because of his talent.\u201dDong Qingxue nodded and said, \u201cThe upper limit of a strength-type talent is too low. It\u2019s indeed terrifying in the early stages. Under the augmentation of divine power, a Level 1 or Level 2 awakened strength-type talents can unleash combat power in the tens of thousands or even several tens of thousands.\u201cHowever! Once they reach the later stages, the little boost in strength brought by their talent will be useless against a Level 6 or Level 7 Martial Artist\u2019s huge BQV. In the end, they\u2019ll just fade into the crowd \u2026\u201dThe young man remained silent.Just as Dong Qingxue had said, strength-type talents would only bring a small advantage to martial artists in the later stages of martial arts until it was negligible. A Level 6 Martial Artist\u2019s BQV exceeded 1,000, and a Level 7 Master\u2019s BQV exceeded 10,000 \u2026One could just imagine. Under the surging BQV of a Master who had a million point in CPI, how much of a boost in strength could add to their abilities?A Master could easily comprehend skills and technique that would be more useful than these types of talents.On the other hand, the few people that Dong Qingxue had picked out. There was nothing much to be said about Xai Lin, as a Spiritual Master, she was a treasure wherever she went.As for the other two, one was a speed-type talent and the other was a defense-type talent.These two talents were very useful in the later stages of martial arts.The speed-type talent could easily break the speed of sound in the later stages. The defense-type talent was equivalent to one cultivating to full-mastery in parallel martial arts. It was so powerful that some Master Martial Artists of the same level.Therefore, although strength-type talent displayed by these two students were not as good as that student named Lu Sheng.However, Qin Shaojun was almost certain that in ten or twenty years, the achievements these two would have in martial arts would far surpass Lu Sheng.This was an ironclad rule that had been summed up by countless experiences and examples over the past 300 years of martial arts.There were no exceptions.[TN: Just to remind everyone. Talents are something Gifted Martial Artists awaken.].Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 \u2014 When Did You Let in a Level 4 Martial Artist?\u201cDo you remember the batch we were in? That person \u2026 Xiang Peng.\u201d Dong Qingxue asked.Qin Shaojun nodded. \u201cI know. There were many talented people in that batch \u2026\u201dThe batch Dong Qingxue was referring to had more than 20 Gifted Martial Artists in the Prodigy Training Camp.The Xiang Peng she was talking about was the \u201cking\u201d of that batch. When he entered the camp, his BQV was close to a Level 3 Martial Artist\u2019s, and his strength was extraordinary.He was almost everyone\u2019s \u201cnightmare\u201d.Qin Shaojun recalled parts of his body that were beaten up by him, which he still felt were hurting. One could only imagine how terrifying that guy was back then.\u201cHe\u2019s now \u2026\u201d Dong Qingxue paused, and said in a more tactful way, \u201cHe\u2019s not as dazzling as before.\u201dQin Shaojun nodded silently.In truth, Dong Qingxue did not know that he had secretly gone to look for that person once. When he went, he gritted his teeth and wanted to take revenge for what happened back then.However, when he saw him, he was dispirited and could not arouse any interest. They were no longer on the same level. There was no need to even mention revenge.\u201cThis Lu Sheng is talented, but it\u2019s a pity \u2026\u201d Dong Qingxue picked up Lu Sheng\u2019s information and scanned it from top to bottom. She sighed with emotion.This time, it was Qin Shaojun\u2019s turn to comfort Dong Qingxue.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to pity. The ones who are truly pitiful are these people \u2026\u201dQin Shaojun patted the thick stack of information on the remaining students. He was speechless. \u201cThey only have one or two points of BQV and were coaxed in by you guys as geniuses. In reality, they\u2019re just here to make up the numbers.\u201cNot only do they not get any benefits, but they might also be beaten up by these monsters. From then on, they\u2019ll be left with deep and indelible physical and psychological trauma \u2026\u201dDong Qingxue rolled her eyes at him and said, \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about? You\u2019re exaggerating. Even if they\u2019re just there to make up numbers, the training camp will still be of great help to them. Other places don\u2019t have such good cultivation conditions \u2026\u201dQin Shaojun shrugged. He did not comment.Just as the two of them were chatting, the giant composite machine opposite them suddenly changed.Qin Shaojun quickly walked over.\u201cIt\u2019s finally time for the show \u2026\u201d He whistled merrily.On the console in front of him, a few indicators that were originally green suddenly turned red and made a slight noise.\u201cPassageway No. 3, two mechanical puppets have sustained more than 10% damage \u2026 Passageway No. 8 also has \u2026\u201dQin Shaojun held his coffee in one hand and quickly operated on the table with the other. Soon, two separate surveillance images were displayed on the huge display screen.Dong Qingxue also came over to watch. In one of the images, there was a young man with a strong and sturdy figure.The young man had a peculiar, pale gray-white hue on his face and body. As the Level 2 Mechanical Puppet attacked him, it produced a deep thud akin to a hammer striking the ground, leaving behind only a faint white imprint.Taking advantage of its brief immobility, the young man rampaged through the passageway like a raging bull. One after another, the mechanical puppets were knocked to the ground by him. There were even some that were hit head-on, their shoulders and chests caved in from the impact.\u201cIs this the guy who awakened a defensive-type talent?Stone Skin Constitution? I remember there was one in our batch as well \u2026\u201d Qin Shaojun said with slight surprise.Dong Qingxue nodded and said, \u201cQi Meng, he\u2019s currently serving in the Southern Military Region with the rank of Captain. Oh, yes, he now has upgraded it to Steel Physique.\u201dQin Shaojun clicked his tongue.On the other surveillance image was a skinny young man.This young man was so fast that even the surveillance images could barely capture his figure.All they could see was the mechanical puppets that were being attacked continuously on the screen, appearing extremely clumsy.\u201cSpeed type, he\u2019s always been shameless \u2026\u201d Qin Shaojun sighed.At this moment, a series of urgent notifications suddenly rang from the table, and a few indicators turned from green to red.\u201cLoss rate of 15%, loss rate of 23%, loss rate of 30% \u2026\u201d Qin Shaojun looked at the series of numbers, and he seemed to grow excited. His eyes became brighter and brighter, and one of his hands moved quickly on the console.Soon, the third surveillance image appeared on the big screen.The content shown in this image was far beyond the imagination of ordinary people. A skinny girl walked in the dark, sealed passageway with an expressionless face.She did not have to do much.Wherever she passed, the mechanical puppets in front of her would be repelled by an invisible force and embedded deep into the steel wall beside them, automatically making way for the girl.\u201cThat\u2019s \u2026 insane!\u201dQin Shaojun looked at this scene that resembled the plot of a sci-fi movie and squeezed out a few\u00a0choice\u00a0words from his mouth. He looked at Dong Qingxue with eyes full of undisguised envy.\u201cYou spiritual masters are like bugs in the system! Do you not want us ordinary people to live \u2026?\u201dDong Qingxue stared at the girl in the image without blinking. A faint smile appeared on her lips as she said, \u201cSpiritual masters are powerful, but the difficulty of cultivation is too high. After Level 3, their progress will be slow. Moreover, spiritual masters with weak talent can\u2019t compare to martial artists, so they might as well focus on martial arts.\u201cHowever, it\u2019s true that spiritual masters have an easier time breaking through to the Master level \u2026\u201dQin Shaojun listened to Dong Qingxue\u2019s words with envy. He was about to take a sip from his coffee, when a series of ear-piercing alarms rang out of nowhere. It was very unsettling in the empty command room.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dBoth of them were startled. Qin Shaojun quickly operated on the table.\u201cPassageway 12 \u2026\u201dWhen the information for passageway 12 was pulled out, Qin Shaojun suddenly screamed as if he had seen a ghost. He could not even hold the coffee in his hand properly, and it spilled all over the floor.\u201cDegree of damage 80%, degree of damage 87%, degree of damage \u2026 Fuck! There were a total of 20 mechanical puppets, and more than 15 of them are over 80% damaged. They\u2019re almost scrapped!\u201cDong Qingxue, when did you let in a Level 4 Martial Artist?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 \u2014 That Person Was So Scary!\u201cHurry up and pull up the surveillance footage!\u201d Dong Qingxue urged him while her eyes were glued to the big screen.Qin Shaojun did not care about spilling coffee all over his hands and floor. He wiped them on his clothes and hurriedly pulled up the surveillance footage.When the surveillance footage of Passageway No.12 was displayed before them, even people like them who had been through a lot could not help but narrow their eyes slightly. Their expressions were dazed for a moment.In the footage of Passageway No.12, they could only see a group of pale-faced youths hiding in a corner, trembling. One of them was even unconscious on the ground.All of them were looking in the same direction with terrified expressions on their faces. They looked like ordinary people who had seen a monster in movies.Following their gazes, Dong Qingxue and Qin Shaojun saw a mess strewn about all over the ground.The ground was littered with broken mechanical puppets. Broken limbs and parts of the mechanical puppets were scattered all over the place, as well as other parts that had fallen from their bodies.As the camera zoomed in, Dong Qingxue and Qin Shaojun saw the ghastly wounds on the mechanical puppets and the walls beside them.The walls of the passageway, which were made of pure steel, were riddled with deep cavities \u2026 The entire passage looked like it had been ravaged by some terrifying monster.\u201cDamn it!\u201d Dong Qingxue\u2019s expression turned ugly.The cost of building a Level 2 Mechanical Puppet was not cheap. So many of them were damaged at once. Moreover, it was not just ordinary damage. They were basically scrapped.This was undoubtedly a huge loss of funds. After all, the base had just purchased this batch of Level 2 Mechanical Puppets.\u201cFuck!\u201d Qin Shaojun could not help but curse, \u201cEven a Level 3 Martial Artist couldn\u2019t beat up a Level 2 Mechanical Puppet like this. Their combat strength must be on par with at least Level 4 Martial Artists. Is there such a monster in this batch of students?\u201dQin Shaojun turned to look at Dong Qingxue.Dong Qingxue lowered her head and flipped through the information.\u201cPassageway No.12 was arranged for the Qingyuan City students. There aren\u2019t any outstanding people in Qingyuan City this year \u2026\u201d\u201cCould it be that someone snuck in?\u201d Dong Qingxue frowned. She wanted to grab the phone on the table and investigate, but she quickly put it down.\u201cForget it. We\u2019ll know when we get there.\u201d Dong Qingxue was a little frustrated. \u201cAre the supervisors of Passageway No.12 all dead? So many mechanical puppets have been destroyed, and they don\u2019t even know how to stop them \u2026\u201dShe suddenly stopped halfway through her sentence.Dong Qingxue and Qin Shaojun looked at each other and thought of the same possibility at the same time.Perhaps it wasn\u2019t that the personnel in charge of supervising Passageway 12 didn\u2019t come out to stop, but that they didn\u2019t have the ability to stop the person at all.Thinking back to the horrifying scenes, she had seen earlier, Dong Qingxue\u2019s heart skipped a beat.\u201cHurry up! Let\u2019s go to Passageway 12!\u201d The two of them hurriedly rushed out of the control room.\u2026Boom!A mechanical puppet was sent flying by an invisible force and fell to the ground.The mechanical puppet\u2019s eyes flashed with a red light as it stood up shakily. There was a depression of a few centimeters on its chest.Xia Lin looked at the mechanical puppet with vigilance. Only when she was sure that it was the same as the previous mechanical puppet and would no longer attack after being knocked down once did she let out a sigh of relief.This was the last mechanical puppet.This also meant that she had passed this time\u2019s entrance examination.Xia Lin quickly walked towards the exit. When she was near the exit, she stopped and looked behind her with a pensive expression.Her spiritual strength told her that someone was hiding there.A person who gave her a strong sense of danger was at least Level 3 or above.He didn\u2019t come out to stop me, which means that he\u2019s not part of the examination. He should be one of the supervisors in charge of the examination \u2026\u00a0Xia Lin guessed.Xia Lin reached out and opened the door to the exit. Light shone in from outside. Only then did she completely relax.Xia Lin walked out of the small door.She suddenly realized that there were many soldiers in blue military uniforms gathered outside the door.However, these people were obviously not here for her. Each of them had a nervous expression on their faces, as if they were about to face a great enemy. They were staring in a direction to the side.Xia Lin looked in that direction curiously. She saw another small door.Just as Xia Lin was puzzled.Creak~The small door was pushed open from the inside.The moment the small door was opened, Xia Lin, who had sharp senses, immediately noticed everybody\u2019s bodies tense up. They seemed to be afraid and nervous about something.Out of curiosity, Xia Lin released her spiritual power and carefully probed inside the door. Suddenly, Xia Lin\u2019s body stiffened. She \u201csaw\u201d a person through her spiritual perception.The person was dragging another while he was coming out.And the person had obviously noticed Xia Lin\u2019s presence.From the darkness, that person slowly peeked out half of his body, revealing a fair and handsome young face. It was a young man about the same age as her.Xia Lin looked at the young man\u2019s eyes in a daze.From those crystal-clear eyes, she could feel traces of scorching heat and even deeper coldness that had yet to fade away.Swoosh!In an instant, Xia Lin\u2019s mental perception was like a startled tentacle that suddenly retracted and wrapped around her tightly.This was an almost instinctual reaction, just like how one would immediately retract their hand after being burned by fire, or how animals would instinctively run away when they sensed danger \u2026Bam!Shaylin quickly retreated into the small door that she had just walked out of and slammed the exit door shut. She leaned against the door tightly as her full chest heaved up and down violently. Her heart was beating wildly.At this moment, there was only one thought left in Shaylin\u2019s mind.That person was so scary! \u2026\u2026\u2014 Author\u2019s Notes \u2014Actually, I don\u2019t really want to explain the problem with this setting because I\u2019ve already tried my best to write it clearly in the book.However, since it\u2019s a free period, I\u2019ll say more.The difference between strength, speed, and defense is actually very easy to understand.The fastest person in the world is about 1.5 times faster than a normal adult male, while the strongest person in the world is more than five times stronger than a normal adult male.What does this mean?This means that the difficulty of training strength is much lower than training speed and defense.Moreover, in this book, the bonus of health points to a martial artist is more on strength.The Combat Power Index in the book also measures the explosive power of a punch.It\u2019s not that the strength-type talent can\u2019t grow, but after the strength talent grows, it will be overshadowed by the increase in BQV [aka health points]. Therefore, in the later stages, the bonus to a martial artist\u2019s overall strength is not as obvious as defense and speed.Even in many games, if you only focus on strength, in the later stages, you will definitely be trash.Instead, if you focus on agility, health, and defense, you will be able to do well in the later stages.At least that\u2019s what I think, haha.That\u2019s about it, if you really can\u2019t accept it, then there\u2019s nothing you can do \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 \u2014 He Was Very Powerful, I Couldn\u2019t Hold Back!\u201cDo you know what\u2019s going on inside?\u201dWhen Dong Qingxue and Qin Shaojun arrived at the entrance of Passageway 12, it was already surrounded by the soldiers of the training camp.A square-faced middle-aged man in military uniform walked quickly to Dong Qingxue and reported in a low voice, \u201cThe surveillance cameras near the entrance have been destroyed. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on inside yet.\u201d\u201cWhat about the supervisors inside?\u201d\u201cWe lost contact three minutes ago. We were about to report this to our superiors.\u201dDong Qingxue\u2019s face was expressionless. She said calmly, \u201cGive me a copy of the information of all the students who entered Passageway 12. Immediately!\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dSoon, the square-faced middle-aged man brought a stack of information to Dong Qingxue. However, strangely, Dong Qingxue shook her head.\u201cForget it, there\u2019s no need.\u201dThe square-faced man was stunned. He did not understand the reason.At this moment, a muffled sound came from the small door at the entrance of Passageway 12 not far away.Bang!This loud sound seemed to have struck the hearts of everyone present. The square-faced man and his subordinates instantly became nervous.The soldiers immediately readied themselves for battle.They were just waiting for their commander\u2019s order to immediately pounce on the person who walked out of the door and subdue him \u2026 Or, they would be subdued.Compared to the nervousness and seriousness of her subordinates, Dong Qingxue\u2019s expression was a little strange.Her eyes narrowed slightly as she stared at the small door. Her eyes shone with strange light, as if she was trying to see through the small door to see what was going on inside.Just as everyone was waiting for the battle to begin.Creak~The door opened. It was the passage on the side. A girl with an indifferent expression walked out of the door. Seeing such a large formation outside the door, although it was not targeted at her, the girl was obviously stunned.The soldiers glanced at the girl and immediately looked away. They continued to focus on the small door in front of them.Finally \u2026The small door that belonged to Passageway 12 was slowly pushed open from the inside.The sunlight cast on a silhouette. A figure slowly peeked from the darkness \u2026Everyone\u2019s nerves began to tense.However, when they saw the figure\u2019s face clearly \u2026 they relaxed, instantly.The person who walked out of the door was a young man. He was just a kid who wasn\u2019t very old. He was handsome and had clear eyes. He had a clean look to him.To think that they were so nervous just now. Some of them even revealed self-depreciating smiles when they thought of how they were facing a great enemy just now.But in the next moment, the smiles on their faces froze. It was as if they had seen something extremely terrifying. Their eyes widened, and their pupils gradually revealed an extremely shocked and fearful expression.The young man walked out of the darkness.He raised a hand in front of his forehead as if to block the sun. The other hand seemed to be dragging something heavy.Sha-sha~A body covered in dust and blood was dragged out of the tunnel by the young man with one hand, casually throwing it on the ground that was bathed in sunlight.Bang!The body fell to the ground, revealing the face of an unconscious man. A soldier recognized this face and stammered, \u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 It\u2019s the missing Lieutenant Wang \u2026\u201dHe was an officer in the base, and many people knew him. He was a Level 3 Martial Artist with decent strength. This time, he was in charge of overseeing Passageway 12.But now, this young Martial Dao powerhouse was dragged and thrown on the ground like a dead dog.Everyone was stunned.They stared blankly at the handsome young man who stood under the sun, his appearance as clean and clear as crystal.For a moment, they seemed to be in a daze.Bang!A door slammed shut.The small door at the side of the tunnel was slammed shut, and the girl who was standing there just now was nowhere to be seen.Everyone was stunned, and their minds could not process what had just happened.Only Dong Qingxue\u2019s expression remained the same. However, Dong Qingxue had to admit it. Even though she had already used her spiritual power to scan the tunnel, yet she was still shocked when she saw it with her own eyes.Even Qin Shaojun, who was standing at the side, was stunned.As if noticing everyone\u2019s strange expressions, the young man was silent for a moment before he tried to explain.\u201cHe was very powerful. I couldn\u2019t hold back.\u201dSilence.The place fell into an eerie silence.There was the sound of someone gulping.A moment later, Dong Qingxue\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cStudent Lu Sheng from Baihe City, congratulations on passing the entrance examination.\u201d\u2026Lu Sheng was led by a soldier to the camp to rest. Lu Sheng\u2019s expression was calm, but some emotions were slowly surging in his heart.He finally realized that he seemed to have misunderstood the content of the test this time.The Level 3 Martial Artist who had suddenly rushed out did not seem to be part of this test.In other words \u2026 He had hit the wrong person.Lu Sheng felt helpless.Who asked the other party to hide in the tunnel sneakily and rush out in a hurry? It was normal for him to misunderstand.Fortunately, even though he had hit the wrong person, he still managed to beat up the examiner by accident.At least he had successfully passed this exam.Originally, Lu Sheng came to this Prodigy Training Camp with a relatively casual attitude, but now, Lu Sheng was starting to become interested.He had sensed it earlier.He had sensed two spiritual masters, who had similar perception techniques, in this training camp.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 \u2013 Shadow of the DevilOne of them was a girl about his age. She should be a trainee in this training camp. The other one was the highest-ranking commanding officer in this training camp.Dong Qingxue was a lieutenant colonel in the Eastern Military Region.That was the information Lu Sheng had just received. When Lu Sheng walked out of Passageway 12, both of them released their spiritual power to probe him.The girl\u2019s spiritual power was very weak. It was probably not even one-tenth of Lu Sheng\u2019s. Dong Qingxue\u2019s spiritual power was much stronger. It was at least five times stronger than Lu Sheng\u2019s.Lu Sheng was very careful.When he sensed that a spiritual power was probing him, he immediately retracted his perception, so he shouldn\u2019t have been discovered.It was not a good or bad thing to be discovered. It was just an instinctive reaction.There are even spiritual masters. It seems that this training camp is not completely filled with ordinary people \u2026\u00a0Lu Sheng thought to himself.Yes, for example, Lin Shaoyu and the others in Qingyuan City had been classified as \u201cordinary people\u201d by Lu Sheng.He wondered how these self-proclaimed geniuses would feel if they found out that they had been categorized as ordinary.The soldier in military uniform led Lu Sheng to a dormitory. He gave him a few simple instructions and left.The soldier looked at Lu Sheng strangely the entire time.More than ten minutes ago, it was this seemingly harmless high school student who had beaten his superior up and dragged him out of the passage like a dead dog.Lu Sheng walked into the dormitory.The training camp\u2019s living conditions were better than he had expected. All the furniture and appliances were available. There was also a separate bathroom and toilet.There was even a small BQV testing device in the corner of the room. It allowed the trainees to know their vitality (vitality or Qi) at any time.Most importantly, this was a single-person dormitory.In other words, Lu Sheng did not have to worry about being discovered and influenced by others when he practiced the Stellar Body Refining Technique in the dormitory.I haven\u2019t tested my BQV in a long time. Let\u2019s test it first.Ever since the Official Martial Artist Assessment, Lu Sheng had not tested his BQV. It had been almost two weeks, and he was also very curious about his current numbers.He took his blood and tested it.With a pleasant beep, a number appeared before Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes.53.692Compared to the last time, it had increased by 38 points.\u201cAfter a few breakthroughs in my BQV, coupled with the continuous consumption of Spiritual Muscle and Blood Strengthening Decoction and Marrow Nourishing Pills, it\u2019s normal for me to have such an increase in my BQV \u2026\u201cAt this rate, I estimate that in another month, I will be able to break through Level 3 and officially enter the stage of refining my muscles and bones.\u201dLu Sheng was filled with satisfaction.This process of his BQV increasing step by step and his ability becoming stronger made him feel very fulfilled and satisfied.\u2026In the control room of the training camp.On the ground in the center of the room, there were many broken mechanical puppets.These mechanical puppets were all badly damaged, either missing an arm, a leg, or a head. Many parts of their bodies showed signs of being squeezed, crushed, and twisted.They were like rag dolls that had been ravaged by giants.It gave people a fierce shock.Dong Qingxue and Qin Shaojun were standing in the room, but their attention was not on the puppets. Instead, they were staring at the big screen in front of them.On the big screen, the closed-circuit surveillance footage of Passageway 12 was being played.It started with Lu Sheng and the youths from Qingyuan City entering the passage and ending with them walking out of the passage.When the entire video was played, Dong Qingxue and Qin Shaojun\u2019s faces were filled with shock.Extreme shock.\u201cThe Level 2 Mechanical Puppets are like toys in his hands. That first lieutenant with the ability of a Level 3 Martial Artist didn\u2019t last more than a minute against him \u2026\u201dQin Shaojun looked at Dong Qingxue in shock and said, \u201cThis kid is a monster, a monster in actual combat! His combat power is off the charts. It\u2019s not just 15,000, it\u2019s probably 100,000. He\u2019s comparable to a Level 4 Martial Artist \u2026Didn\u2019t the data say that this kid\u2019s BQV is only 15?\u201d\u201cHow would I know? Does he look like he has a BQV of 15 now \u2026\u201dDong Qingxue\u2019s expression was just as complicated.\u201cEither, he deliberately hid part of his ability during the martial artist assessment two weeks ago. Or \u2026\u201d Dong Qingxue paused and thought about it.In two weeks, his BQV had increased from 15 to almost comparable to a Level 4 Martial Artist. Such a terrifying growth rate could only mean that \u2026\u201c\u2026 He might very well become the second Xiang Peng!\u201d[TN: Xiang Peng is the batch mate mentioned in c55.]Qin Shaojun was stunned. He could not help but recall the fear of being dominated by a certain man when he first joined the training camp.That kind of absolute superiority in strength brought a suffocating pressure to the bystanders. Qin Shaojun remembered that he had nightmares for a few weeks after returning from the training camp.It was terrifying.Back then, Xiang Peng was simply the overlord of their training camp. Everyone had to look up to him, and he was the great Devil that everyone wanted to challenge!Now, Qin Shaojun could vaguely see the shadow of the Devil in the student named Lu Sheng on the screen. Oh no, Lu Sheng was even crazier than the Devil back then!Even Xiang Peng back then could not squash a Level 2 Mechanical Puppet as if it were a mere chicken.\u201cSo, what are you going to do with this Lu Sheng now \u2026\u201d Qin Shaojun could not help but ask.Dong Qingxue\u2019s eyes flashed as she replied, \u201cI haven\u2019t thought about it yet, but I\u2019m sure my previous judgment of Lu Sheng was wrong. For the time being, let\u2019s train him as the top seed, like Xia Lin. After all \u2026\u201dDong Qingxue looked at the tall and lean figure on the screen. She took a deep breath and said slowly, \u201cTalent ability aside. What he\u2019s shown so far is already shocking enough!\u201dQin Shaojun understood what Dong Qingxue meant.Based on Lu Sheng\u2019s previous information. He was 17 years old, a Level 2 Martial Artist, a strength-type martial artist.Perhaps in the eyes of ordinary people, this was already a terrifying number. However, for Qin Shaojun and Dong Qingxue who had seen too many geniuses, it was not considered outstanding.There was even a high chance that he would fade into the crowd in the future. Xiang Peng was the best example.However!If this resume was added with prefixes such as \u201cPerfect Level Fist Technique\u201d, \u201cCombat power comparable to a Level 4 Martial Artist\u201d, and \u201cEasily crushing an official Level 3 Martial Artist in actual combat\u201d.Then, it would be different.Combat power and combat ability were two completely different concepts.Being able to get a Combat Power Index in the tens of thousands during the test did not mean that one could unleash this combat power in battle.Yet, Lu Sheng had done it. He was far beyond that.That alone was terrifying.In Qin Shaojun\u2019s words, he was \u2026 a combat monster. A combat genius. A natural \u2026 martial artist!Even if the current Lu Sheng was not a talented martial artist and did not have any talent ability. This alone was enough to greatly increase his rating in Dong Qingxue\u2019s mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 \u2014 Purple Hairband\u201cIt\u2019s time to eat \u2026\u201dLu Sheng opened his eyes. He had just gnawed on a few tough bones in his dream when he was woken up by the soldiers of the training camp, informing him that he could go to the mess to eat.Lu Sheng looked at the time. It was already evening, and he was indeed hungry.Following the map of the training camp on the table, Lu Sheng found the mess. The mess was huge and divided into three floors. The trainees ate on the first floor.Walking into the mess, Lu Sheng saw boys and girls of his age. They were obviously trainees participating in the training camp.Lu Sheng even saw the group of people from Qingyuan City, including Lin Shaoyu. His head was wrapped in bandages, and he was lining up with the help of two people with a pale face.Many trainees in the mess had obvious bandages on their bodies, and they looked a little pathetic.It seems that although there is an entrance examination, regardless of whether one passes the test or not, they are still qualified to stay \u2026\u00a0Lu Sheng thought to himself.Lu Sheng found a random window to get food and lined up silently.The trainees in front of him were from an unknown city in the Dongning Province, and they were still discussing the test in the morning.\u201cThose mechanical puppets are too ferocious. I was just carelessly grazed by one of them, and my back still hurts even now \u2026\u201d\u201cYou think? After all, they are Level 2 Mechanical Puppets. Even a Level 3 Martial Artist might not be able to defeat them head-on. We are lucky that we were not killed or crippled.\u201d\u201cHow could we be killed or crippled? There are examiners here. But I have to say, this test is too crazy \u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that. I heard that someone beat up an examiner this year. Heard he\u2019s still unconscious in the infirmary \u2026\u201d\u201cAre you for real?! The examiners have to be at least Level 3 Martial Artists, or they can\u2019t protect us from the Level 2 Mechanical Puppets. Someone can beat the examiners?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t listen to his nonsense! I also heard that the mechanical puppets in one of the test passageways were all destroyed. Someone saw the base soldiers loading the broken Level 2 Mechanical Puppets into trucks \u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too exaggerated. It must be fake!\u201d\u2026Lu Sheng stayed in the group and remained silent. He now realized how much he had messed up during the day.Finally, it was Lu Sheng\u2019s turn.The food in the training camp was surprisingly good. There were more than 30 types of meat dishes, most of which were meat that Lu Sheng had never seen before. Moreover, he could eat them indefinitely, which was most suitable for a glutton like him.Lu Sheng casually ordered five servings of food and looked for a place to settle down with the plate in his hand.Perhaps it was because the scale of the dishes in his hands was too exaggerated, it attracted the attention of many people. Many people cast sidelong glances at him.The group of people from Qingyuan City also noticed his presence. In the end, each one of them acted as if they had seen a ghost. They turned around and ran. Some of them didn\u2019t even bother to get their meals and directly ran towards the entrance of the mess.It could be seen that Lu Sheng had left too much psychological trauma on them during the day in the passage.Just as Lu Sheng was about to find a place to sit down, someone quickly walked towards him.\u201cLu Sheng, right?\u201d She was a tall and beautiful girl.\u201cI\u2019m also a student from Baihe City who is participating in the training camp. If you don\u2019t mind \u2026 let\u2019s sit down and eat together?\u201d The girl reached out and brushed the hair on her temples, looking a little embarrassed.Lu Sheng was hesitating whether to accept this sudden invitation. The girl quickly continued, \u201cActually, we\u2019ve met before. It was at the Baihe Martial Arts Association when we participated in the Official Martial Artist Assessment \u2026 Do you remember?\u201dLu Sheng was stunned for a moment before he recalled the girl\u2019s identity.\u201cYou\u2019re that \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng thought for a moment and said with certainty, \u201cPurple hairband.\u201dThe girl smiled and nodded. \u201cMy name is Yang Yuan.\u201dWhen he participated in the assessment at the Baihe Martial Arts Association, this girl was the same as Lu Sheng. She was the youngest among all the candidates. The two of them had even shared a quick glances at each other a few times, so he had an impression of her.However, she didn\u2019t wear the purple hairband today. Instead, she wore a pink one.\u201cSpeaking of which, we\u2019re actually quite fated. I know your sister, Lu Qinghe. Qinghe often talks about you to me \u2026\u201d Yang Yuan blushed a little when she said that.She had always been regarded as a cold goddess in school. She didn\u2019t expect that there would be a time when she used her connections to get close to a boy.\u201cHehe, is that so \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng smiled and didn\u2019t expose Yang Yuan\u2019s lie.How could his sister, Lu Qinghe, often talk about him in front of others? She was embarrassed of him.However, Lu Sheng remembered that Lu Qinghe did mention Yang Yuan\u2019s existence. Previously, when he met Lu Qinghe and her two best friends at the Martial Arts Association, the three girls seemed to have gone to accompany Yang Yuan.Since they were all acquaintances, Lu Sheng readily agreed. \u201cSure, where do you want to sit?\u201dYang Yuan\u2019s eyes lit up. She eagerly led Lu Sheng the way.\u201cOver here, the few of us from Baihe City are sitting together.\u201dYang Yuan led Lu Sheng to a long table and sat down. There were seven or eight boys and girls sitting at the long table. These people were all looking at Lu Sheng with curious gazes.During the period before they came to the training camp, the biggest news in Baihe City was this young man who was about the same age as them standing in front of them.It was no exaggeration to say that Lu Sheng was the \u201ccelebrity\u201d among the high school students in Baihe City.Lu Sheng smiled at this group of people, then buried his head and started eating. He wasn\u2019t good at socializing, and he disdained to do so.After silently watching Lu Sheng eat for a while, Yang Yuan, who had been deliberating for a long time, finally broke the awkwardness.\u201cLu Sheng \u2026 Do you know anything about this Prodigy \u00a0Training Camp?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 \u2014 Lu Sheng Would Fade into the Crowd\u201cNope.\u201dLu Sheng picked up a piece of pink meat and stuffed it into his mouth without looking up. He did not know what kind of meat it was, but the texture was much firmer than he had imagined, and it tasted quite good.Yang Yuan\u2019s mind was not on the food at all.\u201cI know a little about it. Do you want to know?\u201dSilence.\u201c\u2026\u201dYang Yuan stared at Lu Sheng for a while, hoping that Lu Sheng would react. However, Lu Sheng only buried his head in his food, which made her feel rather awkward.She did not know if she should continue.Fortunately, Lu Sheng quickly realized this. He nodded symbolically and said, \u201cGo on.\u201dAs he spoke, he picked up a piece of rib from an unknown animal and took a big bite. It was delicious.Yang Yuan breathed a sigh of relief and quickly said, \u201cThe Prodigy Training Camp this time is jointly organized by the Dongning Department of Education, the Martial Arts Association, and the Eastern Military Region.\u201cLieutenant Colonel Dong Qingxue of the Eastern Military Region is the person in charge of this training camp. It is said that Dong Qingxue is from the Dong family \u2026\u201dYang Yuan spoke for a while and realized that Lu Sheng was not interested in this at all. She quickly changed the topic and continued, \u201cI\u2019ve asked the seniors who participated in the training camp in the last few batches. I learned from them that the most difficult part of this training camp is not how to get in, but \u2026 How to stay.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s interest was finally piqued. He slowed down eating a little.Yang Yuan saw that Lu Sheng was finally interested in her topic. She straightened her back and continued, \u201cWhat I mean is, there are conditions for people like us to stay in this training camp.\u201d\u201cWhat conditions?\u201d Lu Sheng asked.Yang Yuan replied, \u201cIt\u2019s something like points. According to the seniors from the previous batch, we have to spend a certain amount of points every day in the training camp. For example, we have to pay for lodging, food, and ask the teachers in the training camp for questions \u2026\u201d\u201cThere are conditions for food?\u201d Lu Sheng frowned.\u201cYes.\u201d Yang Yuan replied bitterly, \u201cDo you think we\u2019re eating ordinary food now?\u201cMost of this meat are from exotic beasts. After special processing, it\u2019s cooked into food that helps us martial artists cultivate.\u201cLong-term consumption is good for martial artists to increase their vitality (BQV). It can also strengthen their physique in all aspects without developing resistance to supplements.\u201cHowever, they are ridiculously expensive. For example, the Rank 2 Black Toothed Sword Pork that you are eating right now, in the outside world, a single serving would cost at least 10,000 yuan.\u201cMoreover, that\u2019s only the price for the dishes that haven\u2019t been processed and cooked. If it was properly prepared and cooked, the price could reach more than 50,000 yuan. If it wasn\u2019t for the training camp, how could someone from an average family afford to eat it every day? Unless your father is the richest man in Baihe City.\u201cNot to mention that a lot of the meat can\u2019t even be bought outside, it\u2019s all specially supplied by the military \u2026\u201d\u201cI see \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng looked at the piece of meat in his hand and was rather surprised. He didn\u2019t expect such a piece of meat to be so expensive. In other words, he had eaten at least a hundred to two hundred thousand yuan worth of meat for his meal.Originally, he had thought that he was quite rich after receiving the one million yuan prize from the Baihe Martial Arts Association.Only now did he realize that he didn\u2019t even have enough to eat and wear.\u201c\u2026 Other than that, there are many special training rooms in the training camp that are very helpful for martial arts training. They are also very difficult to use outside, or rather, one has to pay a huge price to use them.\u201dYang Yuan said with a worried expression. It could be said that the longer you stay in this training camp, the more benefits you will gain.And the condition for staying was points.\u201cEarning points is very difficult! \u201d\u201cHow difficult is it?\u201d Lu Sheng felt a little full. The exotic beast meat was indeed full of energy. One gram was equivalent to a few pounds of ordinary beef and mutton. But when he thought of the frightening price of the meat, he still insisted on eating.\u201cVery, very difficult \u2026\u201d Yang Yuan smiled bitterly. \u201cLet\u2019s put it this way. So far, there are only three people in the training camp with points. The others are still at 0 for the time being. In other words, if we don\u2019t earn a certain amount of points soon, we will be kicked out tomorrow.\u201d\u201cWhich three? How did they get their points?\u201d Lu Sheng couldn\u2019t help but be curious.Yang Yuan explained, \u201cIt\u2019s the entrance examination today. Those who clear the exams will be rewarded with points. And I heard that only three people cleared the exam.\u201d\u201cOne is Cao Yong from Yanglin City, a Level 2 Martial Artist with Stone Skin Constitution that can greatly increase his defense. He cleared the examination.\u201cThe other is Meng Jinhe from Donggang City, also a Level 2 Martial Artist with a speed-type talent. He also cleared it.\u201cAnd the last one \u2026 Hey, it\u2019s her \u2026\u201d Yang Yuan suddenly looked in a direction.Lu Sheng followed Yang Yuan\u2019s gaze and saw a girl with a cold temperament walking in to the mess area with a bowl of rice.\u201cIt\u2019s her?\u201d Lu Sheng was a little surprised. He remembered this girl.When he came out of the passageway, it was this girl who used her spiritual power to detect him. Then, she was frightened by him and hid in the passage in fear.As if sensing Lu Sheng\u2019s gaze, the girl looked at him. The moment she saw Lu Sheng, the girl was stunned. Her face suddenly turned pale, and then she turned around and walked away without hesitation. Her footsteps were fast and unfaltering.\u201cYou know her? Indeed, it\u2019s normal for you to know her. Many people know her.\u201cAlthough Xia Lin, from Baoding City, is not a Level 2 Martial Artist, she is indeed a spiritual master who is rarer than Gifted Martial Artists. She should be the most talented and the strongest in this training camp. I heard that the training camp\u2019s higher-ups have been paying attention to her for a long time \u2026\u201d\u201cOnly 3 people cleared the exam. It was simply too difficult, even more difficult than the previous one. Didn\u2019t you see Xia Lin\u2019s face after she cleared the examination? She even left in such a hurry. I guess she was also tortured during the exam \u2026\u201dLu Sheng was speechless.Yang Yuan\u2019s expression was full of emotion.Before entering the training camp, she had thought that her martial arts talent was not bad and could be considered as genius.But after entering, she knew what a real genius was! A monster! A demon!She had been a little complacent when she passed the Level 1 Martial Artist Assessment some time ago. But after entering the training camp, she realized that there were Level 1 Martial Artists around her age everywhere.There were even Level 2 Martial Artists who had awakened their talents.Above the Gifted Martial Artists (those who have special talents), there were even more rare and powerful spiritual masters.Each one was stronger than the next. Even if it was Lu Sheng \u2026Yang Yuan could not help but think to herself as she looked at the genius in front of her who had once shocked the entire Baihe City.Even if it was Lu Sheng, he too would soon fade into the crowd.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 \u2014 The Rumored Fourth Person!\u201cNormal geniuses aren\u2019t much. Only geniuses who have awakened their talents are considered true geniuses. Even if they are Gifted Martial Artists, most of them did not pass the assessment. There are only three of them. It is said that there is another person who cleared it, but I\u2019m guessing that it is fake \u2026\u201d Yang Yuan jabbered on and on.Lu Sheng casually asked her, \u201cWhy do you say that the rumored fourth person is fake?\u201dYang Yuan laughed, \u201cBecause the fourth person is too exaggerated. Some people said that the fourth person who cleared the assessment was terrifyingly strong. Not only did he destroy a bunch of Level 2 Mechanical Puppets, he even beat up the examiner in the passageway. How is that possible?\u201cThe examiner is a genuine Level 3 Martial Artist. Moreover, he is someone who is outstanding in all aspects. If you want to beat the examiner, you need to be at least a Level 4 Martial Artist. And becoming a Level 4 Martial Artist at our age?\u201dYang Yuan shook her head and concluded, \u201cIt all sounds made up. Bunch of nonsense.\u201dLu Sheng did not say anything and just continued to eat silently.Suddenly, Yang Yuan thought of something and could not hold back her curiosity. She asked Lu Sheng, \u201cOh right, Lu Sheng, you are the strongest among us. You are a Level 2 Martial Artist and you are also a Gifted Martial Artist. Did you clear the assessment?\u201dWhen Yang Yuan asked this question, the students Baihe City sitting nearby all turned their heads to look at them. Although they did not join in the conversation, they were actually keenly listening to them.Now that it involved the question they were most curious about, they naturally could not help but turn their heads.\u201cUh \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng stopped what he was doing and did not know how to answer. He wanted to say that he was the person Yang Yuan was talking about, but they might not believe him.It did not seem good to not tell the truth.When they saw Lu Sheng\u2019s hesitant expression, Yang Yuan and others had a change in thought.They concluded that he probably did not clear it, and he was embarrassed to answer.Actually, it was normal.The more talented a person was, the more arrogant they would be. After realizing that they were not as good as others, they would feel even more disappointed.Yang Yuan was already like this, let alone Lu Sheng, who was much more talented than her, a martial arts genius known by everyone in Baihe City, and a celebrity.Thinking of this, Yang Yuan quickly comforted him, \u201cActually, it\u2019s normal that you didn\u2019t clear it. The assessment is so crazy. How could ordinary people clear \u2026\u201dJust as they were talking, a man who looked like an officer suddenly walked into the mess with a few soldiers. After looking around, he walked straight towards Lu Sheng.Everyone looked at them curiously, not knowing what they were here for.\u201c\u2026 I believe in your strength. If you stay in the training camp for a while, you might not be any weaker than Cao Yong and the others \u2026\u201d Yang Yuan was painstakingly comforting Lu Sheng, completely unaware that a few people had already walked up to her.A girl sitting next to Yang Yuan couldn\u2019t help but tug at her sleeve.Yang Yuan seemed to have woken up from a dream. She raised her head and saw several military uniforms facing her.Yang Yuan was a little confused.However, these people were obviously not here for her.The leading officer faced Lu Sheng, who had been silently accepting Yang Yuan\u2019s \u201ccomfort\u201d, and said with a serious expression, \u201cStudent Lu Sheng, right? Due to the fact that you destroyed 18 Level 2 Mechanical Puppets in our base during the camp entrance examination, and also injured a first lieutenant to the point of being unconscious and hospitalized him \u2026 we\u2019re going to have to ask you some routine questions. Please cooperate with us.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Please follow us.\u201d The commanding officer\u2019s deep voice echoed in the huge mess hall.The originally noisy mess instantly quieted down. It fell into a strange silence. The students who were eating all froze. Their expressions froze, and their bodies froze.Some of them even maintained the posture of eating with their mouths wide open.Now, all of them were frozen.Each one of them seemed to have been hit by a Body Immobilization Spell.As for Yang Yuan and the other Baihe City students who were sitting opposite Lu Sheng, their expressions were even more exaggerated.Yang Yuan\u2019s face was blank as she stood rooted to the ground. It was as if ten thousand planes had flown past her mind.Destroyed 18 Level 2 Mechanical Puppets \u2026\u00a0Injured a first lieutenant to the point of being unconscious and hospitalized \u2026\u00a0The rumors were true!The fourth person in the rumors that she had judged to be nonsense really existed!And it was Lu Sheng!Then why did she keep comforting Lu Sheng \u2026Yang Yuan was completely dumbfounded. She didn\u2019t know what words to use to describe her current feelings. She only felt like she was dreaming.Everything that had just happened felt surreal.\u201cOkay.\u201dLu Sheng stood up straightforwardly. He lowered his head and looked at the plate on the table. He said, \u201cBut I\u2019m not full yet. Can you let me pack another portion?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d The commanding officer nodded and agreed. \u201cWe\u2019ll get someone to pack another portion for you and send it to your dorm.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d Lu Sheng nodded in satisfaction.Then, he nodded and greeted the petrified Baihe City students before following the commanding officer out of the canteen.After Lu Sheng and the others left the canteen.The spell seemed to have been lifted.The quiet canteen was instantly filled with intense exclamations and discussions.\u201cFuck! Fuck! The rumors were actually true! Someone really destroyed more than 10 mechanical puppets, and even sent the examiner to the hospital!\u201d\u201cThe rumored fourth person, Baihe City\u2019s Lu Sheng \u2026 Hiss!\u201d\u201cWhat a monster! Simply perverse!\u201dAs for Yang Yuan and the other Baihe City students, they were so shocked that they couldn\u2019t utter a single word.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 \u2014 Don\u2019t Come Over!It was not as troublesome as Lu Sheng had imagined. Routine questions were just that. Questions. The people in the base asked Lu Sheng a few questions about what happened during the assessment and then let him go.They did not ask him to compensate for the broken puppets, nor did they ask him to take responsibility for the unconscious examiner.Lu Sheng returned to his dorm and there was a set of packed food on the table. It was almost all meat dishes, and they were all exotic beast meat.To avoid wasting food, Lu Sheng immediately used the Stellar Body Refinement Technique.With the double boost of the Stellar Body Refinement Technique and Natural Breathing Technique, Lu Sheng digested all the exotic beast meat in his stomach.The energy in the meat turned into a stream of heat and was quickly absorbed by Lu Sheng.\u201cIt almost has the same effect as taking a Marrow Nourishing Pill \u2026\u201d \u00a0Lu Sheng was quite satisfied with the energy provided by the exotic beast meat.He was originally worried that after staying in the training camp for so long, he would not have a place to replenish his Marrow Nourishing Pills.But now, he did not have to worry about that anymore. The large amount of exotic beast meat served to make up for this weakness perfectly.Lu Sheng was slightly satisfied when he felt his BQV increasing again. He also finished the packed food.Not long after he finished eating, another soldier came.\u201cGather at the base\u2019s great hall at 8 o\u2019clock.\u201dIt was almost 8 o\u2019clock. Lu Sheng packed up a little and followed the soldier to the great hall.Just a few seconds after he stepped through the door, the great hall, which was originally noisy, suddenly became silent. Hundreds of pairs of eyes looked at him at the same time.Shock, surprise, awe, curiosity, doubt \u2026 Gazes filled with all kinds of emotions surrounded him.What happened in the mess hall at night had already spread among the students.Lu Sheng of Baihe City, the legendary fourth person to pass the assessment.A peerless monster who destroyed 18 Level 2 Mechanical Puppets with his bare fists and even sent an official Level 3 Martial Artist examiner to the ICU ward.Demon, monster, pervert!Under the influence of all kinds of rumors, Lu Sheng had become a scourge in the eyes of some students.So even if he was lean, handsome, and walked in quietly, many people retreated as if they had seen a ghost.Lu Sheng walked towards the seats in the hall, and the students who had been sitting there immediately stood up and scrambled to hide from him.If one were to look down from above, it would feel as if Lu Sheng carried some kind of invisible force field with him.Wherever he passed, the crowd retreated.Lu Sheng casually found a seat and sat down.After sitting down, he was surprised to find that not everyone had run away. There was still one person who hadn\u2019t moved, sitting right next to Lu Sheng.And Lu Sheng just so happened to know this person, it was the girl, the potential spiritual master, called Xia Lin.This was the first time he was in such proximity to Xia Lin. Lu Sheng was surprised to find that this girl was quite pretty.Yang Yuan\u2019s appearance was outstanding enough, but Xia Lin\u2019s facial features were even more exquisite than hers, and her temperament was also very special.She was gentle and quiet, just like a top student in class. However, she seemed to be a little cold and her body was trembling slightly.Perhaps, the aid conditioner to be too cold for her.\u00a0Lu Sheng thought.\u2026\u201cAs expected of Xia Lin, the only spiritual master in our batch. She actually dares to sit so close to that monster, Lu Sheng!\u201d\u201cGeniuses are always proud, let alone a genius like Xia Lin.Although Lu Sheng is abnormal, I dare to bet that Xia Lin isn\u2019t afraid of him at all!\u201d\u201cIndeed \u2026\u201dXia Lin sat in her seat, trembling. She was terrified. That person \u2026 That terrifying guy \u2026 At this moment, he was sitting right next to her, less than three meters away from her. Xia Lin could almost hear his breathing.Hearing the exclamations and discussions of the crowd behind her, Xia Lin wanted to cry, but had no tears.\u00a0What pride of a genius, pride, my ass!It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t want to run or change seats, but her legs were weak, and she couldn\u2019t stand up at all!Ever since her experience at the entrance during the day, Xia Lin would occasionally recall the pair of ice-cold eyes, that side profile hidden in the darkness, and that pitiful young man who was lying on the ground like a corpse while being dragged by one of his legs.It was too scary!It was like a nightmare that she couldn\u2019t get rid of. Every time she thought of it, she would break out in cold sweat.Xia Lin couldn\u2019t control her body, her spirit curled up in her mind and trembled uncontrollably.Don\u2019t come over!Don\u2019t come over!Xia Lin shouted in her mind.\u2026\u201cLu Sheng, is it?\u201d Four or five rows behind Lu Sheng, a dark-skinned young man with a vicious look on his face stared at Lu Sheng\u2019s back.\u201cA strength-type martial artist, the early stage is indeed shocking. I wonder if your fist can penetrate my stone skin, you\u2019re welcome to try, haha \u2026\u201d The young man\u2019s eyes were burning with a crazy passion, his fighting spirit blazing.\u2026On the other side behind Lu Sheng, a handsome young man with an elegant hairstyle was also looking at Lu Sheng. Beside him, a dozen young men surrounded him like stars studding the moon.\u201cJinhe, this Lu Sheng is so arrogant, occupying so many seats by himself!\u201d\u201cBut his strength is really terrifying, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not, he beat a total of 18 Level 2 Mechanical Puppets and a Level 3 Martial Artist examiner \u2026\u201d\u201cYeah \u2026\u201dHearing the exclamations of the people around him, the handsome young man sneered and said, \u201cYou\u2019re only fit to believe in those half-baked rumors. Who know what reality lies behind them \u2026 This Lu Sheng has the strength, but his upper limit is just like that.\u201cA strength-type martial artist is basically like this, in the beginning, they are fierce and have all kinds of exaggerated achievements. But in fact, they have capped potential, by the time they get to higher level, they just become lackluster and fade out. The higher they climb, the more mundane they become.\u201d\u201cBut aren\u2019t we in the early stages as well? Won\u2019t we have to concede to him now?\u201d A young man said unwillingly.The handsome young man said faintly, \u201cNot necessarily, after entering this training camp, we\u2019ll see rapid improvements. It\u2019s a competition of potential.\u201cMy potential is definitely stronger than his, plus I\u2019m a speed-type martial artist, my advantage is very obvious. No matter how strong he is, he has to be able to keep up with my movements and speed first. Do you think that every battle will be in a narrow and claustrophobic environment like the assessment tunnel, hehe \u2026 During the assessment, I didn\u2019t even use my advantage in speed \u2026\u201dThe handsome young man smiled, his face was full of calm confidence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 \u2014 The Mentality of the Strong, the Law of Survival\u201cThat should be Cao Yong, then this must be Meng Jinhe \u2026\u201d His spiritual power spread out slightly, and the entire hall was in his sight. He could also see the expressions of the people behind him clearly.Among them, there were two particularly hostile gazes that caught Lu Sheng\u2019s attention. Of course, only a little attention.He didn\u2019t take it to heart at all.These two were just Level 2 Martial Artists. If it were two weeks ago, Lu Sheng might have taken a second look at them.But now?What\u2019s there to pay attention to when they can be killed with a casual pinch?\u201cAs I kill more and more zombies in the dream world, with the zombies are that keep getting stronger and stronger. I seem to have become more and more violent \u2026\u201dHe was not like this in the past.Just like in the assessment passageway, he was not satisfied with beating the puppets, so he beat up the examiner. If it were in the past, he would have thought about it and then guessed the identity of the other party. This unnecessary battle would not have happened.Lu Sheng pondered for a moment.He soon found the reason.A change in mentality.As his strength continued to grow, his original mentality was also quietly undergoing changes. He became stronger, so he was too lazy to consider and weight behind many things.He found everything getting much simpler when he simply used strength to resolve things.\u201cOnly the weak need to use wisdom to achieve their goals, while the strong need only their fists.\u201dIt was like there was a stone in the middle of the road. People with weak strength would think about how to move the stone away or take a detour.But the strong would not think so much. They would just kick it away.This was the mentality of the strong.Lu Sheng was surprised to find that, in a trance, he had grown to such a height. He was a completely different person from the muddle-headed and submissive young man.As he was thinking, two people walked in from outside the hall. It was a man and a woman, both wearing dark blue military uniforms.Lu Sheng noticed the epaulets on their shoulders, which were the epaulets only officers were qualified to wear. And to be qualified to obtain such a rank in a military region, one must be at least Level 5 Martial Artist.He clearly remembered his previous life experience. Even if he had a lot of military achievements, he was still a lieutenant when he died. Because he was only a Level 4 Martial Artist at the time.[Talking about the Photon Mind results from the Fireseed Repository in the previous chapters.]This man and woman were both quite good-looking, and their bodies were filled with powerful auras. After the two of them entered, the noisy hall quickly quieted down.\u201cI\u2019m the chief instructor of the Dongning Provincial Capital\u2019s Prodigy Training Camp, Dong Qingxue. This is the deputy chief instructor, Major Qin Shaojun \u2026\u201dThe woman went straight to the point and introduced herself.Lu Sheng had seen both of them once, when he had just finished his entrance examination.The beautiful Dong Qingxue said coldly, \u201cIn the coming days, the two of us will be in charge of your training. Next, I\u2019ll briefly explain the rules of this training camp \u2026\u201cFirst, we will not interfere with your training and day-to-day life. You are all top martial arts geniuses in your respective cities, and I believe that everyone should have a set of cultivation methods that are most suitable for you, as well as your daily routines.\u201cThere won\u2019t be any classes in this training camp. You\u2019ll have to rely on yourselves to cultivate.\u201cTo put it bluntly, we won\u2019t care even if you guys sleep in the dorm every day \u2026\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s expression became a little strange hearing that. Although he knew it was impossible, he still felt that this sentence was directed at him.The first rule caused an uproar among the students. Many people began discussing it vehemently.\u201cNo classes? Then what are we here for? To waste our time?\u201d\u201cFuck! Might as well stay at home. At least you\u2019ll have a tutor to guide you one-on-one \u2026\u201d\u201cHow can this be?\u201dDong Qingxue coldly interrupted everyone\u2019s discussion.\u201cIt\u2019s not too late to leave now.\u201dThe discussion stopped. Although there were many opinions, everyone had racked their brains to get here. How could they bear to leave?\u201cThen I\u2019ll continue \u2026\u201dDong Qingxue continued, \u201cSecond, you\u2019ll have to spend a corresponding amount of points for all your daily needs in the training camp. Every meal you eat, every dorm you stay in, the water you use for bathing, the toilet paper you use \u2026 Everything has to be paid for.\u201cHowever, this money will be replaced by points. To put it simply, in the training camp, you\u2019ll need points for everything you need, and points can be exchanged for everything. Even \u2026\u201dDong Qingxue paused for a moment, then swept her cold gaze across everyone in the hall. She enunciated each word clearly, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like someone in the training camp and fight with them in private, and accidentally kill them, you\u2019ll have to pay back your points. You can also use points to pay for it.\u201cOf course, after you leave the training camp, we won\u2019t be responsible if the person\u2019s family comes looking for trouble with you.\u201dThe youths were as silent as cicadas in winter. They were so shocked by Dong Qingxue\u2019s words that they could not utter a single word.Although they were geniuses and official martial artists \u2026However, when the cold word \u2018kill\u2019 was thrown in front of them, they could not help but feel afraid.Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes lit up bit by bit. A faint smile even appeared at the corner of his lips.Interesting. This training camp is very interesting.In this advanced concrete forest, such a simple and cruel set of laws of the jungle was set up. Lu Sheng felt as if he had been thrown into a survival game.The show had just begun.\u201cThen how do we get our points?\u201d Finally, someone asked.\u201cGood question.\u201d Dong Qingxue said calmly, \u201cThere are many ways to get points. First, you can get the approval of me, Major Qin Shaojun, or any other instructor in the training camp. As long as we think you\u2019ve done well enough in a certain aspect, we\u2019ll give you a certain amount of points based on our mood.\u201cSecond, you can pass the assessment. We\u2019ll assess you from time to time. As long as you pass, you\u2019ll get a lot of points.\u201cThe entrance exam during the day is one of them. Four of you have passed the examination. The points have been given to your respective identity cards, which are your room cards. You can check them when you get back.\u201cThird, you can help the base with various internal work. To put it simply, you\u2019ll be doing odd jobs. However, the points you\u2019ll get through this method will be marginal at best. It\u2019s far less than the previous two methods.\u201dAfter Dong Qingxue finished speaking, there was another round of heated discussion below.\u201cFinally, I\u2019ll explain in detail what you can do with your points \u2026\u201dEveryone pricked up their ears.Through Dong Qingxue\u2019s introduction, everyone learned that apart from being able to exchange for various daily necessities, like food, and resting in dorms, points could also be exchanged for guidance from the base instructors, including the strongest instructors, Dong Qingxue and Qin Shaojun.They could also be exchanged to buy time in some special cultivation rooms in the base.That was what Lu Sheng was most interested in. However, Dong Qingxue only briefly mentioned it in her introduction. He would have to slowly understand it himself.Points could also be exchanged for various privileges. There was no need to mention the privilege to kill. It was too extreme and basically no one would use it.Lu Sheng guessed that although Dong Qingxue had said that before, if he really killed someone in the base, he would still be dealt with the same way when he got out.Also, points could even be exchanged for a guaranteed admission to Dongning University and the Eastern Military University.That was rather exaggerated. It was equivalent to being able to enter a famous university without having to take the college entrance exam.However, on second thought, it was useless.Those who had the ability to obtain these points in the training camp could easily get into the province\u2019s university through the college entrance examination.After the introduction, Dong Qingxue did not waste any time. After announcing the end of her talk, she left with Qin Shaojun.The remaining students began to discuss the few rules that Dong Qingxue had just mentioned.Most of them were from the same city. Lu Sheng saw Yang Yuan and the others from Baihe City consciously moving closer to him. He ignored them and walked out of the hall.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64: Whetstone\u201cSigh \u2026\u201d Looking at Lu Sheng\u2019s back as he left, Yang Yuan could not help but sigh, even though she had already guessed it.\u201cThis Lu Sheng is too arrogant. He doesn\u2019t put us in his eyes at all.\u201d Someone from Baihe City said angrily.\u201cWho told him to be so strong? There\u2019s still a reward for passing the assessment. He doesn\u2019t have to worry about points in the short term \u2026\u201d Someone said sourly.\u201cNo matter how many points he has, there will be a day when they will be used up. No matter how strong he is, he is strong only for now. He\u2019s not the only one who passed the assessment. Baoding City\u2019s Xia Lin, Yanglin City\u2019s Cao Yong, Donggang City\u2019s Meng Jinhe, which one of them is weaker than him? Even if they are not as strong as him for now, they will catch up sooner or later in the training camp.\u201cEveryone has the support of a team while he is alone. When someone comes to find trouble with him, let\u2019s see how he will deal with it alone. Maybe he will even beg us for help \u2026\u201d\u201cHaha, what you said makes sense.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m starting to look forward to Lu Sheng\u2019s expression at that time.\u201dYang Yuan listened to the discussions going on around her and remained silent.The analysis these people made seemed to make sense, but they had overlooked a very important point.Without the support of someone like Lu Sheng in the early stages, this group of \u201cgeniuses\u201d who were at the bottom of their respective cities might not be able to hold on until the day Lu Sheng\u2019s power declined.\u201cHe\u2019s finally gone \u2026 That terrifying guy.\u201d \u00a0Xia Ling let out a long sigh of relief. It was as if a heavy burden had been lifted from her heart. She felt much more relaxed.As long as Lu Sheng appeared by her side, Xia Lin would feel uncomfortable all over, as if she couldn\u2019t breathe. Now that Lu Sheng was gone, she began to slowly return to her original appearance as a genius.The students from Baoding City consciously gathered around her. As the recognized number one genius among them, Xia Lin naturally became the core of the students from Baoding City.Xia Lin was quietly listening to the discussions and analysis of her companions. Suddenly, someone patted her on the shoulder and reminded her.\u201cXia Lin, the chief instructor wants you to look for her after you\u2019re done. She has something important to tell you.\u201d\u201cUh \u2026 Oh, oh, I got it.\u201dXia Lin blinked. She did not know why the Chief Instructor Dong Qingxue was suddenly looking for her.The students next to her had a look of envy on their faces. He didn\u2019t need to guess to know that the chief instructor was looking for Xia Lin for something good.Everyone knew that Xia Lin had a rare and powerful talent as a spiritual master, and Chief Instructor Dong Qingxue \u2026 she was a powerful spiritual master.\u201cI reckon that in a day or two, all the odd jobs in the base will be taken care of by these little bastards \u2026\u201d Qin Shaojun said to Dong Qingxue as she stood under the streetlamp and looked at the brightly lit Great Hall in the distance.\u201cThis is also a way to dampen their arrogance and temper their will. It can only be beneficial to them.\u201d Dong Qingxue said calmly.\u201cAfter becoming the chief instructor, your words have become more and more powerful \u2026\u201d Qin Shaojun sighed.Dong Qingxue rolled her eyes at him in exasperation. Then, with a serious expression, she said, \u201cI think I\u2019ve got it.\u201d\u201cGot what?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve thought of how to deal with Lu Sheng.\u201d\u201cOh?!\u201d Qin Shaojun\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cWhat do you plan to do with him?\u201dThe appearance of a freak like Lu Sheng was completely out of their expectations.On the one hand, although Lu Sheng\u2019s talent was outstanding, his potential was limited. It was not worth the military spending too much effort on him, but it was not good to give up completely.On the other hand, Lu Sheng\u2019s was too strong. He was not on the same level as the other students. If he were to compete with this group of people, he would probably not feel any pressure at all.Therefore, the question of how to properly nurture a seedling like Lu Sheng had always been a headache for the two of them.Now that Dong Qingxue said that she had an idea, Qin Shaojun was naturally curious.\u201cA whetstone!\u201dDong Qingxue\u2019s eyes sparkled under the streetlamp\u2019s light. She said word by word, \u201cHe\u2019s the best whetstone. He can stimulate others to grow faster.\u201dQin Shaojun looked thoughtful. He asked, \u201cThen have you considered a problem? What if this whetstone is too strong and hard? What if it breaks the blade that it\u2019s supposed to sharpen?\u201d\u201cWhich is why he can\u2019t just be a whetstone for one person.\u201d Dong Qingxue looked at Qin Shaojun and said confidently, \u201cXia Lin, Cao Yong, Meng Jinhe. Three blades together. If that\u2019s not enough, we\u2019ll add a few more talented martial artists. I don\u2019t believe that they won\u2019t be able to withstand his pressure.\u201cIf this plan works well, the results of this year\u2019s Prodigy Training Camp might far exceed our expectations. And Lu Sheng would also have very likely raised his upper limit.\u201cA fierce Level 6 Martial Artist in actual combat is ultimately not as significant as a Level 7 Master.\u201cNo matter how weak a Master is in actual combat, he can easily defeat ten peak Level 6 Martial Artists, no matter the latter\u2019s strong combat awareness.\u201dQin Shaojun looked thoughtful.\u201cI\u2019m going to give Xia Lin basic training as a spirit master tonight. You can focus on Meng Jinhe. You two have the same specialization.\u201d Dong Qingxue said.Qin Shaojun nodded. \u201cWhat about Cao Yong and the others?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll find a way to get Qi Meng\u2019s cultivation experience for Cao Yong. I\u2019ll even let Qi Meng personally guide him online. As for the other seedlings \u2026\u201dDong Qingxue thought for a moment and said, \u201cGive them more points secretly.\u201dQin Shaojun looked at Dong Qingxue with a complicated expression and said, \u201cI can see that you really want to lead this training camp well.\u201dDong Qingxue said calmly, \u201cSince it\u2019s a task assigned to me, I\u2019ll naturally do my best. It\u2019s not my style to do things half-heartedly.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case \u2026\u201d Qin Shaojun seemed to have made a decision. He said seriously, \u201cThen I won\u2019t be a burden to you. From today onward, I\u2019m no longer a slacker! I\u2019ll work hard to be the best martial arts instructor!\u201dDong Qingxue smiled and said with relief, \u201cIf you had this kind of awareness earlier, your progress in martial arts would definitely be \u2026\u201dBefore she could finish, she saw Qin Shaojun frown and think carefully. Then, he shook his head and said, \u201cForget it. I\u2019m a little tired because of Lu Sheng today. I\u2019ll stop being a slacker from tomorrow onward. I\u2019ll go back to sleep first \u2026\u201dThe smile on Dong Qingxue\u2019s face instantly froze.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u2026After Lu Sheng returned to the dormitory, the first thing he did was check the points Dong Qingxue had mentioned at the assembly.\u201cSo many?\u201dLu Sheng was a little surprised when he saw the results. There were a total of 1,000 points.He did not know how many points the other three people who passed the entrance exam had received, but this number was quite a lot.After the assembly, the officer of the training camp gave everyone a form.It listed all the facilities and activities in the training camp, and whether points were needed for certain facilities, and if needed, how many? The ways and jobs to earn points, and how many points could be earned.Lu Sheng looked at the introduction on the form.A meal in the training camp (buffet) only cost 5 points. A night\u2019s sleep was even cheaper. One point was enough. In other words, if one was only satisfied with three meals a day and sleeping.These 1,000 points were enough for Lu Sheng to stay in the training camp for close to three months.\u201cBut if I want to use the special cultivation room or get the instructor to guide me, it won\u2019t be cheap \u2026\u201dGravity Training Room cost 10 points per hourAgility Training Room cost 10 points per hour.Combat Training Room cost 20 points per hour.Instruction from a normal instructor cost 30 points per hour.Instruction for the chief instructor and the deputy chief instructor cost 100 point to instruct him once.\u2026On the other hand, there were other ways to earn points. The points provided by the assessment were quite considerable.For every assessment, no matter how big or small it was, as long as one passed, one would receive 20 points.If one achieved good results in the assessment, one would receive 50 points.If one achieved outstanding results, one would receive 100 points.Of course, the entrance exam had just ended. It was obviously unrealistic to try to earn points in a short period of time through the assessment. Thus, one could only go through other methods, such as doing chores.However, the points one could earn through this method were pitifully low. Cleaning the training room only gave him 5 points.Even the smallest martial arts training room in the training camp was a few hundred square meters.Lu Sheng suddenly felt a little sorry for the students who did not pass the entrance exam and had zero points. He could foresee that for a long time, these people would have to rely on cleaning to make ends meet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 \u2014 Arm Like a Spear, Warrior with Elemental TalentLu Sheng focused on checking the introductions of the special cultivation rooms. Among them, he was most interested in the Gravity Training Room and the Agility Training Room.According to the introduction of the information, these two training rooms were very effective for a martial artist\u2019s BQV and speed.Lu Sheng didn\u2019t lack inheritance [memories of cultivation and other method], experience, or supplements at all. What he lacked most was this kind of rare environment to assist his cultivation.If he could make good use of it, his cultivation speed would be greatly improved.\u201cI\u2019ll check it out tomorrow. Anyway, I have a lot of points to spare.\u201d Lu Sheng made up his mind. He threw the room card and the form aside and began his daily cultivation routine.He practiced the Stellar Body Refining Technique and the Natural Breathing Technique over and over again, tirelessly.With the continuous improvement of Lu Sheng\u2019s strength and the continuous unearthing of his potential by the Natural Breathing Technique, the burden of Stellar Body Refining Technique on him was getting smaller and smaller.If he only practiced Stellar Body Refining Technique alone, it would take a long time to completely squeeze out all of his latent physical strength.It was a far cry from the situation where he was so tired that he didn\u2019t even want to move a finger after practicing it a few times in the beginning.This also meant that the effect of the introductory chapter of Stellar Body Refining Technique on Lu Sheng was getting weaker and weaker \u2026In the Dream World.On a dilapidated street, Lu Sheng was fighting with four or five figures. All the remaining tough ones in the two nearby streets were attracted by his breath.Lu Sheng moved nimbly among several zombies, punching and attacking from time to time. The body technique that broke through the bottleneck was of great help to Lu Sheng in actual combat.Any of the five zombies in front of him was more powerful than Lu Sheng in terms of pure strength.The strongest one was a tall zombie with half dark red headband on its head. Its strength was several times greater than Lu Sheng\u2019s.Lu Sheng didn\u2019t dare to take its fists directly. He could only rely on his position and the other zombies to keep contending with it.As time went by, the number of zombies in the battle group kept decreasing.Lu Sheng, who has established his Absolute Martial Path, he had almost no obvious shortcomings. No matter what part or form of attack he faced, he could deal with it skilfully.His brain was working very fast. The various fists, legwork, and palm techniques that were categorized in his memory kept surging and turning into the purest battle instincts. Lu Sheng casually grasped them and wantonly used them.The essence of martial arts was the body. As long as one\u2019s speed and strength were fast enough, all moves would be useless.However, if his speed and strength were not as good as his opponent\u2019s, he would need to use his skills to make up for it.Powerful techniques were the capital for martial arts geniuses to challenge those of a higher level.Lu Sheng was now relying on his powerful skills to bully these zombies whose brains had withered and shriveled up.When I was in the passageway, I was up against the Level 3 Martial Artist examiner.Although his opponent was caught off guard, he was still able to knock him out within a few moves.It was a complete suppression.As someone who cultivates the Absolute Martial Path, my techniques are far superior to that of ordinary martial artists. Unless my opponent can kill me with a single slap, there is always a possibility of me fighting back.But against these zombies who didn\u2019t even have consciousness and only had a little fighting instinct left, it was still so difficult to fight \u2026Just how terrifying were these guys when they were alive?!Lu Sheng fiercely punched the headband zombie in front of him.Perfection Realm Fist Technique, six times Stellar Generation, Natural Breathing Technique, Spiritual perception \u2026With all these enhancements, this punch represented Lu Sheng\u2019s current maximum combat power.He didn\u2019t know the exact value of his combat power, but it was definitely over 100,000.The fist tore through the air, making a sharp and ear-piercing sound. It was so fast that the naked eye couldn\u2019t catch it.Boom!This punch fiercely hit the zombie\u2019s head. The headband on the zombie\u2019s head instantly caved in and disintegrated. Then, the entire head exploded with a bang. The headless zombie maintained its punching posture and fell heavily.Its body weathered, leaving only a thick and long black smoke that entered Lu Sheng\u2019s body \u2026\u201cPhew \u2026\u201d After Lu Sheng finished absorbing the zombie\u2019s memories, he let out a long breath and opened his eyes. There was a complicated expression on his face.\u201cNo wonder it\u2019s so strong \u2026\u201dAccording to the memories, this headband zombie\u2019s strength had probably reached Level 6 when it was alive. It was equivalent to Xiao Yuhe, the president of Baihe City\u2019s Martial Arts Association.One step higher, and it would\u2019ve been a Master Martial Artist.\u201cIt\u2019s already so strong before reaching the level of Mater. If I hadn\u2019t used all my spiritual power to block that punch just now, I\u2019m afraid I wouldn\u2019t have been able to take it \u2026\u201d Thinking about it, Lu Sheng couldn\u2019t help but feel a lingering fear.In the last exchange of blows with the headband zombie, the headband zombie was actually about to hit him.It was just that he used his spiritual power to shift the zombie\u2019s fist a few inches, causing the zombie\u2019s attack to miss. That was how he killed it.\u201cSpiritual power is still very useful. No wonder spiritual masters are so powerful. This is the most basic use of spiritual power, but it can only be used on zombies. If it was a real Level 6 Pseudo-Master, the effect wouldn\u2019t have been that great \u2026\u201dA real Level 6 Martial Artist\u2019s strength would be much stronger than a zombie\u2019s. With a combat power of more than 500,000, Lu Sheng\u2019s spiritual power probably wouldn\u2019t be able to change the trajectory of such an opponent\u2019s fist.Two streets were completely cleared by Lu Sheng. He gained a lot of valuable martial arts memories.Lu Sheng didn\u2019t waste any time and sat on the ground to practice Crystal Contemplation Method. It would be best to practice Crystal Contemplation after absorbing the zombies\u2019 memories.After one session, whether it was the Absolute Martial Path or his spiritual power, both would\u2019ve been greatly improved.In his mind, the crystal figure that was once again dyed black breathed and became transparent little by little.When Lu Sheng opened his eyes again, the clarity in his eyes became more obvious, as if they were carved out of crystals.This was a sign that his spiritual power had improved again.\u201cMy spiritual power has improved by more than 30%, and two aspects of the Absolute Martial Path have broken through. My overall strength has risen again.\u201d Lu Sheng was quite satisfied.He had gained a lot this time, especially the memories provided by the headband zombie. The headband zombie was a master of spear techniques when he was alive, and his attainments in spear techniques were quite deep.This time, the memory absorption directly pushed Lu Sheng\u2019s understanding of spear techniques to the point where it was second only to the fist techniques.\u201cAlthough I haven\u2019t touched a real spear so far, I\u2019ll be able to use it sooner or later. On the battlefield with mutated beasts, the spear is recognized as a weapon of mass destruction. And it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t use it at all now \u2026\u201dLu Sheng suddenly punched out.His fist made a sharp sound in the air, like a weapon tearing through the air.\u201cUsing my arm as a spear! It\u2019s also useful for fighting bare-handed!\u201dAfter sorting out his gains, Lu Sheng stood up and returned to his temporary base in the Dream World.Actually, it was where he stored his Photon Mind. During this time, Lu Sheng had been using the Photon Mind to look up all kinds of information in the Dream World besides fighting and training.It could also be considered a leisure activity.As Lu Sheng looked up more and more information on the Photon Mind, his understanding of the martial arts\u2019 development in the next ten thousand years also deepened.For example, Lu Sheng had been hearing people talk about Gifted Martial Artists recently.\u201cThe appearance of Gifted Martial Artists is actually a manifestation of human evolution. Martial arts itself is a process of constantly discovering the human body\u2019s potential, constantly promoting one\u2019s own evolution. In this process, the body will have all kinds of inconceivable changes, all of which are normal.\u201dNow that martial arts have been around for three hundred years, Gifted Martial Artists are rare and precious, and the appearance of one is already amazing.For example, Lu Sheng\u2019s Baihe City, if not for him, there wouldn\u2019t even be one from the last ten years. But in the future, Gifted Martial Artists might not be everywhere, but at least they wouldn\u2019t be considered rare.Moreover, the talents awakened by Gifted Martial Artists are also divided into high and low ranks.\u201cThe worst are the strength-type talents, fierce in the early stages, but mediocre in the later stages. \u00a0Unless it\u2019s an extremely abnormal strength-type talent, it\u2019s an existence at the bottom of all talents.\u201cNext are the defense-type and agility-type talents, these two talents are slightly better than strength-type talents, the potential for growth is greater, and the upper limit for them is higher \u2026\u201dThis time, there were two talents in the ProdigyTraining Camp.Actually, whether it\u2019s strength, defense, or speed, these talents were still okay, it can only be said that some aspects are more outstanding than normal people, but still within the range of normal people.Going further, it got a bit ridiculous.\u201cElemental-type talents?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66 \u2014 I An a Master, Immortal Golden BodyLu Sheng looked at this part of the introduction with some surprise.Compared to the strength, agility, and defensive type martial artists, these elemental type martial artists were the real monsters, the new breed of humans.\u201cElemental type martial artists have the terrifying ability to control wind, fire, ice, thunder, and other natural elements. Their growth and upper limit are more than ten times that of ordinary martial artists! Isn\u2019t this similar to superpowers and mutants?\u201dLu Sheng couldn\u2019t help but exclaim.According to the data, even in the coming ten thousand years of martial arts, elemental type martial artists were extremely rare.Finally, there were the spiritual masters that Lu Sheng was familiar with. In fact, spiritual masters were also a type of martial artist. They were the rarest, most precious, and most powerful existences among martial artists.But in the coming ten thousand years, a mature, systematic method of cultivating spiritual power would be\u00a0\u00a0developed.(For example: Crystal Contemplation Method)*[*left as intended by the author]Anyone with a little talent could try to cultivate it. Therefore, in the future, the number of spiritual masters would be much greater than elemental type martial artists.\u201cWhether it be a Gifted Martial Artist or an ordinary martial artist, in the end, both worked towards the same end.\u201d \u00a0Lu Sheng said to himself after he finished reading the info.\u201cIn the early stages of martial arts, Gifted Martial Artists may have an absolute advantage over ordinary martial artists. But in fact, the further you go, the less obvious this advantage becomes. As far as I know, Level 7 Masters and Level 8 Grandmasters.\u201cTheir blood and Qi would be as vigorous as gushing rivers. A punch can shatter mountains and sunder the earth, and change the course of a river. They are invulnerable to bullets. Isn\u2019t this equivalent to the embodiment of all three attributes of strength, defence, and agility?\u201cFurther up, Level 9 Martial Sages, Level Ten, and Level 11 Star Realm experts have all kinds of incredible magical means. It isn\u2019t impossible for them to call the wind, summon the rain, and control thunder. How is it any worse than elemental type martial artists?\u201cThose with strong martial will, can even control and stimulate their cells to evolve. Can an ordinary spiritual master do that?\u201cMartial Dao cultivation is simply a different path that leads to the same goal. In the end, it\u2019s all about digging out one\u2019s own potential, unlocking the treasures of the human body, and promoting one\u2019s existence \u2026\u201dLu Sheng himself was the best example.He cultivated the Stellar Body Refining Technique and the Natural Breathing Technique, which caused his BQV to skyrocket. His CPI was far beyond ordinary people, so the outside world mistook him for a strength type martial artist.In fact, he knew better than anyone whether he was or not.\u201cMortals like to categorize all the incredible things that happen to others as gifts and miracles, when in fact \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng clenched his fists, his eyes glinting. \u201cWhat kind of talent can compare to one\u2019s own hard work and wisdom? Martial arts itself is the greatest miracle of the human race!\u201dClosing the introduction to the innate martial artists on the Photon Mind, Lu Sheng suddenly remembered that it had been a long time since he had checked his life history.Thinking of this, he gave a command to the Photon Mind.\u201cShow me my personal information.\u201d[Retrieving \u2026][Name: Lu Sheng][Gender: Male][Lifespan: June 297 M.C. \u2013 March 452 M.C.][Martial Prowess: Level 7 Martial Artist][Life Summary: \u2026 Became a Level 2 Martial Artist at the age of 18, causing a sensation in Baihe City. Later, under the recommendation of the Baihe City Martial Arts Association, he participated in the Dongning Province\u2019s Prodigy Training Camp and obtained first place.In the same year, he entered the Dongning University of Martial Arts securing the highest score in the city, coming 1st in the province, and 53rd in the country in the college entrance examination.\u2026He became a Level 6 Warrior at the age of 40. Becoming a Level 7 Master at the age of 65 \u2026\u2026In July, Year 452 M.C., an old injury flared up. He passed away at the age of 156.]Hum!Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes suddenly shone with a strong light, and a hint of excitement flashed between his brows.Level 7 Master!This time, his future had changed again. He had actually set foot in the Level 7 Master realm in his lifetime!A Master!In ancient times, he would be considered a feudal lord. Even now, he would be an important figure. If he became an official, he could easily take on important provincial tasks. If he joined the army, he would be a general in the military ranks.In other words, even if Lu Sheng only followed the prescribed path now, he could at least become a Master in the future.How could he not be shocked by this?If it were anyone else, if they knew that they would definitely become a Master in this lifetime, they would probably be so happy that they would fall to the ground.\u201cPhew \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng took a deep breath, trying hard to calm down the excitement in his heart. \u201cSince I\u2019ve become a Master, my evaluation and authority should have increased again \u2026\u201dSure enough, he continued to read.Lu Sheng\u2019s historical evaluation had indeed reached three stars. His authority had also reached Level 3.\u201cLevel 3 authority, then the techniques I can search for in the Fireseed Repository must be of a higher level \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng was quite happy and quickly commanded Photon Mind.\u201cSearch for the follow-up techniques of Stellar Body Refining Technique, Natural Breathing Technique, and Crystal Contemplation Method.\u201d[Retrieving \u2026]Sure enough, Photon Mind did not prompt him that his authority was insufficient this time.Not long after, three techniques were found and presented in front of Lu Sheng.[Stellar Physical Refinement Technique (Advanced)][Technique Introduction: Created by Martial Alliance Level 11 powerhouse, Wang He. Included in the Fireseed Plan.][Natural Breathing Technique (Advanced)][Technique Introduction: Created by Martial Alliance Level 11 powerhouse, Yang Yizhou. Included in the Fireseed Plan.][Crystal Contemplation Method (Advanced)][Technique Introduction: Created by Martial Alliance Level 11 powerhouse, Duan Yifeng. Included in the Fireseed Plan.]Lu Sheng clicked on the Stellar Body Refining Technique\u2019s advanced chapter. With just one glance, his breathing quickened.\u201cForging an eternal will of the unextinguished stars, creating an indestructible Immortal Golden Body \u2026\u201dImmortal Golden Body, Stellar Body Refining Technique \u2013 Tendons and Bones Refinement Chapter.Lu Sheng had known for a long time that once a martial artist reached Level 3, they would begin to refine their tendons and bones.This was also the stage where a martial artist truly laid the foundation, widened the gap, and transformed. This was because at Level 4, a martial artist\u2019s inner strength was born from their flesh, blood, tendons, and bones.How well their tendons and bones were refined was directly related to their inner strength and the gap in their combat strength.And in the Stellar Body Refinement Technique\u2019s advanced chapter, there was actually a technique specially created for this stage \u2026 It was called the Immortal Golden Body!\u201cIf I can successfully refine my body using the advanced chapter, I can improve all aspects of my body to an incomparably shocking level. And this stage of training should also be the true foundation for the Stellar Body Refinement Technique\u2019s future development \u2026 where one can reach the realm of immortality and indestructibility, where cellular regeneration is possible, and the physical body becomes invincible.\u201dThinking about it carefully, it felt normal.The Stellar Body Refinement Technique claimed that when cultivated to the end, one\u2019s body would contain the mighty power of a star. If one\u2019s body was not strong enough, how could one store a star?He was afraid that the heat wave released during cultivation would burn him to death.Lu Sheng roughly checked the specific cultivation process of this stage of the Stellar Body Refinement Technique.He suddenly found that the new movements unlocked were many times more difficult than before, and many of them needed to be done together with the stimulation of mental strength to be effective.\u201cSure enough, the road of martial arts leads to the same destination but by different means. Physical training is also inseparable from the assistance of mental strength.\u201cFrom another perspective, the Stellar Body Refinement Technique\u2019s cultivation threshold is also very high. Not just anyone can practice it. At the very least, one must have the talent of a Spiritual Master \u2026\u201dLu Sheng sighed and continued to look at the Natural Breathing Technique\u2019s advanced chapter, and released another suffocated noise.\u201cSo powerful!\u201dAfter reading the contents of the Natural Breathing Technique\u2019s advanced chapter, Lu Sheng could only say these two words.The Natural Breathing Technique, which was slightly mediocre in the entry stage, finally bloomed in the advanced chapter . It was not inferior to the dazzling brilliance of the other two Level 11 techniques.The entire advanced technique of the Natural Breathing Technique only taught one thing, and that was \u2026 How to cultivate the special inner strength!\u201cWhen a martial artist is promoted from Level 3 to Level 4, although the increase in BQV is not much, the CPI will undergo a qualitative transformation. It is because of the appearance of the inner strength!\u201dAt this stage, the gap between the martial artist widened irrevocably.The inner strength cultivated by a Gifted Martial Artist with a solid foundation and outstanding talent would far surpass that of an ordinary martial artist.Among them, some people could even carry special attribute abilities to their inner strength. Of course, this could only be done by those martial artists with elemental type talents, who were said to be rarer than pandas.It was also because of this that martial artists with elemental type talents had a crushing advantage in the early stages of martial arts.The advanced technique of the Natural Breathing Technique described how an ordinary martial artist could achieve the same level as an elemental martial artist.Let one\u2019s inner strength carry special attributes, or even surpass that! And there was more than one special attribute that could be switched back and forth!\u201cCommunicate with nature, find the elemental attributes that are compatible with oneself, and thus transform the inner strength \u2026 Not only that, the Natural Breathing Technique can also continuously refine the inner strength, making the quality of the inner strength of the practitioner ten times, tens of times, or even a hundred times higher than that of an ordinary martial artist!\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s heart was surging, and he could not calm down for a long time.This method of creating elemental talent martial artists could already be described as reshaping one\u2019s foundation, seizing heaven\u2019s fortune, and so on.On the other hand, the advanced chapter of the Crystal Contemplation Method was a bit mediocre compared to the previous two.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 \u2013 Divine Illumination Meditation Scripture, an Unimaginably Terrifying Martial Arts Technique!The content of the advanced chapter of Crystal Contemplation Method was just to replace the crystal figure with a stronger diamond figure. The spiritual power cultivated this way would be purer and stronger.The three advanced cultivation techniques brought Lu Sheng too many surprises, each more powerful than the last.For a while, Lu Sheng didn\u2019t know which part to start cultivating. Just when Lu Sheng felt that he had gained a lot, he suddenly remembered a very important thing.\u201cRight, with the increase in authority, I should be able to check the combat skills of a spiritual master \u2026\u201dThinking of this, Lu Sheng immediately ordered: \u201cBring up all the combat skills suitable for a Level 2 Spiritual Master \u2026\u201d[Retrieving \u2026]In just a few seconds, a large amount of content appeared in front of Lu Sheng.[Silver Sky Shuttle, Endless Blade Wheel, Hexagonal Star Awl \u2026]Lu Sheng read the content one by one, his eyes became brighter and brighter, but his eyebrows slowly wrinkled.\u201cHow could this be? Is the combat threshold of a spiritual master so high?\u201d Lu Sheng was a little depressed.It wasn\u2019t that these skills weren\u2019t strong enough, nor that they weren\u2019t suitable for him, but \u2026 He currently didn\u2019t meet the conditions to practice these skills.\u201cAlmost every type of combat skill suited for a spiritual master needs to be paired with a corresponding weapon. And the manufacturing of these special weapons has very high requirements, which involves a variety of designs, concepts \u2026 must be customized by a professional, and the materials used to create various weapons also have requirements \u2026 Damn! Spiritual master is simply a pay-to-win profession!\u201dHe now finally knew that the strength of a spiritual master wasn\u2019t just based on the spiritual master himself, but also closely related to the development of contemporary martial arts technology.The manufacturing of many weapons had very high requirements for smelting technology, and with the current level of martial arts technology, it may not be possible to make them.Not to mention those special materials that were rare even in the next ten thousand years.Lu Sheng didn\u2019t give up and continued to give orders: \u201cScreen for spiritual weapons that can be made in the first 300 years of the martial calender.\u201d[Screening \u2026]The content in front of him was greatly reduced, leaving only a few types. Lu Sheng simply glanced and continued to give instructions.\u201cSearch for corresponding weapon material production location, simulated environment, three hundred years of martial arts.\u201d\u201cSearch for corresponding materials, production location, in the first 300 years of the martial calender.\u201d This was the first time Lu Sheng was screening for information in this manner.This already involved the geographical changes of martial arts over ten thousand years, and the location of precious minerals deposits. He didn\u2019t know if it would work.But the result was unexpected.There really was one.\u201cI\u2019ve checked the locations of all possible strategic resources in the past three hundred years of martial arts \u2026\u201dThankfully, the materials for spiritual weapons were directly listed as a strategic resources.Lu Sheng carefully looked at the exquisite and detailed map in front of him. He was surprised to find that there were many marked points on the map that belonged to Dongning Province. Among them were the places where the materials he needed were produced.\u201cAfter that, I\u2019ll go online to check, or I\u2019ll go there personally to see if it\u2019s been discovered or occupied \u2026\u201dOf course, this would have to wait until the training camp was over.Since the materials were available, the only problem left to solve was the problem of crafting.\u201cRelying on myself to create these weapons is definitely not realistic. I can only rely on the military or the government. So it seems \u2026\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cI have to find a chance to show off my talent as a spiritual master,\u201d he said to himself. The stronger one\u2019s talent was, the more resources one could get. This had always been the rule in the martial arts world.\u201cSpeaking of which, did any of the Level 11 powerhouses advance from spiritual master route? What kind of technique did they use?\u201dAs Lu Sheng thought of this, he changed his method and commanded the A.I., Photon Mind: \u201cPull up the spiritual master cultivation system that has been included in the Fireseed Program!\u201d[Retrieving \u2026]Lu Sheng stared at the blue screen in front of him and read the contents displayed.He knew that those that could be included in Fireseed Program were the true essence and core of martial arts for the next ten thousand years.He really wanted to know what kind of earth-shattering methods the people who stood at the peak as spiritual masters ten thousand years in the future had.\u201cCrystal Contemplation Method has been included in Fireseed Repository \u2026\u201d The first thing that appeared was the Crystal Contemplation Method that Lu Sheng had been practicing all this time.\u201cAs expected, Crystal Contemplation Method is the highest scripture for spiritual masters \u2026\u201dThere was very little content this time. Lu Sheng thought that there would be no result. However, he did not expect that there to be another one after Crystal Contemplation Method.[Divine Illumination Meditation Scripture.][Technique Introduction: Created by the Level 11 powerhouse Duan Yifeng of the World Martial Alliance. Included in the Fireseed Program.]Divine Illumination Meditation Scripture \u2026 Level 11 technique \u2026 Duan Yifeng \u2026 It was the same person as the creator of Crystal Visualization.Lu Sheng was stunned.He searched for it with the intention of giving it a try, but he did not expect to find such a huge surprise.Moreover, this Divine Illumination Meditation Scripture was not incomplete, but complete!In other words, Lu Sheng had directly obtained a complete Level 11 inheritance!\u201cThen why didn\u2019t it appear when I searched for it earlier?\u201d Lu Sheng muttered and began to read this technique. When he finished reading the entire technique, he could not find the words to describe the shock in his heart.\u201cBold, unconstrained, and unimaginable!\u201dThis was Lu Sheng\u2019s evaluation of this technique. Of course, it was also unimaginably powerful.\u201cNo wonder it didn\u2019t appear when I searched for battle techniques. Although this technique is within the scope of a spiritual master, it is also specially made for battle, but it is not completely a combat technique \u2026\u201dThe core of Divine Illumination Meditation Scriputre was very simple, so simple that it could be summarized in one sentence: Using spirit power to build another body in the martial artist\u2019s body. A body that was completely woven out of spiritual power.It could also be called a clone.And the precision of this spirit powered body could reach the level of muscle fibers, cells, and even genes \u2026 and there was only one use for building such a spirit powered cloneTo strengthen oneself!To strengthen oneself in all aspects without any blind spots! To double one\u2019s ability in the truest sense!The first level of Divine Illumination Meditation Scripture was to use spiritual power to accelerate the body\u2019s circulation, thus achieving the effect of increasing vitality.Increasing vitality!*[* can be inferred as BQV]When Lu Sheng first saw it, he thought he had seen wrongly.One had to know that all the methods he had come into contact with, all the methods that could be achieved, and all the methods that could be used to increase vitality in any sense.They were all used to increase combat strength.*[* can be inferred as CPI]Whether it was a perfect-level fist technique, a Stellar Power Generation, Natural Breathing Technique, or a push from spirit power.They all relied on special force exertion techniques, or additional pushing force to stimulate the collision between muscles, thereby achieving the effect of explosion with more destructive driving force.In all this, his basic vitality would not change.But the Divine Illumination Meditation Scripture directly subverted this rule, increasing vitality right from the start.The subsequent introduction was even more exaggerated, saying that it could increase all attribute abilities, including the effect of spiritual power itself.This was simply ridiculous!Vitality was the foundation of everything, even amateurs who had just come into contact with martial arts knew this. The growth of vitality could only be achieved through hard work, nourishment, and gradual sharpening.There were indeed some methods that could temporarily increase vitality. But that was only by suddenly stimulating one\u2019s potential, thus temporarily increasing vitality.It was completely different from what Divine Illumination Meditation Scripture described.\u201cNo wonder the scripture was not divided into beginner and advanced levels. It was given to me directly, and I could search it with Level 3 authorization. Because constructing a perfect clone using spiritual power was undoubtedly an enormous project. It\u2019s too cumbersome and too difficult. It requires too much time and energy, and at the same time, it required a sufficient understanding of one\u2019s own body structure.\u201cIf one does not start constructing it at the early stages of martial arts, it would be impossible to complete it in the later stages, even if it was just taking the first step!\u201dLu Sheng took a deep breath, trying to calm the surging emotions in his heart.He was greatly shocked.\u201cI still underestimated the crystallization of ten thousand years of martial arts wisdom. This kind of cultivation method, let alone creating it now, even thinking about it is impossible \u2026\u201dLu Sheng firmly remembered the name \u201cDuan Yifeng\u201d in his heart.A person who could create Crystal Contemplation Method and the Divine Illumination Meditation Scripture at the same time was worthy of his heartfelt admiration.\u201cSuch a person is hard to come by once in a civilization. \u00a0I\u2019m afraid that even among Level 11 powerhouses, this Duan Yifeng should be considered an absolute top existence \u2026\u201dHe was already a Level 11 powerhouse, and with the all-around enhancement of Divine Illumination Meditation Scripture, how much more formidable was he? But even such a figure couldn\u2019t support the collapsing human civilization \u2026Lu Sheng was silent.\u201cAs it turns out, I was right. The ultimate goal of martial arts cultivation is ultimately to oneself. Even Level 11 Spiritual Master powerhouses to walk the path of using spirit power need to strengthen themselves in the end.\u201cNow that I look back, Crystal Contemplation Method does have a bit of intention of building the foundation for Divine Illumination Meditation Scripture. Crystal Contemplation Method also requires the construction of a crystal humanoid.\u201cOn the other hand, if I have some achievements in Divine Illumination Meditation Scripture, cultivating Crystal Contemplation Method will be easier and more effortless.\u201dLu Sheng did not continue to delay. He turned off Photon Mind and directly began to cultivate in the dream space. There were many things he needed to do, and he still had a long way to go.He could not afford to waste a single second.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 \u2013 What Is That Lu Sheng Doing?In the following time, Lu Sheng wholeheartedly devoted himself to the training in the advanced scripture. He didn\u2019t care about anything else.What training camp, what survival game, what assessment, what special training room \u2026 What could be more exciting than the crystallization of the wisdom of a martial artist who had been training for ten thousand years?Nothing.Apart from the three meals a day, Lu Sheng almost never left his room. All his time and energy were devoted to the training of the three, no, the four supreme techniques.Fortunately, he had enough points. If it was just food and accommodation, it was enough for him to stay until the end of the training.And Lu Sheng\u2019s strength also advanced by leaps and bounds in this training, sometimes even forgetting to eat and sleep.\u2026In the huge training ground, there were various training equipment scattered on the ground, as well as residual sweat, blood, and black footprints \u2026 Yang Yuan held a mop in both hands and was working hard to clean the stains on the ground.\u201cYang Yuan, you still haven\u2019t finished? Let me help you.\u201d A girl walked in and saw Yang Yuan mopping the floor. She naturally picked up a mop and ran over to help.\u201cThank you \u2026\u201d Yang Yuan stopped and wiped the sweat on her forehead. She showed a grateful smile to the girl.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Didn\u2019t you help me earlier? Hurry up and finish up, otherwise I\u2019ll have to stay up all night again \u2026\u201d The girl sighed and buried her head in the mop.Although her movements weren\u2019t standard, she was quite skilled. Yang Yuan nodded with a complicated expression.It had been almost a month since she entered the training camp. During this time, it could be said that she had a difficult time.Eating, drinking, sleeping, and living in the training camp all required points. Wanting to experience a better training environment also required points.Everything required points.Where did the points come from?Wasn\u2019t it from doing odd jobs, running errands, and being a cleaner?In order to enter the training room, or to ask the instructor for advice, sometimes she had to tighten her belt and starve for one or two meals. And the little bit of arrogance that belonged to a genius had long been worn away.The current Yang Yuan was just a \u201cpitiful worm\u201d who hoped to \u201csurvive\u201d in the training camp.Every day she could stay was a day more in here.Every day she stayed would be of great help to her future martial arts.Yang Yuan secretly thought in her heart.During this period of time, most of the trainees in the training camp had a hard time just like her. Everyone clenched their teeth and persevered, and those who couldn\u2019t persevere left early.Compared to these students who lived at the \u201cbottom\u201d, those with outstanding talents were even more dazzling.\u201cHave you heard? That Cao Yong from Yanglin City has already started to challenge the 4x gravity room \u2026\u201dThe girl who was helping mopped the floor to her side and raised her head to chat with her.\u201cFour times?\u201dYang Yuan was shocked. \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cHow could it be fake? Those guys in Yanglin City were so proud of themselves that they bragged to everyone they met that Cao Yong was about to become a Level 3 Martial Artist. After that, he would be able to challenge the higher gravity room. Who knew, he might even be able to set a new record in the training camp. You didn\u2019t see the faces of those people!\u201dThe girl was full of disdain and contempt, but her eyes couldn\u2019t hide the sourness she felt.Yang Yuan was shocked.Four times the gravity.She remembered that she had only stayed in the 2x gravity room for about 20 minutes before she almost passed out. She had no choice but to come out early.Her heart ached for the points she had wasted.Four times the gravity, wouldn\u2019t she be crushed to death if she went in?!\u201cWhat a freak!\u201d Yang Yuan sighed, shook her head, and continued mopping the floor. The girl who was helping her was full of energy and continued to tell her all the rumors she had heard.\u201c\u2026 Donggang City\u2019s Meng Jinhe is also a monster. It is said that he has already completed 70% of the second stage of the agility training room. The highest record in the training camp is only about 20% in the third stage.\u201cAnd that Xia Lin, although her results in the training room aren\u2019t outstanding, I heard that Cao Yong and Meng Jinhe had privately sparred with her before. Guess what the result was? They both lost miserably! Do you think all spiritual masters are really that freakish?\u201dThe girl chattered on, and the process contained all kinds of exaggerated tones and sighs. Yang Yuan silently mopped the floor, not saying a word.Suddenly, the girl\u2019s words made her body tremble slightly.\u201cYang Yuan, what do you think Lu Sheng has been doing all this time? Hiding in the room all day and not coming out. Is he learning from the ancient martial arts masters in the novels? Don\u2019t you have a good relationship with him? Do you know anything?\u201dYang Yuan\u2019s hands paused for a moment, then quickly returned to normal.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dThe girl sighed, and said, \u201cI guess you don\u2019t know either. This Lu Sheng, I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. When he first came in, he was so fierce that the whole camp couldn\u2019t say anything to him. In the end, he withered the next day \u2026\u201dThe girl picked up the mop in her hand and soaked it in the bucket. She shook her head and said, \u201cNow that more than a month has passed, everyone\u2019s strength, including those of us who didn\u2019t mix well, has advanced by leaps and bounds. There are quite a few who have broken through to become Level 2 Martial Artists. If Lu Sheng doesn\u2019t come out soon, someone will probably catch up to him \u2026\u201cYang Yuan, do you think he\u2019s scared? If he knew there would be such an outcome, he might as well hide like a turtle and increase the sense of mystery?\u201d The girl stared fixedly at Yang Yuan and asked.Yang Yuan couldn\u2019t help but think of that youth\u2019s figure.When he was still, he was like ice, silent, calm, low-key.When he erupted, he was like a volcano, wanton, insolent, like a demon king who controlled everything.\u201cNo, Lu Sheng isn\u2019t that kind of person.\u201d Yang Yuan said in a firm tone.\u201cThen he should hurry up and come out. Even if he doesn\u2019t support us, he should give us some face \u2026\u201dThe girl held the mop with a crazed expression, \u201cIt\u2019s not like you don\u2019t know how difficult it is now. Many of the people in the city have experts backing them, and all the easy and rewarding jobs have been snatched up. All that\u2019s left for us is some dirty and tiring jobs that earn us very few points. Those guys are specifically targeting us Baihe City people, can\u2019t you see?\u201cIt\u2019s all because Lu Sheng was too arrogant when he entered the camp. Since he wants to hide like a turtle now, he shouldn\u2019t have attracted so much hatred. Isn\u2019t this just digging a hole for us? Fuck!\u201dThe girl picked up the mop and heavily poked the bucket, causing water to splash everywhere.Yang Yuan forced a smile and comforted, \u201cYou go take rest, I\u2019ll clean up here.\u201dAfter saying that, she quietly cleaned up and didn\u2019t say anything else.In a room where the six walls were as black as lead, a strong body sat cross-legged quietly. It was an eighteen or nineteen year old youth.His skin was dark, and his appearance was ordinary. There was a trace of determination and fierceness between his brows.The youth sat in the middle of the room, motionless, but as if he was enduring an incomparably strong pressure, all the muscles in his body trembled slightly.Sweat condensed into a small stream, slowly flowing down from his muscles. His lower body was already wet.After an unknown amount of time, the youth\u2019s face began to become serious and strained. He struggled to lift half a finger, moving it bit by bit, and lightly pressed on a white remote control made of unknown material.Beep~Following the beeping sound, the air in the room seemed to lighten. The youth exhaled deeply and slowly stood up from the ground, his whole body emitting a series of bone cracking sounds.The youth walked out of the room, and a boy who had been waiting at the door immediately handed him a dry white towel.The youth casually took it, and while wiping the sweat on his body, he casually asked, \u201cHow long did I last this time?\u201d\u201cThree minutes and fifty-two seconds!\u201dThe boy quickly reported a number, his face revealing an excited and worshipful expression.\u201cCao Yong, you\u2019re really too strong. I thought you couldn\u2019t hold on any longer and I almost pressed the stop button outside, but you lasted another thirty seconds!\u201dThere was a large one-way glass outside the gravity training room, so those standing outside could clearly see what was going on inside. This prevented the people in the room from being unable to stop training due to excessive gravity, resulting in a tragedy.\u201cOnly a little more than a minute longer than last time?\u201d Cao Yong frowned, then turned to the boy and said, \u201cNext time I go in, I won\u2019t press the stop button myself. I\u2019ll leave when I only have enough strength to move my little finger, and when you see me move, immediately hit stop.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThe boy\u2019s face was full of admiration. \u201cCao Yong, you\u2019re going to put your life on the line. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to fully adapt to four times the gravity and break through to become a Level 3 Martial Artist. When that time comes, no one in the entire training camp will be a match for you \u2026\u201d\u201cLevel 3 Martial Artist?\u201d Cao Yong muttered, not boasting. Coming back to his senses, Cao Yong asked the boy next to him, \u201cDo you know what Xia Ling has been doing recently?\u201dThe boy thought for a moment, then said, \u201cCharlene rarely appears in the major training rooms. She has private tutoring from Chief Instructor Dong Qingxue, and she\u2019s also a spiritual master, so her special training methods are completely different from ordinary people \u2026\u201d\u201cSpiritual master!\u201dCao Yong\u2019s eyes abruptly shot out a strong light. \u201cSo what if she\u2019s a spiritual master? As long as my defence is strong enough, spiritual masters are just a joke. Xia Lin has private tutoring from Chief Instructor Dong Qingxue, so what?\u2026\u00a0hmph-hmph-hmph\u00a0\u2026\u201dCao Yong\u2019s eyes were filled with hostility, confidence, and arrogance.Many people didn\u2019t know that the reason Cao Yong had improved so quickly was not only because of his outstanding talent, but also because he had a mysterious and powerful \u201conline teacher\u201d!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 \u2013 Exit, Scent of the WindCao Yong didn\u2019t know much about the teacher, but he could feel that the teacher was very powerful. At the very least, he wasn\u2019t inferior to the training camp\u2019s Chief Instructor Dong Qingxue.More importantly, Cao Yong\u2019s teacher was also a defense-type martial artist, just like him. The two of them were practically from the same lineage.During this period, Cao Yong had been receiving pointers from the teacher every night. His strength had improved by leaps and bounds, and he couldn\u2019t believe it himself.\u201cThe reason why I lost to Xia Lin last time was because I\u2019ve never fought a spiritual master before, so I didn\u2019t know how they fought. If it\u2019s now, I might be able to beat her.\u201d Cao Yong was full of confidence.His teacher had once said that people like them should have complete faith in their own defence and be fearless. Only then would they be able to unleash their full strength.\u201cWhat about Meng Jinhe? How\u2019s he doing?\u201d Cao Yong asked again.The boy quickly replied, \u201cMeng Jinhe\u2019s training in the agility training room has reached 70% of the second stage. In terms of martial arts strength, he should be far from Level 3.\u201d\u201cMeng Jinhe is a problem \u2026\u201d Cao Yong frowned.Agility-type martial artists were the most troublesome. He hadn\u2019t thought of a good way to deal with Meng Jinhe, but he would ask his teacher later. His teacher would definitely have a way.Then, Cao Yong asked a few people in the training camp who were quite strong and had awakened their talents.The boy answered one by one.Finally, the boy hesitated and said, \u201cCao Yong, Lu Sheng from Baihe City is still the same. He doesn\u2019t go out except for eating every day, and he doesn\u2019t train \u2026\u201d\u201cLu Sheng?\u201dCao Yong was stunned for a moment, then quickly shook his head and said, \u201cI almost would\u2019ve forgotten that name if you hadn\u2019t mentioned it. Lu Sheng is of no concern, he\u2019s already crippled.\u201dWhat could a person who cooped up in his room for more than a month be capable of? Treating him as an opponent would be the greatest insult to oneself.\u2026\u201cCurrent Result: Second Stage, 81% Completion.\u201dAlong with the pleasant notification, there was a burst of enthusiastic exclamations outside the agility technique room.\u201cFuck, Jinhe is too strong. He improved by 11% from last time!\u201d\u201c81% of the second stage, I didn\u2019t even reach 81% of the first stage.\u201d\u201cYou think you can compare yourself to Jinhe?\u201dThe handsome and slender Meng Jinhe smiled as he walked out of the Agility Training Room. What greeted him were gazes of worship, admiration, and amazement.He enjoyed being surrounded.\u201cJin He, you should be able to enter the third stage soon, right?\u201dMeng Jinhe pretended to think for a moment, then nodded. \u201cIt should be soon.\u201d\u201cAs long as I enter the third stage, I won\u2019t be far from the record of the agility training room.\u201d\u201cJin He is trying to set a new record in the training camp!\u201d A boy said excitedly.\u201cAwesome!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s my idol!\u201dMeng Jin He was all smiles, his face filled with pride and confidence.Break a record?Wasn\u2019t this an easy task?Looking at the group of worshipping supporters in front of him, Meng Jinhe was secretly pleased. These people definitely didn\u2019t know that he had long been taken a liking by the Deputy Chief Instructor, Major Qin Shaojun.He had been secretly cultivating himself. If the chief didn\u2019t recognize his talent and ability, why would he focus on nurturing him?Wasn\u2019t this the greatest recognition for him? If he were to reveal this secret, the group of people in front of him would probably be shocked to death. It was better not to say it.Just like the Deputy Chief Instructor said, it was better for a man to keep a low profile. Meng Jinhe thought proudly.\u2026Xia Lin sat in a small, dark, sealed room.The sound of something flying through the air was constantly heard in the room, followed by the sound of something falling to the ground.When the light in the room was turned on, Xia Lin opened her eyes. She could see three cones the size of ping-pong balls floating around her like planets.Beneath her feet, tennis balls with holes in the middle were strewn all over the ground.Xia Lin\u2019s face was slightly pale, and her forehead was covered in a thin layer of sweat.The door opened, and Dong Qingxue walked in.\u201cNot bad. You\u2019re improving very quickly. You can already control three star cones. When you can control six, it means that you\u2019ve officially entered the level of a Level One Spiritual Master \u2026\u201d\u201cThank you, Chief Instructor. It\u2019s all because of your good guidance.\u201dXia Lin saw Dong Qingxue and quickly stood up to greet her.Dong Qingxue looked at Charlene with a hint of approval in her eyes. She nodded and said, \u201cIt has to do with your talent and hard work.\u201dAfter praising Xia Lin a few more times, Dong Qingxue suddenly frowned and said, \u201cHowever, I noticed something. There seems to be a huge flaw in your spiritual will. What\u2019s going on? Has someone left you with any psychological trauma?\u201dXia Lin was shocked. A handsome, cold, and terrifying side profile subconsciously appeared in her mind. She gritted her teeth and admitted, \u201cYes, Chief Instructor.\u201d\u201cA spiritual master\u2019s biggest taboo is a flaw in one\u2019s spiritual will. You have to take this seriously.\u201d Dong Qingxue said solemnly.\u201cInstructor, is there any way to fix this flaw?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s simple.\u201dDong Qingxue said calmly, \u201cFind the person who left the flaw, then defeat or kill them. The flaw will naturally disappear.\u201dDefeat or kill?!Xia Lin was shocked. She lowered her head and began to consider the possibility of achieving these two goals.Dong Qingxue saw her hesitation and could not help but say, \u201cYou\u2019re now in a period of rapid growth. It\u2019s actually not difficult to achieve this.\u201dNot difficult?Xia Lin bit her lip. Conflict and fear flashed across her face. She heard that that terrifying person had been in a decadent state all this time.If his strength remained at the same level, she might really be able to defeat him.Perhaps \u2026\u201cHow is it?\u201dDong Qingxue walked out of the room, leaving Xia Lin alone to think about the training. She bumped into Qin Shaojun, who was waiting at the door.\u201cHer talent is good, but her character still needs to be sharpened. She\u2019s too weak \u2026\u201d Dong Qingxue gave a fair evaluation.\u201cShe\u2019s soft on the outside but tough on the inside. She can be taught slowly.\u201dQin Shaojun comforted her. Then, he said, \u201cIs it too late for me to regret my decision?\u201dDong Qingxue asked in confusion, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is Meng Jinhe\u2019s talent not good enough?\u201dQin Shaojun smiled bitterly and said, \u201cHis talent is alright, but his character \u2026 Sigh, let\u2019s not talk about it.\u201dDong Qingxue said calmly, \u201cSince you\u2019ve already taught him, you might as well teach him until the end. It\u2019s only a month or two anyway. It\u2019ll be over if you grit your teeth \u2026\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Qin Shaojun was helpless.\u201cOh, right.\u201dDong Qingxue suddenly thought of something. She looked at Qin Shaojun and said, \u201cLu Sheng \u2026 is he still the same?\u201dQin Shaojun was stunned when he heard Dong Qingxue mention this name. He then nodded.\u201cHe\u2019s still the same. He only goes out three times a day. Other than that, he stays in the dormitory. No one knows what he\u2019s doing in there.\u201d\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have told him that in the first place!\u201d Dong Qingxue suddenly said resentfully.She had told everyone during the assembly that she and Qin Shaojun would not interfere with anyone\u2019s cultivation methods. As long as they saw it fit, they could sleep in the dormitory every day and no one would care.Who would have thought that someone would really sleep in the dormitory every day!Most importantly, this person had performed the best in the entrance exam. She had rewarded him with a total of 1,000 points, ten times more than the other three! This amount of points was enough for him to sleep until the end of the training camp.\u201cHe was such a good seedling. How did he end up like this \u2026\u201d Dong Qingxue shook her head and sighed regretfully.Qin Shaojun could not help but ask, \u201cAre you still using him as a whetstone?\u201d\u201cWhetstone my ass!\u201dDong Qingxue walked out without looking back. \u201cLet him be. Teach Meng Jinhe well. Otherwise, Xia Lin will beat him up badly during the closed-door exam.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s afraid of who!\u201d Qin Shaojun shouted indignantly.Then, he seemed to have thought of something and sighed softly.Just as a certain person\u2019s name, glory, and oppression \u2026 gradually faded from everyone\u2019s sight, the door of a single dormitory in the training camp finally opened at a different time \u2026It opened quietly.Sunlight shone through the branches of the tree in front of the dormitory and scattered on Lu Sheng\u2019s face.Lu Sheng narrowed his eyes and stared at a pair of flower-tailed sparrows on a tree branch for a long time.Lu Sheng only looked away when they flew away.\u201cIt\u2019s been a month \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng sighed softly.Compared to a month ago, Lu Sheng\u2019s figure was now more well-proportioned and upright. He had grown taller and his hair had grown longer. His skin was fairer and more delicate than a month ago, and his eyes were clearer and brighter.His entire temperament seemed to have undergone some indescribable changes, but no one could pinpoint exactly where. In the past month, Lu Sheng had been completely immersed in cultivation.Advanced Stellar Body Refinement Techinque, Advanced Natural Breathing Technique, Advanced Crystal Contemplation Method, and Advanced Divine Illumination Meditation Scripture!He cultivated all four techniques at the same time until he finished all the Marrow Nourishing Pills in his hand. His cultivation progress slowed down slightly.Only then did he stop.How much stronger had Lu Sheng become in the past month?No one knew.Even Lu Sheng himself did not know.\u201cNow, I just want to find a place where I can properly test the growth of my strength \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng looked at his hands and muttered to himself.Soon, he found it.Lu Sheng lifted his feet and walked toward a certain location marked on the map of the base in his memory.He was very fast and disappeared in the blink of an eye.Not only that, his breathing \u2026 It seemed to carry the scent of the wind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 \u2013 Breaking Air in the Gravity RoomProdigy Training Camp, Special Training Room.The hall was very big, almost as big as a football field.There were a total of eight entrances to the hall, and all kinds of special training rooms were located in different locations.At one of the entrances, three boys were talking as they walked out.\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve improved a lot. Next time, I\u2019ll consider going to 2x gravity room. When the time comes, help me keep an eye. I don\u2019t want to have to go to the infirmary with internal bleeding \u2026\u201d\u201cNo problem, but we agreed on a shared room. If you want to try 2x gravity, you\u2019ll have to pay the majority of the points.\u201d\u201cSure, I\u2019ll pay half \u2026\u201dFor the students at the bottom tier, it was too difficult to earn points. Every point was precious.However, the cost of using the Cultivation Room was too high. Therefore, sharing a training room with several people had become the most popular choice at the moment.Not only could it maximize the value of renting a training room, but they could also take care of each other during training to avoid accidents.While they were chatting, the three of them saw a figure walking towards them.The person was only walking, but he was quite fast. In the blink of an eye, the three of them lost sight of the person.They felt as if a gust of wind blew past their faces.When they came back to their senses, they found that their bodies had somehow moved to the side, leaving a space for a person to pass through.\u201cHow come there\u2019s such a strong when he passed by?\u201d One of the boys muttered curiously.\u201cWho cares about the wind. Let\u2019s go. We still have work to do.\u201d His companion said.The boy nodded. Just as he was about to continue walking, he suddenly noticed that one of the three was staring at the back of the person who had just walked past them.\u201cWhat? Did you see a beauty?\u201d The boy waved his hand in front of his companion\u2019s eyes.His companion\u2019s eyes lit up as if he had caught on to something very big. \u201cDid you guys notice the person who just walked past?\u201d\u201cWho?\u201dThe two of them followed their companion\u2019s gaze and only saw that the person had already walked far away.\u201cSo fast!\u201d The two of them stared.In such a short time, he was already gone. And he was just walking.\u201cLu Sheng, that guy is Baihe City\u2019s Lu Sheng!\u201d His companion shouted excitedly.\u201cThis guy hasn\u2019t left his room since the day after he entered the camp. Apart from the mess hall, he hasn\u2019t been anywhere else. He actually came to the training room today, this is a huge news!\u201d The other two\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cIs it really him?\u201d\u201cHow could it be fake? He just walked past us.\u201d\u201cQuick! Let\u2019s follow him!\u201d The three of them did not intend to leave. Driven by their curiosity, they quickly chased after him.\u2026\u201cIs this the so-called Gravity Training Room?\u201d Lu Sheng sized up the small room in front of him. There was a huge one-way glass on the wall outside the room, allowing one to clearly see the scene inside the room.It was empty inside, and the walls were pure black.There were a total of six such Gravity Training Rooms. Most of them were empty. Only one or two rooms had people standing outside, and their attention was focused on the glass panels in front of them.\u201cLet\u2019s go in and have a look.\u201d Lu Sheng took out his ID card and swiped it on the card machine outside the training room.The card machine showed the number 365.Lu Sheng had a total of 1,000 points. After staying in the room for so long, he still had a lot left.\u201c10 points per hour \u2026\u201dLu Sheng thought for a bit and decided: \u201cThen let\u2019s start with 3 hours.\u201dAfter all, there was still some time before supper.The card machine deducted the points, and the total remaining points became 335.Then the door of the training room made a \u201cbeep\u201d sound, and the door automatically opened.Lu Sheng walked in. There was a small empty space in front of the door. Next to it was a dense list of things to take note of.\u201cYou have to take off your shoes, and you can\u2019t bring anything with you \u2026\u201dLu Sheng followed the instructions and took out everything from his pocket, put it on the designated shelf, and then walked barefoot into the room.The floor of the room was made of some unknown material, and it was abnormally soft.To describe it in a popular phrase, it was like \u201cstepping on shit\u201d. When a person walked on it, the floor would slightly sink in.Lu Sheng walked to the centre of the room. There was a white remote control on the floor.With just a glance, he knew that it was used to adjust the gravity.\u201cLet\u2019s start with 2x gravity first \u2026\u201dHe did not take a deep breath, nor did he prepare anything. Lu Sheng just casually pressed the start button on the remote control in his hand.\u2026\u201cHoly shit, this guy doesn\u2019t even need to warm up?\u201dOutside the gravity room, the three boys couldn\u2019t help but blurt out when they saw Lu Sheng reach out to press the start button.\u201cThis guy has been out of the rhythm of the training camp for too long. He doesn\u2019t even have basic common sense \u2026\u201dOne of the boys shook his head and said, \u201cThe Gravity Training Room is no joke. We\u2019re all official martial artists. Our muscles and bones may be fine, and they can withstand sudden changes in external pressure. But the fragile internal organs won\u2019t have it easy. If we don\u2019t warm up and prepare accordingly, it\u2019s easy to cause internal bleeding. Did you forget the first time we went in?\u201d\u201cWho told him to be so arrogant in the past? It\u2019s good to suffer a little and learn a lesson!\u201d Another boy said gloatingly.The other two nodded in tacit understanding.Beep~The sound indicated the activation of the gravity mechanism. The three boys smiled and stared at Lu Sheng in the room, ready to watch a good show.The glass outside the training room was a one-way glass anyway, so they didn\u2019t have to worry about being discovered by Lu Sheng.\u201cWhy isn\u2019t there any reaction?\u201d\u201cIs it because he hasn\u2019t activated it yet?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s activated.\u201dOne of the boys glanced to the side. There was a small screen outside each room, showing the value of the gravity in the room.Now the screen showed that 2x gravity had been activated.\u201cThen why isn\u2019t there any reaction at all?\u201dOne of the boys couldn\u2019t believe it and moved closer, widening his eyes to get a clearer view.In the room, Lu Sheng\u2019s face was calm, as if nothing had happened to him.\u201cEven his expression hasn\u2019t changed!\u201d\u201cCould it be \u2026\u201d Just as the other boy was about to voice his conjecture, he saw Lu Sheng suddenly raise his hand and throw out a punch.The fist was so fast that it was impossible to see it clearly.Pop!The three of them were stunned and looked at each other.\u201cWas that \u2026 the sound of a fist breaking through air?\u201dThe three of them were stunned.The Gravity Training Room was soundproof, so the sound from inside would be weakened and distorted when it reached the outside. So the sound of a fist breaking through air was only the faint sound of a bubble popping in their ears.\u201cHoly shit!\u201dOne of the boys couldn\u2019t help but yell. \u201cIs that for real?! I can\u2019t even move a little in 2x gravity, and this guy can make sounds with a punch?!\u201dAnyone with a bit of martial arts common sense would know. If you want to make the sound of air breaking with your fist, your fist must be fast enough.The other two couldn\u2019t believe it either.At that moment, they watched as Lu Sheng put down his fist, picked up the remote control, and pressed it.Beep~The Gravity Training Room\u2019s gravity changed.The three of them immediately looked at the screen outside the room.A clear line of words appeared on the screen: 4x Gravity activated.The three of them slowly opened their eyes and mouths at the same time.Like triplets, their expressions and movements were synchronized as they turned to look at the scene in the Gravity Training Room.This time, Lu Sheng, who was in the room, finally showed some reaction.\u2026The relaxed and casual look on Lu Sheng\u2019s face disappeared, and his expression seemed to be more serious.He moved his body, got up from the floor, and slowly began to move his arms and legs.\u201cFo \u2026 Fo \u2026\u201d One of the boys said with a shocked expression. Two exclamation marks came out of his mouth.\u201c4x gravity! He can still move under 4x gravity? Hurry up and pinch me, see if I\u2019m dreaming!\u201dHis two companions weren\u2019t much better than him. They looked like they had seen a ghost, and their expressions were dazed.The three of them just stood there and watched Lu Sheng in the room continue to move, and the speed of his movements was getting faster and faster, and the frequency was getting higher and higher \u2026\u201cHe\u2019s improved today. He lasted more than 20 seconds under 2x gravity \u2026\u201dThe door to the Gravity Training Room adjacent to them opened, and a pale girl covered in sweat walked out.Her companion, who had been waiting at the door, quickly went up to support her and praised her with a smile. The girl\u2019s pale face squeezed out a smile, she was obviously very happy.The two of them talked for a while, and suddenly noticed something strange next to them.\u201cLook at these three guys, their expressions are so funny!\u201d\u201cWhat are they looking at? Let\u2019s go take a look.\u201dThe two girls curiously walked over and glanced at the data on the screen outside the door.\u201c4x gravity?!\u201dThe expressions of the two girls suddenly changed. Instead of walking, they started to jog and quickly moved towards the glass window.\u201cIs Cao Yong in there? He seems to be the only one in the entire training camp who can enter the 4x gravity room!\u201dSoon, a figure that was constantly kicking and punching came into view.The two girls were instantly stunned, as if they had been petrified.Their expressions gradually became the same as those of the three boys from before.\u201cHoly \u2026 shit \u2026\u201dThe five of them stood in front of the glass for a while, and after who knows how long, someone suddenly came back to his senses and reacted.\u201cI\u2019ll go get someone! This is too fucking exaggerated \u2026\u201d As soon as he turned around, he disappeared without a trace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 \u2014 Breath of Earth! Lu Sheng is back!Peng!Peng!Pa!On the training ground, several boys with baseball bats surrounded Cao Yong and attacked him continuously.The hard baseball bats smashed into Cao Yong\u2019s body, but they made a muffled sound as if they were hitting a rock.Cao Yong\u2019s skin was a strange gray colour. When the wooden bats hit his skin, they were immediately bounced off.\u201cAgain!\u201dCao Yong\u2019s face was full of anger. He could only passively take the hits and couldn\u2019t fight back. There was a fire in his chest that could explode at any time.\u201cCao Yong, take a break. Our hands are almost numb \u2026\u201d A boy with a baseball bat said with a bitter smile.Cao Yong paused for a moment and nodded. \u201cOkay, then we\u2019ll practice later.\u201dAlthough these people were in awe of his talent and strength and were willing to gather around him, they were still martial arts geniuses. A top figure in the city could not really be his henchmen and be wantonly ordered around by him.He had to take care of their emotions.Seeing Cao Yong nod, the boys let out a sigh of relief and sat down to rest.Just as they were chatting idly, a person rushed in from outside as if his life depended on it.\u201cCao \u2026 Cao Yong, something \u2026 something big happened!\u201d The person was out of breath. To be able to make an official martial artist run like this, it must be something very urgent.\u201cSomething big? What can happen in the training camp?\u201d Cao Yong replied indifferently. Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something. He stood up abruptly and said, \u201cMeng Jinhe broke the record? Or Xia Lin?\u201dThe person patted his chest and calmed his breathing. He shook his head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not Meng Jinhe or Xia Lin \u2026\u201d\u201cThen who is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Lu Sheng! That Lu Sheng from Baihe City!\u201dThe person finally calmed his breathing and finished speaking in one breath. \u201cLu Sheng entered the 4x Gravity Training Room. He \u2026 Ai, I don\u2019t know. Anyway, he\u2019s about to break your record. Let\u2019s go have a look!\u201d\u201cLu Sheng?!\u201d Cao Yong\u2019s expression froze. This was a name he never thought of. \u201cLet\u2019s go take a look.\u201dCao Yong thought for a moment, grabbed his clothes on the ground and strode out of the training room.\u2026\u201cI\u2019ve almost become familiar with 4x gravity \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng stopped what he was doing, his face calm. The Gravity Training Room was more interesting than he had imagined.In other words, it was very suitable for his current state. After a month of hard work, Lu Sheng, who had improved in all aspects, needed an environment like this that could constantly provide him with pressure to settle down.\u201c2x gravity doesn\u2019t affect me at all. I just feel a little more burden on my body. It\u2019s like the air has become thicker, and it takes more effort to do the same action as usual. With four times the gravity, this feeling becomes even more pronounced. In the beginning, even breathing was a little difficult. But it\u2019s just discomfort. When you get used to it, it\u2019s all the same.\u201dAs Lu Sheng thought about it, he picked up the remote control on the ground and pressed the \u201c+\u201d button.The gravity increased again!Five times the gravity!Lu Sheng felt a sudden pressure on him.Lu Sheng felt his body sink down, as if he had suddenly fallen into a swamp, and his movements became increasingly difficult.\u201cThis pressure should be sufficient \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes lit up and he took a deep breath. \u201cNow, it\u2019s time to test out my new gains.\u201d\u201cSwitch to Earth Breathing!\u201d In an instant, Lu Sheng\u2019s breathing changed.It was a change that couldn\u2019t be described in detail. Lu Sheng\u2019s chest began to move up and down in a strange rhythm, and his body began to move in a strange way. His feet were tightly gripping the ground.Through the thick floor mats, it was as if there was an invisible force flowing through the ground and into his body.This was one of Lu Sheng\u2019s gains from this month of hard work.One of the special breathing techniques he had learned from the advanced chapter of Natural Breathing Technique.Earth Breathing Technique!Although Lu Sheng was still far from being able to comprehend the corresponding Earth inner energy (inner strength), what he was able to grasp now was enough to bring about a significant boost to his strength.Like now.Hiss~Outside the training room, the crowd of onlookers all sucked in a breath of cold air when they saw this. At this time, the small room was already crowded with people. At the same time, there were people rushing in from the eight entrances of the training room.Among them was Cao Yong who had just arrived.\u201cHow is it? Has Lu Sheng come out? How long has he been in the 4x gravity room?\u201d Cao Yong asked as soon as he arrived.Before the person he asked could answer, he heard the crowd at the glass window erupt into fierce exclamations.\u201cHoly shit, 5x gravity!\u201d\u201cLu Sheng increased the gravity to five times!\u201d\u201cOh my god, if I went in, I would probably be crushed to death!\u201d\u201cCrazy!\u201dFive times gravity?!Cao Yong was stunned for a moment when he heard these discussions, then he quickly rushed over and pushed the crowd aside with a sullen face.\u201cMotherfucker, push your father \u2026\u201d A boy who was grabbed by the shoulder by Cao Yong turned his head angrily, only to see Cao Yong\u2019s scarily sullen face.He was stunned.\u201cCao Yong?\u201dCao Yong was here.The news quickly spread among the crowd.The people in front of the glass turned their heads and looked at Cao Yong with a strange look.\u201cThis is going to be a good show \u2026\u201d Someone whispered secretly.Cao Yong pretended that he didn\u2019t hear this and looked straight into the room.Inside the room, a tall young man was standing in the middle of the room, his body swaying slightly to a special rhythm. His breathing was steady, and his handsome face was calm.At first glance, Cao Yong\u2019s pupils shrank.He could still stand up?!Cao Yong turned his head and looked at the small screen next to him in disbelief.The crowd opened up a path for him. Someone joked, \u201cCao Yong, don\u2019t look, it\u2019s really five times, the screen isn\u2019t broken!\u201d\u201cHaha \u2026\u201d Soft laughter could be heard from the crowd \u2026Cao Yong glared at that person, then turned to look at the training room. He was shocked and in disbelief.Five times the gravity! It was really five times gravity.How did Lu Sheng do it under this kind of pressure?He, Cao Yong, had a mysterious and powerful martial artist teacher who taught him online every night. He had so many points that he couldn\u2019t spend them all. He soaked in the Gravity Training Room every day and gained ten times more than others. His vitality (BQV) had also improved by leaps and bounds \u2026With so many unique conditions, he only dared to try 4x gravity a week ago.It took him a week to achieve the result of three minutes in 4x gravity. Yet he couldn\u2019t move around like Lu Sheng. He couldn\u2019t move at all.Under 4x gravity, it was difficult for him to even blink, let alone stand and move around like Lu Sheng.How did he do it?!Didn\u2019t he just come out of seclusion in the dormitory today?!Cao Yong pressed his hands on the one-way glass window, staring into the room. His expression was ferocious and exaggerated, even a little funny.At this moment, no one could laugh.Everyone\u2019s attention was on Lu Sheng in the room. Their expressions were complicated and indescribable.\u201cLu Sheng is back \u2026\u201d Suddenly, someone in the crowd said softly.There were many people who heard this, and their expressions all fell silent.Yes.Lu Sheng was back.The Lu Sheng who shocked and oppressed everyone when he entered the camp, the Lu Sheng who was like a demon king \u2026Now, he was back.\u201cEarth Breathing can reduce about ten percent of the pressure under five times gravity \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng came up with a figure in his heart.It was already a very impressive effect. After all, among the few breathing techniques that he had comprehended, his achievements in the Earth Breathing Technique was the lowest.It was also not the direction that he focussed on.\u201cThe concept of \u201cNatural Breathing Technique\u201d is very obvious. It is the unity of man and nature, allowing the practitioner to unleash one hundred percent or even one hundred and twenty percent of their combat power in any environment \u2026\u201dThe power of a Level 11 technique could only be understood after one had truly practised and experienced it.That kind of level and structure was not something that ordinary techniques could compare to.\u201c5x gravity is almost suitable for my current cultivation under normal conditions. Under five times the gravity, I should be able to do the movements of the Stellar Body Refining Technique. If the gravity is increased any higher, it will be difficult \u2026\u201dHowever, Lu Sheng knew that this was under normal conditions. The Stellar Body Refining Technique could not be casually exposed to outsiders.Therefore \u2026 He had to seek pressure.More pressure.Pressure that could push him to his limits!In that case \u2026 He would continue to increase the gravity.With a calm expression, Lu Sheng picked up the remote control and gently pressed a button.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 \u2013 Eight Times the Gravity, Record Refreshed, Shocking!\u201cLu Sheng can\u2019t hold on any longer. He\u2019s about to turn off the gravity \u2026\u201d\u201cAfter all, it\u2019s 5x gravity. Being able to hold on for so long is already amazing. If it were me, I wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on for even a second!\u201dOutside the training room, everyone saw Lu Sheng holding the remote control through the window.Almost everyone subconsciously thought that Lu Sheng had reached his limit and was about to stop cultivating.\u201cIs anyone keeping time? How long has Lu Sheng stayed in the training room? Did he break the record?\u201dSomeone suddenly yelled.Everyone immediately reacted.Yes, a 5x gravity training. This was enough to break the record for the highest gravity training in the training camp.However, whether he had broken the record, he would only know after seeing it.\u201cIs there anyone keeping time?\u201d Some people followed suit and shouted.\u201cKeep time my ass. Isn\u2019t there a time record on the display? Just one look and you\u2019ll know.\u201d Someone replied speechlessly.\u201cYeah, why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201dImmediately, a group of people gathered in front of the display screen at the door.Cao Yong was also mixed in with the crowd. His expression was solemn, but his eyes were very anxious. Clearly, he was also very curious about this matter.A group of people squeezed in front of the small display screen, each of them desperately trying to move forward. The faces of the few people at the front were almost stuck to the display screen.\u201cHow much time does it show?\u201d the man behind him kept urging.How much time?\u201cTell me if once you\u2019ve seen it!\u201d\u201cMotherfucker, I can\u2019t see because of you guys!\u201d A boy with a thick neck roared.Only then did the people behind slowly retreat a little.The display screen was finally visible.The people at the front of the line tried their best to stare at the numbers on the display screen, for fear of missing a decimal point.\u201cUnder 5x gravity, the activation time is 7 minutes \u2026\u201dThe crowd burst into an uproar when they heard the words \u201c7 minutes\u201d.\u201cHoly shit, five times the gravity for more than seven minutes! Isn\u2019t this already a record?!\u201d\u201cLu Sheng, this is insane! What is this called? Doesn\u2019t the saying go, \u2018Silent but astounding, one roar amazes all!'\u201d\u201cDo you think he was in seclusion for the past month, practising some kind of peerless martial art?\u201d\u201cWith this result, could Lu Sheng already be a Level 3 Martial Artist?\u201d\u201cTsk tsk \u2026\u201dHearing the discussions about him, Cao Yong\u2019s heart was filled with mixed feelings. He suddenly felt that all his efforts over the past month had been in vain.The online guidance of a mysterious teacher, the time he spent in the Gravity Training Room ten times longer than others \u2026 It was all a joke.Three minutes under 4x gravity and seven minutes under 5x gravity were two completely different concepts, okay?The difference between them \u2026Cao Yong\u2019s pride was shattered at this moment. Standing in the crowd, he felt like a clown.\u201cSeven minutes and \u2026? You haven\u2019t completed your words.\u201d\u201cYeah, seven minutes and how many seconds? Hurry up and say it!\u201dThere was another commotion in the crowd.But at this time, the guy at the front of the line didn\u2019t say anything.His head was stuck straight in front of the display screen. His expression was blank, and he couldn\u2019t utter a word.\u201cFuck, you\u2019re occupying the stall but aren\u2019t taking a dump!\u201d A hot-tempered fatty couldn\u2019t stand it any longer and rushed forward to pull them apart.\u201cIt\u2019s just a few numbers. Is it that difficult?\u201d As he spoke, he looked up at the display screen.With this look, his entire body instantly froze on the spot, not uttering a single word.After being pulled apart by the fatty, the people blocking the front dispersed quite a bit. The crowd behind also took the opportunity to see the full picture of the display screen.In an instant, everyone fell silent.Their eyes were fixed on the small display screen. Their expressions were as if they had seen a ghost.\u201cFuck \u2026\u201d Someone choked out a word. He opened and closed his mouth, but no words came out.On the small display screen, a line of clear words was displayed.6x gravity activated.Six times the gravity!Lu Sheng did not leave the Gravity Training Room yet.He was holding the remote control, not to pause, but to \u2026 continue to increase the gravitational force!Cao Yong stood in the crowd and stared at the big six on the display screen. His expression was a little dazed.At this moment, under everyone\u2019s watchful eyes.The numbers on the display screen changed again.The original number of six quietly changed to seven.\u201cSeven times the gravity has been activated!\u201dIn an instant \u2026 The crowd completely exploded!\u2026\u201cToday, two more students couldn\u2019t hold on and applied to leave the camp \u2026\u201d Dong Qingxue casually threw the two documents aside and said with a cold expression.Qin Shaojun held his coffee and comforted her with a casual expression, \u201cThey\u2019re all spoiled by their families. They\u2019re geniuses who are the centre of attention in their cities. It\u2019s normal for them to not be able to withstand the pressure here. Don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry \u2026\u201d\u201cThey can\u2019t even withstand this little pressure? They can\u2019t even withstand this little difficulty? Then, when they go to the battlefield and fight against beasts with real swords and spears, can they withstand it?\u201dDong Qingxue sneered and said, \u201cGeniuses in the safe zone will never be considered geniuses. Only geniuses who have experienced the baptism of the battlefield can be considered true geniuses!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too serious.\u201dQin Shaojun shook his head and said, \u201cActually, the quality of this batch of students is not bad. I estimate that at least 80% of them can last until the day the camp closes.\u201d\u201cI hope so.\u201dDong Qingxue ended the topic and was about to continue reading the documents in her hand when suddenly, the computer in front of her rang with a crisp notification.Ding dong!A hint of surprise appeared on Dong Qingxue\u2019s face. She opened the message, and the first words that greeted her eyes made her happy.\u201cSomeone has broken the record of the Gravity Training Room!\u201d Dong Qing Xue said.Qin Shaojun, who had been sitting calmly at the side, immediately became interested.\u201cSo fast? Who is it? Cao Yong? This kid is not bad. Qi Meng taught him well. I should find time to treat him to a meal \u2026 \u201dDong Qingxue\u2019s expression became more and more strange as she read the message.Suddenly, she raised her head and looked at Qin Shaojun in a daze. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s not Cao Yong. It\u2019s someone you\u2019d never expect.\u201d\u201cSomeone I\u2019d never expect?\u201dQin Shaojun was a little puzzled. \u201cWho is it?\u201dDong Qingxue looked into Qin Shaojun\u2019s eyes and said word by word, \u201cIt\u2019s Lu Sheng!\u201d\u201cPfft!\u201dQin Shaojun spat out the coffee in his mouth and spilled it all over the floor.\u201cWho? Lu Sheng? That kid came out of seclusion? He\u2019s been in seclusion for more than a month, and he still managed to break the record?!\u201dQin Shaojun asked a series of questions, his face full of disbelief.Dong Qingxue nodded and thought for a while. \u201cIt seems that he didn\u2019t completely waste the past month. Coupled with his original strength, it\u2019s still possible for him to achieve this result.\u201dQin Shaojun held his cup and wiped his mouth as he said in a daze, \u201cThat\u2019s right. But this kid still gave us a big surprise. It seems that the Whetstone Project can continue \u2026\u201dDong Qingxue smiled slightly and said confidently, \u201cSince Lu Sheng is back, that\u2019s great. I was just worried that Xia Lin\u2019s strength was improving too quickly and that no one in the training camp could give her any pressure. Lu Sheng\u2019s current strength is just right. He can be Xia Lin\u2019s whetstone \u2026\u201dDong Qingxue paused for a moment and said in a serious tone, \u201cA whetstone for one person.\u201d\u201cLook at you.\u201d Qin Shaojun shook his head and walked to Dong Qingxue\u2019s side.\u201cLet me see Lu Sheng\u2019s record-breaking result. I remember that the highest record in the Gravity Training Room is 5x gravity. How many minutes is it \u2026\u201dAs Qin Shaojun spoke, he walked to Dong Qingxue\u2019s side. Dong Qing Xue let him have the computer.She was about to show Qin Shaojun the message records.Suddenly.Ding dong!There was a new message.\u201cAnother record-breaking news in the Gravity Training Room?!\u201d Qin Shaojun\u2019s face revealed a look of surprise as he opened the message.\u201cDamn, 6x the gravity! It\u2019s still Lu Sheng!\u201dDong Qingxue was also a little surprised.\u201cIt seems that Lu Sheng\u2019s improvement in the past month is beyond our imagination. This kid \u2026\u201dBefore Dong Qingxue could finish her sentence \u2026Ding dong!The third message arrived.It was still the Gravity Training Room. It was still the notification of a new record.It was still \u2026 It was Lu Sheng.\u201cSeven \u2026 Seven times the gravity!\u201dQin Shaojun was so shocked that he stuttered. He turned to look at Dong Qingxue. \u201cHow much strength did this kid hide? Is he a freaking monster?!\u201dDong Qingxue was also shocked. She did not know how to answer Qin Shaojun.\u201cI have to go to the Gravity Training Room to have a look!\u201d Qin Shaojun could not hold back and said quickly.Dong Qingxue\u2019s eyes flickered, and she stood up as well.\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go meet that kid together!\u201d The two of them were ready to leave as they spoke.At this moment \u2026Ding dong!A crisp and pleasant sound rang in the room.This sound seemed to have some kind of special magic, causing Qin Shaojun and Dong Qingxue to look at the computer screen.Qin Shaojun did not know what to feel. He slowly moved the mouse and clicked on the message.When he and Dong Qingxue saw the words 8x gravity and Lu Sheng\u2019s name in the message, both of their expressions froze.The room was dead silent.Then, Qin Shaojun let out a long sigh.\u201cThis kid Lu Sheng \u2026 What level is he at now?\u201dNo one answered him.Dong Qingxue could not either.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 \u2013 BQV Amplification. You Really Aren\u2019t Afraid of the Whetstone Breaking the Knife?Yang Yuan stood on her tiptoes, trying her best to wipe the stains on the glass.\u201cAfter doing this, I\u2019ll get 5 points. Adding the points I saved up before, it\u2019s enough for me to ask the instructor for advice once. The rest is enough for me to enter the Combat Training Room again \u2026\u201dYang Yuan used the back of her hand to wipe the fine beads of sweat on the tip of her nose, calculating in her mind.Logically speaking, with her strength as an official martial artist, her physical strength and endurance were several times that of a normal adult male\u2019s. This kind of work shouldn\u2019t be enough to make her sweat.But there was a lot to do.In just one morning, Yang Yuan had run to at least seven or eight places and had done no less than four or five different kinds of work.Every job was completed in less than 20 minutes.Under such a high-intensity workload, even with Yang Yuan\u2019s physique, her physical strength was almost depleted.\u201cThump thump thump \u2026\u201dA girl quickly ran in.Seeing the girl, Yang Yuan hurriedly said, \u201cYou came just in time. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on today, but there\u2019s a lot of work that no one wants. I\u2019ve already earned 40 or 50 points. Come and help me!\u201dThe girl ran in front of her and looked at her as if she was an alien.\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you for so long. I didn\u2019t expect you to be in the mood to clean the windows.\u201dYang Yuan squeezed the rag in her hand and asked curiously, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I clean the windows? Do you have a lot of points?\u201dThe girl stomped her foot heavily and said in a rather helpless tone, \u201cEveryone went to the Gravity Training Room. Why didn\u2019t you go?\u201dYang Yuan\u2019s heart thumped. \u201cToday\u2019s the group assessment? Why didn\u2019t I know? Why didn\u2019t anyone tell me?\u201d\u201cWhat assessment? It\u2019s Lu Sheng! Lu Sheng came out!\u201dThe girl\u2019s face lit up, and she shouted excitedly, \u201cAnd he broke the record for the Gravity Training Room as soon as he came out. Don\u2019t even mention how exaggerated it is. Right now, half of the training camp is watching \u2026\u201dThe girl kept chattering away.Halfway through her sentence, she suddenly realized that Yang Yuan\u2019s figure had disappeared in front of her. All that was left was a lonely bucket with a rag that hadn\u2019t been wrung dry hanging on the rim of the bucket.She turned around and saw a figure running out of the hall\u2019s entrance.\u201cDamn, that\u2019s fast! When did you learn to fly?\u201d The girl shouted exaggeratedly and hurriedly chased after her.\u2026\u201cSeven times the gravity!\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s body maintained a slightly bent posture, slowly resisting and adapting to the pressure on his body.He had already pushed the Earth Breathing Technique to its limits. Lu Sheng\u2019s understanding of the Earth Breathing Technique deepened as he continued to use it under high gravitational force.\u201cI\u2019m almost at my limit \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng thought to himself.After all, in an environment that multiplied the gravity, which wasn\u2019t a real battlefield. It tested a martial artist\u2019s vitality, physique, and willpower.Under this kind of pressure that was evenly applied to every part of the body, techniques such as Stellar Power were completely ineffective.\u201cThen let\u2019s try that technique \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng took a deep breath. His spiritual power flowed into his body like water and reached his heart.His spiritual power transformed into threads, and in just a few breaths, he weaved an invisible heart that was identical to his actual heart.Unfortunately, this uncanny scene couldn\u2019t be seen by outsiders. Otherwise, their jaws would definitely drop to the ground from shock.The skill and hard work involved in this was enough to make people gasp in amazement.This invisible heart, which represented almost all of Lu Sheng\u2019s non-stop efforts for more than a month, perfectly overlapped with Lu Sheng\u2019s original heart.BOOM!Both hearts beat at the same time.In an instant, a majestic force gushed out from Lu Sheng\u2019s heart.In an environment with seven times the gravity and absolute silence, Lu Sheng could almost hear the roar of his blood rushing through his veins.That was his skyrocketing vitality!As his vitality increased, the pressure from seven times the gravity also lessened.\u201cJust by building the heart, my vitality has increased by almost ten percent. The effects of the Divine Illumination Meditation Scripture are truly terrifying \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng slowly stretched his body that was bound by gravity.Vitality was the foundation of a martial artist. An increase in vitality would increase a martial artist\u2019s abilities in all aspects. It was not as simple as +1 in strength or +1 in agility and speed.An increase of almost ten percent in vitality was a huge improvement for Lu Sheng.Moreover, unlike Stellar Power, this increase did not have any requirements on the physique.Unlike ordinary increase in vitality, the Divine Illumination Meditation Scripture\u2019s increase had no side effects and lasted longer.Lu Sheng could feel his spiritual power slowly depleting. Before his spiritual power was completely depleted, this increase would continue.\u201cThen I\u2019ll just increase the pressure \u2026\u201dAfter Lu Sheng felt his vitality increase, the limit of what he could withstand increased again. He picked up the remote control and pressed the \u201c+\u201d button again.Eight times the gravity!BOOM!A powerful force pressed down on Lu Sheng\u2019s body.BOOM!Lu Sheng lost his balance and fell to one knee on the ground.In the end, he had underestimated the terrifying pressure of eight times the gravity.It felt as if ten thousand small road rollers were madly crushing every surface of his body. Lu Sheng could even hear the creaking sound of his muscles and bones pressing against each other.Even the Earth Breathing Technique was of little use under such terrifying pressure.\u201cI\u2019m almost at my limit \u2026\u201dAt this moment, Lu Sheng was glad that he was practising the Stellar Body Refinement Technique.This Level 11 Body Refining Technique not only tempered his external body, but also strengthened his internal organs at the same time.The strength of his internal organs was far beyond that of ordinary martial artists. Otherwise, Lu Sheng would have collapsed from internal bleeding.\u201cUnder these conditions, my spiritual power depletes much faster \u2026\u201cEvery second I hold on is a challenge for me.\u201cBut \u2026\u201dLu Sheng breathed slowly, his eyes flickering.\u201cIsn\u2019t this what I want? Kekeke \u2026\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s eyes were firm as he straightened his back little by little \u2026\u2026\u201cEight \u2026 eight times the gravity \u2026\u201dOutside the room, a person\u2019s expression was sluggish as he muttered, \u201cHe\u2019s actually trying to stand up.\u201dEveryone\u2019s faces were filled with shock and disbelief. They could no longer find the right words to describe their feelings.After a series of huge shocks, any words or expressions would pale in comparison.There was only one thing they wanted to be sure of: were they dreaming?Was it possible that they had fallen asleep from exhaustion in the process of diligent cultivation, and now he was still living in a dream and had yet to wake up?Yang Yuan covered her mouth with both hands, afraid that she would cry out because she was too excited.Her beautiful eyes were fixed on the young man inside who was trying to stand up little by little.Why was she so excited to see Lu Sheng return?Was it just because they were both from Baihe City?Perhaps even Yang Yuan herself did not realize this.Cao Yong stood in the crowd, the corners of his eyes twitching slightly. His hands were clenched into fists, his nails digging into his palms as if they were about to pierce through his skin.The piercing pain in his palms constantly reminded him that the scene before him was real, but he would rather that it was a dream.\u201cFuck! How can it be so ridiculous!\u201d Cao Yong roared in his heart.\u201cThis guy \u2026\u201dQin Shaojun and Dong Qingxue stood in the distance. With their eyesight, they could clearly see the scene in the training room through the one-way glass window.Beside them was a soldier holding a laptop. The laptop showed the real-time monitoring of the training room.It was obvious that the soldier was greatly shocked. His hands were trembling slightly as he held the laptop.He remembered the trainee on the screen.On the first day of entering the camp, he had beaten a Level 3 First Lieutenant half to death. It seemed that he had just recovered and left the hospital.It was hard not to remember such a monsterous existence. It seemed that this monster had become even more terrifying.\u201cAre you still confident that Xia Lin can defeat him?\u201d Qin Shaojun asked Dong Qingxue.Dong Qingxue\u2019s face was expressionless. After a moment of silence, she said calmly, \u201cBefore becoming a Master, the power of a Spiritual Master is beyond your imagination.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dQin Shaojun nodded helplessly. However, he muttered softly, \u201cStubborn woman, aren\u2019t you afraid that the whetstone will be too hard and break the knife \u2026\u201dSuddenly, Dong Qingxue\u2019s eyes moved. She whispered, \u201cHe\u2019s out.\u201dQin Shaojun looked up into the distance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 \u2014 You Don\u2019t Think Lu Sheng Could Break My Record, Do You?Beep~The prompt made everyone immediately looked towards the display screen outside the room.People had their hearts slightly suspended fearing that the number on the display would accidentally take a jump up again by another notch.\u201cFour minutes, three seconds, and twenty-four milliseconds under 8x gravity \u2026\u201d Someone almost groaned out a value on the screen.The crowd stirred for a moment and then fell into collective silence.At times, when the shock is too much to take in, you simply become numb and get used to it.\u201cThis is not Lu Sheng\u2019s true limit \u2026\u201d Someone was silent for a while and then slowly spoke.No one refuted it, and many people had complex expressions after hearing it. Indeed, almost everyone who has been in the Gravity Training Room understood.In that environment, when you really reached the limit of your physical strength, it would be difficult for you to even move your little finger. You\u2019d have to rely on people outside to help deactivate the gravity.On the other hand looking at Lu Sheng, who not only had turned off the gravity by himself, but he could even stand up and walk. The gap between them and him simply couldn\u2019t be defined with the word \u201cbig\u201d.Creak~The door to the gravity room slowly opened from the inside.Everyone\u2019s expression changed, and then they saw a handsome young man with an upright posture walking out of the room calmly.Lu Sheng.Seeing the group crowding outside the door, Lu Sheng\u2019s face showed no fluctuations.After stopping his cultivation, he released his highly concentrated spiritual power and had already sensed the existence of these people outside the room.\u201cLu \u2026 Lu Sheng, towel \u2026\u201d A medium-sized, slightly overweight boy took the initiative to hand a clean white towel to Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng was stunned for a moment and quickly took the towel. He nodded at the boy and said: \u201cThank you.\u201dHe vaguely remembered this boy. He seemed to be one of the students who came to participate in training from Baihe City this time.\u201cNo \u2026 no need to thank me. It\u2019s my pleasure \u2026\u201d The boy\u2019s face turned red with excitement and he was incoherent.It seemed that Lu Sheng accepting his towel was an extremely glorious and face-saving thing for him. Several people next to him even showed envious expressions.Lu Sheng casually grabbed the towel and wiped off the thin layer sweat on his body. He turned his head to check his performance on the display screen.After seeing the specific statistical time, Lu Sheng showed a regretful expression on his face.If he had known that it would take so little time, he wouldn\u2019t have paid for three hours. He had lost a lot of points in vain.However \u2026 Lu Sheng thought of something and took out his ID card and swiped it on the display screen.He should have broken the record of the Gravity Training Room. If he remembered correctly, there was a point reward for breaking records.Beep beep~A value popped up on the display screen.\u201cBalance: 4,335.\u201dHiss~Before Lu Sheng could speak, there were sounds of deep inhalation, like people were sucking air, from behind him.A full four-digit point value!Many people subconsciously reached out to touch their ID cards in their pockets. A number jumped out in their hearts and then their faces showed a dejected expression.It had to be known that the total sum of points of everyone present wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near half of the points Lu Sheng had.The majority of people did not even have a fraction of the points Lu Sheng had.Was this the difference between us? No, this is the difference between humans and monsters.\u00a0Many people thought firmly in their hearts.\u2026More than 4,000 points. Lu Sheng nodded. That was almost enough for him to squander. Even if he drowned himself in training rooms every day until training camp ended, these points might not be spent.Where should I go next?Lu Sheng thought for a while and quickly determined his direction. The crowd dispersed like tidal water to both sides spontaneously giving way for Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng walked casually in one direction with a light breeze around him. A group of people followed closely behind him while deliberately keeping a certain distance from him.The scene was like a tiger travelling in a forest with hundreds of beasts following behind.\u201cWhere is he going?\u201d Dong Qingxue looked at Lu Sheng\u2019s figure with her eyebrows furrowed.Qin Shaojun looked in a direction for a moment and said thoughtfully: \u201cIt seems like \u2026 the Agility Training Room.\u201dDong Qingxue\u2019s eyes flickered, and she suddenly spoke: \u201cCall Xia Lin over.\u201d\u2026\u201cTraining completed. Result: The second stage (87% completion)! Congratulations, Martial Artist No. RU284363. Your body technique has surpassed 52% of trainees.\u201dThe pleasant prompt sounded and Meng Jinhe stopped his training with a smile on his face. This training session had increased his completion rate by 6% in stage two.He had also surpassed a lot of other trainees during this session. The surpassing rate was a feature of the Agility Training Room.Every performance in the Agility Training Room would be uploaded to the World Martial Alliance terminals to obtain a world ranking in body techniques and combat ability.Although this ranking did not include all martial artists in the world, it was still quite authoritative.Meng Jinhe had completed 87% of stage two in Agility Training Room and surpassed 52% of martial artists worldwide. That was more than half of them!How many martial artists worldwide used the Agility Training \u00a0Rooms? Just one half must include at least several hundred million trainees.Not to mention that it may also include many martial artists whose strength was above oneself. \u00a0Moreover, once oneself makes another breakthrough, one may continue to improve.He saw a very promising future ahead. Meng Jinhe was surrounded by a huge sense of accomplishment and complacency as he walked out of the training room.He was already prepared for how to meet those surprised and admiring eyes outside the door. But his expectations fell short.There was no one outside the training room where usually a crowd would gather, waiting at the door. There wasn\u2019t even someone to hand him water or towels.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Meng Jinhe was puzzled.He had just worked so hard in the training room thinking how shocked people would be of his achievements. He didn\u2019t expect no one to show up. It turned out that he was wrong in expecting something from a blind bunch.\u201cHuff puff~\u201dA man with dark complexion and an honest appearance ran quickly towards Meng Jinhe.\u201cAh! Jinhe! You\u2019re out!\u201d The man saw Meng Jinhe and exclaimed in surprise.\u201cYes.\u201dMeng Jinhe smiled and deliberately looked at the display screen outside the training room with his eyes. He said: \u201cI was in a good form today. There\u2019s been another significant improvement \u2026\u201dMeng Jinhe wanted to mention that he had achieved an 87% completion rate today, but the man didn\u2019t care at all. He just quickly said: \u201cOh, oh! Since you\u2019re done then hurry up! Everyone is here for Lu Sheng \u2026\u201dAfter speaking, he picked up a bottle of water on the ground and ran away without looking back.\u201cHuh\u2026\u201d Meng Jinhe Froze in place, not knowing what expression to make.What happened?He looked in the direction the boy had left, and only then did he notice that just a short distance away from him, a large group of people were gathered there.It was also a Agility Training Room like the one he was in.\u201cIt can\u2019t be that someone broke my record, right?\u201d Meng Jinhe\u2019s first reaction was to think of such a possibility. Other than that, why would they all rush and group up in some other room instead of rushing up to him?Meng Jinhe hurriedly walked towards the room. When he arrived, he swept a glance at the dense crowd and foundd the group of people who would usually follow him around, and went up to them.\u201cWho are you looking at?\u201d Meng Jinhe peered over the shoulder of a man.\u201cJinhe!!\u201dWhen the man saw Meng Jinhe, he hurriedly gave way his position and greeted him warmly: \u201cCome, come here. This is a good location.\u201d\u201cWho the hell are you looking at?\u201d Meng Jinhe got a little impatient.\u201cLu Sheng. We\u2019re looking at Lu Sheng. Lu Sheng just went in!\u201d A person next to him quickly answered.\u201cLu Sheng? The Lu Sheng from Baihe city?\u201d Meng Jinhe froze for a moment, and then said with amusement, \u201cYou guys don\u2019t think Lu Sheng can break my record, do you? Have you gone crazy?\u201dThe person who answered him looked him up and down with a strange look and turned his head away from him. Meng Jinhe was baffled.What\u2019s wrong?\u00a0Had he said something wrong?That Lu Sheng who hadn\u2019t left his room for a month? His strength must\u2019ve definitely taken a plunge after a month of not doing anything.At this time, a familiar boy next to him secretly tugged at Meng Jinhe\u2019s arm and whispered: \u201cJinhe! Don\u2019t say such things. Lu Sheng just broke our training camp\u2019s record in the Gravity Training Room. He persisted for more than four minutes under 8x gravity. He even stunned Cao Yong.\u201d\u201cNow he is preparing to practice body techniques. He might also surpass you \u2026 Let\u2019s watch before we discuss.\u201dBuzz~Meng Jinhe\u2019s head went blank when he heard words like \u20188x gravity\u2019. His mouth gradually opened wide showing an incredulous expression on his face.Eight times the gravity?Four minutes?Lu Sheng???What\u2019s going on?!\u2026\u201cIf the light touches any part of the body then it\u2019s considered a failure \u2026 The difficulty will increase with each stage \u2026\u201dLu Sheng carefully read the introduction of the rules posted on the wall of the Agility Training Room, gaining a general understanding of the rules of this training room.\u201cMy body technique has been stuck at a bottleneck for a while. Although I haven\u2019t had much practical training in the dream world in the past month, the advanced training of \u2018Stellar Body Refining Technique\u2019 has greatly improved various aspects of my physical fitness. With the increase in vitality (BQV) and spiritual power \u2026 There should be a significant improvement in my speed and agility, but I wonder how much I have improved. Now is the perfect time to test it.\u201dWith these thoughts in mind, Lu Sheng reached out and pressed the start button embedded on the wall.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 \u2013 Why did the Second Stage End So Quickly?Beep~The sound of a machine being turned on rang out.The next second, several laser probes on the wall emitted red light and shot several red rays of light straight at Lu Sheng.\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is. So I just need to dodge the rays, right?\u201dLu Sheng leaned slightly to the side, and the red rays swept past him.When he came in, he noticed that the walls around the Agility Training Room were covered with thumb-sized round holes.They were densely packed, no less than tens of thousands in total.Now, it seemed that each of these round holes could shoot out rays of light.\u201cIt seems that not being able to predict where the rays of light will come from is also one of the difficulties of body technique training \u2026\u201d\u201cBut this difficulty doesn\u2019t exist for me.\u201dLu Sheng thought, as if he could predict the future, he stood in place and tilted his head. A red ray of light brushed past his ear and shot into the opposite wall.Spiritual power!Lu Sheng\u2019s huge spiritual power enveloped the entire body technique training room, accurately grasping the changes of each laser probe.Before the red rays of light shot out, he could easily know where all the rays of light were coming from.It was almost like cheating!\u201cIt\u2019s still a bit difficult for me to predict the opponent\u2019s attack by capturing the changes in the opponent\u2019s muscles and expressions in battle. But if it\u2019s a machine, it\u2019s simply too easy.\u201dLu Sheng stood in the centre of the room, thinking about this while moving his body casually, avoiding the rays of light.His posture was calm and collected, as if he wasn\u2019t in the middle of body technique training, but had just woken up early to do morning exercises in the park.Outside the training room, a group of onlookers looked at each other. They looked at each other and saw the deep shock in each other\u2019s eyes.Incomparable shock!\u201cHow did he do it?\u201d Someone couldn\u2019t help but ask.No one could answer.Even Meng Jinhe, who had always boasted of being a genius in body technique and had great confidence in himself, was stunned.Walking into the Agility Training Room, who wasn\u2019t focused, trembling, and highly nervous?There were tens of thousands of laser probes in the training room, and no one knew which ones would shoot out rays of light in the next moment.And if one wasn\u2019t careful and was slightly grazed by the rays of light \u2026You failed \u2026 the training would immediately stop.Meng Jinhe had now reached more than 80% of the second stage. However, this did not mean that he could let his guard down and treat it casually in the first stage.At the most, he could afford to be more skilful and dexterous than others.But what about Lu Sheng?\u201cAre you sure this is his first time in the Agility Training Room?\u201d Meng Jinhe questioned the boy beside him in disbelief.The boy nodded with a complicated expression. \u201cYes, all of us followed him here.\u201dMeng Jinhe fell silent.Looking at the figure strolling leisurely in the room under the elusive light, he fell into deep self-doubt.At this moment, he heard someone say something.\u201cThe first stage is almost over.\u201dBefore he could finish his sentence, he heard a beeping sound. On the small screen outside the room, words popped up: \u201cPreparing to enter second stage of training.\u201dEveryone fell silent.\u2026\u201cHow did this kid do it? Is this really his first time doing agility training?\u201d Qin Shaojun\u2019s eyes were fixed on Lu Sheng in the monitor. He said in disbelief, \u201cWhy does it look like he\u2019s practised it hundreds of times before? Oh no, even if he practised a few hundred times, he wouldn\u2019t be able to do it so easily.\u201cAlthough the first stage of training wasn\u2019t difficult, the arrangement of the light rays during each training session was random and irregular. Why does it seem like he knows where the light rays will come from every time? Tsk tsk, it\u2019s like this again! This is too strange \u2026\u201dDong Qingxue was also staring at the screen, looking up from time to time.Regarding Lu Sheng\u2019s strange behaviour, she had a vague guess in her heart, but she quickly rejected it.\u201cCombat intuition, probably. This kid\u2019s actual combat ability is super strong, so his innate combat intuition must be strong as well. It\u2019s not a big deal for him to do that \u2026\u201d Dong Qingxue explained slowly.Qin Shaojun thought to himself:\u00a0Combat intuition is combat intuition, and clairvoyance is clairvoyance. I can still tell the difference.However, before he could say anything, a quiet girl walked up to the two of them.\u201cHello, Chief Instructor, Deputy Chief Instructor.\u201dWhen Dong Qingxue saw the girl, her gaze softened. She said, \u201cYou\u2019re here. Let me show you something.\u201dThen, Dong Qingxue called out to Qin Shaojun.\u201cLet\u2019s go closer. We can see more clearly.\u201dThe closer they got, the more Dong Qingxue could use her spiritual strength to investigate the situation in the cultivation room.\u2026\u201cThe first stage ended so quickly?\u201d Lu Sheng was a little surprised when he heard the notification.The first stage ended a little too quickly, and the difficulty was a little too low.It did not even force him to use his movement technique. What training was there to talk about?Looks like I can\u2019t keep cheating with my spiritual strength like this. Otherwise, it won\u2019t be effective at all. I\u2019ll use it only when necessary \u2026As Lu Sheng thought to himself, the spiritual strength that enveloped the cultivation room quietly retracted.Suddenly, Lu Sheng\u2019s expression changed slightly.He noticed that not long after he retracted his spiritual strength, another spiritual strength immediately took over the cultivation room. It even scanned his body without restraint.Judging from the strength of the spiritual strength, it should be Dong Qingxue.An idea suddenly popped into Lu Sheng\u2019s mind.Now that Dong Qingxue is here, it seems like I can implement my plan \u2026At the same time, outside the cultivation room.Dong Qingxue\u2019s expression changed slightly. She thought to herself,\u00a0I was overthinking.She turned her head and said to Xia Lin, \u201cObserve Lu Sheng\u2019s strength carefully. He should be your biggest opponent in this training camp \u2026\u201dXia Lin nodded and said, \u201cOh.\u201dThen, she tried to use her spiritual strength to infiltrate the Agility Training Room bit by bit.Under the probing of her spiritual strength, Lu Sheng\u2019s figure seemed to be standing right in front of her.Xia Lin couldn\u2019t help but tremble as she swallowed her saliva.\u201cCome on, Xia Lin. You can do it! This person might not be as scary as you think. Defeat him, remove the shadow, and fix your mental weakness. Come on, you can do it!\u201dXia Lin desperately encouraged herself in her heart as she \u2018stared\u2019 at Lu Sheng without blinking.She had to admit that this person\u2019s figure was very good, and he was also very good-looking.Xia Lin looked at Lu Sheng\u2019s streamlined and well-proportioned muscles and slender body. She could not help but have a thought in her mind.\u201cLet me feel it and see how strong it is!\u201dMm, just a simple touch.Just a simple sense of Lu Sheng\u2019s strength.Xia Lin comforted herself and then used her spiritual strength to carefully place it on Lu Sheng\u2019s body. The moment her mental strength landed, a strong electric shock was transmitted back to her.Xia Lin let out an \u201cah\u201d and quickly retracted her spiritual strength.Then, she saw Lu Sheng cast a deep look in her direction. His eyes warning her.\u201cHe \u2026 he saw me? He knows that I\u2019m sensing him? \u2026\u201d Xia Lin was instantly stunned. She stood there in a daze and did not move.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Dong Qingxue\u2019s puzzled voice sounded in her ear.Xia Lin came back to her senses and subconsciously shook her head. \u201cNo \u2026 nothing.\u201dXia Lin did not dare to tell Dong Qingxue. She did not know if what she had just experienced was real or an illusion.In her field of vision, Lu Sheng was still standing there with a calm expression as if nothing had happened.\u201cMaybe \u2026 maybe \u2026 it really was my illusion.\u201d Charlene thought to herself.However \u2026 Xia Lin looked at Lu Sheng again and could not help but retract her spiritual strength.This person was still very scary. He seemed to have become even scarier than before.I should stay away from him \u2026\u2026\u201cLooking is one thing, but what do you mean by sensing? That\u2019s too much \u2026\u201dIt was very rude to use one\u2019s spiritual strength to casually probe others. If one offended a powerful and ill-tempered martial artists, one could very well be killed.It was necessary for Lu Sheng to give this person who had rashly probed him a little warning.He did not need to guess to know that this reckless spiritual strength belonged to Xia Lin.Lu Sheng did not continue to care about Dong Qingxue and Xia Lin. He turned his attention back to the Agility Training Room in front of him.The second stage had begun.Swoosh!Six red rays shot out at the same time, criss-crossing toward Lu Sheng.Compared to the first stage, the number and speed of the rays in the second stage were much higher.The red rays were silent. There was no sound as they pierced through the air, and there was no trace of them.Without the foresight of his spiritual strength, Lu Sheng could only rely on his reflexes and body movement speed to dodge them.It was more than enough.Completion rate 10% \u2026Completion rate 20% \u2026Completion rate 30% \u2026Lu Sheng calmly passed the first 80% of the second stage of the training.Until after 80%.Only then did his expression become slightly more serious.But it was only slightly serious.After breaking through the first bottleneck, the movement technique that was stuck at the second bottleneck was still more than enough for him to handle this level of training.After all, the training with the powerful zombies in the dream world was no joke.Moving among a group of zombies was much more exciting than dodging the rays in the training room.As the number of rays increased, the speed also increased as well.Lu Sheng gradually felt that his body movement technique that was stuck at the second bottleneck was beginning to loosen.He had accumulated enough.As long as there was a little pressure, breaking through would be a simple matter.But just as Lu Sheng was beginning to feel a little excited and expectant \u2026The ray\u2019s momentum came to an abrupt halt.Beep!Lu Sheng was stunned for a moment, then quickly reacted.Damn, the second stage of the training had ended. How did it end so fast \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 \u2014 Lu Sheng\u2019s Sense of Ease, Breakthrough, Intricate Realm!\u201cCleared \u2026 cleared?\u201d It was a confused and probing voice.A few seconds later, the voice became high-pitched and excited.\u201cCleared! Lu Sheng cleared it! Lu Sheng completed the second stage of the movement training!\u201dExcept for a few people who were excited, many people were confused. They looked at each other and didn\u2019t react.It wasn\u2019t until the words \u201cPreparing to enter the third stage of training\u201d popped up on the small screen outside the room that they really realized.Yes, Lu Sheng had completed the second stage of the movement training.It was all done.Boom!The crowd went into an uproar and then burst into fierce exclamations.\u201cDamn, the second stage of the movement training cleared just like that? I didn\u2019t even notice!\u201d\u201cMe too, it felt like it was over in a jiffy. That was too fast!\u201d\u201cWhy does it feel different from the second stage I\u2019ve seen before \u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, it felt like Lu Sheng\u2019s second stage training was very easy.\u201dThe onlookers discussed. In addition to being surprised, most of them were surprised and puzzled.In their view, Lu Sheng\u2019s second stage training was completely different from their impression of the second stage of the movement training. It seemed like \u2026 It was simply too easy.Someone faintly said, \u201cWhat\u2019s very easy? It\u2019s just that Lu Sheng was too relaxed with his performance.\u201dThe crowd quieted down. Many people suddenly realized.It seemed like that was the case.It was because Lu Sheng was too relaxed and casual.So much so that when they were watching, they unconsciously had the illusion of it being too easy, such that they even felt that they could do it themselves.Many things in life were the same.The same principle was applied here.It wasn\u2019t that the second stage of the movement training was easy, but that the person they were watching was stronger and better.In the past, when they practised by themselves or watched others practice, they felt that it was very difficult. Now that they were watching Lu Sheng, they naturally felt that the second stage\u2019s difficulty had decreased.After thinking it through, a huge sense of shock gradually emerged from the bottom of their hearts. Looking at Lu Sheng\u2019s calm face in the room, everyone\u2019s eyes suddenly changed.\u201cJust how powerful must his movement skills be to be able to make us feel so relaxed?\u201dSomeone murmured. The onlookers all had complicated expressions and were speechless.Cleared it just like that?\u00a0Meng Jinhe was still in a state of confusion. He stood there in a daze, unable to accept what he was seeing.He had worked so hard for the second stage in the Agility Training Room. It was Lu Sheng\u2019s first time training, and he had completed it so easily?It was as if he had taken a fancy to an expensive toy and had worked hard to save up his pocket money for it. Just as he was about to save up enough money, he saw a child around the same age as him casually take out more money than he had saved for a few months and buy the toy casually.The huge psychological gap made Meng Jinhe lose all his fighting spirit in an instant. It was as if he could not find his goal and direction. He did not understand the meaning of his efforts.The blow was too great.If Meng Jinhe were to enter the Agility Training Room now, it was hard to say if he could achieve the same results as before.Not far away, Qin Shaojun, Dong Qingxue, and Xia Lin were also watching this scene.Dong Qingxue narrowed her eyes and asked, \u201cYou can tell?\u201dQin Shaojun nodded and replied with a complicated expression, \u201cIt\u2019s a Perfection Realm Body Movement Technique, and it\u2019s not just any Body Movement Technique. He\u2019s probably been in the Perfect Realm for a while now. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have been so relaxed \u2026\u201dDong Qingxue could not help but exclaim, \u201cPerfection Realm Fist Technique and Perfect Realm Body Movement Technique \u2026 How did this kid cultivate? He\u2019s never been on the battlefield. How can he cultivate to this level at his age in the safe zone?\u201dQin Shaojun said helplessly, \u201cYou have to admit that there are indeed a handful of people in this world who have talent and talent that is several times, or even more than ten times, more than the average person. Do you still think Xia Lin can defeat him now?\u201dDong Qingxue did not answer. She only said calmly, \u201cLet\u2019s continue watching.\u201dXia Lin, who was beside her, trembled when she heard that. She carefully raised her head and glanced at Dong Qingxue. She seemed to want to say something, but she shut her mouth.At this moment, Lu Sheng had already begun the third stage of body movement training in the training room.From the perspective of the onlookers, it was obvious to them Lu Sheng\u2019s previously relaxed actions would start to falter this time around.The difficulty of the third stage of training suddenly increased by several times compared to the second stage.The criss-crossing red rays that appeared and disappeared mysteriously. Even just by looking at them, one could feel an immense pressure coming at them.Many times, almost everyone thought that Lu Sheng was going to fail. However, in the next second, they saw him dodge by a hair\u2019s breadth.The entire process was fraught with danger. They could not help but worry about him.\u201cLu Sheng is reaching his limit.\u201d Dong Qingxue suddenly spoke.She, who was observing Lu Sheng closely with her spiritual strength, was more aware of his current state. It was obvious that he had reached his body\u2019s reaction limit. As long as the next wave of rays had an increased difficulty, he would have no choice but to fail.There was no need to continue watching.Qin Shaojun glanced at the training progress and said, \u201cIt\u2019s also very impressive. He\u2019s already broken the record of the Agility training Room in the training camp. Tsk tsk \u2026\u201dThe two of them were about to look away when they suddenly heard Xia Lin, who was beside them, exclaim.Then, there was a commotion among the crowd gathered outside the cultivation room not far away.Dong Qingxue suddenly extended her spiritual strength.She suddenly realized \u2026 Lu Sheng was still going!\u201cThis kid \u2026\u201d Qin Shaojun was also a little surprised. He hurriedly fixed his eyes on the screen. Soon, his eyes widened. Traces of shock crept into his pupils.Finally, Qin Shaojun raised his head abruptly. He was looking at Dong Qingxue, who had a shocked expression on her face. He slowly uttered a few words.\u201cIntricate Realm!\u201dIn the distance, Lu Sheng, who was in the training room, seemed to have regained his former relaxed mindset he had in the second stage.\u2026\u201cI\u2019ve finally broken through.\u201dLu Sheng heaved a long sigh of relief. There was a hint of joy in him.He had deliberately suppressed himself. He did not use any additional techniques and only relied on his body movement to dodge the rays.As a result, he successfully broke through the second bottleneck of his body movement technique. With this level of body movement technique, his body\u2019s reflexes had reached an unimaginable level.It had even surpassed the speed of his nervous reaction.There was almost no need to think. His body subconsciously executed a perfect dodge.\u201cWith such a body movement technique, I can even try to challenge Master-level zombies in the dream world \u2026\u201dAs Lu Sheng thought, he carefully felt the unique experience brought about by this level of body movement technique.After the breakthrough in body movement technique, the third stage of training also became easier.60% completion rate \u202670% \u202680% \u2026Beep!Accompanied by a soft sound \u2026 The third stage of body movement technique training had ended.Lu Sheng stopped moving his body. He calmed his breathing and quietly recovered his strength. He began to feel a little excited. He really wanted to know now.If he used all the remaining techniques and the body movement technique after the breakthrough, to what extent could he pass this body movement technique training course?It had been a long time since he encountered such an interesting game in real life.Compared to the crudeness of the Gravity Training Room, Lu Sheng still preferred this kind of technical and challenging thing.\u2026\u201cOh my god \u2026\u201dOutside the training room, the group of onlookers had already been shocked to the point of numbness. The third stage of body movement technique training had been completed.These few words made them dizzy.While most people were struggling in the first stage, a monster suddenly appeared who completed the third stage in one breath.That kind of feeling really made people doubt their lives.It was estimated that the previous record holder of the Agility Training room would also doubt his life when he saw Lu Sheng now.Meng Jinhe was completely speechless. His expression was numb. He was like a walking corpse.Cao Yong was observing him. Seeing him like this, he suddenly felt a lot better.Lu Sheng was a fucking monster, a demon! Moreover, he could not bear the immense pressure from this freak alone.Yang Yuan and the other students from Baihe City were so excited that they were going crazy.\u00a0Although they did not know why they were so excited.But \u2026 Lu Sheng had broken the record for both the Gravity Training Room and the Agility Training Room. Moreover, he had broken the record in an unprecedented manner.As people from Baihe City \u2026 They were proud of him!Lu Sheng\u2019s halo enveloped them. They stood in the crowd and looked at the shocked faces around them. They felt like they were shining too.Lu Sheng was awesome! Baihe City was awesome!\u2026Both Qin Shaojun and Dong Qingxue were equally astonished. How long had it been since they finished talking about the Perfection Realm Body Movement Technique?Lu Sheng had broken through right under their noses.He had broken through to the Intricate Realm.The Intricate Realm!That was the Intricate Realm!Even the veterans who had been on the battlefield, those Level 4 and 5 Martial Artists \u2026How many of them could train their body movement technique to the Intricate Realm? And Lu Sheng had done it just like that?It was effortless.It was as simple as eating and drinking.\u201cI remember that I broke through to the Intricate realm when I was 22 years old.\u201d Qin Shaojun said.Dong Qingxue glanced at him and said indifferently, \u201cI was 25 years old.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m a fucking Speed type Martial Artist! Speed-type! It\u2019s a natural addition for body movement technique cultivation!\u201d Qin Shaojun was going crazy. He wanted to reach out and scratch his head.\u201cHow old is this kid this year? Seventeen! And he\u2019s a fucking Strength-type Martial Artist. Is this reasonable? Do you think this is reasonable?!\u201dDong Qingxue was silent for a moment and said, \u201cYou said it yourself. There are a small group of people in this world who have several times more gifted and talented than ordinary people in certain aspects \u2026\u201dQin Shaojun was rendered speechless by Dong Qingxue\u2019s words. He froze on the spot. A few seconds later, he cursed in a low voice, feeling extremely depressed.\u201cFuck!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 \u2013 Breath of the Wind, Sense of Time, Level 3 Spiritual Master!Ignoring the gloomy Qin Shaojun, Dong Qingxue thought for a moment and looked down at Xia Lin.\u201cDo you think that if you break through and become a Level 1 Spiritual Master and can control six Star Awls, you\u2019ll be able to \u2026\u201dThere was a hint of anticipation in Dong Qingxue\u2019s words. However, Xia Lin did not wait for her to finish her sentence and immediately shook her head. Like a rattle-drum.\u201cThat\u2019s impossible, Instructor Dong. I\u2019m still lacking a lot \u2026\u201dXia Lin was not stupid. She could guess what Dong Qingxue meant. She wanted her to challenge Lu Sheng? She refused!She might have had some thoughts prior to this. After all, Lu Sheng was a scar in her spiritual power. She had to find a way to make up for it.However, that was just a thought. But now \u2026\u00a0Stop kidding! She did not want to fight such a perverse guy.She had seen Lu Sheng\u2019s performance in the Agility Training Room clearly with her spiritual Strength, especially during the third stage.Xia Lin felt that she might not be able to dodge the dense net of rays even if she controlled the Star Awls.However, Lu Sheng cleared it.He, despite his gains in physique, managed to not suffer a single hit from those attacks.That was ridiculous!How could she treat such a freakishly strong and terrifying guy as an opponent?Spiritual setback?There was nothing to do about it.She would not die if she did not do it, but if she did \u2026 She might be beaten to death by that guy. Just like the instructor during the entrance examination.She could still remember the day of the assessment. Lu Sheng had grabbed one of the young instructor\u2019s legs, as he was lying on the ground like a corpse.She still had lingering fears when she thought about it.Dong Qingxue saw the determination on Xia Lin\u2019s face and suddenly felt a little helpless. She could only nod and say, \u201cAlright.\u201dXia Lin immediately let out a long sigh of relief.\u2026At the moment, Lu Sheng had already begun the fourth stage of the body movement training in the Agility Training Room.Dozens of densely packed rays formed a mesh-like net of beams, which only a small square in between the interspersing lines.It was also shockingly fast. It was almost instantaneous.Lu Sheng, who had just broken through to a new realm, immediately felt waves of pressure after regaining a sense of ease.Lu Sheng took a deep breath. The rhythm of his breathing underwent a miraculous change at that moment.\u201cSwitch to Wind Breathing Technique!\u201dIn an instant, Lu Sheng\u2019s body seemed to be surrounded by a gentle breeze. His already extremely fast speed suddenly became even faster.This was the second special breathing technique that Lu Sheng had comprehended during his month-long seclusion.Wind Breathing Technique!In the eyes of outsiders, Lu Sheng\u2019s current speed was already fast enough to become a phantom. They could no longer see Lu Sheng\u2019s movements clearly. He could only catch a glimpse of the mesh appearing and disappearing in a flash.Lu Sheng\u2019s body seemed to sway.Then, he cleared.As for how he cleared? There was simply no way to understand.Many people looked at the mesh of rays that was as fine as a fishing net, their expressions shocked and confused.They simply couldn\u2019t understand it.The distance between them was so small, and they couldn\u2019t touch each other at all.How did Lu Sheng pass through?Shrinking in the blink of an eye and then expanding in the blink of an eye?Come on, this isn\u2019t a fantasy movie plot.At this moment, Lu Sheng\u2019s figure quickly became tall and distant in the eyes of the students. His entire body was surrounded by a thick sense of mystery.The unknown was the easiest thing to inspire awe in people.\u201cThis kid doesn\u2019t just have the Intricate Realm Movement Technique. His physical fitness and reaction speed are also frighteningly fast. It\u2019s definitely not something an ordinary Level 3 Martial Artist can achieve \u2026\u201d Qin Shaojun smacked his lips and sighed.Dong Qingxue did not say anything.At this moment, she had already spread her Spiritual Strength throughout the entire training room, observing Lu Sheng from all angles.She was trying to dig out something from Lu Sheng. If not for the fear of affecting Lu Sheng, her Spiritual Strength would have clung onto Lu Sheng\u2019s body.As time went on, it was getting harder and harder for Lu Sheng to dodge.Every time the mesh of rays swept past, he had to make a few or even a dozen dodging movements in less than a second. Outsiders would not know that there was actually a gap in space between the mesh.They seemed to sweep past at the same time, but there was actually a difference in speed between them. What Lu Sheng needed to do was to use this time difference to quickly dodge the rays one after another.One could imagine how difficult this was.\u201cThe speed boost from the Wind Breathing Technique isn\u2019t going to be enough \u2026\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s breathing was getting faster and faster, and more sweat was seeping out of his body. His crystal-clear eyes were getting brighter and brighter, like the stars in the sky.\u201cI\u2019m almost at my true limit.\u201d Lu Sheng narrowly dodged another round of rays.He glanced at the data on the wall of the room \u2014 the completion rate of the fourth stage was 23%.\u201cThen \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng took a deep breath, and a bright light suddenly bloomed in his eyes.\u201cI\u2019ll give it my all!\u201d In the next breath, the enormous spiritual strength in his mind suddenly exploded.The two strands of spiritual strength that were entrenched in the surrounding air were forcibly squeezed out by his sudden outburst.In his chest, his two hearts were beating loudly, and his blood was roaring in his veins. At this moment, Lu Sheng felt as if the walls were rapidly moving away from him.Everything in front of him was magnified and being slowed down.Lu Sheng could clearly see streaks of red light moving towards him at a rather slow speed. This feeling was very strange, as if the flow of time had slowed down.Lu Sheng had a sudden epiphany. He recalled the information about spiritual masters he had found through the Photon Mind in the dream world.\u201cIf I remember correctly, this state, in the professional terminology of spiritual masters, should be called \u2026 Time Perception!\u201dThe feeling of time being stretched out. The manifestation of a qualitative change in Spiritual Energy.This qualitative change would usually only occur in \u2026 A Level 3 Spiritual Master!In other words, after tirelessly cultivating the advanced chapter of Crystal Visualization, Divine Illumination Meditation Scripture, for more than a month, Lu Sheng had finally officially stepped into \u2026 The ranks of a Level 3 Spiritual Master!\u2026At the same time, outside the cultivation room.Boom!A loud explosion startled everyone in the training hall.Everyone looked in the direction of the explosion in shock and bewilderment.They saw their Genius Training Camp\u2019s chief instructor, Dong Qingxue, standing not far away from them. She was staring in the direction of the training room, and her expression had turned strange.Under Dong Qingxue\u2019s feet, the hard magnetic tiles shattered into a large spider web patterns. Waves of terrifying and powerful Blood Qi waves were recklessly erupting from Dong Qingxue\u2019s body.\u201cAre you crazy?!\u201dQin Shaojun exclaimed in disbelief. He did not notice that Xia Lin, who was beside him, had her mouth agape and eyes wide open. She looked as if her heart was about to jump out of her chest.Dong Qingxue stared blankly at the training room for a long time, turning a deaf ear to the surrounding reactions.The Blood Qi waves on her body only calmed down when the strange light in her eyes slowly faded away.Dong Qingxue slowly turned her head and looked directly into Qin Shaojun\u2019s eyes. Then, she said softly in a low and strange tone, \u201cLu Sheng is a Spiritual Master. And his Spiritual Strenght \u2026 is not inferior to mine.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Qin Shaojun exclaimed. He did not seem to understand.Three seconds later, a loud \u201cWhat the fuck!\u201d resounded through the training hall.Boom!Another terrifying Blood Qi wave erupted with a loud bang. Large patches of tiles on the ground were shattered. Only this time, all the cracks came from under Qin Shaojun\u2019s feet.The students in the distance were all confused and baffled. They did not know what was going on. To be able to make the two chief instructors act strangely as if they had taken too many drugs \u2026A round of meshes quickly swept past.Lu Sheng\u2019s body suddenly froze. Then, he quickly relaxed and stood quietly where he was.He had failed.Lu Sheng\u2019s expression was a little regretful, but he also realized that he had indeed reached his limit.Although he had activated \u201cTime Perception\u201d and used the Wind Breathing Technique and the Divine Illumination Meditation Scripture to increase his Blood Qi \u2026 His raw strength was still a little lacking.Being able to see the ray\u2019s trajectory clearly did not mean that he could dodge it.Time had been \u201cstretched\u201d, but Lu Sheng\u2019s own movements had also been slowed down. In the end, the ray\u2019s speed became faster and faster. He really could not keep up.\u201cUnless my Blood Qi and physique continue to make breakthroughs, this is my true limit.\u201d Lu Sheng looked at the final result on the wall in the room.\u201cTraining completed. Training result: Stage Four completion rate: 56%! Congratulations to Martial Artist RU 285632. Your movement technique has surpassed 97% of the trainees.\u201dA pleasant notification sounded in the room. Lu Sheng listened to the final result report and secretly reminded himself in his mind.\u201cThere are still three percent of trainees who are better than me in terms of movement techniques. How many martial artists are there in the world? Three percent is at least a few million. I\u2019m still very weak. I need to work harder.\u201dWith that thought, Lu Sheng pushed open the door of the Agility Training Room and stepped out.The crowd at the door was already petrified.Their mouths were wide open, and their expressions were exaggerated as if someone had just punched them in the head.They watched Lu Sheng walk out of the training room, their minds still echoing with the results.\u201cStage Four completion rate: 56% \u2026\u201d\u201cHis movement technique has surpassed 97% of the martial artists in the world \u2026\u201d\u201cHow many martial artists are there in the world? There must be at least a few hundred million of them. Lu Sheng is already ahead of hundreds of millions of people in terms of movement techniques \u2026\u201dMeng Jinhe, in particular, was even more dizzy.He remembered that his previous result report was that he had surpassed 52% of the martial artists in the world. Lu Sheng\u2019s was 97%.There was a difference of 45% between him and Lu Sheng.45% of the martial artists in the world.In other words \u2026 In terms of movement technique, which he was most proud of, there was a difference of a few hundred million ranks between him and Lu Sheng!!!Meng Jinhe\u2019s pride and self-esteem were shattered into pieces.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78: Breath of Flame, Lu Sheng\u2019s Ultimate Punch!Lu Sheng grabbed a towel from a dazed girl beside him and slowly wiped the sweat off his body. His gaze passed through the crowd and landed on Dong Qingxue, who was dozens of meters away.A huge amount of spirituality seeped out of his body.An invisible wind blew at the corners of the crowd\u2019s clothes. At that moment, they felt the light in front of them quickly dim as a large shadow rose from behind Lu Sheng.There seemed to be an invisible tornado roaring above Lu Sheng\u2019s head.\u201cThis \u2026\u201dThe expressions of the trainees changed from shock to horror. They subconsciously stepped back and looked at Lu Sheng as if they had seen a ghost.At that moment, Lu Sheng gave them a terrifying feeling. It was like the dark clouds before a storm. Terror was brewing in the silence, accompanied by a low pressure that made it difficult for them to breathe.Lu Sheng\u2019s face was calm.The powerful spiritual strength of a Level 3 Spiritual Master had caused such a small impact on the people around him.He looked at Dong Qingxue from afar.Although the two of them were still trainee and Chief instructor of the training camp, after becoming a Level 3 Spiritual Master, he was qualified to talk to Dong Qingxue as an equal even if he was not as powerful as her. Dong Qingxue was also looking at Lu Sheng. Her beautiful eyes were shining.She knew what Lu Sheng meant by releasing his spiritual strength.This was an ancient etiquette between Spiritual Masters. It was like shaking hands in modern society or clenching fists between ancient martial artists.However, it was a strange feeling.Dong Qingxue had never thought that she would one day be able to perform such an etiquette with a seventeen-year-old boy. Moreover, it was almost as if they were equals.Beside Dong Qingxue, Xia Lin was like a frightened little rabbit, curling up behind Dong Qingxue\u2019s back. Her spiritual strength, which was not even at Level 1, was stuck between Dong Qingxue and Lu Sheng, trembling.In Xia Lin\u2019s eyes, Lu Sheng was like a demon surrounded by a thunderstorm at that moment.The shadow in her heart was growing bigger and bigger.It was too scary \u2026Dong Qingxue retracted her spiritual strength and turned to leave. Lu Sheng heaved a sigh of relief.It seemed that Dong Qingxue had acknowledged his existence.His trump card as a Level 3 Spiritual Master had been exposed. He would probably be treated differently from now on. Lu Sheng thought as he held the towel that he had used to wipe his sweat.At this time, a pair of a girl\u2019s small hands suddenly reached over and quickly took the towel in his hand, and then handed over a bottle of water.Lu Sheng raised his head and saw that it was Yang Yuan.\u201cLu Sheng, where are we going next?\u201d Yang Yuan\u2019s fair and delicate face was slightly flushed because of her excitement. She looked at Lu Sheng with eyes full of worship and expectation, just like a fangirl.\u201cThe Combat Training Room, or \u2026\u201d Yang Yuan reported the names of all the training rooms in one breath.Lu Sheng was stunned. He looked around and found that everyone was looking at him with the same expression. They were like a group of soldiers with high morale, waiting for their general to lead them to conquer new continents one after another.Lu Sheng laughed involuntarily and shook his head.\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\u201cUh \u2026\u201dYang Yuan was stunned for a moment.Lu Sheng looked up at the giant electronic clock on the far wall and said, \u201cIt\u2019s almost time for dinner. Eating is the most important thing.\u201dWith that, Lu Sheng turned around and left calmly.Behind him was a group of stupefied students.After lunch, Lu Sheng did not go to the training room. He had achieved his goal of testing his strength. There was no need to waste time on other things.Lu Sheng had done his research. The only cultivation rooms in the training camp that were valuable to him were the Gravity Training Room and the Agility Training Room.After returning to the dormitory, Lu Sheng continued to shut himself in and quietly carried out his original homework.With four Level 11 techniques, he was pressed for time. He could not even sleep at night. Lu Sheng had already planned it out. From now on, he only needed to spend one to two hours in the Gravity and Agility Training Room every day.He practised the Stellar Physical Refinement Technique a few times. When evening came, a soldier came running to inform him.\u201cLu Sheng, the Chief Instructor wants to see you.\u201dFinally, it was here. Lu Sheng was not surprised. He packed up a little and followed the soldier out. Along the way, Lu Sheng noticed that the patrolling soldiers in the base were all looking at him in awe.It seemed that his performance in the training room had spread throughout the camp. Martial artists worshipped the strong, especially in the military camp.Dong Qingxue\u2019s office was located in the deepest part of the training camp. When Lu Sheng arrived, he saw Xia Lin walking out of Dong Qingxue\u2019s office.Xia Lin\u2019s expression and posture were originally quite calm. She was quiet and gave people the impression that she was quiet and obedient.However, when she saw Lu Sheng, her body immediately tensed up.Her walking posture also became unnatural. She lowered her head and walked closer to the wall.When Lu Sheng was about to walk past her, Xia Lin even buried half of her face in the wall. It was as if she was being punished to face the wall and reflect on her mistakes. She did not dare to move at all.\u201cDo I look that scary?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy are you so afraid of me?\u201d Lu Sheng was speechless. He had always had a good impression of Xia Lin.Looking at Xia Lin\u2019s expression, Lu Sheng had a bad idea. When he walked past Xia Lin, he deliberately coughed and stomped his foot heavily.It was as if he was stepping on Xia Lin\u2019s tail.Xia Lin\u2019s entire body trembled as if she had been electrocuted. She ran out and disappeared in the blink of an eye.\u201cHaha \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng could not help but laugh.\u201cStop teasing her. You\u2019re the one who scared her.\u201d A voice came from the front.Lu Sheng looked up and saw Dong Qingxue standing at the door with her arms crossed.\u201cHello, Chief Instructor.\u201dDong Qingxue nodded at him and said, \u201cCome in.\u201dLu Sheng followed Dong Qingxue into the office. Dong Qingxue\u2019s office was much bigger than Lu Sheng had imagined.After entering, he saw a rock table that was more than five meters long and two meters wide. A handsome young man with a melancholy expression leaned against the edge of the table with a cup of coffee in his hand.It was Qin Shaojun.At the end of the office was a huge instrument with a huge screen and control panel. This instrument alone took up at least a third of the space in the office.Even so, there was still at least a hundred square meters of empty space in the middle.When Qin Shaojun saw Lu Sheng enter, the coffee cup in his hand trembled violently. Then, his eyes stared straight at him as if he was looking at an alien.\u201cHello, Chief Instructor Qin.\u201d Lu Sheng greeted him politely.\u201cHello, hello.\u201d Qin Shaojun\u2019s expression was complicated. No one knew what he was thinking.\u201cTake a seat.\u201d Dong Qingxue gestured for Lu Sheng to sit. Then, she said, \u201cI invited you here mainly to do a simple strength test on you. Then, I\u2019ll discuss something with you.\u201dLu Sheng had guessed that this would happen before he came, so he stood up quickly.\u201cSure.\u201dThere were professional testing instruments in Dong Qingxue\u2019s office.There was a BQV testing device, one equipment to measure the Combat Power Index, and one that he had never seen before.Dong Qingxue took out a disposable blood collection needle and handed it to Lu Sheng. She asked, \u201cHave you tested yourself recently?\u201dLu Sheng shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201dDong Qingxue was puzzled. \u201cAren\u2019t there blood test instruments in the student dormitories?\u201dLu Sheng hesitated for a moment, then answered honestly, \u201cThe needle can\u2019t pierce through my skin.\u201dPfft!Qin Shaojun spat out his coffee when he heard this. Then, he pointed at Lu Sheng and shouted at Dong Qingxue, \u201cI told you, this kid has definitely reached Level 3 and is starting to temper his bone and muscles. His skin is so tough!\u201dDong Qingxue took out a new packet needles from the drawer with a complicated expression and handed it to Lu Sheng.\u201cThis is a needle specially prepared for Level 5 Martial Artists. It should be able to pierce through your skin.\u201dLu Sheng was deep in thought.It seemed that Dong Qingxue and Qin Shaojun were both Level 5 Martial Artists. Otherwise, they would not have been equipped with Level 5 blood collection needles.The tip of the Level 5 needle was a beautiful bright gold. It easily pierced through Lu Sheng\u2019s skin that had been tempered by the advanced chapter of the Stellar Body Refinement Technique.A drop of red blood rolled down the test tube, and a blue light shone down.Dong Qingxue and Qin Shaojun stared at the BQV testing instrument\u2019s display subconsciously.Soon, a number popped up on the display.\u201c123.651\u201d\u201cHiss, hiss \u2026\u201d Qin Shaojun gasped softly. He could not help but exclaim.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen such a young Level 3 Martial Artist in almost ten years.\u201dDong Qingxue\u2019s eyes also contained a hint of shock, but her expression was still calm.\u201cTest your combat strength.\u201d She said to Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng was not surprised that he had become a Level 3 Martial Artist. He already had a hunch in his heart when he started to cultivate the advanced chapter of the Stellar Body Refinement Technique.However, he really could not estimate the exact value of his combat strength.He only knew that he had definitely become a Level 4 Martial Artist, but he did not know how much he had exceeded the minimum combat strength standard of a Level 4 Martial Artist.He could use this opportunity to test it out.Lu Sheng walked to the instrument that tested his combat strength and took a deep breath.There seemed to be flames rising in his eyes.\u201cBreath of Flames!\u201dBoom!In an instant, there seemed to be a ball of flames exploding in Lu Sheng\u2019s chest. Even his breathing became hotter.Breath of Flames!The Stellar Body Refinement Technique made his physique as hot as fire, planting a star-like seed in his body.Comprehending the [Flame Breathing Technique] was a matter of course. When the conditions were right, success would come naturally.Therefore, the Breath of Flames was also the breathing technique that Lu Sheng had comprehended the earliest and the deepest when he cultivated the advanced chapter of the Natural Breathing Technique.However, he had never used it in battle.The Breath of Flames affected Lu Sheng\u2019s entire body. It was as if there were streams of heat flowing in his blood vessels.His two hearts were beating rapidly.His Qi and blood were roaring.Divine Illumination Meditation Scripture!Breath of Flames!Perfection Realm Fist Technique!Eight times the Stellar Power Generation!Since he was going to test it, he would give it his all.Let me see how my combat strength fares!\u00a0Lu Sheng aimed at the slot of the instrument and punched out.At this moment, his eyes were as bright as stars.Boom!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 \u2014 CPI: 270,000, Five Times the Spiritual Strength Purity!A number popped up on the screen.\u201c271,920 \u2026\u201dCrack!The coffee cup in Qin Shaojun\u2019s hand shattered into pieces. His expression was as exaggerated as if someone had punched him in the stomach.Dong Qingxue was in a slightly better state than him, but the sudden constriction of her pupils betrayed her current state of shock.A total of 270,000 combat power! It was a terrifying number.It was infinitely close to the level of a Level 5 Martial Artist.\u201cEven if this kid doesn\u2019t have the talent of a Spiritual Master, he\u2019s still a monster!\u201dQin Shaojun pointed at the number on the device and shouted, \u201cIs this something a human Level 3 Martial Artist can achieve? It\u2019s said that strength-type martial artists are strong in the early stages, but I\u2019ve never seen one this strong. Xiang Peng was nothing compared to him back then!\u201dDong Qingxue\u2019s expression was complicated.Just as Qin Shaojun said, with Lu Sheng\u2019s abnormal improvement speed and ridiculous Combat Power Index, even if he was not a Spiritual Master, he was definitely a top martial artist.Strength-type talents were not as good as speed-type and defense-type talents, but if one was as strong as Lu Sheng \u2026Those two were right.Those who could defy all perceptions could not be measured by common sense.Most importantly, Lu Sheng was a spiritual master, and he was extremely talented, almost comparable to Qin Shaojun.When the two were combined, the word \u201cterrifying\u201d could not even begin to describe it.In Qin Shaojun\u2019s words, it was hard to believe that humans could give birth to a monster like Lu Sheng if I didn\u2019t see it with my own eyes.Lu Sheng was a little surprised himself.He knew that his current combat power would be very high, already exceeding 100,000.However, he did not expect it to be so high, reaching 270,000, almost comparable to a Level 5 Martial Artist.No one would believe that a Level 3 Martial Artist could achieve the combat power of a Level 5 Martial Artist, crossing two levels.\u201cThe main reason is that my Stellar Power Generation Technique has broken through to eight times, plus the vitality enhancement effect of the Divine Illumination Meditation Scripture \u2026 With all kinds of Level 11 secret techniques combined, it would be strange if I couldn\u2019t achieve this level \u2026\u201dLu Sheng thought to himself.Dong Qingxue and Qin Shaojun took a long time to calm down from the shock on their faces.\u201cYou are now at the standard of an Official Level 3 Martial Artist.\u201dDong Qingxue turned on the printer in the office and said to Lu Sheng, \u201cThe military is still qualified to assess a martial artist\u2019s strength. I\u2019ll write a report for you and go to the Martial Arts Association later. When the time comes, you can directly raise the level \u2026\u201d\u201cThank you, Chief Instructor Dong.\u201dDong Qing Xue signalled that she was fine, then said to Lu Sheng, \u201cIs it convenient for me to test your Spiritual Strength level here?\u201dLu Sheng was stunned. He subconsciously looked at the third instrument in the room that was placed together with the blood and strength measuring instrument.Just as he had expected, Dong Qingxue walked up to the device and said, \u201cYes, this is the device developed by the Association for Spiritual Masters. It\u2019s used to test one\u2019s spiritual strength.\u201dDong Qingxue gently placed her hand on a light yellow hexagonal crystal protruding from the device.\u201cThis is called an energy crystal. It\u2019s a special type of crystal ore that was discovered more than a hundred years ago in the Lion Kingdom\u2019s Anstra Canyon. It has an extremely strong absorption reaction spiritual power. Later, it was developed into a tool specifically used to test the spiritual strength of a spiritual master \u2026\u201d\u201cDuring the test, you only need to focus and infuse a portion of your spiritual strength into it. For example, me \u2026 \u201d As Dong Qing Xue spoke, a strange light flashed in her eyes.Then, the light yellow crystal under her hand immediately began to glow, emitting a beautiful warm yellow light.From Lu Sheng\u2019s point of view, Dong Qingxue looked like she was holding a fluorescent tube.Beep! Beep!As the device beeped, two numbers popped up on the device\u2019s display.\u201cSpiritual Strength: 143.24\u201d\u201cPurity: 4.2\u201d\u201cYour strength has improved again. Even the purity of your spiritual energy has increased a lot. I remember that you were only a little over 3 the last time \u2026\u201d Qin Shaojun came over and sighed as he looked at the numbers on the device.Dong Qingxue glanced at him and said calmly, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m like you? You\u2019re just wasting your life away.\u201dQin Shaojun jumped up. \u201cDong Qingxue, you can insult me, but you can\u2019t insult my lifestyle!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLu Sheng listened to the conversation between the two from the side.He could tell that whether it was Dong Qingxue or Qin Shaojun, their backgrounds were not simple.Other than being able to become a major at such a young age and being the chief instructor and deputy chief instructor of a provincial-level training camp, their manner of speech and temperament were also different from ordinary people. One look and one could tell that they were not cultivated by a respected family.Noticing Lu Sheng\u2019s thoughtful gaze, Dong Qingxue realized that she and Qin Shaojun were acting a little undignified. She quickly cleared her throat and straightened her posture. \u201cCome, give it a try,\u201d she said to Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng nodded and walked to the device.Following Dong Qingxue\u2019s demonstration, he placed his hand on the light yellow crystal in the middle of the device.Qin Shaojun hurried over as well.Dong Qingxue had clearly told him that Lu Sheng had an extremely powerful talent as a spiritual master and that his spiritual strength was not inferior to hers.However, he had not seen it with his own eyes, so he was still doubtful.How old was Dong Qingxue this year? How old was Lu Sheng this year? Lu Sheng was a genius monster, but Dong Qingxue was not any worse.There was a difference of more than ten years between the two of them \u2026\u201cIf you say that Lu Sheng is half as strong as you, I\u2019ll believe you. But saying that he\u2019s not any weaker than you \u2026 I really can\u2019t accept that \u2026\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dDong Qingxue glared at the muttering Qin Shaojun and said coldly, \u201cDon\u2019t disturb the test.\u201dQin Shaojun quickly shut his mouth and stared at the device obediently.At this moment, Lu Sheng had already injected his spiritual energy into the light yellow crystal in his hand as Dong Qingxue had taught him.The crystal began to emit a warm light like a fluorescent tube, but it did not have any temperature. It was cold to the touch. Lu Sheng felt as if he was holding an icicle that could not be heated.Soon, two numbers appeared on the device.Dong Qingxue and Qin Shaojun hurriedly looked up.It was just a glance, but both of them looked as if they had seen a ghost.\u201cHow is this possible?!\u201dThis time, it was Dong Qingxue who cried out. Dong Qingxue stared at the two numbers on the device. Her beautiful eyes were wide open, filled with shock and disbelief.\u201cSpiritual Strength: 113.56\u201d\u201cPurity: 20.3\u201dThe first number was nothing.Dong Qingxue had already felt that Lu Sheng\u2019s spiritual strength was very strong when they were in the training room. He had already entered the ranks of a Level 3 Spiritual Master.Now that the test results were out, her judgment was proven correct.What really shocked Dong Qingxue was the second result.Purity (Spiritual Energy): 20.3!It was five times more than hers!What did that mean?This meant that if Dong Qingxue compressed and purified her spiritual power by five times, she would be almost at Lu Sheng\u2019s level.However, was that possible?It was extremely difficult for a spiritual master to purify even a little bit of spiritual power, let alone increase it by five times!Just as Qin Shaojun had said before, the purity of Dong Qingxue\u2019s spiritual energy had increased from three to four.Although it was only a little bit of an increment, Dong Qinxue had worked hard for two whole years! One could only imagine how shocked Dong Qingxue was.At this moment, the way Dong Qingxue was looking at Lu Sheng had completely changed. If Dong Qingxue had thought that Lu Sheng was a monster and a genius before \u2026Now, she felt that the calm and handsome young man standing in front of her was an out-and-out pervert, a freak, and inhuman!A 17-year-old Level 3 Spiritual Master was already ridiculous enough. Moreover, the purity of his spiritual energy was five times that of an ordinary Level 3 Spiritual Master \u2026 Oh, no, he was not an ordinary spiritual master.She, Dong Qingxue, was considered one of the best among Level 3 Spiritual Masters. Therefore, the purity of Lu Sheng\u2019s spiritual energy would be even more ridiculous than that of an ordinary spiritual master!For a moment, Dong Qingxue even had the urge to dissect Lu Sheng\u2019s brain and study it carefully.\u201cOh my god \u2026\u201d Qin Shaojun was also stunned.Although he was not a spiritual master, he had an outstanding family background. In addition, he had Dong Qingxue by his side. Under her influence, he still had a discerning eye.He did not know what 20 points of purity meant. However, he knew. Lu Sheng was awesome! Very awesome! He was so awesome that he was about to ascend to the heavens!\u201cDo you have a teacher? Have you learned spiritual power cultivation techniques before?\u201d Dong Qingxue stared into Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes and asked quickly.Lu Sheng hesitated for a moment and nodded.\u201cYes, I have a teacher. My teacher taught me a technique to cultivate spiritual power.\u201dLu Sheng knew that with his current level of spiritual power, it was difficult to use talent as an excuse.He might as well admit it openly. And in a sense, Lu Sheng wasn\u2019t lying. He did have a teacher.His teacher came from 10,000 years in the future.His strength had reached Level 11.His name was \u2014 Duan Yifeng!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 \u2014 Qiming Star\u201cAs expected \u2026\u201d Dong Qingxue\u2019s expression relaxed when she heard Lu Sheng\u2019s answer.It was normal for him to have a master. A situation where Lu Sheng did not have a master, yet for him to reach this stage relying purely on his talent \u2026 she could simply not accept such a situation.\u201cActually, the purity of my spiritual power was not that high. I only reached this level after cultivating the cultivation method my master gave me \u2026\u201dThe first time was when he successfully visualized a crystal figure. The second time was when he successfully transformed the crystal figure into a diamond figure. Lu Sheng thought to himself.\u201cThat\u2019s enough to prove that you indeed possess strong talent \u2026\u201d Dong Qingxue could not help but exclaim.\u201cYou must have awakened your talent not long ago, right?\u201d\u201cLess than three months ago.\u201dThere was nothing to hide regarding it. It would be clear at a glance if one checked his information.\u201cTsk tsk \u2026\u201d Dong Qingxue looked at Lu Sheng enviously. \u201cYou have a spiritual power closer to Level 2 and Level 3 soon after you awakened your spiritual power, and with such high levels of purity \u2026 Even in the Spiritual Master Association, there won\u2019t be many monsters like you to come in the next few decades.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s an association for spiritual masters?\u201d Lu Sheng could not help but ask.\u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d Dong Qingxue was a little surprised, but she quickly reacted. \u201cYour master probably didn\u2019t tell you on purpose, afraid that it would affect your cultivation. After all, the more you know, the more distracting thoughts you have, which will affect the purity of your spiritual power.\u201cBut since you\u2019ve mentioned it, I\u2019ll tell you a few things. There\u2019s an association for spiritual masters too, but not many people know about it. Its location is also more secretive than the average Martial Artist Association.\u201cThe strength of a Spiritual Master can also be officially recognized. You\u2019re now qualified to participate in the Spiritual Master Assessment. If necessary, I can write you a recommendation letter. Of course, it has to be on the premise that your master doesn\u2019t object \u2026\u201dDong Qingxue emphasized the last sentence as if it was a taboo.\u201cMy master shouldn\u2019t object. In fact, I\u2019ve never seen what he really looks like. Every time he teaches me, his method is very mysterious \u2026\u201dLu Sheng did not even blink.He had mastered the technique of making up stories. Every sentence was true, but every sentence was poles apart from the truth.\u201cYour master is probably an amazing person \u2026\u201d Dong Qingxue was in awe. This could be seen from his attitude toward Lu Sheng and the way he taught Lu Sheng. She inferred.For someone as talented as Lu Sheng, most people would have treated him like a golden nugget after discovering him.The teacher that Lu Sheng spoke of was still allowing him to develop freely. He didn\u2019t even want to show his face.Only someone with a very high status could do things like this. Thinking of this, Dong Qingxue felt much better. Lu Sheng was monstrous, but his monstrous talent was supported by external conditions.As expected, there was no such thing as a random genius in this world. Even Lu Sheng, who had a simple background, had a powerful and mysterious spiritual master teacher.\u201cActually, I invited you here today to discuss a few things with you \u2026\u201d Dong Qingxue calmed herself down a little and sat down in front of her desk.Qin Shaojun also put away his sloppy appearance and sat obediently at the side.\u201cChief Instructors, please speak.\u201d\u201cThe first thing \u2026\u201d Dong Qingxue gave Qin Shaojun a look. Qin Shaojun took out a bank card from his pocket and handed it to Lu Sheng.\u201cHere\u2019s five million. It\u2019s your reward for securing first place in this training camp, plus the extra reward for your outstanding performance \u2026\u201dAlthough the training camp was not over yet.Lu Sheng\u2019s performance today had firmly established his position as the overlord.Unless someone among the remaining students suddenly had a huge breakthrough, it was impossible to shake Lu Sheng\u2019s position.However, the probability of that happening \u2026 was still much higher than the probability of Qin Shaojun not slacking off starting from the day after.\u201cDon\u2019t be dissatisfied. This is the maximum amount we can grant \u2026 The Eastern Military Region has always been tight on military funds. Most of the funds for this training camp were spent on providing you guys with three meals a day \u2026\u201dQin Shaojun looked at Lu Sheng and pursed his lips. \u201cYou\u2019re famous in the training camp for having a big appetite. The total cost of the all the food you\u2019ve eaten during your stay would tally up to about ten million.\u201dLu Sheng was speechless.\u201cAre you joking?!\u201dDong Qingxue glared at Qin Shaojun and said seriously to Lu Sheng, \u201cMr. Lu Sheng, although this amount is not at all satisfactory, it\u2019s enough to prove the sincerity of the Eastern Military Region (Dongning) \u2026\u201dLu Sheng caught the word \u2018Eastern Military Region\u2019 in Dong Qingxue\u2019s words and said thoughtfully, \u201cIs this \u2026 recruitment?\u201d\u201cYou can take it that way.\u201dDong Qingxue nodded and said, \u201cMartial arts geniuses like you will have to go to the battlefield in the future no matter what. You can\u2019t raise a True Dragon Martial Saint in the safe zone! The country and Martial Alliance don\u2019t give martial artists all that support and privilege for free.You\u2019ll have to reach this stage sooner or later.\u201cWe hope that when you\u2019re faced with the choice of military region, you\u2019ll prioritize the Eastern Military Region \u2026\u201d\u201cThe Eastern Military Region is good. The female soldiers, all have big breasts and long legs.\u201d Qin Shaojun sang loudly.Lu Sheng was speechless.\u201cAlright.\u201d Lu Sheng took the bank card and said seriously, \u201cI accept this sincerity. I\u2019ll consider it carefully.\u201dDong Qingxue seemed to have been waiting for this promise. She smiled.\u201cThen let\u2019s talk about something else.\u201dDong Qingxue looked straight into Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes and said seriously, \u201cMajor Qin Shaojun and I have decided that you\u2019ll represent the Dongning Province\u2019s Genius Training Camp to participate in the Eastern Province\u2019s [*means the entire region] Qiming General Selection \u2026\u201d\u201cQiming General Selection?\u201d Lu Sheng was shocked.\u201cYes.\u201dDong Qingxue explained, \u201cAll the provinces in the Eastern Province will hold genius training camps like ours every year. The purpose is to select the true geniuses with the potential to become Qiming General (Rising Star). You should know what a General represents, right? \u201dLu Sheng nodded and uttered two words.\u201cGrandmaster.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dDong Qingxue continued, \u201cA Qiming General is a future Grandmaster, a General Star in preparation. There\u2019s only one such person in the entire Eastern Province every year. And this one was selected from the many chief candidates of the various provincial Prodigy Training Camps.\u201cAlthough there\u2019s only one Qiming General, and even if you become one, you\u2019re not destined to become a Grandmaster.\u201cHowever, as long as you get it, you\u2019ll definitely leave a mark on your resume. Anyone who participates will have this on their records. And this be will be very helpful no matter where you go in the future. Think about it, Lu Sheng.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to think about. I\u2019ll go.\u201d Lu Sheng agreed without hesitation.Since he lived in this era, there were some things that were unavoidable.Lu Sheng was very ambitious. He wanted to change the fate of the entire human race with his own strength. He wanted to turn the tide and be the fire that started the inferno.The moment this belief was planted, it was destined that he would not choose peace in the future.*[*Peace was never an option!\u2570\uff08\u2035\u25a1\u2032\uff09\u256f]Since he would have to fight the foreign beasts on the battlefield sooner or later, why should he think about it when there was such a good opportunity in front of him?\u201cAlright.\u201dDong Qingxue was very satisfied with Lu Sheng\u2019s attitude. She praised, \u201cMajor Qin and I both believe in your ability. If even you can\u2019t do it, then no one in the Dongning Province can.\u201cOh right, I forgot to tell you. The rewards for this Qiming General Selection are directly issued by the Eastern Military Region. It\u2019s much more generous than what our little Prodigy Training Camp can provide.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d This was also Lu Sheng\u2019s goal all along. By displaying more talents, he would be able to obtain more resources.\u201cThere are still few months before the Qiming General Selection begins. It\u2019ll only officially start after all the provincial training camps have ended. I\u2019ll let you know when it\u2019s time.\u201cIn any case, I won\u2019t let you miss the college entrance examination \u2026\u201dDong Qingxue blinked and smiled. \u201cIn fact, with your current ability, it doesn\u2019t matter if you take the college entrance examination or not. You can choose any martial arts university in the entire Eastern Military Region.\u201d\u201cThen, do I still need to stay in the training camp?\u201dLu Sheng asked.Dong Qingxue replied, \u201cIt\u2019s up to you. If you want to stay, you can stay. If you don\u2019t want to, you can leave at any time.\u201dLu Sheng thought for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ll stay for a while longer.\u201dAlthough the training camp was meaningless to him, at least there was still the Gravity Training Room and Agility Training Room that were very helpful to him.Moreover.The food here was really good.\u201cThis kid is definitely staying for the food \u2026\u201d Qin Shaojun secretly said to Dong Qingxue.Lu Sheng, \u201c\u2026\u201dAfter listening to Dong Qingxue explain everything, Lu Sheng simply bid farewell and left.Watching Lu Sheng\u2019s back disappear at the door, a complicated look appeared in Dong Qingxue\u2019s eyes.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that I, Dong Qingxue, would be jealous of someone because of their talent \u2026\u201d Dong Qingxue sighed and said softly.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dQin Shaojun could not help but sigh. \u201cLu Sheng is really a monster. We should be glad that we didn\u2019t get into the same batch as him. Otherwise, the psychological trauma left by Xiang Peng can\u2019t compare to him.\u201d\u201cI really feel sorry for the other brats in this batch. They\u2019re probably going to be so shocked that they\u2019ll start doubting their lives.\u201d Qin Shaojun had a gloating expression on his face.Dong Qingxue rolled her eyes at him and did not say anything.\u201cOh, right.\u201d Qin Shaojun suddenly thought of something and said with a smile, \u201cWith Lu Sheng in this Qiming General Selection, won\u2019t we win for sure? When the time comes, the two of us will definitely be rewarded. I didn\u2019t expect to be able to get such a great merit for free on a holiday. I, Qin Shaojun, am indeed a winner in life. Hahaha \u2026\u201dDong Qingxue was not as optimistic as him.\u201cDon\u2019t celebrate too early. Although Lu Sheng is a monster, there are hundreds of millions of people in the entire Eastern Military Region. It\u2019s not impossible for there to be a few monsters like Lu Sheng every year.\u201cHave you heard of this saying?\u201cIt\u2019s easy to pass the imperial examination, but difficult to win the martial arts championship. There are too many geniuses and monsters in this world \u2026\u201dQin Shaojun was silent.After a while, he said in all seriousness, \u201cQingxue, you\u2019re so sexy when you pretend to be meaningful. I almost fell for you \u2026\u201dDong Qingxue, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cQin Shaojun, do you want to die?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m joking. Ah, don\u2019t hit my face!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 \u2014 If I knew earlier, I would have asked Xia Lin to take care of youBaihe City, Martial Artist Association.In the president\u2019s office, Xiao Yuhe led an old man in a Chinese tunic suit to sit in front of the coffee table.\u201cSit, sit, sit, Old Xia.\u201dXiao Yuhe\u2019s face was flushed red as he happily poured tea for the old man in the Chinese tunic suit. \u201cIt\u2019s rare for you to go out, yet you actually thought of coming to see me. Not bad, not bad. Quick have a taste of the tea!\u201dThe old man in the Chinese tunic suit took a sip of the tea in front of him and said with surprise, \u201cYo, Xiao Yuhe, you\u2019re even willing to take out this kind of top-grade Da Hong Pao tea to entertain me. It seems like you\u2019ve encountered something good recently. What, did the old tree sprout and change your mistress?\u201d\u201cPei pei! What are you talking about \u2026 what change of mistress? I don\u2019t have any mistress.\u201dXiao Yuhe\u2019s old face was dark as he unhappily said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been my old comrade for more than thirty years. It\u2019s rare for you to come, so how can I not properly entertain you?\u201d\u201cOh~~\u201d The old man in the Chinese tunic suit let out a long \u2018oh\u2019 and did not continue. He only quietly looked at Xiao Yuhe, waiting for him to continue.Sure enough, Xiao Yuhe chuckled and pretended to be reserved. \u201cHowever, there is indeed something good.\u201d\u201cSomething good? Tell me.\u201d The old man in the Chinese tunic suit took a sip of tea and said leisurely.This undoubtedly scratched Xiao Yuhe\u2019s itch. Xiao Yuhe\u2019s interest was immediately piqued as he smiled and said, \u201cThis year, I found a good seedling on the martial path, a genius. Can you guess what happened? Seventeen years old, a Gifted Martial Artist. His BQV has reached Level 2, and his battle prowess has even broken through Level 3! Amazing, right?\u201cWhen you were seventeen years old, what was your strength? Your BQV probably didn\u2019t even break through Level 2 \u2026 Just in time, this good seedling is coming to find me today. Later, I\u2019ll let you see what my Baihe City\u2019s top genius looks like \u2026\u201dXiao Yuhe spat out all the joy in his heart in one breath. His face was slightly red from happiness as he sat on the chair, waiting for the old man\u2019s shocked and envious expression.However, contrary to his expectations, the old man in the Chinese tunic suit was unperturbed. His face did not have a single ripple, and he even let out a disdainful snort.\u201cOld Xiao, just this?\u201d The old man looked at Xiao Yuhe as if he was a country bumpkin and said disdainfully, \u201cA seventeen years old Level 2 Martial Artist with battle prowess of a Level 3, and he\u2019s also a Gifted Martial Artist. Just this? Is this the top genius of your Baihe City?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that enough?\u201d \u00a0Xiao Yuhe became anxious and said somewhat unconvinced, \u201cThen call one out and show me what a true martial genius is like!\u201dThe old man in the Chinese tunic suit looked down at the tea leaves in the cup and blew gently.\u201cI can\u2019t now.\u201d\u201cThen what the hell are you talking about!\u201d Xiao Yuhe was so angry that he laughed.The old man suddenly changed the topic and explained, \u201cI can\u2019t say it now, but that doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t be able to say it in the future.\u201dXiao Yuhe was stunned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dThe old man didn\u2019t answer directly. Instead, he looked at Xiao Yuhe and asked, \u201cIf I\u2019m not wrong, the top genius you mentioned was sent to participate in the Dongning Province\u2019s Prodigy Training Camp, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Xiao Yuhe nodded. \u201cHe just came back from training today.\u201d\u201cMy ass!\u201d The old man said, \u201cDo you know why I have time to come and see you this time?\u201d\u201cYou missed your old comrade?\u201d Xiao Yuhe was puzzled.\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you think I can\u2019t call? And why would I especially come all the way to Baihe City for an old man like you? \u201d\u201cThen what are you here for?\u201dThe old man slightly raised his chin, his face revealing a proud expression. Arrogantly, he said, \u201cI\u2019m here to send my precious granddaughter to the training camp. While I\u2019m here, I\u2019m also here to have a look at you \u2026\u201d\u201cYour granddaughter?\u201d Xiao Yuhe frowned and sensed that something was wrong.Sure enough, the old man said with a smile, \u201cYes, my Xia family finally produced a spiritual master. She was specially recruited to participate in some training camp, so I can\u2019t help but look after her. If she gets hurt, then my heart will ache to death.\u201d\u201cSpiritual master?!\u201d Xiao Yuhe stood up from his seat and his face revealed a look of disbelief. \u201cYour granddaughter is a spiritual master? Is that true?\u201dSeeing Xiao Yuhe\u2019s reaction, the old man\u2019s wizened face bloomed like a flower. He said, \u201cHow can it be a lie? I reckon that she will be an official Level 1 Spiritual Master when she comes back from the training camp. Ai, I wonder if a seventeen-year-old Level 1 Spiritual Master can compare to a seventeen-year-old Level 2 Martial Artist \u2026 A seventeen-year-old Level 2 Martial Artist. Truly amazing \u2026 \u201dThe old man sighed eccentrically. Xiao Yuhe\u2019s face immediately turned as black as a pot of charcoal. It was incomparably unsightly.However, he could only swallow his anger and sit back in his chair while panting with rage. A spiritual master was a completely different concept from ordinary Gifted Martial Artists.Spiritual Masters were much rarer than ordinary Gifted Martial Artists. They could be considered as strategic talents.These rare talents were like a giant panda. There were only a few in the entire Baihe City. Who would have thought that Old Man Xia\u2019s family would actually encounter one.Damn it, his ancestral grave must\u2019ve been spewing out green smoke.No wonder he was so kind as to come and see him. It turned out that he was already waiting to show off in front of him.Lu Sheng\u2019s talent was not bad, but compared to Old Man Xia\u2019s granddaughter, it was indeed incomparable. He was practically an ordinary person.A seventeen-year-old Level 1 Spiritual Master\u00a0\u2026 Xiao Yuhe looked at old man Xia\u2019s complacent old face. He was so envious that he wanted to gnash his teeth.\u201cOh, right, I forgot to tell you something.\u201d The old man in the tunic suit seemed to have thought of something and added, \u201cThe Dongning Province\u2019s Prodigy Training Camp has not ended yet. My granddaughter even video-called me yesterday. She said that it would take at least another month. The genius from your Baihe City came back early. Do you understand what I mean?\u201dWhen Xiao Yuhe heard this, his face turned even darker. Of course, he understood what it meant.It meant that their Baihe City\u2019s top genius was not strong enough and had been eliminated by the Prodigy Training Camp.To think that he had wanted to show off Lu Sheng\u2019s talent in front of this old man. He did not expect that the old man would use his own granddaughter to ridicule and humiliate him, pressing him to the ground and rubbing the fact against him.Damn it, this was a slap in the face. His mind was numb. His distance from the Grandmaster Realm was probably a few tens of thousands more \u201cGod\u201d characters away.Thinking of this, Xiao Yuhe felt as if there was something in his chest that he could not spit out. He could only remain silent and sullenly sit on the chair while drinking tea.\u201cI say, Old Man Xiao, don\u2019t be too angry. Take it easy. Not everyone can be as outstanding as my precious granddaughter. There are many people who are far worse than my precious granddaughter Xia Lin. Your Baihe City\u2019s genius is not one of them \u2026\u201dThe old man in the tunic suit comforted Xiao Yuhe \u2026Xiao Yuhe\u2019s face turned even uglier.At this moment, the sound of knocking came from outside the office.\u201cCome in.\u201dXiao Yuhe suppressed his anger and shouted.Soon, the office door opened, and the secretary led a handsome and tall youth in.\u201cPresident, Lu Sheng is here.\u201d\u201cOh, is that so? Lu Sheng, come in quickly.\u201d Xiao Yuhe forced a smile and waved at Lu Sheng, who was standing at the door.\u201cHello, President Xiao.\u201d Lu Sheng walked into Xiao Yuhe\u2019s office and noticed that there was another person in the office. It seemed to be Xiao Yuhe\u2019s friend.\u201cOld Xiao, is this the top genius from your Baihe City that you always wanted to show me \u2026\u201dWhen the old man in the tunic suit saw Lu Sheng, he immediately stood up and smiled, \u201cYou are indeed a young talent. Not bad, not bad.\u201dOnly Xiao Yuhe could hear the sarcasm in the old man\u2019s words. He smiled at Lu Sheng with an ugly expression and waved his hand to send the secretary out.\u201cThis is \u2026 my old comrade. You can call him Old Xia.\u201d Xiao Yuhe introduced.\u201cHello, Grandpa Xia.\u201d\u201cHello, hello.\u201dThe old man in the tunic suit smiled brightly and patted Lu Sheng\u2019s shoulder, \u201cHe is the same age as my family\u2019s Xia Lin. If there is a chance, we can meet later. What do you say, Old Xiao?\u201dXiao Yuhe\u2019s face darkened, \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a need for that.\u201dWhat, did he feel that this humiliation wasn\u2019t enough? Did he want to gather everyone and humiliate him?\u201cLook at my mind!\u201d The old man smiled and patted his forehead. He smiled and said to Lu Sheng, \u201cLu Sheng, right? Did you just come back from the Dongning Province\u2019s training camp?\u201dAlthough Lu Sheng felt that the atmosphere in the office wasn\u2019t right the moment he entered, and Xiao Yuhe\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t right, since Xiao Yuhe said that the old man was his friend, he didn\u2019t think too much about it and nodded, \u201cYes, Grandpa Xia. My training ended, so I came back.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good that it ended. It\u2019s good that you came back early.\u201dThe old man said leisurely, \u201cThat kind of place really isn\u2019t suitable for ordinary people like you. Although my family\u2019s Xia Lin is outstanding, she often complains to me about how tough it is. She even says that there are many monsters in the training camp \u2026 Even my family\u2019s Xia Lin thinks that there are monsters. Do you think a normal person can stand it? Why did she have to suffer such a blow? Oh, by the way, young man, do you know my family\u2019s Xia Lin?\u201dLu Sheng was stunned. This old man had been talking about something he didn\u2019t understand for a long time. So he was Xia Lin\u2019s grandfather.He thought of Xia Lin, who would either run or pretend to be a quail every time she saw him, and then looked at the old man in front of him.Lu Sheng revealed a strange expression, but he still nodded.\u201cI do. Xia Lin is very famous in the training camp.\u201dThis sentence immediately comforted the old man. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud, \u201cMy family\u2019s Xia Lin is definitely outstanding wherever she goes. What a pity, young man. If I had known that you were a talent that Old Xiao valued, I would have gotten Xia Lin to take care of you in the training camp. That way, you wouldn\u2019t have been eliminated so early. Don\u2019t you think so, Old Xiao?\u201dXiao Yuhe looked at the old man\u2019s hypocritical expression and snorted coldly without saying a word.Lu Sheng seemed to understand something. He thought for a moment and tried to explain, \u201cActually, I\u2019m not\u2014\u201dBut before he could finish, he was interrupted by Xiao Yuhe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82 \u2014 A Month Ago, He Beat Everyone in the Training Camp Into Submission\u201cLu Sheng, you came to find me as soon as you came back. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d Xiao Yuhe gave Lu Sheng a crazed look, hinting that he shouldn\u2019t give Old Man Xia the chance to show off.Lu Sheng laughed in his heart, but he still took out a document sealed in kraft paper from his backpack and handed it to Xiao Yuhe.\u201cThe Training Camp\u2019s Chief Instructor, Dong Qingxue, asked me to pass this to you. She hopes that you can approve it.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of document would the Chief Instructor of the Training Camp give to a small Baihe City Martial Arts Association President for approval?\u201dBefore Xiao Yuhe could say anything, Old Man Xia, who was beside him, leaned his head over. He glanced at Lu Sheng and said with a strange expression, \u201cYoung man, did you do something wrong in the training camp that made Old Xiao, the one who recommended you, take the blame for you?\u201dLu Sheng couldn\u2019t be bothered with him.He could tell.This old man was really annoying. No wonder Xiao Yuhe\u2019s face was so ugly when he came in. He was probably angered by him.\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business. Shut your mouth!\u201d Xiao Yuhe scolded Old Man Xia, then tore open the kraft paper and took out the document inside. Xiao Yuhe\u2019s gaze quickly swept through the contents of the document.At first, it was calm. When his gaze swept to a certain part, suddenly \u2026 Xiao Yuhe\u2019s hand that was holding the document trembled violently.He suddenly raised his head and looked at Lu Sheng in front of him. His eyes widened, and his face revealed an extremely shocked and incredulous expression.\u201cYou \u2026 You \u2026\u201d Xiao Yuhe\u2019s voice trembled as he spoke.\u201cWhen did you break through to become a Level 3 Martial Artist?\u201dOld Man Xia, who was standing beside Xiao Yuhe, stopped sipping on his tea. He raised his head and looked at Xiao Yuhe with an expression that said he doubted his ears. \u201cAh?\u201dNo one bothered with him.\u201cAbout a month ago,\u201d Lu Sheng said calmly. \u201cThe Chief Instructor of the Training Camp tested me. She said that the military region has the qualifications to certify a martial artist\u2019s strength. I just need you to stamp it.\u201d\u201cQualified, of course you\u2019re qualified! You\u2019re too qualified! Your Chief Instructor represents the Eastern Military Region!\u201dXiao Yuhe\u2019s entire person came alive in an instant. His back became straight, his face was radiant, and his eyebrows were raised as if they were dancing.He was like a completely different person!\u201cI\u2019ll stamp it for you now!\u201d Xiao Yuhe was elated, and his face was flushed red. He took the document and was about to walk to the back of the office desk to look for the official seal.However, Old Man Xia grabbed him.\u201cWait!\u201dOld Man Xia screamed at the top of his lungs. \u201cShow me the documents! Seventeen years old, Level 3 Martial Artist \u2026 Is this for real? Don\u2019t tell me he got a fake document from somewhere to fool you?\u201dOld Man Xia looked at Lu Sheng from head to toe in surprise.A seventeen-year-old Level 3 Martial Artist. It was a completely different concept from a 17-year-old Level 2 Martial Artist.Even though the two of them were only one level apart, there was a difference of 90 BQV between them. It wasn\u2019t something that could be easily bridged.The difference in talent between the two was like heaven and earth.If he really was a seventeen-year-old Level 3 Martial Artist, then his martial arts talent was terrifying, almost comparable to his granddaughter Xia Lin\u2019s spiritual master talent.How could this \u201cordinary\u201d kid in front of him be a Level 3 Martial Artist? How could she compare to his precious granddaughter? Old Xia couldn\u2019t accept this and was filled with doubt.Before Lu Sheng could speak, Xiao Yuhe had already retorted. \u201cCan\u2019t you see the huge steel seal of the Eastern Military Region? Fake documents? Go get me a fake document so that I too can see it for myself!\u201dOld Man Xia\u2019s face turned red from Xiao Yuhe\u2019s rebuke. He couldn\u2019t help but shout, \u201cSo what if it\u2019s real? There are Level 3 Martial Artists everywhere. They\u2019re just a bit younger. They\u2019re still not as strong as my granddaughter!\u201dXiao Yuhe glanced at Old Man Xia and sneered, \u201cThen what if it\u2019s a Level 3 Martial Artist with a CPI of more than 270,000, almost reaching the standard of a Level 5 Martial Artist?\u201d\u201c270,000? CPI!\u201d Old Man Xia almost couldn\u2019t breathe.He swallowed his saliva and said in disbelief, \u201cGive me the documents. Let me see!\u201dXiao Yuhe didn\u2019t stop him and let Old Man Xia snatch the documents away.Old Man Xia\u2019s eyes quickly scanned the documents, and shock slowly crept onto his face. Finally, he jerked his head up and stared at Lu Sheng in disbelief.\u201cYou\u2019re someone who was eliminated early from the training camp. How can you have a Combat Power Index of 270,000?\u201dLu Sheng looked straight into Old Man Xia\u2019s eyes and said calmly, \u201cI didn\u2019t say I was eliminated. It\u2019s just something you made up yourself.\u201d\u201cThen why did you come back early before the training ended?\u201d Old Man Xia questioned.Lu Sheng said calmly, \u201cFor me, the training could have ended a month ago. I just chose to come back now.\u201d\u201cOh, right, President Xiao \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng turned to look at Xiao Yuhe and said, \u201cThe Chief Instructor wants you to call her back. She\u2019s afraid that you won\u2019t believe this document and wants to verify it with you in person.\u201d\u201cHahaha, why wouldn\u2019t I believe it? Am I such paranoid person?\u201d Xiao Yuhe laughed heartily. When he said \u201cparanoid,\u201d he specially glanced at Old Man Xia beside him.\u201cBut I still have to make this call \u2026\u201d Xiao Yuhe took out his phone and said with a smile, \u201cI heard that the Chief Instructor of this training camp is a famous genius in the Eastern Military Region. Let\u2019s pay our respects and make a video call.\u201dAfter he said that, Xiao Yuhe made the video call on his phone.Old Man Xia stared at the screen of Xiao Yuhe\u2019s phone without blinking. Soon, the video call connected, and Dong Qingxue\u2019s figure appeared on the screen.Dong Qingxue didn\u2019t seem to be in the office. Strange noises could be heard from time to time. It was the sound of something flying through the air.\u201cPresident Xiao Yuhe from Baihe City?\u201d Dong Qingxue looked a little surprised, but she quickly gained her composure and greeted Xiao Yuhe seriously.\u201cThat\u2019s me. I\u2019m Xiao Yuhe. Hello, Chief Instructor Dong.\u201d Xiao Yuhe replied with a smile.\u201cHello, President Xiao. I\u2019m guessing Lu Sheng has returned to the Baihe City\u2026 \u201dDong Qingxue\u2019s gaze fell on Old Man Xia, who was craning his neck to look around. She couldn\u2019t help but frown and ask, \u201cThis is?\u201dOld Man Xia puffed out his shrivelled chest and said, \u201cI\u2019m Xia Weixing from Baoding City!\u201dDong Qingxue shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know you.\u201dOld Man Xia, \u201c\u2026\u201dOld Man Xia looked embarrassed. Suddenly, he seemed to remember something and quickly said, \u201cI\u2019m Xia Lin\u2019s grandfather!\u201dIt worked this time. Dong Qingxue looked enlightened and said calmly, \u201cHello, Grandpa Xia.\u201dOld Man Xia heaved a sigh of relief, but he felt a little helpless. After living for so long, he didn\u2019t expect that he still had to rely on his granddaughter\u2019s name to be recognized. How sad.At that moment, a small head suddenly popped out from behind Dong Qingxue and looked at the screen and cried out in surprise.\u201cGrandpa! Where are you? Why are you video-chatting with Chief Instructor Dong?\u201dOld Man Xia saw Xia Lin and immediately became excited. However, before he could say anything to Xia Lin, Dong Qingxue turned around and scolded coldly, \u201cXia Lin, did you achieve the goal I set for you? You still have the energy to be distracted? You\u2019ll be doing ten times the usual today!\u201d\u201cYes, Chief Instructor Dong \u2026\u201d Xia Lin replied meekly and disappeared from the screen.Old Man Xia\u2019s heart ached, but he was too embarrassed to say anything. Even if he said anything, judging by the Chief Instructor\u2019s personality, she probably wouldn\u2019t give him any face.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll let you get back to business, Chief Instructor Dong. If you two want to chat, go ahead.\u201dXiao Yuhe pushed Old Man Xia aside and said to Dong Qingxue on the screen, \u201cChief Instructor Dong, I\u2019ve read the document you asked Lu Sheng to bring to me. I\u2019ll get it done for him soon.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dDong Qingxue nodded. \u201cSorry to trouble you, President Xiao.\u201d\u201cWhat trouble are you talking about? Lu Sheng is the pride of our Baihe City!\u201dXiao Yuhe laughed and asked, \u201cBy the way, Chief Instructor Dong, the training isn\u2019t over yet. Why is Lu Sheng back early?\u201dWhen Old Man Xia heard this, he immediately pricked up his ears.Then, he heard Dong Qingxue reply calmly, \u201cOh, it\u2019s like this. A month ago, we decided that Lu Sheng would represent the Dongning Province\u2019s Prodigy Training Camp to participate in the Qiming General Selection of the entire Eastern Province.\u201cHe\u2019s considered the strongest genius in this training camp, so this training is considered to have ended early for him. All he needs to do now is to prepare for the Qiming General Selection \u2026\u201dXiao Yuhe and Old Man Xia could no longer hear Dong Qingxue\u2019s words. It was as if someone had taken a gong and beat it hard in their ears.Buzz, buzz, buzz!Only a few words echoed in their minds.Qiming General Selection \u2026 Recognized as the strongest \u2026Xiao Yuhe suddenly turned to look at Lu Sheng. The look in his eyes had completely changed. He had already thought that Lu Sheng was a genius and outstanding enough, but he didn\u2019t expect that he had still underestimated him.Of course, Xiao Yuhe knew what the Qiming General Selection was. Compared to this event, the Prodigy Training Camp was nothing!It was a grand event that only the top geniuses in the entire Eastern Region were qualified to participate. Only one person from each province was qualified to participate.There were only a few dozen people in the entire Eastern Region.As for Lu Sheng, he was the only one in the entire Dongning Province!Most importantly, this was something that had been confirmed a month ago.What did this mean?This meant that Lu Sheng had already beaten the entire Prodigy Training Camp into submission a month ago. He had directly gotten the Chief Instructor to confirm his candidancy.Just how great was the gap in strength and talent between them to be able to confirm the situation so early? At that moment, Xiao Yuhe felt like he was drinking a glass of hundred-year-old iced wine on a hot summer day.His old face quickly flushed with excitement, but he felt extremely refreshed from the inside out.\u201cAlright, Instructor Dong. I will definitely supervise Lu Sheng\u2019s cultivation during this period of time and strive to get him a good ranking in the Qiming General Selection. He won\u2019t embarrass the entire Dongning Province!\u201dXiao Yuhe said all those words in a single breath. He was too excited.His every movement seemed to carry the wind. He was in indescribable good mood and high spirits!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 \u2013 You\u2019re a Spiritual Master. Why Did You Hide Such a Big Thing From Me?!He looked at Old Man Xia again.At this moment, Old Man Xia was completely frozen. His mouth was unnaturally open, and his expression was one of shock and astonishment.Although Old Man Xia did not know what the Qiming General Selection was, he could hear the weight behind Dong Qingxue\u2019s words.Representing Dongning Province \u2026 The entire Eastern Region \u2026Every single one of these words was a clear indication of Lu Sheng\u2019s position in the training camp and in Dong Qingxue\u2019s mind.Moreover, he clearly understood what Dong Qingxue was implying.Dongning Province\u2019s Prodigy Training Camp was specially established to select candidates for the Qiming General Selection. The candidate had been decided more than a month ago. The purpose of the training camp had been achieved long ago. It did not matter when it ended.That was the general gift behind her words.Old Man Xia was a little confused.At this moment, he heard Dong Qingxue\u2019s cold voice coming from the phone in Xiao Yuhe\u2019s hand. It sounded like she was reprimanding someone.\u201cXia Lin, get up. Can\u2019t you handle this little training? Do you still want to defeat Lu Sheng?!\u201d\u201cSob, sob. Instructor Dong, I don\u2019t want to defeat Lu Sheng at all. I would run whenever I saw him! I\u2019ll continue to run whenever I see him in the future \u2026 \u201d\u201cYou\u2019re driving me crazy, Xia Lin!\u201d The voice coming from through the phone was clear and audible. Old Man Xia\u2019s body trembled slightly.Alright.The monster in the training camp that his granddaughter had complained about in the video call \u2026 So it was this Lu Sheng!\u201cAlright, Instructor Dong, I won\u2019t disturb you anymore. I\u2019ll hang up first.\u201dXiao Yuhe, who was beaming with joy, was about to hang up the phone when Dong Qingxue suddenly called out to him.\u201cPresident Xiao, don\u2019t hang up first. I have a few words to say to Lu Sheng.\u201dXiao Yuhe was stunned, but he quickly understood.\u201cOh, oh, okay.\u201d Xiao Yuhe pointed the phone screen at Lu Sheng.Dong Qingxue\u2019s cold and beautiful face appeared before Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes. \u201cLu Sheng, I\u2019ve found almost all the materials you asked me to find for the Spiritual Master Weapon. I\u2019ve already sent you the list of names and prices. If you need me to buy anything for you, just let me know when the time comes \u2026\u201dXiao Yuhe, who was holding his phone, was beaming with joy as he gave Old Man Xia, who had a frighteningly dark expression, a smug and boastful look.In just a few minutes, the two men\u2019s expressions had completely changed.Even Xiao Yuhe himself could not help but sigh inwardly at the wonders of the world.However, the more Xiao Yuhe listened to Dong Qingxue\u2019s conversation with Lu Sheng, the more he felt that something was amiss. Old Man Xia also felt that something was wrong.The two of them exchanged glances and looked at the phone screen in Xiao Yuhe\u2019s hand at almost the same time.At this moment, Dong Qingxue spoke up.\u201cSpeaking of which, you still need to pass the spiritual master test as soon as possible. That way, you\u2019ll have the qualifications to log onto the Star Web and buy it yourself. That way, you won\u2019t have to trouble me every time. Well, that\u2019s all I have to say. Tell President Xiao that I\u2019m hanging up first. I\u2019m still busy here.\u201dBeep, beep, beep ~The video call ended.Xiao Yuhe and Old Man Xia looked as if they had seen a ghost.\u201cLu Sheng \u2026\u201d Xiao Yuhe forcefully swallowed his saliva and prepared to speak.The tone of his voice was slightly distorted, as if he was suppressing some kind of emotion.\u201cWhat did Instructor Dong Qingxue say to you just now?\u201d Xiao Yuhe\u2019s voice began to tremble a little.\u201cWhat did she mean by \u2026 telling you to hurry up and take the spiritual master test?\u201dAfter asking, Xiao Yuhe and Old Man Xia stared straight at Lu Sheng, anticipating his answer.Lu Sheng naturally replied, \u201cOh, because I was tested to have a talent for spiritual power in the training camp, Chief Instructor Dong Qingxue wrote me a recommendation letter and told me to take the spiritual master test when I have time. That\u2019s all.\u201dThat\u2019s all?What did he mean by that!Xiao Yuhe almost exploded. He almost jumped up on the spot.He had always admired Lu Sheng\u2019s calm and steady personality, but now he felt that Lu Sheng\u2019s behaviour was especially \u2026 asking for a beating!It was fine if he did not mention something as important as becoming a spiritual master, but why was he still so calm!Why do you make it sound like if Dong Qingxue had not let it slip, you wouldn\u2019t have mentioned it! You\u2019ve been hiding it from me, the president of the Martial Arts Association? Fuck, can you not just be nice!That was what he thought, but when it came to his mouth, only one sentence was left.\u201cGood, good, good \u2026 Lu Sheng, I was right about you. You are the top genius of our Baihe City in a hundred years!\u201dXiao Yuhe was so happy that his heart was trembling.A seventeen-year-old Level 3 Martial Artist with a combat power of 270,000. Most importantly, he had the talent to become a spiritual master.This was like having countless halos around him. It was so dazzling that it could not be more dazzling!In addition, Lu Sheng was about to represent Dongning Province in the Qiming General Selection. If he was selected, then damn \u2026 He, Xiao Yuhe, would completely soar!He might not even have to wait for Lu Sheng to grow. He could raise his status in the Martial Arts Association and obtain the opportunity to become a Grandmaster.Even if he did not become a General.With Lu Sheng\u2019s growth rate, as long as he had a good relationship with him, he would definitely benefit greatly in the future.Anyway, he was still young. It would take a few more years for his body\u2019s vitality to slowly decline. He could still afford to wait.Speaking of which, how should he get close to Lu Sheng?Right!Old Man Xia had a granddaughter. He was not as old as Old Man Xia, but he had nieces. Although his nieces were not very talented and did not look good, but \u2026 He should find a chance and give it a try.Sometimes, the tastes of monstrous geniuses were hard to predict. Who knew, he might find someone he liked.The more Xiao Yuhe thought about it, the more he liked Lu Sheng. A smile bloomed on his face. On the other hand, Old Man Xia\u2019s face was stiff. Even his lips were trembling.Lu Sheng was also a spiritual master. It seemed that he was even more talented than his granddaughter, Xia Lin.The last trace of pride in Old Man Xia\u2019s heart was completely shattered at this moment.\u2026\u201cYou really don\u2019t need me to send you home?\u201d Xiao Yuhe sent Lu Sheng all the way to the entrance of the Martial Arts Association and sent him to a taxi.\u201cNo need. I can go home by myself. Thank you, President Xiao.\u201d Lu Sheng politely rejected Xiao Yuhe\u2019s good intentions.Xiao Yuhe did not want to force him, but his expression was still filled with regret.\u201cThen come to my house for a meal when you are free. I will personally cook a few dishes for you to try. I will also introduce a few friends for you. They are about the same age as you. You should have common topics to talk about!\u201d\u201cDefinitely.\u201dThe taxi started. Xiao Yuhe waved at Lu Sheng and then turned around.His back immediately straightened, and the corners of his mouth curled up into a smile. His entire aura seemed to have changed.He could not wait to go back and call his old comrades, old buddies, and old colleagues to brag.He wanted to talk about how amazing a martial arts genius had appeared under the jurisdiction of his Martial Arts Association. He also wanted to talk about how black Old Man Xia\u2019s face was today \u2026Haha, just thinking about it made him feel good.Lu Sheng watched Xiao Yuhe leave through the window. He turned around and found the taxi driver looking at him curiously through the rearview mirror.Noticing his gaze, the driver could not help but ask, \u201cYoung man, who are you to President Xiao? Why is he so polite to you?\u201dLu Sheng smiled and said, \u201cNobody. I just know him. President Xiao has always been very polite to people.\u201d\u201cIs that so? That\u2019s rare. President Xiao is a Level 6 Martial Artist. I didn\u2019t expect him to have such a good temper in private. Young man, you look a little familiar \u2026\u201dThe taxi driver stared at Lu Sheng for a while. Suddenly, he slapped his thigh and almost threw the steering wheel out.\u201cI recognize you. You are Lu Sheng, right? The martial arts genius that was reported on the news two months ago! No wonder President Xiao is so polite to you. I heard that you are only in your third year of high school, and you are already a Level 3 Martial Artist \u2026\u201d\u201cGood boy, my daughter adores you. Can you give me an autograph later? I don\u2019t want to charge you \u2026\u201dHearing the taxi driver\u2019s endless chatter, Lu Sheng felt helpless.Are all taxi drivers in the world so talkative?Fortunately, it was not a long journey. Soon, he would reach his neighbourhood.\u201c\u2026 Speaking of which, do you have any unique martial arts skills? Can you teach me a few? I will teach my daughter when I get back \u2026\u201d The taxi driver was still talking to himself when he suddenly heard Lu Sheng whisper.\u201cSir, please stop the car first.\u201dThis voice was not loud, but it exploded in the driver\u2019s ears like thunder. The driver shuddered and slammed on the brakes. He turned around and looked at Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng was looking out the window. It was a rather stylish shop. The door was open, and half of the glass door was on the ground. Broken glass shards were everywhere.There was also a smashed signboard on the ground in front of the door. A few words could be faintly seen on the signboard \u2014 Red River Martial Arts Academy. Many people were standing far away to watch the show. Lu Sheng threw down a hundred yuan and got out of the car.\u201cLet\u2019s stop here. Thank you, sir.\u201dThe taxi driver blankly grabbed the hundred yuan. All of a sudden, he remembered something and hurriedly yelled.\u201cAutograph, you haven\u2019t given me your autograph yet.\u201dUnfortunately, Lu Sheng, who was dragging his suitcase, was already far away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 \u2014 Challenging the Academy\u201cWhy are there fights every day in this academy?\u201d\u201cWho says they aren\u2019t? People are injured every day, and people are sent to the hospital every day. The fighting is too fierce!\u201d\u201cWho would dare to send their children here \u2026\u201d\u201cIf these martial artists have the ability to fight their own people, why don\u2019t they go to the battlefield and fight foreign beasts instead of disturbing the people here \u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right \u2026\u201dA few aunties in their forties and fifties were holding vegetable baskets in their hands. They were standing not far from the door of the martial arts academy and discussing in low voices.Suddenly, a voice interrupted them.\u201cAunty, is this how this academy like, recently?\u201dThe aunties looked up and saw a tall, fair-skinned young man standing in front of them. The young man looked clean and handsome. He was dragging a suitcase in his hand, as if he had just returned from a trip. His pitch-black eyes were clear and deep, sparkling like crystals.The aunties were stunned for a moment and subconsciously replied, \u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s been like this since half a month ago. There are people coming to challenge the academy every day, batch after batch. Both sides have injured many people. I heard that even the master of the academy was injured \u2026\u201dThe handsome young man frowned and asked, \u201cDo you know why?\u201dOne of the aunties quickly said, \u201cI know this. It seems that this academy borrowed the name of a martial arts genius to recruit many students and steal the business of other academies.\u201cThe other academies couldn\u2019t stand it and joined forces to deal with it. I estimate that it will collapse in a few days. The signboard has been broken several times in the past half a month. Hey, what\u2019s the name of that martial arts genius? It seems that he lives in a neighbourhood nearby \u2026 \u201dThe aunties next to them couldn\u2019t help but interrupt, \u201cYoung man, don\u2019t tell me you want to sign up for this martial arts academy. Listen to aunty\u2019s advice, it\u2019s better if you go to some other academy. This place is a troublesome place. Don\u2019t get involved \u2026\u201dThe young man smiled and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m just going to the academy to find someone.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s good. But you\u2019d better come another day, or wait for a while. Wait for them to finish fighting before you go in \u2026 Hey, where is he?\u201dThe aunty was halfway through her words when she looked up and found that the young man standing in front of her had disappeared.Not far from the entrance of the academy, a suitcase could be seen being slowly pulled in.\u201cYoung people just don\u2019t like to listen to their elders. They\u2019re clearly in a fire pit, yet they still want to jump in. They\u2019ll suffer sooner or later.\u201dAt this time, one of the aunties suddenly shouted as she stared in the direction the young man went.\u201cAh! I remember now. Isn\u2019t this kid the high school martial arts genius that was reported on the TV news more than two months ago? I remember that it was this fair and clean appearance! These academies are fighting all because of him!\u201dThe other aunties were shocked. Only then did they realize that they had accidentally come into contact with the person at the centre of the incident.\u2026Lu Sheng dragged his suitcase and stepped through the gate of Red River Martial Arts Academy.The situation inside the door was even worse than what could be seen from the outside.There was a large group of people in the hall of the academy, and it seemed that there was a confrontation between two parties.\u2026Lu Sheng put down the suitcase and slowly walked towards the crowd. Everyone was looking at the center of the crowd. No one noticed him coming in.Lu Sheng went behind the crowd and patted the shoulder of a beautiful girl who was looking around on tiptoe. The girl turned around and was stunned when she saw Lu Sheng.Then she was surprised and excited. She turned around and was about to call for help. But before she could call out, her mouth was covered by a fair and slender hand.\u201cShh!\u201d Lu Sheng made a shushing gesture to the girl and shook his head slightly. He wanted her to keep quiet.The girl nodded obediently.Lu Sheng let go of her hand and looked at the center of the crowd.The beautiful girl who recognized him was the receptionist of the Red River Martial Arts Academy.\u2026Two groups stood in the academy\u2019s lobby. Some of the equipment and furniture in the lobby were pushed to the side.One of them was wearing a red martial arts suit with the word \u201cChuan\u201d printed on the back.This group of people stood in the middle of the lobby. There was a chair in front of them. A middle-aged man with a square face and a dignified appearance sat on the chair.Judging from his appearance and aura, he should be the real master of the Red River Martial Arts Academy, Ni Hongchuan. He was a Level 4 Martial Artist who had been famous in Baihe City for a long time.However, Ni Hongchuan seemed to be seriously injured. His face and lips were slightly pale. From time to time, he would reach out to cover his chest.Beside Ni Hongchuan stood a man and a woman. One of them was Ni Shuang, whom Lu Sheng recognized. The other was a short and skinny young man, whom he had never seen before.There were not many people in the Academy. Almost everyone had some injuries. Some had bruises on their faces. Some even had their hands or feet wrapped in plaster and bandages.They looked like old and weak soldiers. Their aura was much weaker than the group of people wearing dark blue martial arts suits.\u201cLin Tieshan, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re going overboard? Our Red River Martial Arts Academy has promised not to recruit any more students for a year. What more do you want?\u201dNi Hongchuan stared at a man wearing a black martial arts suit and spoke in a deep voice.The man wearing the black martial arts suit was close to two meters tall. He had a crew cut and dark skin. The muscles on his body were like blocks of rock. His appearance was fierce and his eyes were sharp. He was like a fierce black tiger, looking around with an imposing aura.The man wearing the dark martial arts suit seemed to be the leader of the group.When he heard Ni Hongchuan\u2019s words, he grinned, revealing a row of neat white teeth. \u201cMaster Ni, today we won\u2019t talk about business. We, the Iron Mountain Academy, are here to seek guidance from your Red River Academy.\u201d\u201cLin Tieshan, you\u2019re a Level 4 Martial Artist. You\u2019re taking advantage of my father\u2019s injury to challenge us. Don\u2019t you have any shame?\u201d Before Ni Hongchuan could speak, Ni Shuang was already reprimanding him.Lin Tieshan laughed and said, \u201cNiece Ni\u2019s words are fascinating. Do martial artists need to look at the day to challenge another martial arts school? Your father, Ni Hongchuan, being injured is his problem. Me coming to challenge a school is my problem. Since your Red River Academy dares to put up your signboard, you should be prepared to be smashed at any time!\u201dAs he spoke, Lin Tieshan released his aura. The group of people from the Red River Academy had a slight change in expression as they took a few steps back.Ni Hongchuan\u2019s face was calm as water. He slowly nodded and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right. Since we put up our signboard, we must have the ability to protect it. I, Ni Hongchuan, came to Baihe City twenty years ago. I was alone and relied on my fists to build my foundation. I could do it then, and I can do it now.\u201dNi Hongchuan abruptly stood up, an unnatural flush quickly appearing on his face. He was already injured. His actions had affected his injuries and he coughed violently.\u201cDad!\u201d\u201cMaster!\u201dNi Shuang and the short and skinny youth saw this and quickly reached out to support him. They were extremely worried.\u201cI\u2019m fine \u2026\u201d Ni Hongchuan reached out to block their hands and shook his head to indicate that he was fine.Lin Tieshan on the side laughed and coldly said, \u201cSince you don\u2019t have the ability, don\u2019t brag so much. A seventeen-year-old Level 2 Martial Artist \u2026 Heh, is that a student that you, Ni Hongchuan, can teach? It serves you right to be crippled.\u201d\u201cI already said, Lu Sheng is not my dad\u2019s student. He\u2019s just a member here!\u201d Ni Shuang tried to explain.Lin Tieshan waved his hand and said indifferently, \u201cI don\u2019t care about this. I only know that you guys used the name of Lu Sheng to steal more than half of our school\u2019s business. If you dare to stretch your claws into our pockets, don\u2019t blame us for chopping off your claws.\u201d\u201cThe student cancelled his card and wanted to come to us. Who can you blame?\u201d\u201cI know. That\u2019s why we decided to tear down your Red River Academy\u2019s signboard. If your school falls, the students will have nowhere to go. Naturally, they will come back.\u201d\u201cYou \u2026\u201d Ni Shuang was so angry that she gritted her teeth. She couldn\u2019t say a word.Lin Tieshan clapped his hands and said, \u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough nonsense. Hurry up and send people up. I\u2019ll take care of them. Go to the Martial Arts Association and cancel your school \u2026\u201dRed River Academy\u2019s people were filled with grief and indignation. Since half a month, there were people coming to challenge the academy almost every day.At first, it was still okay. Everyone could still handle it.But later on, it became more and more intense. Other masters personally brought people up.Ni Hongchuan personally fought a few rounds. He was also seriously injured and almost couldn\u2019t fight any more.Now, there was another Level 4 Martial Artist school master coming to challenge them. Red River Academy might really be forced to close down at this rate.\u201cI\u2019ll fight you!\u201d Ni Shuang gritted her teeth and walked out.Ni Hongchuan\u2019s face changed. He hurriedly said, \u201cNi Shuang, come back. You\u2019re only Level 3. You\u2019re no match for him.\u201dNi Shuang shook her head and said with a firm face, \u201cDad, this is all my fault. I should take responsibility. Don\u2019t worry. At worst, I\u2019ll just be injured. He won\u2019t dare to kill me.\u201d\u201cJunior Sister, I\u2019ll fight with you.\u201d The short and thin youth standing on the other side of Ni Hongchuan also stood up.Although the youth\u2019s appearance was not impressive, he was quite calm. He looked at Lin Tieshan and said, \u201cSchool Master Lin, you\u2019re a Level 4 Martial Artist. Bullying my Junior Sister, who\u2019s a Level 3, isn\u2019t that unreasonable?\u201dLin Tieshan smiled and nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Red River Academy can send as many people as you want. I\u2019ll take them all on.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 \u2014 How Are You Going to Teach Me? By Kneeling?\u201cIf we work together, we might have a chance.\u201d Ni Shuang saw that Lin Tieshan had agreed, and her face lit up. Ni Hongchuan smiled bitterly and shook his head.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a chance. Lin Tieshan\u2019s skills are not something to be taken lightly, and he\u2019s also a Level 4 Martial Artist. Even when I wasn\u2019t injured, I was only on par with him. Not to mention you guys \u2026\u201d\u201cDad, you\u2019re underestimating me and Senior Brother. I might be a little weak, but Senior Brother is still a top student of Dongning Martial Arts University. If we work together, we won\u2019t be afraid of Lin Tieshan.\u201d Ni Shuang said confidently.The short and skinny young man beside her also said in a low voice, \u201cMaster, Junior Sister is right. If we don\u2019t fight, who knows if we\u2019ll have a chance. Besides \u2026\u201d The young man stretched out his hands to Ni Hongchuan.Ni Hongchuan was stunned for a moment, then his face lit up with surprise. He said urgently, \u201cYou broke through?\u201dThe young man shook his head and said, \u201cI\u2019m still a bit away from cultivating internal strength, but my BQV has reached 200.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean you\u2019re half a step into Level 4?\u201d Ni Shuang was overjoyed.Ni Hongchuan was also quite excited. \u201cGood. I was wondering why you\u2019d be so impulsive with Ni Shuang today since you\u2019ve always been calm. Turns out you\u2019re confident.\u201d\u201cDad!\u201d Ni Shuang frowned.\u201cHaha \u2026\u201d Ni Hongchuan laughed, and most of the depression on his face disappeared. Even his injuries seemed to have healed.\u201cI say, how long are you guys going to continue talking?\u201d Lin Tieshan\u2019s voice sounded. \u201cIf we delay any longer, the martial arts association will close down! Do we have to make another trip tomorrow?\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d Ni Shuang glared at him and said coldly, \u201cI\u2019ll beat you up later. I want you to carry our Red River Martial Arts Academy\u2019s signboard and parade through the streets!\u201dLin Tieshan smiled slightly, and a cold light shot out from his eyes.\u201cWhat a sharp-tongued little girl. How annoying \u2026\u201dIn the next second, Lin Tieshan\u2019s figure suddenly disappeared.Ni Shuang\u2019s heart skipped a beat, and then she heard the short and skinny young man\u2019s voice.\u201cJunior Sister, be careful.\u201dThen, two figures collided violently \u2026 A figure suddenly retreated seven or eight meters, revealing the short and skinny youth\u2019s slightly pale face.Ni Shuang hurriedly ran over and anxiously asked, \u201cAre you alright?\u201dOnly then did she realize that it was the short and skinny young man who had blocked Lin Tieshan\u2019s attack for her.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m fine.\u201d The short and thin young man squeezed out a smile and shook his head.Ni Shuang did not notice that the short and skinny young man\u2019s right hand, which he had hidden behind his back, was constantly trembling.Ni Hongchuan, who witnessed this scene, had a solemn expression on his face. His brows slowly furrowed.\u201cSo you were hiding something like this.\u201d Lin Tieshan glanced at the short and thin youth, and revealed a surprised expression. \u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019ll cripple them as well, so that they won\u2019t come seeking revenge in the future. It\u2019s so annoying.\u201dLin Tieshan took a step forward. In an instant, his entire body seemed to have expanded slightly. His muscles were bulging, and his skin had a faint metallic luster. A mountain-like aura pressed down on the short and skinny young man and Ni Shuang.Their expressions changed drastically.The current Lin Tieshan was different from the previous Lin Tieshan.It was almost as if \u2026 he was a completely different person!Ni Hongchuan abruptly stood up from his chair, his face full of shock.\u201cLin Tieshan, you\u2019ve reached Level 5?\u201dLin Tieshan grinned. \u201cAlmost, but my Iron Mountain Force has already reached Great Mastery. Ni Hongchuan, you coward. You don\u2019t dare to compete yourself, so you sent two kids to die. Then I\u2019ll fulfill your wish!\u201dAs he spoke, Lin Tieshan struck out with both hands.His two pitch-black fleshy palms were like cattail leaf fans, and were several times larger than an ordinary person\u2019s. They whistled through the air, and even scraped the curtains a few meters away. The aura was terrifying to the extreme.Ni Hongchuan was shocked and angry. He wanted to open his mouth to stop it, but it exacerbated his injuries. His face paled, and he suddenly collapsed on the chair.Ni Shuang and the short and skinny young man were enveloped by this aura. Their faces were pale, but they could only grit their teeth and endure.Crack!With a crisp sound, the short and skinny young man screamed as he flew backward and crashed to the ground.One of his arms was bent at an odd angle. His face was covered in cold sweat from the pain, and his lips were trembling.Ni Shuang was slightly better.Most of Lin Tieshan\u2019s strength was used on the short and skinny young man. Her arm was only scraped by the edge of the iron palm, but it was still dislocated.It was just a face-off.The two Level 3 Martial Artists under Ni Hongchuan of the Red River Martial Arts Academy were both injured and collapsed on the ground, completely unable to fight.Lin Tieshan\u2019s strength was so terrifying that it made it difficult for everyone to breathe.\u201cAnyone else?\u201dLin Tieshan twisted his neck and smiled as he scanned the people of the Red River Martial Arts Academy. Anyone who was swept by his gaze lowered their head in fear. No one dared to look him in the eye.\u201cEnough \u2026\u201d Ni Hongchuan\u2019s chest rose and fell violently. He slowly stood up and said word by word, \u201cDon\u2019t you want the Red River Martial Arts Academy to close down? Fine, I\u2019ll do as you wish. Let\u2019s go to the Martial Arts Association to cancel the school\u2019s licence \u2026\u201dAfter saying this, Ni Hongchuan looked as if he had aged ten years in an instant. Even his back was bent.\u201cDad!\u201d Ni Shuang\u2019s eyes reddened. Her heart was filled with self-blame and guilt.Everyone in the Red River Martial Arts Academy was dejected and looked miserable.Lin Tieshan saw that he had achieved his goal. He smiled and said, \u201cI still believe in School Master Ni\u2019s character. Since that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll take my men back \u2026\u201d\u201cWait.\u201dAt this moment, a voice suddenly came from the crowd. Everyone was stunned and looked over subconsciously.They saw a well-proportioned, tall, and handsome young man with fair skin walking out.\u201cIf the school closes just like that, where am I going to train in the future?\u201dThe young man glanced at Ni Hongchuan and said indifferently. Ni Hongchuan was shocked and did not say anything.Ni Shuang recognized the young man at a glance and said in surprise, \u201cLu Sheng?!\u201dLu Sheng nodded at Ni Shuang.In an instant, everyone\u2019s eyes gathered on Lu Sheng with a strange look in their eyes.\u201cSo he\u2019s Lu Sheng!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the one who caused our school to fall to this state!\u201d\u201cShut up \u2026\u201dThe people of the Red River Martial Arts Academy were in an uproar. Many of them glared at Lu Sheng, as if they were blaming him for everything that had happened.Even Ni Hongchuan had a complicated look on his face after knowing that Lu Sheng was here.Lin Tieshan\u2019s eyes lit up. He looked at Lu Sheng and said, \u201cSo you\u2019re the one on the signboard? Not bad, not bad, you\u2019re really impressive and talented \u2026 Little Brother Lu, are you worried that you won\u2019t have a place to train after the school closes? Don\u2019t worry, our Iron Mountain Martial Arts School welcomes you at all times \u2026\u201dLin Tieshan pointed at Ni Hongchuan and the short and skinny young man on the ground. He smiled and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve seen it yourself. Red River Martial Arts Academy is full of trash. They can\u2019t even take one hit from me. What can this school teach you? Come to our Iron Mountain Martial Arts School. I can personally teach you the Iron Mountain Secret Technique. I won\u2019t hide anything \u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After mastering it, you\u2019ll be invincible. I\u2019m not bragging \u2026\u201dLin Tieshan patted his chest and boasted confidently, \u201cWithin the same level, there aren\u2019t many who can break my defence. Ni Hongchuan can\u2019t, and no one else can.\u201dNi Hongchuan\u2019s face turned a bit hideous at those words, but he couldn\u2019t refute.Just now Lin Tieshan had demonstrated his strength. His defence was like iron, and his momentum was like a mountain. He really wasn\u2019t a match for him right now.\u201cYou\u2019re willing to teach me such a powerful technique?\u201d \u00a0Lu Sheng said lightly.Lin Tieshan felt that Lu Sheng was a bit tempted. The smile on his face deepened. He quickly said, \u201cOf course I\u2019m willing. As long as you join our Iron Mountain Martial Arts School and take me as your teacher, I\u2019ll teach you everything I know.\u201dLu Sheng took two steps forward and looked at Lin Tieshan calmly. He casually said, \u201cThen how are you going to teach me?\u201dLin Tieshan frowned. Why does this kid have so many questions? But considering the other party\u2019s identity, he still patiently said, \u201cIf you come, I\u2019ll \u2026\u201dLin Tieshan didn\u2019t finish his words.Suddenly.Lu Sheng suddenly disappeared in front of him.Immediately after, a terrifying aura, like a volcanic eruption, swept out in all directions.Lin Tieshan\u2019s scalp instantly went numb. All the hairs on his body stood on end. A great sense of life and death crisis crazily surged from the bottom of his heart.Bang!He roared. All the muscles on his body swelled and turned dark. His whole body suddenly swelled up, and then he fiercely pushed his palms forward.However, a white fleshy fist easily deflected his palms and went straight in, smashing into his chest as easily as crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood.Crack, crack, crack~The sound of bones breaking rang out.Boom!The terrifying power contained in the fist suddenly exploded. Lin Tieshan\u2019s mountain-like body flew out with a swoosh.Smashing through the crowd, he flew all the way to the side of the entrance of the Martial Arts Academy.Boom!He smashed on a wall, deeply embedding himself on it.\u201cTap, tap, tap \u2026\u201d The crisp sound of footsteps echoed in the quiet hall.Lu Sheng walked over step by step. His posture casual, his expression was indifferent. He stopped in front of Lin Tieshan, whose face was filled with pain, shock, and fear. He looked down at him and said lightly.\u201cHow are you going to teach me, by kneeling?\u201dThere was a deathly silence covering the entire Martial Arts Academy.Everyone stared blankly at the scene in front of them. They were in a trance, as if they were dreaming.Ni Shuang\u2019s beautiful eyes were wide open. Her mouth was so wide that a duck egg could be stuffed into it.Even Ni Hongchuan was shocked. He sat on the chair and gripped the armrest tightly.It was as if this was the only way he could prevent himself from falling to the ground.Lin Tieshan \u2026 lost!A Level 4 Martial Artist who had mastered defensive martial arts.Lin Tieshan, who was insufferably arrogant and tyrannical, was like a demon king.He was punched by Lu Sheng \u2026He was blasted into the wall!The strong defence he was so proud of was as fragile as a piece of paper in front of Lu Sheng. It could not even block one punch from Lu Sheng and was broken.Everyone looked at the ground.On the floor of the academy, there was a clear drag mark that was more than twenty meters long. It was the trace of Lin Tieshan being punched by Lu Sheng.It was terrifying.It was simply impossible to imagine how such a terrifying punch could be unleashed! The most important thing was that Lu Sheng had made this punch.To be able to defeat Lin Tieshan who was at the peak of Level 4 so easily, one had to be a Level 5 Martial Artist.Seventeen years old, high school student, Level 5 Martial Artist \u2026When these words were put together, everyone felt their scalp go numb. Their bodies could not help but tremble violently.It was not because of fear.It was a convulsive reaction caused by the brain stimulating the body after being shocked too much.\u201cIt seems that the Iron Mountain Secret Technique that you bragged about is not that great after all \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng shook his head and stopped looking at Lin Tieshan.Behind him, Lin Tieshan\u2019s dark face was almost distorted. But more than that, he was deeply shocked and terrified.This kid \u2026This kid \u2026He was simply a monster!Lu Sheng picked up the suitcase that was just placed at the entrance of the hall and said to Ni Hongchuan, \u201cDon\u2019t let the martial arts school close. Otherwise, it\u2019ll be a bit troublesome to find one \u2026 so close to home.\u201dNi Hongchuan stood up from the chair. His face was full of excitement.\u201cOf course, of course \u2026\u201dLu Sheng ignored him. He dragged the suitcase and turned to leave.Behind him, everyone looked at him with awe and shock.\u2026Lu Sheng did not have any special feelings for the Red River Martial Arts Academy. It was mainly because he had received the sponsorship fee from Ni Shuang. It was not much, just two hundred thousand yuan.But after all, he was the one who had caused the other party to be in such a miserable state. But it would only happen once.If the Red River Martial Arts Academy were to encounter similar incidents in the future, Lu Sheng would not interfere.He could protect them once, but he couldn\u2019t protect them forever.In this world, martial arts still reigned supreme.If he wasn\u2019t strong enough and wasn\u2019t able to protect some things, he wouldn\u2019t be able to blame others for taking them away.Unknowingly, he had already arrived at the door of his house.When he opened the door, the aroma of meat and coriander wafted out.His mother, Zheng Yufen, heard the door open and walked out of the kitchen. When she saw Lu Sheng, she hurried over to help him carry his luggage.\u201cWhy are you so late? Didn\u2019t you say that you would arrive in the morning? I cooked a whole table of dishes for lunch, but no one helped me finish it \u2026\u201dLu Sheng had called home before he came back.\u201cOh, I went to the Martial Arts Association to look for President Xiao. On the way back, I saw a group of people bullying a few old and weak people, so I decided to help them. Sorry for the delay \u2026\u201dLu Sheng explained apologetically.When Zheng Yufen heard this, her expression immediately changed. She stared at Lu Sheng from head to toe, sizing him up.\u201cDid you fight with someone? Were you hurt? Let me take a good look \u2026\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t hurt. Mom, you underestimate me too much. In any case, I\u2019m an official martial artist now. I even went to the training camp and became even stronger. How could a few hooligans hurt me?\u201dLu Sheng lifted the luggage with one finger and moved it up and down with ease, showing that he was very strong now.\u201cAs if! No matter how strong you are, you\u2019re still just a high school student. There are plenty of people out there who are stronger than you. Don\u2019t try to be brave in the future, okay?\u201dZheng Yufen nagged for a bit, then reached out and pinched Lu Sheng\u2019s arm. Satisfied, she said: \u201cYou do seem a lot stronger.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They haven\u2019t come back yet.\u201dLu Sheng frowned and said: \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that Dad wouldn\u2019t be a porter any more? His body can\u2019t can take any more work. When he turns old, he\u2019ll be covered in injuries \u2026\u201d\u201cIf he\u2019s not a porter, what else can he do?\u201d Zheng Yufen comforted: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll keep an eye on him for you. Ever since he ate the meat you sent back last time, your father\u2019s health has improved a lot.\u201dLu Sheng nodded, and his expression relaxed a little. \u00a0Relying on the fact that Dong Qingxue and Qin Shaojun were taking care of him in the training camp, Lu Sheng specially sent back some of the exotic beast meat that the trainees ate.It wasn\u2019t much, just a few dozen pounds. It was enough for the family to eat for a long time.The nutritional value of exotic beast meat was dozens or even hundreds of times that of ordinary beef and mutton. It was much better than some of the health supplements on the market.\u201cHow\u2019s Qinghe\u2019s performance recently?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s improved a lot. She\u2019s filled with vitality.\u201dLu Sheng casually asked his mother about the situation at home, then went into the room to put down the luggage and took a shower.In the evening, Lu Dahai and Lu Qinghe came back one after another.Because of Lu Sheng\u2019s return, the small family was once again complete. The whole family was quite happy. Lu Dahai even had a few drinks during dinner.When he heard that Lu Sheng had taught a few hooligans a lesson on the way back, Lu Dahai was so happy that his face was flushed red.\u201cMartial artists should be like this. When you see injustice on the road, get rid of the strong and help the weak. When you need to do something, do something \u2026 Otherwise, what\u2019s the point of practising martial arts? Just find an office building and work.\u201dZheng Yufen scolded him. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who you are after a few drinks. What if your son gets hurt? You won\u2019t feel bad for him, would you?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a boy. What\u2019s the big deal if he gets hurt and bleeds a little? My son will go to the battlefield to kill foreign beasts and protect the country in the future \u2026\u201dLu Dahai tapped the wine glass with his chopsticks, shook his head, and started singing a song.\u201c~Waiting to be the commander, putting on the armor and going to war \u2026~\u201dLu Sheng looked at this scene, and his eyes gradually softened. He had a big heart, and there were many things that he wanted to do. But for now, this family was all that he wanted to protect.He turned his head and found Lu Qinghe secretly looking at him.Lu Qinghe stuffed a mouthful of rice into her mouth. She shyly said in a low voice, \u201cBrother, how was your training camp?\u201dLu Sheng smiled and said softly, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. The instructor took good care of me \u2026\u201d\u201cWas it hard?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t hard.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the daily training routine like?\u201d\u2026The night was cold as winter.Lu Sheng sat quietly on the yoga mat in the middle of the room.Spiritual power slowly flowed in his mind, bringing with it a cool feeling. Soon, Lu Sheng entered the dream.On the ruined street, Lu Sheng\u2019s figure quietly appeared. Lu Sheng\u2019s face was calm as he strolled on the desolate street.He began to walk in the direction of the city centre.Entering the next street.One after another, wandering figures appeared in front of Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng\u2019s expression was calm. The powerful spiritual power of a Level 3 Spiritual Master seeped out of his body.The zombies that tried to get close to him were instantly flung away, like straws being uprooted by a tornado. One by one, the zombies were weathered in the air, turning into black smoke and returning to Lu Sheng.As the zombies along the street were cleared, the black smoke also increased in number. The speed of absorption couldn\u2019t keep up with the production.The black smoke gathered behind Lu Sheng, like a black cloak full of scars.Boom!A zombie was flung away by the spiritual power, but in the blink of an eye it shot back at an even faster speed.Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes were as bright as the morning stars.His feet stomped heavily on the ground, and his whole body leaped high into the air. Lu Sheng raised his right fist in the air, his breath as hot as fire.\u201cHeroic Spirit Immortal!\u201dHis fair, fleshy fist smashed down and smashed into the zombie\u2019s body as if it was breaking rotten wood. The tall zombie roared and exploded into a cloud of dust. A thick black smoke was sent out.\u201cLevel 6 Martial Artist!\u201dAfter destroying the zombie blocking his way with one punch, Lu Sheng\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change as he continued to move forward.With his current strength, he only needed one punch to take care of a zombie that was a Level 6 Martial Artist before its death.Lu Sheng kept moving forward, gradually going deeper into the city. Along the way, he killed at least hundreds of zombies.The memory fragments of these zombies gathered together, filling Lu Sheng\u2019s mind. It made his head ache, and his heart constantly had the urge to vent.The desire to destroy everything.Lu Sheng knew that this was the after-effect of absorbing too many battle memories in one go. All he needed to do was sit down and practice Crystal Contemplation for a while, and this after-effect would immediately disappear.But.Lu Sheng didn\u2019t want to think about it yet.He was looking for something.Boom!Suddenly, a thin figure landed in front of Lu Sheng.Large cracks appeared on the hard street under the figure\u2019s feet.Lu Sheng\u2019s pupils contracted, and he stopped abruptly.Lu Sheng looked at the uninvited guest in front of him who was attracted by him, rubbed his swollen temples, and grinned. He had found what he was looking for.Why didn\u2019t he choose to clear the complicated memories in his mind?Because he was afraid.He was afraid that without the desire to fight and destroy that was born from \u201cQi Deviation.\u201dHe would lose \u2026 The courage to fight with the Master level zombie in front of him![TN Note: Still in the midst of finalizing a few terms. In the interim, \u201cMaster\u201d will refer to a Level 7 Martial Artist, and Level 8 a \u201cGrandmaster\u201d. Hope this doesn\u2019t cause much confusion. I will resolve it soon. You can leave comments if you need further clarifications on the terms used. Also, I will publish a list of terms once I find it relevant. Till then, thanks for your continued support. Ciao!]Lu Sheng narrowed his eyes and sized up the zombie in front of him. It was about 1.75 meters tall and lean, possessing of a mesomorphic figure.It looked unordinary, wearing rather exquisite streamlined battle armour.This zombie looked very similar to an ordinary middle-aged man in his forties. If one did not look at its unfocused eyes and dead gray skin, it was almost no different from a normal person.The mighty force of time seemed to have washed away some of the moisture in its body, making it shrivelled and covered with dust.Compared to the rotten and broken zombies that Lu Sheng had seen before, this zombie was particularly \u201cfresh\u201d and \u201ccomplete.\u201d\u201cA Master\u2019s blood is as thick as mercury, and the body as hard as steel. It is not something that a Level 6 Martial Artist or below can compare to. It\u2019s simply too powerful \u2026\u201dAnd it was such a powerful Master zombie that there was a large hole with a diameter of more than 10 centimetres where its heart should\u2019ve been. Yet it was empty, and one could see right through it.It was hard to imagine what kind of terrifying beast was able to dig out the heart of a Master in one go during the battle that destroyed the base.The Master zombie was standing at a distance, quietly looking at him, as if waiting for something.\u201cLet\u2019s fight!\u201dLu Sheng took a deep breath, and the rhythm of his breathing quietly changed.\u201cBreath of the Wind!\u201dA faint wind lingered around Lu Sheng\u2019s body. Lu Sheng\u2019s body swayed, and in an instant, he disappeared from where he was.Using the full power begotten from Intricate realm, he was astonishingly fast, like a wisp of smoke. In a few breaths, he was in front of the zombie.The Master zombie did not seem to notice and was still standing in the same spot. Lu Sheng viciously kicked the Master zombie\u2019s head.Driven by the powerful vitality of a Level 3 Martial Artist, this kick was like a steel blade, tearing through the air and making a sharp whistling sound.BAM!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Master zombie was still standing in the same spot, but its right hand had raised at some point.Its palm was in a natural state, gently blocking the side of its face.But it was this casual gesture that was akin to \u201crasing one\u2019s had to speak in class\u201d that blocked Lu Sheng\u2019s powerful kick.Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes were filled with shock.He felt as if his leg had kicked an incomparably thick cushion, and all of his strength had been absorbed and dissolved completely.The enormous strength contained in his leg fell into the palm of the zombie at the Master level, but it was like a clay ox entering the sea, without the slightest ripple.Lu Sheng jumped back immediately, his expressions morose.\u201cAlthough I didn\u2019t use all my strength in that kick, I still used six times the strength of a star and the bonus of a Perfection Realm Footwork. My CPI should be above 100,000, but I couldn\u2019t even move one of its fingers. Master zombies are indeed terrifying!\u201dMoreover, this was only a Master who only had battle instincts left. If it was a true Master Martial Artist \u2026 Someone like that would have been unimaginably strong.After this test, Lu Sheng no longer held back.Ten times the power of a star, Perfection Realm Fist Technique, Breath of Flames \u2026Other than not using the Blood Qi boost from the Divine Illumination Meditation Scripture, he had used almost all of his strength.But no matter what kind of attack he made, the zombie in front of him could always block it easily.Lu Sheng faintly had an illusion. Like what he was facing now was not an ordinary person who was only about 1.7 meters tall.Instead, it was a wall, a mountain.It could not be broken, and it could not be overcome.\u201cHuff, huff \u2026\u201dLu Sheng stood dozens of meters away from the Master zombie, breathing heavily with a somewhat sombre expression.\u201cThere is no way to defeat it at all, and I can\u2019t even hurt it \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng felt that there seemed to be an invisible membrane outside the body of the zombie.All of his attacks hit this membrane, and 99% of his strength was directly negated.As a result, although Lu Sheng\u2019s combat power was now as high as hundreds of thousands, he couldn\u2019t even make the zombie take a step back.\u201cThis should be \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng took a deep breath and slowly spat out a word. \u201cMaster Force Field!\u201d\u201cIt is rumoured that Masters have invisible force fields that even bullets can\u2019t penetrate. After being shot into the force field, it will be directly stopped and blocked, completely turning into useless scrap iron. Seeing it today, it really lives up to its reputation \u2026\u201d\u201cThis is the weak force field left outside the body of the dead Master. If it was a real Master at his peak, I probably wouldn\u2019t even be able to get close to him, let alone attack him \u2026\u201dThe strength of the Master Force Field was beyond Lu Sheng\u2019s expectations, and he was almost at his wit\u2019s end.Now he understood why there was only one level difference between a Level 6 and Level 7 Martial Artists, but the difference in status was like heaven and earth. Level 7 could be called a Master, but level six could only be a Martial Artist.It was because the gap between the two was too big. It was a qualitative difference, a difference in their being.Reaching Level 7 Master realm could almost be regarded as a evolution in the life form.\u201cHowever, there is still good news. This zombie at the Master level didn\u2019t seem to regard me as an opponent at all, and it only passively resisted my attacks, never taking the initiative to attack. Otherwise, I would have been killed on the spot.\u201dLu Sheng now felt as if he had become a noob player that had mistakenly entered a high-level monster map.In the face of the huge level gap, even if the monsters in the high-level map stood still and let him attack, he couldn\u2019t break the other party\u2019s defence.\u201cI can\u2019t even forcibly deduct -1, -1 \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng was a little helpless. (*TL: referring to how a noob player cannot cause damage to a high level monster.)\u201cNo, it seems to be losing something!\u201dLu Sheng tried a few more times and unexpectedly found that the invisible force field outside the body of the zombie seemed to have weakened a little.Although it was very little, only a little, almost negligible. But it was definitely weakened.Lu Sheng had attacked nearly a thousand times, and he already knew the defensive ability of the zombie like the back of his hand.\u201cIf I grind it down bit by bit, I might have a chance, but I\u2019m afraid that when I grind it down below a point, it will go berserk all of a sudden \u2026\u201cAnd this is too slow, I estimate that I\u2019ll have to attack a million times to wear down its force field \u2026\u201dLu Sheng already felt like he was on the brink of exhausting his stamina.This was also because he had been using Natural Breathing to recover, if it were any other Level 3 Martial Artist, who knows how many times they would have collapsed from exhaustion.\u201cMaybe I should retreat first. I can deal with this old bone after I\u2019m strong enough?\u201d Lu Sheng had the intention to retreat. But he was also a little unwilling.A Level 6 zombies were almost useless to him in actual combat training, after his spiritual power reached Level 3, hunting zombies below Level 6 was like cutting grass, sweeping through a large area \u2026Wait!Lu Sheng suddenly thought of something.Spiritual power!Yes, spiritual power attack.He had never tried to use spiritual strength to attack.\u201cI haven\u2019t practised the real combat skills of a Spiritual Master, so I\u2019ve always used spiritual power as an auxiliary means, to fuel the Divine Illumination Meditation Scripture to increase my vitality. I almost forgot that I\u2019m still a Level 3 Spiritual Master.\u201cCompared to my strength in martial arts, I\u2019m more proficient in using my spiritual strength!\u201dThinking of this, Lu Sheng suddenly felt his vision clearing up in front of him. Although Lu Sheng hadn\u2019t learned the corresponding spiritual power combat skills, his spiritual power was strong enough.It was like Lu Sheng holding a piece of iron in his hand, although he hadn\u2019t learned how to forge this piece of iron into a sword to cut people, but when he swung the iron out, the power generated was still quite impressive.\u201cLet\u2019s try it!\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s eyes lit up, and the more he thought about it, the more he felt that this method was feasible.\u201cThere\u2019s another advantage to using spiritual power to attack. My spiritual power is replenished very quickly after consumption, because there are zombies everywhere, as long as I absorb some memories and use Crystal Contemplation to purify it, it will be fine. It\u2019s much faster than recovering physical strength.\u201dThinking of this, Lu Sheng immediately condensed his spiritual power into a ball, and fiercely hit the zombie in front of him.Just like physical attacks, the moment the spiritual power touched the zombies, it was like touching an invisible barrier.The spiritual power hit the barrier and disappeared. But at the same time, the invisible barrier was also partially consumed.\u201cThe effect is so much better than physical attacks!\u201d Lu Sheng was surprised and happy, and quickly understood after thinking about it.\u201cA Master Force Field is the external manifestation of a Master\u2019s Will, and a Master\u2019s Will is basically a Master\u2019s spiritual strength. Using spiritual power to consume spiritual power is naturally feasible. Sigh, I\u2019m too stupid, I should have thought of this.\u201dLu Sheng didn\u2019t delay any longer, and quickly manipulated his spiritual power to attack the zombie\u2019s force field again and again.The zombie\u2019s force field was quickly consumed, and the invisible barrier was quickly weakening and thinning at a speed that Lu Sheng\u2019s spiritual power could perceive.Lu Sheng\u2019s spiritual power was exhausted twice in the process, but fortunately, he had harvested a lot of ordinary zombies\u2019 memories before.Crystal Contemplation was slightly activated, and a steady stream of spiritual power emerged from it.In the process, Lu Sheng\u2019s martial arts improved again. More than 80% of his martial arts skills broke through a bottleneck, which was to say, they reached the Perfection Realm.This was a terrifying improvement for Lu Sheng\u2019s comprehensive combat ability.But Lu Sheng didn\u2019t have time to care about this now, and all his attention was on the zombie in front of him.He was really looking forward to it.What kind of martial arts treasures would there be in the memories of this Master zombie?!Boom!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The zombie\u2019s body shook slightly, but there was no fluctuation. Its appearance didn\u2019t seem to have changed at all.But in Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes, this Master-level zombie had become extremely \u201cdim.\u201dIt was like a light bulb that was gradually going out. Its outer shell didn\u2019t seem to have changed, but in fact, the tungsten filaments inside were rapidly dimming.Boom!It was another spiritual attack.As Lu Sheng continued to use his spiritual power, he became more skilled at using this simple and crude technique. And he could feel that his spiritual power attacks were getting stronger each time. This was because his spiritual power was quickly consumed and recovered using Crystal Contemplation Method.If Lu Sheng were to do another spiritual power test now, his spiritual power would definitely be far stronger than before.Meanwhile, the force field around the Master-level zombie was only left with a thin layer. It was as thin as a layer of window paper. It felt like it would break at any time.Boom!A strange light flashed in Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes. He didn\u2019t know how many times he had launched his spiritual power to attack.This time, the spiritual power attack fell on the body of the Master-level zombie and encountered a slight resistance. Then \u2026 It suddenly went through!\u201cIt\u2019s done!\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s figure disappeared in an instant.Breath of Wind.When he appeared again, he was already in front of the Master-level zombie. Lu Sheng felt that the Master-level zombie was much, much weaker than it was at the beginning.Divine Illumination Meditation Scripture increased his vitality (BQV) once again!Boom!Inside Lu Sheng\u2019s body, the two hearts were beating loudly, and his Qi and blood were roaring.Ten times the power of stars!Switch to Breath of Flame!Perfection Realm Fist Technique!Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes glowed, and he raised his right fist high. He had reached the Master-level zombie\u2019s line of sight!Boom!This punch landed heavily on the Master-level zombie\u2019s head. The Master-level zombie\u2019s head exploded with a bang.Its unprotected body staggered and fell backward under the impact of Lu Sheng\u2019s punch. A trace of guilt rose in Lu Sheng\u2019s heart.From the beginning to the end, this Master-level zombie had never attacked him once. It was always him attacking it.\u201cAs long as your spirit doesn\u2019t die, I will inherit your will!\u201d Lu Sheng muttered in his heart.The body of the zombie was quickly weathering, leaving only a set of lonely battle armor.A black line of smoke as thick as a forearm emerged from its body. Like a black python, it slammed into Lu Sheng\u2019s body.Lu Sheng retreated as if he had been hit hard. There was only one thought left in his mind.The memories of a Master.[Shi Shengning, congratulations on reaching Level 7. Henceforth, you can be called a Master!][The situation is worsening. Although the Star Realm masters have been running around, bases are still falling \u2026][\u201cThe first 100 bases are located in the centre of the Martial Alliance. It\u2019s the safest place in the entire world. I\u2019ve already arranged for the airship. You guys will depart in the afternoon.\u201d\u201cDad, aren\u2019t you coming with\u00a0us?\u201d\u201cI am a Master. I will stay on the front lines and shed my last drop of blood for the human race.\u201d][Grade 9 beasts are too terrifying. Even though I\u2019m only looking at them from afar, I\u2019m still scared witless.\u00a0As a Master, I have a strong will and should be fearless. Why would I be afraid?\u00a0Why?][Is there really hope? What about the future of the human race?][Master Wang He, known as the Eastern Evil Sun, is here! He has arrived at Base 1359! I was lucky enough to see Master Wang He in action. He is too powerful, too shocking.\u00a0With such a powerful being like Master Wang He, the human race will definitely win this war! Definitely!][The last time I saw Master Wang He in action, I gained a lot of insights. Inspiration gushed out like a fountain. I have a skill in spiritual \u2026][I did it! Hahaha, it\u2019s not impossible to reach Level 8 Grandmaster realm in this lifetime! \u2026][It hurts. My heart has been dug out. Is this how it feels before death? I heard that the Martial Alliance has commenced Project Fireseed. They intend to gather the power of the entire human race to create an unprecedented Level 12 powerhouse. They should be able to succeed \u2026 Unfortunately, I won\u2019t be present to witness it \u2026]It was more than any of the memories Lu Sheng had absorbed in the past. Countless fragmented images flashed through Lu Sheng\u2019s mind quickly.The life of a Martial Arts Master was legendary and wonderful. He had already activated Crystal Contemplation Method. The diamond humanoid was dyed pure black. Lu Sheng quickly absorbed the large amount of Martial Dao experience and combat techniques in the memories.Lu Sheng was lucky. This Master named Shi Shengning majored in fist techniques when he was alive. Lu Sheng could feel that his attainments in the Fist Technique were increasing rapidly.The Perfect Realm Fist Technique rose rapidly to the bottleneck of the Perfection Realm.Then, he broke through!Intricate Realm!Then, it continued to rise rapidly.Advanced Intricate Realm. Peak Intricate Realm.He broke through again.Mastery Realm!This was what Master Shi Shengning had learned in his life.The Mastery Level Fist Technique that he had honed in countless life-and-death battles with beasts was now perfectly inherited by Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng was overjoyed.Just this little bit of harvest was enough to be considered a treasure trove.Not to mention, he had yet to unearth the core treasure.\u201cWang He \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng captured this name in Shi Shengning\u2019s memory. This name seemed to be very important to Shi Shengning.In the last memory fragment of Shi Shengning\u2019s life, other than his wife and son, this name was mentioned the most by him.Coincidentally \u2026 Lu Sheng knew this name.\u201cThe creator of the Stellar Body Refinement Technique was called Wang He!\u201cHe has been in the martial arts world for ten thousand years. Obviously, he is also a famous big shot. They called him the Eastern Evil Sun. Even Shi Shengning, a Level 7 Master, is his fan \u2026\u201dLu Sheng cultivated the Stellar Body Refinement Technique that Wang He had created, so it was somewhat related to him. Now that he understood bits and pieces of this legendary figure through someone else\u2019s perspective, he could not help but feel a lot of emotions.\u201cShi Shengning seemed to have been inspired by Wang He\u2019s martial arts and created an extremely powerful martial art after seeing Wang He in action. Why can\u2019t I find it?\u201dLu Sheng was a little confused and kept searching through Shi Shengning\u2019s memories.At this moment, he saw a golden dot of light appear in the diamond figure in his mind.As the diamond figure breathed, the golden dot of light slowly melted.In an instant, a memory that Lu Sheng had never seen before appeared in his mind. It was a vast and barren wilderness.The world was filled with thick black fog.In the black fog, numerous strange beasts rushed out from the ground and the sky, tearing the black fog apart. It was like a tide that covered the sky and earth as it surged towards this side.Lu Sheng \u201csensed\u201d that his heart was trembling, his mouth was dry, and his legs were somewhat weak.\u201cI\u2019m a Master, I have no fear. Why would I be afraid? In this situation, even a Master would be torn apart in an instant \u2026 \u201dA thick sense of despair enveloped Lu Sheng\u2019s \u201cheart\u201d.A figure suddenly appeared in his vision.This figure was extremely fast, his whole body emitting a bright golden light, like a rising sun.Lu Sheng \u2018stared\u2019 at the figure.He vaguely saw the figure raise its right hand.The next moment \u2026 Ten suns appeared in the dark sky at the same time!Incomparably dazzling suns.Golden suns!Endless golden light shone down. Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes were filled with tears. He tried to open his eyes, but he could only see golden light.He did not know how much time had passed.The golden light gradually faded and Lu Sheng\u2019s vision recovered.He saw it.The countless strange beasts from before had all disappeared, along with the omnipresent black fog.The whole world was empty.All the filth had been cleansed away.All that was left was that thin but stalwart figure hovering in the distant sky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He said to himself: \u201cIn the ancient legends, the son of the Celestial Emperor was the Golden Crow. The Golden Crow had the duty of guarding the sun. Each Golden Crow represented a sun. When ten suns appeared in the sky at the same time, the rivers dried up, the earth cracked, and the endless light and heat burned everything. No living thing could survive under the ten suns \u2026\u201cThe martial arts Master Shi Shengning spent his entire life learning, expending painstaking effort, and even wanted to use it to reach the Level 8 Grandmaster realm. The name of this supreme Master technique is \u2026 Ten Suns One Sky!\u201dLu Sheng suddenly punched.With this punch, his huge spiritual energy quickly shrank towards the centre of his brain, collapsing.His eyes lit up with two golden suns.Waves of heat surged out from his fist.The light and heat twisted the air, forming ten illusory golden suns behind Lu Sheng\u2019s head.\u201cThis Master technique is of the same origin as mine, complementing each other.\u201d\u201cTen suns One Sky is now mine!\u201dLu Sheng sensed a drastic change in his Spiritual Power as he comprehended this Master Technique. His enormous Spiritual Power contracted rapidly, condensing into a single point and collapsing inward, emitting a golden glow.It was like a small sun, suspended in the heart of the diamond humanoid.Every time the diamond humanoid breathed, the sun\u2019s rays changed.The countless black spiritual impurities in the diamond humanoid were also disappearing under the sun\u2019s golden rays. On the other hand, this small golden sun was slowly growing stronger.\u201cMy Spiritual Power has undergone a qualitative change \u2026\u201dLu Sheng was shocked.After visualizing the diamond humanoid, his Spiritual Power was already very pure, five times that of Dong Qingxue\u2019s. It was also much stronger than ordinary spiritual masters.However, compared to now, his previous Spiritual Power seemed messy and loose.Lu Sheng could feel that his Spiritual Power had not changed much in terms of total volume, but in terms of quality, it was worlds apart from before.\u201cEarlier, If Xia Lin\u2019s Spiritual Power is like air, then Dong Qingxue\u2019s Spiritual Power is water, and mine is ice. The difference between the three is like the difference between gas, liquid, and solid. Now, my Spiritual Power is like a steel ball made of pure steel. Although it still retains the shape, its quality and hardness are many times greater than before. This is a huge improvement!\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s spiritual power spread out with a thought.In an instant, with him as the centre, the surrounding ground cracked.A piece of concrete that was more than ten meters in diameter and four to five meters thick slowly floated up.However, it did not take long for the spiritual power to dissipate, and the huge piece of concrete fell back to the ground.Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes shone. \u201cThe grasping power of my spiritual power is ten times stronger than before. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that the total volume of spiritual power is too small, it would not be impossible for my spiritual power to reach the level described in cultivation novels and help me fly!\u201dLu Sheng felt that in a sense, he had completely stepped into the level of an extraordinary being. Even ordinary martial artists could not imagine it.He was confident that he could crush a Level 3 or even Level 4 Martial Artists to death with his spiritual strength.This was a completely different concept from ordinary spiritual masters using weapons to defeat martial artists of the same level or challenging high-level martial artists.The latter mainly relied on attacking methods, while he \u2026 relied on pure strength to crush them.\u201cThere\u2019s also a force field similar to that of a Master-level zombie around me now \u2026\u201dLu Sheng could clearly sense that a thin film had appeared on the surface of his body. This thin layer came from the core of his spiritual power, the sun.If he didn\u2019t deliberately control it, there would only be a very faint layer. If he increased the output of his spiritual power, it would become much stronger.Even if it was strengthened to the limit, the thickness of the force field would be less than one percent of that of the Master level zombie.But it did exist.\u201cIt\u2019s equivalent to the embryonic form of the Martial Master\u2019s Will. Although it\u2019s just an infant now, it\u2019ll grow into a towering tree sooner or later. From there, it\u2019ll transform into a true Martial Master Will that belongs to me \u2026\u201dLu Sheng got up from the ground.Now, he had to find a few suitable subjects to test the Master technique he had just learned.The next day.Lu Sheng woke up earlier than usual because he had used up a lot of energy to test the Master Technique in the dream world last night.Looking at the dark sky outside the window, Lu Sheng simply practised the Stellar Body Refining Technique for a while.The advanced chapter of the Stellar Physical Exercise was the Immortal Golden Body.Every time he practised, he needed to use his spiritual power. After the embryonic form of the Martial Master Will was formed, his spiritual power transformed again, causing Lu Sheng\u2019s cultivation of this skill to become much smoother.He almost didn\u2019t need to deliberately control his spiritual power to cooperate with his movements like before. He became more at ease, and the cultivation efficiency was at least three times higher than before.The movements in the advanced chapter of Stellar Body Refining Technique were more abstruse and profound than those in the earlier chapter. During the process and after each movement, Lu Sheng could feel a different stimulation in his tendons and bones all over.It was numb, tingling, cold, burning, like thousands of knives cutting, like countless ants biting \u2026At first, this kind of stimulation made Lu Sheng feel so much pain that he wanted to die. If it weren\u2019t for his strong will, he almost couldn\u2019t have held on.But later, he slowly got used to it.Now that the embryonic form of the Martial Master Will was formed, Lu Sheng even began to enjoy this kind of stimulation.\u201cThe core of the pain is transformation, evolution, and the process of constantly growing strength. Thinking about it this way, this is the most wonderful feeling in the world \u2026\u201dLu Sheng slowly exhaled a breath.This breath was wrapped in a billowing heat wave, blowing the desk more than two meters away, scalding the pages of several books on the desk.Using his spiritual power to explore his body, Lu Sheng could \u201csee\u201d that every bone in his body was beginning to take on a hint of gold, giving off a faint metallic lustre.The fascia connected to the bones were like steel, extremely tough.His blood had also become thicker, at least several times thicker than that of ordinary people.The external manifestation was that Lu Sheng\u2019s skin had become extraordinarily delicate and smooth, even surpassing that of most girls, close to the skin of a baby.From an outsider\u2019s point of view, his whole person seemed to have a layer of beauty filter, making his already good facial features reach the level of divine jade.\u201cWhen one day I really reach the level of the Immortal Golden Body, maybe my bones will really become pure gold \u2026\u201dLu Sheng thought of the Martial Master Shi Shengning\u2019s memory of the figure who had struck out ten blazing suns with one hand.Eastern Evil Sun.Indeed, to be able to reach Level 11 of the Martial Dao and create level 11 cultivation techniques, none of them were simple characters.\u201cNow that I\u2019ve left the training camp, without the daily supply of exotic beast meat, I need to supplement my training. It\u2019s also time to get in touch with Xingshang Tang \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng thought to himself.He had already checked the history and future of Xingshang Tang in the dream world. The former was the focus of his attention.The historical data showed that Xingshan Tang had a certain family background, and the family was simple and honest, even conservative.It was also because of this that Xingshan Tang disappeared in less than two hundred years in history.Of course, since Lu Sheng had chosen it. It meant that the history of Xingshan Tang in this life was bound to change.As for whether it would be a temporary rise or a long-term prosperity, it would depend on their performance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He tidied up and went out of the room.Breakfast was already prepared, half of the table was filled, but his mother, Zheng Yufen, was still busy in the kitchen.The main reason was that there were two martial arts students in the family, and their appetites were amazing. Every meal was a big project.Fortunately, Lu Sheng and Lu Qinghe both worked hard. Lu Sheng had also received a one million yuan as a bonus from the Martial Arts Association, so his mother Zheng Yufen was filled with motivation and energy when cooking.In her own words, \u201cI\u2019m a little tired, but I\u2019m happy. Others envy me so much. Unit 3\u2019s Auntie Wang\u2019s son is in his second year of high school this year, and his BQV is less than 0.7. She cooks a table of food every day, and he\u2019s full by just having had two mouthfuls. She\u2019s worried to death every day \u2026\u201dLu Hai had already left for work early, and only his sister Lu Qinghe was sitting at the table, eating.Lu Qinghe was also very particular about eating.Carrying a schoolbag, only half of her butt was on the chair, and her two hands were constantly stuffing buns into her mouth.It was exactly the same as Lu Sheng\u2019s appearance when he was late for school and hurriedly ate two mouthfuls of breakfast before leaving.It was just that Lu Qinghe was a martial arts student, and her two mouthfuls were almost equivalent to an ordinary person\u2019s meal.\u201cHow can a girl eat so crudely? Who will dare to pursue you in the future?\u201dLu Sheng sat down next to Lu Qinghe, picked up the breakfast on the table, and ate slowly.His eating speed was not slower than Lu Qinghe\u2019s at all, and was even much faster.But the way he ate was much more elegant than Lu Qinghe\u2019s. He was cultured and refined, like a modest gentleman.Lu Qinghe wanted to refute Lu Sheng, but her two cheeks were stuffed full of meat buns, choking her until she rolled her eyes.Lu Sheng looked at her with a face full of pity, and kindly poured her a cup of hot milk.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, eat slowly.\u201dLu Qinghe gulped down a cup of milk in one breath, refilled another cup, slowed down, and ate slowly with the other food.\u201cI really don\u2019t understand, you sleep until eight or nine o\u2019clock every day, and you still go back to sleep from time to time during the day, how can you still be so strong? This doesn\u2019t make sense!\u201d Lu Qinghe muttered unconvincingly.Lu Sheng gracefully swallowed a bun in one bite, and said lightly, \u201cThis is talent, you can\u2019t learn it.\u201dLu Qinghe gave him two big eye rolls.\u201cOh, by the way, Brother.\u201dLu Qinghe suddenly thought of something, and asked curiously, \u201cOur school\u2019s third years will have their classes suspended soon, and we\u2019ll all go home and study by ourselves. Doesn\u2019t your school have that?\u201dLu Sheng shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t know, but it should be soon. Suspension of classes for self-study should be uniform for all the high schools in the city.\u201d\u201cHow long has it been since you went to school?\u201d Lu Qinghe suddenly asked.Lu Sheng stopped what he was doing and thought for a moment.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time \u2026 I\u2019ll go today.\u201d\u2026\u201cMister, to the Third High School.\u201dAfter breakfast, Lu Sheng hailed a taxi and headed to Third High School in Baihe City.Lu Qinghe\u2019s words reminded him.The college entrance examination was approaching, and the school was about to close. If he did not go to school now, it would be difficult for him to meet certain people in the future.The taxi stopped in front of the Third High School. Lu Sheng paid the fare and got off. It was already past the school hour, so the school gate was unusually empty.Lu Sheng walked to the small security room next to the electric door and knocked on the window. Half a head popped out from inside.\u201cHow late are you? Call your class teacher and ask him to come and get you.\u201d\u201cSir, I took leave earlier. I only returned to school today.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dThe security guard in a military coat walked out of the security room with a small notebook in his hand.\u201cWhich class are you from? Let me register.\u201d\u201cGrade 12 Class 5, Lu Sheng. Our class teacher is Hong Jianjun.\u201d\u201cGrade 12 \u2026 Class 5, Lu \u2026\u201d The security guard stopped what he was doing and looked up at Lu Sheng through the reading glasses on his nose.\u201cWhat did you say your name was? Lu Sheng?! This Lu, this Sheng?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Seeing Lu Sheng nod and looking at Lu Sheng\u2019s appearance and temperament, the security guard\u2019s old face became excited.\u201cYou\u2019re Lu Sheng? The martial arts prodigy on TV? You\u2019re from the Third High School \u2026 Wait, I\u2019ll make a call.\u201dBefore he could finish, the security guard hurried back into the security room. Lu Sheng was left standing at the school gate with a helpless expression.\u201cSir, why don\u2019t you let me in first?\u201d\u2026Grade 12 Class 5, Mathematics class.The class teacher, Hong Jianjun, was lecturing on the podium with spittle flying everywhere. The students below were drowsy.\u201cLet me tell you, don\u2019t underestimate the results of cultural studies. I know many of you are applying for martial arts universities, but don\u2019t forget that cultural studies are also included in the martial sciences scores.\u201cSometimes, you might miss the chance to get into the martial arts university you want because of it. If you miss one point of BQV, you might have to spend a few weeks or even a few months to train and still get it back. But in cultural studies, it\u2019s just a matter of a few big questions!\u201d\u2026\u201cWhen will the class end \u2026\u201dBelow the podium, a thin and fair boy wearing glasses muttered listlessly. Then, he stretched out his hand and poked a little fatty sitting next to him.\u201cLiu Qiming, do you want to go online after school? I\u2019m almost platinum.\u201dLittle Fatty turned around and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not going. You guys go ahead. I signed up for a martial arts training class. After school, I have to go for extra training.\u201d\u201cWhy are you working so hard recently? It\u2019s so unlike you.\u201d\u201cBrother, it\u2019s almost time for the college entrance examination. I really don\u2019t want to be a construction worker after graduation.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so \u2026\u201dThe skinny boy was just about to say a few words when the cold voice of his homeroom teacher, Hong Jianjun, came from the podium.\u201cZhu Xingji, Liu Qiming, stand up!\u201dThe skinny boy and the little fatty\u2019s expressions turned bitter as they slowly stood up.They were getting ready to listen to their homeroom teacher scold and lecture them, but they didn\u2019t expect someone to wave from the door at the teacher, making him suddenly leave the class.Hong Jianjun glared at the two of them and hurried out.\u201cWow, we\u2019re lucky. The school leaders came just in time.\u201d The skinny boy beamed with joy.Liu Qiming glared at him and complained: \u201cAnd you said, don\u2019t talk to me in class in the future.\u201d\u201cThere aren\u2019t many classes left to talk about. They\u2019re about to be suspended \u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, they\u2019re about to be suspended.\u201dSomeone on the side immediately followed up.\u201cOh, they\u2019re finally going to be suspended!\u201d\u201cOh~\u201dIn a short while, the whole class became noisy.At this time, the homeroom teacher, Hong Jianjun, who had gone out to talk to the leader, quickly came back.The big classroom instantly fell silent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On the contrary, he was beaming with joy, his face brimming with excitement and joy.\u201cDid he get a promotion and a raise?\u201dZhu Xingji whispered. Liu Qiming, who was next to him, rolled his eyes at him.\u201cStudents, this class will be suspended. Everyone get ready \u2026\u201d\u201cSo the leader is coming to inspect.\u201d Zhu Xingji guessed with certainty.But Hong Jianjun\u2019s next sentence plunged the whole class into a strange silence.\u201c\u2026 Our classmate, Lu Sheng, will be here soon.\u201d After that, Hong Jianjun ignored them, turned around, and ran out of the classroom.In the next second, the entire class burst into a heated discussion. Everyone was boiling with excitement.\u201cDamn! Did I hear wrong? Lu Sheng came back to class?!\u201d\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be back to class. The class is about to be suspended. Why would he come back? He must have something to do.\u201d\u201cHe came back to see us!\u201d\u201cGod, I thought I\u2019d never see him again. I heard that Lu Sheng was accepted as the last disciple of the Martial Arts Association. He\u2019s been training hard on the top floor of the Martial Arts Association building every day, preparing to break through!\u201d\u201cI heard that the mayor wanted to marry his daughter to Lu Sheng, but Lu Sheng refused because he wanted to focus on martial arts and prepare for the college entrance exam!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAutograph! It\u2019s not easy to meet Lu Sheng. I must get his autograph!\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s my record? Where did I put my record?\u201d\u201cDamn, I have to find the test paper with the highest score and get Lu Sheng to sign it. I\u2019ll frame it and hang it on the wall at home.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dFor a moment, the big classroom was noisy and chaotic. Everyone was rummaging through boxes and cabinets.Lu Sheng was coming \u2026Liu Qiming sat in his seat for a few seconds before he suddenly reacted and was busy looking for something. Although he didn\u2019t know what he was looking for.Ten minutes later, the boy who was standing at the door of the class to inquire about the news quickly ran back.He gestured.\u201cHe\u2019s coming! He\u2019s coming!\u201dThe students of the whole class instantly fell silent. They sat neatly in their seats. Everyone sat up straight, but their necks were stretched out. Their heads were uniformly tilted in the direction of the classroom door.Their faces were filled with excitement, and anticipation \u2026Liu Qiming was also looking around, waiting for a certain figure to appear.Not long after, everyone saw a group of people surrounding a person quickly walking over. The homeroom teacher, Hong Jianjun, the combat teacher, Zhong Zhenguo, the principal, the vice principal, the dean \u2026Almost all the leaders of the school were here.Every one of them had a smile on their faces. They were amiable and approachable.And in the center of them was a young man who was about the same age as them. He was 1.8 meters tall and had a tall and straight posture.The young man had a high nose bridge, starry eyes, and fair skin.Although he was simply dressed in a white t-shirt and black casual pants, he gave people a feeling of an idol star on TV or a school hunk in a manga.There was an indescribable elegance and temperament in his every movement.Even though he was surrounded by a group of leaders who were much older than him, he still exuded a powerful aura.He was like the sun at eight or nine o\u2019clock in the morning, dazzling but not scorching.The students of Class 5 were stunned. Many of the girls stared straight at the young man, as if little stars were popping out of their eyes.Liu Qiming was also in a trance.The radiant and handsome young man in front of him was completely different from the ordinary buddy in his memory.He felt as if something was quickly leaving him, disappearing \u2026 completely out of his grasp.\u201cStudents, let\u2019s welcome Lu Sheng on his return!\u201d The homeroom teacher, Hong Jianjun, strode to the podium and said loudly with a flushed face.The students of Class 5 were stunned for a few seconds. Then, they burst into a cacophony of intense screams, cheers, and applause.Lu Sheng stood awkwardly and helplessly on the podium. He originally just wanted to go back to the school to have a look. He didn\u2019t expect to cause such a big commotion.He wasn\u2019t a leader, he was just an ordinary student.Lu Sheng thought for a moment, then raised his hand and pressed it down.The noisy classroom instantly quieted down.The students of Class 5 didn\u2019t even realize that Lu Sheng seemed to have some kind of special magic that made people subconsciously want to listen to him.\u201cTeacher Hong.\u201d Lu Sheng turned to look at Hong Jianjun and said: \u201cI want to listen you give one last cultural lesson, is that okay?\u201d\u201cUh \u2026\u201d Hong Jianjun was stunned for a moment. Then, his square face quickly flushed red. He was so excited that he almost spoke incoherently.\u201cYes, of course you can.\u201d\u201cThank you, Teacher Hong.\u201dLu Sheng walked down the podium and found his seat.He saw Liu Qiming staring at him blankly. He smiled at him.In the following time, Hong Jianjun seemed to be twenty years younger. On the podium, he used both his hands and feet to give the most outstanding lesson in his teaching career.The students of Class 5 had never listened so seriously before.The bell rang once. The students of the other classes came out. They were surprised to see that Class 5 was very quiet. Only the sound of the lecture echoed in the corridor.Moreover, the school leaders were all standing at the door with smiles on their faces.They curiously walked over to see. Not long after, the news of Lu Sheng\u2019s return to the school spread throughout the entire high school.The entire school boiled up.\u2026\u201cClass dismissed!\u201dHong Jianjun swore that he had never said those two words so perfectly and so reluctantly.Hong Jianjun\u2019s gaze looked at a certain place under the podium. The students of Class 5 also looked at that place.The bright and beautiful youth sitting in that place stood up and swept his gaze over the class.It was as if he wanted to remember every face here.\u201cThen I\u2019ll leave first. Goodbye everyone.\u201dBefore leaving, the youth lightly patted Liu Qiming\u2019s shoulder. He bent down and whispered in Liu Qiming\u2019s ear: \u201cDo your best. If you have time \u2026 let\u2019s move up together.\u201dLiu Qiming felt as if he was struck by lightning. His whole body couldn\u2019t help but tremble slightly.He looked at the youth\u2019s departing figure and secretly swore in his heart.He, Liu Qiming, even if he risked his life and died of exhaustion \u2026 He had to get into a martial arts university.He had to!Lu Sheng walked out of the school. Behind him was a sea of jubilation. He realized that he had underestimated his current influence. Or rather, he had almost forgotten about it.Passing the Official Level 2 Martial Artist Assessment at the age of seventeen. To a group of high school students with an average BQV of less than 0.8 and struggling to make it to the undergraduate level, what kind of concept was that?A god!A legend!Especially to the students of his alma mater, Baihe Third High School, that was a legend that belonged to them.They were proud of it!They would become the batch that would be recorded in the history of Baihe Third High School.The school leaders of Baihe Third High School also warmly expressed that Lu Sheng was welcome to come back any time.They had already decided to make Lu Sheng an honorary alumnus of Baihe Third High School. Lu Sheng\u2019s deeds and experiences would be placed at the top of the alumnus column for countless future students to admire.He had delayed a lot of time at school. It was almost lunchtime.Thinking that he still had something to do, Lu Sheng took out his phone and dialled a number.The call was picked up almost instantly.Lu Sheng calmly said, \u201cI am Lu Sheng.\u201dA voice that was so excited that it was about to morph came from the phone.\u201cI know, I know \u2026 (Miss He)!\u201d\u201cIf you want to talk about cooperation, ask the person in charge of Xingshan Tang to wait for me at Century Square\u2019s Cherry Blossom Restaurant in twenty minutes.\u201dAfter saying that, Lu Sheng hung up without waiting for the person on the other end to respond.He skilfully exited and turned off his phone. Lu Sheng casually stopped a taxi and got in.\u201cSir, go to Century Square.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then, he smiled and nodded. \u201cYes, someone is treating me to a meal. I have to go even if I have to skip class.\u201d\u201cLooks like it\u2019s a big restaurant.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s quite high-class.\u201d\u2026He Ling Su sat in the lobby of this high-class western restaurant. She wore a black one-piece dress and did not wear any jewellery. She only had simple makeup on, but she still looked very beautiful.He Ling Su did not know how many times she had checked the time on her phone. She was very anxious.It had only been five minutes since the appointed time, but He Ling Su felt like a long time had passed. She had waited for this day for too long.She had thought that there was no hope. However, she did not expect that the other party would take the initiative to propose a collaboration with her.He Ling Su was so happy that it took her less than 15 minutes to get dressed and arrive at the meeting place.\u201cBefore the other party arrives, let\u2019s think about how to negotiate \u2026\u201d He Ling Su made a plan in her mind.After taking over the family business for so long, she had seen many people and experienced many situations. She could be considered experienced.\u201cWhen it comes to cooperation, the most important thing is one\u2019s aura. As long as you overwhelm the other party with your aura, the direction of the conversation will naturally be controlled by you \u2026\u201dThis was what He Ling Su had learned in a business management class.The other party was only a high school student. Even if his martial arts talent was a little strong, his aura definitely wouldn\u2019t be too strong. As long as I act a little stronger, there shouldn\u2019t be a problem.What she was afraid of was that it wasn\u2019t just that high school student that would come.He Ling Su frowned slightly.She knew very well that such a prescription could not have been researched by a high school student.There was probably someone behind the other party.This time, the person who took the initiative to contact him was probably the mastermind behind the scenes.\u201cDing ding-dong dong~\u201dHer phone rang.He Ling Su glanced at the caller ID and quickly picked up the phone. Ma Fei\u2019s voice came from the other end of the phone.\u201cMiss He, he\u2019s here! He\u2019s here!\u201d\u201cHow many people?\u201d He Lingsu asked.\u201cOne, Lu Sheng himself. I don\u2019t see anyone else.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dHe Ling Su hung up the phone and breathed a sigh of relief. If it was only that high school student Lu Sheng, it would be easy.She was completely confident that she could take him down.Thinking of this, He Ling Su regained her usual calmness and wisdom. She checked her makeup and clothes a little and sat quietly in her seat, waiting for the other party to arrive.Not long after, He Ling Su saw a tall and lean boy walk in from outside the restaurant.Just like on TV, to be precise, he was more dazzling than what He Ling su saw on TV.The well-proportioned tall and slender body of martial arts student, coupled with fair skin and handsome facial features, made He Ling Su almost think that some idol star had appeared.After the boy walked into the restaurant, he didn\u2019t make any moves to search for her. He walked straight to He Ling Su as if he already knew that she was sitting there.The handsome boy walked to He Ling Su and sat down casually. He picked up the menu on the table and said to He Ling Su as if they were old friends who hadn\u2019t seen each other for many years, \u201cI heard that the steaks in this restaurant are very good. Do you mind if we talk over lunch?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dHe Ling Su faintly felt the opening to be a little different from what she had expected.She was thinking about how to start when she heard the boy opposite her ask the waiter who had already followed them, \u201cWhat\u2019s the best kind of steak you have?\u201d\u201cThe 1,288 kind, sir.\u201d\u201cOkay, then give me 20 steaks first, medium well.\u201d\u201cO \u2026 Okay, sir.\u201dUh \u2026He Ling Su choked and deliberately raised her head to look at the other party.Was he a pig?He wanted to eat 20 steaks in one sitting!Yes, he was a martial arts student. It was normal for him to have a big appetite.1,288 for one steak. Twenty steaks would be 25,600.He Ling Su quickly did the math in her mind and felt the faint pain in her mind.But when she thought about how the other party ate so much, he might not have the nerve to ask her to foot the bill, she felt relieved.\u201cDo you want to eat?\u201dLu Sheng held the menu and asked.He Ling Su shook her head.She didn\u2019t have any appetite before they started talking.\u201cOkay, that\u2019s all for now.\u201d Lu Sheng waved the waiter away.Seeing that Lu Sheng didn\u2019t do anything else, He Ling Su sorted out her thoughts and prepared to speak.\u201cLu \u2026\u201d\u201cHe Ling Su, 22 years old. ancestral home, Yi County, Guanglin City, Xing\u2019an Province. Your great-great-great grandfather, He Jiming, was originally just an apprentice at Old Ji\u2019an Medicine Shop.\u201cIn the early decades of martial arts, he relied on his decent martial arts talent and outstanding pharmaceutical talent to become a Level 5 Pharmacist. He also founded Xingshan Tang \u2026\u201cXingshan Tang was quite prosperous in the early years. Branches spread across more than 20 cities in Dongning Province, totaling 213 branches \u2026\u201cUnfortunately, due to poor management, it quickly declined in your father generation, He Hezhi \u2026\u201dBefore He Lingsu could say anything, she heard Lu Sheng ramble on.After the initial shock, He Ling Su quickly calmed down and said with a hint of sarcasm, \u201cMr. Lu, what are you trying to say by reading such a long paragraph of information that can be easily found on the internet? Do you have an amazing memory?\u201d\u201cNo, not just that.\u201dLu Sheng smiled and said, \u201cI also know that your mother, Chen Lan, hasn\u2019t returned to Dongning Province for 20 years due to family reasons. She hasn\u2019t seen you, her daughter, even once.\u201cThe reason why your Xingshan Tang collapsed so quickly in your father\u2019s hands, other than the fact that it\u2019s really old-fashioned and poor management is your mother. The Chen Family, has been secretly suppressing it for many years \u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dHe Ling Su was so shocked that she accidentally spilled the lemonade on the table in front of her.\u201cMr. Lu, are you telling the truth? You know some things can\u2019t be said with caution!\u201dHe Ling Su stared into Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes, her expression turning fierce. However, Lu Sheng only needed to slightly lean his body forward to disintegrate her aura.\u201cWhether I\u2019m telling the truth or not, you\u2019ll know when you go home and ask your father, He Hezhi \u2026 Thank you!\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s 20 portions of steak arrived and filled the entire table. After that, Lu Sheng didn\u2019t say a word and focused on eating the steak in front of him.To Lu Sheng, the taste of the steak didn\u2019t matter. What he cared about was the quality of the steak. The quality of the meat was high in nutrients and could provide more energy for his martial arts cultivation.This was also the reason why he had chosen this restaurant.At this moment, He Ling Su was in a state of deep shock and confusion. What Lu Sheng said about her mother was something that even she didn\u2019t know about.However, her mother did indeed leave when she was two years old. Her father, He Hezhi, said that the two of them didn\u2019t have a good relationship and divorced very early on.When she was young, He Ling Su had complained more than once about how cruel her mother was. She stayed with her father after the divorce. Why didn\u2019t she even come visit her for so many years?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 94": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Logging 10,000 Years into the FutureCH 94Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHe Ling Su also often saw her father, He Hezhi, hiding in the room alone and crying secretly while hugging her mother\u2019s photo. He didn\u2019t look like someone who had a bad marriage at all.Come to think of it, during the two years after her mother left, her father would go on a long trip almost every year.Every time he came back, he would be exhausted, depressed, and dishevelled. These doubts that were buried deep in her memory were almost forgotten by her.Now that Lu Sheng had pointed it out, she felt a sense of dread when she connected the dots.The most important point was \u2026The last thing Lu Sheng pointed out was the reason why the He Family\u2019s Xingshan Tang\u2019s business collapsed so quickly.It was like a ray of light that suddenly woke He Ling Su up.Yes, the decline of Xingshan Tang seemed to have happened in the past ten or twenty years. It had started slowly when her father took over.It had suffered a disastrous decline.He Ling Su clearly remembered that at its worst, there were shops closing down almost every day for a few months.Logically speaking, even if the business was not good and the products couldn\u2019t compete, it should not have been so bad.Moreover, she knew her father\u2019s ability. He should not have been so stupid and incompetent.She thought about the time she had taken over the He family\u2019s business. She had been running around for the new medicines, but every time there was a good cooperation project, it would mysteriously fall through.Take for example the time when she found the new supplement in Lu Sheng\u2019s hands a few months ago. The other party had promised to discuss cooperation with her, but while she was on the way, the other party suddenly changed his mind.This was not the first time something like this had happened. It had too many such precedents.He Ling Su had always thought that it was her bad luck, but now she understood. It turned out that everything was because there was a mastermind orchestrating it.If it was really as Lu Sheng said, that it was her mother\u2019s doing \u2026 He Ling Su broke out in a cold sweat in broad daylight, and her hair stood on end.Looking at He Ling Su\u2019s expression, Lu Sheng knew that she had believed most of it. He had found this information from the Fireseed Repository.He had to admit that the Fireseed Repository was indeed powerful.In the thick history books, a person or a family could be summarized by a sentence or even a punctuation mark. But because of the existence of the Fireseed Repository, this punctuation mark could be redefined to an exaggerated degree.Lu Sheng raised his hand to call the waiter over and asked him to clear the table. He then ordered another twenty steaks, and his gaze fell back on He Ling Su.\u201cMiss He, please don\u2019t blame me for investigating too deeply and in detail. It is necessary to have a certain understanding of a possible long-term partner \u2026\u201dHe Ling Su took a deep breath and tried her best to calm down her turbulent heart.\u201cI\u2019ll verify Mr. Lu\u2019s words myself later. Let\u2019s talk about our cooperation.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dLu Sheng nodded, and then said straightforwardly, \u201cI will be responsible for providing the prescription and the corresponding technical guidance. Xingshan Tang will be responsible for production and sales. In the end, I want 90% of the profits.\u201d\u201c90%?!\u201dHe Ling Su almost jumped out of her chair.He laughed coldly.\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Mr. Lu ask for all of it?\u201d\u201cI want to, but I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t agree.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe Ling Su was so angry that her chest heaved up and down.Lu Sheng thought for a moment. \u201cWhat is Miss He\u2019s expectation?\u201d\u201cSixty percent,\u201d He Ling Su said without hesitation. \u201cSeventy percent at most.\u201d\u201cOf the extra twenty percent, ten percent is to guarantee a long-term cooperation, and the other ten percent is \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng smiled. \u201cAdditional payment for helping Miss He deal with problems.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He Ling Su said in a deep voice.Lu Sheng skilfully called the waiter to serve another twenty steaks on the table. Then, he started chewing quickly and gracefully, one piece at a time.He Ling Su\u2019s eyelids twitched. She had never seen anyone who could eat so much and eat so quickly, yet they didn\u2019t look displeasing at all.\u201cThe He family has been bullied by the Chen family from the capital for so many years. Doesn\u2019t Miss He want to avenge the grievance? Even if you don\u2019t \u2026\u201dLu Sheng ate the steak in big bites, and occasionally took a sip of the lemonade on the table. \u201cCan you be sure that they won\u2019t bully you in the future?\u201d he said casually.He Ling Su\u2019s expression changed drastically.She didn\u2019t realize it at all. At this moment, she was completely immersed in this discussion, and was completely led by the young man who had been burying his head in eating his steaks.\u201cFine. Even if I want to, what guarantee do I have that you can help me get justice from the Chen family?\u201d He Ling Su asked coldly. She had almost admitted that everything Lu Sheng said about her mother was true.When Lu Sheng heard this, he suddenly stopped what he was doing. He put down his knife and fork, picked up the napkin next to him, and carefully wiped his mouth.Then he put his right hand in front of He Ling Su.\u201cLook here, Miss He.\u201d Lu Sheng said softly.He Ling Su was stunned. She didn\u2019t know what Lu Sheng wanted to do.But Lu Sheng\u2019s voice and movements seemed to contain some kind of special magic that made her eyes follow him unconsciously.The next second, He Ling Su saw. The lemonade that she accidentally spilled on the table floated up bit by bit.Like a scene from a sci-fi movie, it quickly condensed into a transparent ball of liquid under He Ling Su\u2019s eyes, and finally gathered in Lu Sheng\u2019s palm.He Ling Su\u2019s eyes suddenly widened. She subconsciously wanted to cry out in surprise.But Lu Sheng gently stopped her, and made a shushing gesture.\u201cMiss He should understand what this means, right?\u201dThe ball of lemonade in Lu Sheng\u2019s hand turned into an irregular shape, suddenly boiled, and finally evaporated without a trace.He Ling Su stared blankly as the ball of lemonade that disappeared in Lu Sheng\u2019s palm. And the tablecloth that was soaked by the lemonade was now clean, without a trace.He Ling Su wasn\u2019t an ignorant woman. She knew that this wasn\u2019t magic, nor was it some kind of sci-fi trick, but it meant \u2026\u201cYou\u2019re a spiritual master.\u201d He Ling Su uttered the words with a wooden expression.She re-examined Lu Sheng\u2019s information.Seventeen years old, Level 2 Martial Artist. Best talent in Baihe city.And now, he had the legendary talent of a spiritual master \u2026He Ling Su didn\u2019t know what to say. Even if she wasn\u2019t a martial artist, she knew the weight of this talent.It was exaggerated.Very exaggerated.Outstanding talent, plus the shrewdness, wisdom, and methods that Lu Sheng had shown so far \u2026 In time, who knew how much Lu Sheng would grow?\u201cAnd \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng retracted his hand and said indifferently: \u201cMiss He just alluded to something. It seems that Miss He doesn\u2019t think that I came up with this prescription on my own.\u201d\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d He Ling Su blurted out.With such exaggerated martial arts talent, if he also had such outrageous talent in medicine \u2026 How was she supposed to live then?Absolutely impossible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Logging 10,000 Years into the FutureCH 95Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dLu Sheng smiled and said: \u201cTen percent of the profits in exchange for the support of me and the power behind me. Is there a better deal in the world than this?\u201d\u201cMiss He.\u201dHe Ling Su\u2019s face quickly changed colours. If everything was as Lu Sheng said. Then she would have to face the Chen family sooner or later. Even if she didn\u2019t have any complaints or thoughts of revenge for what happened in the past twenty years. But the other party might not be willing to let her go.The prescription that she and Lu Sheng were discussing now was the best excuse. He Ling Su still understood the principle of \u201ctreasuring a jade ring becomes a crime*\u201d.[TN: meaning how valuables often attract trouble.]After making a choice, He Ling Su finally made up her mind.\u201cOkay!\u201d He Ling Su agreed. \u201cI hope that Mr. Lu will fulfil his promise.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Lu Sheng smiled, then took out a small memory card from his pocket and handed it to He Ling Su.\u201cThis is the prescription for the Spiritual Muscle and Blood Strengthening Decoction. Find time to register the prescription at the Pharmaceutical Manufacturer\u2019s Association. If there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t understand during the preparation process, feel free to ask me. I don\u2019t care about anything else, I believe in your ability. Also, I want to borrow your lab [referred to as \u201cblending room\u201d previously] for a while. Arrange a time slot for me.\u201dHe Ling Su nodded repeatedly. She felt that the moment the cooperation was officially negotiated. Lu Sheng\u2019s aura changed. He became condescending. He became more oppressive, more aggressive, more certain, and more irrefutable.It was as if she wasn\u2019t facing a seventeen-year-old high school student, but some high and mighty big shot.Even when he spoke, his tone was commanding.The way he addressed her also changed from \u201cMiss He\u201d to \u201cyou\u201d. And she couldn\u2019t even muster an opposing word against him.It was as if everything was a matter of course.\u201cOkay, I\u2019m full. If there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019ll take my leave. Happy cooperation.\u201dLu Sheng stood up, pointed at the twenty empty plates stacked high in front of him, and said to He Ling Su, \u201cThis steak is of good quality. I suggest you try it.\u201dWith that, he turned and left.He Ling Su stared blankly at Lu Sheng\u2019s back as he left. She was in a daze for a while. Thinking about how she had prepared so carefully, but in the end, she had to give up 90% of the profits, she felt like she was in a dream.This was completely different from what she had expected.\u201cMiss~\u201dA person\u2019s voice interrupted He Ling Su\u2019s thoughts.He Ling Su looked up and found the restaurant\u2019s waiter standing in front of her.\u201cThe bill?\u201dHe Ling Su was stunned, then realized that Lu Sheng wanted her to foot the bill. Although she was a little unhappy, He Ling Su still nodded and said, \u201cSure, how much is it?\u201dThe waiter glanced at the bill and said, \u201cThe total is 115,200 yuan. I\u2019ll round off the 200, so it\u2019ll be 115,000 yuan.\u201dHe Ling Su was about to take out the money, but when she heard the number, she was stunned. She wondered if she had heard wrong.\u201cHow much? 115,000?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHe Ling Su was so anxious that she almost screamed, \u201cDidn\u2019t he order a total of 40 plates of the 1,288 yuan steak?\u201dThe waiter patiently explained, \u201cIt was the 1,288 yuan steak, yes. But this gentleman ordered a total of 90 plates.\u201d\u201c90 plates? Where did the 90 plates come from? He only ate 40 plates! And he said he was full!\u201d\u201cHe packed 50 plates and said he would bring them home for his family to try.\u201d\u201cAh \u2026\u201d He Ling Su\u2019s mouth was wide open. She was frozen on the spot, unmoving.Then, her breathing began to quicken. Her chest rose and fell rapidly. It was as if there was a fire animation playing behind her.\u201cLu! Sheng!\u201d He Ling Su gritted her teeth enunciated his name.Finally, she looked helplessly at the waiter in front of her.\u201cDo you accept credit cards here?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLu Sheng carried a total of 50 packed top-grade steaks and strolled along the pedestrian street of Century Square. He attracted the attention of passer-by.Lu Sheng was quite satisfied with the results of the cooperation with Xingshan Tang today. He got what he wanted, and it exceeded his expectations.Lu Sheng\u2019s original intentions were to take 80% of the profits, but he had raised it to 90%. He didn\u2019t expect that He Ling Su would actually agree after some persuasion.\u201cWhen He Ling Su comes back to her senses, she\u2019ll probably regret it.\u201dNot to mention that he even freeloaded a family bucket worth of steaks from her before leaving.\u201cHe Ling Su\u2019s family is simple and honest. Although she\u2019s not very capable, I don\u2019t need her to be too capable. She just needs to be obedient \u2026\u201dThis was very important.Lu Sheng also carefully studied the three generations of the He family before finally deciding to cooperate with He Ling Su.As for the trouble that He Ling Su brought with her.It was not a problem much of a problem for Lu Sheng.As long as he was strong enough, any trouble was not a problem. He just needed to crush it.Although Lu Sheng\u2019s current strength was not very strong. His talent was outstanding. Talent itself was also a part of one\u2019s strength. It could bring a lot of power.If the power brought by talent was not enough, then show more talent.Lu Sheng\u2019s way of thinking was so crude and simple.And he also checked.The Chen family of the Capital standing behind He Ling Su\u2019s mother was not very powerful. It was just an insignificant family in the Capital.The reason why they could make the He family like this was because the He family was too weak.In fact, Lu Sheng did not think too much.Since he took on the mission of reversing the fate of the human race, any internal conflict was just a small matter to him.He strolled home slowly. It was almost four in the afternoon by the time he reached.Zheng Yufen had already finished work and was preparing dinner.After Lu Sheng came back, Zheng Yufen pushed away most of her part-time jobs so that she could have more time to cook for him.\u201cWhat did you bring back? Why so much?\u201dAs soon as Lu Sheng entered the house, Zheng Yufen smelled a tempting aroma of meat. She followed it from the kitchen to the living room.Lu Sheng put the take out box on the table and smiled. \u201cSteak, from a high-class restaurant. You don\u2019t have to cook tonight. Let\u2019s have steak.\u201d\u201cTell me if you want to eat steak. I\u2019ll go to the market and buy beef for you. What\u2019s the point of going to a restaurant? It\u2019s expensive, and the portions are small. How much did this pile cost?\u201dZheng Yufen looked pained.Lu Sheng casually replied, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me who spent the money, it was my friend\u2019s treat, a rich second generation kid, he\u2019s rich! If I didn\u2019t accept it, he\u2019d have been mad at me.\u201dHe wondered how He Ling Su, who had just walked out of the restaurant with her credit card maxed out, would feel when she heard this.\u201cI see \u2026\u201dHearing this, Zheng Yufen\u2019s expression relaxed, but she still warned him, \u201cDon\u2019t do this in the future. Even though they gave it to you, it\u2019s not good for you to take it for free. Then I won\u2019t cook. I\u2019ll warm up these steaks. Sigh, this is too much \u2026\u201dLu Sheng let Zheng Yufen do whatever she wanted and went back to his room alone.Back in his room, Lu Sheng sat in front of his desk, thinking about his next plan.\u201cTomorrow, I\u2019ll have He Ling Su buy the ingredients to concoct the Spiritual Muscle and Blood Strengthening Decoction and the Marrow Nourishing Pill. These two supplements have special effects on refining muscles and bones, and they\u2019re also the most cost-effective. As long as there\u2019s enough of them, I could use to them reach Level 4. Then there\u2019s the matter of the spiritual master weapon \u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 96": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Logging 10,000 Years into the FutureCH 96Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLu Sheng looked at the computer in front of him.Lu Hai had bought this computer for Lu Sheng\u2019s tenth birthday. He had been using it until now. The spec was very old, and it ran very slowly.Lu Sheng had used the Photon Mind technology of the next ten thousand years in the dream world, and now he had to use this thing.It was as uncomfortable as driving a tractor for someone who was used to driving a sports car.Fortunately, what he had to do was not complicated. He just had to log in to receive the email from Dong Qingxue and go online to check for information.Because Lu Sheng had not taken the official Spiritual Master Assessment, he could not log in to the Star Web.The Star Web was similar to the Martial Artist Home that Lu Sheng had logged in once after he became an official martial artist.It was a small circle of spiritual masters. Almost all the needs of a spiritual master could be satisfied on the Star Web.\u201cI\u2019ll find time to pass the Spiritual Master Assessment before the Qiming General Selection. I can\u2019t trouble Dong Qingxue every time I need something. It\u2019ll be easy to expose my secret \u2026\u201dLu Sheng silently made up his mind.Lu Sheng clicked on the email sent by Dong Qingxue. It was a clean and simple form.It listed the price of each spiritual master weapon material that Lu Sheng wanted to know about, as well as a detailed introduction.Lu Sheng looked through it carefully.The materials he had asked Dong Qingxue to check mainly came from two types of weapons.One was the Unceasing Blade Wheel, and the other was the Silver Sky Shuttle.The names of these two weapons also represented the corresponding spiritual power combat techniques.These two weapons were the strongest techniques below Level 6 that Lu Sheng had found from the Fireseed Repository.Although they were not included in the Fireseed Program, they were still recognized as the most powerful spiritual techniques in martial arts for more than ten thousand years.Of course, there were more powerful weapons than these two, but Lu Sheng did not like other types of weapons.They were like awls, needles, and silk \u2026 He felt that they were not masculine enough and were only used by female spiritual masters.Lu Sheng quickly browsed through the information recorded in the form. At the same time, he quickly calculated the cost of forging these two weapons in his mind.Five minutes later, Lu Sheng looked disappointed.\u201cIt\u2019s too expensive. I can\u2019t afford it \u2026\u201dLu Sheng finally understood why Dong Qingxue had told him not to think it was too little when she had placed the five million yuan reward in front of him. It was mainly because of her sincerity.Lu Sheng had initially thought that Dong Qingxue and Qin Shaojun had come from extraordinary families and had set their sights too high. That was why they thought five million yuan was too little.Now he knew.It turned out that five million yuan was really too little.\u201cJust the main material used to forge the Unceasing Blade Wheel and the shuttle, which is the most expensive, requires nine thousand yuan per gram. That\u2019s close to ten thousand. A blade wheel should weigh at least 1 catty (0.5 kg or 1.1 lbs). I\u2019ve already lost more than five million yuan. That\u2019s not including the other supplementary materials. I can\u2019t even forge one blade wheel.\u201d\u201cAnd, moreover, the quality of my spiritual power far surpasses that of my peers. Ordinary dense iron blade wheels might feel too light to use, so it\u2019s best to have them made of higher-quality dense silver. But that would make the cost even higher. The price of dense silver with an equivalent quality is ten times that of dense iron! It\u2019s truly too exaggerated\u2026\u201dAfter some calculations, Lu Sheng realized that he could not even afford to forge a single spiritual weapon, let alone a set of spiritual weapons.\u201cThere\u2019s no other way. If I don\u2019t have the money, I\u2019ll have to dig the materials out in the wilderness by myself.\u201dLu Sheng frowned and muttered to himself, \u201cIt\u2019s not realistic to dig out all of them. It\u2019s best to dig a part and buy a part. After gathering all the materials, I\u2019ll commission a blacksmith to forge them.\u201dPreviously, Lu Sheng had found a strategic material resource distribution map for 300 years of martial arts in the Fireseed Repository. It was coming in handy now.\u201cIt\u2019s best to find dense iron or dense silver. Once the main material are ready, the other supplementary materials will be easy to procure. Moreover, if I find enough iron or silver, I can sell them for money. It\u2019s killing two birds with one stone.\u201dLu Sheng sorted out his thoughts and heaved a sigh of relief.At this moment, his sister Lu Qinghe\u2019s voice came from outside the door.\u201cComing.\u201dLu Sheng replied casually and got up to walk out of the door.\u2026A week later.At the door of the blending room in the Xingshan Tang. He Ling Su stood at the door, waiting anxiously, looking at her watch from time to time.After waiting for an unknown amount of time, the door of the blending room opened with a creak. He Ling Su immediately perked up and even straightened her back subconsciously.Lu Sheng\u2019s figure appeared at the door.Lu Sheng, dressed in a snow-white pharmacist\u2019s robe, stood tall and straight. His face was calm, and his increasingly handsome features set off by the pharmacist\u2019s robe gave off a calm, rigorous, and charming temperament.Although she knew that Lu Sheng was five years younger than her, He Ling Su was still in a trance and had a feeling of palpitating with excitement.\u201cDone?\u201d He Ling Su came back to her senses and quickly spoke to hide her slightly warm cheeks.\u201cYes.\u201dLu Sheng nodded and took off his gloves and pharmacist\u2019s robe.\u201cHow much did this batch of materials cost?\u201d\u201cAbout two hundred thousand.\u201d He Ling Su replied.Lu Sheng said lightly, \u201cRecord it first and deduct it from the profits later on.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d He Ling Su habitually responded in a docile tone. But she felt helpless in her heart.The sales of the new medicine hadn\u2019t started yet, and the profit had yet to be seen. In this week, she had already spent nearly a million on the advance payment for Lu Sheng.If it weren\u2019t for the other party\u2019s aura being too strong, which made her unable to even dare to say no, let alone resist. Moreover, she had successfully used the prescription to make the perfect Spirit Muscle Spiritual Muscle and Blood Strengthening Decoction. Otherwise, she would have rebelled long ago.Lu Sheng seemed to have seen through He Ling Su\u2019s emotions and casually comforted her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be going out in two days. If it goes well, the start-up funds for the Spiritual Muscle and Blood Strengthening Decoction should be available. When the time comes, I\u2019ll transfer them to you \u2026\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dHe Ling Su nodded obediently and didn\u2019t ask why Lu Sheng was going out.\u201cThen I\u2019ll head out first.\u201d Lu Sheng bid her goodbye and quickly left.He Ling Su didn\u2019t wait for Lu Sheng\u2019s figure to completely disappear. She took a deep breath and quickly rushed into the blending room.There was a faint medicinal aroma in the room.He Ling Su\u2019s eyes scanned the room like a radar. Soon, she locked onto a small bottle that had been used and hadn\u2019t been cleaned.He Ling Su almost jumped at the bottle with the medicinal residue. Some black powder was obviously left at the bottom of the completely transparent small vial.He Ling Su held up the vial as if she had found a treasure and carefully took out the black powder.Then she started a series of skilful operations.Analysis of medicinal properties, analysis of efficacy, pharmacological analysis \u2026 After half an hour, the results came out.He Ling Su raised her head in front of the instrument and said to herself with a complicated expression, \u201cSure enough, it\u2019s that mysterious medicine. He has been making this medicine, this week.\u201dThis mysterious medicine with black powder was the second treasure that He Ling Su found on Lu Sheng.And it was a huge treasure that far surpassed Spiritual Muscle and Blood Strengthening DecoctionAfter analysing the efficacy, He Ling Su found that the effect of this black powder medicine was several times stronger than Spiritual Muscle and Blood Strengthening Decoction.It had a lot less side effects, but was highly potent.Bone tempering!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Logging 10,000 Years into the FutureCH 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHe Ling Su was not a novice who had no understanding of martial arts. She knew very well that the third realm of martial arts, the main process was to temper the muscles and bones.In other words, this was a kind of supplement that was specially developed for Level 3 Martial Artists to temper their bones.At present, there were very few medicines and supplements on the market that targeted tempering bones. Even if there were, it would be Level 4 or 5 supplements.Not to mention the difference in effect with this black powder medicine. The difference in price was already big enough.Any Level 4 or 5 supplements would cost millions, even tens of millions.Ordinary people could not afford it at all.The cost of this new type of bone-tempering medicine in Lu Sheng\u2019s hands was much, much cheaper. Lu Sheng had made it for over a week and did not know how much he made.How many fake materials were mixed in the cost of the raw materials to confuse the public? The total cost was only about one million.The price-performance ratio was simply that of heaven and earth. However, until now, Lu Sheng wasn\u2019t willing to reveal any information about this new type of bone-tempering medicine.It was fine if he did not say, but the key was that he deliberately left a little bit behind every time. He deliberately lured He Ling Su to find it herself, causing her to feel like a cat was scratching her heart.He Ling Su was so angry.\u201cHe definitely did it on purpose!\u201d He Ling Su gritted her teeth and said.Lu Sheng clearly wanted to tell her that he had a lot of precious prescriptions in his hands. As long as she was obedient, there would be opportunities for cooperation in the future.It was not that He Ling Su did not think of secretly learning, but \u2026\u201cMiss He.\u201d Ma Fei walked in.\u201cAny gains?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dMa Fei shook his head helplessly. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching the surveillance footage the whole time, and it was turned off the whole time. Even if I get someone to fix it, it won\u2019t work. As soon as Lu Sheng left, everything returned to normal.\u201d\u201cSigh \u2026\u201d He Ling Su sighed and nodded. She waved her hand and signalled for him to get out.\u201cI knew this would happen.\u201dLu Sheng was a spiritual master, so he could easily nullify all of He Ling Su\u2019s tricks, making He Ling Su completely give up on the idea of secretly learning his secrets.\u201cForget it, I\u2019ll just follow him obediently. No matter what, there\u2019s hope for the He family to rise again \u2026\u201dHe Ling Su shook her head and threw the vial into the bin.\u2026\u201cA total of 93 Marrow Nourishing Pills should be sufficient for me to use for a while \u2026\u201dThis was the result of Lu Sheng\u2019s one week of hard work. In total, he had spent more than one million yuan. On average, the cost of each Marrow Nourishing Pill was only about ten thousand yuan.\u201cNext, I should prepare to go to Qiuming City \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng thought to himself.During this period of time, he had been looking at the resource distribution map every day. Combined with the current map of Dongning Province, he finally found a suitable location.It was a small silver reserve located in Qiuming City, a few hundred kilometres away from Baihe City. It was hidden deep in the mountains.Because it was located in a remote area, Lu Sheng guessed that it had not been discovered yet. There was a possibility he could monopolize it.When he got home, Lu Sheng booked the nearest high-speed train ticket from Baihe City to Qiuming City online. Then, he quickly packed his luggage and sent a message to each of his family members. He then embarked on the journey to Qiuming City alone.\u2026Qiuming City, on a mountain road.On the tour bus of a package named \u201cQiuming City Immortal Forest Village Three Days and Two Nights Tour\u201d, a young and beautiful female tour guide was enthusiastically introducing the itinerary and scenic spots to the tour group.\u201cImmortal Forest Village is located in the depths of Ox-Head Mountain. The place is beautiful, and it\u2019s far away from human habitation. It\u2019s one of the few Grade 5A scenic spots in Dongning Province.There, you can feel the warm and simple folk customs of the Immortal Forest Stockade, taste the unique traditional food of the Immortal Forest Stockade, appreciate the beautiful scenery of the Ox-Head Mountain, and even have the opportunity to buy the mysterious and exquisite traditional handicrafts of the Immortal Forest Village \u2026 \u201dThe female tour guide\u2019s saliva was flying around everywhere, but the tourists below were not interested at all.Only a few aunties wearing red travel hats listened attentively. From time to time, they would even ask a few questions.\u201cWill they force us to buy things again?\u201d\u201cWhere will we stay at night? Are there a lot of mosquitoes in the mountains?\u201d\u201cIs there a signal in the mountains? What if we meet a lion?I\u2019m afraid of wild animals the most.\u201dThe female tour guide patiently answered each of them.\u201cAunty, we are a conscientious travel agency. We will not force you to spend.\u201d\u201cAt night, we will all stay at the homestay in the village. The conditions are very good. There is air conditioning and a TV available.\u201d\u201cThere may be no signal in some places, but as long as we don\u2019t go in too deep, we can guarantee that the phone will carry a signal. Also, there are no lions in the mountains. Lions are in the grassland.\u201d\u201cThis is so boring. What\u2019s wrong with me accompanying you to this godforsaken place to relax?! There are still three days and two nights left. How am I supposed to endure it?!\u201dIn the back seat of the bus, a girl with silver earrings, sunglasses, and a tight purple short-sleeved shirt howled, venting her dissatisfaction.Sitting next to her was a beautiful girl with long straight black hair. She had a pretty face and a quiet temperament. She looked away from the scenery outside the window and said softly, \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to come. You insisted on coming.\u201dThe girl in sunglasses replied unhappily, \u201cPlease, it\u2019s because you\u2019re out of love. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll take things too hard and go deep into the mountains to commit suicide. I\u2019m worried about you, okay? Big sister, you\u2019re treating my kindness as malice!\u201d\u201cOkay, okay, okay. I know you\u2019re the kindest \u2026\u201dThe long-haired girl patted the hand of the girl in sunglasses and smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not that weak. It\u2019s just that I haven\u2019t been out for a long time. I\u2019m taking this opportunity to relax. This tour group is a little bad, but the scenery of the Ox-head Mountains is not bad. You won\u2019t regret it.\u201d\u201cYou\u00a0won\u2019t regret it.\u201dThe girl in sunglasses muttered, but her eyes unconsciously glanced to the side.There came the sound of a little girl\u2019s cheerful laughter. She seemed to be very happy. The long-haired girl followed her gaze and saw a middle-aged couple sitting in the back row of the bus.The man had a scholarly temperament, and the woman was gentle and virtuous. They were smiling at a little girl in a red dress in front of them.The little girl was playing a tossing game with a boy sitting on the right side of the second last row. The red plastic ball flew between the seats, making the little girl giggle non-stop.Feeling the long-haired girl\u2019s gaze, the husband of the middle-aged couple looked up at the girl.The middle-aged man\u2019s eyes seemed to contain some kind of powerful aura. With just one look, the long-haired girl felt inexplicably flustered and hurriedly lowered her head.When she looked up again, she found that the other party was no longer looking at her.The long-haired girl was a little surprised. She wasn\u2019t someone ignorant. She had only felt this kind of gaze from certain big shots.Looking at the attire of this family of three, she immediately secretly labelled them as \u201cnot ordinary\u201d in her heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She finally realized what her best friend had been secretly looking at.So that\u2019s why.\u201cI\u2019ll fetch it for you!\u201dAt this time, the girl in sunglasses who had been observing for a long time finally couldn\u2019t hold back the burning in her heart. She leaned back and reached out to catch the ball thrown by the handsome boy, and began to join the tossing game between the boy and the little girl.The long-haired girl shook her head in amusement.She turned her head and continued to stare at the scenery outside the window, no longer paying attention to this side.\u2026The bus wobbled on the mountain road for more than an hour before finally stopping in a rather lively mountain village.The group of people got off the bus one after another under the guidance of the female tour guide.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like much. Can this be considered a grade 5A scenic spot?\u201d The girl in sunglasses got off the bus and glanced at the colourful, neither modern nor ancient mountain village.The long-haired girl explained: \u201cThis is just where we\u2019ll stay. The places with good scenery are all in the mountains. You\u2019ll see when we enter the mountains tomorrow. I heard there\u2019s even a giant waterfall \u2026\u201d\u201cAs long as you like it.\u201dThe girl in sunglasses responded and immediately turned her head to look around.Not long after, a tall and handsome boy with a backpack and a suitcase came out of the bus. Behind the boy was a family of three with an extraordinary identity.The little girl obviously hadn\u2019t had enough of the ball tossing game. She ran over to the boy and held his hand as soon as she got out of the car. \u201cBig brother, can you play with Nannan again tomorrow?\u201dThe boy bent down and touched the little girl\u2019s head with a smile. He nodded and said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll play with you tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d The little girl nodded happily.At this time, the girl in sunglasses came up to the boy and said, \u201cBig sister will play with big brother with you tomorrow, okay?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dThe little girl made a face at the girl in sunglasses and said, \u201cBad sister, you always take Nannan\u2019s ball. Nannan doesn\u2019t want to play with you. Nannan only wants to play with big brother.\u201dThe girl in sunglasses\u2019 hand that was trying to touch the little girl\u2019s head suddenly froze. Her fair face was instantly filled with embarrassment.\u201cHaha \u2026\u201d The middle-aged couple was full of smiles and looked at the little girl dotingly.After saying goodbye to a few people, the family left.\u201cI don\u2019t want to play with you either, little brat \u2026\u201d The girl in sunglasses muttered in the direction of the family of three. Seeing the handsome boy standing alone, she rolled her eyes and pulled the long-haired girl\u2019s arm towards him.\u201cHey handsome, can we add each other as friends?\u201d The girl in sunglasses took out her phone and said to the boy with a smile.The handsome boy hesitated for a moment and nodded.\u201cOkay.\u201dSoon, the two added each other as friends on social media. Even the long-haired girl added them.\u201cLu \u2026 Sheng!\u201d The girl in sunglasses read it out loud and smiled. \u201cThe name\u2019s really domineering. Okay handsome, I won\u2019t bother you any more. See you later.\u201dThe boy nodded at the two and watched them leave.When the girl in sunglasses and the long-haired girl were far away, the smile on Lu Sheng\u2019s face disappeared little by little. His eyes gradually became sharp.In the span of a few breaths, his temperament changed from harmless to cold and unfathomable.\u201cInteresting, I can\u2019t believe I met a spiritual master here \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng looked in the direction of the departing middle-aged couple.Lu Sheng\u2019s destination was in the depths of the Ox-Head Mountains. Because he was unfamiliar with the place, and it was inconvenient to be alone, he simply signed up for a tour group to the Ox-Head Mountains. That was what led to the previous scene.What surprised Lu Sheng was that there were two official martial artists and a Level 2 Spiritual Master in this small tour group of less than 30 people.The two girls who had just added him as friends.The one wearing sunglasses was called Zheng Dandan, and the one with long, straight hair was called Lin Zishan. Both of them were official martial artists whose BQV exceeded 1.5.Especially Lin Zishan, who was a Level 2 Martial Artist.As for the little girl in the red dress who had been holding his hand, her father, the scholarly middle-aged man, was a rare Level 2 Spiritual Master.\u201cHowever, he shouldn\u2019t have discovered my identity. At best, he could only sense that I practice martial arts \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng was very confident about this.After forming the embryonic form of the Master\u2019s Will, Lu Sheng\u2019s Spiritual Energy was highly condensed and collapsed into the shape of a golden sun in his brain.As long as he didn\u2019t release it on his own accord, most people wouldn\u2019t be able to discover the fact that he had a strong spiritual strength.\u201cI don\u2019t care why these people came to Ox-Head Mountain, as long as they don\u2019t obstruct my goal, it\u2019s fine. If they really do \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng calmly muttered to himself, \u201cThen I\u2019ll just have to squash them to death.\u201dAs he spoke, Lu Sheng dragged his suitcase and walked in the direction of the mountain homestay.\u2026\u201cWow, the environment here isn\u2019t bad. I can even see the stream on the other side. Do you think I\u2019ll be able to smell the flowers when I wake up in the morning \u2026\u201dAs soon as Zheng Dandan entered the room, she immediately threw her suitcase aside, took off her sunglasses, and ran to the balcony, her face full of joy and happiness.\u201cWeren\u2019t you just complaining about how backward this place is?\u201d\u201cThat was then, now is now.\u201d Zheng Dandan picked up her phone and waved it around, giving Lin Zishan a \u201cyou know what I mean\u201d look.Lin Zishan was speechless. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s because the scenery is good. It\u2019s because someone\u2019s heart has sprouted.\u201d\u201cHeh, heh \u2026\u201d Zheng Dandan giggled. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find such a good looking guy these days, okay?\u201d\u201cYoung, handsome, good skin, good figure, kind and gentle. He\u2019s really the best little puppy.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say I\u2019m not being nice. We\u2019re best friends. If you like him, I\u2019ll let you have him.\u201dLin Zishan shook her head. \u201cForget it. I don\u2019t like guys with no temper. You can keep him.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll delete him from my friend list later \u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t. You don\u2019t like him, but I do.\u201dZheng Dandan cried. \u201cHe might be my boyfriend in the future. If you delete him from your friend list, I\u2019ll be so embarrassed \u2026\u201d\u201cSpeaking of which, you\u2019re still thinking about Chen Fei \u2026\u201d Zheng Dandan changed the topic and began to comfort Lin Zishan.\u201cIf you ask me, what\u2019s there to be sad about that kind of scumbag? He\u2019s just a little bit more talented in martial arts. He\u2019s not handsome, and he\u2019s a playboy who goes around picking up girls. He\u2019s far worse than my Lu Sheng \u2026 Also, you\u2019ve never even held his hand. What kind of boyfriend and girlfriend are you? What\u2019s there to be sad about? Maybe he doesn\u2019t even have you in his heart.\u201dLin Zishan\u2019s expression was lonely as she said nothing. She and Zheng Dandan were both students of Dongning University of Martial Arts.The Chen Fei that Zheng Dandan mentioned was the president of the university\u2019s student council. He was Lin Zishan\u2019s ex-boyfriend.Just as Zheng Dandan said, Chen Fei was talented in martial arts. He had a sweet mouth, knew how to coax girls, and knew how to create trouble. Thus, Lin Zishan, who was ignorant when she first entered university, was quickly tricked into becoming his girlfriend.However, because Lin Zishan\u2019s was conservative, Chen Fei gradually lost patience with her. By the time Lin Zishan realized that something was wrong, Chen Fei had already secretly changed girlfriends who knew how many times.That was why they came to Ox-Head Mountain to decompress.\u201cAlright, it\u2019s just men. There are plenty of them in the world. You\u2019re a beautiful Level 2 Martial Artist with a great body. Are you worried that you won\u2019t be able to get married in the future? Seize the moment and enjoy your youth.\u201dZheng Dandan patted Lin Zishan\u2019s shoulder, then took out her phone and happily opened a friend list. She sent a message.\u201cLittle brother, little brother, have you reached your room? (cute.jpg)\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLin Zishan watched her best friend\u2019s actions speechlessly. She turned to look at the scenery outside the window and suddenly felt that the current situation was pretty good.At least, the sadness of being heartbroken had washed away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This floor is uneven. Be careful not to fall.\u201d The middle-aged beautiful woman followed behind the little girl and exhorted with concern.Beside her, the scholarly middle-aged man walked into the room. A strange light flashed in his eyes. An invisible force spread out and instantly enveloped the entire room.A moment later, the light in the man\u2019s eyes disappeared, and he said, \u201cThere are no surveillance cameras or tracking devices. This room is very clean.\u201dThe beautiful woman coaxed the little girl to go to bed. She turned her head and said softly, \u201cYou\u2019re too cautious. No matter how powerful that Wu Xijing is in Baoding, can he extend his tentacles to this Ox-Head Mountain?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s never wrong to be careful with you and Nannan.\u201d The scholarly man said in a deep voice, \u201cDon\u2019t forget that we\u2019re running for our lives now.\u201d\u201cWu Xijing is a Level 3 Spiritual Master who has been famous for a long time. His nickname is \u201cDemonic Purple-Eyed Spider\u201d. He\u2019s a narrow-minded person who seeks revenge for the smallest grievance. If you offend him, you\u2019ll definitely face his wrath. I hope we can successfully escape his pursuit this time. As long as we hide in Immortal Forest Village for a year and a half, we should be fine.\u201cIf we\u2019re really careless and get caught by him, with your father here and us two Level 2 Spiritual Masters joining forces, we might be able to deal with him for a while. Of course, that\u2019s the worst outcome.\u201d\u201cSigh, I hope everything will go smoothly and safely.\u201d The beautiful woman sighed softly and said, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen my father in a long time. I don\u2019t know how his body is.\u201dThe scholarly man\u2019s eyes turned gentle. He took a step forward and gently hugged the beautiful woman. He comforted her softly, \u201cYour father\u2019s martial cultivation isn\u2019t weak. He\u2019s also a Level 2 Spiritual Master. Maybe he\u2019s already Level 3 by now. He\u2019s in the prime of his life. What problems can his body have \u2026 Don\u2019t worry, I definitely won\u2019t let you and Nannan get hurt.\u201dThe beautiful woman nodded and gently leaned on the scholarly man\u2019s chest. She felt slightly relieved.Not far away, the little girl in a red dress was standing on the bed. She was hugging a plastic ball and jumping around, giggling non-stop \u2026\u2026Lu Sheng walked into the room that the travel agency had arranged for him. He simply glanced around and didn\u2019t find anything unusual. He then put down his luggage.He tidied up a little and then sat on the bed. He took out a small glass vial from the pocket he carried with him. There were more than a dozen small pitch-black pills in the bottle.Lu Sheng poured one out and threw it into his mouth.He felt the Marrow Nourishing Pill melt in his body and turned into a stream of heat that rushed to his limbs and bones. Only then did he begin to practice the movements of the Stellar Body Refining Technique.This process continued until the sky turned completely dark.Only then did Lu Sheng stop.Lu Sheng felt that his BQV had increased. The progress of the Immortal Golden Body\u2019s refinement of his muscles and bones had also advanced a little. A satisfied smile appeared on his face.\u201cWith the help of the pills, it\u2019s indeed a lot faster. At this rate, I can estimate that I can completely complete the first stage of the Immortal Golden Body cultivation in less than two months. Generate inner strength, and officially step into the ranks of Level 4 Martial Artist \u2026\u201dLu Sheng went into the bathroom to take a shower. When he came out, he wiped his body with a towel and checked his phone. There were replies to all the messages he sent to his family.His dad, Lu Hai, and his mom, Zheng Yufen, reminded him as usual to be careful when he went out alone, to pay attention to the temperature, to change clothes, and to be careful not to get a stomachache.In their eyes, he, a Level 3 Martial Artist, still seemed to be just a child.His sister, Lu Qinghe, replied:\u00a0\u201cRunning out to play again, hmph!\u201dLu Sheng smiled and chose a \u201cproud\u201d emoji to reply.Lu Qinghe replied instantly.\u201cSenior Yang Yuan also came back to school today, and wanted to ask you out for dinner. Be honest, are you guys in love? (Curious)\u201dLu Sheng thought for a moment and replied: \u201cFocus on your own progress, don\u2019t worry about other someone else\u2019s business. Remember to take the supplements I left for you, every day. If your BQV hasn\u2019t broken through 1.3 by the time I come back, you can kill yourself to appease the world. (Dog head warning)\u201dAfter a while, Lu Qinghe replied with one word: \u201cTsk.\u201dLu Sheng shook his head and didn\u2019t reply.Before he left, he left Lu Qinghe twenty bottles of Spiritual Muscle and Blood Strengthening Decoction, plus the exotic beast meat in the fridge at home. In terms of cultivation conditions, Lu Qinghe wasn\u2019t worse than many second-generation rich kids.As long as she worked a little harder, her BQV would break 1.3. It wouldn\u2019t be hard.Then Zheng Dandan, who he just added during the day, sent him a bunch of messages.\u201cLittle brother, little brother, have you reached your room? (Cute)\u201d\u201cLittle brother, are you unpacking your things? (Cute)\u201d\u201cLittle brother Lu Sheng, can we go on the trip together tomorrow?\u00a0I\u2019m an official martial artist, I can protect you. (Proud)\u201d\u201cLittle brother, it\u2019s time to eat, do you want to eat together?\u201d\u201cLittle brother, little brother, why aren\u2019t you replying? Aren\u2019t you on your phone? (Crying)\u201d\u2026Lu Sheng stared at his phone for a few seconds and suddenly regretted adding her as a friend. He turned off his phone and didn\u2019t reply.Lu Sheng found a clean set of clothes to change into and walked out of his room.The tour group that Lu Sheng signed up for included food and accommodation, but it was already past meal time. If Lu Sheng wanted to eat, he had to pay for it.When Lu Sheng went downstairs, he saw some uncles and aunties from the tour group coming downstairs as well.Unlike him, they had already finished their meal and returned to their rooms to tidy up, ready to go out to the night market.Lu Sheng walked to the dining hall on the first floor of the guest house. He originally thought that he was the only one later late. He didn\u2019t expect to see the little girl\u2019s family, as well as Zheng Dandan and Yang Zishan sitting in the dining hall. Lu Sheng\u2019s appearance immediately attracted their attention.\u201cLu Sheng! This way!\u201d Zheng Dandan stood up and waved at him loudly, ignoring the gazes of others.\u201c\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng quietly found a seat nearby and sat down.This seat was not far from the little girl\u2019s family. The little girl\u2019s father smiled at Lu Sheng and nodded slightly.Lu Sheng nodded in response, then picked up the menu on the table and began to order.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit with us? The more, the merrier!\u201d Zheng Dandan pulled the helpless Lin Zishan over and sat down beside Lu Sheng as if they were close friends.Lu Sheng was puzzled. \u201cYou guys haven\u2019t eaten yet?\u201d\u201cNot yet!\u201d\u201cWe ate.\u201dThe two voices spoke at the same time. Zheng Dandan glared at Lin Zishan and smiled. \u201cI just didn\u2019t have an appetite and couldn\u2019t eat. Now that I\u2019m hungry, I\u2019ll eat with you!\u201d\u201cI see, feast for the eyes, but not for the wine.\u201d Lin Zishan said slowly.*[*Basically teasing her. Meaning that she\u2019s hungry, but not for food.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Do you want to try?\u201dBeside them, the little girl looked at Lu Sheng\u2019s table and raised her head to the middle-aged couple. \u201cDad, can I go find big brother to eat with me?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it the same if Nannan eats here?\u201d The beautiful woman patted the little girl\u2019s head and gently said.The little girl confidently said, \u201cNannan thinks that eating next to big brother will be more delicious.\u201dThe beautiful woman looked at her husband beside her.The elegant man smiled. \u201cLet her be. She won\u2019t leave our sight. What\u2019s there to worry about?\u201dSeeing that her husband agreed, the beautiful woman couldn\u2019t say anything else. She could only say, \u201cNannan, be good when you go over. Don\u2019t disturb big brother and big sister eating.\u201d\u201cNannan understands.\u201d The little girl picked up the plate and quickly ran over to Lu Sheng\u2019s table.Seeing that the little girl had successfully joined the table, the beautiful woman\u2019s eyes relaxed a little. She turned her head and complained to the elegant man. \u201cWhy did you let her go to a stranger\u2019s table for no reason?\u201dThe elegant man smiled. \u201cYou said I was too cautious. I think you\u2019re the one who\u2019s too cautious. If Nannan wants to eat with that young man, then let her be. That young man\u2019s character is not bad. His eyes are very pure. He can\u2019t be a bad person. And he\u2019s just a high school student. Even if he\u2019s practised martial arts for a few years, he can\u2019t be that strong. As long as he\u2019s within my sight, I can kill him with just a thought \u2026\u201dThe elegant man\u2019s expression was calm. His words revealed his strong confidence.The beautiful woman believed him. She knew that her husband was a powerful Level 2 Spiritual Master. Even though they were currently on the run, he was still not someone an ordinary martial artist could provoke.\u201cBut the other two \u2026\u201dThe elegant man\u2019s gaze gently fell on Lin Zishan. He said with interest, \u201cThe one with long hair seems to have noticed that I\u2019m not ordinary. But she\u2019s very smart and pretends not to know. The other one is the \u201cbig-breasted but brainless\u201d type. Her strength is average, she\u2019s only a Level 1 Martial Artist.\u201cAnyway, they\u2019re just ordinary people who can be easily dealt with. I\u2019ll look after Nannan, so you don\u2019t have to worry too much.\u201dThe beautiful woman nodded, completely relieved.\u201cAlright.\u201dThe elegant man patted the beautiful woman\u2019s hand and said softly, \u201cNow think about what gifts to buy for your father when we see him tomorrow.\u201dThe beautiful woman glared at him. \u201cNow you\u2019re thinking about buying a gift for my father? We\u2019re already in the mountains. What do you want to buy for him? Mountain goods? The village is in the mountains \u2026\u201dThe elegant man was stunned. Immediately, an awkward smile appeared on his face.\u201cRight, look at my brain \u2026 I forgot! I forgot! Hehe \u2026\u201d\u2026\u201cLittle brother, you\u2019re eating so much?\u201d Zheng Dandan stared with wide eyes at the table full of food Lu Sheng ordered. Her expression was a little surprised.Lu Sheng casually responded. Then, he gently said to Nannan who was sitting beside him, \u201cLet\u2019s see who can finish eating first, shall we?\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dNannan responded in a childish voice. She began to shovel food into her mouth \u2026Lu Sheng also began to eat quickly.Lin Zishan glanced at the table full of food. She couldn\u2019t help but look at Lu Sheng with a lighter gaze.Only people with average family conditions who haven\u2019t become official martial artists would eat so much in one meal.Generally, after a martial artist enters the ranks, they rely on supplements to replenish the energy they need for their daily cultivation.If they don\u2019t have the means, they\u2019ll choose higher quality ingredients instead. For example, she and Zheng Dandan carried synthetic compressed meat jerky with them.A Level 1 Martial Artist would be full after eating a few at a time. Otherwise, eating so much food every meal would take half a day to poop.But thinking that this little boy called Lu Sheng in front of her was still very young, Lin Zishan was relieved.Zheng Dandan didn\u2019t mind Lu Sheng eating too much. She kept her word and ate with Lu Sheng.Looking at the three of them wolfing down the food in front of her, Lin Zishan felt a little hungry. She wanted to eat more, but considering her ladylike image, she gave up.Staring at the three of them eating for a while, Lin Zishan couldn\u2019t help but sigh in her heart.To be honest, this boy called Lu Sheng\u2019s appearance was really impeccable. He could be said to be one in a million. His appearance, figure, and temperament were all outstanding. Even if it was just a meal, eating so much and eating so quickly was still pleasing to the eye.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that the only thing he has is his appearance \u2026\u201d Lin Zishan muttered in her heart. She couldn\u2019t help but think of her scumbag ex-boyfriend.Although he wasn\u2019t good-looking and had a terrible character, in other aspects, such as martial arts, he was undeniably brilliant \u2026\u201cI\u2019m full.\u201d Lu Sheng put down the cutlery and picked up the tissue beside him to wipe his mouth.\u201cNannan is also full.\u201d Nannan put down the plastic spoon in her hand and patted her round belly. She imitated Lu Sheng\u2019s way of speaking.\u201cBurp \u2026\u201d Zheng Dandan also wanted to say something, but when she opened her mouth, all that came out was a big burp.Her pretty face instantly turned red.To cover up her embarrassment, Zheng Dandan quickly changed the topic. She said to Lu Sheng, \u201cLittle brother, what are you going to do after eating?\u201d\u201cGo back to my room.\u201d Lu Sheng said calmly, \u201cWatch TV and then sleep.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go visit the mountain village? It\u2019s very lively and fun. I heard that there\u2019s a performance by the natives.\u201dZheng Dandan looked at Lu Sheng expectantly.Lin Zishan interrupted, \u201cWhen I asked you to go before, didn\u2019t you say that you\u2019d be bored to death? Saying that those villagers were all outsiders in disguise, blah blah blah.\u201dZheng Dandan continued to pretend that Lin Zishan didn\u2019t exist and continued to stare at Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng was thinking.Nannan raised her hand.\u201cNannan wants to see a performance.\u201dLu Sheng looked at Nannan and then at Lin Zishan. Finally, he nodded. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYay!\u201d Zheng Dandan jumped up excitedly.Lin Zishan was speechless.Her best friend was really hopeless.Immortal Forest Village was quite lively at night.Walking along the village gate hung with ribbons and red lanterns, there were stalls selling all kinds of snacks and handicrafts on both sides.Every stall had a small lantern hanging on it, and there was also a large group of natives wearing colourful clothes and silver jewellery singing and dancing on the road.Lu Sheng held Nannan\u2019s hand and wandered between the stalls, the elegant man and his wife following beside them. Behind them were Lin Zishan and Zheng Dandan strolling side by side.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve really fallen for this Lu Sheng?\u201d Lin Zishan asked Zheng Dandan beside her.Zheng Dandan stared at the outstanding and eye-catching figure in front of her, and casually replied, \u201cAm I not obvious enough?\u201dLin Zishan frowned. \u201cBut he\u2019s younger than us.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s only three or four years younger than us, and age isn\u2019t a problem. Little puppy, must be young.\u201d Zheng Dandan\u2019s eyes flashed, and she smiled.Lin Zishan turned to look at Zheng Dandan carefully and said, \u201cAre you serious?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
