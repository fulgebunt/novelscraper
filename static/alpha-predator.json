For example, Shen Dai never imagined that one day, he would be invited into this house. After all, he had once been thrown out like garbage.In his childhood impression, it was a splendid \u201cpalace\u201d. It was so big, so bright, and came with a curved spiral staircase that didn\u2019t care at all about wasting living space. For the first time, he knew that the staircase could be placed inside the house. He had stood in such a house. Raising his head, he would be worried that the huge crystal chandelier might fall from the top of his head. And lowering his head, he would be afraid of soiling the bright floor.20 years later, he came here again. It is still located in the quiet center of the land with astonishing prices. However, the community has been here for quite some time, thus the style and design concept of this villa are outdated. Its exterior wall has been refurbished and changed to the French-style stone that has been fashionable in recent years. The flowers and plants are also meticulously taken care of in order to maintain their state. But the dried-up fish pond, the stone steps, and flower beds in the courtyard all have mottled traces from the wind and rain. Although it is still expensive and stylish at first glance, it already could no longer bear the weight of details.Those rumors circulating on the Internet aren\u2019t groundless and the depressing stock price cannot deceive people, the You family might really be finished.He came here twice, both times involuntarily. Today, he was half \u201cinvited\u201d inside the car by the bodyguard.Since he was so impressed with this house back then, his memories about his biological father are blurry. But he was definitely not as old as he is now. This man used to be a high-profile heir of a large business conglomerate, an Alpha with A-level pheromone. He graduated from a prestigious school, was young and handsome, and married a well-matched wife.Frustrations are melted into a person\u2019s spirit and then engraved within the textures on the face, unable to be hidden.Shen Dai stood in front of You Xinghai and silently seized him up in response to You Xinghai seizing him up.You Xinghai had a sullen expression on his face. As an alpha and with the dignity of the patriarch, Shen Dai\u2019s calm gaze made him feel uncomfortable. He was already prepared. He imagined that Shen Dai would denounce him, tell him all his misfortunes, or at least express obvious hatred. But the young man in front of him was too calm.Not long after he was forced to make that decision, all of this child\u2019s information appeared on the office desk \u2013 Shen Dai, 27 years old, omega male, single, Master in Materials Engineering at HKUST(1), working at Xingzhou Group\u2019s Rare Earth-Elements Research Institute, family members includes his omega father and his grandmother.1) HKUST: Hong Kong University of Science and TechnologyThe shy and fearful little boy twenty years ago has become a calm adult. Thinking of his background and the demands he might make, You Xinghai couldn\u2019t help but feel a little guilty.Shen Dai looked around, found a chair, and sat down. Then he took out his mobile phone and replied to a few work messages.You Xinghai frowned and cleared his throat.Shen Dai raised his head and said neither humbly nor arrogantly, \u201cPresident You, what are you looking for from me?\u201d\u201c\u2026You have grown up.\u201d You Xinghai had many experiences through thick and thin, he has been through the ups and downs of a business, but at this time, he can only use small-talk to ease the awkwardness.Shen Dai wanted to laugh a little, \u201cPresident You, if you don\u2019t have something to beg from me, it\u2019s impossible for you to take the initiative to come find me, just say it.\u201d Usually, this kind of drama plot where a scumbag father actively seeks out an illegitimate child he avoided after many years, it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t have any other offspring. However, that\u2019s not the case with the You family. If something happened to the young master of the You family, it\u2019s impossible for it to not get onto the news.You Xinghai almost couldn\u2019t hold his expression together, \u201cBeg\u00a0isn\u2019t really necessary, I want to make a deal with you.\u201d\u201cSay it.\u201d The reason why Shen Dai got into the car was mainly out of curiosity. In this society ruled by law and it\u2019s not like they\u2019re filming a movie, if he screamed out loud on the street, the bodyguards wouldn\u2019t dare to do anything to him. He came here simply because he wanted to know what You Xinghai wanted from him. Maybe he could reap some thrill of getting revenge.You Xinghai tapped on the folder in front of him, \u201cYou have a debt, seven million. This isn\u2019t a small amount.\u201d\u201cYeah, does President You want to help me pay it?\u201d Shen Dai revealed a sarcastic smile.\u201cI can help you pay it.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s pupils shrank fiercely, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cMy son originally had a very important engagement, but now he can\u2019t fulfill it. I need you to return to the You family register and get married for him.\u201dThis sentence was too much like the plot of a drama, it was beyond absurdity and too nonsensical. Shen Dai took five seconds to react, \u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s my status? Why would I joke around with you.\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t he get married?\u201dYou Xinghai\u2019s expression became hazy in an instant. It seemed difficult for him to force out, \u201cHe was marked by someone else.\u201dShen Dai became silent. He did debate in his heart, marrying a stranger sounded shitty, but could it be worse than carrying a huge debt? His life and the years of his grandmother\u2019s old age were oppressed by this debt to the point of no hope. If he could climb out of the quagmire by paying some price, why not take a gamble.Shen Dai took a deep breath, \u201cMarriage, what are the requirements?\u201d\u201cWhat the requirements are depends on your future husband. Whatever he asks of you, you will do so.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s slender eyelashes trembled in fast motion. It seemed that he didn\u2019t have too much hesitation, he slowly raised his eyes and looked at You Xinghai, \u201cI want ten million.\u201dYou Xinghai narrowed his eyes, not surprised, but also obviously displeased.If what You Xinghai said is the truth, then his increased price will definitely be accepted. The so-called very important marriage contract must be related to the fate of the company and the rise and fall of the family. Only so, would he bring out his only precious omega son. However, You Baiyue was marked by someone else in the end. This is a great shame for both the You family and the party of the marriage. Marks can be removed, but the bite marks left on the glands cannot be erased by the current medical science. Which rich family can accept such humiliation? This marriage had to be called off.Shen Dai thought of You Baiyue\u2019s delicate and beautiful face that is active on social media. He clearly looked very smart, so how did he tumble down like this? One of the most absurd mistakes an omega can make at a young age is being marked before getting married. However, thinking of it in another way, what if You Baiyue deliberately uses this method to resist marriage? Such as if the other party is old, ugly, disabled, has weird quirks, or has violent tendencies? These risks are all entirely possible.He was brought here to save the show, even if the You family\u2019s stock price has been cut in half, it\u2019s not to the extent that they\u2019re unable to bring out 10 million.Sure enough, You Xinghai simply said, \u201cFine.\u201dShen Dai regretted it very much, he regretted that he asked for too little. He\u2019s still lacking some courage and insight. Although he still doubts the credibility of this matter, he hopes it\u2019s true. Repaying his debt is his current most urgent desire.He stood up, \u201cThen it\u2019s settled. You can arrange whatever comes next. I have to go back to work, I\u2019m leaving first.\u201dYou Xinghai looked at him in surprise, \u201cYou have no other questions?\u201d\u201cNo, as long as you really give me the money.\u201d\u201c\u2026Aren\u2019t you gonna ask who your future alpha husband is?\u201dShen Dai lowered his head and glanced at his phone. It was only a short while, yet there were already a bunch of messages. He didn\u2019t look back and said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dHe is burdened with debt at such a young age. His future is uncertain and has long lost any expectations and fantasies towards marriage and love in this lifetime. Therefore, even if the other party may be so bad that You Baiyue had to resist marriage in the most extreme way, as long as he can get his house back and let his grandma live well in old age, it\u2019s just selling himself, he\u2019ll concede to it.It doesn\u2019t matter who it is.After leaving the You house, Shen Dai went straight to the research institute. Although they have more freedom in regards to time and don\u2019t need to punch in, it\u2019s not exactly good to be absent from work in the morning for no reason.Right after graduating from university, he joined the Xingzhou Group through the Talent Plan program. Because his mentor is the person in charge of one of the projects of the Rare Earth-Elements Research Institute, his graduate courses are all basically completed in the laboratory. Actually, his salary is high among his peers, but he only feels far and hopeless facing his debt of seven million.He had seriously thought about it before. If he wants to turn his life around, it can only happen if, one, money falls from the sky, or two, he obtains a patent. As a gender who is neither superior in the workplace nor at scientific research, nor does he have a top-notch genius brain, he had already preset a decade or two of struggles for the second option. But he did not expect that the effortless former option had become a reality instead. Thinking of how he believed in \u201ceducation changes fate\u201d since childhood, it really is too ironic.\u201cShixiong(2).\u201d2) shixiong: senior brother\u201cShixiong, morning.\u201d\u201cMorning.\u201dAs soon as he entered the research institute, his shidis(3)\u00a0and shimeis(4)\u00a0greeted him one after another.3) shidi: junior brother4) shimei: junior sister\u201cMorning my ass, you can go straight to lunch after some tidying.\u201d A mocking voice sounded from behind, \u201cShen Dai, it\u2019s rare for you to be late.\u201dThis is his university classmate Cheng Zimei, a female beta. The two have been friends for many years and are comrades-in-arms who share many common academic ideals.\u201cI have something last-minute to do, is laoshi(5)\u00a0here today?\u201d Shen Dai put on his lab coat and poured himself a glass of water.5) laoshi: teacher\u201cNo, do you want to look at the batch of materials just sent by Wansheng Mine?\u201dShen Dai looked at his watch, \u201cI\u2019ll look at it in the afternoon, let\u2019s go eat first.\u201dThe Rare Earth-Elements Research Institute has its own canteen, but they took a few more steps today to eat in the large canteen of the company\u2019s headquarters. The food from both sides are purchased together and it tastes great at both places, but there is naturally more selection in the larger canteen. They frequently switch places to eat.The two got their meal and then ate while chatting.At this moment, he heard a small commotion at the entrance. Shen Dai looked back and saw a group of people in suits and leather shoes filed in, walking in a hurry. The lunch break is usually a time when social animals are more relaxed, so they don\u2019t look like they came here to eat, they look like they\u2019re here for an inspection.The cafeteria was very large, and from Shen Dai\u2019s distance, he could hardly see their faces. But he still accurately captured one superior height and beautiful silhouette at a glance.\u201cWhy did the Crown Prince come to eat at the staff cafeteria today?\u201d Cheng Zimei held her chopsticks in her mouth and stretched her neck over to look.Shen Dai\u2019s eyes silently followed the tall man who was surrounded by a group of people. He worked hard to get a few complete but unclear faces from the moving heads until the other passed through the cafeteria and entered the private room. He couldn\u2019t smell his pheromones at such a distance, but Shen Dai still felt a bit restless.Cheng Zimei answered herself, \u201cMaybe he\u2019s busy and invited the client to a work meal.\u201dShen Dai has strong observation skills. He noticed that mostly omegas paid special attention to those people just now. It can\u2019t be helped. Omegas are creatures that engrave yearning into their genetic instincts, even Shen Dai himself can\u2019t be exempt from the custom. An S-class Alpha walked by with the wind, leaving a faint trace of pheromones in the air, making people fall into reveries.What\u2019s more, as the first heir of Xingzhou Group, Qu Moyu is an alpha with halos all over his body.snaggletooth: Hello!

    "Chapter 2": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter finishing a batch of experimental data, Shen Dai got off work early.He has a single-room dormitory in the research institute, he usually sleeps there if he works late overtime. However, he tries his best to return home every week.After the mortgage of his family\u2019s house was auctioned off, he rented a small apartment for his grandmother in the suburbs. Although it was very remote, it was cheap and clean, his grandma valued cleanliness the most.He took the subway and then transferred onto the bus. On the way home, he passed a small market that was about to close. He bought some meat and vegetables, as well as a handful of pinkish-purple peonies. Its petals are thin and delicate, clustered together in layers and showing its strong vitality.In their old house, his grandma would raise all kinds of flowers in the yard. Each of the four seasons had its sproutings, that was his childhood paradise. Now that they moved into a small apartment, only a few pots could be planted on the balcony. Those few pots even had to compete for space among many other miscellaneous things.The apartment is new, the overall maintenance is acceptable and the lights in the corridor are warm. As Shen Dai climbed up the stairs to the house, he could hear the sound of the TV gradually becoming louder. It played grandma\u2019s favorite\u00a0Kunqu. When he opened the door, the smell of the food floated into his nose, which immediately relaxed him.\u201cAh-Dai?\u201d Grandma peeked her head from the frosty glass door of the kitchen and said with a smile, \u201cYou\u2019re really good at arriving at the right time. I\u2019m almost done making my last dish.\u201dShen Dai revealed a gentle smile and called out, \u201cGrandma.\u201d He put down the ingredients, took a vase, and rinsed it with clean water. Then he obliquely cut the branches of peonies and put them in. He picked up some water with his hand and sprinkled it on the delicate petals before putting it on the table. It immediately enriched the atmosphere of the whole house.Grandma came out of the kitchen with a dish, \u201cHow much was it?\u201d She put down the dish and freed her hand to tease the petals, \u201cIt\u2019s so fresh, very beautiful.\u201d\u201cThe stall was about to close, so this handful was only 10 yuan. I picked out the freshest ones.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty good deal.\u201d Grandma looked at the flower lovingly, \u201cDo you remember that I used to plant peonies near the East Wall?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Shen Dai went to the kitchen and brought out all the dishes one by one. He also brought out the bowls and chopsticks and served the rice and soup, \u201cGrandma, sit down.\u201dGrandma looked at the flowers with a smile and then looked at Shen Dai, \u201cYou seem paler. You should bask in the sun more, don\u2019t stay in the lab all day.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will.\u201dWhile eating, they chatted about trivial matters in life and work. Looking at his grandma\u2019s shimmering white sideburns under the light, Shen Dai felt sorrowful.Grandma was born into a scholarly family. Although it wasn\u2019t of high status or nobility, it was still considered well-off. If she had not unfortunately given birth to a selfish and stupid son, she would now be in a small villa with a garden, guarding a considerable amount of inheritance and pension. She would be planting flowers, reading books, basking in the sun, and enjoying the rest of her life.We\u2019re sorry for MTLers or people who like using reading mode, but our translations keep getting stolen by aggregators so we\u2019re going to bring back the copy protection. If you need to MTL please retype the gibberish parts.Even after falling into this state, she still kept her elegance and tactfulness. She looked for the endearing qualities and pleasure of life in these difficult day while trying not to drag her grandson down. However, Shen Dai knew that her heart had already been pierced full of holes by her own son\u2019s betrayal, the changes in her life, and the pain coming from her body. It\u2019s just that she refused to show it in front of him.Po ktja Tbe Wlcutjl rjlv kjr agef, atfc tf mbeivc\u2019a kjla ab rjmglolmf tlwrfio.

An inquisitive colleague from HR came to find him and told him that the headquarters asked him to come over, \u201d Engineer Shen, are you transferring?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Shen Dai was also puzzled. \u201cDid they say what it was about?\u201d\u201cOf course not, why would I ask you otherwise?\u201d The colleague pondered, \u201cThe headquarters generally don\u2019t care much about the matters of our research institute. Just go first, someone is picking you up at the front desk.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Shen Dai went back to the laboratory and greeted his colleagues before going straight to headquarters. He hesitated on whether to call and ask his laoshi, but decided to check out the situation first.The headquarters of Xingzhou Group cost 500 million yuan to build, it could really hold up the sky. Most of the time, Shen Dai came here for the canteen. He rarely ever set foot in the offices or scientific research areas.He walked into the lobby and saw three or four people standing at the front desk. He couldn\u2019t tell who was waiting for him. However, as soon as he walked over, a young man dressed in a suit and leather shoes greeted him, \u201cEngineer Shen, right? Hello.\u201d\u201cHello.\u201d The two shook hands. Shen Dai said, \u201cHow should I call you?\u201d\u201cMy name is Cheng Ruoze, I\u2019m the president\u2019s assistant.\u201d He made a \u201cplease go ahead\u201d gesture and casually took Shen Dai\u2019s shoulder as he strode forward. He looked like he was in a hurry. \u201cLet\u2019s walk while talking.\u201d\u201cUh, okay.\u201d Alphas were generally tall, so Shen Dai had to quicken his pace to catch up with him, \u201cAssistant Cheng, may I ask if I\u2019m\u2026\u201d\u201cThis way.\u201d Cheng Ruoze used his employee card to open an elevator.The grandiose interior of the elevator was covered with a thick wool carpet. It can be seen that it\u2019s an internal elevator for the superiors at first glance. Shen Dai walked in with uncertainty and wanted to ask again, but was interrupted by Cheng Ruoze, \u201cActually, I don\u2019t know the specific situation either. I was just ordered to pick you up.\u201dShen Dai frowned, he has no idea what he was about to face. Science researchers like them usually grasp some bits of inspiration or follow traces of clues before judging, experimenting, and exploring. But here, he wasn\u2019t given any hints at all, he really couldn\u2019t figure it out.From the corner of his eyes, Cheng Ruoze suddenly caught sight of the pheromone sticker on the gland behind Shen Dai\u2019s neck. He was obviously stunned and unconsciously withdrew half a step to the side. \u201cYou\u2019re an\u2026 omega?\u201dShen Dai smiled and nodded.\u201cMy apologies.\u201d Cheng Ruoze apologized awkwardly. He secretly sized up Shen Dai from top to bottom for another take. The young man in front of him was tall and slender, and his skin looked clean and pale. He let out a gentle yet handsome impression. The lab coat he was wearing just happened to nicely highlight the outline of his body. His straight shoulder and waist rested nicely under the cloth, if they were one bit thicker, it would look excessive, if one bit thinner, it would look too frail. His temperament was the same as his appearance and the impression he gave people was just right, if one bit more, he would appear cold, if one bit less, he would appear common. As the elevator soared, Cheng Ruoze felt his heartbeat becoming a little unruly. Why has he never heard that there was such an omega at their company before?Based on the normal social etiquette between strangers, alpha and omega should not touch more than shaking hands. It was inappropriate just now when Cheng Ruoze put his hand on the other\u2019s shoulder. However, Shen Dai did not feel offended, he knew that his appearance was not as delicate and soft as most omega, he knew that he was more like a beta. Moreover, his pheromone is usually very faint, it hardly left a scent after putting on barrier stickers. He was mistaken for beta countless times growing up. In fact, it\u2019s actually good for him, especially at work.The elevator rose to the 28th floor. As soon as the door opened, a gorgeous handmade carpet extending to an office with an ebony door could be seen.Shen Dai took a deep breath, \u201cIt was Director Qu who wanted to see me?\u201d Was he about to be promoted? But he hasn\u2019t produced much results lately.Cheng Ruoze came back to his senses: \u201cThis way, please.\u201dShen Dai followed him into the office. When he saw the person in the room, he was stunned. Ebony door\u2026 how did he not think of it before? He unconsciously put his hands into the pocket of his lab coat. People around him always say that he\u2019s\u00a0just like his name. They praised him with words such as calm, cool-headed, steady, and the like. However, he himself doesn\u2019t think he has any special calming skills. He only thinks that people should use their brains more and emotions less, but that doesn\u2019t mean he will not be nervous.\u201cPresident Qu, I\u2019ve bought Engineer Shen here.\u201d Cheng Ruoze looked at his watch. \u201cThe meeting will begin in twelve minutes.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dWhen Cheng Ruoze left and closed the door, the person sitting on the sofa reading documents raised his head. Two pairs of eyes met through a collision in the air.It was a handsome man who could light up the whole space. He can seamlessly integrate into any background and turn it into a scene of a movie. His face is of infinite fantasies, he has an upright nose and a broad forehead, his eyes contain the entire galaxy, and his facial features are as sharp and perfect as a knife. He sat in a relaxed posture on the soft sofa but still had the aura of a sword. It\u2019s just that he collected and restrained himself, it was as if he was the calm sea, yet no one dared to underestimate the surging undercurrent beneath. This is because he is a S-class alpha. He is the proud son of the heavens who was born with the top pheromones and stood at the top of the human food chain.He is the first heir of Xingzhou Group \u2014\u2014 Qu Moyu.Shen Dai stared at Qu Moyu in a daze. He hasn\u2019t looked at this person from such a close distance for a long time now. It seemed as if he could still smell the scent of ebony from his memories. Of course, this is probably his illusion. It is basic etiquette to put on pheromone barrier stickers in public places. When it\u2019s on, the faint scent could only be smelled at a close social distance, and Shen Dai is still pestering at the door.He calmed down as soon as possible and noticed that there was actually someone else in the room. A middle-aged alpha with glasses sitting on the other side of the sofa, looking like he was waiting for an order. Shen Dai knows this person, he belongs to the legal department of the company. He\u2019s not sure about the specific position but he must definitely be an executive.Qu Moyu sized up Shen Dai without hesitation. His eyes were calm but unfathomable, he smiled, \u201cEngineer Shen, come sit.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple moved. He walked over and bowed slightly, \u201cHello, President Qu.\u201d Only after nodding to that executive as well, did he finally sit down.He glanced over and found that the documents in Qu Moyu\u2019s hand were his own personnel file, with his two-inch photo pasted on it. Why was Qu Moyu looking for him?\u201cShen Dai.\u201d Qu Moyu tapped his information file with his slender fingers, enunciating his name clearly, \u201cDai refers to\u00a0Mount Tai\u00a0right?.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a nice name. Who gave it to you?\u201d\u201cMy grandpa.\u201d Shen Dai felt an upsurge of emotion. \u201cHe is a traditional Chinese painter and likes painting mountains.\u201d\u201cMount Tai is known as the first of the Five Sacred Mountains and it\u2019s the place where ancient emperors held grand ceremonies to worship the heavens for prosperities. Such a meaningful word, it seems that the old man has high hopes for you.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine an omega carrying such a rich name, but strangely, Qu Moyu felt that this name was very suitable for the person in front of him.Shen Dai smiled, embarrassed, \u201cMaybe he just likes Mount Tai.\u201dQu Moyu stared at Shen Dai, \u201cThe \u2018accident\u2019 in the laboratory three years ago didn\u2019t have any undesirable impact on your work, did it?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s been fine.\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s face suddenly burned, \u201cY-you still remember.\u201d\u201cI have a good memory.\u201d\u201cThat time\u2026 thank you for helping me, President Qu.\u201d Shen Dai will never forget that day. At the most shameful, fearful, and desperate moment of his life, Qu Moyu descended from the sky. He not only saved him, but also blocked the news from getting out and settled all other troubles after that. Recalling the day after the trauma, his most profound memory was actually the entanglement of their rich pheromones, the desire, the scorching hotness, the impulsiveness, the torture, the restraint, and the unsatisfied eagerness that slowly precipitated in the bottom of his heart.Since then, whenever he saw or heard of Qu Moyu, he would pay special attention. He didn\u2019t know whether this counted as a secret crush but he occasionally had some unrealistic fantasies. Though it\u2019s more admiration than anything else, because this person was too high, too far, and too perfect. He never thought he would get another chance to be at such a close distance after that accident.\u201cYou are an excellent researcher of our company, it is expected of me to help.\u201d Qu Moyu said, \u201cI asked you to come here today because first, I want to formally get to know you, and second, I want to know if you have any requests.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Requests?\u201d Shen Dai didn\u2019t understand. \u201cPresident Qu, I don\u2019t quite understand. Laoshi hadn\u2019t mentioned anything to me recently.\u201dQu Moyu raised his eyebrows slightly, \u201cWhat I mean is, after marriage. You can put forward whatever requests you may have, such as living expenses, living environment, personal habits, diet habits, beliefs, car preference, and so forth, as long as it\u2019s not overboard.\u201dShen Dai only heard a buzz inside his head. He\u2019s not stupid, he could even be called smart, but he couldn\u2019t react to these words for a long time.Qu Moyu quickly glimpsed at his wristwatch. He leaned slightly, while he didn\u2019t look impatient, he lowered his tone, \u201cEngineer Shen, President You said that you had personally agreed to marry me. Is there an error in our information?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The person in front of him seemed far yet near, hazy yet clear. His brain froze and he suddenly lost the ability to think. All his emotions disappeared in an instant. He only felt unreal, extremely unreal.Qu Moyu remained calm and composed as he looked at him.Shen Dai put his hands into his pockets and lightly clenched them into fists. After settling for a while, he said, \u201cWe\u2026 I didn\u2019t know it was\u2026 you.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t know it was me.\u201d Qu Moyu repeated it once, and the corners of his lips slightly curled up.Shen Dai wanted to hide himself due to embarrassment. It really sounded unbelievable, even he himself wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u201cHave I let you down?\u201d\u201cNo, no.\u201d Shen Dai hurriedly said.\u201cThen, let\u2019s get back to the point.\u201d Qu Moyu said, \u201cWhat requests do you have after marriage?\u201dShen Dai breathed slowly, \u201cWhat requests do you have?\u201d\u201cThis cooperation will be beneficial to both of us. I need you to sign some agreements before marriage to clarify the ownership of property and various rights. After marriage, you can just be a normal wife. You have to stay confidential, low-key, loyal, and know your boundaries.\u201d Qu Moyu spoke quickly and fluently. It was obvious that these words were thoroughly prepared for this moment.Shen Dai nodded.\u201cThe more specific terms, Lawyer Chen will communicate them with you.\u201d Qu Moyu finally took a glance at the person in charge of legal affairs beside him.Lawyer Chen smiled and nodded.\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cSo, what are your requests? I will provide you with the living conditions suitable of my wife. You don\u2019t have to feel bad, you deserve it. You can also moderately change your future residence according to your habits. Do you have any thoughts on what I mentioned just now?\u201dShen Dai noticed that Qu Moyu quickly glanced at his watch again. Sitting here face to face with the one he will soon become legal partners with, he was disappointed to realize that his spiritual world was shaken by such sudden news and his whole life will soon undergo unpredictable changes, that in this destiny of raging storms, his suppressed calmness was his only defense against the unknown. Yet for Qu Moyu, this matter was only worth the brief gap between his lunch break and a meeting, handled quick and simple like everyday work.We\u2019re sorry for MTLers or people who like using reading mode, but our translations keep getting stolen by aggregators so we\u2019re going to bring back the copy protection.

As an omega, it really takes courage to make eye contact with a top-tier alpha, just like a small herbivore looking at a large carnivore, even when the other had no intentions to attack. He asked, \u201cPresident Qu, where will I be staying? Is it far from the company?\u201dQu Moyu was a bit surprised, \u201cYou still want to continue working?\u201d\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t continue working?\u201d Shen Dai hesitated, this job is not only a good job, but also his ideal job. If this is the price that needs to be paid, it\u2019s too much.\u201cOf course you can, losing an excellent employee like you is the loss of the company.\u201dShen Dai immediately breathed a sigh of relief.\u201cEngineer Shen, you can talk about the legal issues and the course of matters with Lawyer Chen in detail. You can also put forward any questions and demands you may have. I have something else to do. Excuse me first.\u201d He said as he stood up.\u201cYes, President Qu.\u201d Shen Dai also stood up.Qu Moyu is too tall, he is considered tall even among the generally tall alphas. He was like a wall, casting a shadow on Shen Dai. Shen Dai looked up at the man in front of him. The sense of oppression that hasn\u2019t dissipated since entering the room became heavier, even though he clearly looked polite and peaceful.Although alphas are common in real life, S-level alphas are rare. The pheromone suppression of S-level alphas is extremely terrifying. It\u2019s like holding a heavy weapon, it can defeat both a person\u2019s physical and psychological aspects. It is even prohibited by the law for personal injuries. Although he hasn\u2019t seen it, he has heard of it. Facing others with a gentle attitude is Qu Moyu\u2019s accomplishment as a superior, it made Shen Dai have a good feeling toward him.Qu Moyu walked away leisurely and left, Shen Dai let out a breath.Lawyer Chen said politely, \u201cEngineer Shen, please sit down. We still have many details to discuss.\u201d As he spoke, he took out a thick stack of documents from his briefcase.Shen Dai took a glance, \u201cThis is the prenuptial agreement, right?\u201d\u201cPrenuptial agreement is the more relatively general term. This contract not only covers assets, but also confidentiality regulations, reputation, rights and obligations after marriage, and so forth. Of course, as president Qu said, these are our requests, you can also put forward your requests, and I will be responsible for the communication and negotiation.\u201dShen Dai picked up the contract and flipped through it, \u201cIt\u2019s too thick.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. You can read it carefully. I\u2019ll be here to accompany you. This is your right, but you can\u2019t take this contract out of this office before signing it.\u201d Lawyer Chen said, \u201cOf course, if you don\u2019t want to look at it, I can briefly summarize the key points for you.\u201d\u201cPlease.\u201d\u201cThe maximum duration of this marriage will not exceed five years, and President Qu will decide when it ends. You must keep this marriage completely confidential. During the marriage and after the marriage, any secrets you may find about President Qu and the Qu family must also be kept. During the marriage, you must fulfill your obligations as a wife. As President Qu said, you must stay confidential, low-key, loyal and, know your boundaries. The so-called boundaries mean that you must obey President Qu\u2019s orders as much as possible and cannot interfere with President Qu\u2019s private life and official business. In regards to lifestyle, President Qu\u2019s housekeeper will follow up with you later. In addition, you may need to cooperate with You Xinghai and President Qu to handle the transfer of some resources. The biggest purpose of this marriage is to integrate the resources of the two companies. The blood bond between you and You Xinghai is the foundation of President Qu\u2019s trust. President Qu\u2019s premarital properties and properties created during this marriage will have nothing to do with you. You cannot conceive president Qu\u2019s offspring without authorization. However, after the marriage ends, President Qu will give you additional compensation. As long as you abide by these agreements, you will get the freedom and respect you deserve as well as a considerable amount of alimony. \u201dShen Dai calmly looked at Lawyer Chen as he talked with ease and fluency. His professionalism and logic were impeccable, but he felt his body turning cold. He isn\u2019t an idealist, but he also can\u2019t treat marriage as a completely utilitarian transaction. Right, his marriage is a transaction, but he doesn\u2019t think marriage should be like this, it\u2019s just that he doesn\u2019t have any better choice. No matter if it were You Xinghai, Qu Moyu, or the person in front of him, they all think this as it should be.Shen Dai interrupted him, \u201cI agree to it all. I won\u2019t waste your time, let\u2019s just sign.\u201dLawyer Chen, with a symbolic smile, was not surprised, \u201cOkay.\u201d He handed the pen to Shen Dai, \u201cYour signature and fingerprint are needed in all the places with sticky tabs.\u201dShen Dai buried himself in signing. He thought of how he was signing the contract to sell himself off. If it wasn\u2019t inappropriate, he might want to laugh.After signing, Lawyer Chen checked patiently and carefully twice, \u201cThank you for your cooperation.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Then I\u2019ll go back.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you have any requests?\u201d Lawyer Chen put down his standard professional tone and brought out a hint of advice, \u201cPresident Qu said that you can ask for a more decent life and put forward some reasonable demands.\u201d\u201cAs long as I don\u2019t owe people money, my life will be decent enough. Thank you.\u201d Shen Dai gave his regard by nodding and left unhurriedly.As soon as he returned to the laboratory, everyone stopped the work on their hands and simultaneously looked at Shen Dai.Shen Dai laughed, \u201cDon\u2019t gossip, it was nothing.\u201dShen Dai is the one with the most seniority here. When the experimental group was just established, he was brought in by his laoshi and has a lot of prestige. So if he didn\u2019t want to say, no one dares to gossip. This is Shen Dai\u2019s favorite part of the academic circle. Rather than gender, qualifications and achievements are more important here.However, Cheng Zimei is different. They were classmates and could talk about almost anything. Apart from their laoshi, only Cheng Zimei knows about Shen Dai\u2019s debt.As soon as Shen Dai sat down, Cheng Zimei slid her chair over to him and said in a low voice, \u201cWhat\u2019s the situation?\u201dShen Dai looked at her, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to tell you, it\u2019s that I don\u2019t know how to say it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right, my great scientific research can wait, I have time.\u201d Cheng Zimei blinked at him.Shen Dai said in embarrassment, \u201cI signed a confidentiality regulation.\u201d\u201cWhat, so mysterious.\u201d Cheng Zimei glared. But she knew Shen Dai\u2019s character, if he didn\u2019t want to say, his mouth really could not be pried open. Even the matter of carrying his father\u2019s huge debt, he only told her because he couldn\u2019t hold on by himself and had to ask for help.Shen Dai smiled bitterly, \u201cAnyway, it should count as a good thing.\u201d\u201cAll right, as long as it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Cheng Zimei said while grinning, \u201cIf one of us becomes rich in the future, don\u2019t forget the other.\u201dShen Dai also grinned.\u201cBy the way, which department of headquarters did you go to? Did you meet the Crown Prince?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a pity.\u201d\u201cWhat pity.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t pretend. Do you think I don\u2019t know? When have your eyes not followed the Crown Prince whenever we happened to bump into him.\u201dShen Dai said quietly, \u201cIsn\u2019t that normal? Since he\u2019s so good-looking.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. Sometimes, I\u2019ll be thinking, is there really such a perfect man in the world? What kind of top-tier omega can be worthy of him?\u201dYou Baiyue is worthy, Shen Dai thought. What puzzles him most right now is that, after knowing that his marriage partner is a perfect S-level alpha, how did You Baiyue get marked by someone else? From You Xinghai\u2019s tone, it doesn\u2019t seem like he suffered from any violence, more like \u201ca children\u2019s ignorance is the family\u2019s misfortune\u201d. Even he felt regretful for You Baiyue.However, the fact that he was able to marry Qu Moyu on top of getting $10 million for free is equivalent to God stuffing a winning lottery ticket into his mouth. Yet he didn\u2019t feel happy, because the experience of countless predecessors tells him that if virtue doesn\u2019t match, there will always be the disaster that follows.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe efficiency of the things that happened next was so high that Shen Dai was caught off guard.First, You Xinghai\u2019s lawyer came to find him, signed some contracts with him, and helped him transfer his household registration. He didn\u2019t want to change his surname, which You Xinghai didn\u2019t care about at all. All in all, they are now father and son legally recognized by the law.His omega father was abandoned by You Xinghai in the past, when he took Shen Dai to the You family, he was sent away by a mere million. No one would have expected that one day, You Xinghai needed him to take the initiative to recognize his origins. Although he felt disgusted, he had to lower his head for the money.After completing the formalities, he got the money. Looking at the long string of zeros on the check, it felt even more exciting than when he made a set of excellent experimental data.He made a plan in his mind. He will first pay back the money he owed, which will leave him with more than two million. Although it was not enough to buy a house, it\u2019s enough for a down payment. His grandma has medical insurance and pension, and adding his salary, he should have no problem with medical treatment, mortgage, and daily expenses. Without this heavy load in his heart, he suddenly felt that the wind was light, the clouds were clear, and the road to the future was open. However, he still has to figure out a way to explain to his grandma how he suddenly got so much money. As for marriage, he decided to hide it for as long as he could.The next day, he had to take another half-day off. Early in the morning, he went to the marriage registration office with Qu Moyu to take photos, register, review, and sign the papers. He could clearly feel Qu Moyu\u2019s displeasure with these processes. In order to prevent being photographed by the media, they came before it opened. Unfortunately, no matter how rich Qu Moyu is, he still had to come personally.After that, Qu Moyu left in a hurry.Shen Dai looked at the little\u00a0red book\u00a0in his hand and the photo of the two, then dazed for a moment. He never imagined what kind of person he would marry. In all those years of debt, he only knew that he shouldn\u2019t be dragging other people down, so he cut off the idea of starting any feelings. His fantasy of Qu Moyu was like a piece of candy in his pocket. It\u2019s enough to occasionally taste the sweetness, after all, a little bit of placebo is needed in one\u2019s life.At this moment, he looked at the two people in the photo, one reserved and the other perfunctory. They both didn\u2019t smile. If it weren\u2019t for the red background and it being pasted on the red marriage certificate, no one would believe that it was a marriage photo. However, in his eyes, Qu Moyu\u2019s face is glittering, it was a face that no candy nor any placebo could compare. To him, this person is a path of light that allows him to feel the brightness and warmth in the dark abyss. Twice, at that. The first time, he saved him when he went into heat due to a setup. When all the alphas around him were almost out of control, only Qu Moyu comforted him with his powerful pheromone control and helped him avoid unimaginable aftermaths. The second time, it was even more as if he descended from the heavens without warning, pulling him out of the crisis of his bottomless debt.Shen Dai is a scientist, but he can\u2019t help believing in fatalism at this moment. Perhaps there really is some fate between him and Qu Moyu?His thoughts were interrupted by lawyer Chen\u2019s voice. In the next moment, his marriage certificate was taken away.Lawyer Chen put the little red book into his briefcase, \u201cAll these things will be kept by me, you don\u2019t have to worry about it. There\u2019s a car waiting for you outside, it will take you to President Qu\u2019s residence.\u201d\u201cRight now?\u201d Shen Dai looked at his watch. \u201cI only took half a day off.\u201dLawyer Chen laughed, \u201cYou are now President Qu\u2019s wife. Nothing will happen even if you take the other half of the day off. I\u2019ll see you off.\u201dWe\u2019re sorry for MTLers or people who like using reading mode, but our translations keep getting stolen by aggregators so we\u2019re going to bring back the copy protection. If you need to MTL please retype the gibberish parts.Shen Dai genuinely felt uncomfortable with this title, and the sense of unreality that ran through this whole matter never dissipated.Lf uba lc atf mjg jcv la vgbnf boo ab atf rbeat bo atf mlas.Vtfc Gjl rlifcais ibbxfv ja atf rmfcfgs bearlvf atf klcvbk.

I can\u2019t explain it to my colleagues if such a car picks me up and drops me off. It also goes against confidentiality.\u201d\u201cYou can negotiate a better plan with President Qu\u2019s housekeeper.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dThe car drove underground, and a male beta with a head full of\u00a0Argentum cream\u00a0was waiting at the door.\u201cHello, Mr. Shen. I\u2019m the housekeeper here. You can call me Uncle Heng. I welcome you to this house.\u201d\u201cHello.\u201d Shen Dai looked at the unsmiling man in front of him and felt very clearly that he did not actually want to \u201cwelcome\u201d him.After Lawyer Chen left, Uncle Heng took Shen Dai upstairs and gave him a general introduction to the functional areas of the villa. He felt like someone looking to buy the house. Uncle Heng introduced while walking, he basically stated clearly the borderlines of his life here, such as \u201cYour room is the southernmost one on the second floor\u201d, \u201cThe whole third floor is the young master\u2019s private activity area. Please do not go up without permission\u201d, \u201cYou can choose to eat in your room or the dining room. However, when the time comes that I suggest you eat in your room, it is when the young master does not want to be disturbed\u201d, \u201cThe gym and swimming pool on the ground floor can be used as long as the young master is not using it\u201d. Listening up to here, he felt more like someone visiting hotel rooms. After all, he couldn\u2019t afford such a house and is just staying here temporarily.Finally, Uncle Heng brought Shen Dai into his room. Although it was only a guest room, it was still bigger than many small houses. It was equipped with a bathroom, a walk-in closet, and had all the necessary living facilities and items. Let alone his bag, he can even live here if he bought just his physical body over. He can even survive here without leaving the house, which was just what Shen Dai wanted.Uncle Heng said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what special preferences you have in life but I prepared some in advance. If you think the fabric of bed products is not comfortable enough, or if the bathroom products are not your favorite brand, or if the coffee does not taste good enough, you can tell me.\u201d\u201cThank you. Everything is fine.\u201d\u201cThe young master said that you will go to work every day. Do you have any prefer-\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s not necessary. It\u2019s not suitable for me to take such a car. I live in the company dormitory most of the time, I can just take a taxi.\u201d Of course, Shen Dai knows that this family rejects his intrusion, the intrusion of a stranger. It\u2019s impossible for him to bring contempt upon himself. If it\u2019s not necessary, he\u2019ll try to come back as little as possible and make people dislike him less.Uncle Heng\u2019s eyebrows moved a bit and seemed to be surprised, \u201cOkay, do you have any other requirements, eating habits, and the like?\u201d\u201cNo, whatever is fine.\u201d Shen Dai said, \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019m going back to the company.\u201dUncle Heng stared at Shen Dai and asked again, \u201cDo you really have no requirements?\u201d\u201cUh, not at the moment. I\u2019ll tell you if I think of anything.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll see you out.\u201dThe two went down the stairs but happened to see Qu Moyu entering the door.When Qu Moyu saw Shen Dai, it was obvious that he was stunned for a bit. He didn\u2019t seem to understand why this man appeared in his home, but he quickly realized.\u201cYoung master, why did you come back?\u201d\u201cI got up too early this morning. I came back for a rest since I happened to be near home just now.\u201d Qu Moyu took off his suit and handed it to Uncle Heng, \u201cI already had lunch.\u201d He took off his tie and looked at Shen Dai with an inquisitive gaze.\u201cPresident Qu.\u201d Shen Dai nodded slightly, then lowered his eyes. Qu Moyu\u2019s single action of pulling his tie can really make people\u2019s hearts beat, it was truly fatal.\u201cHow\u2019s the environment?\u201d Qu Moyu asked casually.\u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d\u201cIf you need something, just tell Uncle Heng.\u201d\u201cOkay, thank you.\u201d Shen Dai said, \u201cI\u2019ll go back to the company first. I usually live in the company dormitory, I won\u2019t be much of a disturbance to you.\u201dQu Moyu looked at Shen Dai: \u201cYou\u2019re going to live in the company dormitory?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2026\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re already married. You need to live at home.\u201d Qu Moyu gave his tie to Uncle Heng and walked to the sofa, \u201cTea.\u201dShen Dai hesitated for a moment, then slowly walked to Qu Moyu\u2019s side and stood aside like an employee here for a hearing. In fact, he is indeed Qu Moyu\u2019s employee.Uncle Heng brought over the tea and put it on the coffee table, then retreated to one side.Qu Moyu slowly took a sip of tea, then leaned his entire relaxed upper body close to the leather sofa. He took out his mobile phone and looked through it. At the same time, he said, \u201cAlthough this is a cooperation, there are some things that need to be maintained for appearances, which you may not understand, but you can still do so anyway, right?\u201dShen Dai inexplicably felt some kind of pressure. Even though Qu Moyu didn\u2019t even look at him, he said, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAre you dissatisfied with the residence? Or do you have any psychological barriers?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine here. I\u2019m just afraid of disturbing you.\u201d\u201cThe house is very big, I believe you are a person with a sense of propriety and won\u2019t disturb me.\u201d Qu Moyu suddenly stopped his fingers from typing and glanced up at Shen Dai, \u201cOr perhaps, are you afraid that I\u2019ll ask you to fulfill some of the \u2018obligations\u2019 of a wife?\u201dShen Dai felt his face burn a little. He secretly peeked at Uncle Heng and noticed that Uncle Heng stood there with a humble posture showing absolutely no reaction. He lowered his head and didn\u2019t know how to answer.\u201cYou can rest assured that I have no other \u2018needs\u2019 from you other than writing that contract. You can live here at ease.\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s last few words did not lose their politeness, but every word was a slap in Shen Dai\u2019s face. It was advice, a wake-up call, and a warning. He remembered the clause in the contract \u2014\u2014 that he cannot conceive President Qu\u2019s offspring without authorization. There are countless people who want to please such a blessed alpha like Qu Moyu. It even went as far as firing 3 people the first year after Qu Moyu took charge of the company just so that he could cut off the indiscriminate desires of anyone in the company. It\u2019ll be a joke if Shen Dai said he\u2019s worried about what Qu Moyu might do to him. Qu Moyu should be the one who\u2019s worried about him plotting a conspiracy. Qu Moyu will not let an omega of ordinary origin with an ordinary pheromone level get pregnant with the children of the Qu family. This is why he wrote this clause in black on white and included it in the contract.He isn\u2019t stupid. He knew from the start that Qu Moyu would not touch him. It\u2019s just that hearing these painful words from someone he admired, he was truly embarrassed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tell Uncle Heng about your tastes.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you, President Qu.\u201dQu Moyu stood up and a faint and fleeting fragrance intruded Shen Dai\u2019s nostrils. The calm, dry, slightly astringent thick wooden fragrance gave people a strong sense of strength. This was Qu Moyu\u2019s ebony pheromone, which was very consistent with his aura.Shen Dai\u2019s profound memories were recalled by this scent.Three years ago, he was drugged by a shixiong that competed with him for a place in the talent plan. It ended up inducing his heat. The inhibitor he carried with him completely failed. He struggled painfully in the laboratory, being tortured to the point that his reasoning was almost exhausted. He wanted to catch any alpha he could and relieve the primitive impulse in his body. His pheromones are the scent of epiphyllums, so his body also has some characteristics of epiphyllums. For example, a normal omega goes through heats four times a year, lasting an average of seven days, while his only comes one or two times a year, lasting three or four days. Usually, his pheromone scent is very faint. After putting the pheromone sticker on his gland, it becomes so faint that he is often mistaken as a beta. However, once he gets his heat, his pheromone concentration is several times higher than that of ordinary omega. The dosage of inhibitors he uses is also higher than that of ordinary people. After being drugged, it came too fiercely and he couldn\u2019t control it at all.At that time, he felt that he was done for. He went into heat in a public place, on top of that, it was the laboratory where he worked. His body, his future, his reputation, his dignity, and everything will be destroyed. The fragrant smell of epiphyllum infected half of the research institute. Several alphas were on the verge of losing control. If it wasn\u2019t for the obstruction of several beta colleagues, they would\u2019ve rushed in immediately. At that time, Qu Moyu just happened to be inspecting research institutes under the company. The 21-year-old heir had just returned from a top university abroad and officially entered the company to hone his skills. Only the S-level alpha, who has received severe pheromone control training since childhood, can resist the temptation of the omega in heat.When Qu Moyu came to him, he was frightened yet eager. He trembled with fear, but he held the man tightly. He desperately wanted to get something from the other that could alleviate the pain, but the other restrained his body in place and comforted him softly beside his ear. He was so muddleheaded that he couldn\u2019t understand anything. He only felt that the voice was like a clear spring flowing through, which eased his anxiety a little. Then he smelled the ebony pheromones, it was powerful, composed, forgiving, and prudent. It instantly eroded his brain and cleansed his soul. It was like a lighthouse in the vast chaos that guided him with its lofty light. He happily released his own pheromones to pursue his light. He could feel the entanglement and adhesion between epiphyllum and ebony in the air, both the rigidity and softness go hand in hand. He was sure that the lighthouse was also shaking in the wind and rain, it hesitated and wavered for a while, but in the end, it stabilized its foundation and used its pheromones to suppress him. After that, he felt a stabbing pain in the back of his neck. Qu Moyu gave him a temporary mark and calmed his disarray. When the safety department specialized in dealing with emergencies came, he was shot with a tranquilizer.We\u2019re sorry for MTLers or people who like using reading mode, but our translations keep getting stolen by aggregators so we\u2019re going to bring back the copy protection. If you need to MTL please retype the gibberish parts.Without experiencing this deep despair, he wouldn\u2019t have experienced this strong attachment to the person who redeemed him. Qu Moyu only gave him only a temporary mark, yet it has been engraved in his heart. However, he knew that the two would not interact again, he was already too old to be dreaming. He only regarded it as a fortuitous encounter and buried his desires. He will just take glances from a distance, which will glances full of joy.Fcobgaecjafis, ojaf obgmlyis vgjuufv atfw abufatfg.

He said, \u201cIn the evening, someone will bring you to take your measurements to order some formal clothes. In a few days, it will be my father\u2019s birthday banquet and I need to take you home.\u201d Then he went upstairs without looking back.\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter Shen Dai returned to the research institute, he packed some clothes and daily necessities from his dormitory. He didn\u2019t need to bring too many things, there seemed to be everything in that guest room. Looking around his small dormitory, it wasn\u2019t even as big as a certain someone\u2019s bathroom, but it made him feel safe here. That place, Qu Moyu\u2019s home, makes him nervous.After work, the Qu family\u2019s driver came to pick him up. Uncle Heng was also in the car, he came to accompany him to a private club that customizes suits.When Uncle Heng communicated with the tailor, Shen Dai also put forward some requests on the selection of fabrics and thread. He is on the thin side, so woolen threads could help add a sense of stability to him.Uncle Heng glanced at Shen Dai unexpectedly. He probably thought that Shen Dai didn\u2019t look like a person who knew how to customize suits since he was usually dressed in simple commuter\u2019s casual clothes.Shen Dai saw through his gaze but remained extremely calm. He rarely had emotional fluctuations because of people he didn\u2019t care about, plus, he could also understand Uncle Heng\u2019s surprise. He grew up in a family atmosphere that was full of artistic atmosphere and romantic feelings. Although it wasn\u2019t luxurious, clothing expenses were of high quality. However, he became too poor in recent years that he started to pay less attention. Moreover, as he grew up, he began to resist fine literature and art from his heart. In university, he chose engineering without hesitation. It was not that he didn\u2019t like his childhood life, but that he saw his father get spoiled in that kind of family into a naive, selfish, stupid ingrate.He believed that his grandparents\u2019 parenting philosophy was meant to be forgiving and happy. They encouraged children to pursue and live out their own ideals for beauty, love, and romantic hymns. However, this education lacked responsibility and pragmatism. As a result, his father became a selfish whimsical fool that was desperate for love. At a young age, he thought the love between him and the rich young master was vigorous but found out later that the other was a scumbag. After being abandoned, he forced himself to give birth. Afterward, he thought he found true love from a liar and betrayed his family. He stole all the assets and put them up as collateral for the other. Compared to You Xinghai, who Shen Dai had seen two times in his life, he hated and despised his father a hundred times more.Shen Dai looked at himself in the mirror, but frowned because he saw some similarities to his father\u2019s face.In the next few days, Shen Dai took a taxi plus the subway to commute. Although it was more troublesome than before, he didn\u2019t have to punch in and the hours were relatively unrestrained. He was also considering whether he should buy a cheap scooter.On Saturday night, he changed into the suit he had just received and sat quietly in the living room and waited. It was until Uncle Heng informed him that he walked out the door and got inside the\u00a0Phantom Extended\u00a0outside.Qu Moyu was sitting in the car reading documents. He was dressed in a suit and leather shoes. His tall and strong figure is perfectly complemented by the high-quality fabrics and tailoring. His skin was so smooth that it was shining. From the bone of his eyebrows to his nose to his jaw, every single line is steep and beautiful. Even the stands of his hair are completely gathered in the right position. Every frame is a refined pictorial, it was noble and elegant. The backplate of the back seat was completely lowered, providing him with a luxurious and spacious private space. This place seemed like his own moving office.Such a space is naturally filled with the scent of his ebony pheromones.Shen Dai got inside silently, \u201cHello President Qu.\u201dQu Moyu raised his head and looked at Shen Dai, his pupils briefly paused, \u201cThe clothes fit very well.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe car started moving. For half the way there, Qu Moyu looked at documents while Shen Dai looked out at the scenery \u2014\u2014 it\u2019s impolite to play on his phone in front of his boss.Then, Qu Moyu closed the documents and adjusted his sitting posture.Shen Dai realized that Qu Moyu had something to say, so he slightly turned his body towards him.\u201cI\u2019m taking you home today and it\u2019s your first formal meeting with my family. You don\u2019t have to be nervous. Just answer whatever the elders ask you. You don\u2019t need to talk much, don\u2019t take the initiative to speak, and just be polite and maintain your smile.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\u201cI have a cousin.\u201d Qu Moyu paused briefly, \u201cHe might ask you a lot of questions and even deliberately make things difficult for you. Try to avoid him. In short, we can\u2019t put our \u2018cooperative relationship\u2019 out in the open because the elders at home don\u2019t want to see us fight.\u201dHearing these words, Shen Dai didn\u2019t actually understand but could only continue to agree.\u201cYou need to know sooner or later, so I\u2019ll tell you a few things in advance.\u201d Qu Moyu saw Shen Dai\u2019s confusion. He said very calmly, \u201cYou should have heard the saying that it\u2019s extremely lucky if there is an S-level alpha in the family, but a complete disaster if there are two. My cousin is the second S-level alpha in our family, and he marked my fiancee.\u201dShen Dai immediately understood everything.Putting it simply, the relationship between a S-level alpha and another S-level alpha is that one mountain cannot tolerate two tigers.Alphas are the most aggressive and competitive gender. They were born naturally belligerent, they have eagers to conquer and an endless desire for power. Alphas with S-level pheromones are the natural kings standing at the top of the human food chain. Almost all of them have beautiful appearances, strong physiques, and superb wisdom. They also carry their own biological weapon \u2014\u2014 pheromone suppression. They are predators of genetic dividends and monopolize most of the world\u2019s resources and wealth. Most of those who can stand at the peak in various fields are S-level alphas, they are the uncrowned rulers and emperors in this secularized society. The world has another nickname for them \u2014\u2014\u00a0the top predators.Naturally, such superior genes are very scarce. The simultaneous appearance of two in a family means that they will have to live in the cruel internal competition all their life until the final victory is determined.Shen Dai immediately felt numb from his scalp.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, compared with the You family\u2019s house which gives people the impression of its decline, this manor is an antique that needs to be carefully appreciated as it had witnessed three generations of glory.After getting out of the car, Qu Moyu came to his side and said quietly, \u201cNo need to be nervous.\u201dHis voice still carried the penetrating feeling of a man in his youth, yet it was far more stable and intimidating than his age. When he said \u201cNo need to be nervous\u201d, his tone was calm, but it was more like an order than comfort.\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s true that Shen Dai isn\u2019t nervous, because this is neither his home nor the place where he needs to show himself. He\u2019s just here to be a decoration, not to defend a thesis. As long as he presents himself as a qualified decoration, it won\u2019t even get to his turn to worry since there will be Qu Moyu in any given situation.But the very next moment, he turned assuredly nervous. This is because Qu Moyu took his hand.That broad, dry, and powerful hand held his and the faint fragrance of ebony lingered in the air around him. The touch, temperature, smell, and all senses made him feel that he was surrounded by Qu Moyu in layers.Thump, thump, thump, that was the sound of his heart beating rapidly.Qu Moyu led him into the house hand in hand. There was classical music being played in the old house. A room full of people were scattered all over the huge living room, some chatting and some admiring the paintings. The appearance of the two immediately attracted everyone\u2019s attention.\u201cMoyu, you\u2019re back.\u201d An elder smiled and nodded at him.\u201cSecond uncle.\u201d Qu Moyu greeted everyone one by one, \u201cWhere\u2019s my father?\u201d\u201cHe went to answer the phone, might be in the study.\u201d The elder looked at Shen Dai, \u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\u201cLet me introduce you, this is my wife, Shen Dai, who is also a researcher at our Rare Earth-Elements Research Institute.\u201d Qu Moyu smiled and patted Shen Dai on the back of his waist.\u201cHello everyone.\u201d Shen Dai slightly raised himself.\u201cThen you must be really smart. Not bad, not bad.\u201d\u201cSo you guys must\u2019ve met in the company.\u201dAlthough a few people gave a few polite remarks, in fact, they were not interested in him at all. Very soon, they only talked to Qu Moyu.The Qu family\u2019s relatives are well-off and have seen the world, they are all very clever. From the fact that Qu Moyu did not have a wedding and did not make it public, they already know that Shen Dai can\u2019t be put on the table. Naturally, they have also heard some gossip about Shen Dai\u2019s origin. No one really regards him as \u201cQu Moyu\u2019s wife\u201d.We\u2019re sorry for MTLers or people who like using reading mode, but our translations keep getting stolen by aggregators so we\u2019re going to bring back the copy protection.

However, S-level alphas are different, the lone kings cannot stand being bounded by others. Only a few of them will mark a partner who brings them great benefits, treating it as a bargaining chip exchanged for resources.So obviously, the cousin that Qu Moyu talked about, clearly started a war by marking You Baiyue. He also didn\u2019t know what treasures the rapidly declining You family had in their hands, he was also quite curious.After a while, a middle-aged alpha came down the stairs. It was Qu Shen, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Xingzhou Group, also Qu Moyu\u2019s father. Shen Dai would only get to see him at the annual meeting.\u201cFather.\u201d Qu Moyu took Shen Dai over.Qu Shen nodded and his eyes fell on Shen Dai.Shen Dai bowed and said, \u201cHello, Director Qu.\u201d\u201cMn, Shen Dai, right? I heard you\u2019re a researcher at our Rare Earth-Elements Research Institute and a student of Professor Liu?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThe refining and separation technology your group is studying is very important to the future of the group and can greatly enhance our country\u2019s international competitiveness in the rare earth-elements industry. You have to put in good effort.\u201d\u201cYes, laoshi and we will work hard to live up to your expectations.\u201d\u201cYou come here, I need to tell you something.\u201d Then Qu Shen said to someone who looked like a housekeeper, \u201cStart dinner at half-past seven.\u201dQu Moyu followed Qu Shen upstairs again, leaving Shen Dai alone in the house of a group of strangers. He silently retreated to the wall and appreciated a painting by Hans Holbein the Younger on the wall. If it was placed in the living room of the Qu family, of course it has to be an authentic piece.His grandfather is a traditional Chinese painter. Although he didn\u2019t create many famous paintings, he is respected in the fields of education, art research, and appreciation. If his grandfather was still alive, he could\u2019ve taken out his phone to take a picture so that when he goes home, he could\u2019ve had a good conversation with the old man about the painting.He suddenly missed his grandparents. There were so many people in the room, although it couldn\u2019t be called lively, everyone had company. Only he and his grandma did not. While he was facing this painting alone, his grandma might be facing a potted flower or a book alone, living in a small house that didn\u2019t belong to her, thinking about the past and her loved one while being swallowed by pain, loneliness, and regret for the rest of her life.The sudden sadness made his chest so stuffy that he didn\u2019t even notice that the door of the entrance opened again and someone came in.It was until he heard the approaching footsteps, did he turn his head. A tall young man stood beside him. He has 30 to 40 percent similarities in appearance to Qu Moyu, but the 60 to 70 percent that was different had their own merits. He was equally otherworldly handsome and aristocratically dignified. Similarly, people could also feel his powerful alpha pheromones. Shen Dai was able to immediately guess who it was.\u201cHi, I\u2019m Qu Chengchen.\u201d Qu Chengchen put his hands in his pockets and grinned. He looked like a gentle and casual young man. \u201cYou\u2019re my\u00a0da-ge\u2019s wife that he just married. I think I should be calling you\u00a0sao-zi.\u201dShen Dai nodded and said politely, \u201cHello.\u201dQu Chengchen scanned Shen Dai up and down, \u201cYou really don\u2019t look like an omega. How did Uncle You suddenly\u2026 take you back in?\u201dShen Dai thought in his head,\u00a0miscalculated, didn\u2019t you? You thought you could occupy the magpie\u2019s nest by robbing someone else\u2019s fiancee but you didn\u2019t expect your Uncle You to have a hidden card, pulling out an illegitimate son from the past he was eager to get rid of.\u00a0However, Shen Dai was calm and natural, \u201cI\u2019m not sure either.\u201dQu Chengchen raised his eyebrow, \u201cAre you really You Xinghai\u2019s son?\u201d\u201cI am.\u201d\u201cAre you really an omega?\u201d\u201cI am.\u201dQu Chengchen didn\u2019t expect Shen Dai to be so stubborn. He answered everything that was asked, but all his answers were rubbish. He slightly narrowed his eyes, \u201cBut why can\u2019t I smell your pheromones?\u201d With one step, he arrived right next to Shen Dai, and at the same time, he bent down, coming close to the back of Shen Dai\u2019s neck.Shen Dai instinctively wanted to turn around and hide. The gland in the back neck is just like the throat, they are both fatal. In fact, it\u2019s actually a layer more symbolic meaningful than the throat; it belongs to a private part. No matter Qu Chengchen\u2019s purpose, anyone whose gland is suddenly approached by a stranger would make defensive measures based on animal instinct.However, his body suddenly couldn\u2019t move. It was as if he was trapped in a nightmare and lost control of himself. He could only let Qu Chengchen move his face near the back neck at his discretion, letting him wrinkle his nose and take a sniff.\u201cOh, you are indeed an omega, but the scent of your pheromones is so weak.\u201dThe next moment, Shen Dai\u2019s body was \u201creleased\u201d. He took a big step back and angrily glared at Qu Chengchen.Everyone has more or less encountered alpha pheromone suppression growing up. Some might be because the other was too young to control it, some might be because of contradictions and conflicts, or more seriously, they might have encountered malicious attacks. Compared to people of other genders, alphas are like boxers and their pheromones are their fists. Of course, the attack power of alphas is naturally different level to level. However, in this society ruled by law, alphas must restrain their own power to avoid harming others. Most of the time, they don\u2019t need to bring out their fists, they can achieve their goal with a single wave of their hand. For example, they can release a little bit of pheromones to threaten others. When they really do decide to use their fist, as long as they haven\u2019t lost their mind, it would usually only be used on boxers of the same level. Which would result in competition rather than unilateral persecution.However, Qu Chengchen had just used his pheromone suppression on Shen Dai, which was a great offense. Although it only made him temporarily unable to move, it was already vile enough. What scared Shen Dai the most was that Qu Chengchen only released a small amount of pheromones. There were so many people in the room, yet no one was aware of it except him. Is this what an S-level alpha is? When encountering common boxers, ordinary people can at least struggle and resist a bit, but Qu Chengchen controlled him as easily as breathing.Qu Chengchen blinked, \u201cAre you mad? I apologize. What\u2019s the scent of your pheromones? It smells quite nice actually, it\u2019s just too faint. Is your gland not developing well? Will it affect fertility?\u201d\u201cChengchen.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s low pressure voice sounded from behind.Shen Dai took a breath and turned to look at Qu Moyu. There was a trace of panic in his glistening pupils, very different from his usual calm appearance.Qu Moyu gave Shen Dai a reassuring look, then looked at Qu Chengchen coldly, \u201cWhat did you just do?\u201d\u201cDa-ge.\u201d Qu Chengchen put on a fake smile, \u201cJust getting to know my sao-zi.\u201d\u201cYou smelled my wife\u2019s gland?\u201d\u201cNo offense, but the scent of his pheromones is too weak, I thought he was a beta.\u201d\u201cApologize.\u201d\u201cI have already apologized.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t hear it.\u201d Qu Moyu stared at Qu Chengchen with sharp eyes.Qu Chengchen\u2019s smile gradually disappeared.Two top-level alphas stared at each other within the distance of two adjacent tiles. What\u2019s the difference between this and a cage of two tigers? Everyone in the living room dared not say a word. Two types of tyrannical pheromones were hidden and yet to be released, which really made people panic.At last, Qu Chengchen shrugged his shoulders, revealed a smile again, and said to Shen Dai, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This Chairman of the Board of Directors of theirs is not the largest shareholder of Xingzhou, Qu Moyu\u2019s grandfather is. However, Qu Shen is currently the top decision-maker in Xingzhou.Old man Qu had already retired for many years. Various business segments of the group are divided into three parts and split between the hands of his two alpha sons and one alpha daughter. The most important rare earth-elements and non-ferrous metals are controlled by his second son Qu Shen. However, his eldest son also has the fast-growing chemical and energy projects in his hands. Qu Shen\u2019s generation fought fiercely. When Qu Moyu was born, he thought that he had the future firmly in his hands since an S-level alpha would undoubtedly become the leader of Xingzhou group. Unexpectedly, Qu Chengchen was born the next year. Qu Moyu is neither from the eldest branch nor the eldest grandson. Qu Chengchen is from the eldest branch but not the eldest grandson, moreover, he\u2019s the younger brother. From the perspective of inheritance, they\u2019re both justified, whoever\u2019s capable should do it, the one with talent and ability should be appointed. Old man Qu knows that the existence of two S-level alphas will bring endless internal friction. There have been checks and balances in recent years, but unfortunately, he\u2019s old now, and the fight between his children and grandchildren has become more and more obvious.Shen Dai thought of some gossip he heard from Cheng Zimei and couldn\u2019t help secretly glancing at Qu Chengchen, who was arranged furthest away. For various reasons, he had bad feelings towards this man.\u201cMy father asked me to bring a present for uncle.\u201d Qu Chengchen smiled and said to Qu Shen, \u201cHappy Birthday, uncle.\u201dQu Shen nodded, \u201cYou\u2019re very considerate. Chengchen, you are not young anymore, you need to know what\u2019s too far and when to stop.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry for offending sao-zi.\u201d Qu Chengchen said with a smile, \u201cCome to speak of it, sao-zi and I are really fated,\u00a0Xiao-Yue is actually sao-zi\u2019s half-brother.\u201dQu Moyu seemed calm, but his expression was already gloomy. Sitting by his side, Shen Dai could clearly feel the fluctuations of his angry pheromones. Although they were restrained, they were too close, Shen Dai felt a little stuffy.Money is hard to earn, just like how shit is hard to eat, Shen Dai thought. After getting successively affected by two top-tier alpha pheromones, he had no appetite even when looking at a table full of delicious food.An elder hurried to smooth things over, \u201cWe\u2019re all family, we\u2019re all family. Hey, should we open the wine I bought over today?\u201dThis birthday party was more like a business dinner. The conversations on the table were all about business. Shen Dai ate and drank quietly in Qu Moyu\u2019s shadow. His only hope was to be able to go back early to sleep. Throughout the dinner, he could always feel someone\u2019s line of sight from the side. He knew that Qu Chengchen was looking at him, although gazes don\u2019t hurt him, they made him uncomfortable.He knew that Qu Chengchen deliberately used pheromone suppression against him, that he deliberately embarrassed him. From Qu Chengchen\u2019s point of view, although he is innocent, his existence hindered the other. Qu Chengchen must\u2019ve thought that after marking You Baiyue, he could destroy Qu Moyu\u2019s marriage alliance with You family and cut off the important interests that both parties cared about. Unexpectedly, he appeared, proving that You Xinghai did not want to cooperate with Qu Chengchen and his schemes did not succeed.We\u2019re sorry for MTLers or people who like using reading mode, but our translations keep getting stolen by aggregators so we\u2019re going to bring back the copy protection.

However, he also can\u2019t deceive himself, he really wishes he could be Qu Moyu\u2019s real wife.On the way back, Qu Moyu also brought his low pressure aura inside the car. After several hesitations, Shen Dai decided to speak, otherwise, he didn\u2019t know when they would meet again next time. He said quietly, \u201cPresident Qu.\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d\u201cCan I go home once every weekend? My grandmother lives alone.\u201dQu Moyu gave him a faint glance, \u201cSo you do have a request.\u201dShen Dai was stunned, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cBefore marriage, I asked you if you have any requests, why didn\u2019t you mention it at that time.\u201d\u201cI-, I didn\u2019t think of it.\u201d\u201cThere might be many more things you didn\u2019t think of. Will they all be put forward one by one like this in the future?\u201dShen Dai was at a loss to reply.Qu Moyu gently lifted the corners of his lips, \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, I\u2019m not blaming you. I just see that, as an ordinary person, you choose to do nothing when you rarely have chips that could be played. I don\u2019t quite appreciate this kind of unintelligent behavior. But after thinking about it, you\u2019re only an omega after all.\u201dShen Dai froze.\u201cOf course you can go home. Why should I stop you from seeing your relatives?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Thank you.\u201d\u201cI said that as long as you do what you need to do, you will have freedom and respect. You did well today.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cBut I have to remind you to be careful of Qu Chengchen.\u201d Qu Moyu turned half of his body over and stared at Shen Dai. His pupils were black and deep. The blue ambient light in the car just happened to enter his eyes, faintly and swiftly, it added a little bit of charm to his eyes. \u201cGrowing up, he competed with me for everything, even things he didn\u2019t need.\u201dShen Dai frowned slightly, \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you mean.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think he marked You Baiyue?\u201d\u201cIn order to destroy your marriage and your cooperation with You Xinghai.\u201d\u201cRight, now that he didn\u2019t succeed, he might try a different approach.\u201d Qu Moyu gently stroked the ring on his index finger. \u201cIn our cooperation, it includes your loyalty, I can\u2019t allow someone with the title of my wife to embarrass me. Can you understand if I say it like this?\u201dShen Dai took a deep breath. \u201cI understand, but today, he released\u2026\u201d\u201cI know, I\u2019m just reminding you.\u201d Qu Moyu turned his face back, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I look down upon you, but that it\u2019s hard for an omega to refuse a top-tier alpha.\u201dShen Dai lowered his head and remained silent. Phrases like \u201cyou\u2019re only an omega after all\u201d and \u201cfor an omega\u201d came one after another, everyone knows that alphas don\u2019t treat betas and omegas as equal. Even if the whole world screamed for equality, S-class alphas won\u2019t even treat ordinary alphas as equal. However, it still made him extremely uncomfortable feeling the condescension from Qu Moyu.\u201cIf he offends you, tell me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes.\u201d Whenever he is with Qu Moyu, Shen Dai can always feel that invisible sense of oppression. Perhaps this is the so-called feeling of \u201caccompanying a king is like accompanying a tiger\u201d? Sometimes he even wondered if the person who had given him a strong hug and gently comforted him beside his ear actually existed. He really was a little bit scared of Qu Moyu.Friday after work, Shen Dai returned to his grandmother\u2019s house. He had not yet thought of a good excuse for explaining how he suddenly got 10 million so he lied about receiving a project bonus. He planned to accompany his grandmother to the hospital this weekend to change to a better and more expensive treatment plan. After that, he\u2019ll go\u00a0house-hunting alone and plan to settle down in one that could be inhabited with little organizing as soon as possible. Both renovated or second-handed ones are okay, it mainly has to be clean and bright. It also needs to have a balcony with sufficient sunshine so that grandma can take good care of flowers and plants.He went back to the company dormitory Sunday evening because it would take more than two hours to get to the company if he left grandma\u2019s house the next day. Before sleeping, as he lay in bed playing on his phone, Cheng Zimei suddenly sent him gossip. He clicked into it and saw You Baiyue posted a couple picture with Qu Chengchen on his Weibo. Both of them have extremely good looks, from the beauty to the atmosphere, this picture seemed like a picture from an idol drama.An internet celebrity like You Baiyue can attract great attention no matter what he does, what he eats or wears, not to mention dating a top-tier alpha, the young master of the Qu family. You Baiyue can be called the son of heaven, his family background, wealth, genes, and beauty are all top tier. Even the mate he selected is beyond people\u2019s reach. His existence will inevitably make people sigh that God is unfair.Cheng Zimei sent a message on Wechat: Look, Qu Chengchen! I heard gossip before that the Crown Prince and Qu Chengchen were both pursuing You Baiyue, but it turned out that You Baiyue didn\u2019t choose the Crown Prince.Shen Dai felt a little flustered. He replied: Really? It shouldn\u2019t be.Cheng Zimei said: I also think so. Qu Chengchen looks fickle from a single glance. He\u2019s only 23 yet there have already been all kinds of celebrities that were dug out with him in recent years. He can\u2019t compare with the Crown Prince. The Crown Prince is the one that\u2019s the first heir, he\u2019s gentlemanly, steady, clean, and devoted to his career. What\u2019s with You Baiyue\u2019s taste.Shen Dai said: Things like love are hard to tell.Cheng Zimei replied with a\u00a0slumped face emote: Slag men are the best at sweet-talking. It must be so. The little princess, You Baiyue, definitely digs that. I don\u2019t think they will last long.Shen Dai thought, Qu Chengchen had already marked You Baiyue, it\u2019s impossible for them to separate easily. However, what puzzled him is that the pregnancy rate is very high when marked. Plus, You Baiyue is an S-class Omega, so the pregnancy rate is even higher, it can reach more than 90%. However, You Baiyue doesn\u2019t seem to be pregnant and Weibo didn\u2019t reveal any information about their engagement or marriage. Why is it like this? Do they not have any intention to marry?Cheng Zimei still feels aggrieved for Qu Moyu: The one our Crown Prince will marry in the future will definitely be the kind with good family background, good education, and very sophisticated. You Baiyue is too superficial to be worthy of our Crown Prince.Shen Dai felt deeply ashamed, but Cheng Zimei was right. She was talking about the one who Qu Moyu will \u201creally\u201d marry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s only four to five kilometers from the subway station to the Qu house, so this is the most cost-effective and the total commuting time is shorter than driving. He can also exercise his body, killing many birds with one stone.Uncle Heng turned a little stiff after seeing him ride his bike into the grand entrance of the Qu house.\u201cCan I put this in the yard?\u201d Shen Dai asked, \u201cIf I can\u2019t, I can also fold it up and put it in the garage.\u201dUncle Heng said, \u201cMr. Shen, can you drive?\u201d\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t have a car.\u201d The car left by his grandpa has long been auctioned.\u201cIf you find it inconvenient for the driver to pick you up, I can get you a more low-key car and you can drive it yourself.\u201d\u201cThe car you think is low-key also isn\u2019t exactly low-key. If my quality of life suddenly improved significantly, my colleagues around me will be curious. I hope I can follow President Qu\u2019s instructions and let this mar-\u2026\u201d Shen Dai suddenly couldn\u2019t say the word \u201cmarriage\u201d and switched it up, \u201c\u2026let this relationship remain confidential. So it doesn\u2019t really matter how I go to work.\u201dUncle Heng was helpless, \u201cAlright, then put it in the garage.\u201dShen Dai looked at his watch and said, \u201cI\u2019ll take a bath first. Please send dinner to my room.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIt already entered autumn but the temperature was still a bit hot. Shen Dai was sweating all over from biking. He went back to his room, put down his laptop and data material, then hurried into the bathroom to take a bath.He was writing a new\u00a0SCI\u00a0this year. Before he married Qu Moyu, he often stayed late in the research institute before returning to the dormitory because it had a more working and studying atmosphere. However, he tries to come back early now. It\u2019s best to be in time for a hearty dinner because the food cooked by the chef of the Qu house is both healthy and delicious. He really had enough of the food from the canteen and takeout. If the dormitory has the conditions that allow him to cook, he rather do it by himself. Unfortunately, the dormitory is purely a place for sleeping. It is very important for him to have a good meal every night.Moreover, Qu Moyu often had social meetings and did not eat at home often. He also always asked the servants to send the food to the room to avoid his sudden appearance as an outsider. However, when he occasionally worked late into the night and heard the sound of the engine of that Phantom appearing in the yard, he would secretly tear open a slit in the curtain and watch the driver in a suit and white gloves pull open the door of the car. Then he would watch Qu Moyu get out of the car and walk into the house step by step. That short period of time of only a few seconds can make him look forward to it for an entire day.Before, in the Xingzhou headquarters building where tens of thousands of people worked, it was difficult on top of difficult for him to see Qu Moyu. Now he could see him at such a close distance so often, he felt very satisfied.After taking a bath, Shen Dai sat in front of the computer wiping his hair, he checked the email just sent from his colleagues at the South African Research Institute. He threw the pheromone sticker that he forgot to take off when taking a bath into the trash can, which has already become wet and sticky.We\u2019re sorry for MTLers or people who like using reading mode, but our translations keep getting stolen by aggregators so we\u2019re going to bring back the copy protection.

The young master is waiting for you.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be right there.\u201dShen Dai closed the door, took off his pajamas, put on casual clothes, dried his hair quickly, and hurried downstairs.During his stay at the Qu house, he has never eaten in the dining room and has always been in his room. He has really achieved \u201cno disturbance\u201d. Of course, Qu Moyu knew of this but has never invited him to eat dinner together. Today is the first time. For the first time, he and Qu Moyu will \u201ceat together at home\u201d.When he came downstairs, he saw Qu Moyu in loungewear. Compared with the usual upright suit, the soft cotton cloth on him suddenly gave Qu Moyu the feeling of relaxation matching his age. No matter how high-grade his pheromones are, this man is only 24 years old after all. He also needs a strong battle outfit for him to make the cutting decision among people who are more experienced than him.Shen Dai walked to the restaurant and said, \u201cGood evening, President Qu.\u201d The food and tableware on the table were all set. Qu Moyu was really waiting for him, he instantly felt a little nervous.Qu Moyu looked at the tablet in his hand without raising his head. He was holding a stylus and making marks on a document. He pointed with his chin to his side, \u201cSit down.\u201dShen Dai sat down. The last time he had dinner next to Qu Moyu, he was tense the entire duration. This time, it was different. It was the first time he saw Qu Moyu in loungewear, a little bit of joy unavoidably bursted into his heart.A faint and elegant fragrance suddenly floated into Qu Moyu\u2019s breath. He was slightly stunned and raised his head.Shen Dai, who had just taken a bath, looked clear, bright, and beautiful. His skin is soft light-pink, and his thin body is wrapped in simple blue jeans and a gray t-shirt with a washed-out neckline. The wet ends of his hair cling softly to his slender white neck. In addition, he was obviously avoiding Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes. There was a kind of sexiness of a growing youth, which was very different from his cool and steady composure in white lab coats.The faint fragrance of epiphyllums left Qu Moyu temporarily in a trance. He remembered that when he first visited the institute three years ago, he encountered an accident \u2014\u2014 an omega was in heat in the laboratory. Omegas all have omens of their heat and would carry inhibitors before it happens. It\u2019s too careless and irresponsible for an adult to put himself in this kind of awkward situation in public. Moreover, the fragrance is too strong and confused people. It greatly surpassed the simulated pheromones during his anti-pheromone training. The ordinary omegas won\u2019t have such strong pheromones during their heat, and the ordinary alphas aren\u2019t able to handle it either. If he couldn\u2019t control the situation before the arrival of the security department, the group would face huge legal risks and a crisis of public opinion.Looking back at it now, it was the closest time in his life to losing control.At this moment, he smelled the fragrance of epiphyllums again. Although it was very faint, it still recalled his memory. He glanced at the back of Shen Dai\u2019s neck and as expected, there was no pheromone sticker, only flawless skin. When people consume alcohol, exercise, take a bath, and so forth, their blood flow will speed up and the scent of pheromones will naturally become thicker.Shen Dai noticed his gaze and suddenly remembered that he had just torn off his pheromone sticker. He subconsciously covered the back of his neck with his hand and then got up, \u201cSorry, I\u2019ll go\u2026\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Qu Moyu retracted his gaze, \u201cIt\u2019s all right. Let\u2019s eat.\u201dShen Dai hesitated and sat down, but it was difficult to sit still. It\u2019s been a long time since he had his neck naked in front of others. After differentiation, pheromone stickers are like the clothes alphas and omegas wear when they go out every day. It\u2019s for protecting themselves and avoiding giving others trouble. In other words, they usually only did not cover up in front of their family and loved ones.It\u2019s not that something will definitely happen if they smell some pheromones, but it will cause some interference to others. Shen Dai was a little flustered at this time. He didn\u2019t know whether Qu Moyu smelled his pheromone. If he did, would he have some\u2026 ideas?However, seeing that Qu Moyu\u2019s expression was as usual, Shen Dai breathed a sigh of relief, but at the same time, he was a little disappointed.\u201cI heard from Uncle Heng that you bought a bike?\u201d\u201cYes, I ride from here to the subway station and then take the subway directly to the company. It\u2019s very convenient.\u201d Shen Dai explained, \u201cThank you for providing me with a car, President Qu, but it\u2019ll be too flashy. Commuting is fine, it\u2019s faster than driving.\u201d\u201cMn, sure.\u201dAt this moment, Uncle Heng came over with a new pheromone sticker in his hand. Shen Dai quickly took it and slapped it on the back of his neck. Only then did he gently breathe out and find his sense of security.The fragrance of epiphyllums immediately disappeared. Qu Moyu remembered that day when Qu Chengchen sniffed the back of Shen Dai\u2019s neck. Indeed, the scent of his pheromone is really weak, perhaps the gland was really not developing well.They ate in silence. Shen Dai ate more modestly. During dinner, he kept peeking at Qu Moyu secretly, observing what he liked to eat and wondering why he wanted to eat with him.Qu Moyu suddenly said, \u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d\u201cPlease speak.\u201d\u201cLast time you met my parents, next, I have to take you back to You house.\u201dShen Dai knew there would be such a level. He resisted in his heart, \u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cPresident You said he had been taking care of you for years, but according to my investigation, he didn\u2019t.\u201dShen Dai put down his chopsticks and said in a deep voice, \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThen, do you have interactions with You Baiyue?\u201d\u201cAlso no.\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t met him?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cI need you to do something for me when we go to You house.\u201d Qu Moyu also put down his chopsticks and stared at Shen Dai with his deep eyes.Shen Dai did not dare to look directly at Qu Moyu and could only put on the look that he was listening.\u201cI suspect that Qu Chengchen didn\u2019t give You Baiyue a permanent mark, but a temporary mark.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s face turned pale. Qu Moyu broke up this engagement with You Baiyue because of the mark, but he still cared about whether the mark is permanent. If it\u2019s just a temporary mark\u2026 what would happen? There was a feeling of blockage in his heart, \u201cIs that possible?\u201d\u201cTemporary marks are only valid for one week, but before it disappears, they will have some characteristics similar to the permanent mark. For example, omegas will have the pheromones of the alpha on their bodies. The teeth marks from a temporary mark aren\u2019t deep and the injury on the skin can be completely healed. However, his neck is covered with a pheromone sticker and cannot be seen by others. If he has the scent of Qu Chengchen\u2019s pheromones on his body, it might not be from a permanent mark but a perfume made from the extract of Qu Chengchen\u2019s glands.\u201d Qu Moyu narrowed his eyes slowly, \u201cAll sorts of signs between them make me doubt the authenticity of this mark.\u201dShen Dai lowered his head, \u201cWhat do you need me to do?\u201d He remembered the temporary mark that Qu Moyu had given him, of course he knew all the characteristics of the temporary mark. He had once been protected and comforted by an S-level alpha pheromone. He had been surrounded by the smell of ebony and had the illusion of being owned by Qu Moyu for a short time.The temporary mark is a vain dream. After waking up, there is only endless loss and emptiness.\u201cI need you to confirm it for me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don\u2019t know him at all.\u201d\u201cAsk him directly, try to provoke him, and observe his reactions. He and Qu Chengchen are both wary of me, and it\u2019s not suitable for me to lean too close to a marked omega. But you, I believe he will come to you on his own initiative, he will be curious about you, just like Qu Chengchen.\u201dWhen Qu Moyu said this, the coldness revealed by his expression and eyes made Shen Dai doubt for a moment if this really was the person who saved him twice? He said quietly, \u201cPresident Qu, I don\u2019t know how to do it.\u201d\u201cFor a top-tier omega, it\u2019s shameful to have only received the temporary mark of his target. If you expose him, he will probably become angry.\u201dShen Dai felt even more chills down his spine. \u201cWhat if you guessed wrong and Qu Chengchen did mark him permanently?\u201d\u201cThen you will see a reasonable response.\u201dShen Dai was silent for a moment, \u201cOkay.\u201d He could not refuse Qu Moyu at all. To him, every word this man said was undoubtedly an order.\u201cFor you, this is beyond the scope of the contract. In exchange, you can also make a request.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Qu Moyu always carried out the essence of \u201ctransaction\u201d in their relationship. This meal wasn\u2019t even out of kindness from needing his help, but the fact that Qu Moyu was only willing to spare this little time for him amid his busy schedule.\u201cDon\u2019t forget what I said last time. Right now, you have chips to play.\u201dA series of drum beats set off in Shen Dai\u2019s heart. He didn\u2019t know whether Qu Moyu really didn\u2019t understand or actually didn\u2019t understand. He only has a coin in his hand. Seeing the real chips piled up on the opposite side, what courage would he have to \u201cplay\u201d and what confidence did he have to ask for requests? Even if he arrogantly went all in, he might only win a few more coins, that\u2019s all.So he cautiously put forward a \u201crequest\u201d, \u201cCan I add you on WeChat?\u201dQu Moyu narrowed his eyes slightly, looking at Shen Dai with a more probing look.Shen Dai immediately explained, \u201cI really can\u2019t think of something at the moment. Since you said this, can you give me a chance to delay the redemption? I don\u2019t usually see you, so when I think of something, I can tell you immediately. Like last time, I thought of going home on the weekend on the spot.\u201d He paused and added, \u201cI won\u2019t randomly disturb you.\u201dThe corners of Qu Moyu\u2019s lips were slightly raised, and Shen Dai\u2019s heart skipped a beat in follow-up. The undetectable smile on the other\u2019s face seemed to carry a little bit of mockery, but it might\u2019ve also been his overthinking due to his guilty conscience.\u201cOf course you can.\u201d Qu Moyu pushed his mobile phone over to Shen Dai.Returning to his room, Shen Dai\u2019s heart had not completely calmed down yet. He looked at Qu Moyu\u2019s profile picture. It was a part of a rough, dark gray, weather-beaten bark. Its gullied texture points had the momentum of the rugged rocks from the mountains, as if having an incomprehensible story hidden within every deep crack.Shen Dai\u2019s first reaction was that this was indeed a profile picture that people like Qu Moyu would use.We\u2019re sorry for MTLers or people who like using reading mode, but our translations keep getting stolen by aggregators so we\u2019re going to bring back the copy protection.

He was not surprised to only find a monotonous horizontal line. He knew that Qu Moyu did not block him from seeing his feed, but that it was just originally empty, there was nothing here.However, he was still glad to be a little closer to Qu Moyu and to have the possibility of contacting him at any time. He knows that these ideas he\u2019s having are very dangerous, people shouldn\u2019t think about things that do not belong to them. Except\u00a0he didn\u2019t voluntarily approach, he was dragged here. His light is at such a close distance and it seduces him with brightness and warmth. What other choices does he have left?Shen Dai knew that sooner or later he would have to face You Xinghai and the half brother he never met, but could see all kinds of fragments of his life on the internet at any given time.The so-called wealthy families are really slaves to formalism. Both sides clearly knew what was going on about his marriage with Qu Moyu, yet they still had to go through these meaningless acts of visiting relatives. Just like how Qu Moyu insisted that he live in the Qu house, it\u2019s all for show.When You Xinghai saw him, he showed fake affection, as if he was afraid that Qu Moyu would dislike Shen Dai as a substitute, \u201cA-dai, you\u2019re back.\u201dShen Dai endured his disgust and called out \u201cFather\u201d, then his eyes traveled past You Xinghai and saw the person behind him.Even though many photos and videos of him are posted all over the internet, even if Shen Dai thought he had already been forced to appreciate this person\u2019s beautiful face and beautiful life from all angles, it still couldn\u2019t compare to the shock the moment he saw the actual person himself.You Baiyue is as beautiful as an AI modeling mannequin. It seems that even the radian of the bangs is the optimal solution selected through repeated deduction by the algorithm, yet the moment he smiled, they turned lively.You Baiyue was smiling in his direction. Of course, this smile was for Qu Moyu.\u201cYu-ge.\u201d You Baiyue leisurely walked over, he naturally and briskly faced Qu Moyu\u2019s gazes without the slightest timidity, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u201dWhat kind of familiarity or courage does it take for an omega to look at a top-tier alpha so calmly? This wasn\u2019t a psychological problem but a physiological problem, it can be compared to whether people will be afraid of seeing a tiger.Qu Moyu smiled and said, \u201cI see you often on the internet.\u201d\u201cStop humiliating me. I\u2019m just accepting some advertising offers to earn some allowance. How can I be compared with President Qu, who attends to hundreds of important matters every day?\u201d You Baiyue\u2019s eyes are smiling and charming, they were full of enthusiasm, and there seems to be a kind of casual flirtation. His eyes shifted from Qu Moyu to Shen Dai and his expression remained very calm, \u201cHello, Shen, Dai.\u201dShen Dai smiled and nodded, \u201cHello, nice to meet you.\u201d He smelled a trace of his tuberose pheromones, which was fresh, sweet, and noble. Not to mention alphas, even he liked the smell. At the same time, he also smelled the alpha pheromones of hazelnut belonging to Qu Chengchen.You Baiyue sized up Shen Dai quietly with a kind of alienated gaze that did not carry any rudeness. He smiled softly and seemed to have something he wanted to say but remained silent.Shen Dai doesn\u2019t consider himself as overly sensitive, but You Baiyue\u2019s attitude might be more contemptuous than Qu Chengchen\u2019s intentional embarrassment. Of course, he can also understand that You Baiyue\u2019s feelings towards him must be very complicated.\u201cWhere\u2019s Chengchen?\u201d Qu Moyu asked.\u201cHe has some other business, he\u2019ll arrive late.\u201d You Baiyue glanced at his mobile phone and said, \u201cHe\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d\u201cYou guys chat first. President You and I will go talk about something.\u201d Qu Moyu made a \u201cplease go ahead\u201d gesture to You Xinghai.You Xinghai said, \u201cXiao-Yue, take A-Dai to rest.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dAfter they left, Shen Dai and You Baiyue were the only two left at the spot, the atmosphere froze for a while. Shen Dai was completely unafraid of awkwardness so he stood there dumbfounded. He did promise Qu Moyu to test You Baiyue, but in any case, to start the conversation, You Baiyue had to drop his guard and be the one to speak first. He believed that You Baiyue would speak first.Sure enough, You Baiyue said, \u201cDo you want me to take you to meet your relatives?\u201dShen Dai glanced at the relatives present, they were all sizing him up secretly, but no one took the initiative to come forward. Of course, he\u2019s just an illegitimate son of You Xinghai who had been cast aside like an old shoe. Now there are benefits to be reaped, he was brought back. No one really wants to establish any relationship with him.\u201cDon\u2019t bother.\u201d Shen Dai said.\u201cI heard you work in the Rare Earth-Elements Research Institute of Xingzhou? What a\u00a0xueba.\u201d\u201cNot really, it\u2019s just an ordinary job.\u201dYou Baiyue looked at him with his head tilted and said with a smile, \u201cAre you scared to look at me, or do you dislike me?\u201dShen Dai looked at You Baiyue\u2019s eyes and smiled politely, \u201cNo, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve met. We still haven\u2019t found a suitable conversational topic yet.\u201d\u201cA suitable conversational topic.\u201d You Baiyue seemed to have heard a joke and said with a laugh, \u201cThere are many topics between us, such as the relationship between our parents, the relationship between us, and our relationship with the Qu brothers. In fact, it\u2019s actually quite amazing. There are so many relations between us, yet today is our first meeting.\u201dShen Dai nodded and thought it was very reasonable, \u201cIndeed, then which topic do you want to talk about?\u201d\u201cYou have nothing to ask me?\u201d You Baiyue asked back.Shen Dai pondered for a moment, \u201cWhy did you break off the engagement? This is what you think I\u2019m most curious about, right?\u201d\u201cAre you not curious?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m curious, but I don\u2019t like to pry into other people\u2019s privacy.\u201dYou Baiyue gently raised her eyebrows, \u201cYou are\u2026 a little interesting.\u201d\u201cIf I know your privacy, then I\u2019ll have to return the favor with my privacy.\u201d Shen Dai looked at You Baiyue dully, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just get to the point and say what you want to know from me? I\u2019ll see if I can tell you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really convenient to talk to smart people.\u201d You Baiyue said with a smile, \u201cI want to know if you slept with Yu-ge?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cDo you want him to mark you?\u201d\u201cWe have a cooperative relationship. I believe you know very well.\u201d\u201cYou avoided the question.\u201dShen Dai frowned slightly, \u201cI have already answered one of your questions. Now it\u2019s my turn to ask. Why did you break off the engagement?\u201d From the perspective of the vast majority of people, nobody will not want to marry a top-tier alpha.You Baiyue\u2019s eyes drifted aimlessly to the distance, \u201cWhat, he didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cHe said he would never give away his mark.\u201d You Baiyue gently pursued his lips and carried a bit of ridicule.Shen Dai was not surprised by this answer.\u201cIf I can\u2019t even get his mark, why should I?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Is it that important?\u201d\u201cThe mark of ordinary alphas is certainly not important. Perhaps even the wealth of the whole family of three generations is no more than a house in the city, but the Qu family\u2026\u201d You Baiyue blinked at Shen Dai.\u201cThen, have you got what you wanted now?\u201d Shen Dai looked at You Baiyue with calm eyes, but it also had a sense of aloofness to it, \u201cWhat Qu Chengchen gave you was just a temporary mark.\u201dYou Baiyue immediately showed a shocked expression.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, it\u2019s to pledge ownership.\u201d According to Shen Dai\u2019s observation of You Baiyue, this man never hesitates to show off his superior life. It\u2019s not only his character, but also the image he wants to create. Getting the mark of a top-tier alpha is worth showing off more than anything else, how could he remain silent.\u201cWe\u2019re still young and uncertain about our future plans. Of course we should be more cautious.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re not pregnant and I haven\u2019t heard anything of you guys getting engaged or married.\u201d Shen Dai smiled and shook his head, \u201cWhich means that other than a mark, you have nothing. How can people not doubt the authenticity of the mark? What I can think of, President Qu can think of too.\u201dYou Baiyue snorted and smiled, \u201cSo what if people doubt? It\u2019s our business.\u201d\u201cMany people don\u2019t regard this as solely your business, but at least it has nothing to do with me.\u201d Shen Dai saw a look of resentment appearing on You Baiyue\u2019s beautiful face. Thinking that the other will definitely tell Qu Chengchen about this conversation, he can finally take revenge on Qu Chengchen for offending him that day.Shen Dai can understand why You Baiyue was so attached to the mark. As he said, it represents the huge wealth and status that will be presented in front of him in the future. He also gets to monopolize the reproduction resources of a top-tier alpha for creating top-tier living conditions for his offspring. People cannot get rid of their animal nature after all. Therefore, when he knew that Qu Moyu couldn\u2019t give it to him, he turned to Qu Chengchen, which was actually very clear-minded and smart.Unfortunately, which S-level alpha could be so easily manipulated? He\u2019s guessing that there must be some sort of game between You Baiyue and Qu Chengchen.These naked calculations hidden behind marriage and love make Shen Dai feel uncomfortable. He is by no means an idealist who puts romance first, on the contrary, he is very mature and pragmatic. He just feels that people should have feelings and trade-offs should remain as trade-offs. Two people should not only be having matching value, but also some connections from the soul. After all, these two conditions do not have to conflict, why must it be so materialistic?Of course, perhaps he hasn\u2019t seen much money and could not think from the cognitive level of the actual rich.After being briefly angered, You Baiyue calmed his mood, \u201cThis is what Yu-ge told you, right? He suspects that there\u2019s only a temporary mark between us?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m just following along with your chats about topics you\u2019re interested in.\u201dYou Baiyue chuckled, \u201cActually, you\u2019re quite worried, aren\u2019t you? After all, Yu-ge wanted to marry me. If I had no mark, why would he marry you?\u201dShen Dai said helplessly, \u201cAnyway, I got the money. You guys can do whatever you want.\u201dYou Baiyue stared at Shen Dai with a look of scrutiny, trying to catch some flaws from his expression, but Shen Dai acted as if he really didn\u2019t care. He was calm and unperturbed from beginning to end, which made You Baiyue a little unwilling to give in.Just as the atmosphere was awkward, Qu Chengchen arrived.Shen Dai remembered the experience of being suppressed by pheromones and his natural fear of top-tier alphas. When Qu Chengchen came over, he immediately felt uneasy.You Baiyue briskly took two big steps towards Qu Chengchen, put his arms around his waist, and said coquettishly, \u201cWhy are you so late.\u201dWe\u2019re sorry for MTLers or people who like using reading mode, but our translations keep getting stolen by aggregators so we\u2019re going to bring back the copy protection.

Shen Dai\u2019s state of mind trembled, \u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201dQu Moyu glanced at Qu Chengchen and You Baiyue, \u201cSince everyone\u2019s here, let\u2019s eat.\u201dAs they walked towards the dining room, Shen Dai said quietly, \u201cFrom his reaction, you probably guessed right.\u201dQu Moyu made a \u201cmn\u201d sound.Shen Dai really wanted to ask whether Qu Moyu have any plans or actions to be taken after knowing this. When they divorce depends on Qu Moyu anyway. However, he knows this is not something he should ask, it has nothing to do with him.After the crowd took their seats, You Xinghai raised his glass and smiled, \u201cToday is a great day. Since we\u2019re at home and in front of so many relatives, I won\u2019t say pretentious words. This first glass is to welcome A-Dai back to this family.\u201dShen Dai looked at You Xinghai without blinking and admired his shamelessness and determination. This is the psychological quality of people who do great things need to have.The recent one, he remembered that when You Xinghai came to him to talk about their \u201ccooperation\u201d, he clearly had no other path yet still chose to put on airs. The distant one, he remembered that 20 years ago, his omega da took him to the You family but was driven out by You Xinghai. That year, he was only seven years old, but he knew what shame was and what it meant to be a disgrace. At least, children are even more sensitive to the emotions of disgust than adults. It was cold that day, and it may have also rained. His dad held him as he cried in the dark night, repeatedly saying how he regretted giving birth to him. He would never forget the helplessness during that moment in his life.He\u2019s not denying that his dad\u2019s fate was largely due to his own fault, but it was still because he initially met You Xinghai, the scumbag who discarded him after making use of him.Now that You Xinghai\u2019s faction is riding on the crest of success, he says he \u201cwelcomes\u201d him back to this family? Of course You Xinghai is pleased. The moment the You family building was about to collapse, he climbed up this big tree, the Qu family. He has both You Baiyue and him in his hands. No matter which one he bets on, he won\u2019t lose. If he could rely on surviving from marriage alliances, let alone welcoming him, even his dad could be respectfully invited in.He looked at You Baiyue again and noticed that You Baiyue was also raising his glass and smiling calmly. Does he not care about the harm his mother has suffered? With this calmness of seeking nothing but profits, they really proved themselves to be blood-related father and son.He felt so disgusted, but could only fake a smile and drink a mouthful of wine.He doesn\u2019t drink very often and has a low tolerance for alcohol. At this moment, in order to escape the social field that made him extremely uncomfortable and the surge of unbearable memories, he could only feed it into his stomach mouthful by mouthful.When dinner was over, Shen Dai felt a little dizzy.\u201cIt\u2019s time to go back.\u201d A magnetic male voice sounded next to his ear, which was accompanied by the fragrance of pheromones that intoxicated him more than alcohol.He raised his head and was met with a pair of deep black eyes. Then he was pulled up by his arm.\u201cSorry.\u201d Shen Dai said with an inflexible tongue, \u201cI\u2019m a little\u2026 I\u2019m not drunk, just a little dizzy.\u201d\u201cMn, let\u2019s go.\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s strong arm crossed the back of Shen Dai\u2019s waist and supported his swaying body. Shen Dai knew he was a little unstable, but more of it was because he didn\u2019t want to be stable. He would rather give up the balance he had learned since he was 1 year old to get closer to Qu Moyu in the name of drunkenness.The two walked out of the You house. When the driver opened the door, Shen Dai hesitated and dared not to get in. He was afraid of the smell of wine on his body and was afraid that he might vomit in the car.Qu Moyu pushed him into the car.Shen Dai said quietly with his eyes closed, his head was hot and confused, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, President Qu, I lost my manners.\u201d\u201cAs long as you know.\u201d Qu Moyu said displeased.As soon as the door was closed, a faint fragrance of epiphyllums mixed with the scent of wine filled the car. Qu Moyu frowned. He doesn\u2019t like this scent. He didn\u2019t like Shen Dai\u2019s pheromone mixed with the scent of wine. He looked at Shen Dai, who tilted his head back. He could see the small bump of his Adam\u2019s apple rolled up and down gently under the skin. Under the dim light, his thoroughly pink skin showed a soft and moist gloss that was like glaze, which had none of his usual composure and restraint.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d Shen Dai was still murmuring an apology. His eyebrows were furrowed, and the tails of his lashes were visibly wet.Qu Moyu suddenly noticed the clear pain that appeared on Shen Dai\u2019s face.Shen Dai did indeed \u201close his manners\u201d today, and the reason why he lost his manners and drank too much is self-evident. When investigating this man\u2019s background, Qu Moyu learned about his past from a few paragraphs. The background data did not come with adjectives, but at this moment, Qu Moyu saw the pain under those words.Qu Moyu handed Shen Dai a bottle of mineral water. Shen Dai took it and drank half a bottle. He lowered a crack in the window and let the wind blow at his forehead. He really wanted to suppress the wine, he didn\u2019t want to be a mess in front of Qu Moyu.\u201cClose the window. It\u2019s too noisy.\u201dShen Dai could only close the window, \u201cPresident Qu\u2026\u201d\u201cStop apologizing.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Borrowing the strength of the wine, Shen Dai\u2019s courage grew, \u201cPresident Qu, do we need to divorce?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou Baiyue, if he\u2019s only temporarily marked, are you going to marry him?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not that free.\u201dShen Dai breathed a sigh of relief, \u201cThen you told me to inquire about this\u2026\u201d\u201cThis information is useful to me.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dThere was a moment of silence.\u201cPresident Qu.\u201d Shen Dai felt as if there were two groups of people sawing away on a two-sided saw in his head. He very much wanted to say the words that came next, but he was also certain that he shouldn\u2019t say them. However, he still said them, \u201cI know You Baiyue\u2019s is a temporary mark because I also had a temporary mark before. You gave it to me, do you remember?\u201dQu Moyu gave no response. He only looked out the window without any expression. The interior of the car was small enough that it was impossible for him to miss it, he seemed to have ignored it.\u201cTemporary marks are similar to permanent marks, but it\u2019s not\u2026\u201d Shen Dai said slowly, \u201cBut I had one before.\u201dAnother long silence.Finally, Shen Dai said quietly, \u201cThank you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShen Dai had already fallen asleep when the car arrive at the Qu house.The driver,\u00a0Lao-Wu, opened the door and stood quietly at one side as he waited for Qu Moyu\u2019s instructions.Lao-Wu is the son of Qu Shen\u2019s driver and was specially trained for Qu Moyu. Since he had such a close relationship with Qu Moyu, he naturally knows all there is to know. However, even though the two are not real husband and wife and he is only a beta, he still did not dare to casually touch someone with the title of Qu Moyu\u2019s wife.Qu Moyu got out of the car, walked around to the side where Shen Dai was, lowered his head, and stared at him for a few seconds. Then he bent down and carried Shen Dai sideways.Shen Dai\u2019s skeleton framework was larger than most male omegas, but he was still light in his arms.Shen Dai opened his eyes briefly in the middle of the swaying movements. He looked at Qu Moyu blankly for a while before closing his eyes again. It seemed as if he was merely looking upon a dream.Uncle Heng hurried over, \u201cYoung master, did Mr. Shen drink too much?\u201d\u201cMn, Aunt Lan, come change his clothes.\u201dAunt Lan ran over, \u201cShould I make some hangover tea?\u201d\u201cHe can\u2019t drink it right now, let him sleep.\u201d Qu Moyu took Shen Dai upstairs, walked into the guest room, and put the man on the bed.When he got back up, Qu Moyu felt a little bit of resistance. Looking down, he found that Shen Dai had grabbed onto the corner of his clothes. All his force was exerted onto the small cloth held between his thumb and index finger. It was very light and careful, yet seemingly stubborn.Qu Moyu frowned slightly, his eyes flickered as he had some thoughts. In the end, he pulled back his clothes effortlessly, \u201cTake good care of him.\u201dWhen Shen Dai woke up, he found that he had overslept. He doesn\u2019t usually need to set an alarm for work and can get up naturally in the morning. However, he didn\u2019t think that he would end up drinking too much.Lying in bed, he reviewed what had happened last night and remembered what he had said to Qu Moyu in the car. He was so vexed that he almost wanted to hit his head against the wall. Why did he say all that! The intention behind the words he said was too obvious. He tried his best to seal himself in front of Qu Moyu, just for the fear of exposing some feelings he shouldn\u2019t have. The best way for him to get along with Qu Moyu is for him to appreciate him from a distance without expectations, just like in the past.What would Qu Moyu think now? Would he think that he is also coveting the mark of a top-tier alpha?But it\u2019s too late for regrets now. He can\u2019t even remember what he said afterward, how he came back, who brought him into the house, and who changed his clothes.However, how Qu Moyu views him actually has no impact on their relationship. Or rather, Qu Moyu has never really \u201cviewed\u201d him properly. These entanglements in his heart were nothing but worries due to his own imagination. He comforted himself in this way, which could be regarded as fighting poison with poison.Shen Dai looked at the time. Even if he got up now and went to the research institute, he could only work for half a day. Moreover, he still had a headache. Thus, he simply sent a message to Cheng Zimei and gave himself a day off.He got up, took a bath, cleaned himself up, and went downstairs to find food. Last night, he was so disgusted by You Xinghai that he couldn\u2019t eat anything and drank a stomach full of alcohol. Now, he was so hungry that his stomach was rumbling.When Uncle Heng saw him, his expression was a little strange, \u201cGood morning, Mr. Shen.\u201dWe\u2019re sorry for MTLers or people who like using reading mode, but our translations keep getting stolen by aggregators so we\u2019re going to bring back the copy protection. If you need to MTL please retype the gibberish parts.Shen Dai didn\u2019t care about his sarcasm, \u201cUncle Heng, I\u2019m hungry. Is there anything to eat?\u201d\u201cLunch is still an hour away. Would you like to wait or eat something first?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll eat something first. Anything will do.\u201d\u201cHow about some cake?\u201d\u201cOkay, thank you.\u201dAfter a while, Aunt Lan brought a glass of milk and two pieces of green bean cake, \u201cMr. Shen, have these as appetizers, there is still a lot of delicious food at lunch.\u201d\u201cThank you, Aunt Lan. Make less for lunch, I can\u2019t eat too much after eating these.\u201d In fact, Shen Dai\u2019s appetite isn\u2019t small, but he feels uncomfortable in the stomach right now. He just wants to eat something to relieve himself.\u201cEat a little more.\u201d Aunt Lan smiled and said, \u201cWhen I changed your pajamas yesterday, aiya, you\u2019re too thin.\u201dShen Dai was a little embarrassed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for giving you trouble.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. What trouble could we have?\u201d Aunt Lan smiled ambiguously. \u201cIt was a little troublesome for the young master though. Last night, the young master\u2026\u201dUncle Heng coughed softly nearby.Aunt Lan ignored him, \u201cLast night, the young master carried you from the car to your room.\u201dShen Dai was slightly stunned, he concealed this by lowering his eyes. He took a bite of the soft glutinous green bean cake and instantly felt the taste of sweetness enter his heart. The previous moment, he was still hoping he could forget all the embarrassment that happened last night, but at this moment, he just wanted to remember every single step that Qu Moyu took as he carried him.\u201cA-Lan, shouldn\u2019t you go watch the kitchen?\u201d Uncle Heng urged, as if he was afraid she would say more.\u201cI\u2019m not the cook. Why should I watch it?\u201dUncle Heng and Aunt Lan are both servants who have been serving Qu Moyu in the old manor since he was a child. After Qu Moyu became independent, he brought them over. Although Uncle Heng is the housekeeper, Aunt Lan is the only servant here that could disobey him.Uncle Heng said in a bad mood, \u201cGo watch the time. There\u2019s traffic today, we need to deliver lunch to the young master a bit earlier.\u201dAunt Lan looked at her watch, \u201cThere\u2019s enough time, Mr. Shen, do you want to see the kitchen? You never say what you like to eat and always say whatever is fine. Then you might as well come to tell the chef directly what you like.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need, this afternoon, I\u2026\u201d\u201cCome on, come on.\u201d Aunt Lan enthusiastically pulled Shen Dai up. \u201cYou\u2019ve moved here for so long but you\u2019ve never been anywhere except the living room, dining room, and your own room.\u201dThe kitchen of the Qu family is frighteningly large. It is divided into the hot meal section and the cold meal section. There was a wall full of lockers, a walk-in refrigerator, a chef and his two apprentices. At this time, the kitchen counter was filled with carefully selected ingredients.After Aunt Lan introduced the chef, she began to introduce today\u2019s dishes, \u201cRecently, the young master has been tired of work meals, so we make food ourselves and send it to him at noon every day. The young master has a light taste but he eats a lot. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have grown so tall.\u201dShen Dai said with a smile, \u201cPresident Qu\u2019s work meals are also sent by the company\u2019s canteen. Actually, our canteen is quite good, but it does get tiring after eating it for a long time.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s impossible to compare with the food from home.\u201d Aunt Lan said to the cook, \u201cXiao-Wang, you have to be on time. Uncle Heng said there\u2019s traffic today and he needs to leave early.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll hurry up.\u201dShen Dai picked up a piece of paper on the counter, on it were the dishes being cooked today.Chef Wang explained, \u201cI wrote this for my apprentices to prepare for the dishes. I might not make all of them.\u201d\u201cMr. Shen, do you know how to cook?\u201d Aunt Lan asked.\u201cI used to cook frequently at home. Later however, there were no conditions for me to do so in the company dormitory.\u201dAunt Lan smiled as she looked at him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you cook a dish for the young master? Let him switch up his taste, it could also save us some time.\u201dUncle Heng who followed them in immediately objected, \u201cA-Lan, how can we let Mr. Shen personally cook? Don\u2019t make trouble for Xiao-Wang.\u201dAunt Lan glared at Uncle Heng, \u201cWhat could go wrong with making a dish, right? Mr. Shen?\u201dShen Dai couldn\u2019t help but be excited, \u201cLet me try.\u201d At this time, his mind was full of \u2014\u2014 Qu Moyu will eat the dishes he personally cooked.\u201cHere, look at these ingredients. You can use whatever you want.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make a shrimp tofu pot, it\u2019s quick.\u201d Shen Dai couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cMy family members all said it\u2019s delicious.\u201dAunt Lan came to help and told him secretly behind Uncle Heng\u2019s back, \u201cPut in less salt. When the young master comes back in the evening, I\u2019ll ask him if he noticed.\u201dShen Dai wasn\u2019t sure about Aunt Lan\u2019s intention, nor dare he speculate, but he can feel that it was out of pure goodwill.Aunt Lan saw through what he was thinking from a single glance and said quietly, \u201cYou guys are already married. Don\u2019t worry about the reason, isn\u2019t it fine to live your days peacefully? I think the young master is also good to you. You need to think of ways to increase his feelings.\u201d\u201cThank you, Aunt Lan.\u201d Shen Dai said sincerely.Shen Dai carefully cooked the dish, sprinkled fresh and tender scallions on top, and then took some pictures from several angles with his phone. Although it was only a homemade dish, the color, smell, and taste were all there. It looked very appetizing. He used to have a wide range of interests and photography was one of them, but because he was carrying debt, only work remained in his life. However, it seems that his skills have not regressed too much. At the very least, the picture he took for the first dish he made for Qu Moyu looked very delicious.This shrimp tofu pot was put into a thermal container. When it\u2019s delivered to Qu Moyu\u2019s hand after a bumpy ride, it must\u2019ve already gone past its most delicious and presentable moment. If,\u00a0if\u00a0he ever gets the opportunity to talk about the taste of this dish with Qu Moyu later, he will take out these pictures and let Qu Moyu see it in its most perfect state. The little joy and expectation at the bottom of his heart are magnified uncontrollably.It was almost ten o\u2019clock in the evening when Shen Dai heard the sound of Qu Moyu\u2019s car. His back was sore from searching for information all afternoon. He has been writing this SCI for half a year now and several important experimental data couldn\u2019t be demonstrated. He was very painfully stuck. He got up from his laptop and went to the window. He stretched his lower back and peeped at Qu Moyu through the gap in the curtain.Hearing the sound of Qu Moyu entering the door, he hesitated for a moment and decided to go downstairs to apologize and thank him for what happened last night.As soon as he opened the door, he heard Qu Moyu scold in a low voice, \u201cDon\u2019t let him cook again, what were you thinking?\u201dShen Dai suddenly froze. He heard Aunt Lan say something in a quiet voice. He couldn\u2019t hear clearly, but her tone was obviously a little aggrieved.Then there were some footsteps.Shen Dai quietly retreated two steps and quietly closed the door. It wasn\u2019t disappointing. After all, this was the reasonable development. At least Qu Moyu ate his dish, this was already pretty good. What more did he want, a five-star review? He just didn\u2019t understand why Qu Moyu had to scold Aunt Lan? This made him feel embarrassed towards Aunt Lan.The next morning, he finished his breakfast as usual, put on his bag, took his bike from the underground lot, and prepared to go to work.When he went out, he bumped into Aunt Lan, who looked at him with some evasion. She never mentioned what happened yesterday so he also pretended that nothing had happened.When he pushed his bike through the courtyard, Uncle Heng was watering the flowers. When he saw him, he came over, \u201cGood morning, Mr. Shen.\u201d\u201cGood morning, Uncle Heng. You continue working, I\u2019ll be leaving.\u201d\u201cMr. Shen.\u201d Uncle Heng said, \u201cCan I tell you a few things?\u201dShen Dai intuitively didn\u2019t want to hear these things, but he had nowhere to hide. He could only park his bike and looked at Uncle Heng calmly.\u201cWhen the young master came back last night, A-Lan told him you cooked for him. The young master was unhappy and scolded A-Lan. A-Lan has brought the young master up from childhood and the young master rarely ever spoke loudly to her.\u201dShen Dai lowered his eyes and waited for him to continue.Uncle Heng\u2019s tone was very gentle, \u201cA-Lan never got much education and has always been working in the mansion. She is relatively simple and has been taking care of the young master for more than 20 years. There\u2019s nothing to complain about the way she takes care of his daily life. However, she doesn\u2019t realize that she and the young master are not people from the same world. We can\u2019t be using her ideas trying to get into the young master\u2019s mind. If I didn\u2019t tell her, she wouldn\u2019t even know why the young master was angry.\u201dShen Dai said lightly, \u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201d\u201cYou were educated and you\u2019re so intelligent. In fact, you probably already understand everything. The young master is only nice to you because of his refinement. However, the young master does not want you to have any unnecessary ideas about him. He will feel troubled.\u201dShen Dai felt a burst of heat from his cheeks. His hand subconsciously wanted to find the large pocket of his lab coat, but the sweater on his body had no pockets, leaving him at a loss.Uncle Heng sighed, \u201cPlease don\u2019t think I\u2019m harsh. I know you\u2019re a decently good person from getting along with you through this period of time. I respect you very much so I don\u2019t want you to get hurt. The world of top-tier alphas is not something ordinary people like us can understand. There are too many people who like the young master, but the young master doesn\u2019t need any specific person, he only needs to find the most valuable helper for him in the future.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But people will deceive themselves, they will bargain, escape, get lucky, and will let reason and sensibility fight endlessly like a dilemma.He must become more restrained. At the very least, he shouldn\u2019t become Qu Moyu\u2019s \u201ctroublesomeness\u201d.One of his juniors walked over and interrupted Shen Dai\u2019s gloominess, \u201cShen-shixiong, laoshi asked you to go to his office.\u201d\u201cOkay, thanks.\u201dProfessor Liu Xi is one of the most influential experts in the field of international rare earth research and also Shen Dai\u2019s mentor. Under his leadership, Shen Dai was selected into the talent plan and entered Xingzhou, the top Rare Earths Research Institute in China. What makes Shen Dai admire him the most is not only his contribution in the academic circles, but also because he is a beta that broke his way through a crowd of alphas.\u201cLaoshi.\u201d Shen Dai entered the office and picked up Liu Xi\u2019s teacup. \u201cHow many times have I told you not to make such strong tea, it\u2019s bad for your health. You also water the flowers with it all the time, killing one pot after another.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s not enough taste if it\u2019s light.\u201d Liu Xi pulled out a manuscript from a pile of documents. \u201cThe materials of the investors\u2019 meeting are well written.\u201dShen Dai said with a smile, \u201cThank you, laoshi.\u201d\u201cSince it\u2019s written by you, you sub in for me and give the speech this time.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dWe\u2019re sorry for MTLers or people who like using reading mode, but our translations keep getting stolen by aggregators so we\u2019re going to bring back the copy protection.

You have attended the meeting before, just talk about our achievements and future plans. In fact, many of them won\u2019t even understand.\u201dThe so-called investors\u2019 meeting is an annual work report to the senior management, major shareholders, and shareholders\u2019 representatives of the group. Their team takes hundreds of millions of funds every year, of course they have to let the payers know what they have been doing. This is a very important meeting.This means that as CEO, Qu Moyu will definitely attend.Shen Dai said reluctantly, \u201cLaoshi, you\u2019re too trusting. This is the investors\u2019 meeting. What if they ask me some tricky questions, aren\u2019t you afraid that I won\u2019t be able to hold us up? They may not understand rare earths, but they know about the financial report.\u201d\u201cWe do have achievements this year though? Since we have achievements, we should have more confidence. What\u2019s there to be afraid of?\u201d Liu Xi slapped the table with firm eyes. \u201cYou need to keep up an imposing manner, okay? If they talk about money, you will just mention the future returns. Just counter their attacks. It\u2019ll be alright as long as there\u2019s no huge problem. The superiors gave me words saying they won\u2019t cut the budget this year, which is why I dare to leave.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Fine, then when will you be back?\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s intuition told him that this level wasn\u2019t so easy. In the investment stage, investors often intentionally throw out some difficult problems, which, to them, can be regarded as a type of psychological compensation. Since a sound could still be heard if the money was merely thrown into the water, yet it was being thrown at scientific research that could be found everywhere and haven\u2019t seen results in eight to ten years.\u201cI don\u2019t know. This mine hasn\u2019t proved its reserves, but the contents of neodymium and dysprosium are not low. I might stay for a while. Your seniors are camping in Gansu again. I\u2019ll have to leave this place to you and Zimei for the time being.\u201d\u201cOkay, laoshi can rest assured.\u201dIn order to prepare for his speech, Shen Dai has been working late these days. This was more nerve-wracking than his thesis defense. If he screws up the defense, it\u2019s merely his own business, but screwing up the investors\u2019 meeting will drag down the whole team. Although his teacher told him to be relaxed, he didn\u2019t dare to neglect it at all.One night, Shen Dai and Qu Moyu came home at the same time \u2014\u2014 the two haven\u2019t met face to face since that day.Shen Dai nodded and said, \u201cHello President Qu.\u201d He thought that since Qu Moyu would not mention that trivial dish, nor would he, it would be just as if nothing had happened. Which is the case for what he said when he was drunk and his self-assertiveness after sobering up.\u201cComing back so late, was it overtime?\u201d Qu Moyu asked casually.\u201cYes, there\u2019s been more overtime recently.\u201d\u201cI heard that Professor Liu asked you to give the speech for the investors\u2019 meeting.\u201d\u201cYes, laoshi is in a hurry to go prospecting in South Africa.\u201d Shen Dai joked, \u201cI\u2019m quite nervous. Please go easy on me when the time comes.\u201d\u201cYou have to face not only me, but also the senior management, the shareholders, and the shareholders\u2019 representatives.\u201d Qu Moyu lowered his head to look at Shen Dai. \u201cBe well-prepared, don\u2019t get stage fright, and just say whatever you have. I will give them my greetings.\u201d\u201cThank you, President Qu.\u201d Shen Dai felt warm in his heart. With Qu Moyu being so perfect, the fact that it\u2019s impossible not to like him wasn\u2019t Qu Moyu\u2019s flaw, it was his.\u201cThe topic from your team has the most potential from the research institute. The board of directors are very optimistic about it and will not cut your budget. If the prospecting in South Africa goes well, it may even be increased.\u201dShen Dai said with joy, \u201cThat\u2019s great, laoshi is very confident about the mine in South Africa.\u201dQu Moyu nodded, \u201cRest early.\u201dShen Dai said quietly, \u201cGood night.\u201d As soon as these two words came out, a burst of both sourness and sweetness filled his heart. Good night is different from good morning. People always say good morning to people at school or work, but the ones people say good night to are usually someone close, thus, it gave these two words a hazy romantic ambiguity.For the first time, he said good night to Qu Moyu openly.When he went home on the weekend, Shen Dai brought over some vegetables and daily necessities like usual, but as soon as he entered the door, he felt that the atmosphere at home wasn\u2019t right. Grandma was sitting on the sofa waiting for him with a long face.\u201cGrandma, you haven\u2019t cooked yet? Then I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\u201cNo need to hurry.\u201d Grandma patted the spot beside her, \u201cCome here and let\u2019s talk.\u201dShen Dai knew he couldn\u2019t escape this level. The moment he sat down, he decided to tell the truth.\u201cWhere did you get so much money and suddenly pay off the debt?\u201d Grandma showed an expression of her thinking it was unbelievable. \u201cWhen I got the call, I thought it was a scam. The last time you took me to see the doctor, you said you got a bonus. How is it possible for you to get such a high bonus?\u201d\u201cGrandma, don\u2019t be anxious, let\u2019s talk through this slowly.\u201dGrandma took a deep breath, \u201cOkay, we can talk slowly, but you must tell me the truth.\u201dShen Dai nodded. \u201cThe reason I didn\u2019t tell you is was because I don\u2019t know how to say it. I was also scared that you\u2019ll get angry.\u201d\u201cTh- this money, did it come righteously?\u201d Grandma clenched her hands nervously.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s absolutely righteous.\u201d Shen Dai hurriedly said, \u201cDon\u2019t make blind guesses. In fact, this money was\u2026 given to me by the You family.\u201dGrandma widened her eyes and suddenly spoke in a harsh tone, \u201cYou family?!\u201d She hates You Xinghai to the bone because You Xinghai ruined her son.\u201cGrandma.\u201d Shen Dai took grandma\u2019s hand and said softly, \u201cWill you listen to me?\u201dGrandma lowered her head slowly, her chest was still fluctuating, \u201cWhy did the You family give you so much money? It\u2019s impossible. Why?\u201d\u201cThe reason may sound hard to believe, but it\u2019s true.\u201d Shen Dai gave a brief account of his need to fulfill the engagement for You Baiyue, but hid Qu Moyu\u2019s name.Grandma was silent for a long time, her grip on Shen Dai\u2019s hand became painful, but she still did not say a word. A moment later, she quietly shed tears.Shen Dai\u2019s heart twitched in follow-up, he gently wiped grandma\u2019s tears, \u201cGrandma, I know you don\u2019t want me to have anything to do with the You family, and I never thought of looking for him, but we really do need money right now. This cooperation doesn\u2019t hurt me, I can work and live as usual, as well as pay off the debts. We can even use the remaining money to switch up the house and for your treatment. This money has helped us a lot.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Grandma said chokingly, \u201cIt\u2019s because I know that I\u2019m unhappy. You shouldn\u2019t be bearing these. Although that scumbag is hateful, the reason your dad has become like that was because your grandfather and I didn\u2019t bring him up well. You are innocent, yet you had to be the one to make money and support the family. You even had to use your major life event as payment, which delayed you everything.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not delaying anything. We will be dissolving our marriage soon, when their cooperation is completed, which should be soon.\u201d Shen Dai forced out a smile. \u201cGrandma, think about the good sides. These are all good things. The You family is becoming worse and worse in recent years, they even have a son that won\u2019t free them from worry. We took his money and saw his miserable times, doesn\u2019t it feel good?\u201d\u201cHe gave you 10 million, such a large sum of money, he really only told you to get a marriage certificate?\u201d Grandma said anxiously, \u201cWith a creature like You Xinghai, I\u2019m really worried he has different intentions.\u201d\u201cNo, he looked for me because he had no other choice. Now I have the money and even spent it, what else can he do to me?\u201dGrandma shook her head with a sad face, \u201cI hope so. Then your\u2026 the person you married, who is he? And how does he treat you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a stranger. I haven\u2019t even seen him much. He\u2019s polite.\u201d Shen Dai stroked grandma\u2019s thin back. \u201cOur cooperation will not last too long. When things are finished and we\u2019re divorced, it\u2019ll just be an extra marriage history. Such a small price for us to live a normal life, isn\u2019t it a good deal?\u201d Although the former half was a lie, the latter half is the truth. The contract says five years, which is to fully protect Qu Moyu\u2019s benefits. In fact, it wouldn\u2019t take that long. Before long, the only false connection between him and Qu Moyu will disappear.Grandma sighed, \u201cDon\u2019t get too close to people of the You family.\u201dShen Dai thought of You Baiyue and somehow also thought of Qu Chengchen. He frowned slightly, \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Grandma looked like she wanted to speak but hesitated, \u201cIf you get married, although it\u2019s cooperation, will the other want you to\u2026\u201dShen Dai immediately understood grandma\u2019s hesitation, \u201cNo, I already told you. I haven\u2019t even seen him much. We don\u2019t contact each other without business.\u201dOnly then was grandma was relieved, \u201cThat\u2019s good, that\u2019s good. Omegas are the easiest to be at a disadvantage. No matter what you do, you need to have proper limits. Learn from your father\u2019s failure.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s eyes darkened. No one understood better than him, because he was the price of that mistake. He was forced to use his life to bear the consequences of mistakes that he did not commit, he said in a deep voice, \u201cI understand.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 13": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe network of the laboratory broke down today. Since it needed to be checked and repaired, Shen Dai left his shift in advance, which was rare. Because he became familiar with Aunt Lan, he would occasionally mention some dishes he liked. After eating takeout for several days, right now, he wants to try the good skills of the Qu family\u2019s chef.Just as he stepped into the door of the Qu house, he felt the unusual atmosphere.A beautiful, elegant lady with a refined temperament sat in the living room. She was wearing a black dress and a glittering pearl necklace. Her beautiful hair was scrupulously styled behind her head. She was of high maintenance and could hardly hide her brilliance, just like a noblewoman coming out of an oil painting.Shen Dai could guess with a glance that this was Qu Moyu\u2019s mother.As soon as he entered the room, everyone looked at him with a kind of strange look that was hard to describe. It was as if this was a scene where he had accidentally intruded into their race, as if his appearance here was inexplicable.Although he knew many people here, when the woman appeared with her gestures as the master, the magnetic field of the whole room changed to surround her.\u201cShen Dai, right?\u201d She smiled faintly.\u201cHello.\u201d Shen Dai bowed slightly, \u201cMadam Qu.\u201d\u201cCome sit down.\u201dShen Dai didn\u2019t sit on the sofa in the living room often. The seemingly rare cream-colored leather looked like it was easy to get dirty. He had been using the backpack on his back since University, although it was sturdy and easy to use, it was a little dirty. When he sat down, he put his backpack at his feet.He noticed that Uncle Heng and Aunt Lan both had subtle worrisome expressions on their faces.Madam Qu\u2019s bright eyes swept up and down as they quickly sized him up, \u201cYou\u2019re 27? You look quite young, like a college student.\u201dShen Dai smiled.\u201cYou work in the research institute? It\u2019s difficult to enter the Research Institute of Xingzhou. Are you a master or a doctor?\u201d\u201cMaster, I\u2019m preparing to study for a doctor these next two years.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing for an omega to do this. Who else is in your family?\u201dWe\u2019re sorry for MTLers or people who like using reading mode, but our translations keep getting stolen by aggregators so we\u2019re going to bring back the copy protection. If you need to MTL please retype the gibberish parts.\u201cOnly my grandma.\u201d In his heart, he has already prescribed his missing father as dead.\u201cOh.\u201d Madam Qu slowly took a sip of tea. \u201cWhat\u2019s your pheromone level?\u201d\u201cLevel B.\u201d\u201cOh it\u2019s not high.\u201d Madam Qu\u2019s voice has been warm and soft since the start, \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to produce a top-tier alpha.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Shen Dai will not spare a glance at an omega\u2019s pheromone level, because the levels of omegas are different from that of the alphas. The ability to reproduce occupies a very large proportion and on the contrary; physical fitness, intelligence, talent, and genetic diseases, which are very important to every human being, have become non-essential conditions. Unfortunately, linking the value of omegas with fertility has been a tradition throughout human history. He considers himself to be smarter, healthier, and more diligent than most people. Although the unstableness of his glands leads to lower fertility, he doesn\u2019t care at all. He doesn\u2019t agree with this grading method, so naturally, he doesn\u2019t feel inferior for it.Madam Qu looked at Shen Dai\u2019s indifferent appearance and was a little surprised, \u201cDo you not care?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care much.\u201d Shen Dai thought, my low pheromone level has nothing to do with your Qu family.Madam Qu smiled, \u201cI know you and Moyu are not in a normal marital relationship, but you\u2019re still living together after all. It\u2019s inevitable for youngsters to have some ideas when they see each other so frequently. Moreover, Moyu has always been very\u2026\u201d She used an implicit statement, \u201cAttractive.\u201dAs expected, it was another one that came to beat him up. Do they really think a S-level alpha is someone that could be seduced or forced on? These anti-theft measures almost made Shen Dai\u2019s sense of humiliation and discomfort rush to the top. After three months of marriage with Qu Moyu, he did not do a single thing, yet he had been warned either openly or implicitly by Lawyer Chen, Qu Moyu himself, You Baiyue, Uncle Heng, and Madam Qu. They warned him against coveting the person who he was far from being worthy of even delusional of.It\u2019s true that he isn\u2019t worthy, but he didn\u2019t have delusions.Whenever his self-esteem was violated, he could only comfort himself with:\u00a0it\u2019s only a means of earning money, it\u2019s not embarrassing.Uncle Heng and Aunt Lan send a comforting look to Shen Dai. Shen Dai nodded almost undetectably. He looked directly into Madam Qu\u2019s eyes and said, \u201cI respect President Qu very much. Whether at the company or home, we will only have an em, ploy, ment, re, la, tion, ship.\u201dThere was some ignorant grief in Madam Qu\u2019s eyes, \u201cI don\u2019t have any ill intentions, but it\u2019s just that, this is really not a world that an ordinary omega can integrate into.\u201dQu Moyu came home during this moment. His footsteps were in a hurry and the floor tiles sounded with\u00a0dadadas. People wouldn\u2019t be in such a hurry when they came home, except when something\u2019s happening.\u201cMother.\u201d When Qu Moyu saw Madam Qu, it was visible that he adjusted his breathing, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201dMadam Qu lightly tucked her drooping hair behind her ear, \u201cMy son got married and nobody told me. Can\u2019t I come to see my daughter-in-law?\u201dQu Moyu gave Shen Dai a look, \u201cGo back to your room first.\u201dShen Dai was about to get up, but was stopped by Madam Qu, \u201cIt\u2019s all right, sit and chat.\u201dWhoever pays him is the boss, of course Shen Dai listened to Qu Moyu. He got up, bowed, turned, and left.Madam Qu wasn\u2019t annoyed at this, she gently shook her head, \u201cI thought you would marry Xiao-Yue.\u201d\u201cWho Xiao-Yue liked has always been Chengchen, you knew this.\u201d\u201cOh? You still care about like or not?\u201d There was a certain sarcasm in that tone.This was the last conversation Shen Dai heard before walking down the stairs. He couldn\u2019t help but be surprised, You Baiyue has always liked Qu Chengchen? Although liking Qu Chengchen\u2019s mark can be regarded as liking, what Qu Moyu expressed seems to have a different meaning. It was that more common, literal meaning of \u201clike\u201d. In addition, Madam Qu\u2019s question in reply was also very thought-provoking.Shen Dai returned to his room, and the moment he closed the door, he instantly felt safe. Not only was he unable to integrate into the world of top-tier alphas, but even his room seemed to be in a different dimension from the whole villa. Nevertheless, he still opened the gap between time and space every night to take a peek at Qu Moyu.Shen Dai worked late into the night and still didn\u2019t feel sleepy. The irritation in his heart did not dissipate because of the appearance of Madam Qu. He hesitated for a while and decided to take a swim in the heated pool.He usually doesn\u2019t dare to use the swimming pool, because before he moved in, Uncle Heng expressed that it\u2019s better to avoid being in the same space as Qu Moyu as much as possible. However, at this time, Qu Moyu must be asleep.Shen Dai went downstairs wrapped in his bathrobe. He estimated that he would swim at least two kilometers, with that, he would be tired enough to fall asleep easily.He put his phone on the coffee table, took off his bathrobe, and began to warm up. Just after a round of stretching, the elevator door opened. He was surprised to see Qu Moyu walk out wearing only swimming trunks.Qu Moyu was also stunned for a bit.Qu Moyu had a figure as tall and sturdy as a sculpture. His muscle mass seemed much more thick and solid than when he was seen covered with clothes. His lines are rich and proper, especially the most important part protruding from the elastic cloth. He had a perfect physique.Shen Dai\u2019s mind instantly burned. He hurriedly picked up the bathrobe and put it on his body, but the solid-colored bathrobe made him unable to find its right side up. The more anxious he was, the more he couldn\u2019t find it, which made him look particularly discomposed.Qu Moyu couldn\u2019t hold it in and chuckled.Shen Dai\u2019s face became as red as if he was cooked. He finally found the direction of the collar, put it on quickly, and then tightened his belt with a fierce force that seemed to be punishing his stupidity.\u201cAre you going to swim in your bathrobe?\u201d Qu Moyu joked, \u201cTowel cloth is very absorbent.\u201d\u201cPresident Qu, you have fun. I\u2019ll be going back to my room.\u201dQu Moyu tilted his head to look at him, \u201cAre you afraid of me?\u201dShen Dai didn\u2019t dare to look at Qu Moyu, \u201cUncle Heng said you don\u2019t like to be disturbed.\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d Qu Moyu walked towards the pool and when he walked by Shen Dai, he smelled the faint fragrance of epiphyllums again. The blooming period of epiphyllums is erratic and hasty, its fragrance is unlike that of roses or lavenders, it can form a complete memory point in the hearts of the common people. Everyone can smell and recognize flowers, and everyone can form a fixed smell in their mind just by seeing the name of flowers. But epiphyllums are too rare and too short-lived, not many people are able to distinguish them. However, as long as they smell it once, the fragrance that becomes more and more fragrant in its process growing from a bud to full bloom, from simple and elegant to strong and thick, from restrained and reserved to debauched and dissolute, it seems to be trying its best to do everything just for its one time of bloom. When it blooms, it requires all living creatures to stop for it.He glanced at Shen Dai\u2019s smooth neck with the corner of his eyes. It was thin and pale, which gave people a trace of the desire to wreck it.When Shen Dai walked to the elevator, Qu Moyu called out to stop him. As soon as Shen Dai turned around, Qu Moyu jumped into the water with a plop. He was stunned in his place, not knowing if he should leave or stay.After a while, Qu Moyu got out of the water. He wiped his wet hair with one hand, lay by the poolside, and said, \u201cNow that you can\u2019t see it, there\u2019s no need to be nervous, right?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t take what my mother said to you to heart.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Shen Dai said calmly.\u201cThen you can go back to bed.\u201dShen Dai turned around and took two steps, but then he halted. He put his hand into the pocket of his bathrobe and turned back, \u201cPresident Qu.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cTowards you, I\u2026\u201d Shen Dai forced himself to look directly at Qu Moyu. \u201cI don\u2019t have any ideas beyond the scope of the contract. You can rest assured.\u201d So there\u2019s no need to let anyone else come embarrass me, whether you intended it or not.Qu Moyu stared at Shen Dai. The water ripples reflected into the bottom of his eyes, making his eyes extraordinarily bright and transparent. It was as if just two pupils were enough to see through everything in the world, he smiled faintly, \u201cOkay.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShen Dai devoted all his energy to preparing his speech. These past few days, his diet, sleep, and mental health weren\u2019t very good. He was easily tired and didn\u2019t have much appetite. In the beginning, he thought it was because he was too tired at work. But three days later, he became worried because these were the symptoms all adult omegas were familiar with \u2014\u2014 they were like the premonitions of one\u2019s heat.The heat period of normal omegas is relatively regular, they\u2019ll come every three or four months. Although the timing won\u2019t be 100% precise, it won\u2019t be off by too much. Their bodies will start to self-regulate in advance. For example, the loss of appetite is from emptying the womb in preparation for conception, while insomnia and mental anxiety are the manifestations of pheromone fluctuations. Shen Dai\u2019s heat only occurs once or twice a year when the climate is warm. Unless induced by external stimulation such as alpha pheromones, almost no omega would go into heat when it\u2019s very cold. This genetic embodiment is similar to animals \u2014\u2014 cubs born in winter will not easily survive. However, they are just entering winter right now and it\u2019s not very cold. It\u2019s totally possible for him to go into heat at this time.Shen Dai was frightened by this possibility. Although he would also have these symptoms when he\u2019s working under great pressure, he did not dare to take this risk. He went to the pharmacy and bought some medicine to suppress and delay his heat. This medicine acts directly on the glands, it\u2019s bad to metabolize and hurts the health. It\u2019s usually only taken in cases of emergencies.Sure enough, after taking the medicine, those symptoms lifted quite a lot on the same day. In a few days however, his heat period would fight back again. Knowing this, Shen Dai asked for leave in advance and decided to go home right after his speech.The night before the speech, he remembered that he hadn\u2019t prepared his clothes yet. Fortunately, Uncle Heng ordered several suits for him last time. He held the three-piece suit wrapped in the dust bag and waited for the taxi at the door. The wind was strong today, which made his eyes dry.As he rubbed his eyes, a car slowly stopped in front of him. When he opened his eyes again, he saw Qu Moyu\u2019s car.Lao-Wu, the driver, got out of the car and opened the back door for him, \u201cMr. Shen, we are also on the way to the company right now. The young master told you to get in the car.\u201d\u201cOh, thank you.\u201d After Shen Dai got in the car, he hung up the suit. \u201cThank you, President Qu. I should have taken my suit over in advance, I forgot.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d Qu Moyu was reading the briefing, \u201cThe solvent extraction method that your team broke through this year has a good separation effect on the lighter rare earths, but there\u2019s no substantial progress for the heavier rare earths.\u201d\u201cYes, mainly because heavy rare earths are particularly difficult to control in the process of fractional precipitation and crystallization, which is also one of the main directions we will work towards in the future.\u201d\u201cShareholders will definitely ask questions in this regard, but you can avoid the market application of this technology, which involves profit return. At the same time, they are very interested in the South African mine newly invested by the company this year.\u201d\u201cUnderstood, I have already prepared for this part. After laoshi went to South Africa, he also sent a lot of valuable information.\u201d\u201cProfessor Liu isn\u2019t worried at all by leaving the laboratory to you? It seems that he values you most.\u201dWe\u2019re sorry for MTLers or people who like using reading mode, but our translations keep getting stolen by aggregators so we\u2019re going to bring back the copy protection. If you need to MTL please retype the gibberish parts.\u201cP\u2019w cba atf bcf njiefv atf wbra.\u201d Vtfc Gjl rjlv ogjcxis, \u201cJeggfcais, atf wlcf lc Xjcre lr atf wjlc qgbola rbegmf bo atf mbwqjcs\u2019r gjgf fjgat fifwfca rfmabg jcv ws rfclbgr jgf jii ja atf gfrfjgmt lcralaeaf atfgf.

Let me remind you, first, Qu Chengchen will be attending this meeting on behalf of my uncle today, and second, most of the attendees today are alphas. You had better not let them see through your gender.\u201dShen Dai sighed in his heart, \u201cI understand.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s reminders are very realistic. Omegas have weak characteristics and low physical fitness, they easily get pregnant and have heat periods four times a year for seven days. Thus, they are at the bottom of the labor market. For large and medium-sized companies, the labor law has strict requirements on the employment rate of omegas, and they can help companies avoid taxes. As a result, there are quite a lot of omegas in Xingzhou, but very few have important positions. In short, since omegas are already struggling in the workplace, they are even rarer in the field of scientific research. Shen Dai was one who proved himself by relying on his achievements. Some alphas think highly of themselves and have prejudice and discrimination in their bones. They are likely to question his professionalism. He was already mentally prepared in this regard.Qu Moyu\u2019s car was parked in the exclusive parking space and he went directly to his office from the internal elevator. Shen Dai walked through half the parking lot and took the employee elevator. The entire way there, he kept looking left and right for fear of being seen.When he arrived at the dormitory, he changed into his suit. He twisted around in front of the mirror to look at the back of his neck. Pheromone stickers are all skin colors, which could only be seen from a close distance. Recently, he didn\u2019t have time to cut his hair. Therefore, the tips of his hair and collar conveniently covered it, which can be counted as having it concealed. He nodded to himself in the mirror, then took his laptop and the materials with him out the door.The meeting officially began at 9:30. Currently, there are five teams in the institute. Since he\u2019s the third one presenting, he can still go through the PowerPoint several times.Entering the conference hall, his juniors cheered in unison, \u201cHoly, Shen-shixiong is so handsome today.\u201d\u201cFirst time seeing Shen-shixiong in a suit, he\u2019s so charismatic, he really doesn\u2019t look like a dirt digger at all.\u201dThey ridicule themselves as \u201cdirt diggers\u201d because they associate with various minerals and chemical reagents daily, it\u2019s very common to get dirty.Cheng Zimei applauded exaggeratedly, \u201cA-Dai, you look so good in a suit. This waist, these legs, tsk tsk.\u201dShen Dai became shy from their praises, \u201cThanks for the flatter, everyone. When I go up later, you guys must also clap this hard for me.\u201d As expected, people need to rely on clothes. This suit was expensive and tailor-made, of course it looks good. He thought about when he\u2019ll be giving the speech, everyone\u2019s eyes will fall on him, including Qu Moyu, who rarely looks at him. Qu Moyu might be looking at him for a long time, longer than all the time in the past added together. Would he also think he looks good too?\u201cShen-shixiong, sit here.\u201d His alpha shidi, Zhou Lan, got up and gave him the middle position.\u201cNo need, I\u2019ll sit on the side, it\u2019ll be easier to go out later.\u201d After Shen Dai took his seat, he opened his laptop.Zhou Lan unscrewed the bottle of water and next to Shen Dai\u2019s hand, \u201cShixiong, drink some water. Have you had breakfast? Should I buy some for you?\u201d\u201cI ate, how about you guys?\u201d Shen Dai asked casually.\u201cWe ate, the canteen came up with a new ham mooncake, it\u2019s so good.\u201dShen Dai nodded, but his eyes remained on the screen, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll try it another day.\u201dIt\u2019s not the first day Zhou Lan has been so eagerly attentive. As an engineering man, the way he makes advances is somewhat clumsy, but Shen Dai could still see his intention and felt a bit of a headache. In the past, he didn\u2019t accept those who had dropped hints at him because he owed so much money that there was no way for him to date. Now, it\u2019s even more impossible. Unfortunately, this shidi was too young to understand his silent refusal.He might as well wait a few days later to let Cheng Zimei help him deal with this.Other scientific research groups, leaders, and shareholders arrived one after another. Soon, the huge conference hall was full of people.Shen Dai saw many senior executives of the company, but his eyes had been following Qu Moyu since the start. Qu Moyu was wearing a three-piece suit and a black windbreaker that brought wind as he walked. The entire time, Qu Moyu talked with the shareholders around him and did not look over.Qu Chengchen also arrived. He was also dressed in a suit and was carrying a gray briefcase. He was still talking on the phone as he walked. It was completely different from the cynical look when they met last time. This time, he looked very serious and respectable.\u201cWow, it\u2019s rare for both the Crown Prince and the Royal Prince to appear at the same time.\u201d Cheng Zimei\u2019s gossip soul possessed her once again. She bumped Shen Dai with her elbow. \u201cWe should get to know some colleagues from the chemical department so that we can hear about the Royal Prince\u2019s gossip. He is much more interesting than our Crown Prince.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bother me. I have to go over the script one more time.\u201d Shen Dai said as he stared at the computer screen.\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, okay? Laoshi said that this meeting will not affect our budget. Just talk about it casually.\u201d\u201cHow can things be done \u2018casually\u2019.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really\u2026 Wow!\u201d Cheng Zimei grabbed Shen Dai\u2019s arm excitedly, and Shen Dai was pinched to the point of pain.There was a small commotion in the conference hall, and everyone\u2019s eyes turned towards the door. An extremely handsome alpha walked in, and many high-level leaders who had already taken their seats got up to greet him.\u201cIt\u2019s Yan Mingxiu!\u201d A shimei said excitedly, \u201cWhy is he here?\u201d\u201cLongke Heavy Industry is a strategic partner of our company, he probably also has some shares.\u201dShen Dai was also curious and stretched his neck to see Yan Mingxiu\u2019s elegant appearance. Yan Mingxiu is the successor of Longke Heavy Industry, which isn\u2019t unusual. What\u2019s unusual is that he suddenly entered the entertainment industry in his early twenties. His acting skills are average, but he became popular for a bit relying on his god-like visuals and his superior genes as an S-class alpha. Then he suddenly disappeared from the public eye after two to three years. It was obvious that it was the case of a young, frivolous, and pampered son of a wealthy family who went to play around in the pompous Vanity Fair and had to eventually go back to inherit the family.Yan Mingxiu is the representative of having top-tier visuals among top-tier alphas. Seeing the real person is more shocking than from the big screen.\u201cThe alpha concentration here is too high.\u201d Cheng Zimei shrugged. \u201cFortunately, I can\u2019t smell it. I\u2019ll be fine with just looking at handsome guys. A-Dai, will you feel unwell?\u201dBetas have the largest population base and create the most social value, it\u2019s indeed the most stable and convenient gender. Although they also cannot bear the suppression of alpha pheromones, they also cannot smell pheromones and are rarely affected in daily situations. For example, at this moment, when three S-level alphas and a pile of other alphas appear together in an indoor space at the same time, with their pheromones flying around the entire room, it\u2019s very oppressive for omegas.Of course Shen Dai was uncomfortable. He felt that the air was air, tightness in his chest, and shortness of breath. Even his eyes were smoked dry. However, it\u2019s a bit much to say there are substantive harms, it\u2019s just really uncomfortable. The omega gender is too pathetic, no wonder it\u2019s hard to get a job. He nodded and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go out for a bit, let me know when it\u2019s my turn.\u201dNot long after the first group started, he sneaked out with his laptop under the excuse of going to the bathroom. He breathed some fresh air in the coffee break area and continued to look through his PowerPoint.It was not until Cheng Zimei called him on the phone that he returned to the conference hall. He got himself ready and stepped onto the stage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 15": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShen Dai briefly introduced himself, and then started the report speech.Although the teacher told him not to be too nervous, he did not dare to be relaxed at all. He was almost all prepared for this moment. The golden masters sitting under the stage not only determined the budget of the project team, but also very likely to become an investor in his own independent project in the future, he is very grateful to the teacher for giving him this opportunity.The discomfort caused by too many alphas gathered in one room was overshadowed by excitement the moment he picked up the microphone. His eyes unconsciously found Qu Moyu, who was sitting in the first row. As expected, Qu Moyu was looking at him, only looking at him. After sensing his gaze, he nodded lightly. Shen Dai received great encouragement, he straightened his chest, took a deep breath, showed a calm smile, and started his speech. He switched to the ppt and occasionally read the prompt words in his hand. From a very professional point of view, he explained their scientific research achievements and future plans in the past year in as simple and easy-to-understand language as possible.Qu Moyu stared intently at the handsome and tall young man on the stage. He was confident, generous and eloquent. His fair skin was brighter and full of moist lustre under the spotlight. His eyes were clear and full of rich knowledge. The tailored dark blue suit perfectly outlines his physique, which is looking like somewhere between an adult and a teenager.The whole speech lasted for about 40 minutes, and as the time went on, Shen Dai felt a little tighter in his chest. Although alphas in public places will control pheromones and put stickers on them. But when there are too many of them and the space is not well ventilated, a lot of pheromones will inevitably be mixed. Shen Dai drank water frequently and finished the speech while keeping his mind awake.And the real challenge may have just begun, because in the next moment, he has to answer investors\u2019 questions.A shareholder was the first to ask the question Qu Moyu had asked him in the morning, and Shen Dai explained his answer. Someone asked when this upgraded extraction method could be put into use and when the market returns could be seen. Shen Dai also patiently explained their plan according to the content given by the teacher. The South African mine has attracted widespread attention from investors. Shen Dai was well prepared. He asked his teacher to record a video in the mining area two days ago. The teacher introduced the current prospecting situation and future prospects of the mine. The teacher appeared on the stage so it is more convincing.Suddenly, Qu Chengchen raised the pen in his hand, and then turned on the microphone in front of him, and Shen Dai was also ready for his question.\u201cHello, Shen Gong.\u201d Qu Chengchen nodded with a smile, and then scribbled on the scrap paper in front of him with notes written on it with a pen, \u201cYour speech was well done. I have summed up a few questions for you to answer.\u201d\u201cPlease speak.\u201dQu Chengchen said solemnly: \u201cYou mentioned in your speech that your team has tried a new chlorination method in the decomposition of concentrate. This chlorination method can improve the efficiency to a certain extent in the traditional pretreatment, but it is not suitable for a budget this large. Pretreatment is a step with a relatively low technical threshold. The acid method, alkali method or chlorination method used in various countries are similar in time, cost and loss. I am very concerned about rare earth. I definitely am not as well understood as you, but in my opinion, it is not worth spending money on improving the pre-processing method. The Group expects you to be more innovative, more efficient, and lower-loss extraction technology. I hope you can explain this.\u201d\u201cYour question is very valuable. At first, we hoped to realise our ideal in the extraction process in the most cost-effective way, but then we encountered many obstacles. If we do not do well enough in this step of decomposing the concentrate, wit will affect several subsequent steps. If this problem is explained from a professional point of view, one is that it is very time-consuming, and the other is that it is difficult for non-professionals to understand. To put it in a popular analogy, it takes a little time in the early stage to sharpen the axe faster. I can chop more wood later.\u201d\u201cThis explanation sounds quite reasonable.\u201d Qu Chengchen glanced down at the draft, \u201cSecond question, the method commonly used in the world to separate single rare earths is still ion exchange, but in your research, the solvent method has completely replaced it. Ion exchange, solvent method is indeed higher than ion exchange in extraction efficiency, but the disadvantages are also obvious. At present, the most effective separation of ultra-high purity single rare earth and heavy rare earth is ion exchange chromatography, which is also the reason for your research. The main reason for the lack of progress in the field of heavy rare earths. Professor Liu is very confident in the breakthrough of heavy rare earths, and has done this research for about three to five years\u2026\u201d Qu Chengchen smiled, his tone was somewhat contemptuous, \u201cVision. I can only use this word to describe it. But the reality is, why do we use the ready-made ion exchange method and spend billions of investment and research funds to study the improvement of the solvent extraction process on heavy rare earths? From a commercial point of view, the input-output ratio is very poor.\u201dScientific research is about investing a huge amount of money in the early stage to bet for a huge return. This is something that every investor understands. Of course, it is also common for investors to spend real money and not see the money back. However, the results of Shen Dai\u2019s group last year were not bad, and it can even be said to be the best among several research groups, but Qu Chengchen didn\u2019t say anything during the first two groups of speeches. So, he can\u2019t help but to feel surprised.Such a question is difficult to answer. It is like a person throwing stones into a well, and throwing a hundred stones trying to fill it up, but when he throws fifty stones, he becomes impatient, and Shen Dai has to convince him to continue throwing the rest in.Although Shen Dai was well prepared, he was also annoyed by Qu Chengchen\u2019s deliberately making things difficult. He glanced at the draft paper. Although it was far away, he couldn\u2019t see anything clearly, but it was full of them. After he answered this, there were more tricky ones. Waiting for himself, at this time, he felt more and more suffocated in his chest, and his body was a little hot. He took a deep breath again, calmed down, and replied without being humble or arrogant: \u201cMr. Qu, ion exchange method is indeed the most mainstream separation method at present. The teacher has seen the ceiling of the ion exchange method. We are very optimistic about the prospect of a solvent extraction method. It is also the most important research direction of our group. Once successful, whether it is light rare earth or heavy rare earth, it can achieve great efficiency improvement, and the return will be amazing.\u201d\u201cBut judging from the performance of the past three years, your progress in the field of heavy rare earths is very limited, and the numbers in the financial report are really \u2018amazing\u2019. Only light rare earths are studied in the solvent extraction process.\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s face darkened, he glanced at Qu Chengchen across a few people, but unfortunately Qu Chengchen couldn\u2019t see it.Shen Dai wiped the sweat from his forehead: \u201cWe\u2026\u201d\u201cChengchen.\u201d Qu Moyu also turned on the switch of the microphone at some point, and the low voice was slightly distorted in the amplifier, accompanied by some noise, but he couldn\u2019t stop the displeasure in his tone, \u201cThis piece of rare earth extraction and the relationship with your chemical department is limited, and even the first group of non-ferrous metals is not as curious as you are.\u201dQu Chengchen said with a smile: \u201cBecause there is nothing wrong with the speeches of the first group, I have no doubts. I am not curious, but feeling responsible to the shareholders.\u201d\u201cI know more about rare earth research than you. Professor Liu has solid theories and data to support her judgement on pre-processing and her investment in solvent methods. Their plans have been professionally evaluated, and every report in the financial report has been backed up. A single expenditure can also stand up to accounting and auditing.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes were bright and dark. Deep and dark, \u201cYou have a low reserve of professional knowledge, so there will inevitably be many things you don\u2019t understand, but you should be aware of the group\u2019s risk control. Be confident in their abilities.\u201d\u201cRisk control is to control risks, which means that risks do exist. I really don\u2019t know much about rare earths, which makes you laugh, but I think what I have raised are reasonable questions. After all, as shareholders holding original shares, they spend every cent on this. I have a share of the money as well.\u201d Qu Chengchen sneered, \u201cIsn\u2019t answering questions the point of an investor meeting?\u201d\u201cYour doubts have been questioned many times by people who are countless times more professional than you in the process of budgeting.\u201dThe two brothers looked at each other slowly with a few people in the middle. Under this provocation, the pheromone of resistance was quietly brewing in their bodies.There was silence in the conference hall. The two brothers of the Qu family have been fighting openly and secretly since childhood. It is not news for a long time, but it is relatively rare for them to be at each other\u2019s throats in public. When they noticed that the two secretly released pheromones, everyone was like a formidable enemy.When two S-class Alphas start fighting for information, the surrounding alphas must also release pheromones to protect themselves.Yan Mingxiu, who happened to be sitting between the two, immediately opened the pheromone barrier to isolate them from their influence on him. Most of those shareholders and executives are alphas, and they are also forced to release pheromones, lest they be spit out by the pheromones of the three S-class Alphas.Yan Mingxiu stood up with a gloomy face and walked outside of the conference hall.For a time, the concentration of alpha pheromones in the conference hall increased rapidly. Shen Dai only felt like an invisible hand was strangling his throat, and his whole body stinged like an electric shock, and the blood on his face faded. He grabbed the lecture table and began to tremble.Qu Moyu was the first to notice Shen Dai\u2019s strangeness, and he immediately withdrew the pheromone.Qu Chengchen also went down the steps, and he made an apologetic look: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it affected Shen Gong.\u201d\u201cShen Gong turned out to be an omega?\u201d a shareholder said in surprise, \u201cI really can\u2019t tell.\u201d\u201cThere are still omegas in the research institute?\u201dThere was a lot of discussion in the audience.Shen Dai strongly bowed: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He walked off the podium with his weak legs, ran out the side door, and went straight to the bathroom.It\u2019s over, something\u2019s wrong, the body\u2019s reaction\u2026 he thought.A tall and strong bodyguard-like man stood at the door of the bathroom, stopped Shen Dai: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, please wait a moment.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t wait!\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s face was terrifyingly pale.The bodyguard looked at him as if he was about to faint at any time, and hesitated for a moment: \u201cWould you like me to call someone for you\u2026\u201dShen Dai pushed away the bodyguard and rushed into the bathroom, then bumped into a tall figure walking out, who grabbed his arm.Shen Dai looked up and saw that it was Yan Mingxiu. His legs were so weak that he could barely stand, and he fell straight down.Yan Mingxiu frowned: \u201cAren\u2019t you going to be in heat?\u201d\u201cPlease\u2026 help me.\u201d Shen Dai was so anxious that he wanted to hit the wall. Why did he always encounter this embarrassing situation? Three years ago in the laboratory, this time in the office building, he could have delayed it by taking the medicine. It had been a few days, but just now, his body had been hit by a large amount of alpha pheromones, and it had completely become disordered, and he fought back in place during the estrus period.\u201cI won\u2019t help you, I have a wife.\u201d Yan Mingxiu said helplessly, \u201cMy bodyguard will guard the door, and I will call the security department to deal with it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d Shen Dai trembled, \u201cCall Qu Moyu for me, please.\u201dOnly Qu Moyu can save him, this is his deep-rooted belief.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQu Moyu rushed to the bathroom and found Shen Dai in the last compartment.He was curled up beside the toilet, his arms were cradling his body, shivering, and a thin layer of powder appeared on his fair neck, like a puppy abandoned in winter.The fragrance of epiphyllum pheromones is full in the surroundings. Although it is still relatively light, it is almost impossible not to smell it at this distance. The pheromone during the estrus period is pervasively invading the senses near Alphas.Qu Moyu frowned and squatted down: \u201cShen Dai.\u201dWhen Shen Dai heard the movement, his body shrank obviously, and he didn\u2019t dare to look back: \u201cMy inhibitor is in my computer bag.\u201d\u201cI brought it.\u201d Qu Moyu handed him the computer bag.Only then did Shen Dai slowly turn around, fearing that he would bump into Qu Moyu, he quickly grabbed the computer bag, took out two potions from it, unscrewed them, and drank them.\u201cYou took two?\u201d\u201cIf possible\u2026 I should take three.\u201d Of course Shen Dai knew that taking too much inhibitor would hurt the body, and the inhibitor itself would hurt the body, but his estrus was more violent compared to others.Qu Moyu looked at Shen Dai\u2019s sweaty face, his cheeks were flushed, his eyes were dazzled, and his eyelashes were trembling rapidly, like a frightened butterfly flapping in a rainstorm.The inhibitor doesn\u2019t take effect quickly, and it is usually taken in advance. The body\u2019s heat can\u2019t be relieved for a while. Shen Dai lowered his head and dared not look into Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes: \u201cMr. Qu, I\u2019m sorry for causing you trouble again, I\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026\u201d He was full of annoyance and suffocation, and his voice choked as he spoke. Why did he, an adult, fall into such an unbearable situation time and time again? He carefully observed the reaction of his body. He carried the inhibitor against his body all year round. After 20 years of hard work, he achieved his hard-won career today. These stupid things ruined\u2026Qu Moyu said softly, \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d In the accident three years ago, it was finally investigated that a competitor drugged him, and that person had been expelled and deprived of his student status. This time, Shen Dai was obviously punished by a large amount of Alpha pheromone influence, so he became like this.\u201cCan you take me away?\u201d Shen Dai whispered.\u201cOkay.\u201d Qu Moyu took off his windbreaker, wrapped it around Shen Dai, and picked him up again.Shen Dai\u2019s body was originally too soft to use strength, but at this time it suddenly became stiff, and the alpha pheromone belonging to Qu Moyu penetrated into his senses forcefully. For him, at this moment, it was like adding gasoline to the fire.He was sensible at this time, and didn\u2019t dare to move, for fear that he would do something bold.Yan Mingxiu was still waiting outside. He smelled Shen Dai\u2019s pheromone and took a step back: \u201cAre you okay?\u201dEven if Shen Dai is not fully in heat yet, the pheromone released is already unstoppable by ordinary alphas, but each S-class Alpha has a very strong self-control, and the two of them can remain calm.\u201cHe had taken his inhibitor, it\u2019s better to leave as soon as possible. Mr. Yan, use your bodyguard to escort us to the elevator entrance.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThe moment he left the bathroom, Shen Dai buried his face in Qu Moyu\u2019s chest. In fact, most of the people were still in the conference hall at this time, and there were only a few scattered people in the corridor. The worst scene he imagined of being surrounded by many people did not appear.But the culprit that caused his accident appeared, and he heard Qu Chengchen\u2019s voice approaching with footsteps: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is Shen Gong okay?\u201dQu Moyu glanced at him coldly, then turned and left.\u201cIsn\u2019t he in heat?\u201d Qu Chengchen followed. He couldn\u2019t help laughing, and then he covered it up with a light cough, \u201cOh, it\u2019s our fault, Gong Shen, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201dShen Dai was so angry that his teeth were itching, but he couldn\u2019t attack. His hand tightened on Qu Moyu\u2019s clothes, and he just wanted to leave quickly and hide in a place where there was no one, a place that would give him a sense of security.\u201cBrother, where are you taking him? He needs professional help now. He can call an emergency\u2026\u201dQu Moyu stopped suddenly, he stared at Qu Chengchen, his eyes sharp and gloomy.Qu Chengchen smiled and said: \u201cBig brother is angry, you must calm down. If you can\u2019t help releasing pheromones, he can\u2019t stand it.\u201dQu Moyu only spit out a word: \u201cGo away.\u201d He turned around and walked quickly towards the elevator.The internal elevator went straight to the underground parking lot. At this time, the driver was not there. Qu Moyu unlocked the car from the app on his mobile phone, put Shen Dai in first, then closed the door and called Lao Wu to come down.Shen Dai wrapped himself around Qu Moyu\u2019s windbreaker and curled up on the car seat, wishing he could wrap himself up without a gap, he tried his best to lean in the direction of the car door, trying in vain to get further away from Qu Moyu.Why is the inhibitor still not working? Why is his mouth still dry and his tongue is dry? Why is his mind getting more and more dizzy? his body is getting hotter and stronger, and his impulse is getting stronger and stronger, should he take another inhibitor?In less than five minutes, Lao Wu came down in a hurry. He glanced at Shen Dai through the car window: \u201cMaster, what\u2019s wrong with Mr. Shen?\u201dQu Moyu gave him a look, motioning him not to ask.Lao Wu immediately understood, and the two got into the car together.As soon as the car door was closed, the fragrance of ephemera instantly filled the confined and narrow compartment. Qu Moyu glanced at Shen Dai who was hiding under the windbreaker, and his eyes became deep and heavy. He loosened his tie with his hand and lowered the car window. When the cold air from the outside of the car came in and blew away the elusive floral fragrance, he dared to breathe at a normal frequency.\u201cHow long will it take to get home?\u201d\u201cIn forty minutes.\u201d\u201cASAP.\u201d\u201cI want to go home.\u201d Shen Dai trembled.\u201cWe\u2019re going home.\u201d\u201cNot your home. I want to go back to my home\u2026\u201d Shen Dai insisted on his sanity and gave an address. When he gets home, his grandmother will take care of him, and he can spend the most difficult days in a small house \u2013 what he desires most at this time is a safe cave rather than relieving his libido.Lao Wu entered the address in the navigation: \u201cThis place is quite far, and there is still a traffic jam out of the city, it will take more than an hour.\u201dQu Moyu ordered: \u201cGo home.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShen Dai whimpered softly, his body twisted uncomfortably under the windbreaker, he tugged at the fabric of his body, and he rubbed his legs, but he couldn\u2019t relieve the increasingly terrifying heat, and he felt a pain somewhere.Qu Moyu found that it was no longer possible to open the car window. The smell of epiphyllum pheromones became stronger and stronger. If this continued, it was likely to affect pedestrians, so he had to close the car window.Although Lao Wu was a beta, he could guess what was going on. He took a peek in the rearview mirror and quickly looked back.Shen Dai felt that he couldn\u2019t take it anymore. The state at the moment magnified his senses. Even if he was covering his nose, the pheromone of ebony was still pervasive, and the smell of S-class Alpha was so exuberant, so wild, so domineering, full of the power of the most powerful male. It evokes all his primitive impulses, making him want to do whatever is necessary to complete the reproductive task driven by genetic instinct.He rolled off the saddle, curled up in a foetal position on the footpads in pain.He knew that he might not be able to get home, so he lost his mind first. This time he was affected by dozens of alpha pheromones after taking the drug that delayed the estrus period, resulting in an endocrine disorder. He is afraid that it is comparable to the time when he was drugged three years ago. Two oral inhibitors are useless, and three would also be useless. He has to use stronger drugs. He said dumbly: \u201cGo\u2026 go to the hospital, or the pharmacy, I want a stronger inhibitor.\u201dStronger inhibitors will be injected directly into the glands, which are very damaging to the body, but can suppress estrus in the fastest time. This powerful inhibitor is a prescription drug, and the pharmacy must have a doctor\u2019s order to sell it. However, in an emergency, it can be used first and then filed. Now, it is an emergency.The fragrance of the ephemera impacted the senses. Qu Moyu forced himself to look out the window, but now he couldn\u2019t help but turn his head and glanced at the person beside his feet. Tears streaked, his hair was messy against his skin, his neckline was torn open by himself, revealing a large expanse of exquisite collarbone, and the pain he endured also brewed the ultimate temptation.When he looked at him, he could no longer look away.Lao Wu asked Qu Moyu with his eyes in the rearview mirror if he wanted to go to the hospital or pharmacy.Qu Moyu shook his head, a car worth tens of millions, plus an omega in heat, any passerby with a mobile phone might gossip the next day, and his uncle was aiming to see his faults all day long. Waiting for him to make a mistake, this matter will definitely be a big fuss, and even affect the stock price, he will not take that kind of risk.Qu Moyu leaned down, stretched out his hand slowly, wiped away the tears from Shen Dai\u2019s face, pinched his chin lightly, and stared at him blankly.\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d Shen Dai begged vaguely, but he didn\u2019t know what he was begging for. Whether he was begging him to send him to the hospital, or begging him to come to relieve his pain immediately. Now. Right away.Qu Moyu pressed the button with one hand, and the transparent partition of the rear seat slowly turned into a fog surface, blocking the driver\u2019s sight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 17": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQu Moyu picked Shen Dai up from his feet, and made him sit on his lap. Seeing the tears that kept oozing out of Shen Dai\u2019s eyes, he wiped it with his fingertips: \u201cYou don\u2019t usually like to cry.\u201dShen Dai looked at Qu Moyu blankly and sluggishly, for a while, he couldn\u2019t tell whether the picture of him being held in Qu Moyu\u2019s arms was a mere extreme fantasy. He felt uncomfortable. Qu Moyu\u2019s hand first stroked his slightly damp hair, and then slid down the back of his neck. The big hand easily held his entire neck, and the hottest part of the palm was attached to the hot glands \u2013 separated by a layer of a pheromone barrier sticker which should already be dispensable. Qu Moyu\u2019s breathing became heavy.Surrounded by the dry and cold pheromones of ebony wood, an electric current ran through Shen Dai\u2019s scalp, and his body trembled more and more intolerably. The sense of security guarded by the Beastmaster, the animal instinct will dominate the brain during estrus, and all his rationality and sensibility are telling him loudly that he wants this person to mate with him regardless of everything else.His last trace of reason collapsed, he hugged Qu Moyu\u2019s neck tightly, pressing his hot lips against it, clumsily and eagerly trying to have all intimate connections with this person. Qu Moyu paused for a while, then turned back to the guest and kissed the pair of wet lips with more strength. His breath, the tip of his tongue, and his will were all invaded by the strong fragrance of the epiphyllum, and the body fluid he tasted was sweet and intoxicating like a fine wine, and he couldn\u2019t help but want to squeeze more sweetness from the person in his arms.They kissed each other rudely and passionately. Each other\u2019s breaths are exchanged. It was like poison spreading rapidly, paralysing every nerve, any reason is vulnerable to such aphrodisiac poison. \u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Shen Dai hung weakly on Qu Moyu\u2019s body, buried his face in the crevice of his neck, used his nose to open his loose shirt, and deliberately bumped against the thick and broad chest, trying desperately to sniff. He is rubbing, licking and kissing. Greedily absorbing the powerful alpha pheromone, even the temperature of the skin must be incorporated into his own circulatory system and he wanted to keep monopolising. Shen Dai\u2019s genitals were fondled by Qu Moyu, and the manic desires in his body suddenly took on a rushing direction. A sticky moan kept coming out of his throat. He felt his buttocks being pressed against something hard and hot. Instinctively twisting his butt, dawdling through his pants, that was the kind of fire that could ignite his desire, and he desperately wanted to have it.Shen Dai was rubbing and twisting in Qu Moyu\u2019s arms impatiently. His naked sensuality almost dominated his brain. The pheromones blended together, regardless of each other. When he was kissed by Qu Moyu, his lips were sore and his brain was deprived of oxygen.Qu Moyu took off his suit jacket, loosened his tie, and released a soothing pheromone. He rubbed Shen Dai\u2019s bulging crotch with his hands through his pants, and opened the zipper in Shen Dai\u2019s low panting. His fingers got in, he knew that the omega in his arms couldn\u2019t take it anymore and needed a quick relief.Qu Moyu took a deep breath. He hugged Shen Dai\u2019s waist, took a punitive bite on the tender collarbone, and said in a low voice, \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d\u201cI-I want to\u2026\u201d\u201cI know you want it. Endure.\u201d Qu Moyu rubbed his lower lip with his teeth, then took a bite, regaining a brief sobriety in the severe pain. He has been trained to resist omega pheromones very harshly. The reason why every S-class Alpha undergoes this inhumane training is to not get out of control by the temptation of an omega. If they can easily surrender to a person, it is like letting themselves be slaughtered, and it is not worthy of being called an S-class Alpha.However, that doesn\u2019t mean that he has to suppress his desires. When this omega was brought to his mouth again and again, let\u2019s just eat it. When he finally got home, Lao Wu drove the car into the underground garage, and Qu Moyu wrapped the disheveled Shen Dai with the windbreaker covered with erotic pheromones and carried him directly into the elevator. For a short period of time, Shen Dai continued to rub Qu Moyu with his face dishonestly. He was affectionate, pleasing, and desperate for \u2018food\u2019. He was completely different from the usual calm, polite, and distant researcher. Just like his pheromone, how light it is at ordinary times, but how strong it is when he is in heat. The elevator went straight up to the second floor. Qu Moyu carried Shen Dai into the guest room, threw him on the big bed, and pressed Shen Dai under him with his tall body and kissed him roughly. Piece by piece, he stripped off the excessive clothing, dragged the fair body out of the cumbersome fabric, and displayed it in his eyes without reservation. Shen Dai is indeed not as thin and small as an ordinary omega. His body is slender, smooth and powerful. A layer of flexible muscles wraps his bones thinly, they are neither shrivelled nor loose. There is no violation, this is just right. It is like a middle version. The grown omega is too soft. And the alpha is too strong. So this first-blooming and fleeting beauty is unforgettable. Qu Moyu kissed Shen Dai\u2019s tear-wet cheek, opened his mouth to bite his already red and swollen lips, swallowed his low voice into his belly, stroked the warm texture all the way with his big hand, got into his legs, and touched the part of the body with sticky hands.Since he was an adult, the closest thing he was to losing control was when he rescued an omega in heat at the Rare Earth Research Institute three years ago. He had to use a temporary marker to appease the other party, otherwise he might also lose his mind. If he was not in public at that time, or not even in the company, he would already do whatever he wants. It is desire that drives people to climb the peak of power, and the purpose of reaching the peak is precisely to satisfy desire, and restraint is for better indulgence.He sniffed the scent of the ephemeral flowers that entangled him, stroked the trembling and dependent body in his arms, and his mind was full of unsatisfied desires at the time. It\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t think of the researcher who hugged him and cried and begged, and he was also impulsive to the sweetness, but he would not cause unnecessary trouble for a highly replaceable bed partner, even three years later because of coincidental reasons, this person was sent to him again, and he did not intend to complicate this cooperation for a momentary pleasure.Shen Dai instinctively clamped his legs, but Qu Moyu pushed his knees away with his elbows and whispered in his ear, \u201cIt\u2019s so wet.\u201d While speaking, his slender fingers had already got into the wet cave. The cave, the intestinal fluid secreted by an omega when it is in heat, proves that the body is fully prepared to accept being fucked.Shen Dai was pressed by Qu Moyu and couldn\u2019t move. The invasion of a foreign body he had never experienced made his hot brain instinctively resist. He grabbed Qu Moyu\u2019s shirt, not knowing whether he wanted to push him away or to hold him closer. When Qu Moyu\u2019s fingers poked back and forth in his flesh, making him tremble, he couldn\u2019t help biting the other\u2019s shoulder.Qu Moyu lowered his head and bit the tip of Shen Dai\u2019s nose, and whispered, \u201cHey, you smell good.\u201d His lower abdomen was already full of pain. When he took off his trousers, his erected cock was ready to go. He was poking at the already soft and squishy hole, but he didn\u2019t go in.Shen Dai\u2019s desire was overwhelming . As if attacked, he tore off Qu Moyu\u2019s shirt , he was fascinated by Qu Moyu\u2019s strong and powerful body and clinging tightly, he was surrounded by strong alpha pheromones, as if this was the safest in the world. The lair allows him to unleash his nature to the fullest, he begged vaguely, wanting to be conquered by the most powerful alpha in his mind.Qu Moyu\u2019s endurance has also reached the brink of collapse, the thick and long genitals are congested to purple colour, the tendons were bulging, and he just wanted to smash it into the hot zone and do whatever he wanted, but he still endured it with tenacious self-control, he took Shen Dai\u2019s hand, guided it to hold the meat blade, and whispered in Shen Dai\u2019s ears. In his exclamation, he rubbed his warm palm until he heard a knock on the door.When Shen Dai realised his intention to get up, he was instantly overwhelmed by fear, and he hugged Qu Moyu with his hands and feet and said with a cry: \u201cNo, don\u2019t go, please don\u2019t go.\u201d\u201cBe good, I\u2019m not going.\u201d Qu Moyu kissed the corners of his slightly wet eyes and wanted to get out of bed to open the door, but Shen Dai was so frightened that he hugged him tightly with a strength that surprised him, and he couldn\u2019t get rid of him for a while, so he had to carry Shen Dai with him. He hugged him, put his legs around his waist, and hung him on his body as he walked towards the door. Uncle Heng, who had been prepared, stood at the door with his back to the door, handing over the things that Qu Moyu needed. As a beta, he couldn\u2019t smell the pheromone, but the smell of lust was strong enough. He coughed lightly to hide his embarrassment.Qu Moyu took the condom and quickly slammed the door.Shen Dai\u2019s brain was already muddled and couldn\u2019t think, and he didn\u2019t know what these actions of Qu Moyu represent. The only thing he cares about is that he cannot be separated from this person. Qu Moyu pressed Shen Dai on the bed again, pushed his slender thighs apart with his knees, and pressed his erected genitals against the slightly opened acupoint, he stood up and pushed in.Shen Dai suddenly twitched violently, his face full of spring waves distorted instantly, he shouted the word \u201cpain\u201d, and then bit his lip.Qu Moyu also felt the tightness inside even when it was obviously already so excessively wet.Now, he squeezed Shen Dai\u2019s chin and gently pried open the small front teeth: \u201cRelax, haven\u2019t you ever done it yet?\u201dShen Dai shook his head in pain, he grabbed Qu Moyu\u2019s steel-hard arm, gasping for breath, getting angry. The secret passage that had never been opened up suddenly felt like a fire stick had been inserted into it. It was thick, hard, and hot, but this pain not only could not extinguish his own fire of lust, on the contrary, the less he felt, the more intense his pain was. Driven by the alpha pheromone, the body crazily longs to be impacted forcefully.Qu Moyu bowed his head and kissed his cheek, coaxing softly: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, relax, the tension will make it more uncomfortable.\u201d He never touches an inexperienced bed partner, and when it comes to meeting his physiological needs, he has always been swayed. For those who served him, he won\u2019t waste time to get high enjoyment at a low cost, but at this moment, he is showing patience and gentleness that he didn\u2019t even notice himself. He lifted Shen Dai\u2019s buttocks easily with one hand, dragged the pillow under his waist, widened Shen Dai\u2019s legs, pulled out his genitals shallowly, and pushed in firmly again, he could feel himself in the suffocating heat. Opening up\u00a0 the corridor of the meat walls inch by inch, the feeling of being tightly wrapped and rubbed was so refreshing. The more Shen Dai trembled and wept, the more he could feel the joy of conquering. The hand on the chest is now pressed against the bed, the waist was straight, and the whole cock was stabbed into it.Shen Dai let out a moan with a crying voice, and there was a wave in the pain. It was a splash of water in the oil pan, which completely boiled him. The pleasure hit so violently that it overwhelmed his remaining consciousness. He instinctively squeezed his gut, he wanted to keep what was inside him, to fit tightly with himself, never to separate again.Qu Moyu held his leg with one hand and rubbed his buttocks with the other. After pulling out the meat blade, he pushed it deeply again, and then began to pump it in and out violently. Being able to touch Shen Dai\u2019s genital cavity, the cunning animal instinct is tempting him to open the genital cavity to sow his seeds into it and perform the reproduction task engraved in his genes. His thigh pinched the red mark, and he slammed the round buttocks into a slap.Shen Dai was being fucked so loudly that he couldn\u2019t stop screaming. It was a sound he wouldn\u2019t believe he could make when he was sober. It was sweet, slutty, and emotional. The hot meat blade was always fast and powerful thrusting in and out of his body.\u00a0 It brought boundless stimulation, and the body felt numb as a result of being overcharged. From the scalp to the toes, every nerve and every cell was clamouring for extreme pleasure, and his front end of the genitals sprayed out a turbid white liquid.Qu Moyu took out his wet genitals, held Shen Dai\u2019s ankles and turned his body over, pressed his neck and forced him to lift his butt, knelt down in front of him, and inserted it roughly from behind.\u201cAh ah ah\u2013\u201d The body that had just ejaculated was extremely sensitive, any stimulation made Shen Dai feel the tingling like an ant bite, and he could really feel Qu Moyu\u2019s big meat stick running through his body. When he lowered his head, he could see that hideous and terrifying thing drilling in and out of his asshole. When he got to the deepest point, he could even see a slightly convex column from his flat abdomen. He was tormented by the overwhelming pleasure. He keeps yelling, but his alpha is far from satisfied.Shen Dai buried his face in the quilt, screamed and cried, his upper body was almost bent into an incredible arc, showing his flesh hole to his alpha to the greatest extent possible, he begged, \u201cwoo woo\u2026bite me. I beg you. Bite me, please\u2026\u201d He wants to be marked, he wants to be marked like crazy. An omega in heat longs to be marked by his alpha like a desert island survivor longs for food and water.Qu Moyu looked down at Shen Dai condescendingly, with his narrow waistline, butterfly-like shoulder blades, and slightly red and swollen glands, he couldn\u2019t help grinding his sharp canine teeth, leaned down, and the tip of his nose hovered above the glands, smelled them fiercely, the intoxicating, floral fragrance penetrated his senses pervasively, it was hard to imagine an omega whose pheromone scent was so light at ordinary times, why the pheromone in estrus would be so strong and violent? If even he was on the edge of being bewitched, which alpha can resist it like this? Thinking that Shen Dai could easily tempt other alpha and attract wolves, he suddenly felt anger and jealousy, he opened his mouth, his canine teeth hovered on the back of the white and tender neck, greedy saliva hung from his mouth. The glandular glands hung down from his mouth. The body was giving off a sweet smell, seducing him to bite down, biting down hard!Mark his prey and possess it forever! Reason was pulling him to the limit. Qu Moyu bit his lip again with his canine teeth, and woke up his drowsy brain with pain. No, it was sobering. He sobered up and found that he had been bewitched so far, and he really gave birth to the idea of marking him!The astonishment turned into anger. Qu Moyu couldn\u2019t believe that an ordinary omega could shake his self-control like this. His bloodshot eyes were stained with anger. He pinched the back of Shen Dai\u2019s neck again and covered the glands that keep exuding the scent of ecstasy with his hands. He then madly thrust into the ecstasy honey pussy. Each blow is getting rougher and rougher, completely ignoring the tender genital cavity, and slams the belt wide open. Giving him the thrill of a mad wolf, his waist and hips swayed tirelessly, and he knew that as long as he slammed into this tight, soft, wet and hot secret passage, he would get an endless supply of excitement.\u201cAhhh Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s body couldn\u2019t even keep up to the inertia. He moved forward to buffer the attack behind him and he abruptly worked hard to endure every time. He could only respond with continuous moaning and begging. Pain and pleasure are in sync, destroying all his will and making him a slave of carnal desire. In a chaotic subconscious, he knew that it was his begging for a mark that angered his alpha, and in a chaotic consciousness, he knew that this person was not his alpha, not his. Tears soaked the quilt, and even at this moment when he was being fucked to madness, he still felt unspeakable sadness.Shen Dai\u2019s heart is sinking, but his body keeps climbing to the peak. His back pussy surged, and with every hit brought a lewd sound of water, he was once again shot out by Qu Moyu. His body was soft and rotten after being fucked, his long legs kept shaking, and he couldn\u2019t even kneel. He had to rely on Qu Moyu to hold his waist so that he wouldn\u2019t fall on the bed. And Qu Moyu changed his position to lie on his side, hugged him tightly, and started a new round of fucking.The physical strength of an S-class alpha is beyond the imagination of ordinary people. Qu Moyu only ejaculated once after he had made Shen Dai ejaculated three times. And this is just the beginning of his estrus period.Sperm-filled condoms were thrown in expensive wool rugs. It is not normal garbage. S-class Alpha sperm are fetching millions to tens of millions on the black market. Even if they don\u2019t necessarily produce the same superior offspring, the odds are the best, and, once you get the chance to get a paternity test, it\u2019s possible to split big bills and make a class jump. Therefore, they have always been strictly guarded, for fear that someone will have bad intentions.Qu Moyu hugged Shen Dai in his arms, their sweaty bodies fit each other tightly, his heart beating next to his heart, but they were not beating at the same frequency.Only after the urge is relieved that the omega in estrus will get a brief sobriety until the next spring tide strikes, but Shen Dai would rather not be so sober. He doesn\u2019t know how to face Qu Moyu or face his own current situation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 18": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySeven days would usually be given to omegas as an estrus holiday in the workplace. Although Shen Dai always ends his estrus early, he will go back to work when he has enough rest. At this time, he could no longer stay in this room filled with the smell of pheromones that had not yet dissipated. After washing and changing clothes, he planned to go home.When he reached downstairs, he still inevitably ran into Uncle Heng.Uncle Heng is worthy of being a professional housekeeper. He is well-balanced. His face is calm, and he asks in a natural and appropriate tone: \u201cAre you going out? Your health hasn\u2019t recovered yet.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright, I\u2019ll go home.\u201d Shen Dai also tried his best to pretend to be calm, but his steps were weak.\u201cI\u2019ll let the driver take you. You are at your weakest now.\u201d Uncle Heng added, \u201cAnd it\u2019s not easy to take a taxi from here.\u201dThe end of the estrus period is indeed the time for omega\u2019s lowest physical fitness. This is because they rarely ate and did high-intensity \u2018exercise\u2019 these days. After the hormones recede, the fatigue will reach its peak. Shen Dai, while standing like this, his legs already feel sore and weak. No, it is actually really unwise to go out at this time, but he is trying to run away.Shen Dai still pushed back and said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, I have already called for a car.\u201d\u201cLet the driver escort you. I heard from Xiao Wu that you live far away. If the young master finds out, he will blame me for not taking good care of you.\u201dAs soon as Qu Moyu was mentioned, Shen Dai involuntarily wanted to obey. Obedience to an alpha is also an omega\u2019s pathetic nature: \u201cOkay, thank you.\u201dShen Dai got into the MPV, and another driver of Qu Moyu took him home. After the car drove all the way out of Qu\u2019s house, Shen Dai\u2019s heart, which felt like a hand was gripping on it, relaxed a little. And the alpha pheromone belonging to Qu Moyu lingering around his body seemed to have finally dissipated. He should be thankful that Qu Moyu didn\u2019t even give him a temporary mark during those three days. Although more than three years had passed, he could still recall the unprecedented loss when the temporary mark disappeared.He took out his mobile phone and clicked to look at Qu Moyu\u2019s WeChat. There was only one system verification message in the dialog box. The circle of friends was still empty. He could only stare at the silent avatar in a daze. When he came downstairs today, he was afraid to see Qu Moyu, but he was also eager to see Qu Moyu. He was eager to know how they would get along when they met again, but it was entirely up to Qu Moyu.It really sucks to feel like someone else is in control of everything.Shen Dai was so tired that he fell asleep in the car. When he got home, it was already dark.Grandma was very worried when she saw that his face was pale and he looked weak: \u201cAh Dai, are you sick? Why did you lose weight after not seeing you for a few days? And your face looks so bad.\u201d\u201cAs I told you last time, I\u2019m preparing for a speech during this time, so I work a lot of overtime. It\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll just rest for a few days.\u201d Shen Dai collapsed on the sofa, feeling like he would fall asleep again soon.Grandma sighed softly, stroked his hair, and said lovingly, \u201cMy baby is tired and thin. Have you eaten yet? Are you hungry?\u201dShen Dai smiled and said coquettishly, \u201cCan grandma cook me a bowl of noodles? With the eggs fried?\u201d\u201cOkay, you rest first. You\u2019re here just in time to taste the beef tendon I just marinated yesterday.\u201dShen Dai stretched his sore muscles on the sofa, and looked at the ceiling above his head with tired eyes. This small apartment was shabby compared to Qu\u2019s house, but he rented it with money that belonged to him. He can live here with his most favourite person in this world. But in a high-end villa where food and clothing are all taken care of, he is not qualified to even step into his nominal husband\u2019s room, and even sex is only done in the guest room. His status is worse than a guest\u2026The next moment, Shen Dai shouted \u2018Stop\u2019 to himself in his heart. He needs to stop these self-pity thoughts, and stop these useless entanglements. If a person can\u2019t stop his mental internal friction, he will have more problems because he can\u2019t take care of his own troubles in life. His sanity is ringing alarm bells for him.Once his muddled head has cooled down, it is time to return to reason.After a day\u2019s rest, Shen Dai made an appointment with the real estate agent. The agent found a few more houses according to his needs and showed them to him one by one. He screened out two houses and negotiated the price with the agent. As long as it meets the reserve price in his heart, he wants to buy and move in as soon as possible. In this way, it will take another month or two to simply do some repairs and buy some furnishings, and then he will be able to bring his grandmother to live in a new house before the New Year.Every time he looked at the balance in his bank account, he reminded himself to treat Qu Moyu as his boss, thank him more and have less expectations. In fact, when he first promised You Xinghai to marry as a substitute to You Baiyue, he was ready to sell himself. Being able to sell himself to Qu Moyu was obviously a huge bargain, and he was also very happy. He enlightened himself with this idea all on his own, the effect is remarkable.The intermediary is very efficient. On the last day of his vacation, he and the owner reached a mutually satisfactory price, and the next step is to go through the process.Shen Dai felt a big stone had been taken out from his heart, and was very pleased to be able to provide a new and comfortable environment for his grandmother.On the first day back to work, his colleagues expressed their concern for him one after another. They all knew that he was affected by alpha pheromones on the podium at the time, and that he was not feeling well. So he asked for a few days off, but they didn\u2019t know how uncomfortable he was and also how he was \u2018comforted\u2019.But the purpose of this group of people is obviously more than just being concerned. A bold junior sister asked: \u201cSenior Brother Shen, I heard that after the speech that day, you fainted in the toilet. Is it Mr. Qu who sent you to the hospital?\u201d\u201cHow come I heard that it was Yan Mingxiu?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s President Yan\u2019s bodyguard.\u201d Shen Dai said calmly, \u201cActually, I didn\u2019t faint, I was just uncomfortable. It was not because of the influence of pheromones, but because I stayed up too late a lot that time, so I took a few days off along the way.\u201dThe gossip that has been spreading in the past few days has ended in an understatement here, and everyone can\u2019t help but disperse in disappointment.But Cheng Zimei was not so easily fooled. She grabbed Shen Dai and asked reluctantly, \u201cTell me the truth, are you really helped by a bodyguard? Some people said that they saw the crown prince helping you with their own eyes.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s really not like that. Alphas and omegas have to keep a proper distance in public, how could Mr. Qu be so careless? It\u2019s really Yan Mingxiu\u2019s beta bodyguard who helped me.\u201d Shen Dai grabbed her and walked to the conference room, \u201cI want us to have a meeting with the teacher in the morning. There\u2019s something serious to discuss.\u201dCheng Zimei had a \u2018it\u2019s such a shame\u2019 expression on her face.Shen Dai and Cheng Zimei held a video conference with the teacher all morning. The teacher highly praised his speech, saying that the feedback from the leadership was also very good, so he should not care about Qu Chengchen\u2019s deliberately making things difficult for him. It has nothing to do with him and there will be no impact on their projects.Shen Dai was relieved a lot, and he didn\u2019t waste his time tossing around for nothing.During the lunch break, he and Cheng Zimei were too lazy to go to the cafeteria, so they asked the younger brothers and sisters to bring them meals.When Zhou Lan came back, he not only brought rice, but also a cup of stewed pear, which is the sign of a well-known delicacy of a dessert shop near the company and is very popular during winter.\u201cSenior brother, this is the rice bowl you want, senior sister, this is your ramen.\u201d Zhou Lan put the bag from the dessert shop on the table and said with a smile, \u201cI bought two cups of stewed pear. If you eat this, it will help to hydrate your body during winter. It\u2019s good for your lungs. I heard that this restaurant is quite famous.\u201dCheng Zimei said with a smile, \u201cThank you, there\u2019s a long line for this one. Every time I want to buy it, I\u2019m persuaded to quit when I see the long line.\u201d\u201cFortunately, it didn\u2019t take too long this time.\u201d Zhou Lan peeked at Shen Dai, \u201cSenior Brother Shen, you\u2019ve lost weight these days, make up more with these.\u201dShen Dai nodded: \u201cThank you, how much is it? I\u2019ll transfer to you altogether.\u201d\u201cAh, no need. Senior brother and senior sister often invite us to dinner anyway.\u201d\u201cYour internship salary is low, don\u2019t be polite to me.\u201d Shen Dai smiled lightly, \u201cbut you don\u2019t have to buy it next time, I rarely eat sweet stuffs.\u201dZhou Lan smiled and concealed the loss in his eyes: \u201cOkay, then you two eat first.\u201dAfter Zhou Lan left, Cheng Zimei ate the sweet. The steaming cup of stewed pear is delicious. She deliberately snorted a few times: \u201cWell, it\u2019s delicious, there\u2019s bird\u2019s nest in it, people will line up to buy it for you during winter. Why don\u2019t you try it now?\u201d\u201cCan you just eat first? Do you still have a stomach to eat anything else after eating this?\u201dAs soon as Shen Dai opened the lunch box, he was forcibly fed a mouthful of sweet pear by Cheng Zimei.\u201cWell, it\u2019s delicious. It\u2019s not too sweet.\u201d Shen Dai said, \u201cBut it\u2019s a bit exaggerated to have to queue up.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not an exaggeration, it\u2019s been very popular online recently.\u201d Cheng Zimei glanced at Zhou Lan in the distance, \u201cThis little junior brother has been staring at you as soon as he entered the research institute. He has good taste.\u201dShen Dai said helplessly: \u201cIf you have time, help me to hint at him. I don\u2019t know how to deal with him. I\u2019m afraid if it will hurt his self-esteem.\u201d\u201cWhat are you having to deal with? I think he\u2019s pretty good. He\u2019s tall and looks good, and his grades are good. The alpha of science and technology is a bit dull, but he\u2019s quite simple and cute.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not interested. He\u2019s also few years younger.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? Nobody cares about that.\u201d\u201cI owe so much money, I can\u2019t fall in love. It will only bother others.\u201dCheng Zimei sighed: \u201cAh Dai, I really want to persuade you to find love. First of all, it\u2019s not you who owes money, it\u2019s your grandma, or more precisely your father, and secondly, even if you have a burden, you have to live your life. It is also to pursuit happiness, in case someone is willing to fight with you. You have avoided so many people who have a good impression of you because of this mess in the past few years, you can\u2019t keep going like this. \u201c\u201cNo one will be willing to go through this with me, even if there is, I don\u2019t want to drag others down.\u201d Shen Dai looked at Cheng Zimei seriously, \u201cWho would want to fall in love and marry someone who owes millions? Zimei, I know you are thinking of what\u2019s good for me, but you also know in your own heart that it is impossible.\u201d\u201cRich people is possible.\u201d Cheng Zimei said in a low voice, \u201cI tell you, I have inquired, Zhou Lan\u2019s family is very good. You only need to find a rich one and all problems are solved.\u201dShen Dai couldn\u2019t help but echoed her in his heart, he did \u2018find\u2019 the rich one and solved the money problem, but also created a lot of new problems: \u201cDon\u2019t make trouble. You help me. Hint him to stop wasting his time. We are all working in the same laboratory, it\u2019s embarrassing that I have nowhere to hide.\u201dCheng Zimei pouted and ate the cup of stewed pear angrily: \u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for you\u00a0 I promise I\u2019ll help you next time.\u201dShen Dai was packing up and was about to get off work when he received a call from an unfamiliar number.\u201cHello.\u201d\u201cMr. Shen, I\u2019m Lao Wu. Are you still in the company or have you gone home?\u201d\u201cI just got off work and I\u2019m about to go home.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s good. The young master asked you to go down to the basement parking so that you can go home together.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Okay.\u201dThese days after the end of his estrus period, he and Qu Moyu have not met or communicated. From the extremely warm skin-to-skin relationship to the coldness of two strangers, this huge gap that has turned sharply has made him feel down all the time these days. He is sad but the saddest thing is that he has no position to be sad about it.What\u2019s even more sad is that as long as he thinks that he can see Qu Moyu right away, he is easily ignited again.He hurriedly got off the elevator and ran to Qu Moyu\u2019s exclusive parking space. This area is a high-rise parking area, and there are very few people here. He still lowered his head, afraid of being seen.When he got into the car, Qu Moyu just looked at him with a light smile. He didn\u2019t look at the documents or his mobile phone this time. It was as if he was waiting for him.Shen Dai\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but jump in joy.\u201cCome.\u201d Qu Moyu stretched out his hand towards Shen Dai.Shen Dai hesitantly put his own hand on Qu Moyu\u2019s palm. Qu Moyu took his hand and dragged him towards him. He held him and brought him on his lap, pressed the tip of his nose against the back of his neck, and sniffed gently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShen Dai\u2019s face suddenly heated up, he lightly held Qu Moyu\u2019s hand that was wrapped around his waist, and quietly inserted his five fingers between Qu Moyu\u2019s fingers. He wanted to return the same affection but was trying hard not to feel embarrassed.Qu Moyu deliberately pinched his fingers, and Shen Dai made a \u2018hiss\u2019 in pain. He wanted to withdraw his hand, but his hand was clasped by Qu Moyu. There was a playful low laugh in his ear, and Shen Dai felt that his face was getting hotter and was about to burn.\u201cThe smell is so weak\u2026\u201d Qu Moyu muttered in dissatisfaction, biting on the pheromone barrier sticker with his teeth, peeled it off, and rubbed the tip of his nose on Shen Dai\u2019s glands, like opening the mud seal of a jar of wine, containing the long-awaited fragrance that was about to come out. He inhaled deeply, allowing the light fragrance of the ephemera flower to penetrate into his nose and lungs, as if to purify all the turbid air he had ingested this day in an instant. He pulled Shen Dai by his chin, held the soft lips, and kissed gently and attentively. This delicate kissing method was like tasting a dish unhurriedly.Shen Dai\u2019s body relaxed, he closed his eyes, and felt the collision. He kept up with the tip of his own tongue. Qu Moyu wrapped his fingers with a moderate amount of force, making him feel like he was being grasped firmly, and he was using much less of a force, so that his intention to grasp the other person was less so obvious.Qu Moyu licked his moist lips: \u201cWhy did you run away these days?\u201d\u201cI went home to see my grandma.\u201d\u201cOh, I thought you were shy and didn\u2019t dare to see me.\u201dShen Dai didn\u2019t know how to respond to this kind of flirting.Qu Moyu chuckled: \u201cLook, you\u2019re so easy to feel shy.\u201d\u201cMr. Qu, I\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat should you call me?\u201d\u201c\u2026Moyu.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Qu Moyu touched his soft hair and said regretfully, \u201cYou were more enthusiastic in those three days.\u201dIn order to hide his embarrassment, Shen Dai quickly explained: \u201cIt\u2019s because of estrus, so I was more\u2026\u201d\u201cMore what?\u201d Qu Moyu leaned closer to his ear and gently bit his earlobe, \u201cMore audacious? Well, I like you to be a little more audacious.\u201dShen Dai just felt like he wanted to jump out of the car.Qu Moyu\u2019s hand traced his back all the way to his buttock, his voice was bewitching: \u201cI will like it if you would take the initiative, can you act a little coquettish?\u201d\u201cI-I can learn.\u201dQu Moyu chuckled: \u201cDo you have to learn this too? You are an omega, isn\u2019t it instinctive?\u201dShen Dai\u2019s eyes kept blinking: \u201cMaybe I\u2019m not quite used to it yet.\u201d\u201cThen learn.\u201d Qu Moyu kissed Shen Dai\u2019s tender cheek, \u201cyou have to learn how to make me happy, for example, laugh often in front of me, take the initiative to get close to me, be coquettish, and, of course, you also need to be reserved when we\u2019re at work. But when I need you\u2026\u201d His kiss gradually went down, and went around the fragrant back of his neck, \u201cYou have to be audacious as much as you like.\u201d As soon as he finished speaking, he took a bite on the skin close to the gland.Shen Dai\u2019s body trembled, he couldn\u2019t help shrinking his shoulders. But he paused for a while before taking the initiative to wrap his hands around Qu Moyu\u2019s neck and cuddle into that generous chest.sIf he understood these words correctly, Qu Moyu asked him to learn to \u2018please\u2019 him. To \u2018please\u2019 is a very interesting word. It does not mean for both of them to achieve pleasure but it mostly means that Qu Moyu is more concerned about achieving the pleasure for himself. The pleasure on the bed\u2026It\u2019s just that he may not be able to do it well \u2013 he knows how to be nice to someone, but he doesn\u2019t know how to \u2018please\u2019 someone on the bed.\u201cGood, you will be rewarded if you do well.\u201d Qu Moyu said with a smile, \u201cYour grandma is sick, right? She has stage two stomach cancer and is going to have surgery soon.\u201dShen Dai stared at Qu Moyu blankly.\u201cThe hospital, the chief surgeon, post-operative care, adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and medication, I will help you solve them all, as a reward for your\u2026 \u2018service beyond the scope of the contract\u2019.\u201dShen Dai felt conflicted at the moment. He opened his mouth, not knowing what to say for a while. But then he hesitantly was only able to whisper a simple \u201cthank you\u201d. No one was willing to accept help from others over and over. Especially if the help came from someone they have feelings for. It is a heavy moral shackle, but there are many things in this world that are far more important than their dignity, such as the well-being of their family.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Qu Moyu is well versed in the art of control. In his opinion, everything in this world revolves around nothing but the exchange of value. There is the law of conservation of energy between substances, and there is also cause and effect between people. He ought to get what he wanted at a lower cost.The two were making out all the way until they got home. When they got out of the car, the ambiguous atmosphere did not completely dissipate. Qu Moyu did not deliberately avoid the knowing eyes of the driver and the housekeeper. It is obvious of what was happening between them so why should he bother covering up?After staying in Qu\u2019s house for three months, this was the second night that Shen Dai and Qu Moyu had dinner together in the dining hall. During this time, Qu Moyu asked some things about the research institute. Such topics brough Shen Dai to his comfort zone so he answered fluently.Before leaving the table after eating, Qu Moyu said to Shen Dai with a comfortable expression; \u201cI\u2019ll find you at night.\u201d His voice was neither too loud nor too small, making the declaration neither ostentatious nor concealed.sThis sentence made Shen Dai feel uneasy. After he returned to his room, he managed to calm down after reading more than ten pages of difficult literature review. Then he went to take a shower. He washed himself so hard that his skin was mostly reddened.It\u2019s too bad, he\u2019s never been one to get nervous easily. But once he is involved in anything that has something to do with Qu Moyu, he\u2019s always so nervous. Because this time is different from the other time. When he was in estrus, he had already lost his mind to instincts. But now that he is in a sober state, to do something like that with Qu Moyu, he really needs some psychological preparation.After coming out of the shower, he noticed that there were some toiletries on the washstand that were not there before. He looked around and found that there were also some bottles and cans in the shower that did not belong to him. And there were bathrobes that were obviously not his size hanging on the wall.Shen Dai walked out of the bathroom. When he opened the closet, he found that several sets of Qu Moyu\u2019s pyjamas were in there. Other than that, some condoms and lubricants were already neatly placed on the bedside table.Were these things he put in the days when he went home? Some vague memory fragments gave him a different answer. He now remembered that when he was tortured to the point of losing consciousness, Uncle Heng and Aunt Lan had come in his room more than once. They delivered meals, delivered various other things, and they also did some cleaning and arranging of the room. Meanwhile, Qu Moyu also made his phone calls, read through documents, and held video conferences using his laptop in this room.During those three days, he actually had memories of what had happened most of the time. But he was just ashamed to recall the memories so he instinctively tried to escape from them.He remembered the time when Uncle Heng came at first with a condom. Aunt Lan also later came with a bite stopper. He remembered how Qu Moyu was hitting his genital cavity, causing him a lot of pain. For an alpha, there is an instinctive urge to enter the genital cavity to form a knot and sow the seed for the next generation. But Qu Moyu would never do that. Whether it\u2019s a condom or a bite stopper, it\u2019s all to prevent himself from giving in to \u2018impulses\u2019 and prevent him from having an actual real connection with him.Qu Moyu just needs him to be a bed partner that he can use whenever he wants, and he is aware of it from the beginning till the end.Later into the night, Qu Moyu came to Shen Dai\u2019s room. Shen Dai gathered up his courage and took the initiative to hug him. He also tiptoed to reach his height to kiss him, and the two kissed all the way from the door to the bed.Sex in a sober state caused him to sink endlessly\u2026When he went to work the next day, Shen Dai yawned all morning.Qu Moyu only did it once with him last night. But an S-class Alpha\u2019s physical fitness was unbelievable. The result was he ended up being tired and sleepy, and he woke up late again in the morning.While checking the data, Shen Dai heard some noises outside the laboratory door. He looked out through the window and saw a group of people were passing by his door. He saw many familiar figures, including the people from other research institutes. There was also another familiar person over there. It\u2019s one of whom he didn\u2019t wish to see the most. But he unseen him because of his superior height and appearance \u2013 Qu Chengchen.Shen Dai knew that Qu Chengchen was here to visit a laboratory related to the chemical business and would not come to him, but he still hid behind his desk. Although he resented Qu Chengchen for provoking him twice and making things difficult for him, he also knew that he wanted nothing to do with this S-class alpha.Unexpectedly, half an hour later, the director of the office knocked on the door of his laboratory, walked in with the same group of people, and said diligently: \u201cShen Gong, Mr. Qu said that he also wanted to come here to visit, if you are not busy with whatever you have in hand, drop the work first?\u201dCheng Zimei is not here. So, Shen Dai, as the only person in charge here, can\u2019t hide at all. His eyes quickly swept across to see Qu Chengchen\u2019s half-smiling face and politely greeted: \u201cHello Mr. Qu, and everyone. If you don\u2019t mind, I will explain to you what we\u2019ve been working on here.\u201dShen Dai took them around in the laboratory. After explaining, he sent a few interns to explain the rest to those who still had questions.\u201cShen Gong, we met again.\u201d Qu Chengchen walked in front of Shen Dai with a very decent smile, \u201cI feel very sorry for you about what happened last time. I heard that you went to the hospital later.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I worked too much overtime during that time, and I was just a little tired.\u201d Shen Dai mustered the courage to look directly at Qu Chengchen, at least in front of so many people and in his own laboratory, he had the confidence, \u201d Mr. Qu didn\u2019t affect me.\u201dQu Chengchen replied with a meaningful \u201cOh\u2026\u201d He then said; \u201cThat\u2019s good. Otherwise, if I question the content of your speech again and then let you be affected by pheromones, I feel like I was bullying you.\u201d\u201cI also don\u2019t like this word \u2018bullying\u2019. It makes us look like elementary school students.\u201d Shen Dai said with a smile, \u201cbut when you fight between brothers, you always piss me off. What word should be used to define this kind of behaviour?\u201d\u201dSurprise flashed in Qu Chengchen\u2019s eyes. His whole life growing up as an S-class Alpha, at least after the complete differentiation, he had never met any omega who would dare to provoke him. As the king of the jungle, an S-class Alpha will only receive obedience from omegas most of the time. He is especially surprised since the one in front of him who had provoked him had been quiet and docile before. Even if he didn\u2019t quite look like any other omegas, he was still no different from an ordinary omega. So when he saw obvious anger and ridicule in Shen Dai\u2019s eyes, he felt a suspicion in his heart that this omega\u2019s \u201c\u2019quiet and docile image\u201d was not displayed for him, but it was only to be displayed in front of Qu Moyu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQu Chengchen laughed and said, \u201cYou are really interesting.\u201d\u201cMr. Qu, you don\u2019t have the same knowledge as me. Why don\u2019t you find an opponent of the same level as you?\u201d\u201cThe same level as me?\u201d Qu Chengchen said with a playful expression, \u201cYou are quite docile in front of my eldest brother but it turns out you do have claws.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s my boss.\u201d\u201cStop pretending, do you think no one can tell that you have feelings for him?\u201dShen Dai put his hands in the pockets of his lab coat, and looked at Qu Chengchen coldly: \u201cHow do you know? Did I say it when I gave a speech?\u201d\u201cYou think you\u2019re good at hiding it.\u201d Qu Chengchen wrapped his arms around his chest with a smirk on his face, \u201cIn the laboratory accident three years ago, an omega suddenly became in heat. That was you, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHe suppressed the matter from being made public, but I still found out. As a result, three years later, it was too \u2018coincidental\u2019 that you were in estrus again in front of him.\u201d Qu Chengchen raised his eyebrows, \u201cDid you get what you wanted this time?\u201dShen Dai\u2019s hands clenched into fists in his pockets. If he could ignore any consequences and if he had any odds of winning, he would really beat up Qu Chengchen right now: \u201cAre you implying that I did it on purpose?\u201d\u201cI think a person who can enter a research institute should be smart enough not to do reckless stupid things, but these two times\u2026\u201d Qu Chengchen said mockingly, \u201cIs it \u2018fate\u2019?\u201dShen Dai scolded Qu Chengchen for being shameless in his heart. If it wasn\u2019t for him deliberately making things difficult for Shen Dai during his speech, how could he have such a bad reaction? But he didn\u2019t answer his rhetorical question.Qu Chengchen smiled and said, \u201cAt that time, in order to appease you, he gave you a temporary mark, right? Do you want a real and permanent mark?\u201dShen Dai narrowed his eyes, holding back his anger.\u201cI don\u2019t need to hear your answer. Which omega in this world doesn\u2019t want to get an S-class Alpha\u2019s mark. But unfortunately, he won\u2019t give it to you.\u201dShen Dai wanted to laugh a little, but couldn\u2019t. That\u2019s right, every omega wants to get the mark of a loved one. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to do with the conditions of heirs or property. This is because there are many, many other omegas in this world that only want the mark as the promise of love and loyalty. It\u2019s just that no S-class Alpha would believe that. In the worldview of an S-class Alpha, the mark has nothing to do with feelings. It was just an official seal stamped on the contract for exclusive reproduction rights and property separation. The omega who made them willing to sign the contract must provide enticing terms in return.He knows this better than anyone else. At the time, he couldn\u2019t help begging Qu Moyu to mark him, but he was also lustful and confused due to estrus. Qu Chengchen\u2019s words are undoubtedly making no sense.Shen Dai\u2019s tone was already extremely rude: \u201cWhat are you trying to imply? What are you planning to do?\u201d\u201cI can help you.\u201d Qu Chengchen stared at Shen Dai meaningfully, \u201cI can help you get Qu Moyu\u2019s mark.\u201dShen Dai regretted that he was well-trained in his manners. Thus, he still chose to hold back the swear words that were about to rush out of his mouth. He simply spoke sarcastically: \u201cI told you already. Go find an opponent on the same level as you. Why should you lower yourself to entertain me?\u201d\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a head-to-head confrontation yet. I\u2019m tired of being competitive. Who told him to be born eight months earlier than me?\u201d Qu Chengchen pouted, \u201cIt\u2019s only eight months. But he was born gloriously while I was born as the beginning of future problems.\u201dThe affairs of your family really have nothing to do with me. If you tell me this, are you not afraid that I will tell Qu Moyu?\u201d\u201cWould you?\u201d Qu Chengchen still portrayed a cold smile, \u201cAsk yourself. Do you think that what I just said was no concerns of yours? Even if you don\u2019t have the guts, you also won\u2019t have the guts to tell Qu Moyu about our conversation today. Wouldn\u2019t he be wary of you?\u201dShen Dai glared at Qu Chengchen. He didn\u2019t want to stay for another moment. So he turned and left.Qu Chengchen\u2019s methods do not seem to be justified. But they all point in the right direction. Whether it is to use You Baiyue or using Shen Dai himself, they are all done in order to suppress Qu Moyu. As he had said, they are entangled by blood relationship, family and also the public\u2019s view. Due to these limitations, he could not confront Qu Moyu head-on, so he used hidden methods, and Shen Dai was inevitably dragged into it.Although Qu Moyu had said that he had to tell him everything that Qu Chengchen had said to him, Shen Dai really couldn\u2019t tell him. This is because the topic of \u2018marking\u2019 is too sensitive to be mentioned. He didn\u2019t dare to bring it up in front of Qu Moyu. It would seem like he is coveting something that does not belong to him. After all, Qu Moyu himself had also \u2018warned\u2019 him.At the same time, he also knew very well that Qu Chengchen would not give up on this idea. So, he had to be careful and protect himself from being pulled into this whirlpool.On Friday afternoon, Shen Dai received a call from Cheng Ruoze, Qu Moyu\u2019s assistant, who wanted to arrange for his grandmother to see a doctor. On the phone, he specifically asked Cheng Ruoze to pretend to be a friend who helped him so as to not let his grandmother know too much details about going to this kind of hospital.Cheng Ruoze brought a driver to take them to the hospital on Saturday morning.Grandma knew that she was going to switch hospitals and doctors, so she was somewhat nervous. Shen Dai kept comforting her, but she was worried all the way. From the previous night until now, no matter what Shen Dai said, she still looked so absent-minded.When Cheng Ruoze went to go through the formalities, Shen Dai waited in the rest area with his grandmother. Seeing that his grandmother was still in a low mood, he looked for a video of a panda cub for her to watch and wanted to amuse her.His grandma smiled reluctantly.\u201cGrandma, don\u2019t be afraid. We have better hospitals and better doctors. Your operation will definitely be a success. This is a good thing, right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not afraid, I wish that I had the surgery earlier.\u201d Grandma patted Shen Dai\u2019s hand, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d\u201cThen why do you always look so uncomfortable?\u201d Shen Dai teased, \u201cYou\u2019re this old already but you\u2019re still afraid of seeing a doctor.\u201dHis grandma sighed softly. She then looked at Shen Dai but hesitated to speak. It can be seen in her eyes that she was a bit sad.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s heart also became uncomfortable.\u201cYour dad called me yesterday.\u201d His grandma seemed to be unable to hide it any longer and quickly threw the heavy load in her chest out.Shen Dai\u2019s face suddenly sank. He wanted to ridicule with a statement \u201che didn\u2019t die yet\u201d at first, but he couldn\u2019t bear to say it. Even if that person was no longer worthy of being called a son to his grandma, he knew that there were few mothers who could really let go of their sons. He took a deep breath, calmed his own heartbeat, and spoke in a muffled voice, \u201cHe has been missing for several years.\u201d\u201cHmm, but I\u2019ve always had a hunch in my heart that he\u2019ll be back sooner or later.\u201dShen Dai gritted his teeth and said, \u201cWhat are you going to do when he comes back? You\u2019re going to get along just fine with him? What else do we have in the family that he can sell?\u201dHis grandma\u2019s eyes were red: \u201cHe didn\u2019t say where he was, or what he wanted to do. He just\u2026 he said he missed his mother.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s chest was suffocated as if it was blocked by something. But he knew that it was hatred that suffocated him.Seven years ago, it was the time when he was preparing for his graduation thesis. He was also doing an internship at the research institute on the side, seeking a place in the talent plan. He was aiming to get a high-paying job opportunity that is to join the Xingzhou Group Rare Earth Research Institute. It is the dream of every person who studied rare earth to be in the research institute. At that time, he was only twenty years old, with excellent grades and a promising future. He had a grandmother and grandfather who loved him, a warm and beautiful home, and he was full of bright expectations for the future.But all this was ruined by his biological Omega father.That selfish beast sold off all the property in the family as a mortgage for his boyfriend. They lost everything overnight, and they also carried huge debts. His grandpa was very sad and fell ill. His grandma, who had lived a good life, was forced to move to a low-rent apartment, and all the expenses in the future were covered only by his salary. The rent, living expenses, and medical expenses were so overwhelming that he could hardly breathe. If he did not receive any help from his teacher at that time, he did not know how he would get through it all.Shen Dai was reluctant to recall those most difficult years of his life. There are also other classmates and colleagues who came from very poor places around him, who are trying to live a good life. He does not feel sorry for himself. He is tired from work, stressed, and poor. He can bear all these, and accepts that he cannot be like a normal person. It is difficult for him to fall in love, get married, and start a family. His real and deep pain comes from the betrayal of his own close relatives. It was also painful to see the pain carried by the person he loves but unable to do anything about it.Later, his salary increased and\u00a0 he received some project bonuses. So, his life has improved. And then, Qu Moyu dropped from the sky in a dramatic way, completely dragging him out of the quagmire.He thought everything would be fine now, but why did the old culprit appear again?!His grandma took Shen Dai\u2019s hands and spoke softly, \u201cAh Dai, don\u2019t be angry. I know you don\u2019t want to see him. I won\u2019t let him come back. To me, he\u2026 he is already dead.\u201dShen Dai held his grandmother\u2019s hands instead, with thin bones and dry skin. These are a pair of old hands. These hands had comforted him to sleep, cooked hot meals for him, and gave him support without expecting anything in return. He could really feel that the wound in grandma\u2019s heart that never healed was torn even more. His nose was sore, and his heart was aching. He put his arms around his grandma\u2019s shoulders. He wanted to say something comforting, but he didn\u2019t know what to say.Shen Dai knew that his omega father would definitely come back. That person, who had been spoiled since childhood, was extremely selfish and willful. He also would do whatever he wanted to do, never caring about how it would impact others.He made up his mind to move away as soon as possible and changed his grandma\u2019s cell phone number. It would be best if that bastard would never find them in his life and that they never communicate with each other again. That is the best outcome for both father and son.After a busy day in the hospital, he communicated with the new chief surgeon about the treatment plan, and the operation time is set to be done in the next month.When they got home, the two of them were tired. Grandma went to bed early after eating. Shen Dai was lying in bed but couldn\u2019t sleep. Everything that happened recently made him anxious and irritable, but he couldn\u2019t see a solution to it. All these issues. Whether it is the issue of his grandmother\u2019s health or of his own feelings, they are far beyond his control. So he can only passively deal with them one by one.Shen Dai stared at his phone and couldn\u2019t help but to click on Qu Moyu\u2019s dialog box again. He stared at the tree\u2019s grey-black bark avatar in a daze.\u2018I miss him, what is he doing? If they were in Qu\u2019s house now, would the two of them be having sex now\u2019\u2026\u00a0He thought to himself.Shen Dai suddenly wanted to get a reply from Qu Moyu, even if it was a single word. He does not want any cold verification information. He started to type, hesitated for a long time, deleted, deleted, modified, and bothered with it for a long time, not knowing what to send. He was thinking of what to say that will sound natural and will make the possibility of Qu Moyu replying higher.When he thought about it, he should thank him and don\u2019t talk nonsense. Sincere thanks will not be surprising at all and it is also something that he should do.He sent a paragraph:\u00a0All the procedures for my grandma have been completed, and the operation time is scheduled to be done in the middle of next month. Director Bai is very confident about it. Thank you.After sending this sentence, Shen Dai started to wait with his mobile phone in his hands. No matter what he did, he would turn to look at the WeChat interface every other minutes. He was full of expectations but he was disappointed over and over.It wasn\u2019t until one hour and seventeen minutes later that Qu Moyu\u2019s avatar had a red dot on the number for the first time. He replied with a simple:\u00a0You\u2019re welcome.Shen Dai stared at their conversation for a long time, hesitated again and again, but finally said:\u00a0good night.This \u2018good night\u2019 wish was like a stone sinking into the sea. There was no reply all night.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.04.11\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s Note: I like how this novel insinuate real life problems as well regarding gender discrimination at work and also in the family setting. Thank God I really am not living in ABO world. If not, I might get more headache. I love SQC so much that I\u2019m even influenced by her schedule lol. So give me holidays on weekends. I will publish the next chapter on Monday onwards. -KPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 21": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShen Dai signed the house purchase contract. He then completed the bank loan application and transfer procedures accompanied by the intermediary.The moment he got the key, Shen Dai felt like a heavy stone was lifted from the bottom of his heart. It gave him a sense of fulfilment and stability. He had carefully chosen a lower monthly payment plan. His job in the research institute is said to be very stable. Even if he loses his job one day, he can still find another with his achievements and experiences listed in his resume. All that will be left to deal with are his grandmother\u2019s medical expenses and their living expenses. At present, this kind of financial distribution is the most reasonable and he can now save some money for emergencies.He had planned in his mind on how to make simple decorations for the new house, what other things to buy, and how long it would take until he is able to move in. It is best to be able to move into a new home when his grandmother is discharged from the hospital after the operation. Once all the bad karma in his life is cut out, the future seems to be full of vitality with the existence of a new home.His grandmother will be very happy.Shen Dai was lost in a reverie. He was looking for ideas on simple clothes online. At the same time, he was looking at furniture, household appliances and daily necessities as well. It was not until Cheng Zimei had asked him to go to eat lunch that he realised he had not done any real work all morning.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the cafeteria today. Oh, that knife-cut noodle is so delicious. I\u2019ve been thinking about it if I don\u2019t get to eat it for a few days.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Shen Dai is in a very good mood, \u201cZimei, I have good news to tell you.\u201d\u201cWhat good news?\u201d\u201cMy grandma\u2019s surgery is finally scheduled. The chief surgeon is a specialist. It will be done by next month.\u201dCheng Zimei cheered happily: \u201cWow, that\u2019s great! The operation will definitely be a success. I will then visit the hospital to see your grandma.\u201d\u201cNo need to visit the hospital. You can visit her at home. We\u2019ll move to a new house soon.\u201d\u201cWhere are you moving to?\u201dShen Dai didn\u2019t tell Cheng Zimei that he bought a house. He only told her that he had re-rented a better house closer to his workplace so that he could take better care of his grandmother.The two chatted all the way to the cafeteria.While queuing to get lunch, Shen Dai somehow feels that some people are peeking a look at him. They are also whispering something to each other.He thinks that maybe he is being too sensitive, but Cheng Zimei also quickly realises that something is off: \u201cAre those people looking at us?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dThey look at each other and find nothing out of the ordinary on any of them. But Shen Dai is afraid if it is because he was too careless. Those people\u2019s \u2018eyes\u2019 on them had become more and more bold and rude.\u201cLet\u2019s just pack up and eat at the office.\u201d\u201cWhy do we have to?\u201d Cheng Zimei is also starting to get angry so she speaks loudly, \u201cJust look if you want. I\u2019m so beautiful.\u201dSome people looked away immediately.The two find a corner to sit down. They then spread their hands and shake their heads in a daze, feeling confused.At this moment, Cheng Zimei\u2019s handphone suddenly vibrates. She opens a gossip group that she joined. She suddenly gasps loudly as she sees something shocking. She holds her handphone in front of Shen Dai. The movement was so large that she almost slapped Shen Dai\u2019s face: \u201cThis! It\u2019s you.\u201dIt was a surveillance low-resolution GIF image. Qu Moyu strode past holding a man in his arms wrapped in a windbreaker, confirming some rumours about Shen Dai some time ago.Shen Dai stared stiffly at the repeated image.Suddenly, he feels his foot is in pain. Cheng Zimei had kicked him.\u201cYou lied to me!\u201d Cheng Zimei accused angrily. \u201cWhat\u2019s the relationship between the two of you? You\u2019re actually hiding it from me! Shen Dai, you are so fucking stupid.\u201dShen Dai presses her shoulders to calm her down as he covers her mouth to ensure she no longer speaks loudly: \u201cDon\u2019t make trouble, auntie, please, I apologise, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dCheng Zimei\u2019s eyes are full of anger but at the same time, there is a flash of excitement.Shen Dai sighed, \u201cLet\u2019s pack it up.\u201dCheng Zimei wraps her arms around her chest. Her face looks stern as she listens to Shen Dai\u2019s \u2018honest explanation\u2019. But she is still not satisfied after listening: \u201cThat\u2019s it? You almost fainted because of the alpha pheromone. And the prince took you to the hospital?\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d Shen Dai didn\u2019t want to lie to his best friend, but so many things have happened between him and Qu Moyu. As time goes on, there will be more things to hide. Cheng Zimei might not reveal the sensational truth. Cheng Zimei is just this kind of character. She has a cheerful personality. She may not look like a big deal, but no ordinary person can enter the Rare Earth Research Institute. But he had signed a non-disclosure agreement. So, Qu Moyu\u2019s privacy must be kept hidden.\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me the truth.\u201d Cheng Zimei glared at him. \u201cI\u2019ll sort out the current gossip trend for you.\u201d\u201cNo need\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how this surveillance got leaked out. But it\u2019s probably not because of you. It must be because of Yan Mingxiu. If Yan Mingxiu was photographed leaving with you in his arms, it would be more wonderful. After all, he just got married, and he married a new actor. This gossip will be sensational. But for our company\u2026\u201d Cheng Zimei suddenly became excited, \u201cThis is the crown prince! Tell me what it feels like to be hugged by the crown prince and become a princess!\u201dShen Dai only looks at her helplessly.He believes that this leak of internal monitoring must be related to Yan Mingxiu. But unfortunately, they do not find any gossip that they could make a fuss with about him.Yan Mingxiu\u2019s wife, Zhou Xiang, is one of the actors with the best momentum in recent years. He is a beta. No one is optimistic about a marriage between an S-class alpha with a beta. A beta has no pheromone awareness and cannot be marked. So why? Taking advantage of Zhou Xiang\u2019s popularity, many paparazzi are staring at them for more sensational gossip.For Shen Dai, this was like a disaster. He recalled his short-lived impression of Yan Mingxiu. Apart from his stunning appearance, what he remembered most clearly was Yan Mingxiu\u2019s decisiveness when he rejected him. At that time, Yan Mingxiu misunderstood what he meant by \u2018help me\u2019. He might be thinking that he wanted a temporary mark.When an omega is in heat, the alpha\u2019s temporary marker can appease him and avoid further serious consequences. Although sometimes it will only act as a last resort in an emergency, it is still a very delicate issue for married people. At least, no one is willing to have their own alpha marking others, even temporarily.He always has a hunch that the \u2018materials\u2019 that the paparazzi would want will never come true.\u201cMy God!\u201d Cheng Zimei slapped the table suddenly, startling Shen Dai. She immediately shrugs her shoulders, looks around to make sure that no one is listening and whispers to Shen Dai, \u201cWhat kind of fate do you have? Think about it, back then, when you had an accident in the laboratory, he rescued you. And this time, he helped you again. This is just like TV dramas. The idol dramas of domineering presidents are mostly with this plot.\u201d\u201cWatch less drama. Don\u2019t you have enough work?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t interrupt me. After that, he took you to the hospital? What did the two of you say and do? Wait, shouldn\u2019t he be using his car? Holy shit! After going to the hospital, did he say a few words to you, express his concern or something like that? Is there no more contact after that?\u201d Cheng Zimei asked a bunch of questions like machine guns being fired. The whole person is obviously very excited.\u201cNo, I was so uncomfortable at the time that I almost vomited in his car. Later, it was his driver who took me to the hospital. I can\u2019t remember most of them. We didn\u2019t say anything to each other anyway. He helped me because I am his employee. .\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe it. You must have caught his attention.\u201d Cheng Zimei pondered; \u201cBy the way, when you were giving a speech, he argued with Qu Chengchen to defend you. How obvious.\u201d\u201cHe was defending his project.\u201d\u201cWhy are you so stupid?\u201d Cheng Zimei glared at him with hatred. \u201cDidn\u2019t you always like the crown prince? He is such a perfect S-class alpha, who once saved you. Then, you have a chance now. He is so good-looking, smart, and has a good personality. You should try to get close to him.\u201dShen Dai covered his face with one hand: \u201cCan you be more realistic?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible, you know? Love is blind after all!\u201dShen Dai shakes his head dismissively: \u201cDon\u2019t say anything anymore. Let\u2019s get our work done or this day will be wasted.\u201d\u201cWait\u2026\u201d Cheng Zimei swiped her phone, \u201cWow, it was posted on Weibo. Although the prince never uses social media, many people still know him. Do you know about \u2018Alpha Predator Club\u2019?\u201d\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a club of stalking netizens. They made a list of the S-class alphas of marriageable age that can be found in China. From all walks of life. From politics, business, academia, literature, art, sports, and such. There are many of them. Well, as soon as there is any gossip about an S-class alpha, they will share it here. The most discussed one today is definitely about you and him.\u201d\u201cOkay, okay. I beg you.\u201d Shen Dai presses her hand down from holding up her phone. \u201cI\u2019m depressed enough. Let this slide already.\u201dSeeing that he is really irritable, Cheng Zimei says angrily; \u201cUnfortunately, if it were another omega, they would have rushed forward. They wanted to seduce the crown prince, and he had expelled them three times in a row. You have such a good chance\u2026 But yeah, you don\u2019t have that ability.\u201dShen Dai echoed in his heart;\u00a0I really don\u2019t have that ability.When he takes the subway at night, Shen Dai opens Weibo to see. He endures himself from doing so all afternoon. Finally, he can\u2019t help but want to check the reviews. However, he finds that the news has died out. Although there are still people discussing topics related to it, there are obviously many popular Weibo posts that have been deleted. Xingzhou\u2019s public relations ability is evidently good.When he returns to Qu\u2019s house, it is just time for dinner. It is rare for Qu Moyu to not go out these days. He came back early. As soon as he enters the door, he notices that the Qu Moyu has changed into his home clothes and is ready to eat.Seeing Shen Dai, Qu Moyu appears to look as usual: \u201cYou\u2019re back. Come and eat dinner.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s eyes flicker a little. He doesn\u2019t know what Qu Moyu is thinking about the gossip. After all, it happened because of him. Qu Moyu is the kind of person who would be very disgusted by people paying too much attention to him inside the company. It is probably because he was afraid of trouble, but now he has already become the object of discussion.Shen Dai greets him and sits down quietly beside him, trying to reduce his presence as much as possible.\u201cYou all go out.\u201d Qu Moyu ordered.Uncle Heng and the others tacitly disappeared in a blink of an eye. Only the two of them were left in the huge restaurant.Shen Dai sighs quietly: \u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cDid it affect you?\u201d\u201cUh, no. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say to the others?\u201d\u201cThat I just bumped into you when you went to the toilet. And that it was actually Lao Wu who took me to the hospital.\u201dQu Moyu nods and glances at Shen Dai lightly: \u201cI found that you are quite a trouble. But I don\u2019t blame you.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s body froze for a moment: \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Qu Moyu said, \u201cThe person who leaked the surveillance video has also been found and has been dealt with.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good to know.\u201d\u201cIn the future, you need to be more careful. Although the accident three years ago has been suppressed as much as possible, and everyone who saw it has signed a non-disclosure agreement, there is no airtight wall in this world. You should pay more attention, such as to your friends and so on. Okay?\u201d Qu Moyu shook the glass in his hand and took a sip, \u201cI don\u2019t like to be involved in anything other than work at the company, especially my personal life.\u201dShen Dai once again feels the invisible sense of oppression, and he whispers, \u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s eat dinner.\u201dShen Dai picks up the chopsticks and looks at the table full of delicious food but he has no appetite.\u201cAre you not hungry?\u201d Qu Moyu pinched Shen Dai\u2019s chin with a half-smile displayed on his face, \u201cWould you like to have an appetiser?\u201dShen Dai looks at Qu Moyu confusedly.Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes move down, gesturing at his crotch, and then he spreads his legs open.After Shen Dai understood what he meant, his mind went black for a moment. And then his face burned up to the base of his ears.\u201cHmm?\u201d Qu Moyu slightly increased the strength of his fingers, causing Shen Dai\u2019s jaw to hurt, but his expression still seemed peaceful.Shen Dai took a deep breath, his heart was beating like a drum. He wanted to get up and leave, but he didn\u2019t dare to. No matter whether it is due to social status or physical level, he never dared to disobey any word of Qu Moyu. His order is absolute. With such power he held, it\u2019s not worth refusing anything in his face. Also not to mention, he knows that Qu Moyu is already angry, so this is a tactful punishment for himself. If he is smart, he mustn\u2019t provoke a beast at this time.Shen Dai endured the humiliation, got under the table, knelt between Qu Moyu\u2019s legs, and pulled down the pants of his silk home clothes with trembling hands\u2026There were sounds of unspeakable movements in the closed dining hall.Qu Moyu looks down on Shen Dai. His fair and cold face is distorted, flushed with irritation, and physiological tears fall from the corners of his eyes. It makes those clean and transparent eyes look pitiful. He strokes Shen Dai\u2019s soft hair. The pleasure of conquest trumps over even the pleasure of the body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 22": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThat night, Qu Moyu was very interested and fucked Shen Dai all night. After being satisfied, he did not go back to his room, but fell asleep with Shen Dai in his arms.At 7:30 the next morning, the two are awakened by the alarm clock at the same time. Originally, Shen Dai could wake up naturally without setting an alarm clock. But he was very much tired out by Qu Moyu so he inevitably overslept.Shen Dai is so sleepy that he couldn\u2019t even open his eyes. He follows the sound of the alarm and reaches out to take his mobile phone. He finally turns off the alarm clock. In the next second, he was dragged back into Qu Moyu\u2019s arms.Shen Dai struggles for a while but cannot break free. So he whispers, \u201cI have to get up.\u201dQu Moyu puts his face against the back of Shen Dai\u2019s neck and inhales lightly, letting the elegant floral fragrance penetrate into his lungs. He did not respond, nor did he relax his arms from holding Shen Dai back.Shen Dai sighs. He grabs Qu Moyu\u2019s arms and tries to push them away.Qu Mo only wraps his arms around him tighter as an answer. Shen Dai\u2019s body is fragrant and warm. He doesn\u2019t want to let go at all.Shen Dai speaks again. \u201cI want to go to work.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s voice was hoarse and drowsy. It echoes in his ears and it is extraordinarily bewitching.\u201cThat\u2019s not good. I didn\u2019t ask for a leave in advance.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m the boss.\u201d Qu Moyu was wrapped in the warm quilt and the comfort created by the omega in his arms. He hasn\u2019t enjoyed enough. He never allowed himself to be indulged in ecstasy. But this is his home, this person is his wife, so it\u2019s okay to indulge once in a while.Shen Dai holds the phone in his hand, hesitating whether to send a message to Cheng Zimei to ask for leave, or to wait for Qu Moyu to fall back asleep. In fact, whether he goes to work or not does not matter. He just wanted to get up. He used to want to be as close as possible to Qu Moyu, whether intentionally or not. He likes hugs more than sex. He likes the feeling of being surrounded by warmth and strength. However at this moment, he can\u2019t help but want to distance himself.He is beginning to feel that he doesn\u2019t understand Qu Moyu more and more. In fact, he doesn\u2019t understand him at first because he was so out of reach before. His gratitude and admiration towards Qu Moyu constantly beautify the image he has of Qu Moyu. When Qu Moyu was under the blessing of the halo, all of his flaws were covered up, like a perfect man standing on the altar. Now that he is close to him, his gratitude and admiration have not disappeared, but he has been enlightened by the \u2018reality\u2019 of this person\u2019s true self. He is arrogant, domineering, and condescending. Qu Moyu may never intentionally hurt or humiliate him, but he doesn\u2019t care about his feelings. It is just like how people don\u2019t care about the joys and sorrows of insects.Obviously they have had a skin-to-skin relationship. Obviously they were hugging each other at the moment. But there is always a distance between them.Shen Dai sighs in his heart and turns on his phone to ask for leave. But he sees a picture that Cheng Zimei sent to him last night, followed by a message from her:\u00a0He did it on purpose, too green tea! ! ! ! !Shen Dai clicked on the picture, which is a screenshot of You Baiyue\u2019s Weibo post. You Baiyue showed a tie ring with a dazzling colourful treasure on it. \u2018Thank you Brother Yu for giving me a birthday present. I like Paraiba very much recently. You are so caring~~\u2019 was the caption.It turns out that today is Yu Baiyue\u2019s birthday.When the surveillance video of him and Qu Moyu was widely discussed online yesterday, You Baiyue posted such a Weibo, which seemed to be a bit deliberate, like a demonstration to the public. After all, Qu Moyu first came to the eyes of netizens because of You Baiyue \u2018being pursued by two S-class alphas\u2019. It is a big label on You Baiyue\u2019s popularity. You Baiyue\u2019s character is a rich young master who is loved by thousands of people.Shen Dai originally had no interest in these gossip matters. No matter what You Baiyue\u2019s purpose was, he doesn\u2019t care. Shen Dai himself is inexplicably panicked as he realised that these things that he usually didn\u2019t care about would even get to him. It should not continue. He hastily replied to Cheng Zimei to ask her help asking for a leave for him, and put down the phone.The arms around his waist were solid and strong, as if the person was afraid that he would leave. But Shen Dai knows in his heart that it wasn\u2019t anything like that. Sometimes he wonders why they had been intimate yet remained so distant.Qu Moyu squints his eyes for a while in a daze. He probably feels that the person in his arms is being too quiet, almost motionless. So he opens his eyes and sees that Shen Dai\u2019s body is half-curled with his back to him. It is as if nothing but the hoop of his arms on the waist is the only thing that unites them while the rest of his body is instinctively trying to move away.Qu Moyu frowns and orders softly, \u201cTurn around.\u201dShen Dai doesn\u2019t move. He pretends that he had fallen asleep. Qu Moyu pulls his body over. He is aware that he is pretending to sleep but he just lets him pretend. Shen Dai buries his face in the pillow as much as possible.Qu Moyu notices something: \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you wanted to go to work?\u201dShen Dai immediately opens his eyes and is about to get up.Qu Moyu presses him back down on the bed: \u201cI didn\u2019t say you can go.\u201dShen Dai was stunned for a moment, looking a little dazed, but then lay down again on the bed and buried his face into the pillow.Qu Moyu raises his chin and chuckles: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Are you upset? Did I wrong you?\u201d Although Shen Dai usually doesn\u2019t talk much, when no one else is present, he will usually take the initiative to stay close to himself. The awkwardness that was suppressed had accidentally revealed something Qu Moyu had never seen before. It turns out that this person also has a small temper. It is interesting.\u201cNo.\u201d Shen Dai doesn\u2019t believe that Qu Moyu would care about his mood. Qu Moyu\u2019s mood at the moment was probably about the same as teasing a pet. He lowers his eyes, \u201cAren\u2019t we going to get up?\u201d\u201cWhy are you unhappy? Did I scare you?\u201d Qu Moyu rubs his soft hair, \u201cI really didn\u2019t blame you. Why do I feel like I\u2019ve wronged you?\u201dShen Dai explains calmly and seriously: \u201cI\u2019m not unhappy.\u201d He has no right to be unhappy.Qu Moyu slightly purses his lips: \u201cThen smile for me.\u201dShen Dai smiles without realising that he was smiling stiffly.\u201cYou look good when you smile. I want you to smile more in the future.\u201d Qu Moyu kisses Shen Dai\u2019s eyebrows, \u201cI\u2019m going to wash up and ask Uncle Heng to deliver breakfast and my clothes to the room.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t until he heard the sound of the bathroom door closing that Shen Dai fell back on the bed.After the two of them washed up, Uncle Heng brought breakfast and a hanger with Qu Moyu\u2019s suit hanging on it.Qu Moyu took a bite of the fried egg, and thought about his clothes while chewing: \u201cUncle Heng, I have a brown tie with diagonal stripes, can you find it for me? It\u2019s Xiaoyue\u2019s birthday party tonight. I\u2019m going over directly after I finish work tonight.\u201d\u201cIs it the one that Young Master You gave you a few years ago?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s chopsticks hit the plate. The sound is dull, not attracting much attention, just like his own trembling heart.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll find it.\u201d\u201cBy the way, has the gift for him been delivered?\u201d\u201cIt was delivered. Young Master You likes it very much.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dAfter Uncle Heng leaves, Shen Dai finishes his breakfast in a few quick bites and wants to leave. He wanted to say, \u201cI\u2019ll go out for a walk\u201c, but walking in the winter morning is a stupid excuse. There is no reason for him not to look at it. How can he watch Qu Moyu put on the tie given by You Baiyue?After several thoughts in his mind, he says calmly as usual: \u201cI\u2019m done eating, I\u2019ll go check the mail.\u201dQu Moyu was also looking at his phone, nodding in agreement.Shen Dai sits in front of the computer, planning to read the email for a while. He then pretends to make a phone call and walks out of the room naturally.But after a while, Qu Moyu came over. He bent over him, supported the table with one hand, and joked, \u201cWhy do you seem to be busier than me?\u201dShen Dai quickly got up. Qu Moyu took advantage of the situation to sit in his chair, and then pulled him to sit on his lap: \u201cIt happens that an overseas partner asks me some questions in the field of research, please explain it to me.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dQu Moyu asked about the progress of the project and several highly professional questions. Although Qu Moyu has a better understanding of all aspects of the rare earth industry than ordinary people, there are still many things that are difficult to understand when it comes to the technical level. Shen Dai explained patiently, only at this time, when he was able to show his knowledge and strengths, would he have a brief illusion that he and Qu Moyu were equal.Qu Moyu also likes Shen Dai being chatty. He always remembered Shen Dai on the podium that day. He was confident, professional, calm, and generous. At the same time, he was very good-looking and had an irresistible charm. At that moment, he realised that Shen Dai, who was usually submissive in front of him, had another side to him. He only pretended to be submissive but of course, it must also be because of his own unquestionable dominance.It is rare for an omega to be able to speak freely in a room full of alphas, and to deal with deliberate difficulties in the face of it. He has looked through Shen Dai\u2019s resume. He has achieved excellent grades from childhood to high school. He went to famous schools, famous enterprises. He has high knowledge, high salaries, and a bright future. No wonder he is highly regarded by Professor Liu. To achieve such an achievement at the age of 27 even among alphas is remarkable. Shen Dai is just an omega, a gender that is limited everywhere on the road to self-realisation.At that time, he looked at Shen Dai on the stage, thinking that this was his wife, and had a subtle feeling in his heart of maybe\u2026 Feeling satisfied and proud?Then, Shen Dai revealed his gender during the alpha pheromone fight. As an alpha, he could almost guess what unclean thoughts would arise in the minds of the surrounding alphas at that moment. A handsome, young, and outstanding omega that displays both power and vulnerability in the shortest possible time, it gives them the desire to possess.But this omega is his and must only be possessed by him.At this moment, there was a knock on the door, Shen Dai failed to get up in time, and he was still embraced by Qu Moyu.Uncle Heng came back with the tie: \u201cMaster, is this it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShen Dai glanced at the tie and looked away.Uncle Heng left his tie and took the dinner plate.Only then did Qu Moyu get up and put on his clothes. When it was his turn to tie, he glanced at Shen Dai who was sitting in front of the computer with his back to him. A hint of amusement flashes in his eyes, he said, \u201cAh Dai, come and help me put on the tie.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s body froze for a moment. He slowly got up, walked to Qu Moyu, and took the tie in his hand.Qu Moyu looked at them in the mirror and watched Shen Dai carefully tying a tie for him: \u201cXiaoyue said that this tie was bought with the first money he earned.\u201dShen Dai remained silent.Qu Moyu sneered: \u201cDo you believe it? He obviously likes Qu Chengchen, but he also likes to flirt with me, which is very interesting.\u201d\u201cThen do you like him?\u201d Shen Dai blurted out.After he finished speaking, he regretted it so much that he wished he could put every word back into his stomach.\u201cI like him. I\u2019ve always wanted to marry him.\u201d Qu Moyu said calmly, \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other since we were young, and he\u2019s likely to give birth to an S-class alpha for me. It\u2019s such a pity.\u201d\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.04.13\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s Note: I don\u2019t think Qu Moyu likes You Baiyue with a passion. I think by this time, Qu Moyu had already fallen for Shen Dai but he didn\u2019t understand it yet. I think he is emotionally underdeveloped. Haha.\u2018Green Tea\u2019 is an internet slang in China for people (normally women) who \u201cappears angelically innocent, harmless and pure, while she is anything but that: she is ambitious and would sell her soul for money\u201d (From:\u00a0https://www.whatsonweibo.com/).I hate that Shen Dai feels inferior when he is with Qu Moyu because of his gender. Many people do sometimes feel inferior surrounded by people better by them but it should not be like that with the person that you like. I feel bad for him. It hurts most when people you have feelings for make you feel inferior about yourself. Shen Dai, to me, is a very strong character despite of his hardships and I have respect for people like this. Gender discrimination is everywhere even in a world where they say that every gender is equal. And yo\u2026 even men are also being discriminated against, not only women. If not, why is it that this topic is still under debate until now? -K\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Oh my goodness what a long rant!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 23": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShen Dai felt a sharp pain like he was pricked by a thorn. But he didn\u2019t even show it. He pretended like nothing had happened and continued to tie Qu Moyu\u2019s tie.Qu Moyu looked in the mirror and straightened his clothes: \u201cTake a good rest in the morning. You can ask the driver to take you to the company after lunch.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dQu Moyu stroked Shen Dai\u2019s hair: \u201cI will take you on a vacation at the end of the year. Is there any place you want to go?\u201dShen Dai shook his head: \u201cThe teacher wants me to go to South Africa when I have time to inspect a new mine, which may help with my thesis.\u201d\u201cMy employees work so hard. I, as the boss, should feel relieved.\u201d Qu Moyu lowered his head, kissed Shen Dai\u2019s glands lightly, and inhaled the smell of the white flower from the smooth skin on the back of Shen Dai\u2019s neck. The smell made him relaxed and happy. \u201cBut I want you to accompany me more.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2026\u2026\u201dQu Moyu smiled and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk more about it at the end of the year.\u201dQu Moyu walked to the door and Shen Dai got himself ready to go back to work. Today, his back was sore so he couldn\u2019t ride a bike. He will have to take a taxi\u2014 every time Qu Moyu gets out of control in bed, he will have a hard time the next day.In the taxi, he accidentally received a friend request on WeChat, whose profile picture shows that it is You Baiyue. He doesn\u2019t know why You Baiyue added him on WeChat and he is too lazy to think about it. So he just ignores the request.In the afternoon, a phone call from an unknown number came in.Because of frequent house inspections some time ago, he received many calls from real estate agents. He usually hung up on unfamiliar calls, but the number persisted calling for the third time, so he had to answer.Before Shen Dai opened his mouth, a clear and pleasant voice came from there: \u201cHello, dear brother, why didn\u2019t you accept my request. So cold?\u201dIt\u2019s You Baiyue\u2026Shen Dai looked at the busy colleagues in the laboratory, took the phone and went to the stairwell: \u201cI thought it was an online avatar used by an imposter.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t pretend. I clearly wrote who I am. You did it on purpose.\u201dShen Dai said calmly, \u201cThere are a lot of imposters lately.\u201d\u201cWow, as an omega, you really aren\u2019t cute at all.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what\u2019s the matter? I\u2019m at work now.\u201d\u201cToday is my birthday. I\u2019m going to have a party tonight. You come and play.\u201d\u201cI have to work overtime lately. I really can\u2019t find time. I wish you a happy birthday.\u201d Shen Dai was amused by You Baiyue\u2019s watchful eyes. Just because of a surveillance video that did not have any substantive tone being released, You Baiyue was already like this. Such a big reaction demonstrates that people really care about what is going on online. What else does he want\\ to do in front of him? Of course he won\u2019t go, not only because he doesn\u2019t want to see Qu Moyu and You Baiyue wearing each other\u2019s birthday gifts. But also because he doesn\u2019t want to participate in You Baiyue\u2019s self-righteous \u2018competition\u2019.Cheng Zimei said that he doesn\u2019t have that kind of \u2018ability\u2019. And yes he does not have that kind of \u2018ability\u2019 at all. His ability lies in being able to compete with most alphas in professional competition, not in competing with most omegas for alpha\u2019s attention.He saw what happened to his biological omega father with his own eyes. He was an omega with excellent family background, appearance, and education. But he completely gave up self-construction, pinned all his hopes on love and being loved, and destroyed a good life one after another in the name of love. For the scum who plundered his sexual value, in the end, there was nothing left except for the burden of a child that \u2018should not have been born\u2019.That\u2019s a path that many omegas have voluntarily or forced to choose. But it is a path that he will never take.No matter how much he likes Qu Moyu, he won\u2019t let himself fall into a meaningless trap.You Baiyue gave a light \u2018scoff\u2019: \u201cI asked Brother Yu to bring you here, but he refused, and I didn\u2019t invite you either. Do you hate me?\u201d\u201cNo, we\u2019re just unfamiliar with one another. I believe you don\u2019t lack anything by not having a friend like me to attend anyway.\u201d\u201cBut we are not friends, we are brothers.\u201d You Baiyue sighed, \u201cThe matter of the previous generation is the matter of the previous generation. We are brothers to one another, shouldn\u2019t we establish a good relationship?\u201dShen Dai was stunned. For a moment, he felt a little soft-hearted. But he quickly woke up. If You Baiyue really needed his brother, he wouldn\u2019t just remember it now. But he really didn\u2019t need it. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary, we will become strangers again soon.\u201d \u2026after he completed the contract.You Baiyue was silent for a moment: \u201cYou accept my request first, or I will keep harassing you.\u201dShen Dai said helplessly: \u201cOkay.\u201d It seemed that Young Master You wouldn\u2019t have a good birthday without showing it off to him.Cheng Zimei scolded You Baiyue for a long time, but kept following his news, wondering which celebrities and internet celebrities he invited to his birthday party.\u201cCome on, the other prince gave him a car. This boyfriend is generous enough.\u201d Cheng Zimei quickly swiped her finger on the screen, \u201cHaha many people are scolding him, saying why he didn\u2019t show his boyfriend\u2019s gifts first.\u201dShen Dai interrupted her: \u201cIs the experimental data of p203 completed yet?\u201dCheng Zimei shook her head smugly: \u201cOf course it\u2019s completed, I\u2019m just having fun while I\u2019m resting.\u201dShen Dai couldn\u2019t help but bother her: \u201cOur junior sister just said that there seems to be a problem with the filter press. Go and check it out for her.\u201dCheng Zimei gave a \u2018hmm\u2019. She then got up and left with a dissatisfied look on her face.Shen Dai was burying his head writing the materials he had when he suddenly caught sight of a shadow out of the corner of his eye. When he looked up, it was Zhou Lan.\u201cSenior Brother Shen.\u201d Zhou Lan said with a smile, \u201cI have finished all the work you gave me. I\u2019m waiting for your response.\u201d\u201cOkay, thank you. I\u2019ll get back to you later. I need to get some materials first.\u201d After Shen Dai finished speaking, seeing that Zhou Lan didn\u2019t mean to leave, he had a vague suspicion in his heart.\u201cSenior Brother Shen\u2026\u201d Zhou Lan was a little shy and a little restrained, \u201cDid you know that the Ministry of Space and the University of Geosciences are holding an exhibition recently? Not only that there are many mines that we have not seen, but also meteorites being exhibited. My friend has internal tickets where we can go earlier than scheduled to avoid crowds. I think Senior Brother Shen should be interested.\u201dShen Dai paused: \u201cRecently? I\u2019m sorry, you also know that I\u2019m stuck with my thesis at the moment and I may not have the time.\u201d\u201cIf you are stuck, it might be more inspirational to go to see the exhibition.\u201d Zhou Lan\u2019s eyes were bright, with unconcealed expectations, he explained, \u201cI have several tickets, and I want to invite Senior Brother Shen. We can also go with Senior Sister Cheng, Xiaoyang and the others. Is this Saturday okay?\u201dShen Dai breathed a sigh of relief: \u201cOkay, then it sounds good. You can arrange it and then choose a place to eat nearby. It\u2019s been a long time since our laboratory had dinner together.\u201d The teacher handed the laboratory to him, but he was not good at management. He often forgets to maintain human relations, which is also not good.When he got home in the evening, he saw that You Baiyue had added several posts on his WeChat \u2018Moments\u2019. Today is his 24th birthday. It was a grand event. There are many familiar celebrities in the group photo. The gifts are piled up like a hill.There is a photo of You Baiyue standing between Qu Moyu and Qu Chengchen, holding one\u2019s arm in one of their hands, smiling like a flower. The two S-class alphas looked even more handsome. This photo can undoubtedly cause enough heated topics. You Baiyue knows how to use his resources to maximise his advantages.And the Qu family brothers are also willing to cooperate with him. How can this kind of favour be obtained by ordinary people?Shen Dai swiped his finger upwards and flipped through the content of You Baiyue\u2019s Moments. He was completely a carefree little princess who had only luxury and pleasure in his life. Meanwhile, Shen Dai\u2019s own circle of friends are almost all from reposted industry and academic-related content, which is as dull as ever.It is not surprising that Qu Moyu would like You Baiyue. Love is mutual attraction. Marriage is value matching. And You Baiyue has everything that meets Qu Moyu\u2019s requirements for a proper wife.Shen Dai threw his handphone aside, not knowing how to feel.At this time, he heard the sound of a car. It was Qu Moyu. It was Qu Moyu who had come back after attending You Baiyue\u2019s birthday banquet. He must still have that tie around his neck. He is very familiar with the sound of the engine of this Phantom. He, who has never paid attention to the car before, can actually distinguish the car by sound only, just because he had listened to it too many times. It is almost like Pavlov\u2019s bell. Once the eardrum is triggered, no matter what he was doing at the time, he would run to the window, tore a slit in the curtain, and took a peek.At this moment, he also sat up from the bed, but he didn\u2019t walk to the window reflexively, He just turned off his light decisively.For the first time, he didn\u2019t want to peek a look at Qu Moyu.On Saturday, a group of people from the laboratory visited the astronomy and geology exhibition together. In fact, there are not many people who will want to see this kind of exhibition. Only them, the people who studied their fields, will feel that the stones that look like a mess have an indescribable charm.Zhou Lan\u2019s attentiveness towards Shen Dai was obvious. Everyone could see it, but because of Shen Dai\u2019s identity, they didn\u2019t dare to push him towards Shen Dai.Cheng Zimei was also happy to see it happen, and deliberately set everyone away, trying to keep the two of them alone.Shen Dai was looking at a display and when he turned around, he found that only him and Zhou Lan were left. Zhou Lan handed a mineral water bottle that had been unscrewed to Shen Dai: \u201cBrother, drink some water, are you tired? Do you want to take a break?\u201dShen Dai knew that it was impossible to rely on Cheng Zimei to help him to block this guy. He looked at the young and healthy boy in front of him and was worried. He said, \u201cI\u2019m not tired. Where are the others?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe they\u2019ve gone to the toilet.\u201d Zhou Lan looked very happy. \u201cSenior brother, look. This commentary is not so eloquent. Is it a literal translation from English? It\u2019s too careless.\u201dShen Dai also leaned over to read the commentary, the font was a bit small so their heads almost touched one another.When the tip of his hair touched the other\u2019s tip of the hair, they could smell each other\u2019s pheromones. Although Zhou Lan couldn\u2019t tell what the exact smell was, he could smell the warm and pleasant smell of Shen Dai\u2019s pheromone. Shen Dai quickly took a step back. Zhou Lan was also startled but his expression revealed a little bit of joy.Zhou Lan asked shyly, \u201cWhat is that smell? The smell of Senior Brother Shen\u2019s pheromone is light, but it smells good.\u201dShen Dai said blankly, \u201cI\u2019m going to the toilet.\u201d\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.04.14\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s Note: I switched all \u2018SCI\u2019 to thesis for easier understanding.Pavlov\u2019s bell is a conditioning experiment. I learnt about it in Psychology class before. In the experiment, a bell is rung to signal food is being served to a dog. This is repeated over and over. Until even when there\u2019s no food, even hearing the sound of the bell will make the dog associate it to food and will salivate.I\u2019m afraid if Qu Moyu is the next Shao Qun (from \u2018Sissy\u2019). Sigh\u2026 I don\u2019t even know why I like reading all this dog-blood so much T.T!\u201cNo matter how much he likes Qu Moyu, he won\u2019t let himself fall into a meaningless trap\u201d\u2026 Sad to say, he will fall into such a trap. -KPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 24": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter watching the exhibition, the group had a dinner party until after eleven o\u2019clock in the evening and chatted happily.Only Zhou Lan was worried that he had made Shen Dai unhappy and felt a little constrained all night.When an alpha and omega talk about each other\u2019s pheromones, unless they are acquaintances joking with one another, the situation is somewhat ambiguous and provocative. If the statuses of Shen Dai and Zhou Lan are exchanged today, if it is an alpha superior who said this to an omega subordinate, it could be filed as sexual harassment. Zhou Lan was tempted for a moment back then and wanted so much to break through the relationship. In short, he was being a bit rash. What\u2019s even more embarrassing is that he couldn\u2019t help releasing a little pheromone at the time. When he noticed it, he immediately controlled it, but he didn\u2019t know if Shen Dai had already noticed it.Anyway, Shen Dai made an excuse to go to the bathroom. But when he came back, he obviously had been avoiding him, which made Zhou Lan feel very frustrated.After the group broke up, Shen Dai saw that it was too late and it was too far to go back to his grandmother\u2019s place, so he planned to go back to Qu\u2019s house first.Zhou Lan hesitated again and again but he still got close to Shen Dai, and asked cautiously, \u201cSenior Brother Shen, can I take you home?\u201d\u201cNo need. I\u2019ve already called a taxi.\u201d Seeing his uneasy look, Shen Dai couldn\u2019t bear it anymore and said, \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cThen be careful on your way home.\u201d\u201cOkay, so are you.\u201dShen Dai got into the car and felt a little more relaxed. He regrets today\u2019s itinerary a little bit. Although the team needs group activities and the exhibition was a good event, it is not as easy for him to go through the materials at home.On the way home, he received a WeChat message from Zhou Lan. He asked him if he was angry. He thought for a moment and replied:\u00a0No. Don\u2019t think too much.\u2018Don\u2019t think too much\u2019. He hopes that Zhou Lan can understand what he really means by this word and really stop thinking further about him.When he reached Qu\u2019s house, the lights in the living room were still on. He entered through the door. It turned out that Qu Moyu had also just returned. He was probably hungry. Aunt Lan had cooked a bowl of noodles for him and was watching him eat.Shen Dai didn\u2019t expect to bump into Qu Moyu. He subconsciously looked at his neckline. Of course he had changed a tie today, but the haze in his heart could not be eliminated for a while.Qu Moyu was also surprised to see Shen Dai: \u201cDidn\u2019t you go see your grandma today?\u201d\u201cI went to see an exhibition, then had dinner with my colleagues, and it was already too late to go back there.\u201d\u201cCome and sit.\u201d Qu Moyu asked casually, \u201cWhat exhibition did you go and see?\u201dShen Dai came over: \u201cIt\u2019s an astronomical and geological exhibition organised by the Ministry of Space and the University of Geosciences.\u201dAunt Lan asked Shen Dai with a smile: \u201cAh Dai, are you hungry? I\u2019ll cook you a bowl of noodles too. The beef bone soup that has been boiled for a day is delicious.\u201d\u201cAunt Lan, no need. I\u2019m already very full.\u201dAs soon as Shen Dai sat down, Qu Moyu wrinkled his nose. He put down his chopsticks and leaned in the direction of Shen Dai inadvertently: \u201cDoes the exhibition look good?\u201d\u201cIt certainly won\u2019t be as interesting as a commercial show. People who aren\u2019t interested will just see a pile of dirt and rocks.\u201dQu Moyu smelled other alpha pheromones on Shen Dai and he asked calmly, \u201cReally? Who did you go with?\u201d\u201cColleague.\u201dThe smell of a single alpha pheromone on an omega coming back from a public place is something suspicious enough. When everyone is wearing pheromone stickers, as long as they don\u2019t have very close contact, or deliberately releasing pheromones, it is difficult for the smell to stay on another for too long.As an S-class alpha, Qu Moyu\u2019s ability to perceive pheromones is very strong. Usually, everyone will have a little messy pheromone smell after a day, such as crowding the subway, taking the elevator, and such. It may leave some ambient odour. However, now there is a single, prominent, and obvious alpha pheromone on him which means that Shen Dai has been in contact with a certain alpha for a long enough time and a close enough contact today. And also, that certain alpha even has released a purposeful pheromone towards Shen Dai.Meanwhile, Shen Dai himself has his own pheromone that smells very light, so his perception ability is not that strong. He didn\u2019t notice the pheromone released by Zhou Lan.Qu Moyu is unhappy. It is very common to accidentally get a little bit of other people\u2019s pheromones in social interactions for various reasons. He commanded: \u201cGo take a bath.\u201dFor Shen Dai, the words \u2018go to take a bath\u2019 are the prompt words for sex. He wants to go home early tomorrow morning. If Qu Moyu fucked him all night, how could he get up in the morning?Moreover, when he looks at Qu Moyu, he is reminded of You Baiyue\u2019s delicate and beautiful face, and the superior life that normal mortals could not achieve. He did not want to simply call the blockage in his heart as \u2018inferiority\u2019. But he still couldn\u2019t control himself to think that Qu Moyu couldn\u2019t eat the high-end dish he \u2018liked\u2019, so he could just take a bite of a lighter meal. Just like this bowl of noodles on the table. It\u2019s impossible to eat a big meal so late, and it\u2019s simple and convenient to get something nearby to pad his stomach.That\u2019s what he is to Qu Moyu. A convenient meal.He should be able to calmly accept this deal. After all, 10 million is very expensive and worth it. But he is restless, he is also tempted, and he brought it to himself.Shen Dai\u2019s brief hesitation was seen by Qu Moyu, his pupils became darker. It added more to his displeasure: \u201cWhat?\u201d Hesitation can be interpreted as resistance by him, whether Shen Dai did it intentionally or unintentionally. Shen Dai probably didn\u2019t want to have sex with him. He is also covered in the smell of other alphas. This is making Qu Moyu really angry.Emotional management is a required course for S-class alphas because their emotional problems can lead to serious personal injury so the sword must be sheathed. So he rarely gets really angry and will only release coercion purposefully depending on the situation. But at this moment, he is really angry because his omega is rejecting him.This makes the dignity of the S-class alpha intolerable.Shen Dai lowered his head: \u201cI\u2019m going to take a bath.\u201d He got up and went upstairs.When Qu Moyu came to Shen Dai\u2019s room, his emotions had completely calmed down, especially when he saw Shen Dai obediently lying under the quilt waiting for him, and a trace of tension flashed in his eyes when he met the other\u2019s eyes.He got into the quilt, Shen Dai hesitated for a moment, and took the initiative to hug him \u2013 just as he had asked.Qu Moyu lowered his head and quietly sniffed Shen Dai as if he was patrolling his territory. From the fluffy hair, rosy cheeks to the back of the fair neck, he confirmed that Shen Dai had completely washed off all the messy odours. There was only the fragrance of shampoo on his body and the smell of the faint pheromone. He showed a satisfied expression. He put Shen Dai in his arms and wrapped his arms around him firmly. He is not in a hurry to take possession, but he still dropped a few small kisses on him.Shen Dai put himself close to Qu Moyu\u2019s generous and warm chest, the powerful sense of power from the S-class alpha made his emotions of being attached unstoppable, he whispered: \u201cMoyu, I want to get up early tomorrow. I want to go back to Grandma\u2019s house early.\u201d\u201cHmm, okay.\u201d\u201cSo, can you\u2026\u201d\u201cCan I\u2026 what?\u201dShen Dai said embarrassedly, \u201cCan you only do it once?\u201d Omegas only have strong sexual desire and abundant physical strength when they are in estrus. Without such abnormal hormones, he would not be able to completely satisfy Qu Moyu.Qu Moyu chuckled twice: \u201cWho said that I wanted to have sex? Do you want to?\u201dShen Dai froze awkwardly.\u201cDo you really want to do it?\u201d Qu Moyu hit Shen Dai\u2019s nose with the tip of his nose, \u201cDid you wash yourself clean and wait for me?\u201dOnly then did Shen Dai realise that Qu Moyu was teasing him. In response, he is embarrassed: \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d He struggled to get away from Qu Moyu\u2019s arms, but was held firmly to death by Qu Moyu.Qu Moyu looked at him, his brows were curved, his eyes were smiling, so beautiful that he almost forgot to catch his own heartbeat. The pheromone entangled into an ambiguous atmosphere lingering between the two of them.Shen Dai sighed in his heart, such a person, such a person full of halo, full of charm, so powerful that he seems to be omnipotent, someone who has saved himself time and time again, how can he not fall for him?\u201cOkay.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s big hand stroked Shen Dai\u2019s hair. They then moved down slightly, and his warm palm was pressed to Shen Dai\u2019s glands. \u201cI won\u2019t do it tonight. I\u2019ll let you go to bed and get up early, okay?\u201d He didn\u2019t think that way before walking into this room. Of course, he came to Shen Dai just to solve his physiological needs. But when they were curled up in a warm bed, their bodies were against one another, their eyes collided inadvertently, and the pheromones of ebony wood and epiphyllum were intertwined, he suddenly felt that it didn\u2019t matter whether he had sex or not. Having sex is nothing more than seeking for comfort. He already feels very comfortable now. The kind of comfort in which his body and mind are completely relaxed, roaming in warmth and peace.It was an experience he had never had before. The person in his arms is very strange. He can arouse his most violent desire and it can also make him return to peace like an ancient well.Shen Dai has no power to resist the tenderness released by Qu Moyu at this moment, and his whole heart is ecstatic. Although his reason reminds him not to be self-motivated, in this brief moment, he imagines that Qu Moyu might have a little affection for him. People have feelings after all. After the spirit and the flesh have communicated well, they will definitely leave a mark on the mind.It would be great if Qu Moyu could also have feelings for him.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.04.15\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s Note: I personally think that Qu Moyu has already liked Shen Dai but that stupid scum doesn\u2019t realise it yet. Ugh. Oh. By the way, I\u2019m using British English since it is already set like that in my word doc for school-KPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 25": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShen Dai went home to have lunch with his grandmother. He then took her to see the newly bought house in the afternoon.He hired a company to make a simple renovation to the house, which is expected to be completed in another half of a month. When the two went there, the workers were working on the renovation. He took his grandma to see the three-bedroom apartment several times. The two discussed how to arrange and decorate here and there. He also bought a lot of decorations for the house and waited for them to be delivered. Once his grandmother is discharged from the hospital after surgery, she can go back to a cosy home.His grandmother is very happy. There is a rosy complexion on her face. There is nothing more motivating than planning for the future. Shen Dai hopes that his grandmother will have the courage to face the surgery, because a better life is waiting for them.After seeing the exhibition, Zhou Lan saw Shen Dai\u2019s deliberate alienation of him. So he did not dare to be too attentive, but as long as he found an opportunity to bring food to Shen Dai, he would be the first to rush to do it. Originally, it was common for junior brothers and sisters to bring meals to senior brothers and sisters. It was usually not just one person who would do so. Shen Dai also had no reason to object.He always hoped that there would be an opportunity to clarify his rejection of Zhou Lan. But Zhou Lan never made his intention directly clear. He just approached him silently and tried to be nice to him. It is not easy to hide his feelings.Cheng Zimei persuaded him several times to try to get along with Zhou Lan. But he had to pretend that he was about to be angry, which stopped Cheng Zimei from trying to match them together.Shen Dai\u2019s attention has not been on this recently. He has too many things to do, decorating his new house, working on his thesis, and learning how to take care of patients after surgery. Gastric cancer patients have a lot of rules about diet. An hourly worker can be hired, but he has to master first of what his grandmother can and cannot eat.His grandmother\u2019s surgery period is approaching, and he also becomes somewhat nervous. At this time of infinite anxiety, he received a phone call that he didn\u2019t want to receive.It was an ordinary day. On his way home from work, he received a call from an unfamiliar number on his mobile phone. After the call was connected, there was three seconds of silence before the person on the other end cautiously said \u201chello\u201d.Shen Dai was immediately stunned. His heart trembled slightly. He thought that the voice sounded familiar.\u201cAh Dai? I\u2026 I\u2019m your father.\u201d The voice on the phone was very gentle and pleasant. Such a voice would make people unable to help but have beautiful thoughts about the other person, which was extremely deceptive.This voice only made Shen Dai feel like falling into an ice cave, and he was chilled down to the bone.\u201cAh Dai, I\u2026\u201dShen Dai immediately hung up the phone. But the other person called in again soon. He wanted to block the number, but then he thought about the cost of being harassed by him through the usage of new numbers. So, it is unavoidable. He answered the call again.\u201cAh Dai, I\u2019ll just say a few words to you. Don\u2019t do this to your father.\u201d The voice was a little choked with grievances, and it sounded really pitiful.Shen Dai asked indifferently, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cI miss your grandmother very much. I heard that she is going to have an operation. I miss you too. I really\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you try to come back.\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s voice was empty and without emotions, \u201cWe are living well now. If you still have a little conscience, don\u2019t come back and destroy our hard-earned peace.\u201d\u201cAh Dai.\u201d The other end sobbed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I made so many mistakes. And I feel ashamed to see you. But I really miss you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t come back.\u201d Shen Dai was unmoved and said firmly, \u201cIf you really still have feelings for us, then don\u2019t come back.\u201dShen Dai hung up the phone again. Standing at the subway entrance where people come and go, in the chaos and noise of the world, he feels an indescribable helplessness.People cannot choose their own parents. But now he is an adult so he can choose to stay away from them.It\u2019s just that he has an ominous bad feeling in his heart. The reason why selfish people are selfish is because they only consider their own feelings. He is afraid that sooner or later he will have to face the father who is already dead in his heart.Whenever he feels hesitant and at a loss, Shen Dai always thinks of Qu Moyu. He knows that his dependence on Qu Moyu is very dangerous, because Qu Moyu is obviously not his alpha. But liking someone and being dependent on someone are human natures. Even if the heart has been flooded with disaster that is yet to come, it is unavoidable.Shen Dai unlocked his phone, clicked on Qu Moyu\u2019s WeChat avatar, pressed his trembling fingers against the dialog box, and looked at the soft keyboard but didn\u2019t know what to say. He really just wanted a response, anything at all.But what to say?Even if they didn\u2019t do anything that day. They only slept sweetly hugging each other, and woke up in the morning snuggling with each other. They seemed to have been a little closer. But when they put on clothes and walked out of that room, they seemed to go back to being strangers.Shen Dai hesitated again and again. In the end, he only forwarded an academic report from the work group to Qu Moyu and said:\u00a0This is regarding the question you asked me the other day. This report also has relevant explanations and it provides some domestic and international data comparisons of production capacity.After a while, Qu Moyu replied to him:\u00a0Okay.Shen Dai stared at the word for a long time, then summoned up the courage to ask:\u00a0Are you off work?There was a quick reply:\u00a0On my way home.Shen Dai couldn\u2019t describe the mood at that moment. It was like rain falling down on a land of long drought. Such a sudden joy. This conversation is ordinary and brief, but full of life-like flavours. The two seem to have known each other for a long time, and they care about each other in daily details. For him, this is far more emotional than associating skin-to-skin.Shen Dai replied:\u00a0Me too.He didn\u2019t think Qu Moyu would reply again, so he quickened his pace to return home.At the same time, Qu Moyu was sitting in the car looking at his phone. The page was the WeChat dialog box with Shen Dai. Shen Dai\u2019s avatar is a Chinese ink painting of a mountain. Qu Moyu guessed that this should be Mount Tai painted by his grandfather. From the limited pixels, thousands of valleys and thousands of rocks floating in the colours of red and green can still be seen. This mountain is well drawn by a talented artist. But it\u2019s hard to imagine that this is the WeChat profile picture of a young omega.Qu Moyu thought of Shen Dai from his avatar. Suddenly, he wanted to laugh. But he also had some subtle desire to explore. He clicked into Shen Dai\u2019s circle of friends. He found that most of his \u2018moments\u2019 were almost all reposts of various academic and industry-related articles. He scrolled down for a long time but found no personal content. The only personal photo was taken when he attended an academic summit with Professor Liu. Shen Dai\u2019s face was deformed by the camera, which didn\u2019t look good.For Qu Moyu, Shen Dai is a type of omega that he has never been in contact with before. From his appearance to his name to his job and even to his personality, in general, he is the omega that is the least like an omega he has ever seen. There are many omegas that shine, but very few are engaged in scientific research work in science and engineering. People like Shen Dai who are good-looking but don\u2019t make a statement or take advantage of this advantage are even rarer. Shen Dai seems to be deliberately trying to blur his own gender.What an outlier, Qu Moyu thought to himself. But when he was on the bed, when he was in his arms, he could clearly be charming and only he had seen him like that.The corners of Qu Moyu\u2019s mouth raised slightly.\u201cYoung Master, Uncle Heng asked you if you want anything for dinner.\u201dLao Wu\u2019s voice interrupted Qu Moyu\u2019s thoughts. He usually socialises a lot. So, every time he wants to go home for dinner, his driver will notify Uncle Heng in advance.\u201cWhatever is fine.\u201d Qu Moyu looked out the window, \u201cThe traffic is bad.\u201d\u201cYeah, there might be a car accident ahead.\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s eyes randomly landed on a large LED billboard on the street. An advertisement for an astronomical and geological exhibition was placed on it. Qu Moyu remembered that Shen Dai had been to this exhibition. The screen switches to a host interviewing the audience at the exhibition. The two occupy one-third of the frame, but in the distant view, a familiar figure can be seen.Qu Moyu slowly lowered the car window and watched intently. Although he only saw the back and the side view, he can still determine that the person watching the exhibition in the distant view was Shen Dai. And beside Shen Dai stood a tall and upright young man. Most probably be an alpha from his physical appearance. The man handed Shen Dai a bottle of water and talked a few words with him. The two of them bent down to read the writings on the exhibit together. They were very close and it looked as if their heads were almost overlapping with each other, making them seem to be very intimate.\u201cStop.\u201d Qu Moyu ordered coldly.\u201cWhat?\u201d The car was moving slowly following the traffic.\u201cStop.\u201dLao Wu hurriedly stepped on the brakes and a dissatisfied honk sounded immediately behind him. He looked back at Qu Moyu and found that Qu Moyu was staring intently at a billboard. He had to press the double flash to indicate emergency stop.Early the next morning, not long after Shen Dai arrived at the laboratory, he was informed that a leader was coming in for inspection in the afternoon.It may be because it is almost the end of the year. Recently, various partners have come to visit, or they have to send people to inspect. Although he is used to it, he is still very dissatisfied. They are already busy enough, and he really does not want to receive wave after wave of people. He had to introduce the same thing and answer the same question, but despite his dissatisfaction, work still has to be done. But then, the executive told him that the CEO would also come.Shen Dai was instantly refreshed, and he was very happy to show Qu Moyu what he looked like at work. This is probably a compensatory mentality, wanting to pull the person who is too powerful for him into his own field, showing his ability and self-confidence, in order to seek a little balance in his dignity.Yesterday he got home first and went back to his room to write his thesis after dinner. In fact, he was a little disappointed. He deliberately procrastinated his dinner, hoping to meet Qu Moyu. Naturally, it was simply because of the content of their previous WeChat conversation. But having already returned to the room, it would seem deliberate to come down just to talk to him again.But Qu Moyu will come to his lab soon, and the conversation here makes him more comfortable and more confident. Although he repeatedly warned himself to be sober and rational, he still instinctively wanted Qu Moyu to see his brilliance. He wanted him to see the achievements of his unremitting efforts. And he eagerly wanted the person he likes to \u2018see\u2019 his real value, not only his value as a bed partner.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.04.18\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s rant: Shen Dai, you\u2019re going to be disappointed. Anyone, please give me a pair of sandals so I can throw them on Qu Moyu\u2019s head before the next chapter. Oh but Shen Qin (Shen Dai\u2019s omega father) also deserves to be slapped by my sandals. You will know why soon. I hate this guy with a passion. -KPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He tugged at the end of his hair. His hair was a little longer and he didn\u2019t have time to cut it recently. He dipped it in water, and pulled the bangs behind his head as much as possible. The person in the mirror looked straight and capable, and he was quite satisfied.They waited until they were about to get off work before Qu Moyu brought some executives to the laboratory.\u201cHello, Mr. Qu and all leaders.\u201d Shen Dai said respectfully, \u201cWe welcome you to inspect.\u201dAn executive pointed at Shen Dai and said with a smile: \u201cYou are Shen Gong who gave the speech that day. I am very impressed with you. You spoke very well.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cThe most profound thing is that you are actually an omega.

It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\u201cI remember on that day, Mr. Qu deliberately defended you.\u201d Another older director said, \u201cMr. Qu, this man is such a young and promising researcher, it\u2019s no wonder you would cherish his talents.\u201dShen Dai smiled implicitly and at the same time secretly glanced at Qu Moyu.With a faint smile on his face, Qu Moyu nodded and said yes. But when he looked at Shen Dai, it was like he was looking at a stranger.Cheng Zimei said: \u201cLeaders, please come in. Let\u2019s go to the conference room to see the latest project information.\u201dA group of people took their seats in the conference room. Shen Dai opened the prepared information sheet on the projector and explained to them. Qu Moyu put his arms around his chest and leaned back in the chair, seemingly looking at the projection wall, but in fact the focus of his vision was on Shen Dai. The pure white lab coat on Shen Dai\u2019s body made his face look even more fair and handsome. But the wide and shapeless design of the lab coat seemed to cast a mysterious sense of wrapping. It made people feel like they wanted to use their hands to unwrap the clothes in order to measure how thin his waist is and to see how his backside looks like.Qu Moyu couldn\u2019t help but to imagine Shen Dai being naked, wearing only a lab coat. His hands could directly touch the warm and smooth skin through. It should be very interesting.At this time, two interns came in to help pour tea and water.Zhou Lan was the first to walk to Qu Moyu\u2019s side. In order not to disturb the leader\u2019s thoughts, he hunched over to minimise his presence. He quietly placed the freshly brewed tea in front of Qu Moyu.Qu Moyu\u2019s fantasy came to an abrupt end the moment Zhou Lan approached. His sensitive sense of smell caught a familiar alpha pheromone. It is the smell that once lingered on Shen Dai. Qu Moyu turned his face and saw a tall and heroic young alpha with a good body, hairstyle, and pheromone smell. He was certain that this alpha was the one who watched the exhibition closely with Shen Dai that day and left his pheromones on his body. .Zhou Lan was startled by Qu Moyu\u2019s sudden sharp turn. When his eyes collided, he sensed the chill that made his heart tremble in the eyes of this S-class alpha and even felt a little bit of hostility coming from him.Zhou Lan quickly apologised in a low voice, although he didn\u2019t know what he had done wrong.Qu Moyu turned his face away without saying a word. He suddenly decided to investigate what happened during the exhibition, just to see if the \u2018colleague\u2019 Shen Dai said was really just a colleague. At this moment, he should be glad that Shen Dai didn\u2019t lie to him. But he is also annoyed that Shen Dai was alone with an alpha for so long that they were even infected with each other\u2019s pheromones.Zhou Lan put down the teacup in front of the executives in turn, but when he walked around the round table to Shen Dai, he suddenly took out a black thermos cup from the big pocket of his lab coat. It was Shen Dai\u2019s thermos cup. Zhou Lan put it down and smiled at Shen Dai, who also nodded at him.Qu Moyu narrowed his eyes. He can now be sure that this alpha is interested in Shen Dai. And for sure, that day,he deliberately released his pheromones to Shen Dai. Shen Dai is supposed to be so smart, did he even notice it? If so, why not avoid any suspicion? He even dared to return to his home with the smell of other alphas on him?!Qu Moyu picked up the phone with a sullen face and asked his assistant to send him information regarding the personnels in the institute.After demonstrating the project information, Shen Dai asked everyone if they had any questions as usual. Next, it was time to take them to the laboratory for a tour. This process has been done many times recently.Qu Moyu pointed at the table with his finger, and everyone looked at him sideways. He said indifferently, \u201cShen Gong, when was this presentation made?\u201d\u201cAbout half a year ago.\u201d\u201cSix months ago, it was equal to what you showed customers and management, and many of the contents were not updated.\u201dShen Dai was stunned for a moment: \u201cThis is an introduction, I will go into more details when we visit the laboratory\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you still remember your own speech?\u201d Qu Moyu interrupted him unceremoniously, with a grim expression, \u201cYou were asked by Qu Chengchen several questions and you almost couldn\u2019t get off the stage. Although the speech was mainly just a form of formality, you should not take it easy. This year\u2019s budget may not affect many shareholders and investors. But next year, and in the future, will Qu Chengchen\u2019s question become their question instead? Have you considered these questions? Some of the content in this expansion happened to be the ones that Qu Chengchen found fault with, why not deal with it?\u201dAll eyes fell on Shen Dai, and Shen Dai felt that he had been put on a high platform again \u2013 by the person who had slept with him a few days ago and said good morning and night to each other.The atmosphere in the conference room became a little tense. Anyone with a discerning eye can see that Qu Moyu\u2019s behaviour is intentionally nit-picking. A profile video for laymen is simply not worth investing too much time in updating constantly.Shen Dai clenched the laser pointer, and Qu Moyu, who was sitting across from the long round table, was restrained and coercive. The dark three-piece suit was his armour, his emotionless eyes and words were his swords, and he was a fully armed man. He looks superior, and also unfamiliar to Shen Dai.How can someone be sometimes tender and sweet? But also sometimes cold and indifferent? Shen Dai guessed that Qu Moyu did this in order to place a distance between them. Through harsh and ruthless treatment, the scandal raised by the surveillance video would be turned to dust. After all, which S-class alpha would be willing to be rumoured with an ordinary omega?In this way, it can explain why Qu Moyu made this extra trip today. Shen Dai thinks that it\u2019s ridiculous of himself to be full of expectations and wants to show off in front of his sweetheart.It is simply embarrassing.Shen Dai\u2019s self-confidence withered instantly. He endured the sadness and forced a smile: \u201cMr. Qu, you are right. We will rectify it immediately.\u201dFor the next visit, Shen Dai intentionally made an international long-distance appointment with the teacher and asked Cheng Zimei to explain the rest on his behalf. He went back to his office alone to sort out his own emotions.About half an hour later, there was a knock on the door. Shen Dai recovered from his daze: \u201cPlease come in.\u201dWhen he saw that the person pushing the door was Qu Moyu, Shen Dai immediately stood up from his chair.Qu Moyu brought himself to the door and quickly swiped a look at Shen Dai\u2019s office, which was full of books, materials and specimens, as well as rows of awards and trophies.Shen Dai silently stood aside, waiting for Qu Moyu to say something.Qu Moyu walked up to him, raised his hand to lift his chin, and smiled casually: \u201cWhy? Are you upset?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Shen Dai took a step back subconsciously.Qu Moyu followed and still took a step forward. He suddenly clasped Shen Dai\u2019s shoulders against the wall. He then kissed him forcefully, blocking Shen Dai\u2019s protest in his mouth. He rudely crushed his lips, teasing him with his tongue, almost causing him to run out of breath.Shen Dai felt Qu Moyu\u2019s anger. He didn\u2019t know where the anger came from. He was kissed until he couldn\u2019t breathe, but he still didn\u2019t forget that this was the office. So he kept pushing Qu Moyu\u2019s chest off of him. Qu Moyu\u2019s big hands took and clamped both of his wrists and pressed them against his chest. His knees got stuck between Shen Dai\u2019s legs, making his limbs unable to move.The ebony pheromone escaped and surrounded Shen Dai layer by layer. Once Shen Dai\u2019s body received such a powerful alpha pheromone, he would no longer have the ability to resist. As long as the S-class alpha willed him, he could be in heat on the spot, kneeling on the ground begging to be fucked. This is the sad case with omega\u2019s gene.The replaceable air became thinner and thinner. Shen Dai\u2019s brain lacked oxygen. He had to rely on Qu Moyu\u2019s breath to maintain his basic life energy. He fell softly into Qu Moyu\u2019s arms until the S-class predator stopped his plundering.Qu Moyu hugged him, sat on the sofa beside him, fondled his swollen lips with pity, and said frivolously: \u201cHave you ever imagined being fucked in the office, \u2018Shen Gong\u2019?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026\u201d Shen Dai had tears in his eyes and his voice trembled, \u201cPlease.\u201dThis is his office. His laboratory. It is where he works and studies. It witnesses and carries his career, his achievements and his dreams. This is where he is a capable, learned, and respected man. Here, he is the researcher, not a toy or a slut.It was only at this moment that he realised that he was too naive. No matter the time or place, there will always be a gap between him and Qu Moyu. He was worthless in his eyes. Qu Moyu\u2019s uncertain, occasional tenderness was just a means of flirting. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. Only he himself wanted to be extravagant. But his identity and status remained the same \u2013 he is just a convenient bed partner.At this moment, there\u2019s a knock at the door. Shen Dai was so shocked that he wanted to get off of Qu Moyu, but Qu Moyu grabbed hold of his waist tightly and simply responded, \u201cCome in.\u201dQu Moyu grasped the timing very cleverly. At the same time that Zhou Lan pushed the door and entered, he let go of his hand, letting Shen Dai get up in a daze, and staggered two steps because of the unstable landing.Zhou Lan\u2019s eyes happened to capture this scene. Even if he didn\u2019t see the whole thing, Shen Dai\u2019s loose clothes, messy hair, wet eye end and red swollen lips were not enough to explain everything. What\u2019s more, Shen Dai\u2019s whole body is covered in Qu Moyu\u2019s alpha pheromone.The tea in Zhou Lan\u2019s hand almost fell to the ground. He was stunned at the door, his mind blank.\u201cPut it here.\u201d Qu Moyu tapped the coffee table in front of him with his fingers and ordered, \u201cClose the door.\u201dZhou Lan came back to his senses, closed the door mechanically, and put the tray on the coffee table.Qu Moyu smiled at Zhou Lan, \u201cAre you a new intern? What\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cYes, Mr. Qu. My name is Zhou Lan.\u201d Zhou Lan\u2019s voice was trembling.\u201cWhen will the internship end?\u201d\u201cSoon.\u201d\u201cWill you continue?\u201d\u201c\u2026If it is possible.\u201d Zhou Lan vaguely guessed the reason for the seemingly non-existent hostility that Qu Moyu released before. His chest was so suffocated that it was hard to breathe, and Qu Moyu didn\u2019t even need to release pheromone to suppress him. The poor status is itself a form of repression.\u201cThose who can get an internship at the institute should be very good. Generally, they can continue without making any mistakes.\u201d Qu Moyu accentuated the pronunciation of the word \u2018mistake\u2019. He took a sip of tea and smiled as he said, \u201cI believe that under the leadership of Shen Gong, you will also create more value for the company.\u201d\u201cI will work hard.\u201d\u201cWell, what happened just now, I won\u2019t add it to your confidentiality contract. But you know what happened, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zhou Lan lowered his head, not daring to breathe.\u201cOkay, thanks for the tea. You can go out.\u201dZhou Lan lowered his head and walked out quickly. When he passed by Shen Dai, he left a sideways look displaying complicated emotions.Shen Dai stood aside, feeling as if someone had stripped his clothes off in the street. Anger, humiliation, sadness\u2026 he feels them all. He couldn\u2019t imagine that this was given by the person he likes. He couldn\u2019t imagine that the person who was perfect in his eyes would be such a scum.His restraint, his prudence, and his degree of advance and retreat are all to preserve a little dignity in this extremely unequal relationship, but Qu Moyu can easily and carelessly crush it.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.04.19\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s Rant: One word, Qu Moyu. \u2018Respect\u2019.

    "Chapter 27": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySeeing that Shen Dai\u2019s eyes were red, with his chest heaving up and down, and his tightly pursed lips seemed to block the grievances in his stomach, Qu Moyu couldn\u2019t bear it.He had investigated and found that Shen Dai was indeed visiting the exhibition with a group of colleagues. But at the time the video was taken, he was only standing with Zhou Lan. He and the other are both alphas. What was the intention of leaving pheromones on an omega on purpose? And combined with his act in front of Shen Dai today, the answer is very certain. He knew that Shen Dai didn\u2019t have the guts to do anything behind his back, but he couldn\u2019t tolerate an alpha who worked together with him every day coveting his omega.It is necessary to let the other party retreat in spite of difficulties.Qu Moyu put on a gentle look and reached out to Shen Dai: \u201cCome here. Let me have a hug.\u201dShen Dai lowered his head: \u201cYou should go out. They are waiting for you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the boss. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cIf you do this\u2026 there will be bad rumours.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Qu Moyu spread out his hands, \u201cCome here.\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s hands are very large, with slender fingers and well-defined joints. The connection of each phalanx contains a sense of strength. When the palm is up and stretched, it seems to mean invitation and acceptance. But in Shen Dai\u2019s eyes, it is clearly a sign of a trap. This is because he can easily gather his five fingers and grasp everything that falls into it, whether actively or passively.Standing in his office, Shen Dai felt isolated and helpless. This is because as far as everything that he could see, including himself, were all Qu Moyu\u2019s \u2018assets\u2019. He walked over slowly and placed his hand into Qu Moyu\u2019s palm\u2014a hand he had imagined to grasp countless times, but at this time, he couldn\u2019t feel the warmth.Qu Moyu pulled Shen Dai into his arms and squeezed his soft fair cheeks gently: \u201cYou are wronged. Angry, eh?\u201dShen Dai lowered his head and pondered for a moment: \u201cWhat on earth are you trying to do today?\u201d\u201cIf I said it was for you, would you be less angry?\u201d Qu Moyu kissed Shen Dai\u2019s face with a tone of teasing a troubled cat, \u201cYou can\u2019t see that the little boy is interested in you?\u201dShen Dai thought to himself; \u2018That little boy is only two years younger than you\u2019, and he whispered, \u201cSo what can I do about it?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t I help to make him sober?\u201d Qu Moyu smiled and said casually, \u201cWe are all adults. I don\u2019t want to restrict you. And I believe that you will abide by the contract. But this man, you get to see him every day. So try to avoid giving me doubts.\u201dThe word \u2018contract\u2019 always sounded so harsh for Shen Dai. He understood what Qu Moyu meant. Even if he was only a nominal, private wife who was going to be divorced sooner or later, he would not tolerate any promiscuous behaviour. But does Qu Moyu have to use such a humiliating way to exercise the rights of \u2018Party A\u2019?Shen Dai said blankly, \u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cCheer up.\u201d Qu Moyu pinched Shen Dai\u2019s soft cheeks again. The man looked thin, but felt soft in all the right places.\u201cIt\u2019s almost time to get off work, you\u2019d better go back first.\u201dQu Moyu can feel that Shen Dai was a little moody. It brought out a different kind of taste compared with the usual obedient him. He looked at his watch: \u201cCome with me and wait for me in the parking lot at 7:15.\u201d\u201cTonight I\u2026\u201d\u201cI want to take you out for dinner tonight.\u201d Qu Moyu stared at Shen Dai with those deep eyes, \u201cHow about going out on a date with me?\u201dShen Dai was stunned. His heart beat fiercely. But then he realised sadly that even if he was angry with Qu Moyu, he would still be moved by this little sweetness he can offer.Shen Dai deliberately spilled some alcohol on his clothes, and used the pungent smell to cover up the ebony fragrance that Qu Moyu left on his body. Only then did he dare to walk out of the laboratory and go to Qu Moyu\u2019s exclusive parking lot.Both the car and Lao Wu were already there. Shen Dai got into the car, and Lao Wu nodded to him and booked for the restaurant. After waiting for less than ten minutes, Qu Moyu came.Qu Moyu wrinkled his nose as soon as he got in the car: \u201cWhy does it smell like alcohol?\u201d\u201cI sprinkled some on my clothes.\u201d Shen Dai explained, \u201cotherwise others will smell your pheromones.\u201dThis time, Qu Moyu even frowned. He felt that Shen Dai was right and did the right thing, but he was still unhappy: \u201cLao Wu, go to the mall first to change his clothes.\u201dShen Dai opened his mouth, but in the end he didn\u2019t say anything. Qu Moyu was used to not accepting rejection and his refusal would be meaningless.Qu Moyu took Shen Dai to a men\u2019s clothing store and handed him over to the shopping assistant: \u201cGive him a few more sets of casual clothes, which can be worn at work and also at ordinary times.\u201d\u201cOkay, Mr. Qu.\u201dQu Moyu sat aside and made a phone call. Shen Dai watched the shopping assistant gesturing towards him some of the clothes one by one, and after accidentally looking at the price tag, he thought, \u2018I definitely can\u2019t wear it to work.\u2019When he was trying on the clothes, his phone vibrated twice. And when he opened it, he saw that it was from Cheng Zimei:\u00a0why are you running so fast? The crown prince has been in your office for so long, what were you two talking about?The message was followed by a few excited emoticons.With the clothes in his hand, Shen Dai could only reply using voice notes:\u00a0we talked about work.After Cheng Zimei sent another message but he didn\u2019t reply.When Shen Dai finished changing his clothes and went out, he was listening to the surprise \u201cBrother Yu\u201d called out by someone when a radiant couple walked in, arm in arm. It was Qu Chengchen and You Baiyue, followed by a man who was carrying a handful of large and small bags.Qu Chengchen raised his eyebrows in surprise: \u201cBig brother actually goes shopping with my sister-in-law.\u201d\u201cGot a problem with that?\u201dQu Chengchen smiled but did not say a word. He only looked at Shen Dai with a deeper meaning.Shen Dai stood not far away, not knowing how to react for a moment.\u201cBrother Yu, you bring my brother here to buy clothes.\u201d You Baiyue walked to Shen Dai in a few steps, \u201cThis body is okay, but this brand is not suitable for you as a whole, it\u2019s too business-like.\u201d He turned his head and said to Qu Moyu, \u201cYu Brother, you don\u2019t usually wear a lot of ready-to-wear clothes, so why did you choose to buy him clothes here? He\u2019s a young omega, this kind of clothes is too dull.\u201d There was a bit of coquettish resentment in his tone, and it was soft. This kind of pretty face can indeed easily break off alpha\u2019s bones.Qu Moyu likes someone \u2018being coquettish to him\u2019, but Shen Dai really can\u2019t learn how to do it.\u201cHe usually wears plain clothes.\u201d Qu Moyu looked at You Baiyue with a smile, \u201cThen you can choose for him? I\u2019m afraid the one you choose might be suitable for him.\u201d\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go, I\u2019ll take you to another store.\u201dShen Dai said politely, \u201cNo need, I usually have to go to work. So it\u2019s better to be a little more dull.\u201d\u201cYou have to go to work and live. Believe me, I promise to make you look much better.\u201d You Baiyue said with a smile, \u201cIt looks more suitable for Brother Yu.\u201dShen Dai turned a deaf ear to his sarcasm, whether intentional or unintentional, and said calmly, \u201cThank you. No need.\u201dQu Chengchen beckoned to You Baiyue: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about what people like to wear, aren\u2019t you tired already? Let\u2019s go eat.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d You Baiyue said to Qu Moyu, \u201cWhere is Brother Yu going to eat? Let\u2019s go together.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s heart tightened, and he looked at Qu Moyu. He hoped that Qu Moyu would refuse, because this was their \u2018date\u2019. Even if it was only as a bit of compensation, even if it wasn\u2019t in the way that he wanted, he still can\u2019t help but to look forward to it.However, Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes were looking at You Baiyue. It was so easy to see how his eyes glowed. He agreed without any hesitation.Shen Dai lowered his eyes sadly, feeling unspeakable in his heart. He solemnly warned himself in his heart;\u00a0don\u2019t, don\u2019t expect any more from Qu Mo.The restaurant they went to overlooked the most prosperous night scene in the city. The dishes are improved Chinese dishes, and the dishes are exquisite and delicious. It is indeed a suitable place for a date.Shen Dai ate in silence and listened to the three of them talking about interesting happenings in their childhood. Perhaps it was because You Baiyue was here that the Qu family brothers were rarely at odds with each other. On the contrary, he himself was an outsider who couldn\u2019t understand what they were talking about and couldn\u2019t participate in their stories. He just hoped that it would end sooner so he could go home and revise his thesis.After eating for the whole length of seven minutes, Shen Dai got up and went to the bathroom. After he went to the toilet, he stood in front of the mirror in the bathroom and looked at himself. He wore expensive clothes which are focused on texture and tailoring. Compared with the cheap sweaters and shirts he wore before, the cashmere sweaters and casual trousers with the price of tens of thousands RMB are indeed attractive. It looks distinctive.It is said that people need clothes to show off. It is a necessary disguise to get around in the mundane world. But disguise is \u2018not real\u2019 after all. Even if he and his tablemates wear clothes of the same price, they are still not from the same world.He really didn\u2019t know what he was doing here.Just when he was in a daze, a man came into the view in the mirror and gave him a wink.Shen Dai lowered his head and pretended to wash his hands, You Baiyue leaned beside him and said with a smile, \u201cOh yeah. Brother Yu never accompany anyone to buy clothes. This kind of boring thing, if he can spend money, he won\u2019t waste time on it.\u201d\u201cMy clothes were dirty.\u201d Shen Dai left those words indifferently, and turned to leave.You Baiyue stood in front of him. He then said innocently and aggrievedly: \u201cWhy do you always resist me so much? It was as if I would do something bad to you. Do you have persecution paranoia?\u201d\u201cWhy are you interested in me so much?\u201d Shen Dai asked him back, \u201cHave I ever threatened you?\u201dYou Baiyue was stunned for a moment, then smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019d like to say that in fact, I really hope you can handle Brother Yu. We are still connected by blood. Be smart and I can help you.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Shen Dai frowned and looked at You Baiyue, \u201cI don\u2019t want to have too much interaction with the likes of you. I think I made it very clear. It would be rude of you to do this again.\u201dYou Baiyue laughed and said: \u201cOh, if I\u2019m rude, what can you do to me? You really don\u2019t know what to do. Don\u2019t you want to get the mark from Brother Yu? Don\u2019t pretend, I won\u2019t believe it.\u201dShen Dai sarcastically said: \u201cIt\u2019s what you yourself can\u2019t get. Why do you have to bring it up repeatedly? Are you obsessed?\u201dYou Baiyue widened her eyes and said angrily: \u201cYou are not only ignorant of what\u2019s good or bad for you, but you are also incompetent. To be able to be with S-class alphas, you can do whatever you want with money, fame and fortune. As long as you have the ability, it is not impossible to get the mark. But you\u2019re ridiculous. You only want affection.\u201d\u201cYou may have an obsession, but I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cTop alphas have no emotions.\u201d You Baiyue stared at Shen Dai, with clear bloodshot eyes gradually emerging, \u201cTheir life philosophy can only be summed up in one word \u2013 \u2018victory\u2019.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You Baiyue and Qu Chengchen were the same age, and they were classmates before high school, so they were naturally closer. As the characteristics of the second sex became more pronounced during adolescence, coupled with studying abroad, the three became less acquainted after a few years apart.The marriage contract between Qu Moyu and You Baiyue was also based on the terms of business cooperation. It was not set in childhood as imagined by Shen Dai. From their conversation, Shen Dai could already guess what happened to the You family, who had been going downhill for many years. Things which are beneficial for Qu Moyu \u2013 prospecting and mining rights.As early as fifteen years ago, the state stopped issuing relevant qualifications to private enterprises. The previous ones had to be reviewed and evaluated by various departments such as land resources, planning, and environmental protection for every three years. If they failed, they would be withdrawn. It also has the qualifications to present complete documents. The value is inestimable.Due to a major mistake in the strategic direction, the You family missed the technological development in the mining field, which resulted in the loss of international competitiveness and most of the market. Today, the stock price has plummeted and the debt is heavy, but the You family\u2019s assets which were accumulated over the years are still very considerable. The mining resources, talents, technology, equipment and qualifications that have come down have attracted many companies in the industry.For the protection of strategic resources, You family\u2019s mergers and acquisitions must completely exclude foreign-funded enterprises, and there are only a handful of companies that can afford such a large plate. The final competition falls between a state-owned enterprise and Xingzhou. From the perspective of policy risk, the You family is more inclined to state-owned enterprises, but from the perspective of interests, Xingzhou can give them more profits. The qualifications of some minerals owned by the You family are just what Xingzhou lacks and wants to develop. Under the pressure from above, to win this important merger and consolidate the relationship between the two, it is necessary to rely on marriage to gain more rationality and trust.This information has been analysed by many industry insiders on the Internet, but they do not know that the object of Qu Moyu\u2019s marriage has changed from You Baiyue to Shen Dai, and Shen Dai also confirmed from their conversation that this was the marriage\u2019s true goal.At present, the complicated mergers and acquisitions are still in progress. Obviously, the day the hammer fell was the day he and Qu Moyu would be divorced.When talking about topics related to mergers and acquisitions, You Baiyue naturally puts away the state that seems to be releasing its charm all the time. He is very concerned about the progress of the entire cooperation. He speaks clearly and has relevant knowledge reserves regarding them. Obviously, he does not only understand fashion and fun.Shen Dai listened quietly, thinking about what You Baiyue said in the bathroom just now. Perhaps, this person is more intelligent, sober and more managerial than he thinks. At least, he must have known alphas better than himself.Shen Dai took a peek at Qu Moyu without being obvious. This person shines at all times. This person makes countless people yearn for him. He might not be a person without feelings or emotions, but perhaps someone who can affect his feelings has not yet appeared in front of him.After eating, You Baiyue and Qu Chengchen walked away holding hands. The two seem to be lovers in love. Qu Chengchen will peel the shrimp for You Baiyue and You Baiyue will feed him. But these impeccable intimacies make Shen Dai feel awkward most of the time. He feels like the two are acting. And he doesn\u2019t know if they are acting for others to see or for each other.He doesn\u2019t know how Qu Moyu feels when he sees the love between the two. After all, that was his fianc\u00e9e, the one he likes and wants to marry. When comparing heart to heart, will Qu Moyu not feel pain because of love like him?Qu Moyu replied a few messages before raising his head and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d He appears to be indifferent.Shen Dai didn\u2019t say anything. Before he got up and left the table, he took a last look at the night scene outside the window. It seemed that he had sat by the window that night, sitting opposite of Qu Moyu while enjoying the bustling city that never sleeps. When people have dinner together, no matter how much estrangement there is in his heart, he will still be happy for that momentary dream, but unfortunately\u2026 He is afraid that such an opportunity will never come again in the future.When they were in the car, Qu Moyu asked, \u201cWhat did You Baiyue say in the bathroom?\u201d\u201cHe said I should dress better.\u201d Shen Dai has been thinking about how to answer Qu Moyu\u2019s inevitable questions. He can\u2019t directly say that both You Baiyue and Qu Chengchen want to help him get Qu Moyu\u2019s mark.Qu Moyu laughed and said, \u201cDress up better, for what? To seduce me?\u201dShen Dai spoke in a low voice, \u201cThat\u2019s probably what he meant.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to rely on clothes.\u201d Qu Moyu glanced at Shen Dai sideways, \u201cHowever, you really should learn from him how to please your alpha.\u201dEven though he knew that this was just Qu Moyu being flirtatious, Shen Dai was still heartbroken hearing \u2018your alpha\u2019.\u201cWe get bored sometimes.\u201d Qu Moyu played with the simple platinum ring on the index finger of his left hand, \u201cI\u2019ve been busy all day. So I hope you can make me feel more relaxed and happy when I get home. Don\u2019t talk to me about work if I don\u2019t take the initiative to mention it.\u201dShen Dai lowered his head and said solemnly, \u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cHowever, you are actually smarter and more interesting than most omegas. It\u2019s not because of your interesting personality, but\u2026\u201d Qu Moyu didn\u2019t say anything after \u2018but\u2019. It seems difficult to describe Shen Dai\u2019s interesting personality in words. This person is \u2018interesting\u2019 but only he has really seen, enjoyed, and possessed them.From Qu Moyu\u2019s point of view, these remarks are regarded as a compliment, but in Shen Dai\u2019s ears, they are undoubtedly contemptuous in disguise. But after this whole day of discussions, his heart has become numb, and he can\u2019t even feel the pain. Compared to what Qu Moyu did in his office in the afternoon, these sentences couldn\u2019t hurt much. He asked calmly, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and chase You Baiyue back?\u201d After a pause, he continued, \u201cHe meets all your requirements.\u201dQu Moyu glanced at Shen Dai unexpectedly, if it wasn\u2019t for Shen Dai\u2019s indifferent expression, he would have thought these words were provocative. He said: \u201cAt that time, everyone thought that he was really marked by Qu Chengchen. Neither me nor my family can accept this.\u201d\u201cBut you know now that it was just a temporary mark. And they weren\u2019t married.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the need? I already got what I want.\u201d\u201cBusiness cooperation is only one aspect of it. Don\u2019t you\u2026\u201d Shen Dai secretly stabilised his mind, \u201cDon\u2019t you like him and want to marry him?\u201dQu Moyu smiled: \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult to find another S-class omega suitable for marriage.\u201dShen Dai looked at Qu Moyu\u2019s confident appearance but felt chills all over his body. In the eyes of these people, marriage seems to be just a budget-conscious business. He finally understood that Qu Moyu\u2019s love for You Baiyue was nothing but an affirmation of You Baiyue\u2019s social value and reproductive value. It was a compliment to the partner, and a constant stimulation to Qu Chengchen, a competitor. It\u2019s not just love in the mundane sense, that heavy, ritualistic, shy and beautiful emotion in the hearts of ordinary people.It\u2019s ridiculous that he is worried that Qu Moyu will suffer because of love. It is naturally the trouble that only ordinary beings like him have. As for the S-class alpha\u2026\u201cS-class alphas have no emotions,\u201d You Baiyue\u2019s words echoed in his ears repeatedly.When the day of grandma\u2019s surgery finally arrived, Shen Dai was restless. But he still had to look full of confidence in order to comfort his grandmother constantly and show her various panda videos to help her relax.Cheng Ruoze was helping him with various procedures. At this moment, Shen Dai was very grateful to Qu Moyu. The elderly in the family were sick and needed help the most. Without Cheng Ruoze\u2019s help, he would definitely be more embarrassed by himself.Seeing the moment his grandmother entered the operating room, Shen Dai finally sat on the chair tiredly, took a deep breath, and began to pray for the kindness of various gods to make the operation go smoothly.Cheng Ruoze sat next to Shen Dai and comforted: \u201cShen Gong, you don\u2019t have to worry too much. The doctor is confident. Your grandma will be okay.\u201d\u201cThank you, Assistant Cheng. You have been helping me a lot during this time.\u201d Shen Dai said sincerely.\u201cIt\u2019s my job. It should be.\u201dHaving said that, it is really inappropriate for a graduate of a famous school to do such chores, but Cheng Ruoze is hard-working and very careful and appropriate. Shen Dai feels sorry for him: \u201cIn any case, I am very grateful to you. When grandma is stable, I will invite you to dinner.\u201dCheng Ruoze said with a smile: \u201cThen I will welcome this meal.\u201d Looking at Shen Dai\u2019s pale face and worried eyes, he sighed secretly in his heart. Why is this person his boss\u2019s contract wife?Shen Dai looked at his watch: \u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten yet. It\u2019s almost noon.\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten either. I know you must wait here. Let me go buy two lunch boxes and come back to eat with you.\u201d\u201cOkay, thank you. I have to make you work hard again.\u201dCheng Ruoze said with a smile, \u201cDon\u2019t be too polite with me.\u201dAfter Cheng Ruoze left, Shen Dai closed his eyes and leaned against the wall. He hadn\u2019t slept well last night and now his tense nerves relaxed a little. Sleepiness and tiredness swept over him.Just when he was about to fall asleep in a daze, he heard a clearly timid, small voice not far away from him: \u201cAh Dai.\u201dTo Shen Dai, the sound was like thunder on the ground. He suddenly opened his eyes, and in his eyes, he saw a vague outline of a thin, fair, and weak man. His scalp was numb, and he stood up subconsciously.The clearer and clearer he saw the person in front of him, the more disgusted he felt. Even though the man looks good-looking. The years of old age left on his face are not prominent. He is a gentle, graceful, handsome and elegant person that makes people want to look at him. The eyes will have a good feeling in the heart about his personality. Only if you can\u2019t see his true nature.Shen Dai only felt cold down to the bone in his hands and feet. He slowly clenched his fists, looked at this familiar but also unfamiliar person \u2013 his omega father, Shen Qin \u2013 and asked coldly, \u201cHow did you find this place?\u201d\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.04.26\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: Even Cheng Ruoze acknowledges Shen Dai\u2019s charm. Lol. Sorry for any mistakes. I didn\u2019t have time to proofread as I am busy with my thesis and also I got infected with the damn virus. Damn it! It was a horrible experience! -KPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 29": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShen Qin\u2019s expression was sad and pitiful. It was as if he had been greatly wronged: \u201cI know you don\u2019t want to see me. So I\u2026 went to your workplace to wait for you and followed you home.\u201dShen Dai was trembling with anger: \u201cAm I not clear enough on the phone? What exactly are you trying to do?\u201d\u201cAh Dai, your father just wanted to see his mother. He didn\u2019t want to do anything.\u201d Shen Qin shook his head while rolling his eyes, \u201cHow is your grandma? How long will the operation take?\u201d\u201cYou finally think of your mother now? When you did those things, did you ever think about what your elderly parents would rely on to survive in their later years?!\u201d Shen Dai thought that after so many years, when facing this person again, he can be truly indifferent and decisive. But it turns out that his emotions are still surging. This was supposed to be the person he loved the most, but he became the person he hated the most and didn\u2019t want to see in his life. Those who had never experienced it would not understand what kind of tearing pain it was.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I really didn\u2019t mean to get to this point. He said he could make more money.\u201d Shen Qin said sadly, \u201cAh Dai, I have explained it many times. I know you can\u2019t forgive me. I just want to see your grandma. I\u2019m so worried about her, and I\u2019m worried about you. You are so busy with work now, you definitely don\u2019t have time to take care of your grandma, I think I can\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, grandma\u2019s surgery will be successful. I will take care of her and find a nanny for her. We really don\u2019t need you anymore in our life. You disappeared in the first place, and since you are gone, you shouldn\u2019t appear again now. \u201c\u201cI couldn\u2019t face you at the time. I wanted to earn some money back and come back to you.\u201d Shen Qin choked, \u201cAh Dai, after so many years, can you give Dad a chance? Your grandma is old and sick. She really needs someone to take care of her. How can a nanny be more attentive than a family member?\u201d\u201cAre you worthy of being family member? You\u2026\u201d\u201cYour grandma misses me.\u201d Shen Qin said with tears, \u201cI called her before. Although she also blamed me, but I know she misses me very much.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s lips trembled and he was speechless. How could he not know that his grandmother told him hesitantly that day that her heart must have been shaken. And no matter how much resentment there was, this person was her only son. Especially when she feared that she was almost reaching the end of her life. How could she not want to say goodbye to your children? Had it not been for Shen Dai\u2019s apparent resistance and disgust, this man would have appeared earlier.Shen Qin pleaded again: \u201cAh Dai, can you give your dad a chance to atone for his sins? At least at this time, your grandma must be needing me.\u201dShen Dai was really unable to pull him away from the front of the operating room door: \u201cYou go back first. And when grandma is discharged from the hospital, she will talk to you if she wants to see you.\u201d\u201cNo matter what, I want to see her today. I\u2019ll wait by the side. When she comes out of the operating room, I\u2019ll take a look and leave, okay?\u201d Shen Qin whispered, \u201cI promise not to disturb her. She just passed the anaesthesia. She won\u2019t notice me.\u201dShen Dai only felt exhausted and powerless. He knew that he couldn\u2019t get rid of him. Blood ties were a bond that would never stop in his life. How could he be able to persuade him to quit with just a few words? Besides, no matter what the purpose of Shen Qin\u2019s return was, he was never the kind of person to easily let go. Shen Dai only cares about his grandmother\u2019s condition now so he has no intention to deal with it.Seeing that Shen Dai had acquiesced, Shen Qin stood across the corridor and kept a short distance from his son. He hesitated several times and asked cautiously, \u201cIs your job going well?\u201dShen Dai lowered his head and turned a deaf ear. After a long silence, Shen Qin also gave up.After a while, Cheng Ruoze came back with a lunch box and two cups of milk tea in his hand.\u201cShen Gong, I forgot to ask you what you want to drink. I bought milk tea and water. Adding some sugar can make you feel better\u2026\u201d Cheng Ruoze\u2019s out-of-the-way light glanced at Shen Qin beside him and he was stunned for a moment.Shen Dai\u2019s stature and face are seven-point similar to Shen Qin\u2019s, but lacking Shen Dai\u2019s heroic spirit and having more of an omega\u2019s softness, slenderness and fairness. He wore a simple beige cotton and linen suit, lining the plain white walls of the hospital. With the texture of the film, although it can be seen that he is old, he is still a rare beauty.Cheng Ruoze confirmed their father-son relationship at a glance: \u201cAh, this is\u2026\u201dShen Dai interrupted him: \u201cAssistant Cheng, I can drink milk tea.\u201d\u201cOh, okay.\u201d Cheng Ruoze put the bag on the chair and asked Shen Dai through gestures of his eyes. He could sense the tension between the two.Shen Dai whispered: \u201cDon\u2019t ask. Let\u2019s eat.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Although Cheng Ruoze didn\u2019t know Shen Dai\u2019s background very well, he had also heard some pieces of information from Qu Moyu or lawyer Chen. The illegitimate child had long had some family problems so he naturally had to shut up as an outsider.Shen Qin felt embarrassed himself. So he stood a little further away.The operation took nearly five hours and finally ended successfully. The moment his grandmother was pushed out, Shen Dai knew that the operation was a success when he saw the expression on the nurse\u2019s face. He was so excited that his nose was sore and his eyes were wet.Cheng Ruoze was so happy that he applauded again and again, congratulating Shen Dai and thanking the doctor, acting like a family member.Shen Qin also came over, and the moment he saw his mother, he burst into tears. His grandmother was still in the unconscious period due to the anaesthesia.Shen Dai\u2019s grandmother was pushed into the monitoring ward and everyone had to wait outside.Shen Dai calmed down, thanked the doctor and nurse, and carefully recorded all the doctor\u2019s requirements for him.Shen Qin looked through the window for a while, then wiped away his tears and left.Shen Dai leaned against the back of the chair with all his strength, feeling that the day was too long, so long that something was poking his heart every minute, he looked at Cheng Ruoze gratefully: \u201cAssistant Cheng, really\u2026 Thank you. You have been waiting with me in the hospital for a day. You should go home and rest.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. What about you? Go back and rest. You can\u2019t enter this ICU ward either.\u201d\u201cWell, the doctor said to observe for three days, and if it\u2019s all right, she will be transferred to the general ward. I want to stay for a while before leaving.\u201d Shen Dai wiped his face, \u201cYou can go back first.\u201d\u201cDo you really not need me to accompany you?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019ll be gone after a while. I\u2019ve troubled you for a long time already.\u201dCheng Ruoze left a few words of comfort and left the hospital first.Shen Dai sat and rested for a while. He then got up and leaned over the door, looking at his grandmother lying on the hospital bed through the small window. She was the sustenance of his sense of belonging and his only home.The phone vibrated twice, Shen Dai took it out and saw that it was a message from Qu Moyu:\u00a0Xiao Cheng said the operation was a success. Congratulations.Shen Dai\u2019s eyes were hot, he wanted to reply, but his fingers were so busy that he always made typos. So he simply sent a voice message saying: \u201cWell, it was very successful. Just a few more days of observation then she can be transferred to the general ward. Mo Yu, thank you.\u201dQu Moyu helped him and rescued him time and time again, which is why he still fell for him hopelessly even after discovering so much arrogance and ruthlessness in Qu Moyu\u2019s character.Soon, Qu Moyu also replied with a voice message: \u201cAre you still in the hospital?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still here. I can\u2019t get into the ward, but I want to accompany her for a while.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m nearby. I\u2019ll go take a look.\u201dShen Dai nervously pressed it down before he even finished listening to the last speech. His thumb hovered over the white speech bar, only to hear his heart pounding. He touched it lightly. The deep and pleasant voice of Qu Moyu came again.He said he wanted to come and see.Even if it is only because of him being nearby, or he is on the way towards wherever his destination is, or even out on a whim, he is coming to visit Shen Dai\u2019s sick family members. This is a sign of concern, isn\u2019t it?Shen Dai listened to the speech repeatedly, until he mastered the rhythm and tone of each word, making it endlessly loop in his mind. Only then he could be sure that he heard it right. It is not a dream after a long and tiring day.In less than a quarter of an hour, Qu Moyu arrived.Shen Dai stared at Qu Moyu for two seconds, then walked up a few steps and threw himself into his arms. For the first time in her life, Shen Dai wanted to rely on a person so much when he was not in heat and completely sober.A trace of surprise flashed in Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes, but it was quickly replaced by tenderness. He put one arm around Shen Dai\u2019s waist and stroked the soft hair with the other: \u201cWere you afraid? It\u2019s all right now.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s alright now. The doctor said that the effect of the operation was better than expected.\u201d Shen Dai choked up as he spoke, \u201cGrandma will get better soon.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d Qu Moyu looked at Shen Dai\u2019s reddened eyes, and couldn\u2019t help lowering his head to kiss his thin, warm eyelids, \u201cThen don\u2019t cry.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t cry.\u201d Shen Dai stopped the loss of control of his tears, looked at Qu Moyu solemnly and said, \u201cThank you for arranging such a good doctor and hospital for me.\u201d\u201cIt should be.\u201d Qu Moyu hooked Shen Dai\u2019s chin with his fingers as if he was teasing a puppy, \u201cYou are my person now. If you have any problems, I will solve it for you.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s pupils shone brightly, as if the light of Qu Moyu\u2019s halo reflected in his eyes, filling his eyes with this person, and at the same time, the desperate and unattainable despair flooded into his heart again. He finally understood why so many omegas had to fight for the top alpha one after another. He thought he liked Qu Moyu because of the laboratory accident. He thought he himself was different from most omegas and was never willing to be a dependent. In fact, he couldn\u2019t defy his instincts at all, even if he and Qu Moyu had no relationship before, as long as they got close, he would still be tempted, and he longed to have a powerful alpha that only belonged to him.Perhaps it was this day that his hanging heart was constantly simulating between life and death, which gave him a more transparent understanding of life in the shortest possible time. He can choose to avoid it, suppress it, endure it, pretend that he doesn\u2019t care about it, or pretend that he has done a complete psychological construction over it. But he can\u2019t bear the thought that in the end, they will have no future together.If he knew that he couldn\u2019t bear it, then he should not bear it. If he can\u2019t complete a scientific exploration after spending his whole life, will he stop moving forward? If he didn\u2019t do anything, no future between them will be the only result.But if he takes action, there may be other possibilities.He wants Qu Moyu to become his alpha. And to achieve this goal, he needs to take action.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.04.27\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: Shen Qin deserves to be slapped with my sandals.

    "Chapter 30": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter returning home that day, Shen Dai took the initiative to pull Qu Moyu into his room for the first time, and tore off the sticker on the gland, releasing the tranquil epiphyllum pheromone. He also tried his best to smell the ebony wood pheromone of Qu Moyu.Qu Moyu was very pleased with Shen Dai\u2019s initiative. He took off his suit jacket, picked up Shen Dai and threw him on the bed.The pheromones of the two people blended in the air, and gradually became indistinguishable from each other. The ebony fragrance was cold and the epiphyllum fragrance was sweet. The combination produced an intoxicating smell. The lust was surging, and every nerve was endlessly numbing\u2026Shen Dai went to the hospital to visit his grandmother every day after work. The hospital is not far from the company and the traffic is not bad. Qu Moyu hired the best doctor from a public hospital to perform the operation in a private hospital with better environment and nursing care. He was very thoughtful, so how could Shen Dai not be moved?His grandmother woke up the next day, but he still couldn\u2019t visit her. So Shen Dai watched her through the glass window for a while.It was not until the third day that the doctor informed him that his grandmother could be transferred to the general ward. He took an afternoon off, brought the daily necessities and nutritional products that he had prepared earlier, and went to the hospital.His grandmother was placed in a private ward, and the hospital itself had nursing care, but it was not exclusive. The nursing workers hired by Shen Dai were already waiting in the hospital. When he couldn\u2019t wait to knock on the door of the ward, he saw not only the grandmother who had woken up was in the room but Shen Qin was there too, standing beside the bed.When the two of them saw him, their expressions were a little stiff. Shen Dai was also stunned. He didn\u2019t speak, his eyes were heavy, and his face looked very bad.Shen Qin lowered his head and whispered uncomfortably, \u201cI\u2019ve been watching over your grandma. But I just didn\u2019t dare to let you know.\u201dHis grandmother looked embarrassed, obviously she was feeling conflicted.Shen Dai didn\u2019t want the patient who just finished the operation to have too many emotional fluctuations. Although he was full of resentment towards Shen Qin, he didn\u2019t reprimand or drive him away. He walked over and held his grandmother\u2019s thin shoulder: \u201cGrandma, how are you feeling now?\u201dHis grandmother smiled: \u201cI feel much better. The wound doesn\u2019t hurt as much. In fact, when I was in the ICU, you came to see me a lot. I\u2019m afraid it would delay your work.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s there to delay?\u201d Shen Dai comforted her gently, \u201cThe operation was successful, and the tumour was basically removed. As long as you cooperate with the subsequent treatment, you will be completely better.\u201d\u2018To be completely better\u2019 is naturally a beautiful ideal, but the unexpected success of this operation gave them great confidence and made them dare to have more hope.Shen Qin got up knowingly: \u201cI\u2019m going to go buy something.\u201dAfter Shen Qin left, his grandmother and Shen Dai looked at each other.After a long while, Shen Dai sighed: \u201cHe also called me before. But I didn\u2019t want to see him. So he went to my workplace to wait for me, and then followed me to this hospital.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s been like this since he was a child. As long as it\u2019s what he wants to do, he doesn\u2019t care about what others think.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 what do you think about this?\u201dHis grandmother lowered her eyes sadly and was silent for a long time.Shen Dai took his grandmother\u2019s hand. In his childhood memories, his grandmother\u2019s hands were very beautiful. The fingers were long and delicate, white and tender. These hands could draw, cook, play the piano, illustrate, and do many beautiful and romantic things. She was very talented. Now, these hands are scrawny and the purple-brown blood vessels are prominent. The skin has lost its elasticity and it feels like damp paper. She could have been a carefree young lady but she chose to be a mother.The moment he stepped into the ward, he knew that his grandmother had softened his heart. It seemed that she had forgiven him. As a mother, she could never give up on her child.His grandmother raised her face with tears in her eyes: \u201cI looked at him today and found that he is also already old and has not had a good life these years\u2026 I always thought of him as a child.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s eyes were also red: \u201cGrandma, if you really want to give him a chance to make up for it, I\u2019ll let him take care of you. He should also\u2026know that he was wrong.\u201d He resisted ten thousand times in his heart to say this. But he also knows that this is what his grandmother wants to hear and wishes for at the moment.His grandmother stroked Shen Dai\u2019s face and choked: \u201cYou haven\u2019t done anything wrong. But you\u2019re always the one who suffers.\u201dShen Dai forced a smile: \u201cI don\u2019t think I have any hardships. You and grandpa were so good to me. I have had no worries about food and clothing since I was a child. I have a good education and a good job. And now, I have the ability to take care of you. I am very satisfied.\u201dHis grandmother gently wrapped her hands around Shen Dai\u2019s head: \u201cAh Dai, grandma didn\u2019t feel bitter when I raised you, really.\u201dShen Dai closed his eyes and silently sniffed the smell of hydrogen peroxide mixed with his grandmother\u2019s scent. It didn\u2019t smell good, but it was warm and reassuring.Shen Dai\u2019s grandmother gets tired easily now. After chatting for a while, she fell asleep. Shen Dai walked out the door and unexpectedly saw Shen Qin sitting on the chair in the corridor.The eyes of the father and son met in the air. The indifferent but calm is the son. The cautious and guilty is the father.Shen Dai stood against the wall and said calmly, \u201cGrandma definitely wants her son to take care of her, so you can take care of her. The nursing worker will be working until grandma is discharged from the hospital. After she is discharged, you can do it alone at home.\u201dShen Qin nodded quickly: \u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cDo you have a job now? Do you have any income?\u201d\u201c\u2026I only have a little savings.\u201d\u201cI will pay you the salary according to the housekeeper\u2019s salary. And I will also pay for the daily expenses. You should allocate it reasonably. You will need to keep an account. You can save it if you can, but you can\u2019t save it if they\u2019re for grandma\u2019s food and clothing.\u201d He knew Shen Qin. In addition to finding an alpha to rely on, he has no self-reliance skills. Originally, Shen Qin could have a good education and get a good career, but all his time and energy were wasted on one failed relationship after another. Without money, it is difficult to accept ordinary life.\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Shen Qin hesitated, \u201cAh Dai, can I ask you some questions?\u201d\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\u201cYour grandma said that you have mortgaged a house and this hospital is very expensive.\u201dShen Dai became alert. He wondered if his grandmother had told him how he got the money. He thought ironically that he was still slandering Shen Qin for relying on alpha. If he didn\u2019t have Qu Moyu, he would be extremely embarrassed as well.\u201cShe said you got the bonus, but\u2026\u201d Shen Qin\u2019s hesitation revealed his doubts. After all, to pay off the debt, to still be able to buy a house and to get into a private hospital, a huge sum of money is needed.\u201cBut what?\u201d Shen Dai didn\u2019t want to answer.\u201cActually, on the day of the operation, I left the hospital very late. I wanted to wait until you left to see your grandma. Then at the hospital gate, I saw you and an alpha boarded a car together.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s eyes narrowed. He suddenly became icy cold.\u201cAh Dai, don\u2019t be angry. I didn\u2019t mean to stalk you. I was just surprised. That alpha looks very\u2026\u201d\u201cI hope you don\u2019t ask me about my privacy.\u201d Shen Dai said mercilessly, \u201cFrom the moment you abandoned this family, there is no relationship between the two of us. If you take good care of grandma in the future, we will be at peace with each other and that\u2019s that.\u201dShen Qin\u2019s shoulders shrank back, looking very aggrieved: \u201cI see. No matter what, your dad just wants you to be happy and won\u2019t end up like me.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t be like you.\u201d Shen Dai turned around and went back to the ward.Across the door, Shen Dai seemed to still be able to feel Shen Qin\u2019s exploratory gaze. He closed his eyes and felt a headache.When he said \u201cI won\u2019t be like you\u201d, Qu Moyu\u2019s face appeared in front of him inexplicably. Because no matter how determined his tone was, his heart was erratic. Back then, when You Xinghai pursued Shen Qin, did Shen Qin also think that it was his destined alpha, that the two of them would be together forever? But when a person has such expectations for love, how can they believe that they will have a bad ending?It was Friday the next day. After work, Cheng Zimei brought some supplements with her to see Shen Dai\u2019s grandmother.On the way, Shen Dai told her about Shen Qin\u2019s return, and she was also very resentful. After all, she knew about the embarrassment and pain that Shen Dai had to go through back then. When Shen Dai was doing an internship, writing a dissertation, and competing for the talent plan of Baoyan and Xingzhou, such a big incident happened to his family. This kind of blow would probably make most people slumped, but Shen Dai gritted his teeth and stood up while fighting. He still accomplished all his goals. She remembered that at that time, Shen Dai lost more than ten kilograms, only slept for four or five hours a day, and once fainted because of anaemia. In those years, Shen Dai was oppressed and difficult.Shen Dai finally stood up on his own. When Shen Qin came back at this time, he just couldn\u2019t get along and wanted to rely on his son again.Cheng Zimei said angrily: \u201cIf he is really guilty, he should disappear completely and not increase your burden.\u201d\u201cI expected that one day he would come back, when he had no one to rely on.\u201d Shen Dai sighed, \u201cNo way. Anyway, I still have legal support obligations.\u201d\u201cAh Dai, you are really miserable.\u201d Cheng Zimei looked at Shen Dai distressedly and couldn\u2019t help stroking his hair, \u201cYou should find a capable alpha to marry, so that someone can help you. It must be easier than being alone.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easy for you to say.\u201d\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is very practical. For us ordinary people, isn\u2019t marriage just about sharing costs and supporting each other? If you happen to find someone rich, how many troubles can you solve?\u201d Cheng Zimei blinked, \u201cFor example, Zhou Lan. I have inquired about him. His parents have bought him a house. He plans to settle down in the capital. His conditions are really good. He is young, smart, and has a bright future.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for me and him.\u201d Shen Dai said seriously, \u201cReally.\u201dCheng Zimei sighed and said mysteriously, \u201cThen, what about the crown prince?\u201dShen Dai trembled in his heart and said calmly, \u201cIt\u2019s also impossible.\u201d\u201cOh, I really want him to be with you. What is impossible? Because you are a scientific researcher, your ideal is to make the impossible possible. What kind of scientific research can we do without this energy?!\u201d\u201cWhere are you going with this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to happen soon!\u201d Cheng Zimei waved her fist at him, \u201cIt\u2019s up to the person. Besides, I don\u2019t think the crown prince treats you normally. The two of you have been involved again and again. It\u2019s fate. Such a good opportunity, why don\u2019t you try it out?\u201d\u201cIt can get me fired.\u201d Shen Dai said coldly.Cheng Zimei couldn\u2019t hold back and laughed loudly. She couldn\u2019t stop laughing: \u201cCrown prince is really awesome. I remember there was an omega who was chasing him before. He was from an affiliated family. He had a good family background and he was so pretty. Ah. However, this lady has no experience in chasing alphas at first glance. How could she rush up towards a stupefied alpha when dealing with an S-class alpha like the crown prince?\u201dShen Dai teased her and said, \u201cYou speak as if you understand it well.\u201dCheng Zimei shrugged: \u201cThis sister of yours had started falling in love at the age of fourteen. What\u2019s the difficulty in grasping a man?\u201dShen Dai\u2019s heart moved. His eyes rolled and he asked in a nonchalant tone, \u201cThen tell me, how are you supposed to get an S-class alpha like the crown prince?\u201d====***The author has something to say:I won\u2019t be able to \u2018drive\u2019 in the near f uture, because emm\u2026 RS scared me last time, and there are many people carrying DY, which is really unsafe. I hope everyone will not spread it to the public in the future. Let\u2019s wait for winter vacation. When the heat drops a little. If not, I can only make it up after the end.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.04.28\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s Note: Allow me to translate what the author means in her note above. She said she got scared to write a smut scene because many people spread it online and it became a popular search item so she will wait until the heat cools down before writing another smut scene.Guys, this is necessary because of strict rules in China. If caught, she can be convicted to (1) homosexuality and (2) pornography which were both banned in China. So yeah. But spoiler alert the next smut scene will be in Chapter 46.

    "Chapter 31": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis question is like encountering Cheng Zimei\u2019s touch switch. The driver and Shen Dai were listening to her love theory and practical lessons during the entire journey, which made the driver stunned and sometimes echoed a few words.Cheng Zimei is a very interesting person. According to her own words, she is an all-around athlete. She does not delay in study, career, sports, image maintenance and love. Usually women or omegas who are engaged in scientific research pay more attention to academics. They paid attention to time to dress up. And falling in love is determined by the ratio of energy distribution. Most of them will lose one or the other. But Cheng Zimei\u2019s energy is terrifying and she has plenty of curiosity plus desire to explore everything, even if it is about love. To study and to conduct research with an academic attitude, she believes that this is a major branch of sociology, and of course it can be solved by integrating scientific knowledge.Shen Dai was moved by her point of view, because he believed in logic and dialectics, and no matter how big the individual differences between people are, the expression of words and deeds will be manipulated by genetic instincts. It is known that he and Qu Moyu have established many kinds of relationships. Under the premise of having a legal marriage relationship and intimate behaviour at the same time, he is the person who is most likely to impress Qu Moyu.During this period of time, he was trapped in emotions, making himself dizzy and worrying about gains and losses. This was a state he had never had in his life. To describe it in words, it is akin to him feeling dazed. He was at a loss because of the unknown and was at a loss because he was at a losing end. Even in the darkest moment of his life when the accident happened in his family, he was never at a loss, because he knew that those real problems could be solved by making money. He was young. Being capable is nothing more than suffering, but the path is clear and the direction is right.But he was completely blind when it came to the matter of love. It was a field he had never studied before. His heart was like a lonely boat floating in the sea, floating with Qu Moyu\u2019s words and deeds. Every single thing was out of his control. But he clearly has a strong learning ability and he is clearly very good at using his brain. He would fight rather than being timid and surrendering before a battle.As Cheng Zimei had said, if you don\u2019t have the spirit of studying and enterprising, what kind of scientific research workers are you? What he should do is not without difficulty. But when faced with difficulty, it does not mean that there is no hope of success.After getting out of the car, Cheng Zimei made a concluding statement: \u201cAnyway, if you have time, you should also learn a little knowledge on emotions. You have never been in love, which means you don\u2019t understand the alpha species at all.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cWhy are you suddenly curious about this today? Do you really want to pursue the crown prince?\u201d Cheng Zimei\u2019s eyes were full of excitement.\u201cNo. Just chatting with you casually.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t like doing this before at all. Hehe. Don\u2019t you feel a little anxious about what I had talked about?\u201dShen Dai smiled: \u201cAfter my grandma\u2019s surgery, I\u2019m in a good mood. I can talk about anything.\u201d\u201cIf you really like him, try it. I\u2019ll help you with your effort. It\u2019s not shameful to like someone. You can control your strength and you won\u2019t really get fired like the previous three omegas.\u201dShen Dai smiled without saying a word, thinking that he was going to do something unprecedented. He had been apprehensive day and night. But in comparison, at least he had more advantages and opportunities than anyone else. It was time to do some brainstorming, rather than thinking about emotional things.When she arrived at the hospital, Cheng Zimei was a little dumbfounded: \u201cIsn\u2019t this a private hospital?\u201d The hospital hall was decorated like a five-star hotel, where it looked like not a place to see a doctor, but like going for a vacation.Shen Dai was also very helpless. He wanted to let Cheng Zimei come to visit after his grandmother was discharged from the hospital, but she insisted on coming to see her immediately. It was hard to refuse, so he could only say an excuse that he had made up a long time ago: \u201cAs what I had said. This time it has to do with that \u2018good thing\u2019 we talked about, well\u2026 my biological alpha father gave me a sum of money.\u201dCheng Zimei nodded, not surprised: \u201cI guessed so. Who will give you money except him. Why? Your omega father is making trouble again? Didn\u2019t he just reappear?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t say why. Anyway, getting money is a good thing.\u201d\u201cUnderstood. Good things are still good things. Then you have no financial problems now so you can fall in love.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really much easier now.\u201d Shen Dai changed the subject, \u201cLet\u2019s go. It\u2019s this ward.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s grandmother had woken up at this time and was eating, with Shen Qin by her side. This looked like a picture of a son who was kind and filial to his mother. Shen Dai sighed in his heart. Maybe this is the best for his grandmother.\u201cAh Dai. Oops, Zimei is here.\u201d Grandma smiled brightly and stretched out her hand, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in a long time.\u201d\u201cGrandma, I miss you so much.\u201d Cheng Zimei also ran over happily, holding the grandmother\u2019s hand and asking for warmth. She has a sweet mouth and is very good at coaxing people.Shen Dai smiled and put some things down. When he looked at Shen Qin, he only nodded stiffly.Shen Qin said attentively, \u201cyour grandma ate a lot today and went down to the ground floor for a while in the afternoon. The doctor said that it\u2019s good to move around a little bit. She\u2019s recovering well.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good, I guess she can be discharged on time.\u201d Shen Dai took the flowers brought by Cheng Zimei out of the packaging and wanted to put them in a vase. When he turned his head, he found a bottle of an aroma diffuser on the bedside table. It looks brand new.Shen Qin explained following his gaze: \u201cOh, your grandma said that the hospital smells bad. This orange blossom smells a bit like my pheromone. It\u2019s very fragrant.\u201dShen Dai looked at the equally fragrant flowers in his hand, his eyes sank: \u201cThis bottle is a few hundred yuan.\u201d He just transferred \u00a5 3,000 living expenses to Shen Qin yesterday. He asked Shen Qin to get some high-nutrition foods to nourish his grandmother\u2019s body. As a result\u2026 He always knew that Shen Qin\u2019s consumption habits were bad. How much he spends, even if he has no money to eat tomorrow, he could spend thousands of dollars today just to do his hair. He will always remember that after Shen Qin made a million dollar from You Xinghai, he did not replace it with a practical fixed asset such as a house, but bought a sports car and squandered the rest within only a month.It\u2019s just that he thought that after experiencing the trials of life, people will change.\u201cUh\u2026but this fragrance is really good.\u201d Shen Qin said cautiously, \u201cI also want your grandma to feel more comfortable.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s grandmother let out a sigh.Cheng Zimei rolled her eyes secretly.In his grandmother\u2019s ward, Shen Dai didn\u2019t want to show that he was angry. He said solemnly, \u201cDon\u2019t buy these expensive and impractical things. I said before that you should keep an account for every transaction.\u201d It seems that next time he can\u2019t give too much money at once.Shen Qin said reluctantly: \u201cOkay. I see.\u201dThat weekend, Shen Dai stayed in the hospital for half of the time to accompany his grandmother and spent the other half of his time to arrange a new house. If she recovered well, she could be discharged from the hospital next week. He wanted her to live in their own house as soon as she was discharged from the hospital. But he discussed it with his grandmother, and he couldn\u2019t tell Shen Qin that the house was bought. He told him that it was only rented. After all, they all had a painful experience. Shen Qin was asking if he had a rich boyfriend so it made him more vigilant.On the night of returning to Qu\u2019s house, Shen Dai found Aunt Lan and said that he wanted to make breakfast for Qu Moyu himself in the morning. He felt that if he liked someone, being sincere to him was the most basic thing to do.Aunt Lan had a \u2018you\u2019re finally enlightened\u2019 expression and said happily, \u201cGreat. What do you want to cook? I\u2019ll get the kitchen staff to prepare the ingredients for you.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ll cook with whatever I see tomorrow.\u201d Shen Dai said a little embarrassedly, \u201cAunt Lan, actually, I would like to ask you to learn more about Moyu\u2019s preference, um\u2026 not only for food, but also for life. Habits, hobbies, tempers, and all.\u201d Aunt Lan had been serving Qu Moyu since childhood so who would know Qu Moyu better than her.\u201cThen I have too much to talk about.\u201d Aunt Lan smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s late tonight. You go to bed first and let\u2019s have a good chat tomorrow.\u201dShen Dai hasn\u2019t cooked for a long time. When he was a child, he liked to cook delicious food with his grandmother. He was born in a family with a strong artistic atmosphere. He was quite versatile, but he didn\u2019t have those leisurely feelings after he started working. When he was lying in bed and couldn\u2019t fall asleep, he flipped through the recipes, thinking about how Qu Moyu would react when he ate the breakfast he made, and he couldn\u2019t help but smile to himself.The next day, he got up an hour earlier, quickly prepared himself, and rushed to the kitchen. Qu Moyu prefers Chinese-style breakfast. But for a Chinese-style breakfast with rice noodles, the nutritionist has formulated a daily carbohydrate intake for him, and the ratio of carbohydrates, protein and vitamins in the morning should be within a general framework. He discussed with Aunt Lan and the chef first. In the end, he only made small shrimp wontons, fried eggs and boiled green vegetables. It was the first time for him to make breakfast for Qu Moyu. If he made some complicated food, it would be too deliberate. His thoughts were hidden like the wonton stuffing that he and his grandmother experimented making together.Qu Moyu is very self-disciplined. The process of getting up early every day will not exceed more than ten minutes. When he goes downstairs, Shen Dai is already prepared. When he saw Shen Dai, he was a little surprised: \u201cIf you don\u2019t leave for work now, are you not afraid of being late?\u201dShen Dai usually leaves half an hour earlier than Qu Moyu. His reason is that the commute time is long, but in fact, he rides a bicycle and transfers to the subway, which is no slower than Qu Moyu who is stuck in the morning rush hour. He just wanted to spare the embarrassment of having breakfast together at the end.\u201cFortunately, I don\u2019t have to clock in.\u201d Shen Dai teased, \u201cThe boss won\u2019t deduct my salary, right?\u201dQu Moyu smiled: \u201cIt seems that I have to change the rules and regulations of the institute first.\u201d He glanced at the breakfast, and immediately realised that it was not made by his chef.\u201cI made it.\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s heart beat a little faster, but he pretended to be relaxed, \u201cI can\u2019t fall back asleep when I wake up in the morning, so I just want to cook something for myself. It\u2019s all home-cooked meals. I don\u2019t know if it suits your taste.\u201dWontons, fried eggs, and green vegetables are indeed the most common home-cooked meals. Compared with the delicious dishes that are elegantly arranged by the chef and were accurately calculated by the calorie, the arranged ordinary food lying in white porcelain noodle bowls and bone dishes have more of a \u2018homely\u2019 sense.Qu Moyu\u2019s heart trembled slightly. It was an indescribable feeling: \u201cWhat was the dish you cooked last time? It was delicious.\u201d\u201cShrimp and tofu pot.\u201d Shen Dai said immediately, unable to restrain his excitement, \u201cIf you like it, I\u2019ll make it for you again next time.\u201dQu Moyu glanced at Shen Dai with a light smile: \u201cOkay.\u201d\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.04.29\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s Note: Actually, this little fish Qu Moyu kinda lacked familial love from his own father and mother. He had so many expectations on him that\u2019s why I think he was emotionally underdeveloped. I think Sundae is the first person who made him feel like he belonged for the first time. A sense of home and a family. But of course, he doesn\u2019t realise this yet. Even in the current ongoing raw chapters, he is still dumb dumb but oh well, I\u2019m here for the dog blood anyway. -KPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 32": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShen Dai sat aside, peeking at Qu Moyu\u2019s reaction when he was eating wontons. Seeing his two eyebrows slightly raised and chewing slowly, he seemed satisfied.\u201cIs it delicious?\u201d Shen Dai asked softly.\u201cDelicious. This wonton is very fresh, what\u2019s in it?\u201d\u201cIn addition to shrimp and pork, mushrooms and seaweed are also added. When I was a child, I always experimented cooking delicious food with my grandmother and grandfather. Adding the seaweed was suggested by me.\u201d\u201cWhat else can you cook?\u201d\u201cThere should be a lot. I didn\u2019t cook much after I started working. I always like to cook before.\u201d Shen Dai couldn\u2019t help feeling sad when he thought of his colourful youth. The age of 20 was a watershed in his life. Before that, he had no real troubles. Although he didn\u2019t have a complete family, the love and tolerance of his grandmother and grandfather for him are not bad at all. They have devoted a lot of energy and money to cultivate him, give him a comfortable life and high-quality education, and even support him to develop any hobbies or interest, for fear of not being able to make up for it. He has no regrets for not having a responsible parent. After the age of 20, his only top priority in life is to make money.Today, when making wontons, Shen Dai briefly indulged in the good memories of the past. When he was young and ignorant, he fantasised about cooking and mixing delicious wine for his beloved, listening to music, playing games, watching exhibitions, and exercising together. He also dreamt about travelling, exchanging movies, art, literature or the funny variety show he just watched. Influenced by his grandmother and grandfather, he was very good at discovering and finding beautiful details in life. Whether it is a flower, a painting, or a set of tea sets\u2026 They all can be aesthetically appreciated for half a day. But now he seems to have lost that ability. But in this moment when he finally doesn\u2019t have to worry about his livelihood, he wants to try to get that ability again.\u201cVery good. I will try your dishes when I have time.\u201dThe corner of Shen Dai\u2019s mouth lifted slightly. He lowered his head and took a bite of the wonton, thinking that it was the best wonton he had ever eaten.After breakfast, Qu Moyu asked Shen Dai to ride to work with his car. On the road, he told Shen Dai that he needed to cooperate with him to hand over some assets after the New Year.He has an M&amp;A case that has been negotiated for about a year. Only now there has finally been substantial progress. This was also agreed with Shen Dai at the beginning, and he was required to cooperate with them to advance their work at certain points. As for what he is supposed to do, Shen Dai never asked about it. However, he doesn\u2019t understand anything about the capital market, so he will just follow orders. Now he finally has the opportunity to ask, \u201cWhat am I going to do specifically?\u201d\u201cTo put it simply, You Xinghai wants to transfer high-quality assets such as prospecting and mining rights to a subsidiary company and divide the debts. You will replace the current legal representative, that is, by transferring the company to your name. Our marriage relationships actually have little legal significance for mergers and acquisitions, not to say that there are no restrictions at all, but only limited impact. It is a foundation of trust and with this foundation, everyone can go on with more confidence in future work.\u201dShen Dai nodded knowingly. What he understood was that he would be an intermediary. He is a credit guarantee for a third party to facilitate this transaction. The 10 million yuan could be counted as his intermediary fee. He thought to himself, with such a big merger, his intermediary fee was too low.\u201cThen after you get those qualifications, will you take all of You Xinghai\u2019s mines?\u201dQu Moyu shook his head: \u201cI will keep one or two at most and sell the others or seek external cooperation. Otherwise, we can\u2019t bear the cost. Moreover, there are several mines that have not been developed for a long time. They also do not meet the national land resource planning or environmental protection standards. For similar reasons, it is likely to be withdrawn by the government. There is too much work to be done and the cost performance is too low to be carried out.\u201d\u201cIf you will only keep one or two, I suggest keeping the one in Taklimakan. During my internship, the teacher took us to visit several domestic mines. That mine is our best evaluation.\u201d\u201cWell, we have made a preliminary assessment. It belongs to an A-level. After the merger, we will do in-depth research.\u201d Qu Moyu glanced at Shen Dai, \u201cHow about if I let you evaluate it?\u201dShen Dai was stunned for a moment: \u201cI\u2019m not professional in the assessment. It involves geological exploration.\u201d\u201cMore than that, if you decide to do this mine, you need to explore not only the mine, but also the surrounding environment. After the exploration is completed, the investment and construction side will make a phased exploration and mining plan for me. You will be responsible for evaluating the exploitability of the mineral resources, as well as level and commercial value. This is a job that requires the collaboration of many talents and I think you can lead the team.\u201dQu Moyu is giving him a chance. If this job is done well, it will greatly improve his career. The knowledge and data gained during this period are enough for him to publish one or two more research articles.Shen Dai has never missed every important opportunity in his life, he said firmly, \u201cI want to try it.\u201dQu Moyu looked at Shen Dai with a smile in his eyes. He admired people with an enterprising and adventurous spirit. Few omegas have such a daring energy for challenges. He said: \u201cYou remember the last time you saw Yan Mingxiu?\u201d\u201cRemember.\u201d Shen Dai felt a little embarrassed.\u201cWe spent 200 million to customise a new primary screening line from Longke Heavy Industry, which is already in the testing stage. It is at least 34% more efficient than the primary screening system of the Gansu mine. But there is currently no suitable product in China. I hope to get an ideal mine from You Xinghai and put this primary screening system on the ground.\u201d\u201cUnderstood. If I can have this opportunity, I will not let you down.\u201dQu Moyu nodded in satisfaction. The more he gets along with Shen Dai, the more he discovers his advantages. He intends to cultivate Shen Dai, not because he is his bed partner or simply because he is a useful person. A bed that can be dismissed by small favour and kindness. Only a faint-hearted gentleman will use the company\u2019s interests as a favour. But Shen Dai is different. A technical talent as a person that belonged to him will help him a lot and may even become his backbone in the future. In the past, he would never allow private affairs to be mixed with public affairs but they already had an intimate relationship. And Shen Dai just had the value he needed, and he could completely control him, so he might as well cultivate this person.When they arrived at the company\u2019s basement parking lot, Shen Dai looked out the window, determined that no one was around, and planned to get out of the car.\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Qu Moyu stopped him.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cYou just wanna leave like that?\u201d Qu Moyu raised his chin slightly, with a bewitching smile in his eyes, \u201cYou won\u2019t see me until the next day.\u201dHearing this, Shen Dai didn\u2019t realise that Qu moyu was flirting. Lao Wu had already opened the door and got out of the car very wisely.Qu Moyu patted his leg. Shen Dai\u2019s heart beat faster and moved himself over. He was wearing shoes so he was afraid of dirtying the seat. He could only kneel on his side on Qu Moyu\u2019s lap and hugged Qu Moyu by the neck.\u201cLet me smell you.\u201d Qu Moyu supported Shen Dai\u2019s waist and felt the narrow and powerful waist twist gently in his palm.Shen Dai obediently turned his neck and presented his life gate to his alpha without reservation.Qu Moyu put the tip of his tall nose against Shen Dai\u2019s pheromone sticker, sniffed the faint fragrance of the ephemeral flowers, and smelled more of the omega pheromones that were deliberately released at him. Aggressively living in a corner, he needed to concentrate on smelling the fragrance that can only be tasted at a close distance. It is extraordinarily delicious. Not to mention that when this omega is in heat, the fragrance of the flowers will burst out, and the fragrance will make people want to do things. He asked, \u201cIt\u2019s almost spring. You should be in heat soon.\u201dShen Dai said awkwardly, \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d\u201cNot sure?\u201d\u201cWell, mine does not always come on time. The number of times is less than normal.\u201d\u201cAre you really not going to check your glands?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s good and easier this way.\u201d\u201cBut I like you in heat.\u201d Qu Moyu suddenly nibbled on Shen Dai\u2019s neck, not more than an inch away from the gland.Shen Dai let out a low moan and his body couldn\u2019t help curling up. It was not because of pain but because Qu Moyu\u2019s act of biting his neck was too symbolic to the act of marking. It was difficult to calm down.Qu Moyu pinched his chin and kissed his lips forcefully, as if he was thinking about something that Shen Dai can\u2019t comprehend: \u201cYou are strong enough when you are in heat.\u201dFor an alpha who refuses to give a mark, the omega\u2019s heat period is a feast of indulgence. At this time, the omega who was arrogant will become obedient. It can give the alpha great physical and psychological satisfaction. But for a crazy desire to be marked, for an unacceptable omega, it is a period of loss of civilization, return to the primitive, and forced to surrender to the pain and pleasure of carnal desire.When Qu Moyu said these words, Shen Dai could only reply with silence. He knew that Qu Moyu thought that he was \u2018not strong enough\u2019.Qu Moyu didn\u2019t notice Shen Dai\u2019s mood. He bit Shen Dai\u2019s ear and smiled softly: \u201cDuring the annual leave, I\u2019ll take you to wherever you want to go and let you get in heat once. I want you to have a good rest and I will do you a good job.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s face suddenly heated up: \u201cI, I want to go to South Africa\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go to South Africa.\u201d\u201cI mean I want to go to that mine in South Africa\u2026\u201d\u201cThere will be time for that later.\u201d Qu Moyu pinched Shen Dai\u2019s waist, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go to work.\u201dShen Dai got out of the car in a panic. He straightened his slightly messy clothes and hair, and ran towards the public elevator without daring to turn to look back.Qu Moyu didn\u2019t think about what the heat period meant to him. He would suffer because he couldn\u2019t get the alpha\u2019s mark, but so what? Qu Moyu wouldn\u2019t think about him in the first place. But he no longer feels hurt easily. When he decides to take action this time, all the difficulties and obstacles he encounters along the way are within his expectations. He will not give up easily-unless what he encounters are far beyond what he could bear.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.05.02\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s Note: \u201cMergers and acquisitions (often abbreviated as M&amp;A) are some of the splashiest business decisions, often due to the large size of the deals and ability to quickly shake up market share\u201d (https://www.rocketblocks.me/blog/).Taklimakan Desert is somewhere in Uyghur.\u2018Not strong enough\u2019 for Shen Dai means he thinks he is not qualified for Qu Moyu because he is not an S-class Omega. *Sigh*There has been a debate for some time on Weibo where some fans guessed that our Sundae is actually an S-class Omega because his glands are not fully developed. I also suspect the same thing. But so far, in the raw chapters, there has been no confirmation yet to this suspicion of ours. If it\u2019s true, wouldn\u2019t our Squid suffer more blows??? I think it\u2019s interesting if it\u2019s true. -KPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn the day his grandmother was discharged from the hospital, Cheng Zimei also came to help. Shen Dai didn\u2019t have many friends, so he just called her to tell her that they will be going home today to celebrate grandmother\u2019s discharge and to do house warming.In the past two months, Shen Dai squeezed out all of his spare time to decorate the new house. From the sofa to the\u00a0 refrigerator to the small paper boxes, all of which were carefully selected by him. He decorated it according to the colours and styles of their previous home. A warm and beautiful home.His grandmother had come here only once when it was being renovated. She couldn\u2019t hide her excitement and surprise as soon as she entered the house. She walked all over from room to room. When she saw the silk bedding in her bedroom, she carefully sat down and gently moved with her hands to caress the silky and warm satin.This set of bedding was bought before the accident at home. In Shen Dai\u2019s impression, it was very expensive. It seemed to cost several thousand dollars. The concept of consumption instilled in him by his grandmother and grandfather since he was a child was to buy high-quality things. Good quality things do not necessarily come from famous brands. It is also not necessarily expensive. But it must have a good sense of use and safety, making life healthier and more comfortable. So there are no luxury cars or luxury goods at home, but once in a while, he will buy three hundred yuan of towels or a thousand-dollar worth of mahogany chopsticks.What puzzled Shen Dai was that with the same set of education methods and a similar outlook on money, Shen Qin seemed to be ignorant of the sufferings of the world. He spent money without planning and was reckless of the consequences. He did this while he was sober, And it may be because in his subconscious, since he was a child, he has resisted becoming a person like Shen Qin, so he used all the words and deeds of this person as a negative teaching material. Back then, he refused to listen to Shen Qin to study the art major of \u201cBetter Marry a Rich Man\u201d. He went to study materials science and even his grandmother and grandfather didn\u2019t quite understand it.\u201cAh Dai, you are very thoughtful.\u201d Grandma sighed: \u201cThis set is made of pure silk and the material is very good. After moving to that apartment, I was not willing to take it out once.\u201d\u201cI know you don\u2019t want to use it in the rented house. Now, this is our own house. We can use some good things that were left from the past.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so happy. I think life is finally getting better.\u201d Grandma looked at Shen Dai with tears in her eyes, \u201cThe debt is paid off. My surgery is done. Your job is going well. You have a house. And even your father had returned to admit that he was wrong. Everything is getting better and better, don\u2019t you think so?\u201dIf it wasn\u2019t for Shen Qin\u2019s sudden return, Shen Dai would have the same idea as his grandmother. But he was full of precautions and distrust of Shen Qin, for fear that his life that finally turned around would be ruined again. But at this time, how could he say no? He didn\u2019t have the heart to disappoint his grandmother. Of course, he also hoped that everything would get better and better.At this time, Shen Qin called him from the living room.Shen Dai walked over. Shen Qin frowned and asked, \u201cAh Dai, are there only two rooms here? Where do I sleep?\u201d\u201cThis house is small.\u201d Shen Dai pointed to the sofa in the living room, \u201cThat\u2019s a sofa bed. You can sleep here at night and put it away during the day.\u201dShen Qin\u2019s face changed immediately: \u201cYou let your dad sleep on the sofa?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think that there would be a third person in the family when I rent it.\u201d Shen Dai said indifferently, \u201cJust make do for now.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t we change to a bigger house? This is the living room\u2026\u201d Shen Qin said aggrievedly, \u201cHow can I sleep in the living room? There is no privacy at all. I\u2019m not an outsider, so how can I sleep on the sofa in the living room?\u201d\u201cThis house is very cost-effective. The rent has been paid for several months, and it will not be changed in the short term.\u201dShen Qin said sadly, \u201cI\u2019m in my late fifties. My waist is not good and my physique is weak. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll fall ill when I sleep on the sofa.\u201dCheng Zimei, who was preparing meals in the kitchen, stuck her head out and said with a smile: \u201cUncle, this sofa bed has the same function as a bed. Many people sleep there. How can you exaggerate? Everyone wants to live in a big house. Ah Dai used to live in a big house, isn\u2019t that big house gone now?\u201dShen Qin\u2019s face turned even uglier. He pursed his lips and was speechless.Although seeing Shen Qin\u2019s shrivelled expression was somewhat fulfilling, Shen Dai felt more sadness in his heart. He also missed the home where he grew up, but it was the person in front of him who complained that the house was too small was the one who sold the old house.\u201cGo and accompany grandma.\u201d Shen Dai had no intention of continuing this topic. He also did not want to see Shen Qin\u2019s speechless face very much , \u201cZimei, let\u2019s go and prepare dinner together.\u201dBack in the kitchen, Cheng Zimei rolled her eyes exaggeratedly and said in a low voice, \u201cHe\u2019s not satisfied with eating and living without paying anything.\u201dShen Dai silently shook his head. Today is a very good day. He doesn\u2019t want to be unhappy. He can see that Shen Qin has no money. But he can\u2019t make all the squeamish problems heal without medicine.The two were busy in the kitchen for a while when Shen Qin came over, still looking a little depressed: \u201cAh Dai, grandma asked you to come over. She said she wanted to find a dress. I\u2019ll deal with things here.\u201dAfter Shen Dai left, Cheng Zimei continued to cut vegetables calmly, not afraid of embarrassment at all.Shen Qin looked at Cheng Zimei several times, and he was hesitant to say anything. Obviously, he had something to say. Cheng Zimei pretended not to see it. She wants to see if he dared to provoke first.After holding it in for a while, Shen Qin said, \u201cXiao Cheng, you are Ah Dai\u2019s best friend. Can my uncle ask you something?\u201dCheng Zimei was overjoyed. She began to prepare her nerves for battle. She said cheerfully, \u201cAsk away, uncle.\u201d\u201cAh Dai\u2019s boyfriend, how is he? What work does he do?\u201dCheng Zimei was stunned. She thought that Shen Qin would at least ask how much Shen Dai\u2019s monthly salary was. But when that question came up, she didn\u2019t expect it. She was stunned and opened her mouth as soon as she heard it.\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d Shen Qin was also a little surprised, \u201cYou don\u2019t know about Ah Dai\u2019s alpha?\u201dCheng Zimei blinked: \u201cAh Dai has an alpha? I really don\u2019t know about this. How did you know?\u201d She suddenly panicked. Logically, if Shen Dai really wanted to hide something, then it\u2019s even more impossible to tell Shen Qin about it. But why doesn\u2019t she know about this? While Shen Qin knows? She was just dazed and upset.\u201cIn the hospital that day, I saw him walking out with an alpha holding hands and getting into a Rolls-Royce Phantom together.\u201d\u201cFuck!\u201d Cheng Zimei yelled. But she immediately covered her mouth when she realised the gaffe. But her big eyes were wide and she kept wandering around.\u201cDo you know who that alpha is?\u201d Shen Qin immediately caught the information from her reaction, \u201cIt was dark at the time and it was a little far away. So I couldn\u2019t see his face, but he was tall and wearing a suit, so he should be very young. .\u201d\u201cWhat colour of the car?\u201d\u201cBlack.\u201dCheng Zimei already had the answer in her heart. She had an intersection with Shen Dai and the car was a luxury car worth tens of millions. Based on these two points, she could be 100% sure that it was the crown prince of their Xingzhou. She was just too surprised. That day, Qu Moyu came to the institute and deliberately picked on Shen Dai\u2019s thorns during the meeting. After that, he went to Shen Dai\u2019s office alone. In addition to the scandal caused by the surveillance video, it was only three years ago that only a few people knew about the accident that happened between them. The fate of a pair of young and single alpha and omega has advanced to this point. It seems logical that something will eventually happen.But after all, he\u2019s the crown prince, the arrogant S-class alpha, the man who is obsessed with his career, never has any scandals, and has ruthlessly fired the top omega who pursues him without affecting his work. When she encouraged Shen Dai, she was just joking. For ordinary people, that person seemed to live in the clouds, out of reach.If she didn\u2019t hear it from Shen Qin\u2019s mouth, she couldn\u2019t even believe it. She was so excited that she wanted to grab Shen Dai and ask him clearly.\u201cWho the hell is that alpha?\u201d Shen Qin\u2019s eyes flickered, obviously excited.\u201cHe\u2026\u201d Cheng Zimei woke up in time, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, uncle. Since Ah Dai didn\u2019t tell us, there must be reasons. We are best friends so I have to respect his decision. It\u2019s inconvenient for me to say.\u201dShen Qin said anxiously: \u201cUncle is worried about him. Ah Dai is a very simple person. He has been studying since he was a child. He has a boyfriend now. As his father, I also hope to help him check his boyfriend\u2019s background.\u201d\u201cI think Ah Dai is fine. He is going to be a graduate Ph.D. student soon. So he won\u2019t be deceived by an alpha as easily as an ordinary omega.\u201d Cheng Zimei sneered in her heart;\u00a0A person who was so blinded by an alpha wanted to check on others? What a joke.Shen Qin naturally heard her insinuation but he was not angry. He instead smiled, with a glimmer of light in his eyes: \u201cYou are right. I believe Ah Dai can take care of himself. Anyway, that alpha looks young and promising. I hope he is a good man and treats my son well.\u201dCheng Zimei didn\u2019t have the heart to listen to what he had to say. Her brain was still shaking, and she was thinking about how to get Shen Dai to confess to her.That night, the four of them ate their first meal together after moving to a new house, cut cakes, and drank white wine. The atmosphere was warm and happy for a while. Even Shen Dai\u2019s gaze at Shen Qin became less indifferent. He hoped that Shen Qin had really changed his ways. It is so that he could tolerate his small problems such as spending money, hypocrisy, and selfishness based on the concept of \u2018supporting his parents as a filial son\u2019. In any case, the day ahead will always go in the best possible direction.Shen Dai took a picture of the food on the table and sent it to Qu Moyu:\u00a0My grandmother was discharged from the hospital today and we moved to a new house. So we celebrated. Except for the crucian carp tofu soup, I made the rest of the dishes.After a while, Qu Moyu replied:\u00a0Congratulations.Shen Dai snickered. Being able to share some ordinary joy in life with the person he likes, and getting a response is a kind of joy in itself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 34": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayUnder Cheng Zimei\u2019s sharp gaze, Shen Dai couldn\u2019t tell a lie or hide anymore. Besides, what he is more worried about now is not that the secret between him and Qu Moyu has been leaked. But Shen Qin is asking Cheng Zimei about Qu Moyu.Seeing Shen Dai\u2019s stiff face, Cheng Zimei gave him a step: \u201cSo, you signed a non-disclosure agreement? You have been together for a long time?\u201dShen Dai didn\u2019t know how to answer. What kind of \u2018together\u2019 did he and Qu Moyu count for? They were married, but it wasn\u2019t the kind of \u2018together\u2019 that Cheng Zimei imagined.Cheng Zimei thought he had accepted defeat and said in surprise, \u201cWhen did you two get together? Don\u2019t tell me since three years ago\u2026\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Shen Dai sighed deeply, \u201cZimei, I will tell you everything now. After you listen, you will know why I have to hide from you and lie to you.\u201d There is no point in hiding it now.Cheng Zimei couldn\u2019t help straightening her waist and sat upright. From Shen Dai\u2019s expression, she analysed that this was not a love story suitable for gossip. No one would be so serious when sharing love with their best friend.\u201cYou only know that I came from a single-parent family. My alpha father abandoned my omega dad and me when I was very young. But I didn\u2019t tell you who he was.\u201d Shen Dai instinctively said about the name he was about to mention. Disgusted, so he raised his eyebrows slightly, \u201cHis name is You Xinghai.\u201dCheng Zimei suddenly opened her mouth: \u201cChairman of Chuanghai Mining? You Baiyue\u2019s alpha father?\u201dShen Dai nodded: \u201cYou Xinghai gave me the money for repaying the debt and buying the house, because he needed me\u2026 in place of You Baiyue, to marry Qu Moyu.\u201dPerhaps it was due to the agony and confusion that had accumulated for too long, Shen Dai originally wanted to keep it short, but as soon as the seal was torn open, he couldn\u2019t help but tell everything that had happened in the past six months. He no longer could conceal it. He talked a lot about the details of getting along with Qu Moyu. But he knew that his emotions had been accurately conveyed to Cheng Zimei, because he watched Cheng Zimei\u2019s expression switch from shock to excitement to frown, and finally, when he finished speaking, the two people were silent together.Cheng Zimei, who can usually talk non-stop, took a long time to finally say, \u201cLet me digest it.\u201dShen Dai looked at his phone: \u201cThe lunch break is almost over. Let\u2019s go back to work.\u201dToday at noon, Cheng Zimei insisted on taking him to the commercial plaza opposite the company to have dinner, just to \u2018interrogate\u2019 him alone instead of eating in the cafeteria where their juniors would frequent.\u201cNo hurry. We can go back later.\u201d Cheng Zimei called the waiter, \u201cBring me a bottle of wine.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of wine are you drinking when you\u2019re still at work?\u201d Shen Dai sighed, \u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201dCheng Zimei looked at Shen Dai without blinking: \u201cI told you to try chasing the crown prince before, but it was just a joke. I know you don\u2019t have the guts, obviously Zhou Lan is more suitable for you. I\u2026 I really didn\u2019t expect you and the crown prince\u2026 holy mother-.\u201d She held her head, \u201cNow sitting across from me is actually the crown prince of Xingzhou\u2019s concubine. You actually went to bed with Qu Moyu. That\u2019s Qu Moyu. Ah! Holy mother of fuck, you have become a stranger that I know best.\u201dShen Dai said with a wry smile: \u201cIt\u2019s just a contract relationship. When the merger between Xingzhou and Chuanghai is over, we will divorce.\u201d\u201cBut you have slept now. This relationship is not just on contract. No wonder you asked me how to get the S-class alpha that day.\u201d Cheng Zimei still seemed to be unable to accept the truth, \u201cAh Dai, I want to confess to you. I was only bragging that day. I\u2019ve handed in two alphas in my life, but I really don\u2019t know how to get an S-class alpha. They don\u2019t seem to be of the same species as us. The only S-class alpha I\u2019ve really come into contact with is Professor Yu from HKUST. But then how old was I at the time. Besides that, I have hardly spoken to any S-class alpha\u2026\u201d She suddenly stared straight at Shen Dai, \u201cHow did you get along with the crown prince, weren\u2019t you afraid?\u201d\u201cI was scared at first.\u201d Shen Dai thought for a while, and said with some frustration, \u201cActually, I am also scared now.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s right to be afraid. Who can get along with the S-class alpha calmly\u2026 It\u2019s like accompanying a tiger. But who can resist the charm of the S-class alpha as well\u2026\u201d Cheng Zimei sighed and shook her head, looking at Shen Dai\u2019s eyes with a hint of sympathy, \u201cThe crown prince walks around the company every day. I don\u2019t know how many sexual fantasies had been triggered by people. It\u2019s normal for you to like him.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pity he doesn\u2019t like me.\u201d\u201cBrother, if you have slept with him, you will earn his love. And if you sleep with him more than once, you will earn more than that.\u201d Cheng Zimei patted Shen Dai\u2019s hand, \u201cI support you in your decisions. No matter if you really want to pursue him or if you think it\u2019s okay to maintain the status quo, I only have one piece of advice for you, that is, don\u2019t have expectations of him. I know you too well. I don\u2019t want you to be too invested and get hurt in the end.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Shen Dai said that he understood, but he actually didn\u2019t know what he understood. No matter how much he understood, he still liked him. But he still couldn\u2019t control the heart that wanted to get closer to Qu Moyu and get his love requited.If you like someone, how can you have no expectations?Cheng Zimei comforted: \u201cBut don\u2019t be discouraged. No matter how powerful an S-class alpha is, he is still a person. You wait for me to study and research. There are many examples of ordinary people getting S-class alpha. You really have the best opportunity now. What a pity. I will try my best to help you. If you really become a crown princess, I will be your follower.\u201dBefore Shen Dai could answer, Cheng Zimei grabbed his hand. She said earnestly and firmly, \u201cWe need to have a stable mind. Just like when we engage in scientific research, we don\u2019t expect too much, but work hard.\u201dShen Dai couldn\u2019t help but smile: \u201cOkay. However, there is one thing that worries me more now.\u201d\u201cYour dad, right?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s fortunate that you didn\u2019t get caught by him at the time, but he asked you about it, it should not be simple.\u201d If Cheng Zimei had not been his friend for many years or if she would have known about his family\u2019s troubles, Shen Dai would be embarrassed to mention this kind of domestic ugliness to people, \u201cHe must be unable to hang out outside, or he won\u2019t be able to come back. Now, he doesn\u2019t have the money to maintain his extravagant expenses. I\u2019m really afraid that he will have a crooked mind.\u201d\u201cThen what should I do? If he really wants to find out the identity of the prince, it\u2019s not difficult. Didn\u2019t he follow you from the company to the hospital before?\u201dShen Dai frowned deeply: \u201cI\u2019ll observe him first.\u201dBecause of his precautions, Shen Dai would send a WeChat message to his grandmother every day when he was about to leave work, to inquire whether Shen Qin was at home or not. Fortunately, Shen Qin still cared about taking care of his grandmother, and did not go out for a long time for no reason. As the New Year is approaching, it is time for a holiday. Shen Dai has been busy with work from the previous year, and plans to have a good chat with Shen Qin after the Chinese New Year.When Shen Dai returned to Qu\u2019s house, it was almost eleven o\u2019clock. He had been working overtime recently and he hadn\u2019t seen Qu Moyu much for a week.As soon as he entered the door, Uncle Heng said to him, \u201cYou\u2019re working overtime again. Young master is waiting for you in the study. He has something to tell you.\u201d\u201cShould I go to the study?\u201d Shen Dai couldn\u2019t help but look up. In fact, he couldn\u2019t see the third floor from this angle, but it didn\u2019t prevent him from looking up psychologically. The third floor was a special existence for him because he never went up there. It was after all Qu Moyu\u2019s private territory and he was never allowed to set foot there.\u201cWell, the young master hasn\u2019t slept at this point. You can go up quickly.\u201dShen Dai went back to the room to put down his things and took the stairs upstairs. Even though it was such a short distance, he seemed to be heading towards an unknown area. Should he be happy? At least it meant that he was getting a little closer to Qu Moyu.Shen Dai stood in front of Qu Moyu\u2019s study and knocked lightly on the door.\u201cCome in.\u201dShen Dai opened the door and saw Qu Moyu was sitting at the desk in his pyjamas. There were several documents on the table. The backlight of the computer plated a grey-blue metallic light on his face, which complemented the texture. Transparent and cold, coupled with the perfect handsome face that seemed to be deliberately carved. It made him look unlike a real person.Qu Moyu raised his eyes and took a glance: \u201cYou came back so late and worked overtime again.\u201d\u201cWell, there were a lot of things going on from a few years ago.\u201d Shen Dai walked over and said softly, \u201cAren\u2019t you working overtime too? Are you tired?\u201dHearing this, Qu Moyu put down the pen in his hand and raised his head: \u201cFortunately, we can rest after this time.\u201dShen Dai smiled: \u201cUncle Heng said you have something to tell me.\u201d\u201cCome home with me for the New Year.\u201dShen Dai was stunned.\u201cMy grandfather\u2019s health has gotten bad recently. When the family spends the New Year together this year, he wants to see his grandson-in-law.\u201d\u201cOkay, what should I prepare?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous. Just play your role.\u201dQu Moyu said that his grandfather didn\u2019t want to see the two cousins fighting against each other, so the reason for the two to get married was for \u2018the love for each other\u2019, at least in front of his grandfather.Shen Dai nodded: \u201cI will.\u201d\u201cWe stayed at home until the second year of the semester. I took you to South Africa for vacation in the third year of semester. When it comes to the mine, we will just go investigate together.\u201d Qu Moyu took Shen Dai\u2019s hand, and Shen Dai also took advantage of the situation to go around the desk and sat on his lap\u201cOkay.\u201d Shen Dai hesitated, \u201cBut if we go together, won\u2019t people know about it?\u201d\u201cI will arrange for a secret inspection. Just ask Professor Liu to bring one or two people to conduct them.\u201d Qu Moyu raised his hand and tore off Shen Dai\u2019s pheromone sticker and sniffed the back of his neck. When the two are alone, they must always go through this process.Shen Dai thought that his mentor was going to find out about their relationship and couldn\u2019t help feeling a little embarrassed. What would his mentor think of him?Qu Moyu inhaled the elegant scent of epiphyllum into his nose and felt like the fatigue of the whole day was relieved. He put his arms around Shen Dai\u2019s narrow waist and whispered: \u201cProfessor Liu intends to cultivate you. This is a good thing. After this time, he will value you more. Your title, your thesis and PhD\u2019s future topics and funding, I will support them all.\u201dShen Dai stared at Qu Moyu with wide eyes. He was stunned for a while, not knowing what to say.Qu Moyu looked at him with a smile, waiting patiently for his response.Shen Dai opened his mouth and stuttered: \u201cWhy, why\u2026 You, you don\u2019t have to be so nice to me.\u201d\u201cYou are my wife.\u201d Qu Moyu said with a light smile.Shen Dai felt that all of his heart was held in Qu Moyu\u2019s hand. The hot, warm and throbbing heart jumped with Qu Moyu\u2019s words, deeds, frowns and smiles. There are many moments in their relationship where Qu Moyu\u2019s kindness and tenderness to him made him extremely restrained but sinking deeper step by step. Even if Qu Moyu said frankly and confidently that he was going to marry an S-class omega who could give birth to an S-class heir for him, he would still be willing to give his full love to the flirtation that meant \u2018you are my wife\u2019\u2026He had no way of resisting Qu Moyu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although the lawyer said that there are still many steps to go before the successful merger, Shen Dai still feels that this is way more efficient. Since the original agreement stated that the maximum duration of their marriage was five years, he naturally assumed that it would take at least a few years and now it seems that it may be completed by next year. At that time, they will no longer need to continue this marriage relationship. It is only necessary for Qu Moyu to break it off.Shen Dai knew that it was useless to worry about it. But he wanted to make Qu Moyu like him too. Because \u2018the time was tight and the task was heavy\u2019, and he couldn\u2019t see any possibility.On the 29th day of the twelfth lunar month, Shen Dai went home and had dinner with his grandma. He said that he was going to South Africa on business and could not celebrate the New Year at home. This was only half-truth.After dinner, while Shen Qin went to wash the dishes, Shen Dai walked into the kitchen: \u201cI just transferred money to you to buy more delicious food for the New Year. I will be on a business trip for at least ten days this time, so you must take care of it. Be a good son. Don\u2019t forget the appointment at the hospital several times for re-examination. If grandma needs anything, let me know at any time.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Shen Qin glanced at Shen Dai and said in a low voice, \u201cYou still won\u2019t call me Dad.\u201dShen Dai didn\u2019t answer directly, and added: \u201cI hope you don\u2019t ask me about my affairs. I can handle my own life, you just need to take care of my grandma. I will let you live a good old life, but there will be no relationship or connections between us.\u201dShen Qin\u2019s hand stopped from washing the dishes. He looked at Shen Dai without blinking, his beautiful almond eyes gradually turning red: \u201cIf your father is capable, I would like to treat you well. And I would like to treat all the people in the world well. I will give you all the best things.\u201dShen Dai shook his head, unmoved: \u201cI have had no expectations from you since a long time ago. But at least I don\u2019t hate you anymore, as long as you don\u2019t cause us any more trouble.\u201dHe believed what Shen Qin said, if Shen Qin was rich, he would not be stingy with them. He also received expensive toys and clothes bought by Shen Qin when he was a child. But Shen Qin loves himself more than anything else. He only has enough to eat in all of his life choices. This person always chooses himself, even if it will hurt the closest person to him.In Shen Qin\u2019s heart, he is not a precious child or a person who he unconditionally loved. The highest value of his existence was to coerce You Xinghai, whether it is for love or money. When he could not get that easy life, the burden was thrown to Shen Dai\u2019s grandmother and grandfather.He no longer hated Shen Qin, nor did he forgive him. The only thing left between them was the duty to support the family.On New Year\u2019s Eve, Lao Wu sent him and Qu Moyu to the mountain, where the old man of the Qu family was recuperating.On the way, Shen Dai got a general understanding of the Qu family\u2019s family structure. Grandpa Qu has two alpha sons, a beta daughter and an omega son. Beta and omega are not qualified to inherit the family business. They have already married off early. This year, the whole family will be back, because according to the doctor\u2019s judgement, this is likely to be the last Spring Festival for Grandpa Qu.Qu Moyu thought of something and smiled: \u201cSpeaking of which, because of you this year, I can serve tea to respect the elders as a grandchild for the first time.\u201dShen Dai looked at him quizzically.\u201cMy uncle is the eldest son. He has always been the first to serve tea. By the way, he brought his own children to serve tea together. My parents and I can only be ranked second. After all, I am not the eldest grandchild, and now I am married and have a family of our own. When our sons and daughters are finished paying respects, it will be our turn first.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s head was a little dizzy. He couldn\u2019t imagine that a big family in modern society would still be so feudal, and Qu Moyu was so competitive that he had to compete with Qu Chengchen even for this. He really couldn\u2019t understand. He asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t Qu Chengchen call you eldest brother, aren\u2019t you the eldest grandchild?\u201d\u201cNo, no, we still have an older alpha sister.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of this.\u201d If the Qu family still has an elder alpha, she should be in an important position in Xingzhou now. As an old employee of Xingzhou, why did he never know there was such a person?\u201cShe\u2019s dead.\u201d Qu Moyu said flatly.\u201cUh\u2026\u2026\u201dQu Moyu slowly turned his head out of the window, looking at the scenery that was passing by in a hurry, obviously he didn\u2019t want to continue talking about this topic.The manor where Grandpa Qu lives now is a small nursing home. The ramps, handrails, sound insulation devices, and low-saturation lights that can be seen everywhere, which are all especially customised for the elderly. According to Qu Moyu, there is even a medical team here.\u201cLet\u2019s go see my parents first.\u201dQu Moyu found Qu Shen who was reading a book in the living room. When Qu Shen saw them, he nodded: \u201cYou\u2019re here. How was the road? Safe?\u201dThis road up the mountain was covered with snow that would not melt and it was really slippery.\u201cLao Wu drove very slowly.\u201d Qu Moyu asked; \u201cWhere\u2019s my mother?\u201dQu Shen glanced out the window: \u201cLooking at plum blossoms outside. It\u2019s such a cold day\u2026\u201d He looked at Shen Dai, \u201cGive her this blanket.\u201d\u201cOkay, Director Qu.\u201d Shen Dai picked up the blanket on the sofa and walked to the garden. Sure enough, Mrs. Qu was taking pictures of the plum blossom branches wrapped in silver frost with her mobile phone.Shen Dai\u2019s feet were crunching on the snow, but Mrs. Qu was very attentive, and her jade-white hands were obviously frozen red. She is still so beautiful and elegant, with graceful temperament, like a unique plum in the snow.Shen Dai shook off the blanket and said softly, \u201cMrs. Qu.\u201dMrs. Qu turned her face and smiled at Shen Dai: \u201cLook at how beautiful these plum blossoms are. Some flowers are so maverick, they can live well even without a warm climate.\u201d\u201cYeah, wear the blanket. Now, the snow is melting, it\u2019s too cold.\u201d Shen Dai draped the blanket over her shoulders.Mrs. Qu let out a breath of cold mist: \u201cIt\u2019s quite cold. You wear so little, let\u2019s go in.\u201dThe two entered the room, but Mrs. Qu was standing by the large French window and continued to admire the plums: \u201cI thought Mo Yu would not bring you back. New Year\u2019s Eve is the most boring time of the year.\u201d\u201cMo Yu said that the old man wants to see his grandson\u2019s wife.\u201d\u201cHe wants to see when you can give birth to an alpha for the Qu family.\u201d Mrs. Qu smiled, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know yet that your pheromone level is only B.\u201dShen Dai felt a little embarrassed, but could not leave the venue politely.\u201cDon\u2019t look at his age. In fact, he knows everything in his heart. He knows why Mo Yu married you, and he also knows that when he dies, the eldest and the second will definitely fight.\u201d Mrs. Qu\u2019s smile carried a sign of clear mocking, \u201cHe thinks he can press him while he is still alive. Now that he knows that his internal friction is not good, when he used to train his children as fighting beasts, isn\u2019t he still proud of his educational philosophy?\u201dShen Dai couldn\u2019t understand why Mrs. Qu was talking about this to an outsider like him, but then he thought about it, maybe it was because he was an outsider who had no interest in the family, and didn\u2019t have the courage to talk about the Qu family\u2019s affairs. But it was precisely because he was an outsider. He had participated in the story of the Qu family well and could understand the plot she explained, so he told himself that perhaps this wealthy lady had no better ways to vent her resentments.Yes. It was resentment. This is what Shen Dai felt from her about the Qu family\u2019s emotions. Even if she spoke in a soft tone, every word was thorny.Shen Dai knows that he himself is just a tool. Since Qu Moyu can use him, of course Qu Moyu\u2019s mother also had her use. He just wanted to know more about Qu Moyu\u2019s environment when he was growing up, so he entertained her and asked: \u201cWhy do you mean by what you\u2019ve said?\u201d His question was not directional, it could be said that it covered every word Mrs. Qu had said, giving her a lot of room to start.\u201cBecause my husband and my son grew up like this.\u201d Mrs. Qu stared at Shen Dai quietly, \u201cYou are a child of a normal family. You don\u2019t understand. Xiaoyue is worthy to be the daughter-in-law of the Qu family. You can\u2019t.\u201dShen Dai really had no way to refute this sentence, even on a psychological level.Mrs. Qu\u2019s eyes were gentle but sharp: \u201cI know you and Mo Yu had slept. Did you use contraceptives?\u201dShen Dai felt even more embarrassed, he nodded calmly: \u201cWe have an agreement. There will be no children.\u201d He paused and said, \u201cYou can rest assured.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for you.\u201d Mrs. Qu tightened the blanket and said lightly, \u201cIf you can\u2019t give birth to an S-class alpha, your children are of no value to the Qu family.\u201dThis sentence was too cold, and Shen Dai\u2019s heart trembled. He knew that it was impossible for Qu Moyu to have children with him, because he was just an omega with a low pheromone level which is only B-class. He would be very lucky to even give birth to an A-class alpha. The chance of giving birth to an S-class alpha was smaller than the chances of winning the lottery. The combination that will most likely to give birth to an S-class alpha is an S-class alpha and an S-class omega. The latter being the prerequisite for Qu Moyu\u2019s future wife. But he was still uncomfortable with the utilitarianism and contempt for life presented in it.\u201cIs the pheromone level that important?\u201d Shen Dai couldn\u2019t help but say the first half of the sentence, but he held back the second half of the sentence that he really wanted to say. He wanted to say that the weight of the judgement was placed on reproductive ability, and completely ignored the rest. As for the other abilities of an omega, he would not agree with this set of scoring criteria to classify himself as a lower-class person. But he realised that he should not discuss this issue with an elder, because the times are different, and the gap in cognition cannot be filled with words.\u201cOf course it\u2019s important, especially in the alpha world.\u201d Mrs. Qu sighed, \u201cYou know, Mo Yu actually had an elder alpha cousin, that is, Chengchen\u2019s older sister.\u201d\u201cHe mentioned it and said she was gone.\u201d\u201cShe was a very good girl. An A-level alpha. She was good enough originally, but unfortunately\u2026\u201d Mrs. Qu lowered her eyes and did not hide her sadness, \u201cHer tragedy started from the birth of Mo Yu and reached the peak after Chengchen was born.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026why?\u201d\u201cBecause she has two younger brothers who she can never compete with. Even if she works hard, the genetic gap cannot be filled. Although she is the eldest grandson of the eldest house, she can only take over the marginal business of Xingzhou. For an alpha who has high self-esteem, it is a devastating blow. No matter how lucky or rich outsiders see her, she can only live in low self-esteem and pain.\u201d Mrs. Qu gently pressed her forehead against the cold window, \u201cShe died of a drug overdose in San Francisco. She was younger than Mo Yu when she died.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOne after another, all the members of the Qu family have arrived. Some of them have been seen by Shen Dai before, but most of them are new faces. The four children of Grandpa Qu have each branched and scattered, and now they are the same for four generations. He can be called a prosperous person.Shen Dai sat quietly beside Qu Moyu, listening to him chatting with his relatives. Qu Moyu\u2019s parents were chatting with others on the other side, and Qu Chengchen was also there, playing games with a few relatives. There were two little children, laughing and running around in the living room, screaming from time to time. At this moment, this empty and quiet manor finally has some liveliness and vitality of a home.Suddenly, an alpha girl comes over. She looks like she\u2019s twelve or thirteen years old and she looks very beautiful. She greets the elders one by one politely and respectfully, looking like a little adult: \u201cCousin, Happy New Year. Cousin\u2019s wife, Happy New Year.\u201d\u201cRenren has grown taller again.\u201d Qu Moyu touched the girl\u2019s head and gave Shen Dai a wink.Shen Dai\u2019s lined pocket contained several red envelopes, all of which were prepared for the children here, and he handed them over: \u201cHappy New Year.\u201dRenren took the red envelope generously, looked at Shen Dai and said, \u201cThey said you graduated from the University of Science and Technology and are still working in the research institute. Did you graduate with a master degree? Or do you have a PhD?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m currently studying for my PhD.\u201dRenren nodded and quickly looked at Shen Dai for a round: \u201cIn the Youth Cup competition held by HKUST last summer, I won the national first prize in the mathematics group. I might be recommended to HKUST in the future. Of course, I also have other choices, what is your opinion? How is the campus life of HKUST?\u201dShen Dai was stunned by this girl\u2019s maturity, neatness, and confidence. Is this what an alpha cultivated by a wealthy family looks like?\u00a0The standard\u00a0is much higher than her peers. She was not shy at all, and was good at showing herself. Even if the elders gave him a red envelope, she would hide back awkwardly, and it was even more impossible to have such a smooth conversation and dominate the topic. He suddenly thought the story of Qu Moyu\u2019s elder alpha cousin. Of how high-spirited an alpha who was born in such a family would be, and how strong would the frustration of losing in the competition should be.Shen Dai smiled and said, \u201cI think it\u2019s very good. I don\u2019t know if it meets your requirements though.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know for now. I still fancy HKUST, but I\u2019m still young and my plans for the future are not fully formed yet.\u201d Renren also smiled at Shen Dai, \u201cGive me your WeChat. I can ask you if I have any questions in the future.\u201dAfter Renren left, several relatives praised her. Shen Dai leaned over to Qu Moyu and whispered, \u201cDid you do this when you were young?\u201dQu Moyu chuckled: \u201cIsn\u2019t it cute?\u201d\u201cCute.\u201d It is just that she matures more than her actual age.\u201cI\u2019m smarter than her though.\u201d Qu Moyu grabbed Shen Dai\u2019s hand under the table and squeezed it lightly.Shen Dai immediately twisted Qu Moyu\u2019s finger, the two of them had done all kinds of intimate things, but holding hands in front of others like this made his heart especially feel sweet. He hoped that the ambiguity and sweetness could last longer.Later, Grandpa Qu appeared. He was sitting in a wheelchair, his face was sallow and thin, his temples were white, his eyes were cloudy, and the backs of his two withered hands were covered with pinholes. He looked like he was in a bad condition.Shen Dai remembered the photo of him in his prime that he had seen on the company\u2019s exhibition wall. Grandpa Qu\u2019s entrepreneurial deeds, many thrilling nodes and ups and downs, all of which were talked about by people in the industry. This person in front of him is said to be a legendary figure, one of the veterans who promoted the vigorous development of the domestic rare earth industry, and has a contribution worthy of being recorded in history. It is a pity that sickness could easily destroy such a powerful entrepreneur.His sons and grandsons stood on either side in unison to greet him for the New Year.Grandpa Qu nodded: \u201cYou are all here. It\u2019s nice to have such a big family.\u201d\u201cDad, you look more energetic today.\u201d Qu Shen said with a smile.The nurse behind him said, \u201cMaster ate half a bowl of rice and several mouthfuls of vegetables today. He slept in the afternoon, saving enough energy to celebrate the New Year.\u201dThe crowd clapped happily.Grandpa Qu smiled: \u201cLook at you adults, nothing has changed. The children have grown up after three days of not seeing each other. Good, very good.\u201dThe nurse pushed him to the main seat of the table, and the others took their seats one by one and began to eat the New Year\u2019s Eve dinner.During the banquet, Grandpa Qu said a lot of things in a slow manner. He only mentioned a few things about the company. Most of them were instructions to his family. But some are his spoken regrets.After the meal, the descendants took turns to greet the old man for the New Year. Qu Chengchen\u2019s father was the eldest, and he brought his wife to offer tea for Grandpa Qu first. After they finished the toast, it was Qu Moyu\u2019s turn.Shen Dai approached the old man with Qu Moyu. He couldn\u2019t help but feel a little nervous. As early as the day of Xingzhou\u2019s internship, he wanted to see the true face of this legendary entrepreneur, but at that time,Grandpa Qu had already retired. This day, he had become the granddaughter-in-law of the Qu family, even though it was only temporary. The development history of Grandpa Qu and Xingzhou came to mind one by one. For the first time, he truly felt the huge energy of the Qu family, and he could clearly see the gap between him and Qu Moyu.The two held their teacups and bowed respectfully: \u201cHappy Chinese New Year, Grandpa.\u201dGrandpa Qu nodded and smiled. When he saw Qu Moyu, his expression became obviously cheerful. After all, this was the heir to the S-class alpha he most wanted.\u201cHow have you been at the company lately?\u201d\u201cEverything is fine, you can rest assured.\u201d\u201cPay attention to your body too.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMr. Qu looked at Shen Dai again: \u201cThey told me something about you. It\u2019s not easy for an omega to go for such a career, but now that you are married into our Qu family, you should try your best to put your family first and take good care of it until the end.\u201dShen Dai whispered: \u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cGive our Qu family a few more alphas earlier.\u201dShen Dai complied obediently, but felt helpless in his heart. The legendary figure suddenly lost the holy light behind him.Grandpa Qu gestured to the nurse behind him, and he said, \u201cThis is for our little greeting, you two have a good life.\u201d The nurse took out a red envelope and gave it to Shen Dai.\u201cThank you.\u201dAfter all the juniors paid New Year\u2019s greetings, Mr. Qu was tired and was pushed back to his room by the nurse to rest.Some people watched TV, some played cards, and some chatted while waiting for the New Year\u2019s bell to ring to complete the whole set of New Year\u2019s process.Qu Moyu was dragged by his elders to play cards, and Shen Dai took his mobile phone to the unoccupied living room and made a video call to his grandmother.The decoration here is European-style, which can just be disguised as a foreign hotel.His grandmother asked a lot of questions, worried about whether he would be comfortable in a foreign country, whether he was tired from flying and such. Shen Qin appeared on camera from time to time and reported to Shen Dai the menu of their New Year\u2019s Eve. On the other hand, Shen Dai looked at Shen Qin and felt that he looked a little more pleasing to the eye at the moment.After chatting for about half an hour, his grandmother was afraid that he would not be able to adjust to the time difference, so she hung up the phone to let him rest.When Shen Dai was about to go out, Qu Chengchen walked in. He didn\u2019t know whether he just entered the room or he had the intention to block himself from getting out. No matter which, Shen Dai immediately became alert.Qu Chengchen wanted to laugh a little: \u201cWhat are you nervous about? What can I do to you?\u201d\u201cYou have nothing nice to say every time we meet.\u201d Shen Dai said bluntly, \u201cWhat do you want to say this time?\u201d\u201cYou have thought wrongly of me too much.\u201d Qu Chengchen pouted innocently, \u201cI try to help you every time, but you keep rejecting my kindness.\u201dShen Dai frowned at him.Qu Chengchen took a few steps towards Shen Dai: \u201cWell\u2026 you smell like big brother.\u201dShen Dai wrinkled his nose subconsciously, but immediately realised that Qu Chengchen was testing him. When Qu Moyu didn\u2019t mark him or release pheromone to him deliberately, even if they were next to each other, the smell of pheromone would still be there and it would dissipate quickly.Qu Chengchen laughed twice: \u201cWhat I want to say\u2026 Just like last time, I will help you get the big brother\u2019s mark. That\u2019s what you wanted the most, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Shen Dai said coldly, \u201cI won\u2019t trust you and I won\u2019t be used by you. You might as well save some time and spend it on improving your performance.\u201d\u201cWhy do you have to be so repulsive? This is clearly a win-win situation.\u201d Qu Chengchen put his arms around his chest, \u201cDon\u2019t you want him to be your alpha?\u201d\u201cIt has nothing to do with you.\u201d\u201cDo you want him to be your alpha or not?\u201d Qu Chengchen\u2019s sharp eyes stared into Shen Dai\u2019s eyes.Under the powerful gaze of an S-class alpha, Shen Dai felt a little weak in his legs. He was watched by those eyes, and even lost the courage to argue or lie. He gritted his teeth and secretly clenched his fists: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I want. I will only fight for it the right way.\u201d\u201cThe right way?\u201d Qu Chengchen couldn\u2019t help laughing, \u201cUnder normal circumstances, my big brother would not be able to mark an omega who has no power, no background or even excellent genes. Maybe he likes you now, sleeps with you comfortably, and doesn\u2019t mind keeping you by his side, but that\u2019s about it. He will only give you some small favours. When the candidate for his matching wife appears, you can only stand by and watch him marry someone else. The right way? Isn\u2019t just yourself?\u201dShen Dai\u2019s heart was trembling with anger. Qu Chengchen made things difficult for him and humiliated him time and time again. The words he said were poignant, because they were true.\u201cBecause you have too few chips in your hand, you can only use a small, broad-minded, and the right way as a choice. As long as you get his mark, no matter what method you use, you will win more than half.\u201d Qu Chengchen blinked his eyes, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to try?\u201dShen Dai said coldly, \u201cHave you ever won against him in your life? Why do you think such a big event is something you can control.\u201d\u201cMy big brother is usually considered indestructible. We can hardly find any weakness, but he is also a person after all. No matter how powerful an S-class alpha is, he will be vulnerable like a child during the annual susceptible period.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s body froze for a moment. For an extremely brief moment, he noticed the trembling in his heartstrings, an emotion called temptation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 37": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQu Chengchen felt that he had achieved his goal in stages, left a meaningful smile and left. Shen Dai stood stiffly in place for a long time, unable to regain his senses.The susceptibility period\u2026 is indeed the most fatal weakness of an alpha. It mostly occurs in the warm spring and summer seasons, similar to the omega\u2019s estrus period, except that the alpha\u2019s needs are mating and marking. During this period, the alpha will degenerate to their animalistic instincts. They will become very dangerous and very fragile. If the alpha can go through the susceptible period with the omega he marked, it will be a sweet and satisfying time. Otherwise, it will be a torment.For S-class alphas, this is the easiest time to be exploited and backstabbed. So they\u2019ll find a place that\u2019s absolutely private and safe to get through this period.Shen Dai didn\u2019t expect Qu Chengchen to have such an idea, but it was indeed the only weakness of Qu Moyu he could think of. Qu Chengchen is right. This is the most likely chance for him to get Qu Moyu\u2019s mark, but what does he want such a mark? It wasn\u2019t a promise made to him by someone he loved with the intention of spending the rest of his life with him. It wasn\u2019t the mark that really mattered.He should find an opportunity to remind Qu Moyu, Shen Dai thought. He must be careful of this scheming Qu Chengchen. Maybe when Grandpa Qu was still alive, he didn\u2019t dare to make any big moves, but it would be hard to say in the future.As the countdown for New year was approaching, the Qu family gathered in the courtyard, waiting to set off firecrackers. A few children were running and jumping in the snow. The big red lanterns made their faces flushed red and they looked very happy.When Shen Dai was young, he didn\u2019t have relatives and playmates of the right age. It was his first time to celebrate New Year with so many people. Influenced by the lively atmosphere, he had a feeling that he was really a member of the family, even if it was only an illusion for a short time. He took a peek at the person beside him, his nominal husband, and silently hugged Qu Moyu\u2019s arm.Qu Moyu lowered his head to look at Shen Dai. Looking down from this angle, he could see his slender and upturned eyelashes and the straight bridge of his nose. He looked very obedient when he leaned slightly towards his head. Shen Dai seemed to have noticed something and raised his head. The eyes of the two people inadvertently collided. At this moment, when the old and current time clash, the person reflected in the eyes appears to have some special meaning. The hearts of both of them are beating violently at this moment.Shen Dai was always unable to look directly into Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes for a long time. When he liked someone, he would be shy involuntarily. He looked away and asked casually, \u201cDid you win at poker?\u201d\u201cI won a bit.\u201d Qu Moyu said, \u201cIf you say something nice to me tonight, I\u2019ll give you a big red envelope.\u201dShen Dai smiled and said, \u201cHappy Chinese New Year?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too vulgar.\u201d\u201cSo what else?\u201dQu Moyu lowered his voice: \u201cIt should be something that sounds nice.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s face tightened. He didn\u2019t know what to do. But then he was suddenly startled by the sound of crackling firecrackers.Fireworks cannot be set off in the mountains. The 10,000-ton firecrackers are enough to blow up the warm atmosphere of the new year. The screams of the children rose and fell. Shen Dai smiled and covered his ears. He silently made a New Year\u2019s wish in his heart.Back in the guest room, Shen Dai received the hint behind Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes: \u201cI\u2019m going to take a bath.\u201dQu Moyu held Shen Dai\u2019s shoulders, pulled him closer to him, and skillfully tore off the sticker on the back of his neck: \u201cShower together.\u201dThe rain fell from the shower overhead, shrouding the two in mist. The water temperature was high at this time, but the kiss that Qu Moyu left on Shen Dai\u2019s shoulder and neck was even hotter. Shen Dai\u2019s waist was wrapped around by Qu Moyu\u2019s arms. His back is against the hard and hot object of Qu Moyu\u2019s. His naked body trembled uncontrollably.When Qu Moyu pushed in fiercely, Shen Dai was squeezed against the wall. He was stuck in between the cold and hard tiles on his chest and the hot and thick chest on his back. With every fuck, he felt the extreme stimulation of two worlds of ice and fire.The surrounding area was quickly filled with white and misty heat, and Shen Dai\u2019s chin was pinched by Qu Moyu. They kissed for a long time and soon felt out of breath. His weak legs made him almost fall. Qu Moyu hugged his waist, dragged him out of the shower, and threw him onto the bed in the bedroom while he was still fucking him from behind.Shen Dai\u2019s voice was hoarse and tired, so he could only bury his face in the quilt and whimper softly. Qu Moyu didn\u2019t think it was enough, so he lowered his head and bit the white and tender flesh on the back of his neck. The glands were only an inch away from where he bit. This was not the first time he had bitten Shen Dai\u2019s neck. If he couldn\u2019t mark it, it meant he was not in absolute possession. He didn\u2019t know how many times he had the urge to bite down hard. Although rationality prevailed over desire every time, the taste of disobeying instinct was not pleasant. Often in the extreme pleasures, these heartbreaking dissatisfactions were interspersed. His unspeakable anger would be vented to Shen Dai even more intensely. After all, the person in his arms who made him almost out of control several times was the culprit.He has never been an indulgent person. On the contrary, he is very restrained in physical needs. Sexual desire needs self-discipline just like his appetite, but often when he has sex with Shen Dai, he will fuck him to the point of him unable to get out of bed the next day. It is hard to say whether it is intentional or not. But there must be some anger mixed in it. Because Shen Dai\u2019s existence provokes his self-control.Shen Dai didn\u2019t know how many twists and turns the alpha had in his heart at this time. He didn\u2019t know anything. He could only fall along with Qu Moyu\u2019s original desire.Shen Dai slept deeply, without the pressure of getting up early at work. He just wanted to relieve his exhaustion to the fullest in the warm bed on the first day of the new year.Until he was shaken awake by Qu Moyu.Shen Dai looked at Qu Moyu with a serious face, and then looked out the window. It was cloudy and snowy, and he couldn\u2019t tell what time it was.\u201cGet up and get dressed.\u201d\u201cWhat time, what time is it? Did I sleep until late?\u201d Shen Dai saw that Qu Moyu\u2019s face was bleak. He couldn\u2019t help thinking that he might have done something wrong.Qu Moyu lowered his eyes and said solemnly, \u201cMy grandfather passed away in the morning.\u201dShen Dai couldn\u2019t process the information for a long time.\u201cGet dressed!\u201dShen Dai endured the pain all over his body. He got out of bed and hurriedly dressed. After almost tripping over his pants, his chaotic brain woke up like a dream and understood what Qu Moyu was talking about. He got dressed and looked back at Qu Moyu: \u201c\u2026this morning?\u201d\u201cHmm. He passed away in his sleep. I just found out.\u201d Qu Moyu stood up and straightened his clothes, his face as still as ice, \u201cIt\u2019s been a year after all.\u201dShen Dai thought about it for a long time, and then said, \u201cSorry for your loss.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t go to South Africa then. There will be a lot of things to deal with during this annual leave.\u201d\u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d\u201cCome with me to the living room first.\u201dThe two of them went to the living room. Last night, there was a big family who were beaming. At this time, all the black clothes were worn. The red decorations for Chinese New Year were still hanging all over the house, but the air pressure in the house was extremely low at this time, and no one broke the silence.When the two of them appeared, everyone\u2019s eyes were drawn. Qu Moyu was the future successor of Xingzhou. Only when he was present could they start discussing the funeral matter.Listening to them discussing the details of the funeral, Shen Dai always had a sense of unreality in the clouds and fog. The people he had seen last night were gone when he woke up. He couldn\u2019t help thinking of the scene when his grandfather died, and his heart was full of sorrow. People seem to be like this. If they say they are gone, they will be gone. It is too late to miss and recall them. No one would have expected that sometimes the seemingly ordinary side will be the last side to them.Due to the snowy mountain road, the ambulance arrived in the afternoon. After the body was picked up, all relatives also went down the mountain.When he returned to Qu\u2019s house, it was already dark. Qu Moyu didn\u2019t say a word along the way and Shen Dai also kept silent. He couldn\u2019t feel sadness from Qu Moyu. But he seemed to be engulfed in all kinds of concerns. He couldn\u2019t quite understand it but he is also aware that the death of Grandpa Qu represents the beginning of a bloody battle.Qu Moyu went straight upstairs. Uncle Heng and Aunt Lan looked at his back and sighed, and whispered, \u201cWhy did he pass away on the first day of the new year?\u201dShen Dai also sighed: \u201cLast night, he was okay when we met him. It seems that there are no major problems with eating, talking, and thinking.\u201dUncle Heng shook his head: \u201cThe old man can still hold them down. As soon as the old man leaves, his uncle will definitely move. I\u2019m very worried about the young master.\u201d He turned and walked to the kitchen, \u201cI\u2019ll prepare some supper.\u201dShen Dai is more worried about Qu Chengchen than Qu Chengchen\u2019s father. Thinking of Qu Moyu\u2019s frowning eyebrows, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a little distressed. But unfortunately, he was afraid that he wouldn\u2019t be able to help him.Aunt Lan took Shen Dai\u2019s hand: \u201cAh Dai, be more considerate to the young master. You are the closest person to the young master now. He treats you differently.\u201dShen Dai smiled bitterly and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I can do for him.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what the reason was for you two to get married. Now you two are more and more like a real couple. He has never brought any omega home and he has never cared so much about anyone. He must have you in his heart. When he needs you, stay by his side and do whatever he wants you to do.\u201dAunt Lan\u2019s remarks gave Shen Dai great encouragement. He wished he could listen to it a hundred times more. He also believed that it was not his wishful thinking. He nodded: \u201cAunt Lan, don\u2019t worry. I will do my best.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 38": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the next few days, Qu Moyu went out early and returned late. His whole person was surrounded by low mood, and he became taciturn and preoccupied.In order to see him more, Shen Dai got up early to eat breakfast with him and had to wait until he came back in the evening before he could sleep at ease. But he hardly gave Shen Dai any attention.Shen Dai knew that Qu Moyu must be under a lot of pressure to deal with all kinds of difficult people and work. He was very worried and distressed for Qu Moyu, but he couldn\u2019t help him.The news of the old man passing away was completely blocked. The stock market was closed during the Chinese New Year. These few days are the opportunity for the Qu family to balance various affairs. Due to the poor situation of the entire industry in the past two years, Chuanghai is already half-dead and the stock prices of other companies in the industry are fluctuating and falling. This is due to the tightening of national policies, the continuous ups and downs in mergers and acquisitions with Chuanghai, and also the investment and research projects that have not produced great benefits. These negative news continued to accumulate, and the market gradually lost confidence in Xingzhou. If the founder of Xingzhou is announced dead at this time, his death will definitely have an unpredictable impact on the stock market.However, it is impossible to hide such important news for too long. The only good thing is that the old man died during the Chinese New Year and the market did not open for a day. They still have time to stabilise their shareholders and minimise any negative impact.This is Qu Moyu\u2019s answer in the face of Shen Dai\u2019s concern at breakfast. Shen Dai had some thoughts in his heart. The death of ordinary people involves the feeling of grief, or some property to settle for. But the death of Grandpa Qu has something to do with everything. Property, power struggle, stock price, public opinion but has nothing to do with the feeling of grief alone. He did not see sadness in any of the Qu family members. For them, this is a crisis and also an opportunity. Everyone wants to take advantage of the chaos to grab what they want. A person who has created a mountain of wealth and has a large number of children and grandchildren in truth has no one who really felt sad and cherished him when he died. Is this a success or a failure?The ruthlessness and rationality shown by Qu Moyu made Shen Dai not know how to feel.On the fourth day of the New Year, more than half of the holiday had passed. Shen Dai read a book for the whole day and lay in bed at night. He stared at the calendar on his mobile phone and hesitated whether to go home the next day. After the death of the founder, several senior executives who were inspected by their peers had to return to China in advance and he also should be back.After making up his mind, he decided not to wait for Qu Moyu that night. He went to bed early and bought some New Year\u2019s goods to take back home the next morning.He was about to fall asleep when his cell phone rang suddenly. The ringtone in the dead of night sounded very loud and Shen Dai was awakened abruptly.He took the mobile phone while barely able to open a gap in his sour sleepy eyes. When he saw that the caller ID was from Qu Moyu, he immediately pressed the green button: \u201cHello?\u201dThere was an even breathing sound from the receiver. After being silent for three or five seconds, Qu Moyu said, \u201cSorry, I woke you up.\u201d A single sound of his voice made his heart beat faster.Shen Dai was sober in the shortest time. He glanced at the time. It was four in the morning, he asked worriedly, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d\u201cHeadache. I can\u2019t sleep. Come and accompany me.\u201dThrough this small communication device, Shen Dai felt something he had never felt from Qu Moyu\u2014 his fragility. His heart became sore and unbearable. It was as if it would melt in the next second, he turned over and jumped out of bed: \u201cI\u2019ll be there in a second.\u201dShen Dai went upstairs lightly. When he stood in front of Qu Moyu\u2019s bedroom door, he paused for a moment. He had never entered Qu Moyu\u2019s bedroom. The closest he had ever been to this place was only when he was called to the study by Qu Moyu and he saw the inner door leading to the bedroom.Qu Moyu does not allow outsiders to set foot on his private territory without permission. In the past, he was not allowed to go up to the entire third floor. He even had to stagger his meal times and try to avoid meeting each other under the same roof. But now, they are more and more connected. Bit by bit, he can now even enter Qu Moyu\u2019s most private territory, which means that he is special, right?Shen Dai took a few deep breaths in a row before suppressing his rushing emotions. He raised his hand and gently knocked on the door.\u201cCome in.\u201dShen Dai pushed the door and entered. The dry and cold woody fragrance filled up the room. It was the ebony pheromone belonging to Qu Moyu. This is the place with the highest concentration of Qu Moyu\u2019s pheromone. Entering here is like walking into an S-class alpha hunting ground. Shen Dai is both the guest and the prey. He is no longer in control of his own self and how he should be treated here.The blackout curtains blocked almost all the light and the room was pitch black. Shen Dai could only tap on the screen of his mobile phone and saw the outline of the bed through the meagre light.\u201cMo Yu?\u201d Shen Dai called out tentatively.Qu Moyu gave a low \u201cHmm\u201d.Shen Dai touched the side of the bed. He was still hesitating whether to go onto the bed or not when he was suddenly grabbed by the wrist and the whole person was dragged into a generous, strong, and warm embrace in the darkness.The hot air gushed around his neck. It was accompanied by Qu Moyu\u2019s heavy breathing, and his heavy body pressing on him, making Shen Dai feel Qu Moyu\u2019s depression: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201dQu Moyu hugged him tightly and adjusted his posture so that they could fit together tighter. He said slowly, \u201cIt\u2019s a migraine.\u201d\u201cHave you taken the medicine? Want me to find Uncle Heng?\u201d Shen Dai thought as he spoke.\u201cNo.\u201d Qu Moyu said in a low voice, \u201cIt\u2019s a normal problem. It occasionally happens, so I can only bear through it.\u201d\u201cWhat about painkillers?\u201d\u201cIt does not work.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you too tired and stressed?\u201d Shen Dai felt distressed. He knew that Qu Moyu went out early and returned late every day and worked under high intensity. He knew that Qu Moyu was under unimaginable pressure to deal with data and with endless troubles coming. He knew that apart from having top genes, Qu Moyu\u2019s efforts were unimaginable to ordinary people. This S-class alpha who seems to be omnipotent is a fatal attraction to him with the halo all over his body. However, this man will also be tired, frustrated, and vulnerable. It has inspired a deeper pity for this man that he loves.\u201cProbably.\u201d\u201cAre you thirsty? I\u2019ll pour you a glass of water.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dQu Moyu agreed, but he refused to let Shen Dai get up. Shen Dai struggled several times, not knowing whether to laugh or cry: \u201cI can\u2019t get up. How can I pour water for you?\u201dQu Moyu was silent again, as if hesitating, and then replied, \u201cNo need.\u201dShen Dai softly reassured him: \u201cIf I can get up, I\u2019ll pour you a glass of water. In ten seconds, your throat will be hoarse. Drinking some water will make you feel more comfortable.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026All right.\u201dShen Dai slowly pulled Qu Moyu\u2019s hand away. He could feel the other party\u2019s reluctance. He quickly jumped out of bed, poured a glass of water guided by the light of his mobile phone, then quickly returned and put the glass to Qu Moyu\u2019s lips: \u201cCome and drink some water.\u201dQu Moyu drank a glass of water in only two mouthfuls.\u201cI\u2019ll pour you another glass.\u201dQu Moyu clasped Shen Dai\u2019s wrist and did not speak. In the darkness, only his eyes were shining, like a pair of beast\u2019s eyes, trying to confirm if the prey he got would escape or not.\u201cSoon. Ten seconds.\u201d Shen Dai couldn\u2019t imagine that Qu Moyu would have this side before, he could only coax him, \u201cBe good.\u201dAfter Qu Moyu drank the second glass of water, he put down the glass. It was as if he couldn\u2019t wait to wrap Shen Dai in his arms again. He pressed him with the weight of half his body, then he closed his eyes with peace of mind and asked, \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s four a.m., haven\u2019t you been able to fall asleep?\u201d Shen Dai stroked Qu Moyu\u2019s face in the dark, he couldn\u2019t see anything clearly, but he could imagine the tired face of the person he liked at this time experiencing headache and insomnia. Qu Moyu must be very uncomfortable at this time and he also feels uncomfortable for him.\u201cI want to sleep. But I can\u2019t.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s voice was full of tiredness and helplessness.\u201cYou must be too tired and stressed.\u201d\u201cMaybe.\u201d Qu Moyu whispered, \u201cThe death will be announced tomorrow. And we will do a series of public relations for the negative news during the next three-day holiday to try to stabilise the stock price.\u201d\u201cIs the impact so big?\u201d\u201cThe main reason is that the policy trend this year is still not optimistic, and the environmental protection indicators are getting stricter every year. We have to invest a lot of money to upgrade equipment and optimise processes. In recent years, the mining industry has not been favoured by the market. The company has a series of actions, and now any bad news may leave some bad impact.\u201d\u201cThe market is cyclical. The downturn in the mining industry is linked to the general environment. When the entire industry is not very good, Xingzhou\u2019s performance is still excellent. You don\u2019t have to worry too much. Investors have good judgement.\u201d\u201cI hope so.\u201d Qu Moyu pressed the bone knot of his finger against his temple, trying to replace the pain with another pain.\u201cCan I massage it for you?\u201d Shen Dai held up Qu Moyu\u2019s head and put it on his lap: \u201cMaybe it can be relieved.\u201d\u201cAre you good at it?\u201dShen Dai smiled and said, \u201cYou will know if you try it. I used to give my grandpa a massage.\u201dShen Dai first gently massaged Qu Moyu\u2019s thick black hair with his fingers, and then pressed down horizontally and vertically from the centre of his eyebrows: \u201cAre you satisfied, boss?\u201dQu Moyu smiled lowly: \u201cWell, it\u2019s a bit strong.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a man.\u201d Shen Dai thought this explanation was awkward, but he really wanted to say, \u201cOmega is just my second gender, of course I\u2019m strong.\u201d\u201cOkay, you\u2019re right. I found another advantage of you.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s heart was covered in sweetness: \u201cDo you feel better?\u201d\u201cI feel better.\u201d Qu Moyu let out a sigh, sounding really relieved.\u201cYour body is the most important. Take a day off tomorrow. No, half day, okay?\u201d\u201cNo. Tomorrow will be a stormy day.\u201d Qu Moyu said in a muffled voice, \u201cHave you heard the rumour that my uncle wants to split up the family?\u201d\u201cI heard. Does he really have this plan?\u201d\u201cWell, he wants to strip the chemical sector from Xingzhou.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s voice revealed a hint of gloom, \u201cI will never let him succeed.\u201dShen Dai wanted to remind Qu Moyu to be careful about Qu Chengchen, but it was obviously not the right time to mention the susceptible period. What Qu Moyu needed was to calm down and go to sleep quickly.Shen Dai gently guided him to stop discussing work, but to talk about other topics, until his fingers felt numb and his legs were sore. Hearing Qu Moyu\u2019s breathing gradually eased, he thought he should be asleep soon. With his own sleepiness, he gently moved Qu Moyu\u2019s head to the pillow and whispered, \u201cGo to sleep.\u201dQu Moyu hugged Shen Dai into his arms: \u201cAh Dai.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Qu Moyu felt that for the first time, he experienced the feeling of mutual support between husband and wife. He knew that Shen Dai couldn\u2019t do much. But this night, when he was tossed and turned by exhaustion, anxiety, headache and insomnia, when he was held in his arms like this and heard him say a few words in a warm voice, he felt a lot better.Shen Dai\u2019s response was to drop a gentle kiss on Qu Moyu\u2019s forehead.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He turned off the alarm, turned over and pressed himself on Shen Dai. His brain was not yet awake but his instinct had already driven him to lean towards the back of Shen Dai\u2019s neck and kiss the gland that exuded the fragrant smell of flowers.The weight on his body was too heavy and Shen Dai felt a little breathless. He turned his face and asked, \u201cDo you feel better that you had slept?\u201d\u201cMuch better.\u201d Qu Moyu kissed Shen Dai\u2019s cheek. He used to think that Shen Dai\u2019s pheromone was too weak, but after getting used to it, he found that such a light fragrance made him very comfortable. The smell was rich in flavour. The more he smells it, the more he has the desire to dig deeper. It has become a rare interest.\u201cAre you going to get up now?\u201d Shen Dai wanted to persuade Qu Moyu to rest for a few more hours. If he didn\u2019t get enough sleep, he would be more prone to headaches. But when he felt that the thing on his back was getting harder and harder, he didn\u2019t dare to speak.Qu Moyu easily took off Shen Dai\u2019s pyjama pants: \u201cYou can also be late.\u201dMost men become horny in the morning and Shen Dai is no exception. But he thought that Qu Moyu had only slept for two or three hours and he himself was going home today. This is really not a suitable for sex and he should refuse. But before he had time to say the words, Qu Moyu had already pinched his waist and pushed his dick in him.Shen Dai buried his face in the pillow and his body shook violently with the impact of the thrusts. He couldn\u2019t help groaning in his throat and quickly bit the pillowcase near to his mouth to prevent himself from making too much sound. He doesn\u2019t know why he did that but entering this room gave him the illusion of committing a crime. It was obviously just one floor up, but he did not feel accepted here. Last night, he was only needed here because Qu Moyu lowered his psychological defence line due to his headache. He fell asleep on this bed and is being fucked on this bed, and he still felt that he shouldn\u2019t be here- because this is the master bedroom and the master bedroom belongs only to the master.However, Qu Moyu was dissatisfied that he couldn\u2019t hear Shen Dai\u2019s voice. He pinched Shen Dai\u2019s chin, pulled the fair and handsome face off of the pillow: \u201cScream out.\u201dShen Dai glanced at Qu Moyu with wet eyes. Those eyes that contained a bit of grievance and were desperately forbearing made Qu Moyu feel hot all over. He thrusts in fiercely a couple more times and finally forces out the scream from Shen Dai that he wanted to hear.After the \u2018intense exercise\u2019 in the morning, Qu Moyu swept away the decadence of last night and went to wash up, feeling refreshed. Shen Dai rested on the bed for a while before getting up with his sore waist. The bathroom was separated into a wet and a dry space. Qu Moyu was shaving in the dry space and Shen Dai took a shower in the wet space.When Shen Dai came out of the bathroom, the curtains had been drawn. The large floor-to-ceiling windows let in the dazzling sunlight into the room. He raised his hand to block his eyes and only when his eyes could adapt to the light did he realise that Uncle Heng appeared with breakfast in the room.Shen Dai only had a bath towel around his waist. His hair was only wiped roughly and the water was still dripping. He just rushed into the bathroom to clean up what Qu Moyu had left inside him. When he\u2019s not in heat, his womb doesn\u2019t open on its own. Now that he had finished washing, he planned to take his clothes and go back to his own room as soon as possible. When he saw Uncle Heng, he felt the embarrassment of being caught red-handed in a crime scene.Uncle Heng smiled and greeted, \u201cMr. Shen.\u201d\u201cGood Morning.\u201d Shen Dai greeted him with a smile.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you blow dry your hair?\u201d Qu Moyu was already sitting at the table preparing to eat but when he saw Shen Dai\u2019s wet hair and him coming out with only a bath towel, he put down his coffee cup, \u201cPut on your clothes or you\u2019ll catch a cold.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go back to my room.\u201d\u201cGo and blow dry your hair.\u201dShen Dai had to put on his clothes and go back to the bathroom. His short hair was quickly dried. After he put on his pyjamas and came out, Uncle Heng had already left, and Qu Moyu asked him to have breakfast with him.Qu Moyu ate while looking at his phone: \u201cI\u2019m leaving soon. It\u2019s still early, you can go to sleep for a while after breakfast.\u201d He paused, then added, \u201cYou can sleep here too.\u201dThe joy he felt in his heart turned into a smile that couldn\u2019t be concealed on his lips. Shen Dai gave Qu Moyu a gentle look and said with concern, \u201cCan\u2019t you make up for a few more sleep? You only slept for three hours.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have enough time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to sleep either. I\u2019ll pack up and go home in a while.\u201d\u201cYou want to go home?\u201d Qu Moyu was stunned for a moment, and seemed to remember that Shen Dai still had his own home. He frowned, feeling somewhat unhappy, \u201cDon\u2019t go back. There are only three days left for the holiday.\u201d\u201cYeah, so I have to go back to accompany my-\u2026\u201d\u201c-You\u2019re already married.\u201d Qu Moyu raised his eyebrows at Shen Dai, \u201cYou\u2019re going to spend the New Year at your husband\u2019s house.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Shen Dai couldn\u2019t tell whether Qu Moyu was joking or serious.Qu Moyu picked up the napkin and wiped his mouth gracefully. When he got up, he kissed Shen Dai\u2019s face: \u201cJust kidding. You can go home, but I want to see you at night.\u201dAfter Qu Moyu left, Shen Dai was stunned for a long time by himself. He then quickly finished his breakfast and went back to his room. He changed his clothes, looked at the laptop he usually carried in his backpack, hesitated for a while, but still took it out of the backpack. He will go home to accompany his grandmother today. He didn\u2019t plan to go to work. In the evening\u2026 Qu Moyu asked him to come back in the evening, and he would come back, so there was no need to bring his laptop with him.He also knew that it was never a good thing to listen to Qu Moyu\u2019s instructions. But he also knew that he was so obedient not only because Qu Moyu was an S-class alpha or his employer, but because he couldn\u2019t refuse any request from Qu Moyu.When he got home, the news of the death of the founder of Xingzhou Group was shown on the TV coincidentally.His grandmother pointed to the TV and said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s no wonder that your business trip ended so quickly. Dear, you\u2019re tossing back and forth like this. Is jet lag not messing you up? Are you tired?\u201d\u201cFortunately, I slept on the plane.\u201d Shen Dai helped his grandmother to sit down, \u201cGrandma, do you want to eat an apple? I\u2019ll cut one for you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to eat, don\u2019t want to eat. I ate a lot in the morning and still haven\u2019t digested them.\u201dSeeing that Shen Qin was going to clean up the house, Shen Dai whispered to his grandmother, \u201cHow are you doing these days? Is he taking good care of you?\u201dHis grandmother smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s good, don\u2019t worry.\u201dShen Dai was relieved when he saw that his grandmother had obviously gained more weight. Her face was not place, and she seemed to be well taken care of.The background sound on the TV was still about Xingzhou, but Shen Dai didn\u2019t pay attention. He chatted with his grandmother on the side. After all, he had more information in private than hearing it from the news.After Shen Qin cleaned up the house, he sat on the sofa and watched TV. When he picked up the remote control to change the channel, he was attracted by a picture on the screen, and the expression on his face gradually changed from surprise to thoughtful.Shen Dai didn\u2019t notice all this.After dinner, Shen Dai used business as an excuse to leave. Looking at his grandmother\u2019s disappointed eyes, he felt very guilty. But when he thought that Qu Moyu might need him, his body was still there but his heart had already flown back to Qu Moyu\u2019s side.Back at Qu\u2019s house, Qu Moyu hadn\u2019t come back yet. Although Shen Dai was a little disappointed, he was not surprised. Today must be the day when he was too busy to even hang around.Shen Dai took a shower, turned on the computer, and started writing his thesis. He wanted to wait for Qu Moyu to come back no matter what time it is so that Qu Moyu could see himself as soon as he got home.This wait lasted until two in the morning.Shen Dai didn\u2019t get enough sleep, so he couldn\u2019t bear it anymore. Just when he was yawning, he finally heard the familiar sound of the engine and he hurried downstairs.Qu Moyu was helped in by Lao Wu and Uncle Heng, because he drank too much. He could smell the alcohol from a distance. From his vain steps and his eyes that were hard to focus, it could be seen that he was drunk.The first time Shen Dai saw Qu Moyu getting drunk, he remembered that Aunt Lan casually mentioned that Qu Moyu didn\u2019t drink often, and if he had a good amount of alcohol, he rarely got drunk. Shen Dai didn\u2019t know what he experienced that day. But seeing that he couldn\u2019t hide the tiredness in his eyes, he couldn\u2019t help feeling distressed himself. He walked over and reached out to touch but there was no room for him to intervene.Unexpectedly, Qu Moyu swung Lao Wu and Uncle Heng away and threw himself on Shen Dai. Although Shen Dai was prepared, Qu Moyu couldn\u2019t stand still. He couldn\u2019t help but keep pulling him down because of his weight. Lao Wu and Uncle Heng quickly came to help again, and they were all about to fall to the ground together.\u201cAh Dai.\u201d Qu Moyu murmured, \u201cAh Dai.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d Shen Dai stroked his back over and over, comforting him gently.\u201cAh Dai.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201dQu Moyu called out his name several times in a row. Shen Dai kept responding patiently As if some restless nerves had finally been smoothed out, Qu Moyu was silent.It took a lot of effort to get Qu Moyu onto the bed. Aunt Lan and Shen Dai helped him undress and cleaned him with a towel and he fell asleep just like that.Aunt Lan said, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the young master drunk for a long time. The last time it seemed\u2026 when he was still young. When he was in his teens, he drank a lot with his friends.\u201d\u201cWhat was he like when he was in his teens?\u201d Shen Dai asked curiously.\u201cLike a little adult. The young master was very mature at an early age. The S-class alphas are like this. He had to learn a lot from a very young age.\u201d Aunt Lan said with some emotion, \u201cActually, he was just a child, and most of the time he pretended to be a mature young master. He\u2019s only 25 after the new year, it\u2019s really hard to carry such a heavy burden on the shoulders of such a young man.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cAh Dai, I think the young master is now relying on you. He kept calling you by your name just now.\u201d Aunt Lan said with a smile, \u201cIt would be great if you could help the young master share some of the pressure of life. The young master needs you to be around. A person who knows the cold and the hot sides of him.\u201dShen Dai looked at Qu Moyu\u2019s sleeping face. It was as quiet and beautiful as a painting. Even though he didn\u2019t drink a drop of alcohol, his heart was also drunk. Of course, he wanted to be the one who was relied on by Qu Moyu. He felt that Qu Moyu had placed him closer to his side. But will he allow him to enter his heart?\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.05.11\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: As I said, let\u2019s indulge in the sweetness while it is still sweet, yeah\u2026 This chapter was quite nsfw but not S-class smut yet (similar to chapter 37) but I still classified the chapter as \u2018mature\u2019 (M). -KPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 40": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTitle: \u9876\u7ea7\u63a0\u98df\u8005 (Alpha Predator)Author\uff1a\u6c34\u5343\u4e1e (ShuiQianCheng)Translator: K (@kin0monogatari)Protagonists \uff1a\u6c88\u5cb1 (Shen Dai -MC), \u77bf\u672b\u4e88 (Qu Moyu -ML)\u058d\u058d\u058dQu Moyu slept very deeply and for a long time. He had a dream that he had walked for a long time in a field covered by white ice and snow. There was no direction or guidance there. There\u2019s only nothingness with no end in sight. He didn\u2019t know where he came from or where he was going. He was so cold and frozen. All his sensory nerves lost consciousness. Suddenly, a fire appeared in front of him, glowing and burning hot. He hugged the fire desperately and immediately his whole body wandered in the warmth. Every inch of his frozen limb which was originally heavy, began to recover. His body became incredibly relaxed. It seemed to be the best and safest place in the world for him.Qu Moyu woke up naturally in such comfort, opened his eyes, and saw a head with soft black hair, looking at his phone with his back facing him. He briefly recalled and found that he had been drunk since the second half of the meal. The previous sleep had helped with his sleep deprivation and had made him feel better. He yawned and saw that Shen Dai didn\u2019t respond. He noticed the black Bluetooth headset on his head.He smiled mischievously, hugged Shen Dai, and quickly pulled the person into his arms.Shen Dai was startled and turned back to look immediately. He woke up very early, but he didn\u2019t dare to get up and didn\u2019t dare to make a sound, for fear of waking Qu Moyu up: \u201cYou. You are awake.\u201dQu Moyu bit his headset and threw it aside: \u201cWhy are you so focused?\u201d He glanced lazily at the screen, which was showing a video of panda cubs playing around.Shen Dai was a little embarrassed: \u201cMy grandma likes to watch pandas and I normally save some to send to her.\u201d\u201cIt turns out that Shen Gong likes pandas.\u201d Qu Moyu used his nose to cup Shen Dai\u2019s glands, sniffed carefully, and sighed contentedly.\u201cDon\u2019t everyone like them?\u201d Shen Dai put down the phone, turned around, took a closer look at Qu Moyu\u2019s face, and smiled, \u201cIt looks like you\u2019ve slept enough. Your face looks better.\u201dIt seemed to be a smile that had finally let go of some weight in him, which made Qu Moyu\u2019s heart palpitate slightly. There was a person who even cared about whether he was getting enough sleep. This feeling is really good. He kissed Shen Dai: \u201cI had dinner with a few shareholders last night and I drank too much. It\u2019s been a long time since I stopped drinking that much.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t remember anything that happened last night?\u201d\u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t even remember how I got in the car or how I got home.\u201dShen Dai teased him: \u201cThen you don\u2019t remember singing and dancing in the living room and taking off your clothes?\u201dQu Moyu was stunned for a moment but immediately saw the sly smile in Shen Dai\u2019s eyes, so he rolled over and pressed down on him to scratch his itch: \u201cDare to bluff me? Huh? Your courage is not small.\u201dShen Dai laughed and begged for mercy and the two of them almost rolled off the bed.After enough teasing, Qu Moyu was lying beside Shen Dai with his naked chest muscles rising and falling with his breathing. His messy hair fell on his cheeks, his eyes were lazy and sloppy, and he was such a sexy mess. Shen Dai dodges his eyes and he doesn\u2019t dare to talk to him or look at him. But he couldn\u2019t help putting his hand on his waist, resting his head on his arm, feeling the heat from his skin and the happiness surrounded by the ebony pheromones.This is my alpha, a voice in Shen Dai\u2019s heart spoke.Seeing Shen Dai obediently lying on his arm, his narrow jaw slightly raised, and his clear eyes constantly peeking and blinking, Qu Moyu felt an itch in his heart. He wanted to go down on him, but he is not in a hurry to do anything. He enjoys this quiet and beautiful morning.The two sat next to each other in a tacit understanding and no one spoke for a few minutes. There was no awkwardness at all. It was as if their relationship was so comfortable and natural.After a long time, Qu Moyu said, \u201cI haven\u2019t slept until late for a long time. It\u2019s almost noon.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to look at his phone. Once he knew the time, it seemed that he should get up, but he didn\u2019t want to break the tenderness of the moment.\u201cWell, it was just to make up for yesterday\u2019s lack of sleep.\u201d\u201cDid you go home yesterday?\u201d\u201cI went back, but I came back here right after dinner.\u201dThere was joy in Qu Moyu\u2019s heart: \u201cYou\u2019re so obedient.\u201d He stroked Shen Dai\u2019s cheek \u2013 it was smooth and warm and it felt very good.\u201cDid everything \u2026 go well yesterday?\u201d Although Shen Dai paid attention to the news and some media, he still asked. He could clearly feel that there were long and short positions in the public opinion. He doesn\u2019t know whether Xingzhou\u2019s public relations managed to stabilise the scene?\u201cIt\u2019s almost as I expected. I will try to eliminate negative voices in the past few days. There will be a three-day buffer. It shouldn\u2019t be too ugly on the opening day. A drop of less than 5% is an ideal result.\u201d\u201cThen what is your uncle\u2019s reaction?\u201dQu Moyu sneered: \u201cHe\u2019s still pretending to be a dutiful son.\u201dShen Dai was silent for a moment: \u201cI\u2019m very worried about you, Qu Chengchen\u2026 has always been malicious.\u201d\u201cGrandpa is dead, and our contest has officially started. I have always been careful, and I didn\u2019t let them get any clues. The only mistake was that he took away my\u2026\u201d Qu Moyu suddenly felt a little awkward and didn\u2019t want to say \u2018fiancee\u2019 or \u2018You Baiyue\u2019 in front of Shen Dai.Shen Dai lowered his eyes.\u201cNo matter what he wants to do, I won\u2019t let any of his plots succeed again.\u201dShen Dai whispered, \u201cEveryone has weaknesses.\u201d\u201cOf course, but how could I let my weakness be exposed to the enemy?\u201d\u201cI thought of one thing.\u201d Shen Dai said hesitantly, \u201cSpring is here and the weather is getting warmer.\u201dQu Moyu looked at Shen Dai quizzically, not knowing what he wanted to say.\u201cIs your\u2026 susceptible period in spring?\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s eyes darkened prominently. His eyebrows frowned and he instinctively erected a defensive wall in his heart. After all, the susceptible period is the most fatal weakness of alpha: \u201cWhy are you asking this?\u201d\u201cI mentioned the weakness just now. I thought of it.\u201d Shen Dai also knew that this explanation was a bit lame. He always wanted to find a suitable time, in a suitable context and chat content, without deliberately reminding Qu Moyu to be careful. Unfortunately, the right time has come, but it is not suitable to bring up this sensitive topic.Qu Moyu looked at Shen Dai silently.\u201cI heard that the top alpha will spend it in an absolutely safe place during the susceptible period.\u201d Shen Dai felt a little nervous, but he behaved very frankly, \u201cI can only think of your weakness is this. Your enemy can also think of it, I just want to remind you.\u201d\u201cI have my own safe house.\u201d Qu Moyu didn\u2019t want to continue this topic at all, he got up and sat, \u201cLet\u2019s get up.\u201dShen Dai sighed in his heart.In the last two days of the annual leave, although Qu Moyu was busy outside during the day, Shen Dai would wait for him to come home every night, and naturally stayed in Qu Moyu\u2019s bedroom. The two of them now look like a real couple. They eat, sleep, and work together. After a busy day, they lie in bed or have sex, or hug and chat, and sleep peacefully after saying good night to each other. Humans are gregarious animals. No one can resist the temptation of intimacy. The sense of security and satisfaction of being cared for, warmed, accepted, and seen is really great.Shen Dai did his best to give Qu Mo his attentiveness, tenderness, understanding, and tolerance. As a mature adult with the ability to love, he used the way he imagined he wanted to be loved, without reservation. He loves Qu Moyu. He believes that all people have feelings and he believes that Qu Moyu at this time must already have his own place in his heart.But this annual vacation, which was as happy as a dream for Shen Dai, was already over.On the first day of working again, Shen Dai was sitting in the laboratory preparing to start the day\u2019s work. But he, who didn\u2019t even open a stock account, opened the stock market at 9:30 in the morning on time to see the market of Xingzhou.The green line is going the way down. Shen Dai stared at it for a few minutes and found that it was useless to look at it like this since it would affect his motivation at work.\u201cWhat are you looking at? You looked so focused.\u201d Cheng Zimei asked curiously.\u201cLooking at our company\u2019s stock.\u201d\u201cIf it goes well, we can get stock rewards this year or next year. It\u2019s been five years since we had one.\u201d\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s still falling down now.\u201d Shen Dai couldn\u2019t help but glance at it again. It seems that not much has changed.\u201cNo way, the whole industry is in a downturn right now. The founder passed away a few days ago and many financial bloggers are talking bad about our company.\u201d Cheng Zimei whispered, \u201cYou really should pay attention to the stock price, maybe you will have a big share in the future. Since you\u2019re the crown princess.\u201d\u201cYou call me that again, I will\u2026\u201d Shen Dai couldn\u2019t think of anything to threaten Cheng Zimei with for a while.At this time, Zhou Lan came over with a box of samples: \u201cSenior brother, sister. This was just sent from Gansu. Where do I put it?\u201dAlthough Zhou Lan was talking to them, he always avoided contact with Shen Dai in his eyes. Since the incident in the office last time, Zhou Lan has avoided him whenever he can. Young boys are not very good at hiding their emotions. The consensus in the laboratory was that \u2018Zhou Lan had no choice but to give up chasing after Shen Dai\u2019. It made Shen Dai feel very embarrassed.\u201cLet\u2019s put it here.\u201d Fortunately, Cheng Zimei came out of the siege. She also joked, \u201cWow Xiao Zhou. You dyed your hair. You look very handsome.\u201d\u201cThank you, Senior Sister Cheng.\u201d Zhou Lan glanced at Shen Dai hurriedly, touched his own hair, and left with a dry smile.\u201cWhat a handsome little guy.\u201d Cheng Zimei said with emotion, \u201cHowever, if you have slept with the crown prince, how could you possibly see ordinary people and feel for them?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. He just wasn\u2019t my type.\u201d\u201cWhat type do you like\u2026? Oh, you like Senior Brother Bai\u2019s type, it looks more\u2026\u201d Cheng Zimei laughed wickedly, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit pretentious, which is really similar to the crown prince.\u201dThe name Senior Brother Bai is both familiar and distant to Shen Dai. He was an alpha senior he liked very much in college, a student of the teacher, and a top talent of Xingzhou. Now, he is leading a team to do a project in the Gansu mining area all by himself. He is the teacher\u2019s most successful student.Shen Dai remembered some things from his student days, and he had some nostalgic feelings for youth in his heart. He said helplessly: \u201cThat is a self-discipline attitude. How can it be pretentious from your mouth?\u201d After he finished speaking, he also endured it. Unable to slander, Qu Moyu is indeed a bit\u2026 pretentious. At least, the Qu Moyu seen by outsiders is completely different from the real Qu Moyu he has come into contact with.\u201cYeah, the crown prince must be perfect in your eyes.\u201d Cheng Zimei teased, \u201cHey, the two of you have warmed up so much in the past year. You have to strike while the iron is still hot.\u201dA smile appeared on Shen Dai\u2019s face: \u201cI think it\u2019s good now. We are getting to know each other and enhancing our feelings for each other.\u201d\u201cSo let you strike while the iron is hot. You must know that you only have the right time and place, but your trump card is not enough. The crown prince must have feelings for you now, but it\u2019s hard to say how much this relationship has to further develop. To consolidate this relationship, you have to have more advantages.\u201dShen Dai felt a little confused.Cheng Zimei winked at Shen Dai: \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know how to deal with a creature like an S-class alpha, human nature is common. You\u2019d better get pregnant with his child while you are in heat and have this lifelong bond-\u2026 \u201c\u201c-Impossible.\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s face changed. It could be said that he looked fierce. The most taboo thing in his life is to do something as greedy, selfish and stupid as what Shen Qin had done. And then let an innocent child bear the consequences. His future child must have a complete family and a generous love from the parents.Cheng Zimei was stunned for a moment. She quickly realised why Shen Dai was angry, and hurriedly pulled Shen Dai\u2019s arm to act like a coquettish: \u201cI\u2019m sorry Dai Dai. I\u2019m talking nonsense. I was just joking. It was not on purpose.\u201dShen Dai took a deep breath: \u201cIt\u2019s alright. But don\u2019t say such things again in the future.\u201d\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.05.12\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: Hey, 2nd Male lead was finally mentioned. It\u2019s Senior Brother Bai (Bai Xiangwan). He will appear in later chapters. My heart is already starting to break. The current raw chapters, however, it\u2019s getting exciting for me. I have read until Chapter 89. There have been mixed opinions about this chapter but I personally think it\u2019s exciting and have been waiting for that moment where I know our cuttlefish will hurt a lot hahahahaha! But no spoiler here and I hope no spoiler in the comment section as well ya\u2026Thanks! Lol! It\u2019s very contradicting for me because the part where I\u2019m translating, QMY was still the big ego asshole whereby in the part of the ongoing raw chapters, QMY is still an asshole but with not that big of an ego anymore and he is making an effort to win SD over (kinda miserable in the effort as well because he is not experienced in love I think?). But Shao Qun is still my most hated ML so nevermind\u2026 Let\u2019s see where this is going. -KPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 41": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTitle: \u9876\u7ea7\u63a0\u98df\u8005 (Alpha Predator)Author\uff1a\u6c34\u5343\u4e1e (ShuiQianCheng)Translator: K (@kin0monogatari)Protagonists \uff1a\u6c88\u5cb1 (Shen Dai -MC), \u77bf\u672b\u4e88 (Qu Moyu -ML)\u058d\u058d\u058dAlthough Xingzhou\u2019s stock price fell on the opening day, it rose a bit at the closing. The overall decline did not exceed 3%, which was completely within Qu Moyu\u2019s expectations.But the real crisis is just beginning.Within a few days, someone anonymously broke the news in the largest financial forum in China. Chuanghai put the most valuable prospecting and mining qualifications in the group into a wholly-owned subsidiary and announced to shareholders that it would take one of the mines. Going out to operate independently is actually to separate debts and facilitate the merger with Xingzhou as soon as possible. This may cause a huge risk, that is, through a series of legal and financial means, Xingzhou will hollow out the high-quality assets of Chuanghai, leaving behind a mess of liabilities. All shareholders will bear the consequences.The analysis of this post is very detailed. At first glance, it was written by someone who knew the inside story and there should be someone important behind it. It spread all over the Internet in a very short time and the stock price of Xingzhou plummeted by 7% the next day.Qu Moyu\u2019s lawyer had contacted Shen Dai the day before, and made an appointment to go to the notary office and the tax department on Friday to go through some procedures. After this happened, he contacted him for another day. Shen Dai realised that this matter should be serious. He sent a message to Qu Moyu to ask but Qu Moyu did not reply.That night, Qu Moyu returned home reek of alcohol. Although he was not drunk, he did not drink less depending on his state.Shen Dai helped him take off his clothes and prepared the hangover medicine while he was taking a bath.Qu Moyu came out wrapped in a bath towel in a daze. He wiped it sloppily, his strong chest was covered with water stains and his hair was dripping wet.Shen Dai knew he was tired.Shen Dai walked over with a towel and gently wiped the water on his body: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wipe yourself dry? The weather\u2019s not so warm anymore.\u201dQu Moyu stretched his arms and hugged Shen Dai\u2019s thin waist. He put his face on his chest, closed his eyes and listened to his steady and powerful heartbeat.\u201cYou must be tired.\u201d Shen Dai wiped his wet hair again and said softly, \u201cToday seems to be a very bad day. Fortunately, it will be over soon.\u201dQu Moyu muttered: \u201cTomorrow may be worse.\u201d\u201cWhat happened today is out of your expectation and you are caught off guard. But if you handle it well, tomorrow will be better than today.\u201dQu Moyu raised his head and looked at Shen Dai without blinking. His hard chin was against his ribs. It actually hurt a little, but that pain couldn\u2019t take Shen Dai\u2019s attention away. The blank eyes attracted him. Alcohol made this usually firm and stern man become a little dull. His dilated pupils were like a vast galaxy, losing focus but showing a broken beauty. Most importantly, he was looking up. Qu Moyu, an S-class alpha who is always looking down on others, is showing some kind of a special trust and dependence on himself at this moment. It is almost like\u2026 like a child.Shen Dai\u2019s heart was surging, but he maintained absolute composure. This is because he knew that people who are in chaos and confusion needed a firm consolation from those close to them.Qu Moyu said slowly, \u201cIt turns out that you are quite good at comforting people.\u201dShen Dai smiled: \u201cWhat I said is true. I believe in you.\u201dQu Moyu also smiled: \u201cThe longer I stay with you, the more I think you have surprises worth exploring.\u201d\u201cThen do you want to know more about me?\u201d Shen Dai bent down, held Qu Moyu\u2019s face and kissed his forehead.\u201cI want to.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s hand went around the back of Qu Moyu\u2019s neck, tentatively using his index and middle fingers to gently and inadvertently stick to his glands, and at the same time his heart beats like a drum. The gland is an extremely important and sensitive part for alphas and omegas. Although it is not as private as the sex organs, only close family members, lovers and friends can touch it. The difference is that omega\u2019s exposed glands represent trust and obedience, while for S-class alphas, glands symbolise power and strength, and they cannot be molested. If Qu Moyu can accept that he touches his glands, that would already mean a lot.Sure enough, Qu Moyu\u2019s body froze. Even though his brain was paralyzed by alcohol, he still instinctively sensed the strange touch from the back of his neck, which was different from a hug around his neck. Below the hairline, in between the skull and the torso, under that flat skin hides one of his most vital parts.After getting feedback from Qu Moyu\u2019s body, Shen Dai also raised his hand as if he was burned, pretending to be unintentional, and he said, \u201cHave you taken the hangover medicine? I\u2019ll go get a hair dryer and blow your hair.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dShen Dai took the hair dryer and stood in front of Qu Moyu to blow his hair. Qu Moyu was mischievous when he received the service. He used two strong thighs to clamp Shen Dai\u2019s legs, and then he got his hands into Shen Dai\u2019s clothes. He groped around in his clothes and deliberately threw the water from his hair onto Shen Dai\u2019s face.Shen Dai finally finished blowing, and as soon as he put down the hairdryer, he was picked up by Qu Moyu and thrown onto the bed.The energy of an S-class alpha is really too high. It seems that sex is not a matter of physical strength, but a relaxing entertainment. At least in the daily sex when the omega is not in heat, Shen Dai didn\u2019t have the say in how many times to do it, how long to do it, and how to deal with Qu Mo Yu\u2019s physical strength. Shen Dai\u2019s physical strength always couldn\u2019t match his.This time, however, it was restrained. Qu Moyu hugged Shen Dai, who was breathing lightly, and enjoyed the peace and tenderness after sex. The two chatted about what happened today.The revelation this time is really the person behind the incident was Qu Chengchen. It was done in order to achieve two purposes. One is to hinder the progress of the merger, and the other is to pull down the stock price.Shen Dai doesn\u2019t understand finance: \u201cHe also owns a lot of Xingzhou stocks. Isn\u2019t this harming others and not benefiting himself?\u201d\u201cHe wants to disrupt the merger and push the group\u2019s strategic direction to the chemical industry. Once successful, he will have more right to speak. The mining industry has been in a downturn in the past two years, and it may be difficult to improve in the next few years. Fortunately, we chose rare earth. This track can go to overseas markets, at least it is still profitable now, and it will not be half-dead like Chuanghai.\u201d\u201cOther minerals are really not easy to deal with, but the demand for rare earths has never stopped. What we need most now is time.\u201d Shen Dai talked about his work, and he was full of spirit, \u201cOnce the research and development is successful, it will get better. The cost advantage of Xingzhou will usher in a huge income.\u201dQu Moyu stared at the ceiling in the dark night, and said solemnly, \u201cYes. My father and I both firmly believe in this. But in the past few years, the investment in research and development has been huge, coupled with the downturn in the industry, some shareholders have been shaken, and today\u2019s stock price has plummeted. It proves that investors are also losing confidence.\u201d\u201cThen what are you going to do?\u201d Although Qu Moyu\u2019s tone sounded calm, Shen Dai could fully imagine how much pressure he was under.\u201cThe public opinion is handed over to the public relations. Although the impact cannot be completely eliminated, this kind of industry insider that most people can\u2019t understand will not have any lasting popularity. And it is not as much discussion as arranging the posting of my gossip online. The person who was involved has also been found out, and the next step will be to sue him for spreading rumours.\u201d\u201cSo you know that someone is gossiping about you online?\u201d Shen Dai wanted to laugh.\u201cThose people are really boring.\u201d Qu Moyu frowned, \u201cThe most important thing now is to push the merger case to be completed as soon as possible. Has lawyer Chen contacted you?\u201d\u201cI had an appointment with him, but today I was told it was delayed.\u201d\u201cWell, I will communicate with him tomorrow. The more if this is the case, the more decisive we must be. This is to avoid any relapse over You Xinghai. It is impossible for Qu Chengchen not to be involved in You Xinghai\u2019s business. Maybe soon he will meet Xiao Yue and they will really get married.\u201dListening to these people taking marriage as a bargaining chip so easily, Shen Dai felt uncomfortable, he said, \u201cI will cooperate fully.\u201d\u201cWhy am I hungry again\u2026?\u201d Qu Moyu muttered, \u201cAh Dai, go get me something to eat. I\u2019m so hungry that I can\u2019t sleep.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll cook a bowl of noodles for you.\u201dShen Dai went downstairs, preparing to cook a simple noodle soup for Qu Moyu for one night. While he was busy, Aunt Lan came to the kitchen wrapped in a nightgown.Shen Dai said apologetically, \u201cAunt Lan, I\u2019m sorry. Did I wake you?\u201d Aunt Lan\u2019s room was the closest to the kitchen. Perhaps the sound was loud when he closed the freezer\u2019s door just now.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019m a light sleeper. Why are you\u2026- is the young master hungry?\u201d\u201cYeah, he said he was too hungry to fall asleep.\u201d\u201cLet me help you.\u201d\u201cNo, you can go to sleep. I\u2019m just cooking noodles. It\u2019ll be fast.\u201dAunt Lan leaned against the counter and looked at Shen Dai with a smile: \u201cLook at the two of you. Now you look more like a young couple.\u201dShen Dai couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u201cHey, the young master is lying down and complaining he is hungry.\u201d Aunt Lan suddenly became puzzled, \u201cThe young master usually seldom eats late-night snacks, and he won\u2019t get up to eat after falling asleep, unless he is very hungry.\u201d\u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t eat much at the meeting at night.\u201dAunt Lan thought for a moment: \u201cEither he didn\u2019t eat a few bites at there, or I\u2019m afraid his susceptible period is coming soon.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s hand stirring the noodles paused. He didn\u2019t think in this direction at all, but what Aunt Lan said really surprised him.Although the susceptible period of alpha normally occurs in spring and summer, the brain is also dominated by the instinct of copulation and reproduction. It is very different from the omega\u2019s estrus period. For example, on the eve of the susceptible period, alpha\u2019s food intake will increase. The more food they eat, the more they need to reserve a lot of physical energy and calories to cope with the predicament that they may not be able to go out to hunt during the susceptible period. Of course, in modern society, there is no risk of starvation if you don\u2019t go out to hunt. But this instinct is engraved in the genes and passed down from generation to generation.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.05.13\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: Ayy\u2026 I\u2019m so not good at business talk.

Those with chips in their hands felt the thrill of riding a roller coaster.Shen Dai originally wanted to pay attention, but because the professional knowledge involved was too much and too complicated, he didn\u2019t really look into it. In addition, he was very busy with work these days, so he didn\u2019t even have time to pay attention.A few days later, lawyer Chen took him to complete all the formalities and procedures that he should go through. He had to work overtime to make up for the time lost during the day. After all these trivial and complicated things were done, he felt a lot lighter. At the same time, the process of Xingzhou\u2019s acquisition of Chuanghai was repeated and bumpy. From external public opinion and internal dynamics, as well as the occasional information from Qu Moyu\u2019s mouth, Shen Dai felt that this matter could not be facilitated in the short term. His mood is very contradictory. On the one hand, he certainly hopes that Qu Moyu can get what he wants. On the other hand, the success of the merger means that their marriage relationship will end.He has both short-term and long-term worries, but fortunately, since he was young when he was burdened with huge debts and the heavy responsibility of supporting his family, he was used to living under stress. So he will take it step by step.That day, he was working in the research institute and suddenly received a call from someone that he was very reluctant to answer.There\u2019s no caller ID, only a string of numbers. He didn\u2019t want to add this number to his address book, but he remembered that it was from You Xinghai from the first time he saw it because he had a good memory.Shen Dai returned to his office and slid the green button.You Xinghai, who was on the phone, sounded obviously furious. He said straight to the point, \u201cCome to my company and take your dad away.\u201dShen Dai was stunned for two seconds, and then his scalp exploded: \u201cHe went to your company?\u201d\u201cYes, come quickly! I\u2019m talking to someone. What\u2019s he doing here?!\u201d You Xinghai took a deep breath and said through gritted teeth, \u201cIs the money I gave you not enough for you to give him away?\u201dAlthough these words were unpleasant, Shen Dai was fortunate to be talking across the phone at this time instead of standing in front of You Xinghai. Otherwise, the person he hated the most would be caught by his fist: \u201cI\u2019ll be there soon.\u201dShen Dai hurried to the headquarters of Chuanghai Group and was led directly to the office by You Xinghai\u2019s secretary. In the elevator, Shen Dai could feel that the secretary looked at him differently.As soon as he entered the office, he saw Shen Qin sitting on the sofa with eyes looking around, while You Xinghai was standing by the floor-to-ceiling window. In terms of distance, it was the farthest place from the entire office to Shen Qin. Shen Dai stood at the door, and the three of them formed an equilateral triangle. It was funny and ironic.The secretary quietly closed the door.Shen Dai has only been in the same space with his two fathers twice in his life. The first time was when Shen Qin asked You Xinghai for money, and the second time was also when Shen Qin asked You Xinghai for money.The first time he was just a seven-year-old at the mercy of others but now he\u2019s grown up.Shen Dai stared at Shen Qin and said solemnly, \u201cGo home. You won\u2019t get what you want here.\u201dShen Qin\u2019s tears fell as soon as he said it: \u201cIs that home? I ave grown old, I can only sleep on the sofa in the living room and I don\u2019t even have a room of my own.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t solve the problem by running here.\u201dShen Qin turned to You Xinghai: \u201cYou Xinghai, I gave you such an excellent son, who has education and looks, and is in love with the Xingzhou\u2019s heir, you shouldn\u2019t thank me\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough!\u201d Shen Dai said sharply, \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed? Do you have to make yourself and me so embarrassed?\u201d\u201cDo you feel ashamed?\u201d Shen Qin pointed at You Xinghai, \u201cIt\u2019s him who did the wrong thing, why doesn\u2019t he feel ashamed? Also, he said just now that he gave you money, and he gave you the money to buy the house. You can ask him for money, why can\u2019t I? Am I not trying to ease your burden or to let our family live a better life!\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Shen Dai wanted to refute, but it was a fact that You Xinghai gave him money, and although he didn\u2019t ask for it, he couldn\u2019t tell the truth, \u201cI\u2019ve tried my best to support you, you have no worries about food and clothing, and you still have money. What do you want? You will stay in my room in the future, okay?\u201d\u201c\u2018Worry about food and clothing\u2019?\u201d Shen Qin cried and said, \u201cI, Shen Qin, have never enjoyed anything in my life, and now I have to live on the little money to spend every few minutes. If I buy a bottle of aromatherapy, you will give me a face. You never consider my feelings, why can\u2019t you stand by me!\u201dShen Dai was trembling with anger, and You Xinghai\u2019s face was ashen, and the office was filled with violent alpha pheromones, indicating that his endurance was disintegrating.\u201cGo. You go home.\u201d Shen Dai clenched his fists, his eyes stern, \u201cOr never come back.\u201dShen Qin\u2019s shoulders shrank and his aura was greatly weakened as his eyes wandered. He knew his son. He seemed calm and peaceful, but he was actually very stubborn and tenacious.After hesitating, Shen Qin stood up, sobbing, wiping his tears, and giving You Xinghai a vicious look: \u201cOne day Ah Dai and Xingzhou\u2019s heir got married, you will be begging me\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not your place to talk about it.\u201d Shen Dai and You Xinghai looked at each other, his eyes were cold and disgusting, and he didn\u2019t give in, which made You Xinghai also startled.On the way back, Shen Qin tried to talk to Shen Dai several times, but Shen Dai was silent.When they got home and the two got out of the car, Shen Qin was still wiping away tears, as if he was deeply wronged: \u201cDon\u2019t look at Dad like this. You Xinghai owes me. He ruined my life.\u201dShen Dai was silent for a moment and said, \u201cThere was news some time ago that a person was in a relationship with a celebrity. After breaking up, he asked for a breakup fee and was sent to prison in the name of extortion.\u201dShen Qin looked at Shen Dai in amazement.\u201cYou Xinghai said that if there is another time, he will not consider the old feelings again.\u201dAlthough this sentence was made up, it successfully acted as a deterrent. Shen Qin\u2019s complexion completely changed. Anger, unwillingness, and fear appeared on his face at once in a short period of time.\u201cDon\u2019t go home yet. Find a place to sit for a while. Don\u2019t let grandma see your emotions, and don\u2019t tell her anything.\u201d Shen Dai had countless accusations in his heart that he wanted to vent, but in the end he held back. He is result-oriented and is used to doing things objectively. The most important thing now is to stop Shen Qin from doing anymore stupid things.Shen Qin nodded.\u201cDon\u2019t go to You Xinghai again, no matter if it\u2019s a phone call or a meeting. In the future, you will stay in my room. I will go home less and I will sleep on the sofa. If you think this kind of life is not good enough and not enjoyable enough, then think about prison life.\u201dShen Qin shrank his shoulders and was really scared: \u201cI, I know.\u201dShen Dai didn\u2019t want to look at him again, so he went straight upstairs and went to cook dinner for his grandmother.When he returned to Qu\u2019s house, it was very late. And it was rare for Qu Moyu to go home earlier than him. But after this exhausting day, he had no energy to ask Qu Moyu how his day was.At this time, Qu Moyu was having a late night snack. On weekdays, he has a fixed standard for the daily calorie intake. Even if he needs to eat something to cushion his stomach at night, he will only eat a small amount of food, but the meal on the table now is a complete meal.Shen Dai thought to himself, this is indeed a sign of the eve of the susceptible period.\u201cWorking overtime again?\u201d Qu Moyu said, \u201cAre you hungry? Come and eat something.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d Shen Dai sat next to him, \u201cWhy are you eating so much so late?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d Qu Moyu put down his chopsticks, looked at Shen Dai carefully, and frowned slightly, \u201cYou look tired.\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s tired and depressed look made him feel uncomfortable.Shen Dai smiled wryly and nodded: \u201cI\u2019ll go to take a bath first.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dShen Dai lay on the bed after taking a bath, feeling that his whole body was stretched a little. He rolled in a circle, rolled up the quilt to wrap himself, buried his face in it, smelled the cold fragrance of ebony and his heart gradually calmed down.After the anger subsided, a message that he temporarily ignored came to mind.How did Shen Qin find out that he was with Qu Moyu? Mostly through the car, maybe the licence plate number is recorded, or there may be other means. In short, it has been found out.For Shen Qin, the current life is too ordinary and poor. And it is too far from the luxury he has enjoyed. His desire for money is unprecedentedly high. Knowing that he now has a \u2018rich boyfriend\u2019, will he do something more irrational?Shen Dai didn\u2019t know how to deal with Shen Qin. He is a ticking time bomb that could harm his life again at any time. After all, he was his biological father. People can\u2019t choose their origin. How can he get rid of a bad close relative?Not long after, Qu Moyu entered the room, lifted the quilt covering Shen Dai\u2019s face, looked at his worried appearance and lightly stroked his face. He said softly, \u201cwhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I\u2019m just tired.\u201d Shen Dai smiled at Qu Moyu, \u201cCan I apply for more overtime pay?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t I give you a lab? You can lead.\u201dShen Dai was still laughing, thinking that Qu Moyu was joking. But seeing Qu Moyu\u2019s serious expression, he was at a loss.\u201cDon\u2019t you want to do your own project?\u201dShen Dai sat up, he pondered for a moment, and replied seriously: \u201cYes, but my current strength is not enough. I have not been able to stand alone.\u201d He paused, his eyes were firm, \u201cI will, but I need more time.\u201dQu Moyu smiled with satisfaction: \u201cWhen you have such strength, I will support you.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Shen Dai breathed a sigh of relief. He knew that Qu Moyu was testing himself. According to what he knew about Qu Moyu, he was a clear-headed and even callous decision-maker who would always think of the company\u2019s importance. The interests are exchanged for a less important favour. He knows that Qu Moyu has some feelings for himself, at least he has needs, but if he shows \u2018pride and arrogance\u2019 and exposes excessive demands, Qu Moyu will definitely be on guard against him.He really doesn\u2019t know how to pursue an S-class alpha, but he understands human nature. He hopes that what Qu Moyu has always received from him is comfort and peace of mind. This is the way he loves and the way he thinks he can get love.Qu Moyu took Shen Dai into his arms and gently stroked his back: \u201cGo to bed early if you are tired.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dAfter the two were silent for several minutes, when Shen Dai was about to go to sleep, Qu Moyu suddenly said, \u201cI am indeed approaching the susceptible period.\u201dShen Dai opened his eyes.\u201cIf you are in estrus during the susceptible period, I can\u2019t help you. I have arranged a doctor for you, and he will use drugs with lower side effects to help you get through the estrus period. Those previous inhibitors, don\u2019t take them anymore.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201d\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.05.16\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: I\u2019ll spoil you guys right ahead.

When they were about to go out, Qu Moyu asked, \u201cIs your grandma going to an appointment today?\u201d\u201cYeah, what did Assistant Cheng tell you?\u201d Shen Dai was very happy. Every time Qu Moyu showed his concern for his affairs, it proved that they have a close relationship.\u201cThat the indicators are normal now.\u201dShen Dai said with a smile: \u201cYes. Grandma is recovering well and has a good appetite. She has gained almost ten pounds during this period of time.\u201d\u201cVery good.\u201d Qu Moyu nodded with satisfaction, \u201cLet\u2019s go to work.\u201dShen Dai took two steps forward and suddenly came to Qu Moyu\u2019s side. While no one was around, he tiptoed and kissed him. He then whispered, \u201cThank you. Thanks to you, my grandma wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy such a good medical care.\u201dQu Moyu glanced at Shen Dai with a smile. His eyes were slightly curved. The curvature was charming and good-looking, and his eyes showed a meaningful look. He touched Shen Dai\u2019s hair: \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201dAt noon, Shen Dai invited Cheng Ruoze to have dinner at a high-end Cantonese restaurant near the company. After lunch, the two of them would take the business car seconded by Cheng Ruoze to pick up Shen Dai\u2019s grandmother. Then, they went to the hospital together.During these several appointments, Cheng Ruoze had arranged for a car to pick up and deliver them. Although this was a task that Qu Moyu had entrusted to him, Shen Dai still thanked him very much.Cheng Ruoze was very busy with his work. He picked up two phone calls during dinner and when he came back, the dishes were a little cold.\u201cSorry, Shen Gong.\u201d Cheng Ruoze said with a wry smile, \u201cThere have been a lot of things happening recently. You know, there is some turmoil inside and outside of the company right now.\u201dShen Dai was also very embarrassed: \u201cAllow me to go by myself next time. It\u2019s also very convenient for me to take a taxi. It takes a whole afternoon of your time. It\u2019s too much time for you.\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t work, this matter is more important than other matters.\u201d Cheng Ruoze looked at his watch: \u201cLet\u2019s hurry up and eat first.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThe two chatted while eating, and Shen Dai learned that Cheng Ruoze\u2019s father was an old subordinate of Qu Shen.Cheng Ruoze\u2019s personality is different from that of many well-born A-level alphas. He has no obvious superiority, and is funny and easy-going. They talked about the company\u2019s big and small trends, and also about Qu Moyu himself. It was obvious that he admired Qu Moyu very much. He was also very smart. Not only regarding workplace wisdom, but also regarding life wisdom.Shen Dai is also very happy to listen to him and learn more stuff about Qu Moyu that he does not know, such as the difference between Qu Moyu when he was in school and after he went to work. And also how he became a qualified figure in front of employees, executives, elders and other people. He is the decision maker. He has to know how to deal with pressure and setbacks. Shen Dai also listened to the stories behind some of his most talked-about achievements.After talking, Cheng Ruoze became worried again: \u201cNow there are a lot of happenings in the company, but Mr. Qu is about to enter the susceptible period. Even if he takes medicine, it can only be shortened by two or three days.\u201dShen Dai frowned and said, \u201cSuppressive drugs during the susceptible period are very harmful to the body.\u201dAlthough the susceptibility period of alpha is only once a year, it is ferocious and the degree of hormone imbalance is much higher than that of omega. In the past, if the susceptibility period was delayed or suppressed with hormonal drugs, it was not necessarily successful, and the damage to the body was greater, so now it was the best choice.However, the current situation of the company is indeed not optimistic, and Qu Moyu may not be able to allow himself to disappear for a week.\u201cYeah, we will decide after seeing the situation. We are all trying to persuade President Qu.\u201d Cheng Ruoze sighed, \u201cYou can also persuade him when you have time. Compared with us, President Qu will definitely listen to you more.\u201dShen Dai knew that Qu Moyu would probably not listen to him, but he still had to try. He asked again: \u201cHe said he would go to his safe house during the susceptible period.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Cheng Ruoze said while eating, \u201cThe susceptible period of the S-class alpha is not a joke, and it even requires air defense-level isolation measures.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 it should be secured?\u201d Shen Dai knew that many places had special isolation houses rented to alphas to spend the susceptible period, especially for single alphas who had no one to take care of them.Alphas are dangerous and vulnerable during the susceptible period. The danger is that they will be more aggressive than usual. Their brains were dominated by hormones and desire to reproduce, making them like prehistoric animals. Their rational thinking ability is greatly blunted, and primitive instinct drives their language and behavior. At this time, if there are strangers approaching, they are likely to be violently expelled, and their vulnerability is that their minds will also degenerate. All wisdom will fail, and those who are allowed to enter their territory can easily deceive, exploit and hurt them.Alphas with family members usually choose to spend the susceptible period at home. As long as they are not stimulated by the outside world, they are locked in the room, combined with calming drugs and moderate comfort, and generally there will be no problems.But the susceptibility period of the S-class alpha will make everyone, including themselves, facing the enemy. They degenerate into an uncontrolled bioweapon for up to seven days, with lethal attacks on strangers who dare to step into their territory, and those close to them must be guarded. Therefore, many powerful S-class alphas have exclusive and secret safe houses.Cheng Ruoze doesn\u2019t seem to be worried at all: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. There has never been a problem.\u201dShen Dai thought of Qu Chengchen\u2019s winning face and his heart was always uneasy. Qu Chengchen himself was an S-class alpha. Could it be that he didn\u2019t know how safe the safe house was? Why was he so determined then?Does Qu Chengchen know where Qu Moyu\u2019s safe house is? Not necessarily. If that\u2019s the case, he doesn\u2019t need to ask\u00a0 himself to cooperate with him. When Qu Moyu is in the susceptible period, he has more means to snatch things away. He was mostly bluffing or using marker as bait. He might want him to be too greedy and agreed to cooperate with him so that he would betray Qu Moyu step by step.Thinking of this, Shen Dai broke out in a cold sweat. He should have more confidence in Qu Moyu and be cautious about what despicable purpose Qu Chengchen has to use him for.After dinner, they took the car together to pick up grandma and Shen Qin.This business car was also used during the first few appointments. At that time, Shen Qin wondered why Shen Dai\u2019s friend was so enthusiastic and thought that Cheng Ruoze was Shen Dai\u2019s suitor. Now, after contacting him, he understood that it was Qu Moyu who arranged everything. He was very enthusiastic about Cheng Ruoze. He kept chatting with Cheng Ruoze on the road, trying to make conversation.Cheng Ruoze was very smart and smiled perfunctorily.After the appointment, they sent Shen Dai\u2019s grandmother and Shen Qin home.Cheng Ruoze smiled and said to Shen Dai, \u201cActually, today Mr. Qu also asked me to do another job.\u201d\u201cWhat job?\u201d Shen Dai asked curiously.Cheng Ruoze raised his finger and pointed to Shen Dai\u2019s house on the third floor: \u201cThe loan for this house, Mr. Qu has paid off all of it for you.\u201dShen Dai stared blankly at Cheng Ruoze.\u201cLine X is our cooperative bank. All the procedures have been prepared there. Do you bring your ID card with you? I\u2019ll take you over just to sign to complete it.\u201dShen Dai came back to his senses, but he didn\u2019t know how to react. He held the phone and wanted to call Qu Moyu immediately. Qu Moyu\u2019s kindness to him has piled up higher and higher. From the moment he saved him four years ago, this man is like a light in his life, constantly shining for him. He was very moved. But can he accept this with peace of mind? He already owes Qu Moyu a lot of favors for his grandmother\u2019s treatment.\u201cI\u2019ll take credit for this. Mr. Qu didn\u2019t know that you took out a loan for this house. You told me about it that day and I told him about it casually. Mr. Qu asked me to do it.\u201d Cheng Ruoze winked his eyes, \u201cMr. Qu is so kind to you.\u201dShen Dai said sincerely: \u201cAssistant Cheng, thank you. You have helped me a lot. But I will discuss this matter with Mr. Qu first.\u201d\u201cWhat to discuss?\u201d Cheng Ruoze saw Shen Dai\u2019s concerns, he persuaded with a smile, \u201cthe money is all paid for, the bank will not refund it. Shen Gong, no matter what the reason is, you are now husband and wife. Mr. Qu treats you well. It\u2019s also a matter of course, taking care of his own omega is the alpha\u2019s duty, you really don\u2019t have to think about it.\u201dShen Dai had an unspeakable sense of happiness in his heart. No matter whether he dared to take Qu Moyu as his alpha or not, at this moment, Qu Moyu\u2019s kindness to him is real. He even boldly thought that maybe, maybe Qu Moyu also liked him. Maybe that\u2019s why he was so gentle to him, he needed him, she let him enter the master bedroom, he helped him with his grandmother\u2019s medical treatment and mortgage repayment for him.After all, when you love someone, you can\u2019t help being nice to them.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.05.23\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: Didn\u2019t have the time to proofread.

But Qu Moyu could be busy anywhere at this time. He also wouldn\u2019t go home so early.Shen Dai grabbed the phone and hesitated for half a minute but still sent a WeChat message to Qu Moyu: Are you busy? I\u2019m done with everything.After sending it, he regretted it. He was worried that he would disturb Qu Moyu while he was working.Seeing that he was about to arrive home, Shen Dai asked tentatively, \u201cAssistant Cheng, do you know where Mr. Qu is right now? Is he in the company?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take a look at his schedule.\u201d Cheng Ruoze opened the memo and looked at his watch again, \u201cRight now he should be in Huize Building, meeting a client.\u201d\u201cIs there a dinner party tonight?\u201d\u201cNo. I try to avoid arranging dinner parties lately. Alpha eats a lot before the susceptible period, so it\u2019s inconvenient for people to take notice of it at the dinner table.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d In this way, Qu Moyu should go home early so he would wait for him at home.Cheng Ruoze sent Shen Dai to Qu\u2019s house, and the two said goodbye. Shen Dai got out of the car and watched the business car that had just driven out turned around the corner to leave but turned back.Shen Dai thought that he had left something. The car window came down, Cheng Ruoze grinned: \u201cI just received a call from President Qu. He asked me to take you to him.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s eyes lit up, but he immediately realized that his surprised expression must look stupid. He hurriedly lowered his head and got into the car. After sitting firmly, he looked at his phone. Qu Moyu didn\u2019t reply to him, but he should have seen his message. The corners of his lips couldn\u2019t help but rise. Obviously, the two of them lived under the same roof and could meet at night but he would still be overjoyed to see his sweetheart a few hours earlier.The car drove to Huize Building. The two waited in the car for half an hour. Qu Moyu and a few subordinates walked out through the revolving door. Shen Dai was wondering why Lao Wu didn\u2019t come to pick him up. Qu Moyu walked over and got in the business car.Shen Dai looked at him with a smile: \u201cYou\u2019re done for the day?\u201dAs soon as Qu Moyu sat down, he inserted his fingers into the tie buckle and loosened the silk tie that had bound him for a day: \u201cI want to take you somewhere.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201dQu Moyu smiled mysteriously: \u201cLet\u2019s keep it a secret for now.\u201d\u201cMr. Qu, I\u2019ll leave first.\u201d Cheng Ruoze said respectfully.\u201cGo on. You worked hard today.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not hard work. See you tomorrow, Mr. Qu.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dCheng Ruoze and the driver got out of the car at the same time. Shen Dai looked at Qu Moyu quizzically.\u201cWe\u2019ll change the car and wait for Lao Wu to come over.\u201dShen Dai took Qu Moyu\u2019s hand, looked into his eyes and said softly, \u201cThank you very much for the house. But I have something to tell you.\u201dQu Moyu looked at him quietly.\u201cActually, I don\u2019t want such a gift. It will put a psychological burden on me. Maybe you think that I married you for You Xinghai\u2019s money and it\u2019s too hypocritical for me to say that it\u2019s not. But I just weighed the option because of my grandmother\u2019s health and that her old age is more important than my dignity. And now I have the ability to repay the mortgage and support my family at the same time as an adult. I should support my life by myself. I know you want to be good to me, I am very grateful for your kindness to me, okay? But you\u2019ve helped me enough.\u201d Shen Dai held Qu Moyu\u2019s hand with both hands and rubbed it carefully, \u201cOf course I want the career benefits you mentioned before, but I don\u2019t want to rely on you. I can get it myself. That is the future I want to achieve through hard work and I hope that when you give it to me one day, it is because I have that ability.\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s sharp eyes carefully explored the person in front of him. After several rounds of eye contact, he could only see magnanimity and sincerity in Shen Dai\u2019s eyes.There are two types of omegas around him. One is the bright profit-making, trying to get as much as possible from him when getting along with him. The other is with the morality of wanting to put a long line to catch big fish. He only rewards the sober former and he still plays around with the omegas he dislikes just for fun.But Shen Dai is an exception. From various meanings and perspectives, he is an exception. Shen Dai is the first person to be admired by him, and this appreciation is precisely regardless of gender. He purely appreciates him as a person, of social competitiveness, dual quotient, character and his way of life.He has been investigating Shen Dai. And now, the more he feels that this person is suitable to stay by his side for a long time.He held Shen Dai\u2019s hand instead, with a smile in his eyes: \u201cI understand what you mean. I also believe in your ability. At the same time, you can also calmly accept my kindness to you. But next time, I will ask your opinion first.\u201dShen Dai secretly breathed a sigh of relief. For the past few hours, he has been thinking about how to say these words so that he can express his thoughts without disappointing Qu Moyu. He knew that the money was just a small gift for Qu Moyu, but he tried his best to balance his self-esteem a little bit in this relationship. Even if he unilaterally loved an S-class alpha, this kind of extreme inequality is bound to be a test on his mentality. On the road to success, mentality determines victory or defeat\u2014whether it\u2019s about career or love.Shen Dai leaned over and kissed Qu Moyu. His eyes were full of smiles. Every time the waves flowed, he was full of affection that he dared not speak.Qu Moyu also kissed him on the cheek and the two smiled at each other.At this time, Lao Wu came. Qu Moyu said \u201cgo to the school\u201d.Half an hour later, Lao Wu drove to No. 1 Primary School.This school is well-known in the city and even in the whole country. It is one of the first primary schools to be established. It is located in the central area of a piece of land. There are old cadre buildings nearby. You can see guards on duty when you pass by the communities here. Regardless of its old campus, its enrollment rate ranks among the top three in the country, and those who can enter this school must either have top minds or have lots of money.\u201cThis is where you go to school?\u201d Shen Dai asked.\u201cHmm.\u201d Qu Moyu opened the car door, \u201cNo parking is allowed here. Let\u2019s go.\u201dThe two got out of the car, and Shen Dai asked curiously, \u201cAre you taking me to visit your alma mater?\u201d It\u2019s been a long time since school was over, and there were still three or five students on the road, with childish faces in front of them. After passing by, Shen Dai couldn\u2019t help but imagine Qu Moyu wearing this school uniform, looking like a young boy full of vitality.He really wanted to see it. He must have looked tender and cute. Maybe he was a little stubborn. Thinking about it, Shen Dai\u2019s heart is inexplicably excited.\u201cNo, we can\u2019t get in.\u201d Qu Moyu raised his chin across the street, \u201cI\u2019ve been craving beef noodles from that shop these days.\u201dShen Dai followed his gaze. It was an old noodle restaurant. It was not small in size, but the decoration was very simple. Since it was located opposite the school, the main consumer group must be students, so there were large stickers on the windows. The price tag is\u00a0 \u00a515 for one bowl of classic beef noodles.Shen Dai was stunned for a moment. He was used to Qu Moyu\u2019s breakfast with\u00a0 \u00a52,000 per gram of white truffle. He used a stove of more than\u00a0 \u00a5100,000 to cook vegetables. When he looked at the noodle restaurant, he would inevitably feel a sense of disbelief.When crossing the road, Qu Moyu naturally took Shen Dai\u2019s hand. Shen Dai stared at the back of Qu Moyu\u2019s head. He formed a happy smile on his face. He suddenly felt that Qu Moyu had a human touch to him.The two entered the noodle restaurant, and Qu Moyu skillfully asked for a bowl of beef noodles and added an extra portion of meat: \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cThe same as you.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t eat just one bowl. You can try other flavours.\u201d Qu Moyu thought about it carefully, \u201cThe beef with pickled cabbage is also delicious.\u201dShen Dai smiled and said, \u201cOkay.\u201dThe two found a corner and sat down. Qu Moyu looked around, \u201cThis place has been renovated several times and it is much cleaner than before.\u201d\u201cDid you eat here often when you were in school?\u201d\u201cOccasionally. My dad won\u2019t let me eat casually outside.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes seemed to be covered with a layer of mist and memories travelled in it, \u201cAt that time, the younger I was, the more he wouldn\u2019t let me eat outside. Naturally, it made me want to eat it more. This noodle is really delicious.\u201dThe two bowls of noodles came up to their table and Shen Dai hurriedly tasted it: \u201cWell, it\u2019s really delicious.\u201d The soup is fragrant and slightly spicy while the noodles are soft and tender. It is a good bowl of noodles.Qu Moyu also took a bite, with a faint smile on his face: \u201cThe taste hasn\u2019t changed at all. But when I was in school, it was only five yuan a bowl.\u201d\u201cDid you go to eat with your classmates?\u201d Shen Dai wanted to know more about Qu Moyu. When people revisited their nostalgic places, it was easy to open their hearts to the past.\u201cYes.\u201d Qu Moyu paused, \u201csometimes with my mother.\u201dShen Dai was surprised: \u201cMadam ate this too?\u201d In fact, he was even more surprised that the mother and son, who were now alienated like ordinary relatives, once had the experience of sitting together in a street shop eating noodles.\u201cI was still young at that time and my mother sometimes sent me to school.\u201d Qu Moyu glanced at Shen Dai, \u201cDo you think that my relationship with her is not like an ordinary mother and son?\u201dShen Dai didn\u2019t know how to answer. He didn\u2019t want Qu Moyu to think that he liked to inquire about his privacy, but he did have questions.\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like me.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s expression was as indifferent as he was describing the weather, \u201cIt\u2019s just that she had to take care of me when I was young.\u201dShen Dai stared blankly at Qu Moyu. After a long while, he asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d Why would someone dislike their own S-class alpha son?\u201cShe was pregnant with a beta girl before me and my dad forced her to get rid of it.\u201d There was a hint of sarcasm on Qu Moyu\u2019s face, \u201cAt that time, my uncle gave birth to an A-level alpha daughter. My dad couldn\u2019t accept it if his first child is a useless beta.\u201dShen Dai was silent. He suddenly understood where Madam Qu\u2019s grievances came from.However, Qu Moyu returned to his calm expression: \u201cI don\u2019t know why I want to eat these noodles today. The appetite before the susceptible period is very abnormal. It\u2019s really troublesome.\u201dShen Dai clenched his chopsticks. He wondered if that little Qu Moyu would be happy for a long time because he could eat a bowl of ordinary beef noodles with his mother before he became a powerful and cold S-class alpha.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.05.24\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: Thank you for all the \u2018good luck\u2019 wishes! I managed to send in two research papers. I hope I can let my prof be happy for a while hahaha.I can\u2019t help but understand how affected Qu Moyu is due to his upbringing. I think he is somewhat psychologically damaged as a child being treated coldly by his mother while his father put high expectations on him. No wonder he became so \u2018emotionless\u2019. -KPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He knew that alpha would have a surge in appetite on the eve of the susceptible period, but he had not been close to any alphas since he was a child. So he had never seen this side.After eating, the two walked around the No. 1 elementary school holding hands. Qu Moyu pointed to every street and told Shen Dai where the road led. He could also tell the names of more than one of the many nearby communities and buildings. He seems to be explaining to Shen Dai, but in fact, he is recalling his memory.Shen Dai listened with great interest and asked him about his childhood from time to time. Slowly, the figure of young Qu Moyu, whom he had never seen before, managed to conjure up in his mind.He felt that the distance between him and Qu Moyu, the distance between their hearts, had narrowed a lot.Taking advantage of Qu Moyu\u2019s good mood, Shen Dai timely advised him not to use drugs to shorten the susceptible period. After hundreds of years since the production of inhibitors, in addition to the strong version that needs to be injected, the ordinary version has fewer side effects and is easier to metabolise. But the drugs that are forcibly shortened or even blocked after the estrus or susceptible period which has begun, will always be a powerful medicine. He really didn\u2019t want Qu Moyu to use a way that would damage his body for a few days.Qu Moyu said solemnly: \u201cI have a lot of important meetings in the next period of time. I have to go on a business trip, and there are some people I want to meet. There are a lot of things to do. I don\u2019t want to take blocking medicine, so I can only watch the schedule.\u201d\u201cCan you predict when the susceptible period will be? Arrange your schedule accordingly.\u201d\u201cIt should be about three or four days, that is, around next week. If you don\u2019t know the exact time, you can\u2019t arrange the schedule accordingly.\u201dShen Dai was very helpless. He secretly clenched Qu Moyu\u2019s hand. He thought about when Qu Moyu came to eat this bowl of noodles and walked with him when he was so busy, he must be under too much pressure and needed a short period of time to destress. He also wanted to help the person he likes like how Qu Moyu had helped him, but he could only say a weak statement; \u201ceverything will be settled\u201d.\u201cWell, when these things are settled, I will take a good vacation.\u201d Qu Moyu asked, \u201cDo you still want to go to South Africa?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t go for the time being. My teacher is going back to China.\u201d Shen Dai smiled, \u201cHe couldn\u2019t wait any longer, saying that the food there was unpalatable.\u201d\u201cAlright. When Professor Liu comes back, I\u2019ll treat him to a meal.\u201dShen Dai couldn\u2019t hide his joy: \u201cOkay.\u201d His teacher is both a teacher and a father to him. Qu Moyu wants to invite his teacher to dinner, naturally because of him. This feeling is as if he was going to see his parents on purpose. How could he not be happy?Qu Moyu looked at his watch and glanced at the empty elementary school playground across the fence. After a while, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go back. I have a video conference tonight.\u201dShen Dai has been at work for the past two days, and has always been a little absent-minded. It was mainly because he is worried about Qu Moyu. He can\u2019t help but to have \u2018a bad feeling\u2019. He is a materialist atheist, of course. But at this time, he could not find a better phrase to describe this uneasy feeling he felt in his heart.In the afternoon, Shen Dai suddenly received a call from Shen Qin, saying that his grandmother was not feeling well. She was dizzy and nauseated. The tone of Shen Qin\u2019s voice sounded very anxious. He asked him to come back quickly. He immediately put down his work and took a taxi home.His grandmother was surprised to see him: \u201cWhy are you back? Don\u2019t you have work today?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you feeling unwell?\u201d Shen Dai went up and touched her forehead, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Have you caught a cold?\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s not a big deal. But it\u2019s just a bit of a headache. Maybe I watched too much TV. Why did you skip work on purpose?\u201d His grandmother said so, but she couldn\u2019t hide the smile on her face, \u201cThis way\u2026 Will your salary be deducted?\u201dShen Dai breathed a sigh of relief: \u201cIt\u2019s okay. My teacher is not around. I am the person in charge of the laboratory. No one will deduct my salary.\u201d\u201cMy baby is awesome. So excellent.\u201d Grandma took Shen Dai\u2019s hand, \u201cSince you\u2019re back, leave after dinner. During this time, you rarely come home.\u201dShen Dai feels a little guilty. Indeed, as his grandmother said, he is going home less often these days. One is because of Qu Moyu, and the other is because of Shen Qin. Moreover, his grandmother\u2019s health has stabilised. He often goes home on weekends. But he doesn\u2019t stay home overnight. He soothed her: \u201cI\u2019ve been too busy recently, I\u2019ll accompany you today.\u201dShen Qin came out with his bag on his back: \u201cYou guys chat first, I\u2019ll go shopping.\u201dThe two chatted and discussed what to do at night.After a while, Shen Dai habitually went to find his phone. There was often important content in the work group chat. He had to check it from time to time, but he couldn\u2019t find his phone after searching for a long time.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s my phone? Have you seen it?\u201d Shen Dai thought for a while, \u201cDid I put it on the shoe cabinet or coffee table when I entered the door?\u201d\u201cYou always leave things lying around.\u201d Grandma said, \u201cGo to my room and get my handphone to call.\u201dShen Dai dialled his own number using his grandmother\u2019s handphone, and then took the handphone around to hear the sound of his own ringtone. But he went around the small house and still couldn\u2019t find it. He was a little panicked, did he lose it? Left it in a taxi? But he clearly remembered that he took it home with him.Shen Dai continued to call, and when he called for the third time, the phone was connected. He hurriedly said: \u201cHello, hello, I\u2026\u201d\u201cAh Dai?\u201d It was Shen Qin\u2019s voice that came from the other line. He whispered, \u201cAiya, why is your handphone with me? I got it wrong when I went out?\u201dShen Dai let out a sigh of relief: \u201cIt\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t lose it.\u201d The two handphones are different models of the same brand. Except for the cameras, they do look quite similar.\u201cI didn\u2019t hear it when I was shopping. You wait a minute. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201dAfter Shen Qin came back, Shen Dai held his handphone in his hand and always felt that something was not right. But when he opened and looked at it, there was no problem. Maybe he only felt the nervousness of being spied on. It was impossible for Shen Qin to unlock his phone. He had neither money nor secrets in his phone.After having dinner with his grandmother, Shen Dai returned to Qu\u2019s house.Qu Moyu hasn\u2019t come home yet. Aunt Lan and Uncle Heng are packing some \u2018luggages\u2019 for Qu Moyu. They say they\u2019re \u2018luggages\u2019, but it\u2019s actually more like a small-scale move. There are four big boxes. At first glance, they must have been prepared for the safe house for Qu Moyu prepared for the susceptibility period.Shen Dai looked at the intricate daily necessities: \u201cWon\u2019t these be a little too much?\u201d\u201cNot much. I\u2019m afraid that the things the young master needs will not be available by then. And the young master will not be able to see people during those days.\u201d The two checked the list very seriously.\u201cThen\u2026do you need help?\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Aunt Lan thought of something again, \u201cOh, when the young master comes back, ask him if he needs to put some of your things. The pheromones of people close to him can comfort him, but\u2026 let\u2019s ask him first, okay?.\u201d Aunt Lan obviously remembered the time she was reprimanded for letting Shen Dai cook for Qu Moyu by herself.Shen Dai also remembered: \u201cOkay.\u201d He would never have asked before, but recently his relationship with Qu Moyu has continued to warm up, and he is a little more confident.After Shen Dai finished washing, he still helped them arrange things up for a while. The two frequently went in and out of the master bedroom to find stuff. He could neither read nor sleep.At this time, Qu Moyu also came back. He explained a few things to Aunt Lan. It seemed that the approaching susceptible period made him a little nervous.Suddenly, there was a crisp sound of a ringtone in the room. At first, there was no response from several people. After several rings and no one answered, Shen Dai realised that it was actually his own handphone that was ringing. He picked it up and saw that there was a call from an unknown number. But his mobile phone ringtone has always been the system default, and he has never set this unfamiliar ringtone.Qu Moyu slowly turned his head to look at Shen Dai. There\u2019s a stunned expression on his face. His eyes also became a little confused.Shen Dai answered the phone, but hung up after a few seconds of hearing nothing from the other end. Shen Dai was full of suspicion, but before he could put down the phone, it rang again. It was still the same unknown number and the same ringtone.Shen Dai answered the phone again. The other end hung up again. Shen Dai was annoyed and pulled the number into the blacklist. However, soon, the phone rang again. And the number was still an unknown number.There was a sudden groan in Qu Moyu\u2019s throat and he staggered two steps back from where he was standing.Uncle Heng first noticed his abnormality: \u201cMaster, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dThe phone kept ringing and it was useless for him to keep hanging up and blocking them. Shen Dai was so annoyed by this weird harassment that when he heard the sound, he also looked at Qu Moyu.Qu Moyu lowered his head. His face was getting paler and paler. The blue veins on his forehead were bulging and his facial muscles were trembling. It was as if he was holding something back.Almost in the next instant, the pheromones of ebony broke out of control. Before Shen Dai\u2019s brain had time to think, his own responding nerves and hormones had already responded first. His legs softened and he fell to the ground.At the same time, all the glass and ceramics in the room shattered! Sharp debris was scattered around. The house was in a mess, as if it had just experienced an explosion.He fell under a powerful pheromones control that he had never experienced before. The attack was overwhelming. It was like a hand grabbed Shen Dai\u2019s throat and threw him into a cold hell. He couldn\u2019t move and couldn\u2019t breathe. He stared at Qu Mo with wide eyes. Fear grows like vines in his heart. He had never suffered such real pheromone suppression in his life. He doesn\u2019t know how to describe the coldness, pain, fear and despair at this time. It was like he could not wait to just die.\u201cIt\u2019s over, it\u2019s over.\u201d Uncle Heng was so anxious that his eyes were red, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on!\u201dBeta is also not able to resist alpha\u2019s pheromone suppression, but it is not as sensitive as an omega. Although the two of them felt sick and wanted to vomit, they still could move. However, this is a crisis situation they have never encountered before. They felt overwhelmed. Qu Moyu suddenly entered his susceptible period!Qu Moyu knelt on the ground with a plop. His hands were on the ground. His will was obviously fighting against his own body. He took two steps forward, grabbed Shen Dai\u2019s phone, and crushed it. The crisp and harsh ringing stopped abruptly and he slowly raised his head, staring at Shen Dai with a pair of blood-red eyes.Fierce, hungry, cold, bloodthirsty\u2026 Those are what a pair of beast eyes looked as he waited for his prey.\u201cGo away\u2014\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s throat let out a muffled roar.Uncle Heng and Aunt Lan were already trembling with fear. They looked at each other, went up and pulled Shen Dai\u2019s arm, trying to drag him out of the room. But there was a lot of broken glass on the ground for them to avoid and Shen Dai was already soft like a pool of mud. He had almost lost all of his autonomy.Qu Moyu was like a beast stalking. He was lying on the ground but tensing the muscles of his whole body. His fingers scratched the cashmere carpet, his body trembled violently, and he kept whimpering roughly.Just when the two of them finally managed to drag Shen Dai to the door, Qu Moyu swooped up on him. He carried Shen Dai back with one hand and threw him roughly on the ground. Shen Dai\u2019s leg was scratched by broken glasses. But that pain was insignificant to him now. He was mostly overwhelmed by fear.Among the sound of screams by Uncle Heng and Aunt Lan, Qu Moyu covered himself over Shen Dai\u2019s body and shredded Shen Dai\u2019s clothes.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.05.25\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: Some people on weibo nicknamed QMY as \u2018six bowls of noodles\u2019 lololol.

Except for this voluntary trembling, all of his other autonomous bodily functions had failed.The most intense conflict with alpha in his life was when he was in his teens when he was blocked by a younger gangster asking for money and the suppression of low-concentration pheromones at the time was far from enough to make him obey his orders. But for the sake of avoiding trouble, he calmly gave his money away.He once thought that the suppression of pheromones was nothing more than this, until Qu Chengchen performed the \u2018fixation technique\u2019 quietly on him. But it was completely different from the powerful oppression at this moment. He knelt on the ground, surrendering his fate to this S-class alpha with every strand of his hair. He couldn\u2019t even think about why Qu Moyu suddenly entered the susceptible period, because the fear of dying had completely occupied his brain.The unbalanced pheromone stimulated Qu Moyu\u2019s downright bestiality. How dignified he was on weekdays, but how rude he was at this moment. The soft clothes were ripped apart under his hands. And he could not wait to spread Shen Dai\u2019s legs apart. The swollen, purplish-red thick and long fleshy blades slid to the tip of the soft hole.Shen Dai cried out in pain. This sound seemed to turn on the switch of his reaction nerve. The desire to survive made him squeeze out a little strength under the pressure of the suffocating pheromone. He tightened the plush carpet with both hands and crawled forward desperately to escape.The prey\u2019s attempt to escape under him angered Qu Moyu. He grabbed Shen Dai\u2019s neck and pressed it to the ground, forcing Shen Dai to lift his waist and hips high. Pressing his hard and hot dick against the shrinking flesh hole, he squeezed in hard. Shen Dai\u2019s body was tense and unprepared. Naturally, he couldn\u2019t get in. He kept twisting his body in pain. The strong desire to mate made Qu Moyu even more irritable. The fragrance of the ephemeral flowers that kept wafting in the air attracted him like a poison. He instinctively released pheromones to trap Shen Dai under him. There is only one thing to think about at this time \u2013 possession!No matter how much the body resisted, Shen Dai still fell into estrus under the coercion of such a powerful alpha pheromone. Thanks to the gene of all evil, the omega\u2019s body would obey his alpha without any bottom line in order to reproduce. He felt hot all over and blood rushed from his heart to his limbs, letting the boiling hormones control each of his nerves. The white and tender genitals were upright and the intestines automatically secreted intestinal juice. The back hole soon became wet and mushy and the hole shrank slightly as if \u2018inviting\u2019 to be invaded.Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes were red, he spread apart Shen Dai\u2019s buttocks and inserted his dick roughly. The tearing pain made Shen Dai arch his back convulsively, like a drawn bow. His face was as pale as paper, his eyes were round, and the sweat on his forehead was dripping down. The corners of his eyes were oozing tears out. Being softly wrapped and squeezed by the tight and hot corridors, lubricated by the sticky intestinal fluid, the pleasure pierced directly into the brain like an arrow. Qu Moyu finally found a way to relieve the swelling desire as he wished and hoop himself around Shen Dai. A piece of narrow and thin waist was slammed fiercely. Each attack was accompanied by the slap of the hip bone hitting the buttocks, swiftly and violently. His dick was terrifyingly thick, it was purplish red when it was congested, and the hideous thing wrapped in blue veins dragged back and forth in Shen Dai\u2019s intestinal wall like a burning stick, causing Shen Dai to scream again and again.After the hole was completely fucked, the pain was quickly replaced by an increasingly violent pleasure. Shen Dai\u2019s waist sank infinitely, pouted his ass like a cat, and took the initiative to present his wet and soft honey pussy to Qu Moyu. At the same time, he kept shrinking, trying to bite the meat blade that went in and out of him.\u201cMo Yu\u2026 Mo Yu\u2026 ah ah ah ah\u2013\u201d The thrill of the madness forced Shen Dai to cry, \u201cBite me, bite me, please, mark me, mark me\u2026\u201d At this time, he still remembered that Qu Moyu would not allow him to mention \u2018marking\u2019. But the brain occupied by lust only had the most primitive instinct so he humbly begged.Qu Moyu\u2019s five fingers pinched the red marks on Shen Dai\u2019s round and tender buttocks. His muscles were clearly lumpy. This most primitive thrust mobilised the strength of his whole body, causing his muscles to rise and fall like mountains. It was like a dormant beast charging up and leaping, exuding a deadly sense of power, he slammed into it madly. The attack was so fierce that it seemed to tear the people under him into shreds. His dick slammed into the soft flesh wall in the deepest part of the tunnel again and again. It\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t hear the omega\u2019s pleading. His canine teeth were already painful. But the remaining sense of reason was preventing him from entering the genital cavity, preventing him from impulsively thinking about completely possessing the person below him.Large drops of sweat dripped onto Shen Dai\u2019s narrow and fair back. His waist was full of red marks scratched by Qu Moyu. The two upturned buttocks were also hit like ripe peaches and his pussy was wet. They were smeared with mucus. It was fucked into a mess and that terrifying big dick was still poking in and out of it tirelessly.\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 ahhh ahhhh\u2026 bite me\u2026 ah\u2026\u201d Shen Dai cried and begged for mercy, he felt that he would be torn in half or drowned in the sea of lust by the mad wolf. The omega in estrus originally has an extremely strong sexual desire but when encountering alpha in the susceptible period, it is difficult to resist such plunder. Shen Dai\u2019s legs were so soft that he couldn\u2019t even kneel and his body fell straight to the ground.Lying next to him, Qu Moyu simply picked him up and threw him on the bed with his backhand. Shen Dai cried and shrank back but his ankle was pulled back by Qu Moyu.Shen Dai\u2019s red and swollen eyes suddenly found that the bedroom door had never been closed. Those voices\u2026 Did the sound of his cry spread to the whole house? No matter how chaotic his brain was, he also awakened a sense of shame: \u201cThe door, the door is not closed\u2026 Don\u2019t! Don\u2019t let\u2026 don\u2019t\u201dQu Moyu grabbed Shen Dai\u2019s calf and vigorously spread it apart, folded it and pressed it to his chest. All verbal or physical resistance was a provocation for the unsatisfied alpha. He opened Shen Dai\u2019s two long legs to the extreme. Letting that messy honey hole be exposed like an offering to the gods. He slammed his dick in from top to bottom mercilessly.\u201cAh ah-\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s tears welled up, screaming mixed with pain and joy, he felt like he was pierced by a sword. \u201cNo, no.\u201d Qu Moyu said the first sentence since the atrocity began. He leaned down and pressed the tip of his tall nose against Shen Dai\u2019s nose, \u201cI gave it to you. You must have it.\u201d He held Shen Dai\u2019s lips, sucked and grinded on it roughly. He stuck his tongue in and stirred wantonly, swallowing Shen Dai\u2019s body fluids together with the screams into his stomach. Shen Dai\u2019s dick were trembling and he had cum while he was fucked. But Qu Moyu\u2019s demands were far from over.Shen Dai\u2019s consciousness has become chaotic. He sometimes asks Qu Moyu to mark himself, and sometimes asks to close the door. He was afraid that even he himself did not know what he was talking about.After more than an hour of fucking, Qu Moyu finally ejaculated. Shen Dai\u2019s limbs were paralyzed and he stared at the ceiling sluggishly. Wet and sticky body fluids kept flowing out of his flesh hole. His face was covered with tears and his body was covered in fine sweat. He was a complete mess.Qu Moyu laid down crookedly beside Shen Dai, panting heavily, and then hugged Shen Dai into his arms like a toy. It was for fear that Shen Dai would run away. He wrapped using his hands and legs, changing his attitude from fierceness and rudeness to a loving and possessive lover. He repeatedly rubbed against him. Looking at Shen Dai\u2019s face, he sniffed behind his ears like a dog along his hairline, and whispered, \u201cWife, you are so fragrant. So fragrant. You smell so good.\u201dShen Dai was so tired that he couldn\u2019t even move his fingers. He was stunned and he was involuntarily attracted by Qu Moyu\u2019s gentleness. He also nestled into Qu Moyu\u2019s broad shoulders. Two pheromones amell lingering in his nose mixed with the scent of after sex. The smell is confusing.\u201cYou smell so good. You smell so good. Mine. You are mine\u2026\u201d Qu Moyu pressed the tip of his nose against the back of Shen Dai\u2019s neck. His voice became more and more hoarse. Although his words were incoherent, he was extremely honest, \u201cI want to bite. I really want to bite you. You are so fragrant. You are mine, right? You tell me. Tell me you are mine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m yours.\u201d Shen Dai responded with attachment. \u201cMine. Mine. That\u2019s great. You are my wife.\u201d Qu Moyu kissed Shen Dai\u2019s cheek and neck, \u201cI\u2019ll fuck you every day, okay? You lie in my arms like this every day, okay? You are not allowed to go anywhere. We will have sex and I will fuck you without doing anything else, okay? I will cum in your belly every day and I will cum in your mouth if it can\u2019t fill your stomach. Anyway, it\u2019s all yours. You give me a lot of children. Will you be a good wife?\u201dLosing civilization, losing knowledge, losing morals, losing etiquette, this is an alpha who only pays attention to physiological needs and has degenerated into a beast during the susceptible period.However, no matter how many absurd things the alpha says or does, the omega in estrus has only unconditional obedience: \u201cOkay, okay.\u201d\u201cSo good. My wife is so good. You are so fragrant, so fragrant.\u201d\u201cMo Yu, mark me. Mark me. Can you be my alpha?\u201d Shen Dai pleaded softly. The return of reason is short-lived, he knows that the current situation is wrong. He is wrong and Qu Moyu is also wrong. But the hot brain still encourages him to bow his head with the deepest desire to be marked. He really wants to be marked by the alpha that he loves the most!\u201cMine, mine, mine. You are mine\u2026\u201d Qu Moyu murmured. He stuck out his tongue and licked Shen Dai\u2019s glands, as if it could not only emit something that fascinated him. The fragrant ephemeral fragrance can also secrete sweet nectar. His canine teeth are itchy. He really wants to bite down. As long as he bites down, he can satisfy all his desires. But there is an invisible string that hangs his will. It physically prevents him from doing that. Why? Why can\u2019t he bite down? Why can\u2019t he take this sweet and delicious omega for himself? He likes this omega so much. If he can\u2019t bite, this omega might be taken away by others. Why can\u2019t he bite down?!Can\u2019t, can\u2019t, can\u2019t, absolutely can\u2019t!Why not?!Instinct and the special training he had received were in fierce confrontation. The two wills were pulling in Qu Moyu\u2019s brain. So he let out an irritable roar.Shen Dai was terrified. Qu Moyu hugged his own head and hid to the side. The muscles on his face were twisted. His eyes were bloodshot and red. He punched the head of the bed and smashed a big hole into the expensive ebony wood!He roared: \u201cWhy not?! Why not?!\u201dShen Dai couldn\u2019t help backing away until he reached the head of the bed. He looked around nervously. He then saw the door that had never been closed. How many people had listened to those unpleasant cries of his voice and Qu Moyu\u2019s roar? The door was wide open.The door made him feel extremely insecure.The door should be closed. Shen Dai\u2019s brain can only think in one line at this time. The result of his thinking is that the door must be closed. He got out of bed with a sore body and walked towards the door. This slight movement made Qu Moyu\u2019s irritable mood instantly disappear. He slowly turned his head and his dark pupils stared straight at Shen Dai\u2019s back, clearly walking towards the door step by step, away from himself. Huge fear and rage poured into his mind alternately. His omega was about to leave. His omega actually wanted to escape from him!Qu Moyu sprinted out of bed. Shen Dai, who didn\u2019t know that the danger was approaching, was knocked out by a huge force. He staggered and flew to the guardrail not far away. Then he was blocked by a tall and sturdy body behind him. He covered him, holding him in between the rail and causing him unable to move.Qu Moyu grabbed Shen Dai\u2019s jaw and forced him to look up at himself. His face changed instantly. A handsome face that everyone praised was terrifyingly distorted: \u201cYou dare to run. You dare to lie to me! You are mine! You dare to run!\u201d Shen Dai eagerly wanted to shake his head, but his chin was fixed by the iron pincer-like hand and he couldn\u2019t move: \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t run!\u201d\u201cYou are not allowed to run. You are mine and you are not allowed to go anywhere!\u201d Qu Moyu grabbed Shen Dai\u2019s struggling hand and pressed it on the handrail of the stairs. Right then and there he actually pushed his already stiff dick in while they were standing. Shen Dai\u2019s scream resounded throughout the entire villa. The reverberation echoed. He instinctively covered his mouth. His upper body stretched out of the guardrail and his lower body was fixed by Qu Moyu to withstand the heavier impact. He clearly saw it. Downstairs, a few figures flashed hurriedly. Tears mixed with pleasure and shame fell from the sky on him.\u201cWhere do you want to go? This is my territory. You can only stay in my territory!\u201d Qu Moyu wrapped his long arms around Shen Dai\u2019s waist and the meat blade frantically went in and out of the sticky and soft asshole. Shen Dai suppressed his cries from echoing all around. The feeling of making love at a public place was like looking down from the top of the mountains. It was as if the whole world had been turned upside down. The satisfaction of this double desire to conquer gave Qu Moyu a different kind of stimulation.It made him fuck faster and harded. He didn\u2019t allow Shen Dai to cover his mouth. He retreated shallowly and then fucked him hard to the end, hitting the soft genital cavity with each stroke, forcing Shen Dai to scream loudly in empty space house. His instincts are expanding rapidly, and his desires are unstoppable. He is a king in this world. Everyone needs to crawl under his feet. He only follows his heart and does not need to care about other things.Can\u2019t care about anything at all.He stared at Shen Dai\u2019s fair and slender neck with those blood-red beast eyes. He threw Shen Dai to the ground and forced Shen Dai to kneel on the cold hard wooden floor. Shen Dai wailed and begged. He didn\u2019t want to be here. This place was wrong. It was so open and unobstructed. It made him feel like a lamb surrounded by beasts.Qu Moyu held Shen Dai\u2019s shoulder and inserted his wet dick again. After dozens of violent insertions, the bloated meat head suddenly pressed against Shen Dai\u2019s genital cavity, which had already opened and closed like a mussel. Qu Moyu\u2019s body froze.Shen Dai realised something and stiffened all over. The original intense sex seemed to have been pressed on the pause button, and the sound of fucking stopped abruptly. Only the smell of pheromone mixed in the air was dragged from across the room all the way to the corridor, spreading everywhere.Qu Moyu tore off the tight string with his own hands. He straightened up. The meat head slammed into the heart of the acupuncture point and squeezed into the genital cavity. He quickly began to form knots.The sudden pain caused Shen Dai to collapse and cry. He struggled hard but he couldn\u2019t shake an alpha\u2019s determination to completely conquer him: \u201cIt hurts\u2026uh\u2026help me\u2026don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Shen Dai said. His knee was also painful but it couldn\u2019t compare to the pain of the alpha\u2019s dick forming a knot in the body.Qu Moyu grabbed Shen Dai\u2019s hair, forcing Shen Dai to reveal his flawless neck. He leaned down, sniffed the soul-sucking fragrance emanating from the glands, bared his teeth, and the sharp canine teeth were lightly ground, coveted Shen Dai\u2019s tragic and seductive appearance. The tip of his tongue licked his canine teeth lightly. His eyes were murderous. At the moment of thunder, he bit down hard, injecting his own pheromone into the omega\u2019s glands. At the same time, the knotted dick ejected powerful semen, implanted in the omega\u2019s reproductive cavity without a single drop out.Shen Dai let out a short cry of pain. His eyes widened. His body froze. It was as if his soul had been emptied in an instant. He had to endure the most important ritual in his life \u2013 being completely invaded in life and soul by a person who was originally a stranger and independent from himself.He passed out.\u201cBaby. Wife. Baby wife.\u201d There were whispers in his ears. Shen Dai was wrapped in a warm and thick embrace. His mind was unbelievably calm as he regained his consciousness. An unspeakable joy and satisfaction was felt in his heart. He slowly opened his eyes.A pair of deep and smiling eyes looked at himself quietly. His eyes were extremely gentle and a kiss fell immediately: \u201cAh Dai, you\u2019re awake. You\u2019ve slept for several hours, I\u2019m so bored.\u201dShen Dai recalled what happened before he fell into a coma. He subconsciously touched the back of his neck and found that hemostatic stickers had been pasted on the glands. There is a lot of food on the table. It\u2019s hard to imagine an S-class alpha in a susceptible period letting someone into a room unless there\u2019s a marked omega to appease him \u2013 it was because Qu Mo has him.Thinking that Qu Moyu had marked himself completely, Shen Dai was excited for a while. He could clearly feel the changes in his body. After being marked, he would feel the existence of another person so strongly. His pheromones were not only a single scent. The tranquil epiphyllum and the cold ebony are mixed together. You have me. I have you. The smell after the fusion is so elegant and beautiful. No matter where he goes from now on, his body will carry it with him. With Qu Moyu\u2019s imprint. He is Qu Moyu\u2019s omega.Shen Dai hugged Qu Moyu\u2019s neck, showing a loving smile. He then leaned into his arms. His nose was suddenly sour and there was an urge to cry. In fact, there is still unease in the bottom of his heart. But the joy of being united with the one he loves overshadows everything. He has never experienced such complete happiness. It was as beautiful and unreal as a dream.Qu Moyu kissed Shen Dai\u2019s forehead and put his big hand against Shen Dai\u2019s thin belly. He said excitedly, \u201cWill there be our baby here? There will definitely be one. It will be there soon. Will it be an alpha? Yes, is it an S-class alpha?\u201dShen Dai\u2019s expression froze. Will they have children? And will their children be recognized by Qu Moyu? But this concern was quickly erased by Qu Moyu\u2019s enthusiasm. Qu Moyu hugged Shen Dai and rubbed himself against him. He kissed him: \u201cBaby, are you hungry? If you are not hungry, we can do something else. You have been sleeping for so long, I really want to have sex.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s body was tired and hungry. But he couldn\u2019t stop his surging sexual desire. Qu Moyu touched him twice and he was wet again. In response to Qu Moyu\u2019s kiss, he whispered, \u201cI\u2019m hungry. \u201c\u201cHusband will take you to eat.\u201d Qu Moyu picked up Shen Dai and walked to the dining table. But instead of letting him sit on the chair, he supported his legs and let him sit on him while shoving his dick into Shen Dai\u2019s asshole. Shen Dai gasped for breath, trying to get used to the big dick inside him.Qu Moyu picked up a strawberry and stuffed it into Shen Dai\u2019s mouth: \u201cEat.\u201d He thrusted in roughly and smirked against Shen Dai\u2019s ear, \u201cEat more. Both up and down.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s elbows were against the dining table and Qu Moyu was playing with his lower body wantonly. He was screaming again and again. How could he still eat? But Qu Moyu liked this kind of teasing and forced him to eat while fucking him. The two spent seven extremely lewd and sweet days.It was the ultimate enjoyment and happiness that they had never experienced before. It was the pinnacle of both spiritual and physical satisfaction. For alphas and omegas, \u2018marking\u2019 is not just a physical bond contract. It is also the exchange of souls. They will develop deeper love and dependence on each other and will be affected by each other\u2019s emotions and information. It is almost impossible for infidelity to occur.Such a combination will be magnified ten times and a hundred times during the susceptible period and the estrus period, which is the bliss that everyone yearns for.=======***The author has something to say: Please be sure not to spread it publicly on any platform.

    "Chapter 47": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 47Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShen Dai slept for a long, deep sleep. He is too tired. When the estrus period ends, the hormone level returns from abnormal to normal. All the excessive physical strength during this period will be reversed to \u2018collect debt\u2019. Not to mention that he has endured the bottomless pit of S-class alpha\u2019s desire throughout the susceptible period.When he woke up, the blackout curtains in the room were closed, and Shen Dai had no idea if it was day or night. He turned over and grabbed his hand habitually to the side: \u201cMo Yu\u2026\u201dIt was empty.Shen Dai opened his eyes and saw that it was empty beside him. His palms on the bed, it was warm. But the mattress felt cold. It was obvious that the person had been away for a long time. Although he knew that Qu Moyu was awake, he couldn\u2019t help but feel lost. After all, every minute of the past week, Qu Moyu had been clinging to him for eating, sleeping, and bathing. He didn\u2019t leave him alone for a moment. His eyes followed him everywhere.Shen Dai had a strong sense of unreality about what had happened. He reached out and touched the back of his neck. The hemostatic sticker was already removed and the bite marks on the glands had scabbed over, which would leave traces there that could not be erased for a lifetime. Being able to clearly feel the existence of the ebony pheromone, his body and desire no longer belong to him. But even with many proofs, he still feels like it was all a dream.Qu Moyu had marked him.Qu Moyu had marked him?!Shen Dai couldn\u2019t help but put his hand on his flat abdomen. Will there already be their children here? During estrus, the pregnancy rate is extremely high. As long as you do not take contraceptive measures, it is a huge probability that you will be able to conceive. He and Qu Moyu\u2019s children\u2026 Just thinking about it has already made his heart surging. There is boundless tenderness in this thought.He was immersed in his emotions for a long time. As his brain became sober, his rationality gradually returned. He thought that he was forced into estrus. Uncle Heng should ask for leave for him. The sudden omega estrus is a normal event and the labour law stipulates that it does not devote to absenteeism. Has his grandmother contacted him these days? In case\u2026 Wait! Shen Dai suddenly remembered that his mobile phone was crushed by Qu Moyu.Shen Dai sat up from the bed. All the scenes that happened that night came to mind but he couldn\u2019t connect the strange ringtone with the sudden change of Qu Moyu. After all, it was beyond his cognitive system. He hugged his head and rubbed his hair. He decided to take a shower so that he could return to reality as soon as possible.Both his legs and waist were unbearably sore. The room that had been cleaned but it was still filled with eroticism. Thinking of the absurdity of these days, Shen Dai\u2019s face became hot.He slowly moved to the bathroom and when he took off his clothes and looked at himself in the mirror, he was covered in love marks. It was\u2026 simply unsightly. He quickly looked away and entered the shower.After taking a shower, he walked out while wiping his hair. The room was still dark and only the light diffused from the bathroom provided a faint brightness. He was about to go to the bed and turn on the light when he suddenly saw an unknown person on the sofa in the corner. There was a dark and tall silhouette of a person.Shen Dai was startled. He looked at the long, crossed legs: \u201cMo Yu? Why don\u2019t you turn on the lights?\u201dA hand stretched out to the lamp on the coffee table. His slender fingertips gently pressed the switch. His movements were slow and graceful, like a starter gesture falling on a piano key. Qu Moyu\u2019s expressionless face flickered under the halo. It was suddenly dark, making it impossible to see emotions. But his eyes were deep. His iris was like a circle of clenched gears and his pupils were the bottomless blue holes of the Bahamas, in which everything could be swallowed up.The bone-chilling chill attached to the spine and rushed all the way to the top of the skull. Shen Dai\u2019s body trembled slightly. He was more able to perceive Qu Moyu\u2019s mood swings than before, which meant that he was more easily affected than before.He was terrified.Holding a trace of expectation, he struggled and called out \u2018husband\u2019 as if to please him, eager for Qu Moyu to respond to him with enthusiasm and love like the past few days.Qu Moyu\u2019s response was to express his undisguised disgust with slightly twisted eyebrows. He picked up a transparent plastic bag from the coffee table, which contained a crushed mobile phone: \u201cDo you know the principle of doing this thing?\u201dShen Dai stared blankly at his phone, not sure if he understood Qu Moyu\u2019s question.\u201cThere is a device that can emit infrasound waves. The special ringtone is the trigger mechanism. People can only hear the ringtone and cannot hear the infrasound waves, but this infrasound wave can affect the endocrine.\u201d Qu Moyu said ironically, \u201cWhy? Qu Chengchen didn\u2019t explain the principle to you? Well, it is really unnecessary. It was developed by the military to deal with S-class alphas. Torture, interference, and attacks are quite powerful. And ordinary people will never be able to touch them for a lifetime.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s mind was blank. In his life, there were very few moments when he couldn\u2019t think at all. Many times, the more complicated the problem, the more he regarded it as a challenge. But not now. Now, he is very flustered.Qu Moyu stood up and walked towards Shen Dai step by step.The chill that invaded the bone marrow made Shen Dai stagger back two steps and then he couldn\u2019t move \u2013 Qu Moyu wouldn\u2019t let him move.Qu Moyu walked up to Shen Dai and looked down at the fair and handsome face, his heart was shaking uncontrollably. After all, in the past seven days, they had experienced the most fervent love in the world, leaving countless memories. Hot memories during the susceptible period. He would die without hesitation to protect his omega. But the susceptible period was over and he had sobered up. He held the mobile phone in the plastic bag next to Shen Dai\u2019s face, reminding himself to look at reality, not this face that is good at disguising. His voice was cold: \u201cDo you have anything to explain to me?\u201dShen Dai shook his head and whispered, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He didn\u2019t know what Qu Moyu was talking about. How could his cell phone have infrasound waves\u2026? He suddenly remembered that the afternoon of the incident, he was taking care of his grandmother. He summoned him to go home on the grounds of his grandmother not feeling well. Then, Shen Qin took his mobile phone away when he went out to buy vegetables. For more than an hour, Shen Qin\u2026 No, Shen Qin didn\u2019t have that kind of ability to do this alone. It must be Qu Chengchen!Shen Dai\u2019s pupils shrank violently. But in Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes, he was just looking for a way to protest.Shen Dai looked up at Qu Moyu and said in a panic, \u201cIt\u2019s not me. I don\u2019t know what happened to my phone\u2026 I went home that day, and my dad took my phone away. I don\u2019t know what infrasound is!\u201dShen Dai himself knew that such an explanation was too lame. But this was the whole truth. Seeing that Qu Moyu\u2019s expression became more and more gloomy, he hugged Qu Moyu\u2019s arm and released a pheromone in an attempt to appease his alpha. He said softly: \u201cMo Yu, listen to me. I\u2019m in a mess right now. You let this go\u2026\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s eyes showed a fierce light. He shook off Shen Dai\u2019s arm, grabbed the slender white neck with his big hand, and pushed Shen Dai against the wall. He gritted his teeth and said every word viciously. He suddenly said: \u201cYou, schemed. You schemed against me.\u201d The resentment of being betrayed by the person next to him made him angry and murderous. Confused by this omega\u2019s gentle and peaceful appearance, he repeatedly broke the rules and released his good intentions and pampered him. He has never been so obsessed with any omega. And he even had the idea of keeping him by his side for a long time. But it was this omega who quietly schemed with his enemies to set traps for himself!Shen Dai\u2019s cold appearance, smiling appearance, and emotional appearance kept appearing in front of him. Those beautiful pictures of them getting along turned into silent films playing in his mind, overlapping with the Shen Dai in front of him. No, everything in his memory was false. This omega is so greedy, so mean, so cunning!His heart seemed to be grasped by an invisible hand. He couldn\u2019t understand such pain. He had never experienced such humiliation in his life. He hated it so much that he wanted to kill someone!\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Shen Dai struggled to keep his feet to the ground. The pain that he couldn\u2019t breathe made him let out a low whimper. He widened his eyes and looked at this man with bloodshot eyes and a ferocious expression in disbelief. His brows were filled with hatred for him. He was his alpha, the one who hugged him in all kinds of affection just yesterday. His alpha. This is his alpha!Clear tears flowed down his cheeks and Shen Dai realised the drastic change of stepping out of heaven and falling straight into hell.Qu Moyu threw him to the ground before Shen Dai was about to suffocate.Shen Dai covered his neck and coughed violently. His face flushed with tears. He slowly raised his head and said in a hoarse voice, \u201cI didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201dQu Moyu stretched out his suit pants, squatted down, and pinched Shen Dai\u2019s jaw: \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything? Didn\u2019t you use your estrus period to climb on me? Or did you not use the susceptible period to unite with my enemy to scheme against me to get my mark?\u201dShen Dai\u2019s heart was broken and he couldn\u2019t argue.\u201cYou\u2019re really smart. You\u2019re very good at disguising yourself. I guess you didn\u2019t read the book in vain.\u201d Qu Moyu squeezed his chin maliciously, \u201cNow think about it. How could there be so many coincidences? Maybe the lab accident four years ago, too. You deliberately set a trap, but I held back. But you were in estrus at the investor meeting again. You were sure I won\u2019t leave you alone. You really worked hard to get me to fall in love with you.\u201dShen Dai shook his head tremblingly. Even when Qu Moyu was wary of him in the early days, he never said such vicious and mean words. Qu Moyu was aloof and personable. He didn\u2019t even bother to speak ill of him. But now, he saw a strange and unfamiliar person. Perhaps this is the real Qu Moyu.\u201cDo you know what I\u2019ve lost in the past seven days? I marked an inferior omega who didn\u2019t deserve my mark at all. And it might even make him pregnant with my seed.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s knife-like gaze swept across Shen Dai\u2019s abdomen. \u201cUnder the influence of infrasound waves, the susceptibility period was three or four days earlier than predicted and my affairs have not been arranged yet. Qu Chengchen took advantage of this time to unite several forces to shorten the stock price and then buy back with large sums of money. Things have changed. But I\u2019m hiding at home like a beast and can\u2019t do anything except mating. If it wasn\u2019t for my dad\u2019s hard work to stabilise the overall situation, Qu Chengchen would probably have seized power!\u201dShen Dai stared blankly at Qu Moyu, his eyes filled with panic and despair.A beautiful dream turned into a nightmare.Qu Moyu stood up and looked condescendingly at Shen Dai, who was lying on the ground unable to move. Those eyes that were full of tenderness and love not long ago, were now looking at him like looking at something filthy: \u201cYou think you got what you want. You think you can control me with my mark. No one can control me. No one can fool me. You will pay the price.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So he arranged for a bodyguard to watch over him.Shen Dai was under house arrest in disguise. Although Qu Moyu didn\u2019t really restrict his personal freedom, he couldn\u2019t go to the company and he couldn\u2019t go home, because he had the mark of Qu Moyu on his body. He would immediately be noticed by his acquaintances. He will be exposed. So he couldn\u2019t go anywhere except stay at Qu\u2019s house.It took him half a day to drag his self-consciousness out of his extreme pain and shame to recognize the fact that he had fallen into a crisis. He had to calmly think about everything before and after, and how to solve the problems in front of him one by one.Qu Moyu\u2019s words are very hurtful, but they are based on misunderstanding and anger. Except for the malicious speculation about him because of the misunderstanding, Qu Moyu said long ago that he would not mark him. But now it\u2019s just that he expressed it in harsher words. Thinking from the standpoint of Qu Moyu, these stress responses are in line with human nature. He was the victim, but Qu Moyu was not the perpetrator. The culprits were Qu Chengchen and Shen Qin.Compared with sadness and self-pity, what he needs most now is his utmost calmness.The most urgent task is to prove his innocence and dispel the misunderstanding between them.Shen Dai bought a new mobile phone and the backup downloaded from the cloud storage was incomplete. He didn\u2019t have time to check which work data he had lost. All kinds of information were enough for him to reply for a while.There are only seven days of vacation during the estrus period and today is the eighth day. His teacher has returned from South Africa. He can only ask for a sick leave from the teacher and Cheng Zimei.His grandmother has also sent messages to inquire about him these days. The reason why she didn\u2019t worry about her grandson\u2019s sudden disappearance for a week is because she also knew that Shen Dai was in estrus and this news must have been told to her by Shen Qin. In addition, in order to control Shen Qin\u2019s problem of spending money indiscriminately, Shen Dai only transfers 1,000 yuan of daily necessities to Shen Qin a week while other expenses are calculated separately. Shen Qin did not find him even once this week. This is enough to prove that Shen Qin accepted Qu Chengchen\u2019s money and premeditatedly took his mobile phone.Shen Dai called her grandmother, made up some reasons to appease her and told her that he had to work overtime these days because he was in estrus. So he would not be able to go back to see her for a while. His grandmother expressed understanding and told him to pay attention to his body.Shen Dai asked again, \u201cWhat about him?\u201d When it came to Shen Qin, he felt an indescribable sense of hatred in his heart. Facing the use and betrayal of his close relatives, he didn\u2019t feel sad, only disgusted. This was repeatedly given to him and his family. The person who brought the disaster, his biological omega father, who was able to harm his parents for the so-called \u2018love\u2019 in the past, can now naturally betray his own son for the sake of profit. What made him despair the most was that there was an indelible blood tie between them. Shen Qin was like a blood-sucking tumour lying inside him and his grandmother. How to remove it without hurting the bones?\u201cWatching TV outside.\u201d Grandma said with a smile, \u201cHe took good care of me. Everything is fine at home, you don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s good.\u201d Shen Dai hadn\u2019t figured out how to deal with Shen Qin. His only concern was his grandmother.\u201cAh Dai.\u201d His grandmother\u2019s words sounded hesitant.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dHis grandmother lowered her voice and said, \u201cShen Qin has cried with me more than once, saying that you don\u2019t call him father and you are very cold to him. Grandma knows that you can\u2019t forgive him, but what has happened can\u2019t be changed. And life will go on. People still have to look forward. He now knows his mistakes and corrected them. Can you\u2026 give him a chance to make up for it?\u201dShen Dai gasped and clenched his hand into a fist. His grandmother would not know what this son who seemed to have \u2018corrected his mistakes\u2019 did to him. He couldn\u2019t bear to tell her that he was under financial pressure in the past. Now, he is under mental pressure, that\u2019s all it should be. It\u2019s a reward for his grandmother, who raised him carefully. But how can the suffocation and resentment in his heart be resolved?! He said coldly: \u201cI let him enter the house, I have already given him a chance. There is no more.\u201dAfter a moment of silence, his grandmother let out a long sigh.Shen Dai originally wanted to restore himself to his senses as soon as possible through work. But he sat in front of the computer for several hours without reading a single page of the material.The marked alpha and omega will have a deeper emotional interaction at the physiological level, which means that he cares more about Qu Moyu now. And Qu Moyu can also affect his emotions more. Being misunderstood, humiliated and reprimanded by his own alpha, what kind of taste is it? It makes people feel breathless depression for every second.He tried to get Qu Chengchen\u2019s phone number through You Baiyue but You Baiyue didn\u2019t reply to his WeChat. He also thought about asking Shen Qin to confront him. But for Qu Moyu, they were a father and son with one heart. And what Shen Qin did before, how can outsiders not know that he and Shen Qin have no family affection at all?He didn\u2019t know how to prove himself for a while.In the next few days, he hardly went out. He either slept or sat in front of the computer all day, but his work efficiency was extremely poor. When Uncle Heng or Aunt Lan came to bring him meals, their eyes became strange and indifferent. Sometimes the appearance of hesitating to speak made him even more reluctant to take half a step out of the door.He really wanted to talk to Qu Moyu, but Qu Moyu went out early and returned late every day. Or he didn\u2019t come back at all and he never found a chance.Later, he figured that Qu Moyu might be avoiding him on purpose, perhaps because he was afraid that he would release pheromones. With the marked connection, an alpha would naturally want to protect his omega. And the pheromone could become a means of emotional kidnapping.But he was so anxious that he couldn\u2019t wait any longer. He didn\u2019t want to be in this state all the time and he couldn\u2019t keep pretending to be sick and not going out. So that night, he sat in the living room and waited for Qu Moyu. No matter how late he would be back.Uncle Heng and Aunt Lan each came to persuade him three times, and the last time Uncle Heng\u2019s tone was a little rude: \u201cYou should know that the young master doesn\u2019t want to see you at all now. So don\u2019t provoke him in the young master\u2019s anger.\u201dShen Dai said calmly: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of procrastinating? If there is a problem, we should solve it. Besides, I can\u2019t stay out of the house all the time. I have a family, I have a job, and I have my own life.\u201d\u201cMaster can\u2019t let you go to the company.\u201d Uncle Heng said with a sullen face, \u201cHe won\u2019t let others know that he marked you.\u201dShen Dai pursed his lips. He knew that in the hearts of Uncle Heng and others, he had been convicted of being an \u2018inferior omega\u2019 who deliberately deceived Qu Moyu to get his mark. He said solemnly, \u201cThat\u2019s why I want to talk to him.\u201d\u201cIf you want to talk, you have to wait for the young master to calm down. Do you know how much damage you have caused him? He is busy every day now\u2026\u201dJust in time, Qu Moyu came back.Shen Dai thought he was mentally prepared, but when he came into contact with Qu Moyu\u2019s cold eyes, his heart couldn\u2019t stop falling. He forced himself to take two steps forward and said softly, \u201cMo Yu, can we talk?\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s eyes only stayed on Shen Dai\u2019s face for a very short time and he walked past him without slowing down.\u201cYou have to give me a chance to defend myself.\u201d Shen Dai turned around, looked at Qu Moyu\u2019s back and raised the volume of his voice.Qu Moyu left a sentence without looking back: \u201cGo to the study.\u201dShen Dai gritted his teeth and followed him upstairs.Qu Moyu took off his suit jacket and threw it on the table. He then sat in the chair, closed his eyes, and rubbed his slender fingers between his eyebrows.Shen Dai looked at Qu Moyu\u2019s tired appearance and felt uncontrollably distressed. Even though he was filled with resentment, he still couldn\u2019t help but want to care about his alpha.\u201cHurry up.\u201d Qu Moyu said impatiently.Shen Dai slightly sorted out his thoughts and said succinctly, \u201cI didn\u2019t do this. I didn\u2019t know any of it.\u201dQu Moyu slowly opened his eyes, looking at Shen Dai with some undisguised contempt.\u201cI know you don\u2019t believe it. I need a few minutes to explain the ins and outs.\u201d\u201cWho will benefit from this?\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s tone was full of sarcasm.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve always wanted my mark, yes?\u201dShen Dai lowered his eyes: \u201cYes. Every omega longs to be marked when they are in estrus. This is instinct.\u201d\u201cWhat about when you\u2019re not in estrus?\u201dShen Dai opened his mouth but the words were stuck in his throat. At any time, he longed to be marked by Qu Moyu. He longed to be liked by Qu Moyu. He longed to be recognized as the only one in this life by Qu Moyu. What was wrong with liking someone? And why did this feeling come? At this moment, it has become something that he can\u2019t even talk about.Shen Dai\u2019s silence made Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes turn darker.\u201cI\u2026 also want it.\u201d Shen Dai felt that something in his body was screaming to break through the invisible bondage. It had been suppressed for too long and had to be expressed to his heart\u2019s content. So he knew that now was not a good time to say that sentence but he still blurted it out, \u201cBecause I like you.\u201d At this moment, a huge wave was set off from his heart.Shen Dai mustered all his strength to confess, but Qu Moyu sneered. He stared blankly at Qu Moyu, suddenly feeling at a loss.\u201cYou \u2018like\u2019 me.\u201d Qu Moyu sneered, \u201cIs it anything new?\u201dA sharp pain came from Shen Dai\u2019s heart.\u201cWhich omega that is close to me that doesn\u2019t \u2018like\u2019 me.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s frowning eyebrows showed disgust, \u201c\u2018Like\u2019 is nothing amazing. It\u2019s just an ethereal emotion and it\u2019s just a delusional idea to use it to coerce me. In exchange for real money, you\u2019ve become stupid and greedy.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s body trembled lightly: \u201cYou, you already knew\u2026\u201d\u201cFrom the moment you asked me for my WeChat.\u201d Qu Moyu supported his face with one of his hands. His face indifferent, \u201cI have seen those eyes on countless omegas. Do you think you are well hidden?\u201dIt turned out that Qu Moyu had long known the secrets he thought he was keeping carefully. The tangle of wanting to get close and forcing him to distance himself, the emotions he tried to cover up when he was sad and jealous\u2026, in Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes, they were worthless.So, what kind of mentality does Qu Moyu hold? He beats him inside and out not to have unrealistic delusions about himself. He has expressed more than once that his future wife must be an S-class omega and also he regretted not being able to marry You Baiyue. The date of the two which turned into a dinner party with You Baiyue.Even if Qu Moyu knew his feelings for a long time, he didn\u2019t care if he would be sad or embarrassed. Because Qu Moyu didn\u2019t care about him in the first place.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.05.30\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: I survived translating through this chapter too!

    "Chapter 49": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTitle: \u9876\u7ea7\u63a0\u98df\u8005 (Alpha Predator)Author\uff1a\u6c34\u5343\u4e1e (ShuiQianCheng)Translator: K (@kin0monogatari)Protagonists \uff1a\u6c88\u5cb1 (Shen Dai -MC), \u77bf\u672b\u4e88 (Qu Moyu -ML)\u058d\u058d\u058dShen Dai\u2019s eyes quickly turned red and his lips trembled slightly. The sad and aggrieved appearance made Qu Moyu feel uncomfortable. Is the influence of pheromones really so powerful? The more Shen Dai could influence his emotions, the more he resisted.\u201cWell, it\u2019s nothing new.\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s voice trembled slightly. He thought that the confession was a grand burning, but Qu Moyu put his fire out lightly.The past few months of getting along with each other each day and night made him have some illusions. He thought that Qu Moyu also had feelings for him, even if it was very small and weak, at least no one else had it. He was still special. It\u2019s really whimsical of him to think so. What\u2019s so rare about an omega who likes Qu Moyu? What\u2019s so different about his feelings? Qu Moyu doesn\u2019t even like him back. So he doesn\u2019t care about what he likes, nor does he care about him at all. In Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes, it\u2019s just a kind of \u2018ethereal emotions\u2019.He has a mark of Qu Moyu\u2019s, has a marriage with him, and has an intimate relationship with him. But Qu Moyu still doesn\u2019t care about him. This is so disappointing. He used to sneer at the omega pheromone ranking standard. How ironic it is that he could feel inferior today because of it. He couldn\u2019t control himself not to think that if he was an S-class omega, if he was better, the result might be different.Qu Moyu looked away irritably, \u201cWhat else do you want to say?\u201dShen Dai took a deep breath and said hoarsely, \u201cI know you don\u2019t like me. And I know you\u2019re angry. But you can\u2019t convict me casually. Felons also have the right to defend themselves. Can you listen to my explanation?\u201dQu Moyu looked at Shen Dai sideways: \u201cSpeak.\u201d\u201cI went home on the afternoon of the 12th. My dad took my mobile phone out of the door. He said he took it wrongly. Obviously, my mobile phone was manipulated during that time.\u201d When he said this, Shen Dai was feeling extremely ashamed. No one wants to have a father like that but he has to lay out his family scandal for others to examine, \u201cMy omega father is a\u2026 very selfish person. He gave birth to me to coerce You Xinghai. He took his parents\u2019 property as collateral for his boyfriend, causing us to owe a huge debt. I never told him about our relationship but on the day of my grandma\u2019s surgery, he saw us outside the hospital together. Now, I don\u2019t know how to get to collaborate with Qu Chengchen but everything he does is for money.\u201dQu Moyu listened and narrowed his eyes.\u201cThis is all I know. The part that I don\u2019t know, I will investigate it myself.\u201d Shen Dai sniffed, holding back the tears in his eyes, \u201cI assure you, no matter if you believe me now or not. I believe that anything is possible. And there is a possibility that what I said is the truth and I don\u2019t want to be held accountable until there is concrete evidence.\u201dQu Moyu looked at Shen Dai coldly: \u201cYou are trying to convince me that you were framed by your biological father. Even if the two of you benefit from this incident at the same time?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Shen Dai said sternly, \u201cI did wish\u2026 to get your mark. But I will never use this method.\u201dQu Moyu snorted softly: \u201cI don\u2019t have time to deal with you right now. When I finish dealing with important matters, I will find out what role you played in the whole thing.\u201dShen Dai endured the heartache and said solemnly: \u201cI want to go home tomorrow. I want to face\u2026\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve told you that\u2026 you should not let anyone know that I marked you.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s expression was stern, and he couldn\u2019t say anything, \u201cI will grant you a long sick leave from the company.\u201dShen Dai narrowed his eyes: \u201cAm I going to be kept here forever?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cUntil when?!\u201d Shen Dai said sharply.\u201cUntil you wash off the mark.\u201dAfter saying these words, the two held their breaths at the same time and fell into silence.The mark is the double bond between their body and soul. Once formed, they will both resist emotionally to cut it off, just like the brain will instruct the body to protect the brain first. When Qu Moyu finished saying this, his heart felt the unspeakable bitterness. It also made Shen Dai\u2019s heart ache even more.His favourite person, his alpha\u2026 wants him to wash off the marks and clear all contact with him.Qu Moyu hid all his discomfort, suppressed his self-doubt, and only had coldness in his eyes: \u201cI have already communicated with the doctor. We can find out if you are pregnant within two weeks. If you are pregnant, just knock it off and then wash the mark.\u201dShen Dai staggered and took a step back, staring at Qu Moyu in disbelief. He felt like he had been burnt for a moment.Under the gaze of those eyes full of pain and despair, even Qu Moyu couldn\u2019t look him straight in the eye. He warned himself not to be soft-hearted and that it was just the influence of pheromones. How could the great Qu Moyu be at the mercy of others? He won\u2019t be coerced by pheromones and he won\u2019t let those who betray him get what they want.Shen Dai looked at Qu Moyu\u2019s taut jawline, which was as cold as a knife. Knowing that this person was absolutely serious, he said in a low voice, \u201cDon\u2019t do this to me.\u201d He didn\u2019t know if a small life had been conceived in his womb. But if there is, it is the child of him and Qu Moyu. They have a marriage, a mark, and a time when they had loved each other. How can Qu Moyu be so ruthless?!\u201cHave you forgotten the terms in the contract that you signed and confirmed with your own hands?\u201d The muscles on Qu Moyu\u2019s face trembled, as if he was holding something unimaginable back within him and it made him look a bit cruel, \u201cYou will not carry my child, you shouldn\u2019t get my mark. And if you want something that doesn\u2019t belong to you, you have to pay the price.\u201dShen Dai covered his abdomen subconsciously. He knew that using words would be useless and powerless. But at this moment, he didn\u2019t know how to resist the malice released by his beloved. After being marked, he will only like, depend on, and obey his alpha more than before. His genetic instinct tells him to surrender yet his brain tells him to resist. He gritted his teeth and pleaded, \u201cMo Yu, don\u2019t treat me like this.\u201dQu Moyu clenched his fists: \u201cI told you to do it. Don\u2019t let me repeat it a second time.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s chest heaved vigorously. His voice choked as he said: \u201cYou can\u2019t force me to wash the mark.\u201dQu Moyu stood up. His tall body, sharp eyes, and domineering S-class pheromones made him look threatening: \u201cI have a way to make you become \u2018voluntary\u2019.\u201d After speaking, he turned and walked into his bedroom. He ruthlessly slammed the door shut.Shen Dai stared at the door that was closed to him for a long time, until the temperature of his body was lost a little bit and he seemed to be frozen to death by this spring. He used to want to walk into this door with anticipation. And he already did that. He thought he had obtained permission to stay by Qu Moyu\u2019s side. But now the door is closed to him mercilessly. It was as if he had woken up from a dream and realised that all the good things have become unsightly.How could the person who saved him from one trouble after another, who took care of him tenderly, and walked around his alma mater holding his hand\u2026 be the same person who wronged him, humiliated him, forced him to kill his child, and washed his marks off?How could the person who saved him and the person who hurt him\u2026 The person who treated him gently and and the person who treated him cruelly\u2026 be the same person?!\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.05.31\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: I remember this is the part where I hated cuttlefish the most.

Please don\u2019t hate me that I give spoilers because trust me, it can spare you guys the agony that I went through. 1) Yes. Our Sundae got pregnant. 2) Our cuttlefish still want Sundae to abort the child. 3) They will divorce but this squid had the audacity to still call SD as \u2018my omega\u2019 and want to keep him as a mistress while he wanna marry someone else! GRRRRRR! 4) SD will receive help from someone you won\u2019t expect where he can still have the baby but managed to wash off the mark. I\u2019ll keep this not spoiled for you. This, you guys need to read yourself to know. I cried during that chapter. 5) Sundae managed to escape QMY and go off to a land far, far away where he will be spending time with our 2nd male lead.

His sadness and anger were constantly interfering with his thinking. They were dragging him into the quagmire of anxiety. He sometimes thought of Qu Moyu and the look in his eyes. Also the words he said to him. His tears would fall without warning.He really wanted to just sleep, to see if he would wake up and find that this is all just a nightmare.And Qu Moyu would still hold him and not let him go. And he would tell him those things he would only say during the susceptible period. Those silly but sweet words. But he couldn\u2019t sleep. He couldn\u2019t sleep night after night.In the torment of counting the seconds that passed by, he managed to determine two things. Firstly, he really loves Qu Moyu. No matter how the mark came about, they have become something unforgettable to each other for a lifetime. The impact of the mark on people has a strength that is no less than imprinted in blood. Even if it is two completely estranged alpha and omega, after marking, they will gradually fall in love with each other. He has an absolute advantage and cannot give up the possibility of Qu Moyu falling in love with him at this time. Secondly, they have been together for more than half a year. People normally will have feelings. Qu Moyu\u2019s only acting this way now mostly out of misunderstanding. As long as he can prove his innocence, as long as the misunderstanding is resolved, Qu Moyu won\u2019t be so ruthless.Shen Dai repeatedly recited in his heart that he should be result-oriented and he should solve this problem.He got up from the bed, took a cold shower, prepared a recorder and called Shen Qin.After the phone rang for a long time before answering, Shen Qin said \u201cHello\u201d very softly, unable to hide his guilty conscience.\u201cHow did you and Qu Chengchen know each other?\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s voice was cold and he went straight to the topic without saying a word of nonsense.Shen Qin whispered: \u201cThe last time I went to find You Xinghai, he happened to be there.\u201d\u201cHow did you know Qu Moyu\u2019s identity?\u201d\u201cWhen the founder of Xingzhou died, I saw his car on TV.\u201d\u201cHave you thought about the consequences of doing this?\u201d Shen Dai slowly clenched his fists. It might be a good thing not to meet him. If Shen Qin stood in front of him now, he didn\u2019t know if he would be able to control himself.\u201cI did it for\u2026\u201dShen Dai roared: \u201cYou dare to say it\u2019s for my good!\u201dThere were a few rapid breaths on the other end of the phone: \u201cYou and him are married. Don\u2019t you want him to mark you?\u201d Shen Qin changed from his previous submissiveness and his voice became sharp, \u201cYou should really thank me. I\u2019ve got you into the boat of an heir. Is it possible for you as a B-level omega to get an S-level alpha\u2019s mark in this life? I am your father. Whether it is for you or for me, it is the same thing!\u201dShen Dai was trembling with anger: \u201cThe mark obtained by this method will ruin my relationship with him! Have you ever thought about it? You don\u2019t care at all. You only care about yourself!\u201d\u201cAs long as there is a mark, everything will be okay.\u201d Shen Qin said excitedly, \u201cAh Dai, listen to me. He will soften your heart. The longer the mark is there, the deeper the impact will be. When you have his child, he can\u2019t do anything to you and you will have everything in the future.\u201dShen Dai said coldly, \u201cYou thought so too back then.\u201dThere was silence on the other end of the phone.\u201cYou didn\u2019t get You Xinghai\u2019s mark. So you wanted to blackmail him through me. In the end, you didn\u2019t get anything except me as a burden.\u201d Shen Dai closed his eyes in pain. He thought he would not do this again. Shen Qin shed a tear, but at this moment, the wound of him being neglected by his biological father in his childhood when he needed love the most was opened again. He gritted his teeth, \u201cYou ruined your life. And you want to ruin mine!\u201dHe wanted Qu Moyu\u2019s mark when they were in love with each other. Originally, he was approaching Qu Moyu\u2019s heart step by step. Step by step getting into the door. But now it was severely closed in front of him.Shen Qin choked and said, \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to end up like me. If I had a mark, how could I end up like this?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t be like you.\u201d Shen Dai wiped his wet eyes, \u201cI\u2019ll never be like you.\u201dAfter hanging up the phone, Shen Dai slumped in the chair. He was unable to calm down for a while.Because of Shen Qin\u2019s previous experience, he has always rejected omega\u2019s behaviour of wanting to bind alpha through a marking. He thinks that it is against human\u2019s will and physical binding does not mean one can achieve happiness. But Shen Qin does not have this sobriety. Shen Qin felt that all the failures and misfortunes in his life stemmed from not getting an alpha\u2019s mark.Shen Qin is sad and hateful. But his judgement on the influence of \u2018marking\u2019 on people is not wrong \u2013 at least its\u2019 influence on omega is huge.Before he was marked, Shen Dai was docile and obedient due to Qu Moyu\u2019s identity and genes. But he hid his self-esteem and arrogance in his bones. It should be the promise that comes naturally, otherwise it is like putting the cart before the horse. But after being marked, he developed a strong psychological dependence on his alpha. When he thought of Qu Moyu asking him to wash off the marking, he was overwhelmed with discomfort.He calmed down for a while and then sent another WeChat message to You Baiyue: Give me Qu Chengchen\u2019s number and you can \u201cuse\u201d me at the right time in the future. This is why you insist on establishing contact with me.He didn\u2019t know how much You Baiyue had calculated this in his heart, but obviously he had a certain value in You Baiyue\u2019s eyes.Sure enough, after a while, You Baiyue called.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to give it to you, but it\u2019s useless to do so.\u201d You Baiyue\u2019s voice was lazy and indifferent, \u201cThe two brothers are so busy that their feet are barely touching the ground now, so how can they bother with you?\u201d\u201cHe hurt me like this, I have to\u2026\u201d\u201cStop, stop.\u201d You Baiyue \u2018tsk tsk\u2019 twice, \u201cIf you haven\u2019t seen the world, you should be more sober. You want to call Qu Chengchen, what do you want him to do for you? You are just a lost piece of chess for him. He won\u2019t do anything for you. What can you do to him?\u201dShen Dai\u2019s chest heaved vigorously and his eyes were filled with resentment. But he was blocked by You Baiyue and had nothing to say. That\u2019s right, what can he do to Qu Chengchen?You Baiyue sighed: \u201cYou are wronged now and you want to prove your innocence. Let me tell you, your innocence is not important to them at all. Money is important. Stocks are important. Power is important. And you are not important. If Brother Yu knows that you didn\u2019t do it, so what? Isn\u2019t it your reason for those losses that made Brother Yu so devastated? \u201cShen Dai wanted to argue, wanted to say that it couldn\u2019t be counted like that, but he couldn\u2019t speak when he opened his mouth. He resisted every word of You Baiyue, but he knew that they were most likely the truth.\u201cHey, let me advise you and give you some sober tips.\u201d You Baiyue rolled over, \u201cI\u2019ve seen many omegas of your type. Never been in love, idealistic, strong self-esteem\u2026 So called \u2018I think I can pass those common marriage and love patterns and find my beloved alpha for a lifetime\u2019.\u201d He said this in a very contemptuous tone, \u201cI told you a long time ago that S-class alphas have no feelings. Although I am right that the details of your relationship are not clear, I can fully guess the state of the two of you now. Brother Yu is very good to you. He is gentle and considerate today and he will give you something the next day. He would probably touch your head and give you a snack. But it\u2019s not because the pet pleases the owner. What if the pet bites?\u201dShen Dai\u2019s complexion sank a little bit and he suddenly felt a chill down his back. But it is a warm spring day. It seemed like he had stepped back into the cold winter.\u201cIn the end, you are still inexperienced. And you lack the understanding of the alpha species. So you are full of unrealistic fantasies. If I tell you this, you may not want to believe it. You have to step on the thunder to understand. When you touch the core interests of an alpha, how fast they changed their faces, you should have experienced it these days.\u201dYou Baiyue spoke lightly, but it fell heavily on Shen Dai\u2019s shoulders.\u201cIt is due to my conscience that I advise you that if you get pregnant with a child, you will definitely give birth to the child. But after giving birth, listen to Brother Yu, just wash off the mark and don\u2019t fight him. As long as you follow him and have a sweet mouth, you can still have hope to stay by his side. And even if you can\u2019t stay by his side, at least you and your descendant will be able to reach the sky one step ahead in this life. This is already the best result so don\u2019t expect anything else. \u201cShen Dai spoke, his voice flat and quiet: \u201cYou Baiyue, we are different. Our backgrounds, perceptions, and advantages are all different. So our concepts and choices are also different. I don\u2019t need to educate you and I don\u2019t need your education. I have fantasies about feelings, but I have no fantasies about living such a life. We are just the opposite of each other. You think you can pin your life on others while I think I can pin my feelings on others. What\u2019s the difference? Is it wrong? Even if my relationship collapses, my life will not fall apart. But on the other hand, how can you be so sure that you can rely on others to enjoy a lifetime of prosperity and wealth?\u201dThis time, it was You Baiyue\u2019s turn to be silent.\u201cWe want very different things, so your \u2018advice\u2019 doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201dYou Baiyue smiled helplessly: \u201cIndeed. But you will understand sooner or later.\u201dShen Dai hung up the phone and stared blankly at the empty white wall.When he refuted You Baiyue, he was full of confidence. But how could he not have doubts in his heart that his expectation of love is really just an unrealistic fantasy? And that was all just because the person he likes is an S-class alpha?\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.06.01\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: I\u2019m really tortured as I translate this.

After rejecting the teacher\u2019s and Cheng Zimei\u2019s requests to visit the sick twice, they all felt that something was up with him.One day, Professor Liu Xi called Shen Dai. Shen Dai felt guilty when he saw the number on his phone. He didn\u2019t want to lie to the teacher at all, but he didn\u2019t dare to tell the truth either.\u201cAh Dai, are you feeling better?

And then I realised that you and Xiao Qu had fallen in love while for other things, she said I should ask you myself.\u201dShen Dai felt that the three words \u201cfall in love\u201d were like three loud slaps on the face. They did not \u201cfall in love\u201d at all. The current situation was simply worse than that of a simple bed partner. His admiration was shady. Then their agreed marriage was broken. And now his mark was also broken. Between them, the bridge seems to be the same one after another, getting deeper and deeper, but in fact, as long as Qu Moyu turns around, it means nothing at all. He spoke with difficulty and said in a low voice, \u201cTeacher, I signed a non-disclosure agreement. I didn\u2019t lie to you on purpose.\u201d\u201cYour estrus period coincides with Mr. Qu\u2019s susceptibility period. And you immediately ask for sick leave. Don\u2019t underestimate the IQ of a normal person. There are a lot of rumours in the company now. So tell the teacher the truth. Are you pregnant?\u201d\u201c\u2026Not sure yet.\u201dLiu Xi sighed heavily: \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I should be happy for you or not. But listening to your tone and state. I don\u2019t think it seems to be very good.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s nose was sore. He suddenly had the urge to cry. In his mind, the teacher was the person closest to a father in the world. When he was in the most difficult time, it was the teacher who helped him. He was full of sadness and grievances. He wanted to pour out his thoughts to the person he respected the most, but he didn\u2019t have the qualifications. And he didn\u2019t want to cause trouble to others.His silence further verified some of Liu Xi\u2019s conjectures. Liu Xi said gently: \u201cAh Dai, I don\u2019t know about your relationship and I don\u2019t want to ask too much. But I want to remind you that the S-class alpha is very, very different from us. In the same way, don\u2019t speculate on normal people\u2019s values and emotional models. I hope you can protect yourself, keep your head clear, and remember what your mindset is based on.\u201dShen Dai said hoarsely: \u201cI understand, teacher. Thank you.\u201d Of course he understood. But the gap between knowing and doing is a high wall that human beings find difficult to cross in their entire lives.Not long after the call with the teacher, Qu Moyu\u2019s family doctor came and drew a little blood on Shen Dai. Shen Dai cooperated silently. When the doctor was about to leave, he asked, \u201cWhen will it be found out?\u201dThe doctor glanced at Shen Dai, but did not answer. He just nodded politely, took the medicine box and left.Shen Dai took out half of the financial news he had seen and continued to read. It was a manuscript about Xingzhou\u2019s recent equity turmoil and industry analysis. The article said that due to the downturn in the rare earth industry in recent years and the huge amount of investment and research funds. Qu Chengchen\u2019s ambition to change the strategic direction of the group has been supported by several shareholders. Wave after wave, within a week when Qu Moyu had to disappear because of the susceptible period, Qu Chengchen launched a very violent attack. Although he failed in the end, it also caused Qu Moyu to suffer heavy losses. There are various speculations and analyses in the battle. One of the important cards in Qu Moyu\u2019s hand is the acquisition of Chuanghai. However, due to Chuanghai\u2019s debt and the pain point that the acquired mine cannot be profitable in the short term, it is now full of variables. Once the merger case fails, Qu Chengchen is likely to get more support votes in the board of directors. So what is waiting for Qu Moyu is to lose the helm.This is a bloodless and brutal war.That night, Qu Moyu came back very early. It is the earliest ever for him to come home during this time. And it was the first time he took the initiative to see Shen Dai.Shen Dai felt that Qu Moyu had been resisting seeing him. One was that his anger had not subsided. And the other was that he was worried that he would be influenced by the advantage of the marked pheromones. Shen Dai felt that Qu Moyu might have thought too much. After learning those cruel words, it seemed that only himself could be affected.Shen Dai still had some extravagant thoughts in his heart where he hoped to clear up the misunderstanding with Qu Moyu. After all, they were fine before all this happened. He took the recording of him and Shen Qin to Qu Moyu\u2019s study. However, the moment he saw Lawyer Chen sitting on the sofa, his heart was completely chilled. There was a terrible foreboding.Qu Moyu\u2019s attitude was no longer cruel and angry. The only expression on his face was that he had no expression. There was only the throbbing pupil full of light which conveyed extreme indifference.Shen Dai looked at Qu Moyu, and then at Lawyer Chen. In the short walk from the second floor to the third floor, he thought about what to say countless times, how to defend himself, and how to make Qu Mo believe that he is really innocent. But now he can\u2019t say a word. This is because he knows that he was summoned to this room to stand for a trial.\u201cSit down.\u201d Qu Moyu said.Shen Dai didn\u2019t sit. He forced himself to look directly at Qu Moyu and asked a question that made his heart tremble: \u201cIs the blood test result out?\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s eyebrows twitched. He subconsciously didn\u2019t want to answer this question. But it was something he had to answer. He glanced at Shen Dai\u2019s abdomen and nodded.At that moment, Shen Dai only felt that his eyes were dazzled. He revolved in the infinite world and spun frantically. He was thrown into the sky and then smashed to the ground. He relied on the pain of depravity to regain his sanity. Although he was well prepared, even though he knew that this was a high probability event, when he confirmed that he really had a child, his life was shaken violently.He couldn\u2019t describe the mood at the moment. The saddest thing is that he has a child with the person he loves. But in the future he looks forward to, there is no joy in welcoming the new life. There was only a cloud of chaos.Shen Dai fixedly looked at Qu Moyu. There was pain, pleading, and a faint hope in his eyes. He was waiting for his own judgement, but he hoped that the executioner would be kind.Qu Moyu felt an unfamiliar pain with his internal organs falling straight down. He secretly adjusted his breathing and refused to meet Shen Dai\u2019s eyes.Lawyer Chen is very good at observing words and expressions. After all, he earns money to solve problems for the boss. He coughed lightly and said in a formulaic tone: \u201cMr. Shen, I drafted the prenuptial agreement between you and Mr. Qu. I believe we all remember that in the contract, there are very clear terms in it, you can never give birth to Mr. Qu\u2019s descendants. If you do, you have breached the contract.\u201dBreach of contract.Shen Dai searched all over his memory, but he couldn\u2019t seem to find the words that were colder than this \u2013 when they were used to describe a sprouting little life in his belly. Shen Dai slowly clenched his fists and stared at Qu Moyu with tears in his eyes: \u201cIs this just my responsibility?\u201dQu Moyu narrowed his eyes.\u201cWe do not discuss the attribution of responsibility. Because it is not within the scope of the contract. This is only the established facts.\u201d Lawyer Chen said.Shen Dai\u2019s body trembled uncontrollably, struggling to the death: \u201cI have a recording with Shen Qin, I didn\u2019t plot against you. I can also confront Qu Chengchen, I\u2026\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes were full of frost, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you did it or not. But then you have to do exactly as I told you to do.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t matter? His innocence doesn\u2019t matter? His personality doesn\u2019t matter? His dignity doesn\u2019t matter?!Lawyer Chen took out a frighteningly thick stack of documents from his briefcase: \u201cToday, I hope Mr. Shen can cooperate with me to complete the signing of the divorce agreement and the property division agreement. As long as you cooperate, Mr. Qu will not hold you accountable for your breach of contract.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s tears fell down his cheeks. His heart seemed to have been stabbed again and again. He bowed slightly and he was almost unable to stand in pain.Qu Moyu\u2019s hand clenched the armrest of the chair secretly. He felt his pheromones rushing around in his body. He had to control this force with all his mind. Controlling his pheromone was an alpha\u2019s lifelong practice, but when he saw Shen Dai\u2019s tears, he almost lost control. He wanted Lawyer Chen to shut up. He wanted his omega to stop crying. He wanted everything to return to the way it was before. But at the same time, a calm voice in his brain told him why he was unbearable and uncomfortable. And also why he was reluctant to give up. It was all the works of the \u2018mark\u2019. As long as there is no \u2018mark\u2019, there is no reason for him to be affected by a mere omega.\u201cAfter signing these agreements, I will arrange for you to go tomorrow to\u2026\u201d At this moment, lawyer Chen\u2019s humanity narrowly surpassed his professionalism and he couldn\u2019t say the cruellest words, \u201c\u2026to deal with the breach of contract and to clean the \u2018mark\u2019 at the same time.\u201dShen Dai looked at Qu Moyu from beginning to end. He wanted to see with his own eyes how his alpha would deal with him. And to see if the person he loved, the one who had rescued him from danger and gave him the light of hope several times, was this his true face? This person has the heart to push him into hell.Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t see the slightest emotion on Qu Moyu\u2019s face. The person who once treated him tenderly and lovingly had the exact same face as the person in front of him.Qu Moyu was flustered by Shen Dai\u2019s desperate eyes, but the more he felt Shen Dai\u2019s influence on him, the more he wanted to resist. Being coerced by omega\u2019s marks or emotions made him abhorred. No one could control him. No one can coerce him. No one!Qu Moyu forced himself to stare into Shen Dai\u2019s eyes. The powerful alpha pheromone armed his emotions, making him firm and decisive, he said solemnly: \u201cSign it. Do as I say. I will give you financial compensation.\u201dShen Dai strongly supported his swaying body. He walked over and picked up the pen without hesitation.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.06.03\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: T.T\u2026 I hate QMY. I need time to adjust my emotions.

From here, he can see most of the front courtyard of Qu\u2019s house. Qu Moyu\u2019s car will pass by here sooner or later. When he first arrived at Qu\u2019s house, he would work every night while paying attention to the sound of the engine. Whenever he heard that Qu Moyu was back, he went to this position, opened a gap in the curtains, and secretly watched Qu Moyu get out of the car. Even if it was just for a short time, he felt very satisfied. After all, he could only feel lucky to just take a look from a distance all these years.Since when did he become more and more greedy?Qu Moyu said that since he asked for WeChat for the first time, he could already see his thoughts. At that time, although he had desires, he still had reason. He always wanted to approach, but he was very restrained in his behaviour. It would be great if they could stay just like at that time. With his mind, it was enough to deal with the little frustration of not being able to be with his crush. But then they got closer and closer. He got deeper and deeper. He wanted more and more. He seemed to be driving a car with a brake failure and rushed forward, knowing that as long as he didn\u2019t slow down, even a little pothole could cause a huge accident.Sure enough, everything got out of hand and then fell apart.He couldn\u2019t believe that they would become like this overnight. And that Qu Moyu would be so ruthless. He also couldn\u2019t believe that he would let himself fall into such an unbearable situation.He lowered his head, looked at his flat stomach, and gently put his palms on it. Even though there\u2019s nothing visible yet, he seemed to have \u2018touched\u2019 the existence of a new life. This feeling is amazing. He wonders if he really can give birth to another human being?He witnessed Shen Qin\u2019s misfortune for most of his life. He felt that the most impossible thing he could do in his life was to have a child out of wedlock. Naturally, he was a child who was not expected to be born. But what he encountered now was worse than having a child out of wedlock. He and his alpha used to look forward to this child with joy, but later found out that it was just the hormones during the susceptible period. When he wrote his name on the divorce agreement, every stroke was like a knife gouging out in his heart.Qu Moyu\u2019s ruthless look in his eyes was like a pair of fierce beast eyes, hovered lingeringly in his mind. They were determination, resentment and impatience all at once flashing in the bright pupil light. But one thing for certain, there was no emotion in them. It\u2019s ridiculous that he still holds a glimmer of hope, thinking that the two of them just had a misunderstanding. As long as the misunderstanding is resolved, they can be reconciled as before. How clearly Qu Moyu had said it. The truth is not important at all. It was not important. The only important thing is that he is not worthy of obtaining the mark of an S-class alpha. He is not worthy of giving birth to descendants of an S-class alpha. So even if he is innocent, when Qu Moyu sobered up, what awaits him will still be the divorce agreement and the decision to \u2018deal with the breach of contract\u2019.He is too self-sufficient. You Baiyue is right. How could he think that he can impress an S-class alpha? How could he take the gentleness of Qu Moyu as a clue of his liking towards him? How could he take what the alpha in the susceptible period said as a promise?But apart from overestimating his abilities and liking someone he shouldn\u2019t like, he didn\u2019t do any evil. So why should he be punished like this? Why did Qu Moyu treat him like this?!It\u2019s time to put an end to this. According to the script he envisioned at the beginning, he would have an agreed marriage with a person he had never met and he would get the money to repay the debt. If this person were not Qu Moyu, there would be no extra troubles, and he would not end up like this. Now he just needs to get back on track, ending this marriage, and aborting the child. His original goal of getting his grandmother to have her illness taken care of and for her to live a good old age has been achieved. That\u2019s enough. As for his \u2018fantasy\u2019 emotions, they are worthless.It\u2019s time to end this.However, even if there is no trace of what he and Qu Moyu once had, this child already exists.Shen Dai suddenly pressed his abdomen so hard that he felt pain on it. He didn\u2019t know what he should do. Should he feel it more clearly? Or should he want it to disappear?This is both his and Qu Moyu\u2019s child!Shen Dai felt a lot of pain. His stomach feels very painful. His heart was even more painful. But he couldn\u2019t shed a single tear. And he couldn\u2019t make room to hate anyone. This night was so long. He separated his memories and future, advantages and disadvantages, love and reason. After mashing it up and thinking about it, it should be enough to make the most rational and best decision for himself.He will never follow Shen Qin\u2019s footsteps.Lawyer Chen prepared the next day\u2019s \u2018schedule\u2019 for fear that Shen Dai might hesitate.Early in the morning, he and Qu Moyu were going to get divorced first. And then they will go to the hospital.Lao Wu did not drive the usual black Rolls Royce Phantom. He instead picked them up in a commercial car that Lawyer Chen had already prepared for them.Shen Dai sat next to Qu Moyu and turned his head to look out the window along the way. He pretended to be in a daze, but in fact he was surrounded by Qu Moyu\u2019s ebony pheromones pervasively. He wanted to get rid of this smell but if the two are close, the scent will be stronger and more intoxicating. He was afraid that if he looked back, he might uncontrollably beg Qu Moyu not to abandon himself like this. His purpose is higher than his self-esteem. Otherwise, he would not agree to sell himself in order to pay off his debts. But when he knows that certain purposes cannot be achieved, he will not do any more useless work.Qu Moyu has been peeking at Shen Dai. Shen Dai only left him the back of his head for view and a slender white neck. The pheromone stickers on the back of his neck are hidden under the roots of his hair. If he tears off the stickers, he will be able to see two pale pink teeth marks on his omega. It was the indelible mark he left on his omega glands when he marked him. He was itching to tear off the sticker and take a closer look at the sign that symbolised complete possession.During this time, he was busy dealing with various things. It had been a long time since he had been so close to Shen Dai. Inside the airtight carriage, his nostrils were full of the faint and pleasant fragrance of epiphyllum. The Shen Dai who had been marked by him seemed to be ripe. After marking, the originally shallow pheromone can easily occupy all his senses at this time, and only he can smell it, because this blooming flower is only open for himself.This is his omega, the only person he\u2019s marked in this world. And just thinking about it creates an unspeakable urge\u2014 an urge he\u2019s constantly wary of.The car stopped, and Lawyer Chen broke the silence in the car: \u201cMr. Qu, Mr. Shen, let\u2019s get out of the car. I have already found a good person. As long as you go through the process, it will be done soon.\u201dShen Dai got out of the car in silence and followed behind Lawyer Chen. The three entered a separate office. Lawyer Chen took out two small red books from the briefcase and placed them in front of the staff.Shen Dai\u2019s breathing stagnated and his eyes stopped blankly on the two marriage certificates. It seemed to be the only real thing connecting him and Qu Moyu, but now it\u2019s gone too.When the staff reached out to get the marriage certificate, Shen Dai suddenly grabbed it first, which made everyone stunned.Shen Dai opened the fold of the marriage certificate and looked at the only photo of the two of them. One being restrained and the other being perfunctory. They didn\u2019t look like a loving couple who were about to start a new life, because they weren\u2019t.When it comes to buying and selling, he wants to take it seriously.Qu Moyu also looked at the wedding photo. His chest tightened and he couldn\u2019t explain how uncomfortable it was. He remembered the wedding day. He came and left in a hurry and there was a meeting waiting for him next on that day. He hardly even looked directly at his \u2018wife\u2019. He deliberately kept his distance. Everything that happened later broke his rules again and again. He could call them to stop, but he never stopped until\u2026Shen Dai closed the marriage certificate and put it back intact, without saying a word other than answering the staff\u2019s questions. He was afraid that if he was not careful, he would expose the wounds all over his body.The red book goes in and another red book comes out. The marriage certificate has become a divorce certificate. Qu Moyu is cutting off the connection between them one by one, eager to clear all ties with him.Shen Dai glanced at Qu Moyu, which was the first time he looked directly at him today. Only one glance, with those red eyes.Does it hurt? It doesn\u2019t hurt anymore. It\u2019s just numb.Qu Moyu\u2019s body froze for a moment. He put his hand behind him and held it tightly, his bones rattled slightly.They are back in the car again, the next destination is the hospital.From the roar of the engine ignition, Shen Dai suddenly felt that his heart was suspended. Perhaps until this moment, he really \u2018understood\u2019 one thing. And that was what he was going to do \u2013 he was going to kill his own child.He was so nervous that his heart was beating wildly. Fine sweat was constantly condensing on his forehead and he couldn\u2019t sit still.Through the fusion of pheromones, Qu Moyu immediately noticed Shen Dai\u2019s mood swings. Shen Dai\u2019s sadness and fear seemed to be contagious. He couldn\u2019t hold back and whispered, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dLawyer Chen, who was sitting in the front seat, heard the sound and turned his head around. He gave Qu Moyu a look and then quietly shook his head, indicating that Qu Moyu should ignore Shen Dai at this time to avoid emotional conflict.Shen Dai lowered his head and said nothing. He\u2019s enduring. He\u2019s enduring what he\u2019s carrying at the moment.Seeing that Shen Dai\u2019s face was pale, his thin back was trembling, and that fragile and helpless appearance made Qu Moyu\u2019s face more gloomy. He glanced at Lawyer Chen silently, leaned back in his chair and forced himself not to look at Shen Dai.The car drove to the hospital and Qu Moyu spoke again: \u201cYou two go down first.\u201dLawyer Chen and Lao Wu tacitly opened the door and got out of the car.Qu Moyu lightly tugged at his sleeves, looked down at his watch, and adjusted his emotions. He spoke again and he sounded calm: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to feel wronged. I will prepare ten million trust funds for you. As long as you continue to keep secret and don\u2019t do stupid things, you can withdraw a sum of money every month. If you want, you can continue to work in the institute. The benefits I promised you before will also be given to you in due course, this is already my greatest kindness to you. For the sake of\u2026you being with me these days.\u201dShen Dai twisted his fingers with his fingers and he didn\u2019t let go until it was painful. He trembled slightly and said, \u201cI want to be transferred.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI want to be transferred to Gansu.\u201dShen Dai is by no means a person who acts impulsive, especially for such an important decision as changing cities. This is what he thought about last night. He will not give up the career he loves, but as the teacher said, there are rumours everywhere now. He doesn\u2019t want to work in that kind of environment. He also doesn\u2019t want to work so close to Qu Moyu. A change of places might save him.After hearing what Shen Dai was saying, Qu Moyu suddenly felt a surge of anger going straight to the top of his head. They had just finished the divorce formalities, so Shen Dai wanted to immediately stay away from him?! Could it be that this omega can\u2019t wait to abort their baby and can\u2019t wait to start a new life?Qu Moyu glared at Shen Dai fiercely, and spit out one word: \u201cOkay.\u201dShen Dai opened the car door and got out of the car.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.06.06\u058d\u058d\u058dTranslator\u2019s Note: Reading this chapter again, I understand how Sundae is so much distrustful towards Cuttlefish these days.

He watched Shen Dai disappear from his sight without looking back. Looking up, he saw a sign in red light that was bigger than the size of a person; \u2018HOSPITAL\u2019. He seemed to realise at this moment what Shen Dai was going to do. He suddenly felt a strange and sharp pain in his heart and he grabbed the door handle to resist the urge to chase after him.He repeatedly told himself in his heart that it was the \u2018mark\u2019 that was affecting him. As long as the \u2018mark\u2019 is removed, he will return to his normal self. No one can control his emotions and judgments.Lao Wu glanced at Qu Moyu in the rearview mirror and was taken aback by the pale complexion and sullen eyes. He wanted to ask his boss where he wanted to go next but now he can\u2019t even breathe. He didn\u2019t dare to make a sound.The silence in the car can almost oppress people\u2019s hearts. Lao Wu is extremely fortunate that he is a beta with a low perception of alpha pheromones, but it is already uncomfortable enough.After a long time, Qu Moyu whispered the words: \u201cGo to the company.\u201dSitting in the doctor\u2019s office, Shen Dai expressionlessly listened to the lawyer and the doctor singing double reeds in front of him. Lawyer Chen was explaining to him the necessary terms of the informed consent for the operation and the doctor was routinely informing him of the procedures and risks.\u201cRemoving the \u2018mark\u2019 will require a local anaesthesia operation, which will not cause a lot of burden on the body. You don\u2019t have to worry about it. Your pregnancy time is relatively short, and the abortion method with drugs has the least side effects. After that, you need to stay in the hospital for a few hours for observation. After that, you can go home to recuperate at night.\u201dShen Dai stared blankly at the debonding map of the human body on the wall, but still gave no response.The doctor and Lawyer Chen looked at each other. Lawyer Chen handed a document to Shen Dai: \u201cMr. Shen, please sign it. Your doctor and medical care here are all the best for you. This is a minor operation that doesn\u2019t feel painful. Your body will recover soon.\u201dShen Dai took the consent form and a pen. He stared at the dense text on it. By signing it, it means that he not only knows and agrees to take the risk of surgery, but also means that he voluntarily removes the \u2018mark\u2019.Voluntarily.It is the kind of \u2018voluntary\u2019 that Qu Moyu said \u201cI have a way to make you become \u2018voluntary'\u201d.But now he is really voluntary. Obtaining something that does not belong to him through a bad means will bring endless disasters. The thing he had fantasised about in countless nights, when it really fell on him, it turned into a curse. He didn\u2019t dare to ask for it. He doesn\u2019t want it anymore.If washing off the \u2018mark\u2019 would wake him up from this nightmare, then he is doing it of his own accord.He held the pen and the tip of the pen hovered in the blank space for the signature, only to feel that his fingers were weak and it could not write anything on the paper.Suddenly, pieces of circular water stains continued to surface on the white paper, blurring and smearing the edges of the black ink font, and finally forming a paste, making him unable to see anything clearly.There was a force pulling desperately in his consciousness, screaming and questioning, asking if he really wanted to kill his own child.It wasn\u2019t a child, he argued. It was just an embryo that isn\u2019t even as big as a finger.But it will grow. It will become a living person. It is connected to his bloodline and will continue his life in the form of inheritance. It belongs to him and it will love him unconditionally.It is the only proof in this world that you and Qu Moyu have ever been connected.Lawyer Chen and the doctor watched Shen Dai lowering his head and weeping sadly. They froze aside at a loss.Shen Dai couldn\u2019t see anything clearly. He signed his name tremblingly only through muscle memory. He then threw the pen and paper to cover his face. Tears poured out from between his fingers as he restrained his cry. He only let out a low whimper, even if the heartache seems to be unbearable.He has never cried like this before. This kind of explosive, blowout sadness and pain is the first one in this life. This is not a simple lovelorn but he is standing at the crossroads of fate. There is no smooth road in front of him. He knows that he should choose a thousand-layered giant wave with lower risk and less damage, but still forcibly turned around, facing the naked eye. He has to break free from rational persuasion and embark on a road of no return.At this moment, he didn\u2019t know whether to hate Qu Moyu for being ruthless, or whether he hated himself for not being ruthless. He also didn\u2019t know whether he wanted to keep this child out of love, or was driven by the \u2018mark\u2019 to stimulate the instinct of reproduction.Obviously, he is most unlikely to repeat the mistakes of Shen Qin in his life. And obviously his reason has denied himself from becoming that for ten thousand times. But his strongest thought at this moment was that no one could kill his child.\u201cMr. Shen\u2026\u201d Lawyer Chen took the tissue, \u201cDon\u2019t be too sad.\u201dShen Dai covered his face. His tears still couldn\u2019t stop. But he still spoke in an unusually calm voice: \u201cI will wash off the \u2018mark\u2019. But I want to keep the child.\u201dLawyer Chen and the doctor looked at each other.Lawyer Chen coughed lightly and persuaded with good words: \u201cMr. Shen, you know this is impossible. I understand your feelings very well but your breach of contract must be corrected. I hope you can calm down and look at this clearly.\u201d\u201cI want to keep the child.\u201d Shen Dai rudely wiped away his tears. He raised his head. The fair and clear skin was rubbed with powder marks. There was no plea or self-pity in those wet, red and swollen eyes. There\u2019s only firmness. \u201cYou can neither force me to wash off the \u2018mark\u2019 nor force me to have an abortion. I accept all conditions. I will cooperate with the washing off the \u2018mark\u2019. I don\u2019t want money. I will just keep the child.\u201dThe doctor said helplessly: \u201cMr. Shen, after the surgery to remove the markings, your child cannot be kept.\u201dShen Dai was slightly startled: \u201cThen\u2026 Then ask my husband to allow me to give birth to the child\u2026\u201dLawyer Chen regained his professional indifference: \u201cMr. Shen, it is impossible. You are right. In a society governed by the rules of law, we cannot do anything against your will that damages your health. It is a consensus approach. I believe that neither the process nor the outcome is what you wanted.\u201dShen Dai glared at Lawyer Chen fiercely: \u201cYou are threatening me.\u201dLawyer Chen smiled politely: \u201cI am not \u2018threatening\u2019 you. As a legal practitioner, although I serve my employer, I am also happy to provide you with the simplest and most beneficial solution.\u201d\u201cThat is in your best interest.\u201d\u201cIt is also in the best interest for you.\u201d Lawyer Chen said, \u201cMr. Shen, you are an excellent talent with high knowledge and high salary. You should know when to stop losses in time. And which choices are to seek advantages and avoid disadvantages. Getting divorced, clearing the \u2018mark\u2019, or having a child. Which of these will hinder your happiness for the rest of your life? You are still young, don\u2019t act on your will. Take the money and start a new life without any burden.\u201dShen Dai looked directly into Lawyer Chen\u2019s eyes: \u201cI don\u2019t need you to define how I get happiness.\u201dLawyer Chen narrowed his eyes. He looked at his watch. The movement of him adjusting his breathing showed his impatience while the doctor beside him frowned.Lawyer Chen thought for a while and then said again, \u201cMr. Shen, you\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t be the one who decides.\u201d Shen Dai said coldly, \u201cAsk Qu Moyu to come and talk to me.\u201dLawyer Chen was shocked by Shen Dai\u2019s momentum for a moment and his expression was indescribable.Lawyer Chen made a phone call outside the door for a while. When he came back, his whole face was in a frown. He was obviously trained to follow instructions. He arranged for a car to take Shen Dai back to Qu\u2019s house.Shen Dai was in a daze for a long while and suddenly, he couldn\u2019t believe that he would say those words and make that decision. But after thinking and weighing things over and over again, all the worst consequences that could happen were taken into account. The voice inside him remained firm.This is his child. Before it even comes to its full form, he has already felt love for the child that he is about to give birth.He is different from Shen Qin. He has different motives and is expecting different results.When Qu Moyu came to Shen Dai\u2019s room in anger, just with the approaching of the familiar ebony pheromone made Shen Dai tremble. Qu Moyu is right. There are countless possibilities for him to be \u2018voluntary\u2019. Qu Moyu doesn\u2019t even need to use any other means. Just by using pheromone suppression can make him cry and surrender. He had thought of the consequences. Only by overcoming fear and overcoming the instinct to submit to his own alpha could he be able to protect his child.\u201cWhat do you want to do? You don\u2019t think you have enough money?\u201d Qu Moyu sat on the sofa with his legs crossed, staring at Shen Dai with his dark eyes. An invisible pressure immediately filled the whole room.Shen Dai took a deep breath, tried his best to straighten his spine, and looked directly at Qu Moyu: \u201cFirst, I don\u2019t want your money. Our property has been clearly divided and we don\u2019t owe each other anything. Second, we have divorced. This child is mine. I will only have evidence to ask you for child support if I do a paternity test. I won\u2019t do that. And you won\u2019t need to give me that opportunity. So this child has nothing to do with you. He won\u2019t need a penny from you. Third, I will clear the \u2018mark\u2019 immediately after giving birth. Otherwise, I will not cooperate.\u201dQu Moyu sneered, full of contempt: \u201cDo you think you are smart?\u201dShen Dai tightly pursed his lips.\u201cDo you think you can blackmail me? With the child? With the \u2018mark\u2019?\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s chest was churning with anger. Shen Dai\u2019s words and deeds were verifying everything he was taboo of. He couldn\u2019t tolerate an omega trying to use the \u2018mark\u2019 to manipulate him. That was the biggest challenge of his authority!\u201cI don\u2019t want to \u2018blackmail\u2019 you, but\u2026\u201d Shen Dai subconsciously covered his abdomen with his hands, and said in a trembling voice, \u201cYou can\u2019t kill ou-\u2026 my child.\u201dQu Moyu narrowed his eyes slightly. The words \u2018our child\u2019 made his heart feel suffocated for a while. He stood up and walked towards Shen Dai.Shen Dai raised his head over his shoulders. Every time Qu Moyu took a step closer, he wanted to turn around and run away. He was afraid of this man. From his identity, from his gender, from his physique, and from his genes, he couldn\u2019t find any capital to fight against him. But he did not try to escape.Qu Moyu stood in front of Shen Dai, looking at Shen Dai\u2019s shrinking appearance and pale and haggard face. His heart softened a bit. He toned down his voice: \u201cBe obedient, okay? Don\u2019t do meaningless things.\u201dShen Dai bit his lower lip and used pain to stimulate his will. He looked at Qu Moyu with tears in his eyes: \u201cDid your father persecute your mother like this back then?\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s pupils shrank and he said coldly, \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve to be compared with her. She is my father\u2019s wife and an S-class omega. She married into the Qu family and enjoys a lifetime of glory and wealth. It is her mission to give birth to me.\u201dShen Dai said hoarsely, \u201cDo you know\u2026 how painful is it for her to be forced to kill her own child?\u201d\u201cIt is only necessary for an irreversible act to happen. It is not the cause that has the effect. But it is the effect that determines the cause. She would not have had that child in the first place. Otherwise, there would not have been me.\u201d The most gentle voice said the cruellest words, \u201cAh Dai, I told you already. As long as you are obedient, I will be good to you. I am about to get engaged. This marriage can solve some crises for me. You can\u2019t carry my \u2018mark\u2019. I can\u2019t have an illegitimate child either. Be obedient. Don\u2019t make me embarrassed.\u201dShen Dai stared blankly at Qu Moyu. The more he looked, the stranger he felt. When watching this person from a distance, he always fantasises about how good he is. He used to think that Qu Moyu was the most perfect alpha in the world. A god sent by God to save him. But now those dazzling halos are disappearing in front of him one after another. After they were all gone, he realised that the Qu Moyu he imagined really only existed in his imagination. The real Qu Moyu, wrapped in a beautiful skin, sits on the high platform. He is ruthless, utilitarian, selfish, and heartless. In his eyes, he only has the calculation of profit and loss and the competition for every inch for money. He puts everyone on the chessboard and carefully designs roles and functions for each person. He will decide different ways of using a person according to different situations at different times. It is up to him to decide whether to charge, escort, or give up altogether.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.06.13\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: Just wait. This ruthless asshole will regret it 10,000 times in the future. Shen Dai will no longer want his \u2018mark\u2019 and even his presence or even his love. That fish deserves it!

His laptop\u2019s network was also cut off. It was probably to prevent him from committing any irrational behaviour. Shen Dai couldn\u2019t leave this place and he also couldn\u2019t get in touch with the outside world. He could only spend every minute and every second in pain.Qu Moyu\u2019s words and deeds continued to breed long-lasting hatred in Shen Dai\u2019s repeated reflections. His consciousness alternated between sobriety and confusion. The glands seem to be resisting his reason instinctively, maintaining this physical bond, making him constantly doubt and quibble. How can the person who has saved him from the darkness several times push him further down the abyss?But no matter how many excuses he made, he couldn\u2019t deceive himself. When he stood on the opposite side of his interests, his alpha would use the most ruthless means to deal with him. He was just a piece of chess that could be discarded.Shen Dai forced himself to withdraw from his despair and think about his situation and find a way out. Of course he knew that obeying Qu Moyu might be the only option, at least it wouldn\u2019t be worse than now, but he couldn\u2019t give up on his child. He has had countless conversations with himself these days. He tried to use reason, optimism, and all the practical factors such as pros and cons to convince himself to make the most self-interested and least damaging choice. But all of them failed. His inner voice was so firm and stubborn that he could not even tell whether it was his true thoughts or whether it was the effect of the \u2018mark\u2019 on his mind. He only knows that he must protect his child.So the only question now is how to do it.There are several servants in the Qu family, and there are bodyguards who are eyeing him. He has no way to communicate with the outside world, and he can\u2019t even leave the place.In the evening, Aunt Lan came to the room to deliver his meals.Shen Dai sat on the sofa hugging his knees, looking at Aunt Lan blankly. His eyes dimmed.Aunt Lan glanced at the untouched lunch on the table and sighed, \u201cAh Dai, eat something.\u201dShen Dai nodded and then shook his head. It was as if he didn\u2019t hear anything.Aunt Lan advised: \u201cIf you are hungry, the baby in your belly will also be hungry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only been three weeks. It doesn\u2019t have the physiological function of \u2018starvation\u2019 yet.\u201d Shen Dai said calmly, \u201canyway, it will be killed soon.\u201dAunt Lan looked at him hesitantly. She opened her mouth and seemed to hesitate to say something. She finally sighed heavily.Shen Dai\u2019s psychological pressure was already overloaded. He knew that no one could help him. It could be seen that Aunt Lan didn\u2019t go out, so he couldn\u2019t help but ask in a low voice, \u201cAunt Lan, I really want to give birth to it. Is this normal?\u201d He questioned his choice all the time but still ended up making a firm choice every time. This deep contradiction tore his heart repeatedly. His whole person seemed about to collapse at any time.\u201cIt\u2019s normal. It\u2019s your instinct.\u201d Aunt Lan looked at Shen Dai\u2019s dejected appearance and couldn\u2019t help but think of the first time the two met. This handsome and gentle young man with poetry and books in his belly made her feel good. How did it become like this now? She couldn\u2019t bear it so she said, \u201cBut, you are still young. This child will drag you down for the rest of your life.\u201dShen Dai smiled bitterly and murmured, \u201cI know.\u201d He looked up at Aunt Lan, \u201cAunt Lan, can you let me escape?\u201d When he said this, he didn\u2019t have any hope. It\u2019s just a tiny struggle in a desperate situation.Aunt Lan\u2019s eyes turned red: \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t help you.\u201dShen Dai nodded and returned to silence. He thought that he could only find a chance when he went to the hospital. His only thought now was to stay away from Qu Moyu and from the people who would hurt him and his child.Shen Dai didn\u2019t know when he finally fell asleep. He was awakened by a noise. He rubbed his eyes and just sat up from the bed when the door was roughly pushed open by someone.Shen Dai looked at this aggressive woman in surprise. It was Mrs. Qu. The first two times he saw her, she was extravagant and elegant. She was too beautifully crafted, like a display window that displayed expensive jewellery. Like a model where not even a single strand of hair is allowed to go wrong. But now she suddenly became vivid in front of him.A group of people followed behind her, including Uncle Heng who was in a dilemma and the bodyguards of Qu Moyu who looked anxious.Shen Dai\u2019s drowsiness had been thrown away immediately. However, the chaos in front of him made him even more confused.Mrs. Qu glanced at Shen Dai and said to Aunt Lan beside her, \u201cI give you fifteen minutes. Help him pack his luggage.\u201dAunt Lan walked to the closet with familiarity, took out the suitcase inside, and started folding the clothes.Uncle Heng said urgently, \u201cMadam\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up. Whoever of you dares to stop me will pack up and quit.\u201d Mrs. Qu said bluntly, but from the look on her face, she also looked a little nervous.Shen Dai reacted vigorously. He jumped out of bed and began to pack his important belongings.No matter where, he is willing to go as long as he can get out of here.Shen Dai didn\u2019t have many things. Many of his items were those prepared when he came. He always knew that he was only staying there temporarily. In fact, except for the computer, he could bring nothing else with him. So he packed up pretty quickly.Aunt Lan took advantage of the closet door to quietly say to Shen Dai, \u201cAh Dai, don\u2019t blame the young master. He has to learn everything by himself. No one has taught him to love. Take care of yourself in the future.\u201dShen Dai was sore in his heart. He choked and said, \u201cAunt Lan, thank you.\u201d He knew that it was Aunt Lan who notified Mrs. Qu. Aunt Lan was originally brought over by Mrs. Qu from her parents\u2019 house. She had no reason to help him. At the risk of being reprimanded by Qu Mo, she still helped, and the only reason for this was her sheer kindness.Shen Dai took the luggage and got into Mrs. Qu\u2019s car. It was not until the car drove out of the gate of Qu\u2019s house that Shen Dai\u2019s tight airway quietly opened. He took a deep breath even though his heart was still nervous.Mrs. Qu glanced at Shen Dai: \u201cYou have to thank Ah Lan. She is prepared to be released.\u201dShen Dai said hoarsely, \u201cI am very grateful to Aunt Lan and I am also grateful to you.\u201d\u201cDo you know why I took you away?\u201d\u201c\u2026He told me that before him, you were forced to abort a beta daughter.\u201dMrs. Qu was a little surprised: \u201cHe told you this?\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dMrs. Qu was silent for a moment: \u201cPerhaps you do have weight in his heart.\u201dShen Dai didn\u2019t know how to comprehend this sentence. But still he couldn\u2019t accuse the son in front of his mother.\u201cI have always regretted that I was too weak at the time. If I had given birth to her desperately at that time, I would not have felt guilty for the rest of my life. And I would not have\u2026\u201d Mrs. Qu\u2019s face was expressionless. It seemed to be filled with the grief from the past. The years have solidified and the old scars have become mottled by the wind and frost, \u201cWould not have been able to love my son properly.\u201dShen Dai said solemnly: \u201cI understand what you said to me before. I don\u2019t belong to the same world as him, and I can\u2019t fit into such a world.\u201d\u201cSo what\u2019s your plan?\u201d\u201cI want to find a place to settle down. After giving birth to the child, I will immediately wash off the mark.\u201d Shen Dai thought of something and immediately explained, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will never use this child to blackmail the Qu family. I have saved some money. And I\u2019m able to support myself.\u201d He certainly won\u2019t be able to keep his job in Xingzhou, but with his resume, he will definitely be able to find a well-paid job in the industry. Despite this, he will lose some of his past accumulation, and more importantly, he will be sorry for the teacher\u2019s cultivation of him. But there is no other way at the moment.\u201cI believe in you. And this is not my concern.\u201d Mrs. Qu glanced at Shen Dai, her eyes softened. \u201cI did this just to make up for the regret in my heart. Not to mention, this child is my grandson or granddaughter.\u201dShen Dai said gratefully, \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cHowever, there is one thing I want to remind you. So that you have a mental preparation in advance. You should have some relevant common sense. Omega needs alpha pheromone in the process of giving birth to a child and the lack of alpha pheromone can easily cause the foetus to be underdeveloped. It might end up with congenital diseases and even become disabled in severe cases.\u201d\u201cI know this. But isn\u2019t there a substitute alpha pheromone that can help?\u201d\u201cYes, but you are carrying an S-level alpha child. Now, whether it is a genetically modified universal pheromone or a synthetic pheromone, it may not be able to replace the role of a strong pheromone as an S-level alpha in the process of breeding offspring. Specifically, you need to consult a doctor.\u201d Mrs. Qu frowned slightly, \u201cThis is actually the problem that needs to be solved the most right now. If modern medicine can\u2019t solve it, nothing can help you.\u201dShen Dai was stunned for a long time. He didn\u2019t expect that when he had already decided to give birth to this child, there would be such a fatal problem in front of him. If there was no pheromone that could replace Qu Moyu\u2019s pheromone during his pregnancy, he would simply can\u2019t keep this child. All his persistence will be meaningless.\u201cI\u2019ve made an appointment with a doctor for you. We\u2019ll go see him now.\u201d Mrs. Qu sighed, \u201cYou have to be mentally prepared.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s mind was blank and he didn\u2019t come back to his senses until Mrs. Qu\u2019s phone rang.Mrs. Qu glanced at the screen, hung her finger for a moment, and slid to the call key: \u201cHello.\u201dIn the carriage, Qu Moyu\u2019s suppressed anger can be heard slightly to Shen Dai\u2019s ears. He could only hear fragments of words, but he could also piece together the general meaning.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me these words, it\u2019s useless.\u201d\u201cThe company\u2019s business is your business.\u201d\u201cVengeance? Not really. I think I\u2019m accumulating virtue for the Qu family.\u201dMrs. Qu\u2019s tone was always steady. She hung up the phone and saw Shen Dai looking at her in panic. She shook her head gently: \u201cI thought he didn\u2019t have time to deal with this today.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s his engagement banquet tonight.\u201d Mrs. Qu looked at her watch, \u201cI have to rush over there later.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s breathing was stagnant. The pale blood on his face faded instantly. His heart was aching. He had to get used to coexisting with such pain, because he knew very well that maternal instinct made him temporarily close the valve of his feelings. He waited until he had the energy to think back to Qu Moyu. All kinds of things have happened in between them. Those desperate wounds will keep dragging him to the dark abyss. In every sleepless night, every morning when he wakes up with obsession, every moment when the memories suddenly counterattack\u2026 He does not know how long it will take for him to piece together his torn self.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.06.15\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: Ugh.

But he was still embarrassed. Because of his situation, he could only hide his emotions and describe the situation to the doctor.After listening, the doctor nodded: \u201cYou are divorced. Your ex-husband\u2019s pheromone level is S. You want to give birth to this child and then wash off the mark.\u201dShen Dai wanted to explain the cause and effect of his relationship that the doctor expressed in these few sentences, but he felt that it was unnecessary, so he just nodded.\u201cIn this case, the best way is to get your ex-husband to cooperate and extract a little pheromone from his glands to help you get through the pregnancy. After giving birth, you can wash off the mark.\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t agree with me giving birth to the child, so he won\u2019t help me.\u201dThe doctor raised his eyebrows: \u201cThen why did you agree to divorce? He can\u2019t divorce you during your pregnancy. As long as you don\u2019t divorce, as long as you want to have a baby, he must cooperate with you.\u201dShen Dai lowered his eyes. The situation behind this was complicated. How can he explain to a stranger: \u201cDoctor, is there any other way? Can I use a universal substitute pheromone or synthetic pheromone?\u201d\u201cTheoretically, you can. I have been a reproductive doctor all my life, helping many omegas use alternative pheromones to assist or treat various diseases. But the pheromone of S-level alpha is too strong. It is extremely difficult to be replaced. I have never treated this problem before so in this case, the probability is too low. And it is difficult to find examples of success or failure. The foetus is still small and the need for alpha pheromone is not that obvious yet. The bigger it is, the greater the impact of alpha pheromone on it. Judging by experience, the success rate is very low.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s face was gloomy. His lips trembled slightly and he lowered his head helplessly.The doctor looked at Shen Dai with some sympathy, \u201cWhether this child will be born or not, you must think of whether it will be healthy or not. And also think of your safety during delivery. I can\u2019t give you any guarantee. If your alpha can\u2019t help you, you just drop it.\u201dAfter a long silence, Shen Dai endured the pain in his heart and asked, \u201cIs there any other way?\u201d\u201cAh, there is almost no other way. If you are not marked, it\u2019s fine. If you are marked, the alpha pheromone will fuse with you and the foetus in your womb deeply. So a substitute pheromone can\u2019t be used.\u201dShen Dai was so uncomfortable that he didn\u2019t know what to do. He wanted to hide his hand in the pocket of his lab coat. But after a long time of groping, he realised that he hadn\u2019t worn the lab coat for a long time. He has made all the preparations. He is prepared for what to give up for this child. There is no consideration of whether it is worth it or not. There is only the consciousness of willingness or not. But in the end, he can\u2019t keep it after all. He tossed and turned in several nights, peeling off the bloody armed forces of twenty-eight years of experience and cognition layer after layer, exposing the truest self, with the tragic and solemn sacrifice, and finally making up the determination. But now it seems that it is all just a joke.However, he has imagined meeting this child countless times in the future. And he has already felt that a tender seed is quietly germinating in his body. He has begun to expect that he will have a person who loves him wholeheartedly and unconditionally. But it is too late to meet the person. It is only farewell before even meeting each other.It was not until the moment when he was sure that he would lose it that Shen Dai understood why he was so persistent and even got a little crazy wanting to give birth to this child. It was because he wanted to have a family. He didn\u2019t have parents in the real sense. His grandma couldn\u2019t be with him anymore after a few years. The heart he put on Qu Moyu was crushed to the ground. In the near future, when grandma is gone, he will have no family members left. Without his family, he would have no place to call home. Just thinking about it, he would be engulfed by the boundless loneliness.His heart is full of despair and helplessness. Perhaps this is his destiny.Seeing Shen Dai\u2019s soulless appearance, the doctor comforted him: \u201cKid, you are still young. You will have a new life and you will find an alpha who can breed offspring with you. Let\u2019s just move forward.\u201dShen Dai quickly wiped away the dripping tears and said in a hoarse voice, \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cNo need to thank me. I couldn\u2019t even help you.\u201d\u201cCan you help me arrange the surgery as soon as possible to wash off the mark?\u201d Shen Dai tried desperately to restrain himself but his vocal cords kept shaking, \u201cIt\u2019s better today. It\u2019s better if it is now.\u201dHe will \u2018return\u2019 the \u2018mark\u2019 to Qu Moyu as an engagement gift for him.\u201cIt\u2019s too hasty.\u201d The doctor looked at his watch. \u201cA series of examinations needed to be done. I see your current mental state and I think you are not suitable for surgery. Let\u2019s take a good rest for a few days before making any arrangements.\u201d\u201cMy body is healthy and there is no problem.\u201d Shen Dai stubbornly stared into the doctor\u2019s eyes, \u201cI want to wash off the marks immediately.\u201d The smell of ebony wood that once made him fascinated now made him feel disgusted to even think about for a second. When he smelled it around him, he wanted to get rid of this \u2018mark\u2019 immediately. He wanted to get rid of the \u2018mark\u2019 that Qu Moyu left on his body and soul. He wanted to never have anything to do with the person who forced him to kill his own child.The doctor was embarrassed and looked at his watch again: \u201cThis time is really too hasty.\u201d He picked up the phone on the table, \u201cXiao Zhao, come to my office.\u201dAfter a while, a nurse knocked on the door and came in. Mrs. Qu, who was waiting at the door, followed and asked Shen Dai through her eyes.Shen Dai looked at her blankly with a dead silence in his eye as a reply.Madam Qu\u2019s expression quickly dimmed.The doctor and nurse were discussing whether the operation could be timed out, and at the same time, they also respectfully asked Mrs. Qu for her opinion.\u201cAre you going to have an operation today?\u201d Mrs. Qu gave Shen Dai a worried look, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be in such a hurry. I\u2019ll settle you first. It\u2019s too hasty today.\u201dShen Dai shook his head stiffly: \u201cPlease. I want to wash off the mark right away.\u201d This nightmarish alpha pheromone, while releasing physiological dependence and sweet memories, shows ruthless words and deeds and cruel disgust. The cold breath of sandalwood no longer gave him joy and fantasy. But instead, it was like the thorny vines entangling him, constantly twisting, around him again and again, draining his blood, taking his breath, giving him endless pain and fear.He just wanted to get away.Mrs. Qu looked at Shen Dai silently for a while, and then asked the doctor, \u201cCan we arrange it today?\u201dThe doctor said helplessly: \u201cWe don\u2019t recommend being so hasty seeing that Mr. Shen\u2019s physical condition is not very good. But if Mr. Shen strongly requests, we can work overtime.\u201d He confirmed to Shen Dai again, \u201cMr. Shen, washing off the marks and abortion needs to be done together. Are you ready?\u201dShen Dai stared blankly at the doctor. Is he going to kill this kid together? Today? Now?Is he ready?\u201cDo you have to\u2026 do it together?\u201d Shen Dai murmured.The nurse said softly, \u201cThese two items are recommended to be done together. After using anaesthesia, the foetus will not be able to survive. Although washing off the \u2018mark\u2019 is a minimal invasive operation, the impact of abortion on the body is relatively large. I\u2019m afraid your body can\u2019t take it all at once.\u201dShen Dai lowered his head slightly and stared at his abdomen motionlessly. He has never been more helpless than this moment. And he has never made a more difficult decision than this.\u201cMr. Shen, you can think about it again. For the sake of your body.\u201dIn Shen Dai\u2019s chaotic brain, an incandescent electric light suddenly flashed. It was like a praying meteor he desperately wanted to \u2018catch\u2019. He suddenly raised his head and stared at the nurse: \u201cI can just wash off the \u2018mark\u2019?\u201dThe nurse was startled by his bright pupils: \u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIf I wash off the \u2018mark\u2019, can this child use a substitute pheromone?\u201d Shen Dai turned to look at the doctor, as if a drowning man had grabbed on a life-saving straw.The doctor was also at a loss: \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dMrs. Qu also looked at Shen Dai quizzically. She began to worry about Shen Dai\u2019s mental state.\u201cIt\u2019s only three weeks old and hasn\u2019t grown yet. The alpha pheromone doesn\u2019t have much effect on him, right?\u201d Shen Dai stood up excitedly, \u201cIf I wash off the \u2018mark\u2019 now, without this mark, it can use substitute pheromones, right?!\u201dThe nurse looked at Shen Dai with some sympathy: \u201cMr. Shen, you may not have heard clearly. You need anaesthesia for the operation. The anaesthesia will cause damage to the foetus\u2026\u201d\u201cNo anaesthetic then.\u201dThe three people in the room looked at Shen Dai in shock.Shen Dai\u2019s face was pale and sluggish, with only a pair of eyes looking sober and firm.The old doctor took off his glasses and wiped the sweat from his forehead, as if he couldn\u2019t believe what he had heard.\u201cDoctor, you just said that as long as there is no such \u2018mark\u2019, I can use alternative pheromones to assist fertility.\u201d Shen Dai clenched his fists tightly, his nails digging deep into the flesh, he traded pain for incomparable sobriety, \u201d Before it takes shape and doesn\u2019t have much dependence on alpha pheromones, help me wash off the \u2018mark\u2019 now. And I can\u2026 do it without anaesthesia.\u201dThe nurse took a deep breath: \u201cThis\u2026 Mr. Shen, this is crazy. Although washing off the \u2018mark\u2019 is only a minimal invasive surgery, it is a local anaesthetic operation. It is still a surgery after all. And that kind of pain is not something ordinary people can bear.\u201dShen Dai said word by word: \u201cI\u2019m not an ordinary person.\u201dMrs. Qu came back to her senses and pulled Shen Dai aside: \u201cAh Dai, are you crazy? You won\u2019t take anaesthesia?! You\u2026 you don\u2019t have to do this. Although Mo Yu is my son, \u2026no one deserves this. \u201c\u201cMy child deserves this.\u201d Shen Dai held Mrs. Qu\u2019s hand gently and smiled, \u201cI\u2019m not doing this for him. Maybe this sentence is not firm enough now, but when I wash off the \u2018mark\u2019, when we are no longer related, by then, my child is just my child. I am doing this for myself.\u201dMrs. Qu looked at Shen Dai fixedly. Her tears suddenly fell. She held Shen Dai\u2019s hand tightly and said with a smile as if crying, \u201cIf I were half as brave as you, I wouldn\u2019t be in pain for a lifetime. Go on. Don\u2019t let yourself regret it like me.\u201d\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.06.16\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: Honest to God, I cried when I read this chapter for the first time.

He was busy fulfilling the obligations of a host\u2019s hospitality. He was holding a wine glass in his right hand and his fianc\u00e9e in the crook of his left arm. This was the first time they met. He should have been gentle and considerate, to gain a little understanding, and to lay a good foundation for a harmonious married life in the future. He was absent-minded. Whenever he had free time, he quickly checked his mobile phone. He was waiting for his people to find out the whereabouts of his mother and Shen Dai.Today is his engagement day. From negotiating the marriage, publishing the invitations, and preparing the engagement banquet, it was hastily completed in one week. He was so busy all day that he couldn\u2019t get out. Thinking that his mother would cause him trouble at this time, he could only deal with it in a low-key manner and talk about it with her when he had time tomorrow.\u201cBrother Yu, do you have something to deal with? Let me take care of the people here for a while.\u201d The person beside him gave him a decent smile.His fiancee\u2019s name is Zhou Xiaochu. His grandfather is a banker with a prominent family background. He is an S-class omega, with extraordinary appearance, a superior background, studied art in a famous school, and has a gentle and low-key personality. Like many omegas from powerful families, he was raised as the wife candidate of an S-class alpha since he was a child. This marriage will benefit the business, cultivation, and taste impeccably.This is the wife candidate that satisfies Qu Moyu. He knew at a very young age what kind of omega he would marry in the future. And if he could enter the screening framework, he didn\u2019t need the condition of \u2018liking\u2019 someone at all. The most important was that the person was \u2018not disgusting\u2019. And that is enough. Everything can be clearly priced. Only \u2018liking\u2019 someone is a trick with inflated valuations.Shen Dai\u2019s face appeared in front of him again. Qu Moyu couldn\u2019t help being anxious. Ever since he knew that Shen Dai was taken away, it have been difficult to calm down his emotions. He glanced at the phone again, and then smiled politely at Zhou Xiaochu: \u201cThere is indeed something to do. I\u2019ll ask you to take care of things here. I\u2019ll go and make a call.\u201dQu Moyu walked to the terrace and called Lao Wu.\u201cHey, Mr. Qu.\u201d Lao Wu sighed when he opened his mouth, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I haven\u2019t found them yet. Madam must have expected that we would send someone to look for them. She used a different car and hired unknown people to ensure that we will not find them. \u201c\u201cKeep looking. There\u2019s no need to let my dad know about this kind of thing.\u201d Qu Moyu said with a sullen face.\u201cYes.\u201dAfter hanging up the phone, Qu Moyu kicked the flower bed in anger. He took a few deep breaths to control the surging pheromones in his body.His father has warned him to deal with Shen Dai\u2019s matter as soon as possible. If this matter is known, he would be scolded. He can\u2019t stand that he can\u2019t control his omega. It\u2019s too embarrassing. He didn\u2019t need to investigate the whole thing. He could already guess that Aunt Lan had tipped his mother about it. The nanny who brought him up since he was a child and his biological mother actually joined forces to deal with him. As well as Shen Dai, who disobeyed again and again. This caused him to burn with anger.Why can\u2019t Shen Dai be like other omegas? He couldn\u2019t tell for a while whether Shen Dai wanted too little or too much.Qu Moyu adjusted his expression and returned to the splendid banquet hall again. He was surprised to find that his mother was standing beside his father without looking abnormal.Qu Moyu strode over. In front of Qu Shen, he couldn\u2019t ask questions directly. He just frowned at Mrs. Qu.Mrs. Qu looked at him like nothing was wrong: \u201cWhere\u2019s your fianc\u00e9e? Bring me to meet him .\u201dZhou Xiaochu just happened to come over and greeted his future parents-in-law generously. Mrs. Qu chatted with him with a kind smile. Qu Shen whispered to his son about business affairs. Qu Moyu couldn\u2019t find a chance to be alone for a while to question his mother.Seeing that all the guests had arrived, a simple engagement ceremony was held together under the co-presidency of Qu Shen and the Zhou\u2019s elders. The biggest significance of this evening is the overwhelming press release tomorrow and the stock price that will definitely rise. Obviously it\u2019s a business cooperation and most of the people present today are only here for the value that they could get. But everyone\u2019s words must still be pretentious with love, wishing them a \u2018happy marriage\u2019.There was a fake smile on Qu Moyu\u2019s face. Under this perfectly shining body, he was constantly suppressing and adjusting his state. What the hell happened tonight? He was flustered. His emotions fluctuate greatly. Shen Dai\u2019s face kept appearing in front of him, and all kinds of expressions of his in his mind made him have a bad premonition. Of the storms he has been through in his life, none of them alone could cause him more anxiety than Shen Dai. It can\u2019t even be called a major crisis. How could he be so anxious? It doesn\u2019t make sense.His face began to sweat and he couldn\u2019t sit still. Even Qu Shen noticed something was wrong with him, and said in a low voice, \u201cYou drink less.\u201dThis is not because of alcohol. He doesn\u2019t know what happened to his body. The fluctuation of pheromones is getting bigger and bigger. He must pay attention to control himself to prevent the release of pheromones at an untimely moment. He has a kind of a very unfamiliar perception at the moment. An indistinguishable and difficult to define moment. It made him anxious, fearful, flustered, and uncomfortable. He determined that this perception was related to Shen Dai.His body swayed and if he hadn\u2019t grabbed the armrest of the chair back in time, he might have made a fool of himself on the spot.\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d\u201cHaha! Drinking too much? Too happy.\u201d\u201cOh, your face is pale. Drink less. Don\u2019t you feel uncomfortable?\u201dQu Moyu put down the glass and smiled dryly: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll go to the bathroom.\u201dZhou Xiaochu asked gently, \u201cDo you want me to accompany you?\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Qu Moyu walked to the bathroom without looking back.When he saw his pale face in the mirror, he was stunned for more than ten seconds. The S-class alpha\u2019s physical fitness is far beyond ordinary people. He rarely gets sick. If nothing happens and his body is obviously well, it is mostly related to pheromone fluctuations. His pheromone will not have such big fluctuations for no reason. This situation has never happened before him \u2018marking\u2019 Shen Dai. But it has been frequently influenced by Shen Dai since then. So what happened to him now? Or in other words, what happened to Shen Dai? !There will be nothing wrong with Shen Dai\u2026 No, Shen Dai is leaving with his mother. What is the difficulty of settling down as an adult who can take care of himself?But why is he so restless? An inexplicable emotion constantly intrudes on his mind and judgement. He doesn\u2019t care about other things at all. At this moment, the strongest thought is to find Shen Dai and confirm Shen Dai safety immediately.He looked at his watch and saw that the engagement banquet was far from over. It was not impossible for him to leave on the grounds of his health. Although it would certainly lead to dissatisfaction from his father and the Zhou family, who would dare to talk too much? What really worried him was that he had the idea of leaving early to find Shen Dai during his engagement banquet. So impulsive, emotional, and ignorant. This should not be something he would have thought and much less something he would have done.Is he crazy?After staying in the bathroom for ten minutes and washing his face with cold water several times, Qu Moyu found that he still couldn\u2019t resolve the anxiety. He pressed his heart with his hand, wrinkling the expensive custom suit. The pheromones went rampage in his body. Now as long as one is not careful, he just needs a little stimulation and he may hurt people. In this state, he couldn\u2019t go back to the banquet at all. He turned on his mobile phone and called his mother.\u201cMother, I\u2019m not feeling well. Come to the bathroom alone.\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s hoarse voice did not seem to be fake and Mrs. Qu was also worried. She quickly rushed to the bathroom and locked the door.The high-grade fragrance in the bathroom mixed with the smell of ebony pheromone can force any omega who steps in here to get out. But there is a type of people in this world who have a very high resistance to the pheromone of an S-class alpha. That is their mother.Mrs. Qu saw that Qu Moyu\u2019s face had lost all colour so she ran over to support him in fright: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? What\u2019s wrong?\u201dQu Moyu grabbed Mrs. Qu\u2019s wrist, stared into her eyes and said solemnly, \u201cWhere is Shen Dai?\u201dMadam Qu frowned.\u201cMom!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to care where he is. It doesn\u2019t matter. Today is your engagement day. Take care of your future wife.\u201d\u201cShen Dai is my omega. Why did you take him away? What\u2019s your qualification to do so? How can you do such an irrational thing? Do you know\u2026\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not your omega anymore.\u201d Mrs. Qu looked into Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes and said calmly.Qu Moyu was stunned: \u201c\u2026what do you mean?\u201d\u201cI told you to leave him alone. I\u2019ve already handled it for you.\u201d Mrs. Qu\u2019s expression was tense. Her emotions were unreadable. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have an operation right now to wash off the \u2018mark\u2019 and knock out the child.\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s body felt like it was casted in a body-fixing spell. He stared blankly at the bright marble floor.The problem was solved. Shen Dai followed his orders. Hewashed off the mark, knocked out the child, and he didn\u2019t even need to face Shen Dai\u2019s emotional pressure. His mother had solved it for him.Isn\u2019t this exactly what he wanted? But why does his heart chamber hurt like it\u2019s about to burst? It\u2019s a real pain that is concretized and about to cause convulsions. It made him feel the fear of suffocation in the next minute.Is it because of the \u2018mark\u2019. It is because the pheromone that he and Shen Dai originally merged with was cut off. So his body would have such a big reaction. It must be that. Otherwise, he cannot explain the source of this dark anxiety.Shen Dai is no longer his omega. He is no longer Shen Dai\u2019s alpha.Even the little life they bred together was gone. It was as if the line that connected the two of them broke in an instant.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.06.17\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: I think QMY felt that way because SD is going through surgery without anaesthesia.

He took a breath and eased his heart palpitations. He asked in a low voice, \u201cWhich hospital?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cMom, which hospital is he in?\u201d This is the first time Qu Moyu has used such a tone to show his softness to someone since he was an adult, even if it is towards his mother.\u201cWhat are you doing? It\u2019s just a minor surgery. He will be fine. I have arranged the follow-up. He will be compensated and you don\u2019t need to worry about it anymore.\u201dQu Moyu gritted his teeth and suppressed his anger: \u201cEven if there is no \u2018mark\u2019, he is still my omega. This is a matter between us. You should not bother.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m doing it for your own good. You\u2019re already engaged to Xiaochu. And it\u2019s unclear how you can explain it to the Zhou family.\u201d Mrs. Qu said indifferently, \u201cBesides, do you think he wants to see you now?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cFor such an important engagement banquet, it seems too insincere to leave as soon as you\u2019re done with it. This marriage with the Zhou family is to solve the company\u2019s financial problems. Which one is more important? Do you still need me to teach you?\u201d Mrs. Qu asked obliquely. Looking at his son, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to get emotional, right?\u201dQu Moyu was so choked that he could not speak. Mrs. Qu is right. He should be glad that someone solved Shen Dai\u2019s trouble for him when he was incapacitated so that the marriage could go on smoothly. The place he needs to go now is the banquet hall and what he needs to do is to maintain the relationship with Zhou\u2019s in-laws. He should not go to Shen Dai in an impulsive manner.It\u2019s not like me at all. And it\u2019s not something stupid that I would do, Qu Moyu said to himself.It must be because he has just cleared the \u2018mark\u2019 His body and mind have not fully adapted. He cares about Shen Dai. But he knows what is \u2018more important\u2019.Qu Moyu slowly lowered his head, the corners of his lips twitched. He was holding back something: \u201cDid you arrange someone to take care of him?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cWhich hospital is he in? Give him back to me. Tomorrow\u2026\u201d\u201cHe won\u2019t want to see you. So it\u2019s time for you to correct your position.\u201d Mrs. Qu\u2019s tone became stern, \u201cYou were not from the same world. And now you have nothing to do with him. What else do you want to do with him? Play your role well and implement your own choices. Isn\u2019t this the philosophy of the Qu family?\u201dQu Moyu also raised his voice: \u201cThis is about me and him. Can you not interfere!\u201d\u201cDo you dare to let your father know?\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s face was gloomy.Mrs. Qu turned to face the mirror in the bathroom, smoothed her hair, and adjusted the priceless jade necklace on her fair neck. It was as if she said the next words to Qu Moyu and also herself, \u201cGo back. It\u2019s your own choice.\u201dShen Dai was sitting in a chair in the waiting area of the hospital. He was waiting for the car. Waiting for the car arranged for him by Mrs. Qu. This car will send him directly from the capital to Lancheng in the span of more than 1,000 kilometres.He originally wanted to go by himself, but Mrs. Qu told him not to take public transportation. This is because Qu Moyu could easily find his whereabouts if he does. He actually didn\u2019t think that Qu Moyu would come to look for him. There was no need for that. But after learning that Mrs. Qu couldn\u2019t come to see him because he was afraid of being followed by Qu Moyu, he wanted to be cautious just for the safety of the child.He has been really busy these days.The three days after the operation was a nightmarish experience. He was tied to the operating table and endured excruciating pain. Although the wound was not big, the damage to the glands caused his internal circulation to become unbalanced. Due to the stress caused by the pain, he couldn\u2019t fall asleep normally. He also did not dare to move his body. He was always dizzy and nauseated. He vomited everything he ate and was always worried that he would have a miscarriage. The doctor had informed him about this risk before the operation. If he suffered such a crime and the child was still not saved, it could only be said that it wasn\u2019t meant to be. Fortunately, under the doctor\u2019s careful care, his body gradually recovered.But the wound on the soul will never heal. When he woke up, he could no longer feel the ebony pheromones that had been deposited in his body, nor could he feel Qu Moyu. It was as if the tightly entwined vines that provided nutrients to each other were brutally stripped and the sharp barbs scraped them down to pieces of flesh and blood. It was something that had been dug away in his life, leaving behind a huge void of belief. It was far deeper and more painful than the scar on the back of the neck gland.In those three days, more than the physical and mental pain, what afflicted him was the endless loneliness. Also, the sadness of facing the pain alone and not even having an acquaintance to pour him a cup of hot water. Under such despair, he had more expectations and reliance on the unformed foetus in his womb. Maybe it was God\u2019s mercy. Maybe it was because of belief, it was unfortunate that the child was still in his body after all this tossing. The child has such good luck.He strengthened his love and responsibility for this child even more. Looking at his life, he thought that it was not this child who needed him But it was he who needed this child.After his body recovered, he began to deal with the family and business affairs.He declined Madam Qu\u2019s sponsorship, but accepted her help for other things. He still had hundreds of thousands of cash in his hand. Mrs. Qu helped him transfer the money to a trusted account, so that others could not track him through consumption.He bought a new mobile phone and made a long phone call to his grandmother, explaining that he was in some trouble and needed to be transferred for a year. He thought his grandmother would have a lot of questions, but grandmother seemed to sense his cover-up and embarrassment. So she thoughtfully didn\u2019t ask too much. Although her voice was choked, she just told him to take good care of himself and not worry about her. He couldn\u2019t let go of his grandmother, but he had to settle down first before he could consider taking her over. However, the medical conditions in Lancheng are much worse than those in Beijing. Perhaps it is best for his grandmother to stay here. Shen Qin is rich now. Naturally, he will not neglect his mother. This matter can only be discussed after he has stabilised in Lancheng.He sent a group email to his colleagues, explaining that he needed a period of recuperation due to illness. He had few close friends and the social relationships that needed to be maintained were basically these colleagues and friends in the academic circle only.He called the teacher and Cheng Zimei again and told them the truth. He can\u2019t go back to resign now. Anyway, Qu Moyu asked him to take a long-term sick leave. So he will just do it for the time being. He is not suitable for work now. It\u2019s better to finish writing the thesis during this period.Liu Xi sighed for a long time and finally let him go to Gansu, where the mining area also belongs to Xingzhou. The person in charge of the research institute is his fellow senior brother, who not only can help him in personal life, but also support him with materials, equipment, and data collection for his thesis. It is now the best place to go.Shen Dai was very grateful to the teacher and felt extremely guilty. The teacher had trained him for nearly ten years. He treated him like someone who would take over his positions someday, but he just walked away. Even he couldn\u2019t forgive himself. He didn\u2019t know how to pull the timeline. It has grown to the length of a lifetime, whether the choice at this moment is right or wrong for him, worth it or not, from the moment he made the choice, he can no longer turn back. He must go on with it tenaciously.Liu Xi did not reproach him. He instead comforted him: \u201cYou are still young. It is normal for you to have several ups and downs in your academic career. As long as you don\u2019t give up, you will have the opportunity to achieve results at any time in the future. \u201cShen Dai\u2019s tears fell when he heard it: \u201cTeacher, I swear I will not give up. I will go to Lancheng to help Senior Brother Bai to do some work. In the future, as long as I can do it, you can use me as you like.\u201d\u201cGo ahead. You have always been very clear about what you want. And you have plans and implementations. I believe that you can control your own life.\u201dWhen the car arranged by Mrs. Qu arrived, Shen Dai took his luggage and walked out of the hospital.After getting in the car, Shen Dai closed his eyes and adjusted his breath for a moment before he mustered the courage to open his mobile phone and searched for a press release about the engagement of the heir of Xingzhou Group.The two people in the photo are well-matched. At first glance, it is a perfect combination between S-class alpha and omega. The pheromone level, family background, and talent and appearance are very well-matched. This is normal and reasonable.Shen Dai slowly revealed a bitter smile.He was unsure if it was because Qu Moyu\u2019s \u2018mark\u2019 had disappeared that it was like he finally woke up from a dream. He finally realized how stupid he was to expect Qu Moyu to respond to his feelings. In the eyes of the S-class alpha, he is just a cheap stone, and his vain attempt to exchange the stone for real gold, silver, jade and diamond was not love. It was only greed to him. Thinking about how Qu Moyu had treated him, he understood how cheap and unbearable he is in Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes.He doesn\u2019t have the strength to love nor the strength to hate. He just wants to bring his life that has gone astray a little bit back on the right track.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.06.20\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: I just want Sundae to have a good life without Cuttlefish anymore.

He also wanted to buy some live grouper and a four-pound Dungeness crab. He grew up in the north and has no special preference for seafood. But this is in the northwest so the locals don\u2019t like to eat it. All these things are shipped here by air. They are fresh and expensive, and are suitable for treats and celebrations. And today it is for celebration. .They are celebrating Qiuqiu\u2019s 100th day and him completing his thesis.Shen Dai struggled to open the door and entered the house with two large plastic bags in his hands. A beta girl ran over from the house to take over: \u201cMr. Shen, why are you buying so many vegetables yourself? It\u2019s so heavy.\u201d The girl has a beautiful and simple look. She has a round face. Her name is Xiao Die. She is an intern at the research institute and a student of Bai Xiangwan. Shen Dai is not an employee there. She helped him to do some simple experiments and collect data. Along the way, he discovered that this girl is diligent and sensible. Not only is she very serious in study and work, but when she sees him alone with a child, she always takes the initiative to help. Shen Dai simply let her live with him, providing her with food, drink, lodging and salary.The house he rents now is also owned by Bai Xiangwan. This is the company\u2019s welfare apartment. It has been bought for a few years, but Bai Xiangwan lives in the dormitory of the research institute so he charges him a nominal rent. Because of the help of these two people, his life pressure is much less. Otherwise, he would be dragged down just by taking care of his own child.Shen Dai smiled and said, \u201cI went to get some seafood. Would you cook it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll follow the tutorial, what\u2019s so difficult?\u201d Xiao Die excitedly looked at the fish fluttering in the bag, \u201cWow, it\u2019s so big. It must be quite expensive.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s cheaper than eating out.\u201dAfter the two sorted out the ingredients, Shen Dai looked at his watch: \u201cI\u2019ll go see Qiuqiu. I\u2019ll be here to help you later.\u201d\u201cGo ahead. Teacher Bai is working overtime. He\u2019s definitely not going to reach here before half past six.\u201dShen Dai washed his hands and walked into the room quietly. In the crib, lay a fair, tender, chubby baby boy. He was sleeping soundly, with a small finger in his mouth, two lips that were moistened by saliva. He happily sucked on them, not knowing what he was dreaming about.Shen Dai looked at his little alpha with a soft expression that appeared like his heart has melted.Qiuqiu was born in the 36th week. Although he is still a little premature, according to the doctor\u2019s judgement on his condition, as the child grows older, the effectiveness of the substitute pheromone will decrease. In the absence of the alpha father\u2019s comfort, natural birth is more dangerous for him and the child, so he chooses to take him out earlier. Qiuqiu was thin and small when he was born. He was monitored in the hospital for half a month and Shen Dai was also anxious for half a month. Fortunately, the child finally returned home as healthy as can be.Qiuqiu is the child\u2019s nickname. Shen Dai\u2019s grandfather named him \u2018Dai\u2019, which is the big Mount Tai, so his son should be called \u2018Small Mount Qiu\u2019.Shen Dai slowly bent down, stroked the fluff of hair on Qiuqiu\u2019s head with his fingers, then lowered his head and gently sniffed the tip of his nose. Qiuqiu\u2019s pheromone is Longbai. The smell is very unique, similar to medicine. But it does not smell depressing. There is still a bit of refreshing smell under the fine taste. But the glands of the newborn baby have not yet fully developed. The scent of pheromone was very faint. It\u2019s a pheromone variety determined by genetic testing. Shen Dai smells the child from time to time. He smells more like a milk stench than a seemingly non-existent medicinal fragrance.Shen Dai smiled and gently kissed Qiuqiu\u2019s cheek. He never knew what it would feel like to have a child but now, it was as if no expression of love was enough. Although Qiuqiu\u2019s energy is terrifying and raising children is the most tiring job he has ever done in his life, he still likes it.After three months of recuperation, his body will gradually recover. He planned to take Qiuqiu back to the capital to see his grandmother and visit his teacher. If it wasn\u2019t for the special care of the teacher, even if Senior Brother Bai was willing to help him, he would not be able to enter and leave the institute as freely as a non-staff person. No one here knows him and no one inquires about his past. So his time is fairly smooth despite having the toughest time of his life.Although his past was kept hidden in the dark and he did not dare to look back, every time he looked at Qiuqiu, he felt that everything he had paid for was worth it.He went back to the kitchen to help Xiao Die prepare dinner together. The two chatted and laughed about Qiuqiu\u2019s growing up.\u201cBy the way, Mr. Shen, I read a popular science article yesterday. It said that in Qiuqiu\u2019s situation, alpha pheromone is needed for comfort before the age of three. But compared to the kind of decellularized pheromone or artificially synthesised pheromone, there is other pheromone that suits him better.\u201d\u201cI know. The doctor had mentioned it to me, but\u2026 forget it. He\u2019s doing fine now.\u201d Shen Dai knew what Xiaodie wanted to say. After a child is born, the child still needs pheromone from both parents in the process of growing up. Otherwise, the child will be easily panicked or anxious. However, the child requirements will not be as harsh as it was while they were in the mother\u2019s womb. When the parents\u2019 pheromone is lacking, if there are people who often appear around them and make them feel safe, such people\u2019s pheromone can also play a role. And now the only alpha who often has contact with Qiuqiu is Bai Xiangwan. But he felt that this request was inappropriate. Senior Brother Bai had already helped him too much. He always tried his best not to bother others. How could he be so embarrassed to ask someone to have a tube of gland fluid taken for no reason?\u201cBut I feel that the current alternative pheromones are not able to appease Qiuqiu. Qiuqiu\u2019s energy is too high. Sometimes I think it\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t have enough fun if he doesn\u2019t want to sleep, it may be that he doesn\u2019t feel safe.\u201d Xiao Die sighed. \u201cI have brought two alpha younger brothers from my hometown. But they are not so hyper. Qiuqiu\u2019s pheromone level should be quite high.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t tested it.\u201d Shen Dai thought to himself. Is the effect of substitute pheromone really bad? The doctor did remind him that after the child is born, he no longer relies on the mother\u2019s body to perceive the world, but has his own sensory system. At this time, whoever is close to him, he likes the taste of whoever that is. Obviously, Qiuqiu doesn\u2019t like the alternative pheromones now. He likes Bai Xiangwan\u2019s pheromone.\u201cNever tested?\u201d Xiao Die was very surprised. \u201cWhy?\u201dGenerally, the pheromone level will be tested immediately after giving birth to a child. C-class is mostly defective and B-class is the most common. If you got A-class, it is already good news to tell your relatives and friends. Not to mention in the event of good graciousness by Gods and you got an S-class instead\u2026Shen Dai smiled and said, \u201cI am against using the pheromone level to classify a newly born person into the classes. What kind of a person this child will become in the future and what kind of achievements he will achieve should be related to family, education, personality. His personal struggles are also closely related. A single and subjective data should not be used to draw conclusions. So I will not test him for pheromone levels. And I don\u2019t care. As long as he is healthy.\u201dXiao Die looked at Shen Dai with admiration on her face: \u201cMr. Shen, what you said is really good. No wonder you can achieve these achievements on your own.\u201d\u201cAnyone who is willing to work hard will open up a world of their own. Your teacher Bai is like that. And also my teacher, Professor Liu Xi, who is a beta, can still become a world-class rare earth expert.\u201dXiao Die nodded vigorously: \u201cProfessor Liu is our idol. And I will work hard!\u201dThe two prepared a hearty and delicious dinner, and when it was almost seven o\u2019clock, the doorbell rang.Shen Dai got up to open the door and said with a smile, \u201cWhy are you ringing the doorbell when you go back to your own house? It\u2019s rare that you\u2019re only 30 minutes late today.\u201dStanding outside the door is a tall and handsome male alpha. His appearance is very superior, with a tall nose, broad forehead and cold fair skin. His temperament is capable and restrained. But his hairstyle has no trace of styling and he has a lab coat with unknown stains and inside is a wrinkled shirt. This is simply the image of a standard science and engineering male who is quite sloppy and obsessed with scientific research.He is Bai Xiangwan, a fellow mate during Shen Dai\u2019s student days. At the age of thirty-two, he became the youngest Ph.D. supervisor of Lancheng University, the head of the Xingzhou Group\u2019s research institute in Gansu mining area, and Liu Xi\u2019s proudest eldest disciple.Bai Xiangwan showed the cake in his hand: \u201cTwenty minutes. Ten more minutes just to buy this.\u201d\u201cMr. Bai, you\u2019re here.\u201d Xiao Die took the cake diligently.Bai Xiangwan nodded to Xiao Die and asked, \u201cAh Dai, where is Qiuqiu?\u201d He began to look around to find the noise maker.\u201cHe is asleep.\u201d Shen Dai pointed to the back room, \u201cIt\u2019s rare for him to be quiet so let\u2019s eat first.\u201dXiao Die took credit and said, \u201cMr. Bai, I have prepared a lot of delicious food together with Mr. Shen. The crab that Mr. Shen bought was so big and it was alive. It should cost a lot.\u201d\u201cThen I have to taste it.\u201d Bai Xiangwan smiled and glanced at Shen Dai, his eyes were gentle and powerful, \u201cToday is worth celebrating.\u201dThe three sat down. Shen Dai poured three glasses of red wine. He raised his glass, took a deep breath, and suddenly felt a lot of emotion in his heart: \u201cI am very happy today. My thesis needs some revisions and final checks but it\u2019s basically completed. And today is the 100th day of Qiuqiu. I want to thank you all. Thanks to Senior Brother Bai, Xiao Die\u2026 without your help, I don\u2019t know how embarrassing my life would be.\u201d At the end of his speech, his nasal cavity feels sour and his eyes are a little red, \u201cReally. Thank you.\u201dShen Dai looked back on all the hardships he had experienced this year. The hardships were indescribable. He had endured night after night of pain, anxiety, fatigue, and self-doubt. Until now, he has not completely gotten rid of the shadow that Qu Moyu placed on him. But at least he is getting better every day. At least when he thinks of Qiuqiu, his heart is full of strength. He can survive, thanks to the support of Senior Brother Bai and Xiao Die. He had met such nice people.Xiao Die smirked: \u201cMr. Shen, I can learn things while I\u2019m with you. I also have food and shelter. And I especially like Qiuqiu, so please don\u2019t be polite to me.\u201dBai Xiangwan also smiled and said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, it\u2019s not worth mentioning.\u201dShen Dai looked at the two of them gratefully: \u201cI toast this glass of wine to you two.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s eat!\u201d Xiaodie happily clapped her hands, \u201cQiuqiu 100th day. I hope he is healthy, happy, sleeps more and less screaming. Hope hegrows into a handsome guy soon!\u201dA happy smile appeared on Shen Dai\u2019s face.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.06.21\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: I still have fantasies about Senior Brother Bai being with SD instead of QMY.

So he woke him up. The little guy was reluctant that he howled a few times but after being held in his arms by Bai Xiangwan, he was inexplicably not irritable. He grabbed Bai Xiangwan\u2019s button and played with it seriously.\u201cHe recognizes you very well now and he can be quiet with you.\u201d Shen Dai said helplessly.Bai Xiangwan grabbed Qiuqiu\u2019s tender little face with his thumb and index finger, pinched it gently, and said with a smile, \u201cHe likes my pheromones.\u201dQiuqiu seemed to agree, raised his head and grinned.Bai Xiangwan\u2019s pheromone is the scent of elm. The fruit core of this tree is used as medicine to soothe the nerves. Although it is also of woody scent, it is not bitter. Instead, it smells like a warm feeling full of sunshine and vitality, just like Bai Xiangwan himself. This person is just as down-to-earth and powerful and it is no wonder that Qiuqiu likes him.Recently, Qiuqiu has become more and more out of shape. It is completely different from the weak, wrinkled and small appearance when he was first born. His eyes are round, big and bright. His nose is upturned. His skin is fair and tender. And his head has only a few layers of fluff. The child is amazing looking. He is beautiful at every turn. It is the kind of the beautiful baby that would appear in baby product commercials. People who have seen him say that he looks like Shen Dai, but Shen Dai thinks he looks more like Qu Moyu no matter what. And he doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s just a psychological effect.\u201cLook at his legs.\u201d Bai Xiangwan straightened one of Qiuqiu\u2019s fleshy legs, \u201cAccording to the proportions of his body, this child has long hands and feet, so he will definitely be tall in the future.\u201d\u201cYeah, he is an alpha after all.\u201d Shen Dai smiled, \u201cHe can\u2019t be bullied.\u201d\u201cXiao Die said he is very noisy now?\u201d\u201cWell, he\u2019s too energetic. I\u2019m going to hire another nanny for the night shift. Otherwise, Xiao Die and I will take turns to wake up at night, and we\u2019ll be so sleepy during the day that we won\u2019t be able to work well.\u201d\u201cQiuqiu does not want to sleep might be due to lack of security. He is in need of Alpha Omega pheromones to comfort him now. If the baby is insecure, he will cry.\u201d Bai Xiangwan handed Qiuqiu to Shen Dai\u2019s arms and took something out from his briefcase and handed a piece of paper to Shen Dai, \u201cThis is my 100th day gift to Qiuqiu.\u201dShen Dai took it over quizzically. When he saw it, it was the receipt of the city hospital: \u201cThis is\u2026?\u201d\u201cI went to the city hospital to make some essential oils for Qiuqiu to soothe the pheromone. The nurse said that it will be ready in three days. You can pick it up tomorrow.\u201dShen Dai stared blankly at Bai Xiangwan: \u201cSenior brother\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the only alpha Qiuqiu has access to now and he also likes my pheromones. Isn\u2019t that what it should be?\u201d Bai Xiangwan poked Qiuqiu\u2019s fat belly and joked, \u201cTake me as a father, yes? Right?\u201dShen Dai was very embarrassed. Bai Xiangwan and him didn\u2019t have a deep friendship when they were in college. After Bai Xiangwan was transferred to Lancheng, they only had occasional contacts for work. Bai Xiangwan is not obliged to help him like this, but over the past year, he has been helped a lot by him. How will he be able to repay such kindness? He sighed softly and said with a smile, \u201cSenior Brother Bai, I don\u2019t even know how to thank you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just me drawing some blood, it\u2019s not a big deal. The nurse said that the essential oil from the gland fluid can be used for a year and it would no longer be necessary if Qiuqiu is older.\u201d\u201cWell, I also thank you on behalf of Qiuqiu.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say thank you. You also worked for me for a few months for free. When your body recovers, can you consider joining me for a position?\u201dShen Dai looked at Bai Xiangwan hesitantly and felt hesitated.\u201cAh Dai, you seem to be avoiding something. I know you don\u2019t want to say it and the teacher told me not to ask you. But everyone has a past and everyone has to move forward. If you tell me your difficulties, maybe I can help you. At least it\u2019s totally fine for me to give you a stable job.\u201d\u201cI know. I\u2019ve recovered. And I\u2019m definitely looking for a job.\u201d Shen Dai smiled bitterly, \u201cMy situation is really embarrassing right now. My file is still in the research institute in Beijing. I\u2019m currently on a major sick leave. And I haven\u2019t officially handed in my resignation. Although your side is an independent site, the personal tax and social security cannot be transferred. I have to go back to the capital to solve these matters.\u201d\u201cCall the teacher and walk through the process with him. It should be done quickly.\u201dShen Dai smiled and nodded: \u201cYes. After a while, I will.\u201d He has to consider far more than just a job. He has to think about what to do with Qiuqiu, what to do with his grandmother, and how to plan his career in the future. All these problems need to be solved urgently.Bai Xiangwan stared at Shen Dai for a few seconds: \u201cYour main problem isn\u2019t this, right? It\u2019s related to\u2026 Qiuqiu, right?\u201dShen Dai knew what Bai Xiangwan really wanted to say was \u2018Qiuqiu\u2019s alpha father\u2019. In fact, he felt that Bai Xiangwan knew something. There were many of their classmates and colleagues in the capital and the rare earth industry circle was very small so gossip flew easily. As long as Bai Xiangwan has heard a little rumour, he can guess what happened after a little analysis. But Bai Xiangwan has kept his mouth shut, which makes Shen Dai very grateful.Shen Dai nodded: \u201cHowever, don\u2019t worry. I will deal with it as soon as possible.\u201d He couldn\u2019t let his savings go on like this. Although Lancheng\u2019s consumption level was low, it was still very frustrating to just sit and eat and have no income.\u201cOkay, I expect you to officially come to work in my laboratory.\u201d Bai Xiangwan looked at his watch, \u201cI\u2019m going back first. I have a report to write. I\u2019m checking the information regarding the question you asked me a few days ago. I will discuss it with you when I\u2019m done with it.\u201d\u201cOkay, see you later.\u201dShen Dai held Qiuqiu to see Bai Xiangwan off. Qiuqiu was still cheerful at first, but as soon as Bai Xiangwan opened the door, he had a premonition, so he cried loudly and his little hand was pointing in the direction of the door, trying to grab him back in the air.\u201cOkay. Don\u2019t cry. You are overreacting.\u201d Shen Dai felt that his eardrums were buzzing.Bai Xiangwan held back his laughter and backed away. He wrapped Qiuqiu\u2019s little paws and gave a soft \u2018shh\u2019.Qiuqiu stopped crying immediately. With tears in his eyes, he looks at Bai Xiangwan.\u201cSenior brother, don\u2019t be so accustomed to him. He is too dependent on you and it will be even more difficult for us to coax him.\u201dBai Xiangwan came over, suddenly lowered his head and pressed it against Qiuqiu\u2019s face. He released a little pheromone and coaxed him softly, \u201cDon\u2019t make trouble, Qiuqiu.\u201dQiuqiu was obviously calm, but he was in Shen Dai\u2019s arms. They were so close. Bai Xiangwan\u2019\u2019s gentle and steady pheromone invaded Shen Dai\u2019s nerves so unpreparedly. Shen Dai was stunned for a moment. There is a tingling feeling in his scalp.Since he washed off the \u2018mark\u2019 more than a year ago, his glandular function has become more sluggish than before. Not only the taste of epiphyllum pheromones has become weaker. But also the ability to perceive other people\u2019s pheromones has also decreased. Washing the \u2018mark\u2019 would have caused a certain degree of damage to the glands, not to mention that he was not given anaesthesia at the time. It was an experience he was most afraid to recall. At that time, he was tied to the operating table like a lamb to be slaughtered and endured the severe pain. It still causes nervous tingling in the back of his neck from time to time and because of his screams and struggles, the doctor is naturally frightened and restrained when he starts the operation. The effect of the operation and postoperative recovery are greatly reduced.However, for him now, if it is not for raising his own children, the gland is almost useless. If it is damaged, then it is damaged. But just now he sensed Bai Xiangwan\u2019s pheromone, and his body even had a normal response when it received the invasion of the opposite sex pheromone. This proved that his gland function had recovered somewhat. This is a good thing, after all, no one wants to have a problem with their body parts.Bai Xiangwan stood up straight and took a step back, staring at Shen Dai: \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d His eyes were more of an inquiry than an apology for accidentally offending others.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Shen Dai grabbed Qiuqiu\u2019s little hand and waved it, smiling, \u201cGoodbye to Uncle Bai.\u201dAfter Bai Xiangwan left, Xiao Die started to clean up. She washed some strawberries. The three of them sat on the sofa eating while watching a movie.\u201cWhy is Qiuqiu so good today?\u201d Xiao Die asked casually.\u201cYour teacher Bai left some pheromone on him.\u201d\u201cOh, I heard that Teacher Bai\u2019s pheromone smells very good, is it White Elm?\u201d\u201cHmm, it smells good.\u201dXiaodie turned her head to look at Shen Dai and said with a smile, \u201cMr. Shen, Teacher Bai is so kind to you.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Shen Dai said with emotion, \u201cHe went to the hospital to make pheromone essential oil for Qiuqiu, which made me very embarrassed.\u201d\u201cWow.\u201d Xiaodie\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cMr. Bai is a workaholic. He is usually very cold to people. I think he is the most gentle to you. And he treats Qiuqiu as his own son.\u201dSpeaking of this, if Shen Dai doesn\u2019t understand what Xiao Die means, he is definitely stupid. But unfortunately, he can only pretend to be stupid: \u201cSenior brother is just not good at communication.\u201d\u201cIndeed, so Teacher Bai treats you\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a bit late. I\u2019ll go coax Qiuqiu to sleep first.\u201d Shen Dai couldn\u2019t deal with such a stubborn problem. Between him and Bai Xiangwan, there shouldn\u2019t be any awareness of thinking in that direction.Xiao Die blinked and looked at Shen Dai. She hesitated for a while and didn\u2019t speak further.Shen Dai took the warm baby bottle and carried Qiuqiu into the room. Qiuqiu still drank deliciously at first, but after a while, he started to fight his sleepiness. In the end, he couldn\u2019t open his eyes and his little mouth was still sucking the bottle.Shen Dai just stared at Qiuqiu like that, with a smile on his face.Qiuqiu fell asleep. Shen Dai wiped his mouth, put him in the crib, and continued to watch him quietly.The world of adults is always windy and rainy, but when he looks at this child, his soul can get a short period of peace and comfort. He is grateful every day for the existence of Qiuqiu. It gives him endless power, allowing him to face everything that frightens him.It\u2019s time for him to face the world. It is for his own future and for Qiuqiu.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.06.22\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: I really want Senior Brother Bai to marry SD. T.T!!! Head\u2019s up.

The fragrance of elm is very strong and the retention time is very long. As long as he uses it more in Qiuqiu\u2019s daily necessities and activity space, he can simulate an environment where an alpha accompanies him.The doctor also suggested that Shen Dai use the essential oil of elm to make some perfumes, which he could usually spray on himself. In essence, it is to simulate the family atmosphere of a normal Alpha-Omega couple, which will have a better effect on Qiuqiu\u2019s emotional comfort. Although this suggestion is good, Shen Dai doesn\u2019t intend to do it. The perfume using Bai Xiangwan\u2019s pheromone to be used on him would be so embarrassing for the two of them.But when he got home, Shen Dai realised that his worries were unnecessary. It was not because he suddenly figured it out, but after he used Bai Xiangwan\u2019s pheromone essential oil for Qiuqiu, he found that he couldn\u2019t avoid having the scent on himself at all.When Xiao Die came home from work, she also smelled the scent of white elm. Beta was originally unable to smell pheromone, but there are other formulas in the essential oil to reconcile and stabilise the scent, which will make the smell of the pheromone stand out.Xiao Die sniffed hard against Qiuqiu, and said in surprise, \u201cWow, this is Teacher Bai\u2019s pheromone? It smells good. It\u2019s a kind of steady and gentle feeling, exactly like Teacher Bai.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s no wonder Qiuqiu likes it very much.\u201d As expected, Qiuqiu was as well-behaved and quiet as if Bai Xiangwan was by his side.\u201cAlthough Teacher Bai is a bit serious, he takes special care of us and is very good to you. They always say that Mr. Bai\u2019s pheromone smells good. This is the first time I smell it.\u201d Xiao Die took Qiuqiu\u2019s little hand and exaggeratedly said, \u201cYour Highness, you now have the Alpha-Omega pheromone you like and you can be less noisy in the future. Please spare the slaves\u2019 life.\u201dShen Dai smiled and said, \u201cXiao Die, I went to the hospital today and went to the housekeeping company. I interviewed a few aunties. I want to find a night shift nanny as soon as possible, otherwise it will delay your work. It will be settled in the next few days.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great. We may get very busy soon. The institute is going to enter new projects.\u201d\u201cWhat new project?\u201d Shen Dai became interested. The new project means there will be more funds and more on site practice. That means he can learn a lot. Although the research institute in Jingcheng represents the highest technical level of Xingzhou, it only does scientific research there. Meanwhile, Lancheng really has mines. The research institute here has to participate in the process of prospecting, mining, preliminary screening, pretreatment, and preprocessing. In layman\u2019s terms, although the Lancheng Research Institute also studies the extraction and refining technology of rare earths, it pays more attention to the prospecting, mining and processing in the early stage. There is a difference in the knowledge that he can access between these two places.\u201cNew production line!\u201d Xiao Die\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cHeadquarters has decided to cooperate with Longke Heavy Industry to upgrade our production line.\u201dShen Dai was a little surprised: \u201cBut isn\u2019t the new production line going to be placed in a new mining area?\u201dIn order to achieve carbon emission reduction targets, the state urges mining companies to upgrade, improve mining technology and production lines to adapt to new environmental protection standards. After all, mining will cause a heavily polluted area. But such upgrades cost a lot and few companies can afford the high cost. The production and the cost has to be properly weighed when deciding whether to reduce or stop production completely. This is also the main reason for the downturn in the industry in recent years.After Xingzhou\u2019s acquisition of Chuanghai was completed, Chuanghai\u2019s most promising Tarikam mining area will be included in the bag. This mine is a virgin mine with low trial and error costs and is most suitable for implementing new equipment and technologies. Shen Dai recalled that he and Qu Moyu had talked about this topic at the beginning and the two had basically the same idea. Qu Moyu also proposed to let him lead the formation of a team and promised him the position.Thinking of what kind of intimate atmosphere the two had for them to have had such a conversation at that time, Shen Dai\u2019s heart still clenched unconsciously. During the year, although he also complained about hard work and fatigue, sometimes he was glad that the hard work and fatigue filled his life and spirit. It left him with little free time to think about that unbearable relationship. Even in the night, when he couldn\u2019t help thinking of Qu Moyu, he would look forward to the cry of Qiuqiu, so that he could transfer his turbulent emotions.Xiao Die said: \u201cThere is such a rumor. But according to my Senior Sister, the above has changed their mind. It may be that the implementation of the new production line is too slow, so the two ends are parallel and our side is already upgraded in place.\u201dShen Dai nodded and said indifferently: \u201cThat\u2019s reasonable.\u201d After Qu Moyu got engaged to Zhou Xiaochu, he soon negotiated a huge amount of financing from the bank through the Zhou family\u2019s relationship and took the lead in upgrading the production line. In front of other competing companies, it is conceivable that once the news is announced, the stock price will usher in a wave of rise.\u201cThere will be an inspection from the headquarters in two days. Who do you think will come?\u201d Xiao Die suddenly jumped up.Shen Dai\u2019s heart trembled slightly: \u201c\u2026Who?\u201d\u201cYan Mingxiu!\u201d Xiao Die said expectantly, \u201cI liked him when I was in school and I still like him now. I wonder if there is a chance to get an autograph.\u201dShen Dai secretly let out a sigh of relief.\u201cThen, our crown prince and Professor Liu will also come.\u201d Compared with Yan Mingxiu, Xiao Die was obviously calmer when he mentioned these two people, \u201cI haven\u2019t met them before.\u201dShen Dai froze immediately. He came back to his senses, took out his mobile phone from his coat pocket, opened it, and sure enough, there was a message sent to him by Liu Xi. He has been busy since the afternoon and has not had time to look at his mobile phone.This Thursday. That is the day after tomorrow\u2026\u201cMr. Shen, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Xiao Die saw that Shen Dai\u2019s face was off.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s nothing.\u201d Shen Dai handed Qiuqiu to Xiao Die, \u201cYou look after him for a while, I\u2019ll go to the bathroom.\u201dShen Dai hid in the bathroom and called Liu Xi. He learned from Liu Xi that the project group attaches great importance to this project. The members of the inspection team are very important. The preliminary negotiation has basically been completed and the on-site inspection is more of just a formality. Coupled with the media momentum, it will definitely inject a stimulant into the entire industry.The master and apprentice hadn\u2019t seen each other for a long time so they made an appointment to meet on Saturday. Liu Xi wanted to see Qiuqiu very much. For Shen Dai, it was like taking Qiuqiu to see the elders at home. He was also very emotional.The news that a delegation composed of Xingzhou Group and Longke Heavy Industry came to Lancheng has become a hot topic in the local area. This production line upgrade will definitely bring more income and employment to the local area. And Yan Mingxiu himself is already the talk of town.Shen Dai didn\u2019t want to pay attention to the news, but this was an information age, and many contents were forcibly fed into his ears and eyes. He was forced to see Qu Moyu in the media feed.After a quick glance, Qu Moyu seems to have lost some weight. But his momentum has not diminished. He and Yan Mingxiu appear in the same frame. Unlike a commercial inspection, it looked more like an opening ceremony of a film festival. The two S-class alphas will inevitably become the focus of the camera.Shen Dai quickly closed the page. Although he was very interested in this project, he didn\u2019t plan to watch any news content. He might as well wait for Bai Xiangwan to finish his work and ask the general manager of the project himself in person.When he heard the knock on the door, Shen Dai jumped up from the sofa and strode to the door. In front of him was Professor Liu Xi, whom he hadn\u2019t seen for almost two years. With a smile on his face, when he looked at Shen Dai, his eyes gradually turned from joy to a bit of sadness.Shen Dai\u2019s eyes were red too: \u201cTeacher.\u201d This \u2018Teacher\u2019 sounded respectful and nostalgic. It sounded like some children were aggrieved and depended on their parents the moment they saw them.Liu Xi sighed and spread his arms. The master and apprentice hugged heavily.For Shen Dai, this is like a year after wandering abroad and reuniting with his family. The grief in his heart is beyond words but in the end, he can only smile with restraint.Shen Dai let Liu Xi into the house. Liu Xi looked left and right: \u201cWhere\u2019s the little guy?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s sleeping in the room. I\u2019ll show you inside.\u201dThe two crept into the room. Qiuqiu was sleeping soundly in the crib. Liu Xi stood aside, even his breathing became consciously shallow. He smiled and looked at Qiuqiu without saying a word for a long time. Finally, he reached out his hand and touched Qiuqiu\u2019s little face lightly.After exiting the room, Shen Dai closed the door, and only then did Liu Xi dare to speak: \u201cThis child is so beautiful. So good. He looked even better than in the video call.\u201dShen Dai smiled and said, \u201cHe is not full-grown yet. He was ugly when he was born. He was weak and small. Now he has grown a little.\u201dLiu Xi sighed, \u201cYou must have suffered.\u201d\u201cFortunately, it\u2019s not all bad.\u201d Shen Dai looked calm, \u201cIf everyone wants children to be like this, they must suffer a little.\u201dLiu Xi looked at Shen Dai distressedly: \u201cYou are still different from everyone else.\u201dShen Dai was startled but then smiled.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been long since you gave birth. You haven\u2019t gotten fat at all. Instead, you seem to be thinner than before.\u201d\u201cHaha, I will recover quickly.\u201d Shen Dai took all the hardships with little words.\u201cIs it alright here? Xiangwan took good care of you.\u201d\u201cThanks to Senior Brother Bai, he took special care of me. The house is also his. The rent is only half of my local average price. He also sent his student to help me. Thank you teacher for connecting me with him.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s as it should be.\u201d Liu Xi said, \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about your future for a while now, whether to transfer or leave, and how to transfer your files and social security. This time with Mr. Qu, I came out to investigate and look for opportunities. I want to find out what he said.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Shen Dai said hesitantly, \u201cTeacher, let me just quit.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You don\u2019t have to go through him and he may not even know about it. Even if he knows, he might not interfere. It\u2019s been a year and he doesn\u2019t know that you gave birth to a child. You two are now\u2026 It doesn\u2019t matter. I just pretended to know nothing and transferred you from Beijing to Lancheng. It is just in time to help Xiangwan complete this project.\u201dShen Dai thought about it for a while. Maybe what the teacher said made sense. For Qu Moyu, he was just a former bed partner, he consciously washed off the \u2018mark\u2019 and knocked out the child. He had disappeared since then. Qu Moyu will only feel less of a hassle.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.06.23\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: Prepare for some uncalled-for jealousy in the next chapter.

He deliberately avoids talking about the hardships of the year. Even if Liu Xi asked, it was useless for him to complain to anyone. Why should he let his teacher worry so much about him? He directed the topic to his thesis and asked a lot of questions while the teacher was there with him.After the meal, Shen Dai woke Qiuqiu up. Liu Xi made a video call to Cheng Zimei and the three people teased the child together. For a while, they seemed to be transported back in the past.After Liu Xi left, Shen Dai put Qiuqiu on the bed to play by himself and he went to clean up the dishes.Just as soon as he finished with the cleaning, his doorbell rang. Shen Dai thought that Liu Xi had forgotten something so he washed his hands and went to open the door.The moment the door opened, both the person inside and outside frozen in their spot.The heir of the Xingzhou Group, whom he had casually glanced at in the news video, suddenly stood in front of him. He had lost a little weight and he has eyebags under his eyes. The former bright eyes were a little gloomy, but they were still looking so dazzling, extravagant, and straightforward. The corridor of the commercial building cannot be a background that is fitted for such a person. He looked out of place.Shen Dai looked at this man whom he had done all kinds of intimate things with and he felt extremely strange. He imagined seeing Qu Moyu again but he couldn\u2019t figure out how to face him. So he decided that it\u2019s better not to see him at all.Qu Moyu also looked at Shen Dai. Shen Dai\u2019s hair has grown a little longer and it hangs loose without trimming. His skin is getting paler and his eyes are gloomy, as if covered with a layer of fog that cannot be dissolved. With a calm bearing, the figure of the lower limbs of the clothing has just the right sense of strength, like a steep green bamboo. But now, Shen Dai\u2019s face looked like he was unwell and Shen Dai\u2019s eyes portrayed tiredness. It was as if he would shatter completely if he was lightly bumped into.Qu Moyu\u2019s heart was congested with the anger that had never really subsided in the past year. It began clamouring all over his body again. He really wanted to ask Shen Dai why he wanted to live like this without him but he restrained himself. So, his face looked calm as he asked: \u201cAren\u2019t you going to invite me in?\u201dShen Dai felt that his whole chest was shaking with panic, resistance and anxiety. These are all the negative emotions that Qu Moyu had given him before. They were awakened again from the depths of his memory. He thought that one day he would be able to face the bleakest part of his life. But now he is not ready. His hand gripped the doorframe as if it were his wall.In order to see the teacher today, he had asked Xiao Die to go back to the school tonight. It was only him and Qiuqiu at home. How could he let Qu Moyu come in?Seeing Shen Dai\u2019s hesitation, Qu Moyu knew that he couldn\u2019t wait for the invitation. He didn\u2019t need it either. So he walked in.As Qu Moyu approached, the tall and sturdy body fell down on Shen Dai like a mountain. Shen Dai took a few steps back. His door closed in front of him. It was as if his city wall collapsed in front of him.Qu Moyu looked around: \u201cThis is the company\u2019s welfare room. Did Professor Liu arrange for you to live here?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhose shoes and stuff are these?\u201d Qu Moyu glanced at the daily necessities that were obviously women\u2019s. Judging from the size of the shoes, they didn\u2019t look like female alphas. Omegas hardly had any relationship with women other than female alphas.\u201cA nanny.\u201d Shen Dai replied casually. His nerves were tense. Qiuqiu was in the bedroom. It was best if the child had fallen asleep at the moment, \u201cMr. Qu, what brings you here?\u201dHearing this, Qu Moyu turned around, narrowed his eyes slightly, and anger flashed in his eyes. He spent half a year, while dealing with the work that made him devastated, while hesitating in the resentment that Shen Dai dared to leave without saying goodbye, and in the end, he decided to look for Shen Dai. A month ago, he found out the whereabouts of Shen Dai, arranged the company\u2019s affairs properly, and planned out his decision. This time, Lancheng and his party were here for the new project and he was also here for Shen Dai.\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to be transferred? You\u2019re still on sick leave. So you would just walk away? What\u2019s so good about this place? Why do you have to come here with the good treatment I can give you in the capital?!\u201dThe more Qu Moyu said, the louder he became. Shen Dai took a deep breath, fearing that it would attract Qiuqiu\u2019s attention. He whispered, \u201cThen, can I be transferred?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201dQu Moyu walked in front of Shen Dai in a few steps. It forced Shen Dai to the wall. He looked down at Shen Dai condescendingly. He then said word by word, \u201cFollow me back.\u201d His tone was that of an uncompromising command.Shen Dai has not experienced the pressure of an alpha for a long time, especially this alpha who used pheromone suppression on him. The fear is still imprinted in his memory. His head feels too heavy to be lifted up. He can only say in a low voice: \u201cIf I can\u2019t be transferred, I\u2019ll resign.\u201dQu Moyu supported the wall with one hand, bent down slightly, shrouded Shen Dai in his shadow, and said coldly, \u201cYou say that again.\u201dShen Dai started to tremble to even breathe.Seeing Shen Dai\u2019s shrinking appearance, Qu Moyu felt a little distressed. Although his anger remained, he didn\u2019t mean to scare Shen Dai. So he gently stroked his soft hair and softened his voice: \u201cAh Dai, follow me. Let\u2019s go back together and we\u2019ll talk. I\u2019ve told you that I\u2019ll give you a good life and my words still count now.\u201dWhen Shen Dai thinks of himself in the past, he will always get lost in Qu Moyu\u2019s hypocritical tenderness. But now, he only feels that his hair is standing on end. A baby\u2019s cry suddenly came from the house.Qu Moyu turned his head in astonishment. Shen Dai pinched his thighs and forced himself to calm down. The best way to get rid of fear is to face it.Qu Moyu glanced at Shen Dai, turned and walked to the bedroom. He pushed open the hidden door and saw a small alpha lying in the crib next to the big bed, staring at the other alpha with his big eyes looking at him curiously. At the same time, he smelled the familiar scent of pheromones in the bedroom. In addition to Shen Dai\u2019s elegant ephemeral fragrance, there was also another alpha\u2019s scent.This is obviously Shen Dai\u2019s bedroom and there is another alpha pheromone in the room, and even the child on the bed is covered in that smell! Qu Moyu suddenly felt like his heart and lungs had exploded. He glared at Shen Dai fiercely, his bloodshot eyes and wolf-like expression instantly made Shen Dai\u2019s legs go soft.The soaring jealousy instantly overwhelmed Qu Moyu\u2019s sanity. The emotions that had been suppressed during the year broke out. The dull pain in his chest made him look like a beast that was attacked. He always used counterattacks as defences. He grabbed Shen Dai\u2019s collar and pushed him to the closet door. With a loud bang, Qiuqiu burst into tears.\u201cBe with someone else so soon? Even having a child with him?\u201d Qu Moyu bared his fangs, wishing he could bite Shen Dai\u2019s neck and let this person who dared to give him pain and humiliation taste the price of betraying him.Shen Dai was overwhelmed by the pheromone released by Qu Moyu. But he was more worried about Qiuqiu than himself. He held onto Qu Moyu\u2019s iron-like arm and tremblingly begged: \u201cYou don\u2019t do this. The child can\u2019t take it.\u201dShen Dai couldn\u2019t imagine how much pressure the S-class alpha pheromone would put on a baby.Qu Moyu turned a deaf ear, held Shen Dai\u2019s neck, and tore off the thin pheromone sticker. He didn\u2019t smell any \u2018mark\u2019 on Shen Dai, but he wanted to confirm. The glands, where his teeth marks had been cut after him cleaning off the \u2018mark\u2019, were now only ugly white scars.Shen Dai felt as if someone had uncovered his long-standing wound on the spot. The pain of the flesh had gone, but the torture on the soul never went away. All the memories of pain and humiliation came pouring out so he roared: \u201cLet go of me!\u201dFacing Shen Dai\u2019s struggle, Qu Moyu used two strong thighs to sandwich Shen Dai\u2019s legs, sniffed hard on Shen Dai\u2019s glands, and finally determined that his omega hadn\u2019t been marked by others. He opened his mouth. His itchy canine teeth rubbed hard on the glands, wanting to bite down hard. His things that were touched by others, he wanted to get them back!After Shen Dai struggled a few times, he lost his strength. Qu Moyu\u2019s questioning and Qiuqiu\u2019s sharp cry made his brain buzz. He was really worried about Qiuqiu. Qiuqiu didn\u2019t have an alpha father during the pregnancy and growth stages. He lacked this companionship and security so it was easy for him to be stressed. Shen Dai cried and begged: \u201cPresident Qu, please.\u201dQu Moyu glanced at Qiuqiu who was crying with a livid face. He dragged Shen Dai out of the bedroom and slammed the door shut.Shen Dai tried to break free from Qu Moyu\u2019s control again. He wanted to go to appease Qiuqiu, but Qu Moyu threw him on the sofa, his eyes looked scary.Shen Dai gritted her teeth and looked back at Qu Moyu. His eyes were bursting with hatred that could not be concealed.Qu Moyu\u2019s every nerve was pierced by the look of those eyes. It caused him to be stunned. He couldn\u2019t believe that one day Shen Dai would look at him like this. He desperately controlled his irritable emotions and sat down next to Shen Dai. He lowered his head, pondered for a moment, waiting for his reason to gradually return, and his brain began to think.In the bedroom, Qiuqiu was still crying non-stop. The door had decreased the sound insulation for a bit, but it still grabbed the hearts of the two adults.Shen Dai really wanted to go see his child, but he didn\u2019t dare to move.After a long time, Qu Moyu raised his head. His eyes were full of bloodshot eyes and the blue veins on his forehead bulged. It was as if he had endured his emotions to the limit: \u201cI have smelled that pheromone before. It\u2019s Bai Xiangwan\u2019s, right?\u201dShen Dai looked at Qu Moyu defensively.\u201cThe child. Is it his?\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s voice trembled uncontrollably, \u201cOr is it mine?\u201d He didn\u2019t expect that one day he would ask this question with a faint expectation. The child that he didn\u2019t want and shouldn\u2019t want at all, Shen Dai had aborted a year ago, and the doctor had told him with great certainty that if the mark was washed off, the child would not be left, but in terms of time, perhaps, perhaps\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s not yours.\u201d Shen Dai said firmly without hesitation.Qiuqiu is only his child.Qu Moyu\u2019s heart hurt as if a piece of it had been gouged out. He looked at Shen Dai sideways, his eyes seemed to be fierce: \u201cYou and Bai Xiangwan are both students of Liu Xi. You must have known each other since college. Maybe there was something between you two before. So that\u2019s why you asked to be transferred to Lancheng.

What else do you want?\u201dQu Moyu intertwined his fingers and slowly tightened his grip. He gave a cruel smile: \u201cWhat do I want? What do you think?

Before Shen Dai could clean up his heart that was crushed again and again, he hurried into the bedroom to see Qiuqiu.Qiuqiu was crying and hiccuping. His face was covered with tears and snot. He looked very pitiful.Shen Dai held Qiuqiu\u2019s neck, carefully hugged him into his arms, and patted his back lightly: \u201cBe good. Dad is here. Don\u2019t be afraid. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201dThe pheromone released by Shen Dai calmed Qiuqiu\u2019s emotions. The crying gradually weakened from yelping to whimpering. Qiuqiu\u2019s small body twitched. His face flushed and his long eyelashes were stained with a string of little water droplets.Shen Dai wiped Qiuqiu\u2019s face with a tissue. After wiping his face, he wiped the clothes stained with tears and snot. But the more he wiped, the more water droplets dripped on the clothes and Shen Dai\u2019s vision became blurred as he stared wide. It was from his own eyes. He quickly wiped away his tears. He kept telling himself that it was nothing. The severe pain when washing the marks without anaesthesia, the pain and discomfort all over the body, the sadness of going to the maternity examination alone, and never being able to do anything after giving birth to Qiuqiu. One hundred nights of sleep for a complete restless sleep were more torturous than Qu Moyu\u2019s few words. But he survived all of them. He survived the weakest physical and psychological stage in his life. There was also a person here who he wanted to protect. Nothing else can defeat him after going through all that.Shen Dai stayed up almost all night and couldn\u2019t sleep at all. Qiuqiu\u2019s mood was very unstable. He was so hungry that he wanted to drink milk. All night, Shen Dai was exhausted physically and mentally. He only dozed off for a bit intermittently until Xiao Die came back at noon.Xiao Die was shocked when she saw Shen Dai\u2019s blue and swollen eyes that she got into a state of depression: \u201cMr. Shen, what\u2019s wrong with you? Is Qiuqiu keeping you awake at night again?\u201dShen Dai nodded: \u201cI ordered a takeaway. Please help me look after Qiuqiu for a while after dinner. I want to sleep.\u201d\u201cOkay, hurry up and eat. And go to sleep after eating.\u201dShen Dai clearly felt very hungry, but he couldn\u2019t eat anything. So the takeaway food was too oily and it was full of spices, which was really hard for him to swallow.\u201cMr. Shen, have you used Teacher Bai\u2019s pheromone essential oil? Isn\u2019t that able to appease Qiuqiu?\u201d\u201cI used it. Maybe there are times when it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Shen Dai couldn\u2019t tell Xiao Die that Qiuqiu was frightened by his biological father. How ironic. The pheromone of the alpha father who was supposed to accompany and comfort the child\u2019s growth induces horror in the child instead.\u201cThat\u2019s really troublesome. If Teacher Bai\u2019s pheromone also fails in the future, what will Qiuqiu do?\u201dShen Dai was also worried but there\u2019s nothing he could do now.Xiao Die realised that she shouldn\u2019t mention this so she quickly changed the subject: \u201cMr. Shen, you know, I\u2019m dying of anger today.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cIn the morning, we held an internal meeting in the research institute. I was quite excited because I was sitting in that position and was quite close to the prince. Wow, he\u2019s so tall and handsome, with a unique aura. He deserves to be an S-class alpha.\u201dShen Dai froze for a moment.\u201cAs a result, he is very strange today. I think he\u2019s a little bit deliberately picking faults and embarrassing Teacher Bai.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIn the project seminar the day before yesterday, the prince praised Mr. Bai and our institute in front of Yan Mingxiu and the media. Every sentence was more beautiful than the other. As a result, he was the only one today whose words were obviously thorny. Professor Liu helped Teacher Bai, he almost made Professor Liu unable to come off the stage. I just don\u2019t understand. Is he deliberately getting rid of grudges?\u201dShen Dai put down the bowls and chopsticks with a sullen face. He couldn\u2019t believe that Qu Moyu, who paid so much attention to his career, would avenge his personal revenge. He must know that his teacher is looked up to in academia and he is a highly respected existence everywhere. Although Bai Xiangwan is young, he is also an industry leader. He is a talent that all institutions are competing for. How could Qu Moyu embarrass him in public?Xiao Die sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to guess what the boss is thinking and it was not easy for Teacher Bai.\u201dShen Dai realised that Qu Moyu was angrier than he thought. If it wasn\u2019t for him, neither the teacher nor Senior Brother Bai would have to suffer. He must think about what to do next. When Qu Moyu gives it some thought, he will definitely have some doubts about Qiuqiu\u2019s origin. That far-fetched timeline. As long as he investigates a little, he will know everything.What would happen if Qu Moyu knew that Qiuqiu was his child?Shen Dai didn\u2019t dare to think or predict. Staying away from Qu Moyu and isolating him and his children from any harm was the only thing he had to do.Later in the day, Shen Dai received a call from Liu Xi and he intuited that the call was related to the meeting in the morning.Sure enough, Liu Xi said hesitantly, \u201cAh Dai, does Xiao Qu know you\u2019re here?\u201dShen Dai thought to himself; More than knowing since he followed you to my house last night. But he couldn\u2019t say it for the time being. Saying it would not solve any problems, but would make the teacher blame himself so he asked instead, \u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d\u201cWe had an internal meeting this morning. He picked on the lateness and made it a little unpleasant. In the evening, he invited me to dinner alone, saying that he wanted to communicate with me probably to make up for it. As a result, during the meal, he asked me about you.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s breath stagnated: \u201cWhat did he ask about?\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t ask things clearly but it\u2019s about whether you should keep your position or not. He was obviously trying to test me.\u201dShen Dai said in a low voice, \u201cTeacher, I\u2019ve caused you trouble.\u201d\u201cNo. Even if he knows that I help you settle here, he won\u2019t do anything to me. But you have to be careful. Qiuqiu is an illegitimate child and for a family like them, it is a hidden danger and involves a lot of interests.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I understand.\u201dThis phone call made Shen Dai unable to sleep well all night. For him, the best choice now is to stay and work in the research institute in Lancheng, but the sudden appearance of Qu Moyu makes this road impossible. On the one hand, he wanted to give Qiuqiu a stable life. And furthermore, he always cared about his grandmother. Maybe he should go back to the capital and find a new job.The cooperation between Xingzhou and Longke was officially signed. On Monday, most of the people in the research institute were pulled by bus to the mining area more than 60 kilometres away to participate in the ribbon-cutting ceremony.Bai Xiangwan sent Shen Dai some photos of the scene and his words were full of complacency. This was an important achievement in his career and he was full of hope for the future of the project.In the photo, Qu Moyu inevitably appeared. But Shen Dai tried to ignore it and sincerely congratulated Bai Xiangwan.Bai Xiangwan suddenly made a voice call.The phone was connected. It was quiet on the other end and Bai Xiangwan\u2019s voice was a little tired: \u201cI got up at five or six in the morning. The meeting is finally over. I\u2019m in the lounge.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so busy.\u201d Shen Dai said with a smile, \u201cIt may be even busier once the project starts.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be busy about. It\u2019s a waste of time to hold such a useless conference.\u201d Bai Xiangwan yawned, \u201cI\u2019ve been in reception for the past few days and I didn\u2019t get to see you\u2026 and Qiuqiu. How is Qiuqiu? Is he still awake?\u201d\u201cMuch better. Your pheromone essential oils are useful.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good. The mining area is a bit far from the city. We will be staying here at night. Xiao Die\u2019s phone is out of power. She asked me to tell you just now.\u201d\u201cOkay, let\u2019s celebrate when you come back. And congratulations again, senior brother.\u201d\u201cI hope you will participate in this project. I have also talked with the teacher. When the time is right, I will deal with your transfer.\u201dShen Dai was silent for two seconds, then said in a low voice, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll talk about it when I\u2019m ready.\u201dXiao Die didn\u2019t come back today and Qiuqiu was rarely very good. He fell asleep after nine o\u2019clock. This personal time was hard-won, so Shen Dai started to organise and update his resume.It was almost eleven o\u2019clock when Shen Dai was also sleepy. He took a shower and was about to go to bed when the doorbell rang suddenly.Shen Dai\u2019s heart jumped quickly with the rhythm of the doorbell. It\u2019s so late, who will come? He\u2019s afraid if it\u2019s\u2026He jumped out of bed and wandered nervously around the bedroom door a few times. He had a hunch in his heart and he didn\u2019t even want to see who was outside. But letting the doorbell ring like this would wake Qiuqiu. In desperation, he had to walk over. Through the door\u2019s peephole, he saw Qu Moyu standing outside the door.In the dim corridor and the twisted image from the peephole, the tall man wrapped in the black coat clearly set off the atmosphere of a thriller. At least for Shen Dai, the appearance of Qu Moyu was enough for him to panic. He turned around and pressed his back against the door. He breathes evenly.The doorbell also stopped ringing.The two stood tacitly separated by a door and waited quietly.After a long time, Qu Moyu\u2019s voice sounded: \u201cOpen the door. I don\u2019t want to disturb the neighbourhood.\u201dShen Dai said calmly: \u201cYou promise me that you won\u2019t scare my child again.\u201dQu Moyu clenched his fist and said solemnly, \u201cI won\u2019t. I just want to talk to you.\u201dShen Dai had no choice but to open the door.Qu Moyu came and stepped inside uninvited as sturdily as last time. His clothes were slightly covered in dust. The cold air of an early spring night between his clothes made Shen Dai shiver.Shen Dai stood on guard, watching Qu Moyu take off his coat and throw it on the sofa. He then sat down, as if this was his own house.\u201cSit.\u201d Qu Moyu gestured to the single sofa beside him with his chin.Shen Dai\u2019s scalp was numb. He walked over slowly and sat down.Qu Moyu put a document folder in his hand on the coffee table. The emotions on his face can\u2019t be read. His tone was calm, but those dark, deep, bottomless pupils stared straight at Shen Dai. Just him leaning forward gave Shen Dai a fear of being stalked by a beast.Qu Moyu motioned for Shen Dai to look at the document folder with his eyes.Shen Dai picked up the document folder and slowly pulled out the documents inside. When the word \u2018Shen Yue\u2019 appeared in his sight, Shen Dai felt his blood coagulate and his movements froze.Shen Yue is Qiuqiu\u2019s given name.\u201cI checked his date of birth. He is my son. If you don\u2019t admit it, we\u2019ll do a paternity test.\u201d Qu Moyu raised his jaw slightly, without any hint of anger. He created a kind of crossbow arrow that was hidden. He didn\u2019t even realise that in the field of non-fatality, it was his usual attitude at the negotiating table, he said calmly, \u201cYou owe me a lot of explanations.\u201d\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.06.27\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: I think Senior Brother Bai likes SD.

Sometimes he couldn\u2019t understand why the person who saved him pushed him off the cliff with his own hands.Now the answer doesn\u2019t matter anymore. This time, he got up on his own without needing anyone\u2019s hands.Shen Dai said calmly, \u201cWhat is there for me to explain?\u201dQu Moyu was slightly startled. He had a lot of things to say, but he didn\u2019t know which one to say first. When he calmed down from his anger, he began to suspect this kind of unreasonableness, so he easily found the child\u2019s birth file. The 36-weeks premature birth could only mean that it\u2019s his.The ecstasy of that moment far outweighed the hidden dangers of an illegitimate child.However, the room was filled with Bai Xiangwan\u2019s pheromones. That is real. The child is his. It does not mean that Shen Dai has not betrayed him and reason also forced him to start to be vigilant about the purpose of Shen Dai\u2019s actions.The secret that Shen Dai wanted to hide the most was revealed. It was like a jar had fallen and broke. The child was born. What could Qu Moyu do to them?Qu Moyu narrowed his eyes: \u201cYou have breached the contract.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Shen Yue\u2019s guardian. I don\u2019t agree to do a paternity test. Even if you force it on me, it will have no legal effect.\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s eyes were heavy, but he was firm, \u201cMy child has nothing to do with you.\u201dQu Moyu said coldly, \u201cWhich one are you playing at? I don\u2019t know how you kept this child. You\u2019ve worked so hard, tell me, what is it that you want?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want anything. I want nothing.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of tricks like this before.\u201d Qu Moyu sneered, \u201cPeople don\u2019t seek small profits. But they must have a greater plan. You think clearly. An illegitimate child can bring you a limited amount of profits. I\u2019m willing to compensate you now like this. You just take it.\u201dShen Dai also smiled. He was not surprised by Qu Moyu\u2019s speech at all. When he smashed the halo around Qu Moyu with his own flesh and blood, what he saw was an emotionless power machine. In the world of S-class alpha, all kinds of things in the world are only for profit. It was as if a person who does something, there is always a hidden motive for profit. That is what can be understood by Qu Moyu.How can such a pitiful person exist?Shen Dai looked at Qu Moyu indifferently: \u201cI don\u2019t want anything. This child will never have anything to do with you. He won\u2019t need you to give him a penny. You have a legal department. You can afford the best lawyer, you should know. He can\u2019t threaten you and your future legitimate children. So you have nothing to worry about.\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s pupils tightened. He stared at Shen Dai\u2019s expressions, trying to read out some emotions that could help him analyse. But he couldn\u2019t see any hidden trace of anything. Every word Shen Dai said was firm.He didn\u2019t believe that this omega gave birth to his child but would want nothing. He waited for Shen Dai to ask him for a long series of numbers. He would agree, as compensation for washing off the \u2018mark\u2019 and giving birth to the child. And then, he can take the child back with him and he will take care of them for the rest of their lives. Even if Shen Dai had already followed other alphas and let his son get pheromones from other alphas, he would definitely grab them back.Shen Dai looked at the time: \u201cMr. Qu, it\u2019s very late, you\u2026\u201d\u201cShen Dai.\u201d Qu Moyu increased his tone, \u201cDon\u2019t play coy with me.\u201dShen Dai shook his head: \u201cHow can you be rest-assured? I can sign a non-disclosure agreement with you. If I go back and cause damage to your reputation or property, you can write as much compensation as you want.\u201dQu Moyu stared blankly at Shen Dai. He couldn\u2019t believe nor accept that Shen Dai really didn\u2019t ask him for anything and that he didn\u2019t need anything from him. For an omega to risk giving birth to his child like this, the money and the name must always be the motive. Otherwise, what will it be?Could it be that it was because of Bai Xiangwan?Qu Moyu was driven by jealousy, and he gritted his teeth as he said, \u201cIs it because of Bai Xiangwan? You want to stay here just for him? How could he be willing to be with an omega who has been divorced and washed off a \u2018mark\u2019? Or does he simply just like to raise the sons of others?\u201dShen Dai\u2019s lips trembled. In the face of Qu Moyu\u2019s repeated humiliation, he had no resistance at all. He could only use indifference as the last weapon. He whispered, \u201cIt has nothing to do with you. Get out.\u201d\u201cMy son is sleeping in that room. You are my omega. It has nothing to do with me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not your omega!\u201d Shen Dai roared, \u201cQiuqiu is just my son. We will never have anything to do with you again in this life!\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s complexion changed over and over, His heart felt like it was filled with smoke and the suffocation of his ventricle made him extremely uncomfortable.Shen Dai stood up and said in a trembling voice: \u201cYou are right. Bai Xiangwan will not want an omega who has been divorced and washed off a \u2018mark\u2019. We are not in that kind of relationship. You don\u2019t have to deliberately embarrass him. Now you should go. \u201c\u201cThe room is full of his pheromones, including your bedroom, including my son. Do you think I\u2019ll believe it?\u201d\u201cWhether you believe it or not, get out.\u201dQu Moyu stresses his words as he said, \u201cShen Dai, don\u2019t regret it.\u201dShen Dai walked over and opened the door. He looked at Qu Moyu with only resentment and hostility in his eyes.Qu Moyu couldn\u2019t find a reason not to leave because of his crushed self-esteem. He had never been treated like this before. Even though he repeatedly lowered the bottom line for this person and even made promises to him, how could this person be so ignorant? How could this person dare to do this to him?!Qu Moyu strode to the door. But when he passed by Shen Dai, he smelled the long-lost fragrance of flowers and his body could no longer move.That day, he visited to confirm whether Shen Dai was marked or not, but he couldn\u2019t smell the pheromones that kept him up at night. During this year, he had suppressed the longing for the short-lived fragrance. Every time he thinks of the seductive fragrance that turned from light to thick during the estrus period, a little bit of his memories of making love with Shen Dai emerges in my mind.He thought that this emotion would pass. That it was just a physiological desire transformed into a courtship impulse. He did not allow himself to indulge in low-level needs.However, after a year, he couldn\u2019t make it through.Qu Moyu grabbed the door handle and closed it with a bang. Before Shen Dai could react, he was already pressed against the wall by Qu Moyu. The rude kiss fell on him and he was blocked in between the door and the man. Qu Moyu kissed Shen Dai\u2019s lips rudely, grinding and sucking hard.At the moment when he finally tasted it again, Qu Moyu realised that he missed the taste more than he thought. And all the impulses erupted in his pants.\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026\u201d Shen Dai couldn\u2019t even utter a complete cry for help. He was kissed by Qu Moyu so breathlessly that his hypoxic brain was spinning around in a daze. And when he recovered, he was already overpowered on the sofa.Qu Moyu\u2019s big hand felt the smooth texture of Shen Dai\u2019s sin inch by inch, excited by the familiar touch, and he was shaken by the apparent weight loss.\u201cLet go of me!\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s face turned red and also pale. His eyes were full of fear and shame. Why did Qu Moyu treat him like this? Why did he hurt him again and again?!Qu Moyu\u2019s legs pushed against Shen Dai\u2019s knees, forcing him to spread his legs for himself. His mind was dazed by jealousy and could only shout at random: \u201cYou said you like me. But you turned your head while carrying my child. If you become lovers with other alphas, will one day my son call him Dad?!\u201d\u201cQu Moyu!\u201d Shen Dai cried, \u201cYou bastard! I don\u2019t like you. I hate you!\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s eyes were red. The manic alpha pheromone in his body was about to be overwhelmed. He just wanted to swallow the life under him. There was a voice in his mind screaming for him to invade, attack, conquer, and completely possess this person. Only his prey can soothe his uneasiness. He stripped off Shen Dai\u2019s clothes and forced the omega, who made him feel unspeakable pain, to sacrifice himself to him.That was until Qu Moyu saw the scar on Shen Dai\u2019s abdomen \u2013 the scar left by caesarean section.Shen Dai\u2019s lower abdomen used to be like a thin and flawless white wall. He has a thin waist that he could wrap around with only one arm. Three months after giving birth, it has not fully recovered its elasticity and the pale pink scar is slightly undulating. It looks even more dazzling.Qu Moyu\u2019s heart was hit hard and he stopped all movements.Shen Dai curled up his naked body, hugged himself tightly, trembling violently, wishing he could just disappear.Looking at Shen Dai like this, Qu Moyu suddenly didn\u2019t know what he had done. He stiffly took off his suit jacket and carefully covered it on Shen Dai\u2019s body.At this moment, the baby\u2019s cry broke through the barrier created by the two of them. The sound entered the eardrum and pulled Shen Dai back to reality from the cave of his self-protection.Shen Dai, wrapped in Qu Moyu\u2019s clothes, got up tremblingly. He stumbled into the bedroom.He didn\u2019t know when Qiuqiu started crying. His face was flushed red. Shen Dai\u2019s hands and feet were still shaking.Qu Moyu walked in. Shen Dai\u2019s body looked thinner under his suit and the trembling back made his heart tighten. Just as he was about to say something, Qiuqiu\u2019s cry suddenly rose and became sharper.Shen Dai turned his head. His pupils darkened: \u201cGet out. He\u2019s afraid of you.\u201dThe hatred in Shen Dai\u2019s eyes and the tears on his face made Qu Moyu\u2019s spine go cold. Any difficulty he encountered in his life, the excitement of the challenge will always outweigh the anxiety. Only this time it was different. He did not dare to face Shen Dai. With Shen Dai\u2019s accusing eyes, he felt at a loss.In the end, he could only flee.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.06.28\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s Note: It was so satisfying to read this chapter.

As soon as Qiuqiu smelled the warm white elm pheromone, he was well-behaved and happy. He bent his eyes and giggled. He waved his little hands excitedly and said something incomprehensible from his mouth.Bai Xiangwan teased Qiuqiu for a while and when he saw Shen Dai sitting beside him, looking at their direction with unfocused eyes, he was stunned. He stretched out his hand and shook it in front of Shen Dai\u2019s eyes, and said softly, \u201cWhat happened last night? Did you not sleep?\u201dShen Dai came back to his senses. He yawned and smiled bitterly: \u201cAs usual.\u201d\u201cHave you found any night shift nanny?\u201d\u201cThe agency has suggested three for me. I plan to go for an interview today.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good to have a nanny. You can\u2019t endure like this. It hurts your body too much.\u201dShen Dai nodded: \u201cJust wait until I find one.

It\u2019s time for you to mature. Don\u2019t keep troubling your father.\u201dShen Dai smiled: \u201cThanks to your pheromone, Qiuqiu is much better than before.\u201dBai Xiangwan stared at Qiuqiu. His bright eyes flickering, as if he was hesitating to say something. After a long time, he said, \u201cIs his alpha father\u2019s pheromone useful?\u201dShen Dai was startled.Bai Xiangwan turned his head to look at Shen Dai. His eyes were calm and peaceful. There was no questioning, no curiosity, and no prying eyes. He spoke naturally as if they were talking about professional topics: \u201cI smelled it as soon as I entered the room. It\u2019s Qu Moyu\u2019s.\u201dAlthough Bai Xiangwan\u2019s expression and way of asking questions were already very respectful, Shen Dai lowered his head in embarrassment.\u201cI guessed it a long time ago. I\u2019ve heard some\u2026 Well, this time he came so I am sure.\u201d\u201cSenior brother, I\u2019m sorry for causing trouble for you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Bai Xiangwan shrugged, \u201cHe\u2019s the boss. He said a few words to me for the sake of money. It doesn\u2019t matter. He still has to hand over this project to me.\u201dShen Dai said in a low voice, \u201cI don\u2019t want Qiuqiu to get involved with him. Qiuqiu also rejects his pheromones.\u201d\u201cWhat about him?\u201dShen Dai pondered for a moment and said, \u201cWe are already over. He is already engaged.\u201dBai Xiangwan doesn\u2019t think so. He is also an alpha. He may not agree with some alphas\u2019 behaviours, but he can understand that Qu Moyu came to the door on purpose. And he had so much hostility to himself, which shows that in Qu Moyu\u2019s heart, the two of them are not over yet. But looking at Shen Dai\u2019s dark circles under his eyes and the tiredness on his face, he was also very depressed. He didn\u2019t know what to say. After thinking about it for a while, he said, \u201cDo you have any plans for the future?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to get a job, I\u2019ve already started looking.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t look for one. You go back and properly resign. And then come to work with me.\u201dShen Dai looked at Bai Xiangwan and hesitated.\u201cAre you worried that Qu Moyu will embarrass you and me?\u201d\u201cSenior brother, you have helped me a lot. There is no need to be implicated by me for this kind of thing.\u201d\u201cThe word \u2018implicated\u2019 is too serious. I think you are overthinking it. Qu Moyu is the executive president of the group. He is very cheap to embarrass you as a small employee. The branch in Lancheng is independently operated. He can\u2019t control our personnel appointments and dismissals and he won\u2019t be able to mess with me because of this.\u201d Bai Xiangwan blinked, \u201cI make him so much money every year.\u201dHow Qu Moyu would embarrass himself, Shen Dai really couldn\u2019t imagine. Every time the conflict between the two deepened, he would see the darker and worse side of Qu Moyu. But he thinks Bai Xiangwan\u2019s confidence is justified. The mining area in Lancheng is currently the main profit point of the group. Bai Xiangwan is still holding such a large project. Although the employment relationship is a two-way choice, there are no other employees compatible with Bai Xiangwan. This kind of high-end talent has truly achieved the best. In fact, the company is afraid of Bai Xiangwan\u2019s job hopping and there is no possibility that Bai Xiangwan will be messed with.Shen Dai admires Bai Xiangwan very much. If the teacher is the ultimate goal of his struggle, then, Bai Xiangwan is his current stage goal.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Seeing that Shen Dai was shaken, Bai Xiangwan warmly advised. \u201cIf you take the initiative to resign, you will lose a little compensation and options at most. Come to me, I will give you good treatment. And I will also give you a lot of money and broad development space. You are the talent I need.\u201dShen Dai looked at Bai Xiangwan gratefully: \u201cSenior brother, what you said means a lot to me. I never wanted to be treated differently because of gender. When I decided to stay with Qiuqiu, I also made a choice to go back to work someday. For a few years, I even started from scratch, but I didn\u2019t expect this to be more difficult than I thought. This year, if I didn\u2019t insist on finishing the thesis, I really felt like I was going to be scrapped.\u201d He smiled wryly. After a while, in retrospect, this may have been the most painful, tiring, lowest, and anxious time in his life. \u201cYou think I am useful and give me a lot of encouragement.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s normal for you to feel depressed now. What you\u2019ve been through is really not easy. But I believe you will recover. And you seem to be ready for that soon.\u201d Bai Xiangwan\u2019s eyes were sincere and powerful, \u201cCome and work for me.\u201dShen Dai had originally planned to go back to the capital to find a job. First, he was concerned about his grandma, which was his family after all. Second, there were more jobs and higher wages there, but Bai Xiangwan\u2019s simple words made him change his mind.By staying here, he can stay far away from Qu Moyu. And away from the person who hurt him, humiliated him, and plundered over him.Shen Dai\u2019s eyes became firm: \u201cSenior brother, give me some time. I will go back and handle the resignation. And then I want to take my grandma here and after all the processing is done, I will go to work. I will not let you down.\u201dBai Xiangwan looked at him with a smile and gentle eyes: \u201cI believe in you.\u201dQu Moyu was sitting in his private jet. The safety preparations before taking off were done and he just waited for the jet to move. He held his cheeks and looked out the window seemingly motionless. But in fact, his ears were listening to the video call between Yan Mingxiu and his wife. Yan Mingxiu was sitting opposite of him.\u201cWell, it will take off in a while. I may be home around the same time as you.\u201d\u201cI bought all the specialties, enough for you to share.\u201d\u201cDo you still want to film in the mining area? Do you know how bad the exposure is and how bad the environment is? Don\u2019t think about challenging yourself all day long.\u201d Although Yan Mingxiu\u2019s tone was reproaching, there was still a gentle smile in his eyes.The two didn\u2019t chat for too long. The conversation was very normal but Qu Moyu frequently took a look from the corner of his eye.After hanging up the phone, Yan Mingxiu took off the Bluetooth headset and looked at his watch: \u201cCan we get there at about four o\u2019clock?\u201d\u201cWell, around that time.\u201d Qu Moyu teased, \u201cSo loving. Do you have to chat with each other every day?\u201d He has seen several Zhou Xiang movies and he has also met Zhou Xiang twice at parties. With various personalities deduced, the actor in reality is very easy-going and at first glance, he is a person with high emotional intelligence and good temper.Yan Mingxiu smiled: \u201cMore or less. I often travel for business and he often shoots in different places.\u201dQu Moyu never inquired about other people\u2019s privacy, not only because of politeness, but also because he was not interested. But at this time he couldn\u2019t help and curiously asked: \u201cMingxiu, when you married him, you\u2026 don\u2019t you worry? He is a beta that cannot be marked.\u201d How many temptations for an S-class alpha to face in his life. Only \u2018marking\u2019 is the most likely constraint to make them loyal.\u201cBefore I met him, I would have the same questions as you. After meeting him, I felt that these were not problems at all.\u201d Yan Mingxiu\u2019s expression was very calm. Obviously, this was not the first time for him to answer such a question. And every time he answered them, he also sincerely believed in these words.Qu Moyu\u2019s heart is full of mixed feelings. Why can Yan Mingxiu marry a beta, but he can\u2019t even handle an omega he has \u2018marked\u2019? He had never experienced such setbacks before.In his mind was Shen Dai\u2019s face full of resentment, fear, and tears. Under the influence of their recent meetings, Shen Dai\u2019s resistance to him was infinitely magnified. And he could not even remember what Shen Dai looked like back when his beautiful face was full of admiration, dependence, and joy.Shen Dai personally said that he liked him but he also said that he hated him completely. The thought of this made Qu Moyu\u2019s heart aching.Shen Dai has already spoken to this point. He also did stupid things that he didn\u2019t even condoned under those stimuli. It was so ugly. It affected his mentality, words and deeds. Shen Dai was so ignorant of what is good and bad for him. Why does he have to be with someone else!At this time, the flight attendant came over with two glasses of soda water, put his knees on the coffee table between them, and said respectfully, \u201cMr. Qu, Mr. Yan, the plane will take off soon and it is expected to land at our destination at 4:15 a.m.\u201dQu Moyu came back to his senses: \u201cOkay, pour me a glass of mineral water. Thank you.\u201dThe flight attendant exchanged another glass of mineral water.Qu Moyu took out a medicine bottle and took two pills with water.Yan Mingxiu looked at the familiar medicine bottle and frowned, \u201cThis is a medicine that delays the susceptible period, right? This medicine is very powerful.\u201dQu Moyu said lightly, \u201cIs there anything wrong with it?\u201d\u201cThe signing ceremony of our project can be postponed. Anyway, it has been decided. Why do you need to take such medicines that hurt your body?\u201d Yan Mingxiu swept Qu Moyu up and down with his deep eyes and finally understood why they had not seen each other for a few days. He was noticeably thinner in the end.\u201cI didn\u2019t eat much. I\u2019ll just go home.\u201d Qu Moyu smiled lightly, \u201cThe schedule has been arranged.\u201dHe wouldn\u2019t tell anyone that he delayed the susceptible period because of fear. The susceptible period is not easy. As an alpha, he should have gotten used to it. But this time is different from the past. Over the past year, his desire for a person has never stopped. Entering the susceptible period will only expand this desire.It doesn\u2019t matter. A person\u2019s life is a battle against desire. He doesn\u2019t believe that he will be manipulated by a mere omega. He likes Shen Dai, but it doesn\u2019t matter. If he can\u2019t even let go of this cumbersome relationship, he\u2019s not worthy to be an S-class alpha.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.06.29\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: Why does Bai Xiangwan job offer sound like a proposal to me?

Lao Wu picked him up at the airport and sent him to this family house where the things he needed to get through the susceptible period were in the trunk.In the past year, Qu Moyu seldom went home. No matter how busy he was, he would go back to eat one or two meals with his parents every month, but since Mrs. Qu sent Shen Dai away, he had been avoiding his mother.After getting out of the car, from the moment he saw the old housekeeper in the house, he felt that the atmosphere was not right. He glanced at the housekeeper with inquiring eyes, and the housekeeper looked a little helpless.Entering the room, Qu Moyu saw Zhou Xiaochu was sitting on the sofa in the living room chatting with his parents. He immediately furrowed his eyebrows.\u201cBrother Yu.\u201d Zhou Xiaochu stood up and looked at Qu Moyu with a smile, \u201cYou just got off the plane. Me too. Are you tired?\u201d\u201cYou are not on a holiday recently. Why are you back?\u201d Qu Moyu nodded to his parents, then looked at Zhou Xiaochu calmly.Zhou Xiaochu is studying art abroad. He hasn\u2019t graduated yet. Spring break was over for him long ago. At this time, he should be at school, not at his home.Zhou Xiaochu said generously: \u201cDidn\u2019t you about to reach the susceptible period? I came back to accompany you.\u201dQu Shen picked up the teacup and took a sip, looking at his son expressionlessly. Meanwhile, Mrs. Qu silently stroked the hand-embroidery on the hem of her clothes. The close-knit and ingenious design looks elegant and better the closer you look.\u201cIt\u2019s not the time yet.\u201d Qu Moyu said, \u201cXiaochu, you\u2019re still studying. So you shouldn\u2019t ask for leave casually. You take a night\u2019s rest and I\u2019ll send you back tomorrow.\u201dZhou Xiaochu said without changing his face: \u201cBrother Yu, I\u2019m your fianc\u00e9e. It\u2019s what I should do to accompany you through the susceptible period. This is more important than studying.\u201d He gently took Qu Moyu\u2019s hand and said softly, \u201cWe are going to be together for a lifetime. Can\u2019t you trust me?\u201dQu Moyu stared at his fianc\u00e9e with unspeakable irritability pouring into his heart. He knew that Zhou Xiaochu had done nothing wrong. He had always been gentle and decent. They are top matched. And he is a very satisfied and impeccable wife candidate.But he just\u2026 he is getting more and more resistant.He patiently said softly, \u201cXiaochu, my susceptibility period hasn\u2019t come yet. And we haven\u2019t gotten married yet. A hasty decision is irresponsible of you. And I won\u2019t be able to explain it to your parents.\u201dQu Shen said: \u201cXiaochu, you two have just arrived home and are tired. Let\u2019s arrange for you to go to the guest room to rest.\u201dAlthough Zhou Xiaochu was disappointed, he didn\u2019t reveal any emotions. So he went down the steps: \u201cOkay, then I\u2019ll trouble you, uncle.\u201dThe housekeeper carried Zhou Xiaochu\u2019s luggage and sent him to the guest room.After the outsider left, the three members of the Qu family stared at each other with wide eyes.Qu Shen coughed softly: \u201cSit down.\u201dQu Moyu sat down with his eyes down. In fact, he didn\u2019t want to say a word, and he didn\u2019t want to face any questions from his parents.\u201cIs everything going well in Lancheng?\u201dHearing Lancheng, Mrs. Qu\u2019s heart trembled slightly.\u201cEverything was smooth. The construction has started and the prospects are promising.\u201dQu Shen nodded: \u201cThis project has been implemented and the company is basically stable. This financing from Zhou Jiaqiahe is very important and has helped us a lot.\u201dQu Moyu realised what Qu Shen was going to say.\u201dXiaochu is a good kid, he is worthy of you in every way, and he is smart and sensible.\u201d Qu Shen looked at Qu Moyu, \u201cWhen he graduates, you two get married. You can also give him the \u2018mark\u2019. Take this into account.\u201dQu Moyu narrowed his eyes slightly and said solemnly, \u201cI won\u2019t \u2018mark\u2019 anyone.\u201d\u201cYou have already \u2018marked\u2019 someone before.\u201d Qu Shen sarcastically said.\u201cThat was schemed by Qu Chengchen.\u201d Thinking of this, Qu Moyu was full of resentment.\u201cThat\u2019s because you were not careful enough to let an omega who was just in a contract relationship with you intervene too much in your life. Otherwise, would Qu Chengchen have a chance to plot against you?\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s face became more and more gloomy.\u201cQu Chengchen brought this matter to the Zhou family. I asked the old man to calm down. Wouldn\u2019t it not make sense if you didn\u2019t \u2018mark\u2019 Xiaochu? Now you can use the excuse of not getting married. Once you are married, just settle down.\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s tone became stiff: \u201cFather, this is the only thing I can\u2019t agree to. I don\u2019t want to be controlled by anyone.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Mrs. Qu interrupted their conversation. \u201cMo Yu just got off the plane. After so many days of work, he must be tired. Let him rest first. If there is anything else, we can talk about it tomorrow.\u201dQu Shen said with a sullen face: \u201cHow many more days are there until the susceptible period? If you are not sure, go directly to the safe house.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Qu Moyu stood up, \u201cI\u2019ll go back to my room first.\u201dThe reason why he returned to the family house with his luggage was because his safe house was here and the medication plan customised by his personal doctor had delayed the susceptible period by almost half a month for him to enter the susceptible period. He plans to go back to his room to take a shower and get ready.After Qu Moyu took a shower, the housekeeper had already delivered the luggage to his room and his mother was waiting in the room.Mrs. Qu looked at her son and then at the three suitcases: \u201cThe safe house is ready. I\u2019ll help you pack these things in a while.\u201d\u201cNo need. Let the housekeepers do it.\u201d Qu Moyu poured himself a glass of whisky, sat on the sofa in front of the bed and quietly looked at the newly-bloomed peach branches outside the window.The half-dry hair fell on his forehead, blocking his eyes and blocking most of his thoughts. Mrs. Qu always felt a sense of distance between herself and her son. At this time, this feeling was even worse. He seemed so far away and couldn\u2019t be touched.Mrs. Qu hesitated.\u201cMother, are you trying to persuade me about Xiaochu or do you want to inquire about Shen Dai?\u201d Qu Moyu slowly turned his head, his eyes were even more unpredictable in the dim light.Mrs. Qu\u2019s breath stagnated and whispered, \u201cYou have seen him.\u201dShe felt that when Qu Moyu went to Lancheng this time, it was mostly because he had found out the whereabouts of Shen Dai. In fact, as long as Qu Moyu thought about it, it was not very difficult for him to find him. In the information age, it is almost impossible for a person to completely erase his trace.In the year that Shen Dai left, Qu Moyu acted as if everything was business as usual. His dissatisfaction with her was not beyond words. It was just an excuse to be busy and seldom went home again. But she still felt that it might just be a feeling between mother and son. \u2013 She felt that her son was sinking.From the few words of the people around her, she knew that Mr. Qu at the company became more irritated than before and the young master at home became more distant than before.Qu Moyu shook the wine glass, the ice cubes hit the wall of the glass making clinking sound. It was like a heartbeat flowing in the river of time. He remembered the two meetings he had with Shen Dai in Lancheng. They were too bad, too chaotic, and too ugly. He couldn\u2019t even find too many words to describe it so he just said: \u201cI saw him.\u201d\u201cHis\u2026 Um, is he doing well?\u201d Mrs. Qu wanted to tell from Qu Moyu\u2019s expression whether he knew about the existence of the child or not.Qu Moyu\u2019s thoughts were clear in Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes: \u201cHe\u2019s not well.\u201d An omega who has no money, no power and no relatives, how can he be well to have a child and raise a child alone in another place? At a glance, he felt that his omega should not live in such a small house with a tired face and live a life of embarrassment. He wanted to give Shen Dai a good life. He always wanted to. But Shen Dai didn\u2019t want it. Why doesn\u2019t he want it?Mrs. Qu\u2019s complexion quickly darkened. Her lips trembled slightly, as if she had a lot to say.\u201cHe gave birth to an alpha boy. You want to ask this, right?\u201dMrs. Qu suddenly raised her head and stared at Qu Moyu in a daze. Her eyes slowly turned red. In fact, she was always worried about whether the child was born or not. After experiencing such torture, the child may not be able to be saved, but Shen Dai really gave birth to the child. And really did what ordinary people couldn\u2019t do. She couldn\u2019t do it either.\u201cHe washed off the \u2018mark\u2019. How did he save the child?\u201d Qu Moyu couldn\u2019t figure this out. The only possibility was some medical technology that he didn\u2019t understand yet, \u201cYou helped him.\u201dMrs. Qu\u2019s heart was suffocated. She knew too much what price Shen Dai had paid to keep the child, but she promised Shen Dai that she would not tell anyone. She would always remember what Shen Dai said to herself before the operation. Those very words embedded in her.Shen Dai had smiled and said, \u201cNo matter how this kid makes me angry in the future or doesn\u2019t grow up as I expected, I won\u2019t use this incident to blame him for a sense of guilt. Because it\u2019s my own choice. Let this matter be a secret between us, please don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201cMrs. Qu took a deep breath: \u201cThat child. Is he okay? Is he healthy?\u201d\u201cHe cried a lot. When he cried, it was so loud.\u201d Qu Moyu laughed suddenly, but the smile disappeared quickly. He didn\u2019t seem to have seen the child seriously and now he regrets it. He should take a good look at it. Looking at his and Shen Dai\u2019s child, \u201cHe should be healthy.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What is his name?\u201d\u201cShen Yue.\u201d\u201cShen Yue. Shen Yue. It sounds so nice.\u201d Mrs. Qu repeated the name. \u201cWhat about the pheromone level?\u201d She had an idea. An idea that was too ideal, but if, in case, Shen Dai was lucky by giving birth to an S-level alpha, can all the contradictions be resolved? And will there be a happy ending?Qu Moyu shook his head: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dHe has no intention of knowing Shen Yue\u2019s pheromone level at all. It is very unlikely that a B-level omega can give birth to an S-level alpha. And Shen Dai didn\u2019t say anything. Anyone who has an S-level alpha will definitely announce it to the world. So he never thought about this issue from beginning to end, because he defaulted that Shen Yue was at most A-level.Mrs. Qu also thought the same way, so she didn\u2019t ask any further. She sighed: \u201cNo matter what, Shen Dai didn\u2019t cause you any trouble when the child was born. If he needs money\u2026\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need it.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s fingers holding the wine glass tightened, and his knuckles turned blue and white. He stared at his mother and said coldly, \u201cAre you satisfied with the result?\u201dMrs. Qu slowly lowered her head. And after a long time, she said in a hoarse voice, \u201cIn mom\u2019s life\u2026 There are many, many things that I regret. But I don\u2019t regret this one.\u201d She stood up gracefully and walked away.Qu Moyu was silent in the darkness as he slumped in the chair motionlessly. It was as if he would blend in with the darkness at any time. After an unknown amount of time, he smashed the wine glass in his hand to the ground.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.06.30\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: Why are all the parents in this story full of shits???? -KPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He thought about leaving Qiuqiu in Lancheng and coming back to run errands by himself. After all, it is not convenient for such a young child to board a plane. But firstly, grandma really wanted to see Qiuqiu. And secondly, he would worry about leaving Qiuqiu.During the two-hour flight, Qiuqiu cried for about half of the journey. This was probably the most embarrassing moment in Shen Dai\u2019s life. He could clearly hear the impatient smacking sounds and the condemning gazes projected from the passengers around him. The volume of the cries was so loud that he could just hear people complaining, \u201cWhat kind of plane allows such a small child to take?\u201d. In the past, when he was on public transportation, he was most afraid of being next to noisy children. He could fully understand the irritability of those people, but when he changed his position, he felt helpless and ashamed. Every second was like sitting on pins and needles.After finally reaching the destination, without the influence of the pressure difference on the plane, Qiuqiu, who was tired from crying, soon fell asleep.Sitting in the taxi, Shen Dai looked at the sleeping Qiuqiu. His eyelids were red and swollen, his eyelashes were wet, his nose was flushed red, and his small mouth opened and closed slightly with his breathing. He thought to himself, such a small child, how can he have the strength to cry for so long? Shen Dai gently caressed Qiuqiu\u2019s face with his fingers and sighed.Then, the driver\u2019s words made Shen Dai even more uncomfortable. He said, \u201cThis child is only a few months old, right? Are you an omega alone taking care of him?\u201dShen Dai met the driver\u2019s sympathetic gaze from the rearview mirror. He gave a faint \u201cum\u201d and looked out the window.Shen Dai stayed in a hotel very close to his home. Not long after he checked in, his grandmother arrived. At her age, she wasn\u2019t in a good condition and it was not easy for her to go out by herself. When the two met, their eyes were red and his grandmother couldn\u2019t help crying while hugging Shen Dai.After calming down, his grandmother was immediately attracted to Qiuqiu on the bed. She hugged and kissed him. She liked him so much that she didn\u2019t know what to do. Qiuqiu also had a natural affection for grandma, and his cute and sweet smile could melt anyone\u2019s heart.They talked about what happened this year.During this time, Shen Dai only secretly contacted his grandmother, who also followed his request. She kept Shen Dai\u2019s whereabouts and Qiuqiu\u2019s existence a secret from Shen Qin. After learning from Shen Dai intermittently what Shen Qin did, his grandmother was angry and helpless. But she could not do without the care of her relatives, so she could only try to avoid letting Shen Qin know that Shen Dai gave birth to Qu Moyu\u2019s child. Otherwise, Shen Qin will never let go of this cash cow.When Shen Dai came back this time, he didn\u2019t intend to let Shen Qin know all that. He only had to do two things, one was to proceed with the resignation procedure and the other was to discuss with his grandmother for her to go to Lancheng with him.When it came to the latter, his grandmother unsurprisingly hesitated.Grandma squeezed Qiuqiu\u2019s fleshy little hand and sighed softly, \u201cI can\u2019t take good care of a child with my body and age.\u201dShen Dai hurriedly said: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to take care of him. I have already found a nanny.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll just become your burden.\u201d Grandma looked at Shen Dai with distressed eyes, \u201cYou\u2019re still so young. It\u2019s already difficult to take care of your child alone and then there is another sick old woman. How will you live your life?\u201dShen Dai pretended to smile lightly: \u201cI\u2019m looking for a new job. Although the salary is definitely not as good as the one I had, the salary should be quite high. It was mainly because Lancheng\u2019s consumption is low. The house is owned by a friend and the rent is very cheap. In this way, there is not much pressure.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just about money. You have to be busy with your career and take care of your child. If you add another old woman, you won\u2019t be able to keep up. Ah Dai, you\u2019ve worked hard enough and I can\u2019t trouble you any more.\u201d His grandmother smiled and said, \u201cI have a son. My pension is not your responsibility, but it is his responsibility. You have taken care of grandma for many years. Now you can take care of your own child.\u201dShen Dai looked at his grandmother\u2019s loving expression. His whole heart is clenched. He knew that his grandma was right, but he couldn\u2019t bear to hear it. If it wasn\u2019t for Qiuqiu, his first duty in life was to give his grandmother good care until she dies. He was very firm when he said: \u201cGrandma, I know it\u2019s going to be difficult, but I can take care of you. Back then, when I didn\u2019t have a formal job, I could take care of you, and I can also do it now. Together as a family, we can overcome any difficulties.\u201dHis grandmother shook her head: \u201cAh Dai, you have this intention, Grandma is already content. But I don\u2019t want to continue to drag you down and I don\u2019t want to leave my hometown. I\u2019ve lived here all my life and I plan to die here.\u201d She joked, \u201cIf I go to the northwest, the climate, water and soil are completely different from here and I won\u2019t even know how to grow flowers.\u201dShen Dai looked at his grandmother sadly. Both of them knew in their hearts that if they were separated from each other, the chance of meeting each other in this life would only be in single digits.Shen Dai began to hesitate. Maybe he should come back to find a job here so that he can take care of his grandmother. But being here is too close to Qu Moyu and Lancheng has a ready-made position. So how to choose? He was in a dilemma for a while.Seeing his embarrassment, his grandmother changed the subject and talked about Qiuqiu. She asked very carefully as if to make up for all the missing bits and pieces about her little grandson.***Qu Moyu slowly opened his eyes. The space he was in was very dark, but he still felt that the pressure in his eyes was too high and he felt sore.The body is in an extremely contradictory state \u2013 it was tired and also excited. He didn\u2019t know how to describe it. It was as if the overloaded machine had been replaced with a high-intensity battery causing him to become very tired, but there is an endless release of physical energy.He sat up from the bed and looked at the barren silence around him.This is a large suite with a very strange decoration style. The whole walls are dark blue in colour of the ocean. All the walls are soft-packed. There are no windows. Everything\u2026 including the lighting is built in. The floor is covered with a thick plush carpet and the only thing in the suite that can be called furniture is a large mattress. There was no bed frame. There are some necessities of life, such as food, water, clothes, medicines, etc. which are placed on the ground in the corner of the wall. The other functional areas are the shower room and toilet, which are also minimalist to the extreme, with almost no extra items.Like a doomsday bunker, it is more like a prison cell. This is the safe house that S-class alphas use to spend the susceptible period alone.Safe houses are usually hidden and isolated underground. This is to protect others from being hurt by an S-class alpha. The most calming dark blue decoration and soft bags everywhere are meant to avoid hard objects. So, there are no unnecessary items. It is to protect alpha from accidentally hurting himself in a manic state.At this point, there are signs of damage, such as torn carpets and mattresses. And door panels covered in fist marks and blood.Qu Moyu lowered his head following the pain in his body and saw the two hands that were covered with white gauze that were seeping blood. He remembered what happened before he fell into unconsciousness.At the moment when his desire was at its strongest, his father opened the eight-centimetre-thick alloy door that couldn\u2019t be penetrated by bullets and sent Zhou Xiaochu in. The docile and emaciated omega, his beautiful fianc\u00e9e, released a sweet prune-flavoured pheromone, trying to approach him with fear and anticipation.The omega\u2019s pheromones flooded the entire room, penetrating into the pervasive brain. It was sweet, charming and seductive. It released infinite temptation, but it was not what he wanted.What and who he wants, his body and soul have given clear answers. In the safe house, every minute and every second of the surging hormones is an ascetic practice of endurance. He had gone crazy and thirsty for the taste of the short-lived flowers. The Epiphyllum. But someone dared to invade his territory at this time, that is called provocation.He still had a shred of reason and he restrained himself from jumping up and tearing up the intruder. So he slammed his fists on the door, keeping his mind awake with pain accompanied by beast-like roars in order to warn and intimidate them.The intruder\u2019s screams bored him and his last patience was running out.That door opened again. It was the damn door that stopped him from finding his omega. He rushed over. He was going to leave this place. He was going to find that wisp of Epiphyllum. No one should try to trap him and no one should try to take away his man!Then his father and mother appeared. The only people in the world who are most likely to tame S-level alphas are their parents. Of course, it is not physical tameness, but rather psychological, moral, and genetic instincts. It can outperform pheromone suppression.He watched his father inject him with tranquillisers and he resisted the urge to fight back. He knelt at his mother\u2019s feet and said over and over again: \u201cWhere is Shen Dai? Where is my omega? Give me Shen Dai. Ah Dai!\u201d he begged until he lost consciousness.Shen Dai. Shen Dai. Shen Dai.The name was like a spell, echoing repeatedly in his mind. He held his aching head and rolled from the bed to the ground. The soaring lust and devouring thoughts tormented his every sense and nerve. It was like when the dying person is hungry for food. He wants Shen Dai. And he wants Shen Dai madly.He rolled and crawled to the door and once again used his fists to bombard the obstacle that was preventing him from finding Shen Dai. If he managed to leave this place, he must find his omega immediately. He must immediately smell the lingering fragrance of the Epiphyllum flowers.But there was a very small voice in his heart telling him that he could not find Shen Dai. Nor could he smell the fragrance of the short-lived flowers. Because he had thrown Shen Dai away with his own hands. Shen Dai was far away from him. He had walked out far away from his life. He left his world and never looked back.Despair came overwhelmingly, breaking his heart.His heart ached to the point of death.The door finally opened. Of course, he couldn\u2019t get Shen Dai. He got the blooming short-lived flowers that his parents had searched all over the city and all the personal belongings that Shen Dai had left in his house.He stacked Shen Dai\u2019s clothes and bedding to build a nest, like a child without a home. He huddled in the only nest that could give him a sense of security, taking a little scent of the pheromone belonging to Shen Dai from the washed items.He hugged Shen Dai\u2019s pyjamas and cried non-stop. The scent of the Epiphyllum flowers was too light. It was far less than what he once had. He once had not only his sweet pheromones, but also his thoughtful words, gentle hugs, sweet kisses, and crazy love affairs He was craving like a madman. He murmured: \u201cAh Dai, where are you?\u201dAh Dai, where are you? Why don\u2019t you want to come back to me?Ah Dai, come back to see me. Come to accompany me. I miss you so much. I miss you so much. I miss you so much.Ah Dai, I love you so much. I just want you.Ah Dai, it hurts so much.Ah Dai, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.07.01\u058d\u058d\u058dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But he took a year off due to an \u2018illness\u2019 and his career was hit hard. When he came back again, he was resigning. If he met his former colleagues, he really didn\u2019t know how to deal with the surprised eyes and curious inquiries of his acquaintances.As a former senior brother in the laboratory, he should have invited everyone to a meal. But after thinking about it, he rather kept a low profile.All the documents had been prepared by him and Cheng Zimei accompanied him to the personnel department to go through some procedures. In principle, Liu Xi has the highest authority to appoint and remove personnel. As long as Liu Xi approves it, he will officially resign. The serious sick leave of the company was approved by the company. He had to cancel the leave to complete all the procedures. He submitted the application from the company intranet and the process will take a few days.Under Cheng Zimei\u2019s \u2018cover\u2019, Shen Dai didn\u2019t see a single acquaintance except for his colleagues in the personnel department. But when he was leaving, he accidentally bumped into Zhou Lan who had just returned from working outside.Shen Dai was wearing a peaked cap with a low brim, but Zhou Lan still recognized him at a glance: \u201cSenior Brother Shen?\u201dShen Dai was stunned, then smiled lightly and said, \u201cZhou Lan, it\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u201cAre you cured? Are you coming back to work?\u201d Zhou Lan quickly looked at Shen Dai. Although he heard a lot of rumours that Shen Dai\u2019s sick leave was related to Qu Moyu, he saw that Shen Dai was a lot haggard than before. The appearance of him recovering from a serious illness made Zhou Lan feel uncomfortable.\u201cI\u2019m coming back to resign.\u201dCheng Zimei let out a sigh.Zhou Lan\u2019s eyes darkened and he didn\u2019t know what to say for a while.Shen Dai looked at Zhou Lan with a calm gaze: \u201cYou are now an official researcher. Congratulations. Study hard in the future and work hard with the teacher and your senior sister Cheng.\u201dZhou Lan nodded: \u201cHmm, I will. Senior Brother Shen, I-I\u2019ll treat you to a meal.\u201d\u201cActually, I should invite you instead but I still have something to do today. I\u2019m sorry but thank you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Can we meet again in the future?\u201d Zhou Lan whispered.\u201cOf course. I\u2019m just changing jobs, not changing careers. We can always meet in various meetings in the industry.\u201d Shen Dai said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when my new job is settled.\u201dZhou Lan reluctantly smiled. There was something else he wanted to say, but he swallowed it in the end.Walking out of the door of the research institute, Shen Dai took a deep breath. He turned around and looked at the place where he had worked for seven years. He had struggled here for many years, but he never thought that one day he would have to reluctantly leave. The frustration and unwillingness are indescribable. His heart was also full of anxiety about the future. But this was the path he had chosen and he had to go forward.Cheng Zimei was also very uncomfortable. She whispered, \u201cAh Dai, do you really have to leave?\u201dShen Dai nodded: \u201cZimei, I felt most sorry for the teacher. You take good care of him for me. Ensure that he drinks less strong tea and smokes less.\u201dCheng Zimei\u2019s eyes turned red: \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d She blinked her eyes hard and forced a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, you have to look forward. I believe you can have a beautiful career anywhere.\u201dShen Dai also smiled: \u201cI also believe in myself. We are just not in the same company anymore but we can still shine on each other on the academic road.\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201d Cheng Zimei took Shen Dai\u2019s arm, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Take me to see my eldest nephew.\u201dWhen Shen Dai went to the company to resign, his grandmother helped to take care of Qiuqiu for the whole morning. Shen Dai was very worried. Firstly, he was worried that Qiuqiu and his grandmother would not know each other well and Qiuqiu would make trouble. Secondly, he was worried that in her old age, she would not be able to keep up with the physical strength to take care of a child. He kept sending WeChat to ask about the situation. He didn\u2019t expect that until he returned to the hotel, Qiuqiu was so well-behaved that he rarely bothered his grandmother.Cheng Zimei was also very excited when she saw Qiuqiu. She hugged and kissed the child several times, coaxing him in an exaggerated tone: \u201cOh, why is Qiuqiu so fragrant and also smelly? Whose alpha baby is so beautiful? Let auntie kiss.\u201dAfter accepting Cheng Zimei\u2019s hard-packed red envelopes and a bunch of baby products, Shen Dai felt embarrassed: \u201cYou buy so many things. How can I bring them on the plane? If you get a salary increase, you will spend money indiscriminately, right?\u201d\u201cSister doesn\u2019t need to raise a baby, so money will be spent randomly.\u201d Cheng Zimei said with a smile, \u201cQiuqiu is really good-looking. He will definitely be super handsome in the future. Auntie will wait for you for at most 18 years.\u201d\u201cThis kind of clothes will become small after wearing it a few times.\u201d Shen Dai picked it up and gestured it around Qiuqiu. It was really cute.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Remember to take a picture when he wears it.\u201d Cheng Zimei thought of something and became lost again, \u201cAre you really going to Lancheng? Have you figured it out? Is it not good to stay in your hometown instead?\u201dGrandma also looked at Shen Dai with helpless eyes, but she didn\u2019t dare to persuade him. If it wasn\u2019t as a last resort, who would want to leave their hometown? She was afraid that her retention would make Shen Dai feel embarrassed.Shen Dai smiled bitterly: \u201cSenior Brother Bai can give me a job. I also submitted a few resumes here, but the salary is definitely not as good as Xingzhou. It was mainly because the capital consumption is too high, I will hire a full-time nanny. Lancheng is two times less expensive compared to here.\u201d He was ashamed to mention the rent. Although he has a house, now he can only let his grandmother and Shen Qin live there. He can\u2019t live in the company dormitory with his child. Hiring a nanny and raising a child\u2026 the financial pressure is too great.Cheng Zimei also sighed. She looked at Shen Dai and then at Qiuqiu. This child looked like Shen Dai at first, but the more she looked at him, the more he looked like Qu Moyu. He was obviously a baby who could be worth hundreds of millions when he landed. Shen Dai was living in such a difficult situation, she really felt sorry for Shen Dai. But she also knew Shen Dai\u2019s character. It was impossible for him to do the same thing as his most hated father had done. She had a lot to say to Shen Dai, but she was afraid of touching his wound, so she could only keep it in her heart.After lunch, his grandmother went home first. Cheng Zimei took a leave of absence and accompanied Shen Dai with his child for the whole afternoon. The content of their conversation avoided Shen Dai\u2019s embarrassing and sad year. They chatted about the industry and the current progress of the projects Shen Dai participated in before. These are topics that make Shen Dai\u2019s eyes shine again.Just as he was talking about his excitement, Shen Dai\u2019s handphone rang.With this new number, very few people knew about it. Shen Dai thought it was a response to his resume, but when he picked his phone up to look, it was from a nameless person. But it had already firmly engraved in his memory and he could never forget it. That string of numbers. He hung up without hesitation.Cheng Zimei didn\u2019t care at first. Nowadays, there are many harassing calls and it is normal not to answer unfamiliar numbers.But the phone rang again. Shen Dai not only hung up this time, but also planned to put it on the blacklist.At this moment, a text message popped up: I\u2019m downstairs at your hotel.Shen Dai\u2019s heart was suffocated and he gritted his teeth lightly.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Who is it?\u201d Cheng Zimei grabbed Qiuqiu\u2019s little hand and waved it over.Shen Dai said, \u201cZimei, I originally wanted to invite you to dinner, but I have something to do. If you go back first, I\u2019ll find you tomorrow or the day after.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright, I don\u2019t mind missing a meal. But your face is not right.\u201d Cheng Zimei looked at his phone suspiciously, \u201cDid you receive any bad news?\u201dHow should Shen Dai explain that Qu Moyu is downstairs?A text message came over: Come downstairs, or I\u2019ll go up to find you.Shen Dai let out a long sigh, holding his mobile phone and wondering what to do. He neither wanted to see Qu Moyu, nor did he want Cheng Zimei to know about this.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Cheng Zimei came over and glanced at the screen, \u201c\u2026Who is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cFuck!\u201d Cheng Zimei made a move and she guessed it for some reason, \u201cIDon\u2019t tell me it\u2019s the crown prince!\u201d She took Qiuqiu a few steps to the window, looked downstairs and sure enough, she saw Qu Moyu\u2019s car. She stared at Shen Dai with wide eyes.Shen Dai stood up and said with a livid face: \u201cZimei, can you help me see Qiuqiu for a while? I\u2019ll go down\u2026 I\u2019ll be back up later.\u201d He knew that Qu Moyu was the type or person who would do what he said he would do. It is better for him to go down than to be called at the door.\u201cYou go.\u201d Cheng Zimei looked at Shen Dai worriedly, \u201cYou\u2026 will you be alright?\u201dShen Dai lightly shook his head.When he reached downstairs, Shen Dai looked at the black Rolls Royce Phantom outside the gate from a distance and he shivered. But he still walked over helplessly.Just as he approached, the door of the driver opened and Lao Wu, who was wearing a jacket and white gloves, got out of the car. He nodded respectfully to Shen Dai and opened the back seat door for him.Familiar scenes replayed in his mind. Shen Dai remembered many scenes similar to this scene. There was such a scene where he wore a custom suit to attend Qu\u2019s family banquet, where he was late for work and Qu Moyu asked him to take a ride, and where he sneaked off work to the parking lot to find Qu Moyu. When he was invited to get in the car, he had several changes in his mentality. But each time, without exception, his feelings for Qu Moyu gradually progressed.However, this time, he felt that the open car door was like a bottomless black hole, with a vicious beast hiding in it that would devour him completely.And he had nowhere to run.He gathered all his courage to get into the car.Qu Moyu was still wearing a suit and leather shoes. He was sitting in the leather seat with his long legs folded, but there was no document or tablet in his hands. He put his hands with his fingers interspersed on his knees and tilted his head to look at him.Qu Moyu has lost weight, which was more obvious than the last time when he saw him in Lancheng. He clearly looked\u00a0 a little haggard. The energy of the S-class alpha is different from that of ordinary people. If he hadn\u2019t experienced excessive physical or mental work, he would not be so tired.As soon as Shen Dai sat down, Lao Wu closed the car door and walked to the side to smoke.Qu Moyu looked at Shen Dai who was close at hand and smelled a faint fragrance of Epiphyllum. He had survived the hellish torment during the susceptible period and he warned himself not to hastily scare away his prey.Shen Dai didn\u2019t look at Qu Moyu. He lowered his head and said, \u201cIs there anything you want?\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s the child?\u201d Qu Moyu asked in a low voice.\u201cIn the hotel room.\u201d\u201cMy mother wants to see him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Shen Dai couldn\u2019t find a reason to refuse. Without Mrs. Qu\u2019s help, he would not be able to give birth to Qiuqiu. This request is reasonable enough.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.07.04\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: See you guys next week.

All the painful memories that were once sweet and finally destroyed beyond recognition have settled in that house, hidden like cobwebs and dust in the corners just waiting to be discovered.Qu Moyu hesitated for a moment: \u201cThen, let\u2019s go to the apartment in the city centre.\u201dShen Dai was silent for a moment and then asked, \u201cIs it really Madam Qu who wants to see Qiuqiu?\u201d\u201cQiuqiu?\u201d\u201cMy child\u2019s nickname.\u201d\u201c\u2018Qiuqiu\u2019.\u201d Qu Moyu pronounced it carefully and thought that the nickname was very cute. Just saying it out loud gave him a sweet feeling, \u201cShe wanted to see him.\u201dShen Dai took a deep breath: \u201cI\u2019ll go bring him down.\u201dShen Dai returned to the room and packed Qiuqiu\u2019s necessities into his backpack. He then took the child from Cheng Zimei\u2019s hand and faced her searching gaze. She reluctantly said, \u201cIt\u2019s his mother who wants to see Qiuqiu.\u201dCheng Zimei nodded vigorously: \u201cLet\u2019s go down.\u201dQiuqiu babbled to Cheng Zimei, as if saying goodbye.When they reached downstairs, Lao Wu was already waiting by the car door. The moment he saw Qiuqiu, his eyes brightened and he was even a little excited.When Shen Dai got into the car, Qiuqiu was unaware at first, but as soon as the door was closed, Qiuqiu was stunned. He was blinking his round eyes and looking at Qu Moyu. Before Qu Moyu could say a word, his mouth was opened wide and he burst into tears.This howling startled the three adults in the car. The pressure on the heart of this volume of crying in a closed car is about the same as being close to the power amplifier in a nightclub.\u201cDon\u2019t cry. Stop crying.\u201d Shen Dai stroked Qiuqiu\u2019s back and gave Qu Moyu a complicated look.Qu Moyu frowned, remembering that Shen Dai said the other day that Qiuqiu was afraid of him. He is the father of this little bastard, what is he afraid of?!Qiuqiu\u2019s fear of Qu Moyu is very obvious. He is still practising turning over and twisting his body hard, but he could only put his butt towards Qu Moyu and then grabs his two small hands in the direction of the car window, trying to escape from there. .Shen Dai was so distressed by Qiuqiu\u2019s crying that he released his pheromone, patted Qiuqiu with one hand and turned over his backpack with the other.\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d Qu Moyu helped him unzip the zipper, took the opportunity to lean over and sniffed Shen Dai\u2019s pheromone. Shen Dai\u2019s pheromone\u2019s scent was always light, but the wisp of pheromone he caught was enough for his body to heat up.\u201cA grey bear.\u201dQu Moyu found the plush toy that was only the size of his palm from the bag and his face changed the moment he touched it.That thing exudes a pure woody fragrance \u2013 it is Bai Xiangwan\u2019s pheromone.Shen Dai took the bear and stuffed it into Qiuqiu\u2019s arms: \u201cBe good. Be good. Don\u2019t cry.\u201dQiuqiu hugged the bear and under the comfort of Bai Xiangwan\u2019s pheromone, his howling became weaker and he began to hiccup. But his body was still struggling in the opposite direction of Qu Moyu, his big eyes seemed to be soaked in water. He looked very pitiful.Qu Moyu\u2019s face was ashen: \u201cWhat is this?\u201dShen Dai was in a hurry to calm Qiuqiu and ignored Qu Moyu. Should he answer that this is just a baby toy? He freed his hand, took out another small spray bottle from his bag and sprayed the bear.The scent of white elm in the car became more intense.Qu Moyu clenched his fists with anger: \u201cWhat are you doing? You still carry Bai Xiangwan\u2019s pheromone with you?!\u201dShen Dai explained calmly: \u201cThis is a substitute pheromone made by Senior Brother Bai\u2019s gland fluid. Qiuqiu likes the scent. He needs a substitute pheromone when he grows up.\u201d\u201cHe should use mine.\u201d Qu Moyu was also disturbed by Qiuqiu\u2019s crying. His omega is using another alpha pheromone as pacifiers for their children, how can he ever be humiliated like this?!Shen Dai gave him a cold look: \u201cHe has never seen you before. And now he is more afraid of you. To him, you are just a stranger who once threatened him.\u201dQu Moyu was speechless. Thinking about what happened that night, he regretted it even more. He has never been someone who acts impulsively. Why has he repeatedly acted stupid in front of Shen Dai?Seeing that Qiuqiu was crying so hard that she couldn\u2019t breathe, Shen Dai really had no choice. So he opened the car door: \u201cSend me the address and I\u2019ll take a taxi there.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get out of the car.\u201d Qu Moyu took a deep breath. He suppressed his anger and grievances. He then opened the door and got out to sit in the co-pilot.Across the partition, Qu Moyu\u2019s pheromone was successfully blocked. Qiuqiu\u2019s senses had not yet developed and soon he could only smell the pheromones of Shen Dai and Bai Xiangwan. He gradually calmed down.Shen Dai coaxed softly and hummed a lullaby in a low voice, hoping that Qiuqiu would fall asleep soon. Usually, after crying like this, he will be tired.Sitting in the co-pilot, Qu Moyu kept peeping at Shen Dai from the rearview mirror, seeing him with lowered eyebrows and softly coaxing their children. His patience and tenderness looked heart-warming. Despite that, Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t portray any warmth.That is his omega. That is their child. The three of them should be together.Qiuqiu fell asleep halfway through. When they got there, Lao Wu carried Shen Dai\u2019s bag and took them upstairs. Qu Moyu could only follow behind them and he didn\u2019t even dare to take an elevator with Qiuqiu.\u201cMr. Shen, is this child a little alpha? He\u2019s so cute. When I hear his cry, I think he is very energetic.\u201d Lao Wu looked at Qiuqiu frequently.Shen Dai smiled lightly: \u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve troubled you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright, there\u2019s no way a child doesn\u2019t cry.\u201d Lao Wu said with a smile, \u201cOh, Madam must be very happy.\u201dWhen the two entered the room, Mrs. Qu seemed to have been waiting for a long time. She immediately stood up from the sofa and walked over quickly: \u201cShen Dai\u2026 How are you?\u201dWhen Shen Dai saw Mrs. Qu, he was filled with emotion. Without her, there would be no Qiuqiu. He will never forget this kindness in his life. \u201cWe are fine.\u201dMrs. Qu looked at the sleeping Qiuqiu and reached out her hand cautiously. But she didn\u2019t dare to touch him. It was as if it was a fragile dream that could not stand the test of reality. She smiled, but her eyes quickly turned red. She stared at Qiuqiu without blinking, fingers pressed against her lips, suppressed her thoughts and trembled slightly.Shen Dai couldn\u2019t imagine the turbulent emotions in her heart at the moment. He whispered, \u201cWould you like to hold him?\u201d\u201cHe\u2026 he is asleep.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. He was tired from crying just now. It\u2019s not so easy for him to wake up once he falls asleep.\u201dMrs. Qu stretched out her hand. Her slender arms changed angles several times, eager to try, but she seemed unable to start. She had not held a child for too long. And she no longer knew how to properly hold such a precious and fragile thing.In the end, with the help of Shen Dai, he placed Qiuqiu into her arms. Qiuqiu slapped his mouth twice, his red eyelids trembled, but he didn\u2019t wake up.Mrs. Qu took a deep breath. She looked at Shen Dai and smiled in relief.Shen Dai said softly, \u201cLet\u2019s take him into the room.\u201d Qu Moyu would come in soon, so he couldn\u2019t let him get close to Qiuqiu.Mrs. Qu carried Qiuqiu into the bedroom. There was a large double bed measuring 1.8 metres in the bedroom. But she still wanted to hold the child in her arms and looked at him with joy: \u201cHe is so cute. Just like when Mo Yu was a child.\u201dShen Dai was a little embarrassed.Mrs. Qu also realised that this sentence should not be said. She asked, \u201cWhy did he cry just now?\u201d Her original intention was to change the topic, but unfortunately this topic was even more embarrassing.Shen Dai heard the voice of Qu Moyu entering the door of the house and could only tell the truth: \u201cHe is afraid of Mr. Qu. So he can\u2019t get too close to Mr. Qu.\u201dMadam Qu was stunned for a moment: \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Shen Dai didn\u2019t really know how to explain.Mrs. Qu might have vaguely guessed something and sighed in her heart: \u201cThen don\u2019t let him come close.\u201dThe two stayed in the room for a while and Mrs. Qu asked a lot of questions about Qiuqiu including why Qiuqiu had other alpha pheromones and Shen Dai answered truthfully.At this moment, there was a knock on the door. Qu Moyu\u2019s voice came in a low voice: \u201cCan I come in?\u201dShen Dai hurriedly got up. He pulled the door open a gap and stuck out only half of his head: \u201cQiuqiu is asleep.\u201dQu Moyu smelled the scent of Bai Xiangwan that was on Shen Dai\u2019s body. He suppressed his jealousy and said in a low voice, \u201cCan we talk a little?\u201dShen Dai looked at Qu Moyu alertly, not wanting to go out, nor letting Qu Moyu come in. The last time Qu Moyu said he wanted to \u2018talk\u2019, what did he do?Qu Moyu softened his tone: \u201cI won\u2019t do anything to you. I just want to talk.\u201dShen Dai looked back at Qiuqiu, walked out sideways and closed the door. He stared at Qu Moyu and warned coldly, \u201cYour mother is here. Be decent, okay?\u201dQu Moyu only felt his face get hot, as if he had been slapped by Shen Dai. In Shen Dai\u2019s eyes, what kind of person did he become? A person who would resort to violence? Or a pervert who would fuck anywhere?He was blinded by anger and jealousy before. But now that he is sober, he knows very clearly that he wants Shen Dai. Whether he likes him or is just possessive of him, he can\u2019t stand Shen Dai being with others. The yearning and longing for this person during the susceptible period has made him experience torture. No matter what means he uses, he wants to bring both his omega and his child back to him obediently!\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.07.05\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: I\u2019m most annoyed when QMY still regards SD as \u2018his omega\u2019.

He really did not expect that the first sentence Qu Moyu would say would be an apology. He had already shaken off his entire body\u2019s defence mechanism to face any harm that Qu Moyu might bring from his words and actions.\u201cWhen I was in Lancheng, I said some hasty words and acted impulsively. That was not my intention. I was not thinking straight at the time.\u201d Qu Moyu looked at Shen Dai with sincerity.Shen Dai thought for a while and nodded. He wouldn\u2019t put down his guard just because of an apology. What Qu Moyu did to him couldn\u2019t be smoothed out with a single \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019, but he tried his best not to be angry at this person.\u201cI checked later. Bai Xiangwan usually lives in the company\u2019s dormitory. Although you live in his house, there\u2019s none of his daily necessities at home. I should have figured it out at the time\u2026\u201d Qu Moyu was very annoyed at his own stupidity. It\u2019s just that when he smelled another alpha\u2019s pheromone in Shen Dai\u2019s room, all his emotion management training was in vain and he lost control.Shen Dai also breathed a sigh of relief. At least Qu Moyu won\u2019t bother Bai Xiangwan anymore. Bai Xiangwan has already helped him too much and he shouldn\u2019t be dragged down by him anymore.\u201cAs for Qiuqiu\u2019s use of his pheromone as a substitute pheromone, this point needs to be corrected slowly. Don\u2019t worry, I have consulted a doctor. His functional system is still developing. So it is not difficult to correct it.\u201d There is no reason or relationship between Bai Xiangwan and Shen Dai that caused an alpha to help an omega to that point. Qu Moyu suspected that Bai Xiangwan must have some sort of feelings for Shen Dai. Not to mention, how can he bear his son to treat another alpha as his father instead?Shen Dai frowned lightly: \u201cNo need to correct anything. The doctor said that the child will only need it until he is two or three years old. After that, he will naturally get rid of his excessive dependence on pheromones.\u201d\u201cIt has only been three months now. Are you going to keep using Bai Xiangwan\u2019s pheromone? I\u2019m his alpha father. My pheromone is the best for him.\u201d\u201cYour pheromone will only frighten him and make him cry.\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s face changed slightly: \u201cI admit that I scared him that time. That is my fault. But we are still connected by blood. Even if he lacks the participation of my pheromone in the process of gestation, as long as we get along more, he will definitely recognise me.\u201dShen Dai said in a low voice, \u201cThat is not necessary.\u201d\u201c\u2026What is \u2018not necessary\u2019?\u201dShen Dai looked at Qu Moyu calmly: \u201cQiuqiu is used to Senior Brother Bai\u2019s pheromone. So I\u2019ll just use his every time. There is no need to correct anything at the expense of increasing his anxiety. This child is just my child. His surname is Shen. You don\u2019t need to get along with him.\u201dQu Moyu stared into Shen Dai\u2019s eyes and said solemnly: \u201cAh Dai, am I not clear enough? I miss you very much. I want you to take our child and come back to me. I will definitely give you the best life. Qiuqiu should also have his real alpha father around.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s heart was suffocating. In the beginning, Qu Moyu wished he could get rid of the trouble which was the existence of him and Qiuqiu as soon as possible. What is this now? He couldn\u2019t guess the real purpose of Qu Moyu\u2019s actions. But there was absolutely no possibility that it was simply because of \u2018feelings\u2019. This person has no feelings. He was silent for a while and then said: \u201cMr. Qu, what exactly is your intention?\u201dQu Moyu took a deep breath and suddenly grabbed Shen Dai\u2019s hand, preventing him from taking it back: \u201cI like you.\u201dShen Dai froze for a moment. There\u2019s mixed feelings in his heart, accompanied by clear pain. He had imagined countless times before that this person would say that he liked him and now he did get it. There were two times in total. The first time was when Qu Moyu completely denied the value of the existence of this emotion. The second time was when Qu Moyu tried to use a flower to decorate the wild grass in his heart. So much so that he felt that it was blasphemy to hear the word \u2018like\u2019 coming out of this person\u2019s mouth. His chest was boiling with anger but he suppressed it and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to \u2018like\u2019 someone at all.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s icy eyes made Qu Moyu feel extremely uncomfortable: \u201cI have never treated anyone like how I treated you. And I have never wanted someone so much. How can you define what \u2018liking\u2019 someone means for me? Can my feelings even be defined by this one simple word? Forget it. What I mean is that I am willing to take care of you for the rest of my life.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s chest heaved for a while. He thought he would never have a chance to hear something like this in his life. But what\u2019s the point of complaining about the wound to the executioner? Now the executioner wanted to expose his wound to the sun by saying things he no longer wants to hear. He gritted his teeth and said: \u201cI can\u2019t define how others feel. But you definitely don\u2019t deserve to say that you \u2018like\u2019 me. Allow me to remind you again that when I said I didn\u2019t collude with your enemies to trick you, you don\u2019t believe me and you don\u2019t care. You forced me to wash off the mark, knock out the child, and even while I was pregnant with Qiuqiu, you suppressed me with pheromones\u2026\u201d\u201cAh Dai!\u201d Qu Moyu interrupted Shen Dai loudly. His face was full of confusion and his pupils flashed with guilt, \u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have treated you like that.\u201d The more he longed for Shen Dai, the more he didn\u2019t dare to recall what happened a year ago. And he didn\u2019t dare to face the damages he had caused to Shen Dai. He has always been weighing the pros and cons since he was a child and he has hardly made a wrong decision. At the beginning, all the choices were made based on the current problem. He never considered right or wrong in his heart. He only considered himself. At that time, he felt that Shen Dai was just a highly replaceable lover, even if he was the one he cared about most, he would never influence his interests for the sake of a little personal love. He should never have let Shen Dai go. Today\u2019s apology and negotiation are the biggest compromises in his life that he made by lowering his ego.Shen Dai clenched his fists that were twitching gently with every breath.\u201cI faced Qu Chengchen after that.\u201d Qu Moyu said sternly, \u201cHe admitted that he was the one who plotted against me during the susceptible period. I know I misunderstood you. You and Qiuqiu are both innocent. Let me bear the burden and take responsibility, okay?\u201dShen Dai once wanted to prove his innocence very much. But now, he got it so lightly. He was in the same mood as when Qu Moyu was too lazy to listen to his explanation. Now, it doesn\u2019t matter. It doesn\u2019t matter. It really doesn\u2019t matter anymore. He no longer needs Qu Moyu\u2019s approval. Because he no longer needs Qu Moyu. He looked at Qu Moyu with his eyes that seemed to be covered with a layer of grey fog and asked, \u201cIf you know the truth from the start, will the outcome be different?\u201dQu Moyu was stunned for a moment. Shen Dai took advantage of him to be stunned and finally pulled back his painfully clenched hand from Qu Moyu\u2019s grip.\u201cI\u2019m still an inferior omega who doesn\u2019t deserve your \u2018mark\u2019. I\u2019m from a poor background, with a low pheromone level, and I can\u2019t give birth to an S-level alpha heir for you. You\u2019re still going to marry someone who matches you and have kids with them. And you\u2019re still going to divorce me and let me wash off the \u2018mark\u2019 and knock out the child, won\u2019t you?\u201dQu Moyu looked at his empty palm, where there was still warmth belonging to Shen Dai lingered. But Shen Dai refused to let him touch him again. He opened his mouth, trying to justify himself. He could lie without changing his face anywhere and to anyone at all. But under the staring gaze of Shen Dai\u2019s eyes that seemed to see through everything, he couldn\u2019t say anything. Shen Dai was right. He felt ashamed being judged under that kind of gaze.Qu Moyu lowered his head and adjusted his breath slowly, restraining the irritability of being repeatedly rejected and the embarrassment of being poked at where it exactly hurts. When he raised his head again, his eyes regained clarity. He said softly, \u201cAh Dai, we came from two different backgrounds, experiences, education, and cognition. They are completely different. But I like you and you like me too. We also have a child together. We have to find a way to live with each other in order to go on, right?\u201dShen Dai looked at Qu Moyu coldly. He had already guessed what Qu Moyu was going to say.\u201cMy background determines that my marriage will not be the result of love. Instead, it is for the integration of resources and interests. My fianc\u00e9e is also very aware of this. He can give me what I really need in my marriage.\u201d Qu Moyu stared into Shen Dai\u2019s eyes, \u201cWe don\u2019t need marriage or \u2018mark\u2019. But I promise to give you and Qiuqiu a future far beyond your imagination. Why should you be obsessed with what your status is?\u201dThis time, Shen Dai looked at Qu Moyu for a long time. It was for more than ten seconds, as if he was repeatedly confirming that they were really in the same time and space. But they are still so far away from each other and it hurts him. It was like being pierced in the heart. But he still formed a smile: \u201cMr. Qu, you are right. Different people have different ways of living. You can pursue what you want, no one dares to stop you. And I also want to pursue what I want.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Qu Moyu felt that his patience was quickly being worn away.Shen Dai said seriously: \u201cI want nothing to do with your money. I want nothing to do with your name. I want you not to appear in front of me. I want nothing from you and I don\u2019t want you.\u201d He spoke slowly. It was as if he was afraid that Qu Mo Yu might have missed listening to a single word he had said and could not fully understand his determination.Qu Moyu\u2019s complexion turned pale in an instant. He has never been repeatedly rejected and despised like this in his life. Even if he let go of the spirit that hangs above the nine heavens and bowed his head to a mere omega, he was still at the upper hand in his life. The compromises he made were returned in exchange for such contempt! He stared at Shen Dai, gritted his teeth and said, \u201cWhy are you so stubborn and ignorant? You can sell your body to a stranger for 10 million yuan but why is love above everything now? Do you want me to suspect that you wanted to raise the price and hoped for a bigger profit??\u201dShen Dai seemed to be numb to these poisoned words and he was not surprised by Qu Moyu\u2019s change of face. He knew the arrogance of this S-class alpha too well. For him to pretend to be docile was just a strategy at the negotiating table. If he still believed him, it meant that he had not learned enough lessons. He stood up and said, \u201cMr. Qu, if you really feel a little bit of guilt and pity for me and Qiuqiu, please don\u2019t bother us again.\u201dQu Moyu followed Shen Dai\u2019s back gloomily with his eyes, until the person in sight walked into the room and closed the door behind him.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.07.06\u058d\u058d\u058dQu Moyu to Shen Dai: I like you and you like me too.Me: Who dafakk likes you?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was almost impossible for Qiuqiu to be so calm when he was alone with strangers. But in Madam Qu\u2019s arms, he seemed to feel very secure. It made Shen Dai realise the power of blood relation.Mrs. Qu was full of smiles: \u201cLook. He is very close to me and he smiles at me.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s mood hadn\u2019t been adjusted yet but he still forced a smile: \u201cYes.\u201dSeeing his pale face, Mrs. Qu asked cautiously, \u201cDid you two have a good talk?\u201d\u201cHow did you know we talked?\u201d Shen Dai sat beside the bed, \u201cI mean, what did he tell you?\u201dMrs. Qu said: \u201cAfter he came back from Lancheng, he entered the susceptible period. When he was in the susceptible period, he missed you very much.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s reaction during the susceptible period made her feel that her son really liked Shen Dai. It would be the best result if they could reunite as a family of three. \u201cAfter the susceptible period, he wanted to go to Lancheng to find you, but when he found out that you were back in the capital, he asked me if I wanted to meet Qiuqiu.\u201dShen Dai thought to himself that it\u2019s sure enough. How could someone like Qu Moyu come to him with a low profile and apologise to him? The \u2018mark\u2019 used to have an impact on both body and mind. Even if the \u2018mark\u2019 disappeared, there would still be side effects. The injury on his body made him only reject Qu Moyu. Meanwhile, during the susceptible period, Qu Moyu would be amplified by his emotions and desires of the time they spent together.It seems that Qu Moyu really \u2018likes\u2019 him. He would like him to become a convenient lover like before.Mrs. Qu couldn\u2019t understand Shen Dai\u2019s silence so she tentatively said, \u201cHe said that you came back this time to resign. Do you really plan to stay in Lancheng?\u201d\u201cI have already found a good job in Lancheng and my life is stable.\u201d Originally, Shen Dai was still weighing and hesitating. But today, Qu Moyu\u2019s attitude made him firmly want to stay away.Mrs. Qu glanced at Qiuqiu in her arms and hesitated, unable to hide her disappointment.Shen Dai saw that Mrs. Qu was reluctant to be separated from Qiuqiu. He felt a little regretful in his heart: \u201cMy grandmother wants to stay here so I will come back every once in a while. If you want to see Qiuqiu, you can also come to Lancheng to see us.\u201dMrs. Qu nodded sadly: \u201cWhen will you go back? Can I see Qiuqiu before you leave?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m waiting for the resignation process to finish. I should stay for a few more days. If it\u2019s convenient for you, you can find me at my hotel.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just stay here? This apartment is under my name. You\u2019ll have everything here. I can get baby supplies for you right away.\u201dShen Dai politely declined: \u201cThank you. but I\u2019ll just stay at the hotel.\u201dThat night, Shen Dai returned to the hotel in Madam Qu\u2019s car. On this day, he was busy from morning to night. And he also had faced a \u2018confrontation\u2019 with Qu Moyu. After feeding Qiuqiu to sleep, he was already physically and mentally exhausted. But he still couldn\u2019t fall asleep.He always felt that Qu Moyu would not let it go. He just hoped to finish what he had to do quickly and return to Lancheng as soon as possible. It is so that he will not have too many things to think about at night.The next morning, Shen Dai received a phone call from HR, informing him that there was a problem with the resignation procedure. His long sick leave must be supported by a hospital\u2019s case. Otherwise, it would be regarded as a long-term absence from work and he could not leave the job normally. His minimum wage and social security can also be affected.Shen Dai explained: \u201cMy sick leave was approved from the beginning.\u201d\u201cYes, but it is not in line with the process and the company\u2019s regulations.\u201d HR said in a formulaic tone, \u201cThe leader who gave you special approval violated the company\u2019s rules and will be punished in response. You also need to prove your sick leave with a supported document.\u201dShen Dai only felt that his blood was rising for a while. He knew that this must be done by Qu Moyu. Isn\u2019t Qu Moyu himself the leader who gave him special approval? What kind of punishment can the personnel department impose on the person who is in control of the shareholder of the company? Deducti his wage?? He suppressed his anger and said, \u201cWhat if I can\u2019t provide the supporting document? Since my leave has been approved, it should take effect.\u201d\u201cThis sick leave does not comply with the company\u2019s regulations. It is against the procedures and regulations. If you have any objection, I suggest you go to labour arbitration.\u201dAfter he hung up the phone, Shen Dai\u2019s eyes were red with anger. His sick leave was specially approved by the CEO. Of course he has a reason, but now the company does not recognize it. If he wants his \u2018reason\u2019 to be approved, he can only apply for arbitration. He doesn\u2019t have the energy and time to deal with this. But if he is considered to be absent from work during his contract period, there will be a major blemish on his resume. The return of the basic salary for the year is a small matter. If the company deliberately makes things difficult when transferring his social security, it will be even more troublesome.When he went to resign yesterday, the personnel department didn\u2019t have any questions about this at all. Their attitude today has changed greatly. It can only be done by Qu Moyu. Otherwise, which employee would dare to say that Qu Moyu violated the company\u2019s rules?He didn\u2019t expect Qu Moyu to do such a despicable thing. Why did this person hurt him again and again and still refuse to let him go?!Holding the phone tightly, he called Qu Moyu.Before the first ring of the phone was over, it was already connected. Qu Moyu\u2019s deep voice came from the microphone: \u201cAh Dai.\u201d\u201cWhat else do you want to do?\u201d Shen Dai asked coldly.\u201cI\u2019ve told you that I will not accept your resignation or transfer.\u201d Qu Moyu sighed lightly, \u201cAh Dai, don\u2019t go to Lancheng. Stay here. Stay by my side.\u201dShen Dai glanced at the innocent little baby on the bed and clenched his fists: \u201cMr. Qu, please let me go.\u201d\u201cIf you change your ideals on some things, your decision can be changed.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s tone was so calm that it was frightening. \u201cYou are engaged in scientific research, so you should know how to be flexible. Don\u2019t be so stubborn, okay?\u201d\u201cAs you said, we are not the same. I have the life I want to live.\u201dQu Moyu was silent for a while: \u201cThink about Qiuqiu. He needs his real alpha father, the best growth environment and the best education. He will even have more room for potential in the future. What you can give him is limited when he could have gotten a lot more.\u201d Qu Moyu picked up Qiuqiu\u2019s medical record book that had been on his desk and flipped through it. Every word on it had a different kind of meaning to him. He felt the warmth because the book had recorded the progress of a child belonging to him and Shen Dai.\u201cEveryone has their own destiny. He may not have very advantageous conditions, but I will not provide him any less. How much he will get in the end depends on himself. Besides\u2026\u201d Shen Dai gritted his teeth, \u201cHe originally didn\u2019t even have a chance to be born. Don\u2019t you forget that you didn\u2019t want him in the first place.\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s heart clenched hard and he said solemnly: \u201cI regret it, I admit. I want him. And I want you too. Qiuqiu is our child, no matter what gender or pheromone level he is. I will give him the best.\u201d When he turned to the next page, he found that the column for pheromone level was empty.How could it be empty? Is there an error in the system entry? He thought to himself.Shen Dai took a deep breath as his voice trembled slightly: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need it. No need.\u201d His child does not need a ruthless alpha father nor does he need an education method that puts interests first before anything else. And his child does not need to be privileged or wealthy. He just needs to grow up to be a kind and normal person.Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes became more and more gloomy: \u201cAh Dai, you are trapped in emotions right now. That\u2019s why you\u2019re resisting me and my good intentions. Why don\u2019t you calm down for a few days and consider my suggestions carefully? Think about the benefits for you and the benefits for Qiuqiu. Our family will be happy together.\u201dShen Dai hung up the phone. He didn\u2019t want to listen to any more hypocritical and sharp words from Qu Moyu\u2019s mouth. The worst thing he had done in his life was to fall in love with Qu Moyu and believed that he could impress someone with his emotions. A person without emotion will never make the same mistake.Shen Dai told Liu Xi and Cheng Zimei about the resignation issue. Liu Xi was also very angry, but he could not do anything. The three studied for a long time but they still couldn\u2019t come up with a good solution for a while. Liu Xi planned to ask a friend to go to the personnel department to ask about the situation.Shen Dai was very anxious. He was afraid of what Qu Moyu would do and he was even more anxious about not knowing when these things would be resolved. If he spent a day here, he would have to pay an extra day for the hotel. If he was alone, he would definitely find himself a cheap little hotel to stay at but he has Qiuqiu with him so he had to stay somewhere decent.Cheng Zimei discovered his embarrassment in time and asked him to live in her own house. With the help of her parents, she had bought a single apartment. Although it is small, it is very warmly furnished.Shen Dai was under pressure and had no choice but to be the one who caused trouble for others. Cheng Zimei has been late and leaving early these days, just to help him take care of the child for a while. It makes him feel both moved and embarrassed.At the same time, he watched Cheng Zimei wearing a white lab coat that she didn\u2019t have time to change after work, entering the house in a turbulent manner, and complaining about her work casually. He seemed to see his past life when he was busy but it was fulfilling. His heart was full of envy and sorrow.Liu Xi\u2019s friend quickly gave feedback \u2013 there was no news. The personnel department kept silent about it. That alone explained a lot of things.Shen Dai was so angry that he couldn\u2019t eat. He knew that Qu Moyu was waiting for him to bow down his head, but he would never accept the \u2018flexibility\u2019 that Qu Moyu was referring to. He seriously thought about the worst outcome. And that is to be dismissed from work which will leave a blemish on his resume. But Bai Xiangwan has promised to give the work to him and even if the minimum wage for a year is not that much, he will still take it. If there is a problem with social security, he will have to make up for it for one year. All these difficulties can be overcome. He has climbed out of the deepest abyss and he will not fall down again here.After making up his mind, he called the personnel department and said that he could not provide the supporting medical documents. He would also return the salary he received during the sick leave. He accepted this penalty. As long as he could get away from Qu Moyu as soon as possible and start a new life.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.07.07\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: What a prick QMY is! -KPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was already a light sleeper but he woke up to the first cry of Qiuqiu.He was always sensitive to Qiuqiu\u2019s cry at night to the point that his body would make a conditioned reflex before his brain. He sat up from the bed at once. The delayed sleepiness made him dazed for a while, but he quickly woke up and went to lightly pat Qiuqiu\u2019s small chest, soothed him in a low voice, and then hugged Qiuqiu and rocked him.Cheng Zimei slept next door. She had to go to work during the day. Because Qiuqiu didn\u2019t rest well these days, Shen Dai was very eager to hope that Qiuqiu would be quiet as soon as possible. But he soon found out that something was wrong. He touched Qiuqiu\u2019s forehead in a shock. It was so hot. He put his hand into the child\u2019s collar again and felt that the heat of the skin was obviously abnormal.Shen Dai\u2019s brain was emptied and immediately filled with anxiety \u2013 Qiuqiu had a fever! Generally, newborns do not get sick before they are half a year old, because the body still carries the immunity obtained from the mother. But because Qiuqiu lacks the pheromone of the alpha father during the whole pregnancy process, the physique is weak. The doctor reminded him of the related risks, so he must provide a stable and safe environment for Qiuqiu.Flying on a plane, being unaccustomed to the environment, being frightened by Qu Moyu, and contacting strangers are all very stressful for a young child.Shen Dai was deeply remorseful and his heart was as painful as if it was being roasted. The most painful thing for him was that he had no other way at all to stop this. There was no one who could help him to solve the problem of leaving. And also no one could take care of his child for him. And no one could stop Qu Moyu from approaching him again and again.The hardships of life are indescribable. Just going through it has exhausted all of his strengths.Shen Dai woke Cheng Zimei up with a sense of guilt and asked her to accompany him to the hospital. He couldn\u2019t take care of the child and register and pay at the same time.When the two got into the taxi, it was just dawn and Cheng Zimei was yawning. At the same time, they used their mobile phones to check how to care for the baby\u2019s fever.When the driver learned that Qiuqiu had a fever, he drove very fast and did not forget to comfort them along the way.When they arrived at the hospital, Shen Dai took Qiuqiu to consult the doctor. The doctor suggested using physical cooling and antipyretic medicines. No injections were given and they were kept in the hospital for observation for a period of time.The nearest hospital is a public hospital. The paediatrics department is full of children. Some of them are big and some are small. One after another, the sound of crying can overturn the roof. Just being in this environment makes people feel irritable and it hurts the head like it\u2019s about to explode.The doctors and nurses were too busy. After Shen Dai fed Qiuqiu the medicine, he sat with the crying child for more than an hour before the nurse took him to rub Qiuqiu\u2019s body with warm water. The nurse hurriedly explained to Shen Dai on how to wipe and demonstrated it for him to do it himself. She then quickly went to see other patients.Shen Dai seemed to have been hit with adrenaline. His mobility was very high but he could clearly sense the tiredness of his body. He said to Cheng Zimei, \u201cYou go to work. I will observe him for a few hours. When the fever subsides, it should be fine.\u201d\u201cIf I go, how can I let you be so busy all by yourself?\u201d Cheng Zimei looked at Shen Dai\u2019s haggard appearance and felt very uncomfortable. She sighed, \u201cRaising children is too difficult. I don\u2019t want to have children anymore.\u201dShen Dai wanted to say that raising a child alone is difficult but it would not be so difficult if a husband and wife were doing it together. But he couldn\u2019t say it because he would be a typical negative example for her.\u201cYou rest for a while. I will\u2026 I will wipe him.\u201d Cheng Zimei saw Qiuqiu\u2019s eyelids falling. \u201cLook. He is about to fall asleep.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t leave. He will cry again soon if he can\u2019t feel my pheromone.\u201d Shen Dai looked at Qiuqiu, who was shivering from crying. His face flushed red, his nose looked sore, and he almost burst into tears.There are many, many difficult moments such as this in his life such as going to a maternity check-up himself with a belly up, preparing supplies for childbirth, the pain of childbirth and the pain after childbirth, the exhaustion of taking care of the child day and night, and seeing the business that has been painstakingly managed for many years being delayed. They all had left him with his emotions on the verge of collapse. Deep down in his heart, he questioned himself: Do you regret it?He listened carefully to his inner voice every time, analysed and thought calmly after the pain, and the answer every time was always the same: There are no regrets.He believes that the most difficult time is over and he believes that the faith and strength that this child brings him far exceeds what he had lost.Shen Dai stood guard for several hours, not daring to rest and kept looking at Qiuqiu as he sometimes dozed off against the wall. Qiuqiu\u2019s temperature dropped a little, but the fever didn\u2019t subside completely. Sometimes he woke up crying and sometimes he fell asleep. The doctor asked him to observe for two more hours before deciding whether to go home or to get further treatment.When Qu Moyu walked into the noisy paediatric ward, what he saw was Shen Dai\u2019s weak, hunched back, with his shoulders and head pressed against the cold wall, congealed and motionless like a sculpture.Qu Moyu felt sour in his heart, unable to accept that his omega had to work so hard and be in such a mess. He walked over slowly and just when he was hesitating whether to approach or not, Shen Dai sensed something first and turned around.Shen Dai\u2019s eyes were gloomy, the white eyeballs were bloodshot, his complexion was paper-like, and his lips were chapped. He looked as if he was sick.Qu Moyu was distressed and angry. The cries and screams of the children around him made the muscles of his temples throb. He had never been in such an environment before, a place where he was surrounded by pain, noise, anxiety, resentment and the smell of hydrogen peroxide. He really wanted to put his wife and child in his arms and leave this place immediately.Shen Dai\u2019s face became even more ugly the moment he saw him.Qu Moyu took a deep breath: \u201cI called you but you turned off the phone and I went to the lobby to find you. The front desk said you took the child to the hospital in the middle of the night and I found that it was here.\u201dShen Dai was so tired that he didn\u2019t even want to say a word. He just glanced at him and turned around.\u201cLet\u2019s go to my hospital, where there is no shortage of staff, doctors and nurses that can take care of Qiuqiu.\u201d Qu Moyu said softly, \u201cYou can\u2019t take care of him like this.\u201dShen Dai looked at Qiuqiu who was gasping for breath, his eyes turning red.\u201cDon\u2019t be stubborn at this time. Come with me.\u201dCheng Zimei, who went out to buy coffee, had just came back. She stared at Qu Moyu with wide eyes.Qu Moyu glanced at her: \u201cCheng Gong, right?\u201d He knew that she was Shen Dai\u2019s classmate and friend. Although it is almost impossible for a male omega to have feelings for a female beta, at this moment, Cheng Zimei implicitly took his place and role, which still made him feel uncomfortable.\u201cPrin-\u2026 Mr. Qu.\u201d Cheng Zimei looked at Shen Dai.\u201cThank you for accompanying Shen Dai and Qiuqiu to the hospital. I\u2019ll take them to another hospital. You can go back to work.\u201dShen Dai silently packed up his things and then hugged Qiuqiu: \u201cZimei, you go back first. It\u2019s too much trouble for you today.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to have any conflict with Qu Moyu in the presence of Cheng Zimei. And not to mention, the most important thing now is to make Qiuqiu better.Cheng Zimei nodded uneasily, looking at the two of them, feeling dumbfounded.Shen Dai walked out of the ward with Qiuqiu in his arms. Qu Moyu took a few steps to his side and helped him block a parent who was pulling her child in the corridor with his shoulder.The calm ebony pheromone penetrated the clouds and mist like a sharp sword. It floated into Shen Dai\u2019s breath under the heavy sterilisation of the air. He couldn\u2019t help but smell the pheromone, at least at this moment, the smell gave him a little peace of mind.After getting into the car, the door closed, and the three adults held their breaths nervously, observing Qiuqiu\u2019s reaction.Maybe it was the fever that affected Qiuqiu\u2019s senses. He didn\u2019t cry because of Qu Moyu\u2019s presence. He didn\u2019t seem to notice it at all.This made Shen Dai even more worried, he said, \u201cLao Wu, please drive faster.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dQu Moyu looked at Qiuqiu\u2019s blushing face and became anxious: \u201cWhy did he have a fever?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll go to the hospital and have a good check. Don\u2019t worry, he will be well soon.\u201dShen Dai looked at Qiuqiu and whispered, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s my son. He\u2019s our son. He\u2019s in good health.\u201d Qu Moyu looked at Shen Dai who was looking at Qiuqiu. Compared with the confident and calm Shen Gong before, the person in front of him seemed to be trapped in a different body. The facial features clearly did not change, but it had become pale and had lost its\u2019 glow. But he still couldn\u2019t take his eyes off of him. He exudes a different glow now. Regardless of gender, there is only one unique radiance that an identity can radiate\u2014 the identity of parenting.He felt sorry for his omega. He just wanted to hold Shen Dai in his arms, to block all the wind and rain, and to heal all his pain.***Luxurious private hospitals are vastly different from public hospitals in terms of environment and experience. Coming here is not like seeing a doctor, but to enjoy services.Qiuqiu was assigned to the best ward. The doctors and full-time nurses immediately surrounded him to see and nurse him. The test results were the same as what the previous doctor had said. For a normal fever, it is best to take medicine and physically reduce the fever. The difference is that this place is quiet and clean. The nurses are not far away and Shen Dai\u2019s messy heart has calmed down. He is not so anxious and worried.Qiuqiu still fell asleep and cried sometimes. The nurse said: \u201cThe child is not feeling well. The mood is not good and it will also affect the speed of recovery. You can release more comfort pheromones to him, let him cry less, eat more and sleep more. With his physical strength returning, the fever will soon subside.\u201dShen Dai touched his bag, took out Bai Xiangwan\u2019s pheromone spray, and hesitated to use it. In fact, he had sprayed it a long time ago, but it didn\u2019t work. This substitute pheromone could only deceive young children by smell, but Qiuqiu\u2019s sense of smell was temporarily disabled. Humans\u2019 perception of pheromones is far more than just smell, but also involves the nervous system, blood system and endocrine system. So Qiuqiu can still get his pheromone to appease, but he can\u2019t get Bai Xiangwan\u2019s.Qu Moyu took away the almost empty spray bottle and threw it into the trash: \u201cLet me try it.\u201d He looked into Shen Dai\u2019s eyes with sincerity, \u201cI am his alpha father.\u201d\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.07.08\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: If QMY doesn\u2019t repent soon, I\u2019ll burn the forest next to my house. -KPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Qu Moyu had already walked straight to the crib. He stretched out his hand and lightly touched Qiuqiu\u2019s little fluffy head.It\u2019s so hot, he thought. The doctor said that it was just a normal fever and it would be fine if the temperature got lower. He also felt that it was not a big problem. No one had never fallen sick before. But looking at such a small and soft Qiuqiu with his face burning pink and he was panting with slight difficulty. The raised eyebrows kept twisting and twisting so he can imagine that Qiuqiu must be very uncomfortable. But the child can\u2019t speak yet, so he can only use crying to vent his discomfort.He suddenly felt heartbroken. Their child was experiencing the first pain in his life and it was also the first time he felt a kind of heartache that could not be replaced. As he cares more and more about Shen Dai, he also cares more and more about this child. Even if he didn\u2019t want the child at first and whether it is from the current perspective or the future consideration, the existence of this child should trouble him.But his mood has completely changed. He is fortunate that Shen Dai gave birth to Qiuqiu. After there is no marriage or mark between them, this child is the only bond between them that can never be erased.Qu Moyu bent down and supported the fence of the crib with both of his hands. He didn\u2019t know how to start. He had never held such a small child before. Qiuqiu looked too small. Not even the length of his forearm. How to pick it up? How to handle fragile things like this?Shen Dai watched from the side, wanted to stop him but also wanted Qu Moyu to try it. Right now, he only hoped that Qiuqiu would get better. It didn\u2019t matter whose pheromone he used. He couldn\u2019t compete on this kind of thing.After hesitating for a moment, Qu Moyu grabbed Qiuqiu\u2019s waist with both hands and the feeling surprised him a little. It was as if his legs were not as thick.Shen Dai reminded him: \u201cYou have to hold his neck first.\u201dQu Moyu understood. He put one hand on the back of Qiuqiu\u2019s neck and picked up the child, but he quickly got stuck on how to transfer the child into his arms, feeling awkward no matter how he held him.Shen Dai couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. He held Qiuqiu halfway with one hand and adjusted Qu Moyu\u2019s arm in place with the other, helping him hold Qiuqiu in the correct posture.This is the first time that Shen Dai has taken the initiative to approach and touch himself after their goodbye. Qu Moyu looked at Shen Dai\u2019s beautiful silhouette, pale skin, and long slender eyelashes. His heartbeat could not be stopped and there was also a hint of gloom. The fragrance of the ephemeral flowers was looming and he wasn\u2019t sure if he really smelt it, or if he was deluding himself because he wanted to smell it so much.Shen Dai quickly backed away and Qu Moyu looked down at the soft child in his arms. He looked light but was obviously quite weighty. It was as if he had completed an inexplicable mission the moment he picked him up.Qiuqiu twisted uncomfortably. His mouth shrivelled, but he didn\u2019t open his eyes.Qu Moyu carefully released a comforting pheromone. When he took the initiative to release pheromone, it was either because of competition or because of sex, and it was mostly aggressive. When he recalled carefully, he only used pheromone to appease two people, one was Shen Dai when he was in estrus, and the other was Qiuqiu. He patiently used his pheromone to sense Qiuqiu\u2019s pheromone. The pheromones of infants and young children contain a very weak smell. At this time, the smell of medicine can\u2019t be smelled. He saw in the medical record that Qiuqiu\u2019s pheromone is Longbai. He is very curious about the smell of Longbai and when Qiuqiu is ready, he will definitely take a good smell of it. He also wants to know more about this child and what he has missed since he was conceived to the present day to make up for the year that he had lost.Qiuqiu groaned even more uncomfortably at first, instinctively resisting the ebony pheromone that had once pressured and intimidated him. But he didn\u2019t have the strength to hide or cry. Gradually, he seemed to accept this pheromone. Or the genetic memory is awakened and the blood connection between father and son comes into play.Qu Moyu boldly released more pheromones and surrounded Qiuqiu with a rare tender emotion. Qiuqiu gradually calmed down. Even his two thick little eyebrows stretched and he began to sleep deeply while sucking his fingers.Qu Moyu was a little excited. He glanced at Shen Dai as if asking for credit, expecting Shen Dai to say something to compliment him.Shen Dai just breathed a sigh of relief: \u201cHe must be hungry. Can you watch him for a while? I\u2019m going to make milk powder for him.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201d Qu Moyu sat in the chair with Qiuqiu in his arms, watching Shen Dai getting busy not far away from him. He took out all kinds of baby items out from the babysitter bag he was carrying.Qu Moyu still remembered that when Shen Dai lived in his house, he always carried a black backpack back and forth from work. It was issued by the company in a certain year. Although it was ugly, it was durable. Some commonly used items are packed inside. There are not many things. He would just slap them on his shoulders, get on the bicycle and ride away, looking brisk and free and easy. Now, Shen Dai\u2019s carry-on bag is almost full of things that Qiuqiu needs to use, which are trivial and cumbersome.Shen Dai, whom he admires and likes, is an omega who is exceptionally outstanding in his career. He also has invaluable quietness and wisdom. Even if he later thinks that Shen Dai is plotting against him, that Shen Dai has done something stupid that is beyond his power, this person is in his heart still holds a special place. But now Shen Dai had lost its\u2019 glow. It\u2019s like the jewellery is dusty, anyone who sees it can\u2019t help but choke. He is forced to think about a question that he deliberately avoided \u2013 how did Shen Dai live this year?He knew that Shen Dai must have a bad life. A very bad one. But he instinctively avoided it. He wanted Shen Dai to come back to him. He would treat Shen Dai well. And everything would be fine.Shen Dai prepared the milk powder, tasted it a little to test the temperature, and brought it to Qiuqiu.Qiuqiu was holding the pacifier but he didn\u2019t suck very hard even though he was also trying hard to eat.Shen Dai smiled: \u201cIt\u2019s good that he has an appetite.\u201dQu Moyu poked Qiuqiu\u2019s face with his finger: \u201cGet well soon. Tossing your Dad like this.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s heart trembled. He used his imagination to raise the angle of view to really \u2018look at\u2019 the three of them. Qu Moyu was holding Qiuqiu and he was sitting on the side feeding Qiuqiu, as if they were among thousands of thousands of ordinary people in the world. A family of three. For more than a year, those unbearable past events have not stopped tormenting him for a day. But only at this moment, he was completely empty in this fleeting warm illusion.Qu Moyu stayed in the hospital for a day. He originally had an important meeting and a long-schedule of itinerary today, all of which were cancelled. It causes him to have calls almost every hour. He used to be very taboo about doing things that will affect his work for personal affairs. But now he doesn\u2019t want to leave the hospital, his omega or his sick child. At this time, people\u2019s psychological defence line is the most vulnerable and it will force people to think about many practical problems. Shen Dai\u2019s attitude finally eased and loosened so he must seize the opportunity.During this time, he also received a call from his father. He didn\u2019t want to accept it originally, but he thought that the board of directors meeting would be held tomorrow. If he doesn\u2019t accept it now, he will only face more blame tomorrow.Qu Shen called and urged him again to apologise to Zhou Xiaochu.\u201cHasn\u2019t he returned to France already?\u201d Qu Moyu asked impatiently.\u201cNot yet. He was frightened by you last time and his body hasn\u2019t recovered yet. Even if he returns to France, you should fly over to apologise to him. He is your fianc\u00e9e. You just left him alone. What kind of person would do that?\u201d\u201cFather, I think it\u2019s you who should really apologise.\u201d Qu Moyu said coldly, \u201cI made it clear that I would never \u2018mark\u2019 him. Why did you send him to my safe house? Do you know how dangerous it is? If I couldn\u2019t restrain myself at the time, he wouldn\u2019t end up only frightened now.\u201d It\u2019s not uncommon for alpha to injure, maim, or even kill an unwilling omega during the susceptible period.\u201cDo I need to repeat my thoughts to you again?\u201d Qu Shen said sternly, \u201cIt\u2019s more beneficial for you to \u2018mark\u2019 him. Don\u2019t hold your self-esteem as an S-class alpha and refuse to give a \u2018mark\u2019. Are you the emperor? As long as he can give birth to a few children for you, the best heir will always be selected.\u201dQu Moyu suppressed his anger: \u201cI don\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t accept anyone using pheromones to control me.\u201d S-class alphas are unwilling to give a \u2018mark\u2019, not only do they not want to be monopolised by the right to reproduce. But also because of their high self-esteem, they can\u2019t accept themselves being manipulated by an omega at the genetic level. Affecting their emotions and decision-making is an unimaginable state for them who are accustomed to control and essentially only believe in themselves. It will only cause unknown unease.\u201cWhat about being controlled or not? You are going to be husband and wife. Husband and wife are one heart. You give him a \u2018mark\u2019, he will be more loyal to you. And the Zhou family will fully support you. Now you are scaring him and you are at fault. Go to the door to apologise and coax him. What\u2019s wrong with that? he\u2019s your fianc\u00e9e!\u201d\u201cThen just break off the engagement.\u201dAfter Qu Moyu said these words, he was stunned. He seemed to blurt it out without thinking. But he also knew that he had been thinking about it for a long time. He clearly knew that he should marry Zhou Xiaochu, who was the best wife candidate carefully selected by his family. Marriage was a move he had to take. Naturally, there should be no reluctance. But the current situation is that reason tells him what to do. But he is still reluctant.He was reluctant to marry Zhou Xiaochu.Qu Shen was silent for a long time, then gritted his teeth and said, \u201cQu Moyu, what are you doing?!\u201dQu Moyu also remained silent. He was in a mess and couldn\u2019t sort out anything yet. The only certainty was that he didn\u2019t want to marry Zhou Xiaochu. He would wait until he was clear-headed to analyse the reason. But he couldn\u2019t do it now. His child is still in the ward behind him.\u201cIs it because of Shen Dai?\u201d During the susceptible period, he witnessed Qu Moyu\u2019s behaviour of using Shen Dai\u2019s clothes to build a nest. Qu Shen already had a bad premonition, but he still believed that his son would not be emotional.Qu Moyu said solemnly, \u201cDad, I have something to do. I\u2019ll talk about it tomorrow.\u201d\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.07.11\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: And let\u2019s just bid bye bye to Zhou Xiaochu\u2026hahahaha What a useless cannon fodder. -KPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The doors and windows in the ward were closed and the temperature dropped significantly.Shen Dai was only wearing a thin sweater. In fact, it was colder than it was now when he went out before dawn. But Qiuqiu was so hot that he completely ignored his own warmth and coldness. Only now he felt cold. He looked at his phone. After a while, the nurse will come to take Qiuqiu\u2019s temperature and he thinks Qiuqiu\u2019s temperature should be okay by then.Suddenly, a weight fell on his shoulders. He was surrounded by the cold woody fragrance and warm body temperature. The chill around him was suddenly isolated. He looked down and saw that it was Qu Moyu\u2019s suit jacket wrapped around him. The ebony wood pheromone concentration made him a little flustered.Qu Moyu sat down and took hold of Shen Dai\u2019s hand that wanted to take off his coat: \u201cWear it. You are wearing too little.\u201d He held Shen Dai\u2019s wrist and frowned. It was too thin. As if the clothes can easily be torn at any moment.Shen Dai withdrew his hand and silently looked at Qiuqiu who was sleeping. Qiuqiu seemed to be much more stable and it could be seen that his body was no longer uncomfortable.\u201cThe fever should be gone. But to be on the safe side, you should stay here for another night.\u201d Qu Moyu said, \u201cThere is almost everything here. You just need to tell the nurse.\u201dShen Dai nodded. The VIP ward where Qiuqiu stays now is more luxurious and comfortable than a five-star hotel. It is indeed safer to observe him for another night. He also doesn\u2019t want to bring Qiuqiu back to Cheng Zimei, so that Cheng Zimei can sleep well again.\u201cDon\u2019t stay in the hotel after you\u2019re discharged from the hospital. Let\u2019s move to the apartment you went to last time. Qiuqiu should live in a better environment.\u201dShen Dai slowly turned his head to look at Qu Moyu: \u201cI haven\u2019t stayed in that hotel for a long time. I\u2019m staying at Cheng Zimei\u2019s house now.\u201dQu Moyu was slightly startled.\u201cYou also said that you could go to the hotel to find me if you couldn\u2019t reach me through the phone.\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s face was very calm, \u201cSince you have started to monitor me, you must be clear about my resignation. Mr. Qu, put aside our relationship. Tell me, aren\u2019t you too cheap to make things difficult for an innocent employee like this?\u201dThe tension between the two of them finally eased up but now they were tense again. Qu Moyu frowned: \u201cI just hope to delay it so that you will have more time to make a decision instead of impulsively doing something that will affect the rest of your life.\u201d\u201cI have already made a decision since a year ago.\u201d\u201cAh Dai, look at Qiuqiu. This is the first time he gets sick. But it won\u2019t be the last time. Who will take care of him when you go to work? What kind of environment and educational resources will he get when he grows up? What kind of school, what kind of job will he do? Do you want him to be crowded into a messy public hospital ward in the future? Are you going to ignore him because you want to make money to support your family? He can\u2019t enjoy a good education and won\u2019t have a better space to play.\u201dQu Moyu is indeed a person who is very good at negotiating. At the negotiating table, he is aware of the other party\u2019s needs, weighs his own chips, and seeks to maximise his benefits. It is a pity that Shen Dai is not his business partner or competitor.Shen Dai said slowly: \u201cThe environment of public hospitals is a bit poor, but most of the people are cured there. And some people are picked up by drivers when they go to school, but children who take buses and electric cars will not die just because of a little rain. If I didn\u2019t grow well, my career was delayed for a year, it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t get up again. I have confidence in myself and I can give Qiuqiu a good life.\u201d He quietly stared at Qu Moyu, \u201cWe have different definitions of what is good. Your family is sitting on lavish wealth but didn\u2019t your parents ignore you? Your father was determined to make you the perfect heir. Your mother couldn\u2019t face you because of the loss of a child. You feel good having money, power, and constant pursuit of victory. But I don\u2019t think so. And I don\u2019t teach my kids that way.\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s complexion gradually darkened.\u201cYou think that if you give me money and a good material life, I should accept to be your mistress and let my son and I both carry this inferior status.\u201d Shen Dai laughed mockingly, \u201cYou don\u2019t see how wrong that is.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cMr. Qu.\u201d Shen Dai didn\u2019t give him a chance to speak, \u201cYou will think of me during the susceptible period and you will think that you \u2018like\u2019 me. It\u2019s just the side effect of the \u2018mark\u2019. No one will treat someone they \u2018like\u2019 the way you treated me. When you marry the right wife and \u2018mark\u2019 him, you won\u2019t need me anymore.\u201dQu Moyu looked at Shen Dai\u2019s clear and indifferent eyes. His chest felt tight and painful. The more he could not forget how Shen Dai looked at him with admiration, the more he could not bear the resistance and alienation from this person.That\u2019s right. His longing for Shen Dai was just a side effect of the \u2018mark\u2019 and he had told himself the same. But in the year before the susceptibility period, there was never a single day that he really forgot about Shen Dai. He was angry. He also missed and worried because of Shen Dai\u2019s departure. And then, the next year, he could no longer bear it. What else could he use to explain it? He can only rely on cognition and common sense to find a similar emotion in the mundane world \u2013 and that is \u2018liking\u2019 someone.He thinks that he could reject the generation of emotions. But, he is a human being after all. He however must control the impact of his emotions on his decision-making. He cannot allow Shen Dai, a person who can affect him, not be controlled by him. Whatever he needs, he must get it. And he needs Shen Dai.But Shen Dai refused him again and again. No matter what he did. No matter how much he knew. No matter what he promised. He was obviously just an omega with no ability to resist. Why can he be so stubborn and tough? This is making him restless and uncomfortable. He\u2019s about to lose his dignity!Shen Dai\u2019s influence on him was so great that he was afraid. How could he continue to let himself and Shen Dai go?At this moment, the nurse knocked on the door and came in.Shen Dai turned his face away and stood up at the same time.The nurse took Qiuqiu\u2019s temperature and said with a smile, \u201cSure enough. The fever has subsided. Did he just drink milk?\u201d\u201cYes, he did.\u201d\u201cThen he should be fine soon. After taking a few more meals, he will recover. That\u2019s how children are.\u201dShen Dai breathed a sigh of relief: \u201cThank you.\u201dThe nurse gave a few words of advice and then left the ward.Shen Dai took off Qu Moyu\u2019s coat and handed it to him: \u201cMr. Qu, you can go back first. I\u2019ll stay here with Qiuqiu for another night.\u201dQu Moyu looked at Shen Dai. His pupils were dark and heavy: \u201cI\u2019m here to accompany him too. My pheromone can appease Qiuqiu. He has accepted me.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s just sick. When he\u2019s healed, I won\u2019t bother you anymore.\u201d Shen Dai still kept raising his jacket with his hands up, with a dull expression, \u201cMr. Qu, thank you for today, Please go back.\u201dA sharp light flashed in Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes. He grabbed the coat and at the same time took advantage of his strength to drag Shen Dai towards him, hugging him tightly. The faint scent of epiphyllum permeating his heart. Qu Mo hugged him tight and didn\u2019t want to let go.Shen Dai was startled, but immediately remembered that Qiuqiu was still sleeping. He struggled and shouted: \u201cLet go!\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s arms were as hard as iron. He seemed to be trapped in a cramped cage. How can he be free? No matter how much he scolded and resisted, he still can\u2019t break free.\u201cAh Dai.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s voice was so low that it was hoarse, conveying an indescribable pain. \u201cDon\u2019t be so stubborn. You come back to me. Okay? We can be the same as before.\u201d He never pleaded as softly as this in his life. For him, this is already his greatest compromise.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be the same as before.\u201d To be the same as \u2018before\u2019 is where you enjoyed all the benefits and I took all the pain.Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes burst out with twisted pain and terrifying coldness. His limbs gradually became rigid. He let go of Shen Dai and finally took a deep look at his omega and his son. He then grabbed the coat and walked away without looking back.***Shen Dai slept on and off in the hospital for several hours. He would wake up whenever Qiuqiu moved.After taking his temperature in the morning and all is fine, Shen Dai took Qiuqiu away.When he returned to Cheng Zimei\u2019s house, Cheng Zimei had already gone to work. He put Qiuqiu away and started replying to Bai Xiangwan and Xiao Die\u2019s messages. Although they had been in contact for the past few days back in the capital, this time that Qiuqiu had a fever, he didn\u2019t want to tell them. He took pictures of Qiuqiu sleeping as usual and reported their safety.After a while, Bai Xiangwan called.Shen Dai knew that Bai Xiangwan must be calling to ask about his resignation. But after thinking about it, he could only tell the truth. With the taint of being fired in his career, his job search will definitely be frustrating. Employers can know everything. But as long as the employer doesn\u2019t care, it\u2019s not a problem for the time being.But Bai Xiangwan was still very indignant after listening to it: \u201cWhat kind of bastard logic is this? Didn\u2019t Qu Moyu approve the long sick leave? Why is he trying to embarrass you like this?\u201d\u201cThere is some unpleasantness between us.\u201d Shen Dai didn\u2019t want to continue the topic at all so he pretended to smile lightly, \u201cAnyway, I finally resigned. I still have some trivial matters to tend to and I will return to Lancheng in two days.\u201d He must see that Qiuqiu\u2019s condition is completely improved before he dares to fly again.\u201cOkay. If you have any difficulties, just tell me directly. The position here has been reserved for you.\u201d\u201cThank you, Senior Brother Bai.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be polite to me. Is Qiuqiu alright? I miss him a little.\u201d Bai Xiangwan smiled, \u201cI miss him being noisy and I\u2019m not used to not hearing him cry now.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s very good and he was very close to my grandma.\u201d Shen Dai smiled, \u201cHe must miss you and Xiao Die too.\u201dBai Xiangwan paused and said in a gentle voice, \u201cAh Dai, come home early.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s heart warmed: \u201cOkay.\u201dAfter hanging up the phone, Shen Dai began to plan his next move.He left in a hurry at the beginning and didn\u2019t bring many things with him. Since this time, he was really moving away, he still had to send some things off. He had to communicate with his grandma in advance and pick a time when Shen Qin was not at home to go back and pack his things. Grandma said that Shen Qin should have another boyfriend and he has been out a lot recently. But fortunately, Shen Qin took the money from Qu Chengchen and hired two nannies to take a look at his grandmother during his absence. Since grandma didn\u2019t want to go to Lancheng with him, he left the house for his grandmother to live in. It is so that he could feel a little more at ease.Leaving home is bound to be painful. But where he and Qiuqiu are, that is his home.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.07.12\u058d\u058d\u058dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His grandmother watched over the child. He spent a whole day packing out seven big boxes, most of which were books, materials, diaries, certificates of merit, as well as many paintings and handicrafts he and grandfather had made together.These old things carry a lot of memories. In fact, it is okay for him not to take them away. But the house is too small. In order to put his things, Shen Qin has placed a lot of Shen Dai\u2019s things that are important to him on the balcony. Maybe it will be thrown away directly. Obviously this is his house and obviously the grandfather he commemorates the paintings with is also Shen Qin\u2019s father. Sometimes he envies people like Shen Qin. Selfishness seems to be a hard requirement for a happy life. He has a low sense of morality and does not easily feel guilty towards others.It was getting dark after he had finished packing up. Shen Dai and the delivery company made an appointment to pick up the goods tomorrow morning. His grandmother asked the nanny to buy a lot of Shen Dai\u2019s favourite things to eat and she cooked a table of meals in person. He hadn\u2019t tasted his grandmother\u2019s craftsmanship in a long time. And he didn\u2019t know how many times he could eat it in the future. He was so emotional that he was close to crying.At night, he and Qiuqiu slept at the house. His room had already been occupied by Shen Qin and the room was filled with the fragrance of orange blossoms. When omega gets older, the smell of their pheromones will become weaker so they will choose to decorate themselves and their living space with fragrances of similar scent. This is not only a rescue measure when people face old age. It is also necessary for their own emotions and health.But he didn\u2019t like the scent since he was a child. It\u2019s not quite accurate to say that. Of course, he has deeply relied on the orange blossom pheromone, just like Qiuqiu relied on his pheromone. But after he was a little sensible, after countless attempts to get close to his father and only being returned with indifference, he gradually didn\u2019t like orange blossoms. Although he was still young and ignorant, he realised that his father didn\u2019t like him. Now, because of his disgust towards Shen Qin, he even felt disgusted by the scent.As if he could feel it, Qiuqiu didn\u2019t seem to like it either. So he refused to sleep. Shen Dai took him to the well-ventilated living room, walked him around and coaxed him for an hour, and then only he fell asleep. After a busy day, Shen Dai was too tired to straighten up and he soon fell asleep too.The next morning, Shen Dai got up early to make small wontons for his grandmother. She got up early too. She didn\u2019t care about eating so she went to feed Qiuqiu and was amused by any of Qiuqiu\u2019s actions from time to time. Shen Dai had not been in such an atmosphere for a long time. He hasn\u2019t experienced it before and he feels a lot of reluctance in his heart.After breakfast, an unfamiliar phone call came in. Shen Dai thought it was the delivery service but when he answered the phone, he heard a familiar voice.\u201cShen Gong, hello. Do you still remember me? I\u2019m attorney Chen Wei.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s heart skipped a beat and he had a bad premonition. He was silent for a few seconds: \u201cI remember. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cIs it convenient for you to meet with me? There are some things that need to be discussed.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s inconvenient.\u201d\u201cShen Gong, this matter has something to do with your child, Shen Yue. It\u2019s very important. I hope you\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat does Qu Moyu want this time?\u201d Shen Dai gritted his teeth.\u201cWhere are you now? Shall I go to find you?\u201d Facing Shen Dai\u2019s anger, Attorney Chen was still calm, \u201cPlease believe me. This meeting is very important for you and your child. If you insist on not seeing me, you eventually have to see Mr. Qu. I think it would be better if you communicate with me first.\u201dShen Dai only felt that his chest was heavy and it was difficult for him to calm down for a while. He didn\u2019t know what he was going to face. Qu Moyu\u2019s various behaviours were like a huge net being thrown on him. Where could he hide?Half an hour later, Shen Dai met Attorney Chen at a small cafe near his house.Judging from Attorney Chen\u2019s obviously prosperous posture, he must have had a very fulfilling year this year. It is his job to handle legal affairs for the company, but being able to handle the boss\u2019s private affairs most likely means that he will become the number one legal person for the future of the group.Attorney Chen still smiled decently and deliberately looked behind Shen Dai, which probably meant he was looking for his \u2018child\u2019.Shen Dai had no intention of explaining things to him. After sitting down, he said with a blank face, \u201cAttorney Chen, please tell me whatever you have to say.\u201dAttorney Chen held his briefcase and took out a stack of papers from it. He nodded to Shen Dai gently, even respectfully: \u201cShen Gong, although I am an outsider, I have also witnessed the relationship between you and Mr. Qu all the way. The arrival of this child\u2026\u201d\u201cAttorney Chen.\u201d Shen Dai didn\u2019t want to bother with any unimportant matters and interrupted him, \u201cSpeak straight if you have something to say.\u201dAttorney Chen was not embarrassed. He began to perform basic operations \u2013 digging out documents. Then he put both hands on the table, showing a sincere smile that can be called pleasing: \u201cShen Gong, Mr. Qu has done a paternity test with Shen Yue to prove that Shen Yue is his biological son.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s face changed suddenly: \u201cWhat do you mean? When did I agree to do a paternity test? What does he want?!\u201dAt that time, Qiuqiu was required to do some examinations in the hospital and of course blood was drawn. But as Qiuqiu\u2019s guardian, if he did not agree, anyone doing a paternity test without authorization would have no legal effect.\u201cWhen Shen Yue was hospitalised, you signed some relevant documents. Maybe you were anxious and didn\u2019t read it carefully\u2026\u201dShen Dai slapped the table hard and leaned forward unconsciously.Attorney Chen immediately sat up straight and moved back an inch quietly. He looked at Shen Dai\u2019s fierce expression of gnashing his teeth. He didn\u2019t expect that one day he would be frightened by an omega\u2019s aura.\u201cYou guys will play this kind of game, right?\u201d Shen Dai said sharply, \u201cWhat does he want to do?!\u201dAttorney Chen straightened his clothes and said cautiously, \u201cMr. Qu wants the custody of Shen Yue.\u201dShen Dai felt like he was struck by lightning and froze on the spot.\u201cThe consent form for the paternity test was signed by you and it is evidenced by the surveillance video of the hospital. If you think you signed it involuntarily, you can sue him. I have your medical records here to prove that the child was in his hospital. If you are pregnant with Mr. Qu during the marriage, although considering that Shen Yue is still an infant, the custody judgement is usually more inclined towards you. But the lawsuit itself is not good for you. You have no financial resources, physical strength, and mentality. You don\u2019t even have any income now.\u201d Attorney Chen spread out Shen Dai\u2019s disadvantages one by one, like opening a fish, and then pulling out all the internal organs.Shen Dai was trembling all over. The huge malice was so overwhelming that he could hardly breathe.Seeing Shen Dai\u2019s appearance of being emptied of his soul, Attorney Chen couldn\u2019t bear it. He repeated \u201cYou should just accept the benefits given by Mr. Qu to avoid disasters\u201d. He then sighed softly: \u201cShen Gong, Mr. Qu is not here so let me tell you something. Let\u2019s talk from the side of the laws and regulations. Your current situation has no advantages at all. Apart from what I said just now, you also had signed a prenuptial agreement but giving birth to Mr. Qu\u2019s child is a breach of contract. The amount of compensation is outrageous. And also, do you remember that you are now the legal representative of a subsidiary of Chuanghai? As long as you think about it, you can carry a debt of 100 million yuan with just a little operation. Why do you have to piss Mr. Qu off and provoke him?\u201dShen Dai clenched his hands into fists. His short nails pierced into the flesh with a force. He is exchanging pain for a price of sobriety. He glared at Attorney Chen fiercely and asked angrily, \u201cWhat did I piss him off with? What does he want? He wanted divorce? We have divorced. He wanted me to wash off the \u2018mark\u2019? I have washed off the \u2018mark\u2019. Didn\u2019t he not want any children with me? So I left my hometown and I never intend to let him know about this child in my life. I am afraid of him. I had obeyed him. I know that I can\u2019t fight with him. So do I dare to provoke him?\u201d\u201cHey, these emotional matters\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is no relationship between us!\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s heart was full of hatred, \u201cHe has no feelings. He only has unbelievably big pride and he has to get whatever he wants. In his eyes, neither I nor my child are human!\u201dThey are just some tools to meet Qu Moyu\u2019s needs.Attorney Chen lowered his head and pondered for a moment. He then said in a low voice, \u201cShen Gong, maybe you are right. But it doesn\u2019t change anything. After a few contacts, it can be seen that you are a very stubborn person with a clear distinction between love and hatred. In fact, with Mr. Qu, you can slowly show your weakness to him. If you let him take a step forward towards you, he won\u2019t have to come up with this strategy. Life is full of reluctance. Think of the word \u2018resignation\u2019. I think there is great wisdom in it. You should give it a try.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s eyes were red and the muscles on his face twitched slightly. He is full of anger and pain.Attorney Chen rubbed his brows helplessly and said warmly, \u201cYou are still young. So let me share some sociological viewpoints with you. The S-class alphas are very animalistic in their bones. They only wear the cloak of civilization on the outer part of their skin. Many of normal people\u2019s logic cannot work with them. They seem to be very intelligent and inhumane. That is their way of hunting. So they must understand the prey and the predation environment. In their eyes, life is a big hunting game. Everything else in the world is their prey. You stop him from doing a certain thing, making him unhappy, you are his enemy. And he will use the same way to deal with the enemy in order to deal with you, to conquer you, and to do whatever he wants with you. This is their stress response when they are in a state of battle for a long time. When they feel hurt, they will only act instinctively. That is one move \u2013 to fight back. Instead of communicating, compromising, explaining misunderstandings, and understanding each other like ordinary people.\u201d Lawyer Chen shook his head, \u201cFew people can get through their closed up emotions. If they didn\u2019t receive enough love when they were growing up, it\u2019s hard for them to give love in return in their life. Plus, the way many people educate S-class alphas is to make them become unemotional machines that pursue power and profit. This is why most S-class alphas are reluctant to give \u2018mark\u2019. On the surface, it is pride. But deep down, it is actually fear. It is for fear that the law of the jungle on which they had lived on will be overturned.\u201dShen Dai looked at Attorney Chen and his eyes looked even more empty.\u201cAlthough it\u2019s unreasonable, it\u2019s such a pity. Because they are too powerful.

How he used to admire that S-class alpha from afar, how to restrain himself but couldn\u2019t help himself from approaching him, and how he got to this point of hating him wholeheartedly now. He was thinking of how Qu Moyu changed from a saviour to a perpetrator. He was walking down the altar with a halo only to later reveal his hideous and terrible true face.He couldn\u2019t help but think about where he went wrong? Was it in the things he had said or in the things he had done? Had he made all the wrong choices until he fell into the current predicament? It was just like summing up all of his experiences and lessons after countless failed experiments. He repeatedly scrutinised and verified the \u2018data\u2019 he collected. But from the bottom of his heart, he does not believe that the failures he has experienced can lead to success. Because there has never been any kind of failure that turned him into ashes in an instant.He just fell in love with the wrong person. And now, will he suffer from retribution?He really hoped that his life could be temporarily fixed here to give him enough time to think. Because he found that he had nothing else but a smart mind. It was no wonder Qu Moyu could play with him at will.The waiter who came to add water was hit with Shen Dai\u2019s empty and dazed eyes. Both of them were startled. The waiter was frightened by Shen Dai\u2019s pale face and gloomy eyes: \u201cAre you alright?\u201dShen Dai came back to his senses: \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d He quickly put those papers into the document folder. They are indeed shameful things. A proof of his stupidity, incompetence and shame.Shen Dai walked out of the cafe and looked at a familiar commercial car across the street. When Attorney Chen left, he told him that a car would be waiting for him. And when he made up his mind, he would be picked up to see Qu Moyu.This car once took him to the primary school where Qu Moyu used to study at. The two of them ate together at a small noodle restaurant that carried Qu Moyu\u2019s childhood memories and then walked and chatted on the street holding hands. The moment of Qu Moyu opening up his heart to him was the warmest life scene between them. It was more passionate than their touches.But that was just his wishful thinking.The reality ripped apart all the dreams he had ever had. It left him with a mess that he had to clean up.Shen Dai got into the car. The driver was also the driver of the Qu family. After greeting him politely, he started the car. He didn\u2019t say where he was going and Shen Dai also didn\u2019t ask.The route that the car took was familiar. The car was headed towards the Qu\u2019s house. When he finally saw the familiar garden gate, Shen Dai\u2019s fist clenched.Before the car stopped, Shen Dai had already seen Uncle Heng and Aunt Lan standing at the door.Before the driver could open the door for him, Shen Dai opened the door and got out of the car. He and the two old friends looked at each other. Each pair of eyes was complicated and deep.Uncle Heng greeted in a low voice, \u201cMr. Shen.\u201dAunt Lan frowned. Her eyes are slightly red.Shen Dai nodded towards them and walked into the house.Hearing the movement, Qu Moyu came down from upstairs. The leather slippers should have not made a sound under slight footstep. But the sound of kicking and stepping was obviously a little rapid. It was not until the moment when he saw Shen Dai himself that he slowed down his pace. He walked seemingly calm down the stairs.The house doesn\u2019t seem to have changed from when he left it more than a year ago. Qu Moyu is a man with a strong desire to control. Even at home, he has a set of standards. It\u2019s still the same. Shen Dai, who stayed here temporarily because of an agreed marriage, was always reminded by others to keep a distance from Qu Moyu. At that time, he thought that it was a destined fate that he and Qu Moyu were involved again and again. But he didn\u2019t expect that catastrophe often disguises with a beautiful appearance.Qu Moyu looked at Shen Dai as if he had lost his soul. He felt unbearable in his heart. This may be his last resort, but it was only because he had no other choice. He walked in front of Shen Dai, his eyes dodging unconsciously: \u201cWhere\u2019s Qiuqiu?\u201dShen Dai\u2019s eyes were filled with murderous intent. He suddenly threw the document folder in his hand at Qu Moyu. And when everyone was astonished, he punched Qu Moyu in the face.Qu Moyu was beaten and staggered. He took a few steps back. He tilted his head, maintaining the inertial direction after receiving the force, with surprise, anger, and sadness in his eyes.Uncle Heng and the others were all startled and dumbfounded as they were stunned on the spot.They have never seen their young master suffer from any physical attack. The S-class alpha is naturally much stronger than ordinary people. And not to mention, this is in his own home.Qu Moyu\u2019s embarrassed face was flushed red. His jawline was tense and his Adam\u2019s apple rolled up and down slowly. It was as if he was swallowing something that was difficult to chew. As an alpha, he was beaten by his own omega in front of all the servants in his family. He quickly thought back to the past and could not find any other more embarrassing scene in his life. He slowly turned his face and looked at Shen Dai. His eyes were cloudy and deep. They were sparkling with anger. But his pheromones didn\u2019t have big waves. They were suppressed. But what rose was an emotion that seemed to be called \u2018grievance\u2019.Uncle Heng was the first to react. He waved his hand to tell everyone to evacuate. In just a few seconds, there were only two people left in the huge living room.Qu Moyu touched his hot cheeks. His voice was low and oppressive: \u201cThe last time I was beaten was when I was twelve years old.\u201d At that time, he didn\u2019t have the ability to control his pheromones as an adult alpha. Getting into fights with his classmates almost became a nuisance. It was a big disaster. Since then, he has not done anything to anyone. It was not to protect himself, but to protect others. When he spoke, his eyes never left looking at Shen Dai\u2019s face. That face was full of hatred, pain, and despair. Just looking at it was enough to make him hurt. \u201cAre you happy? If it\u2019s not enough, you can hit more.\u201dShen Dai stared at him with his scarlet eyes and said through gritted teeth, \u201cQu Moyu, you are a beast!\u201dQu Moyu was slightly startled. Shen Dai never scolded him even when he was most emotional. He thought that it was because he didn\u2019t dare. Him saying he \u2018hates him\u2019 and \u2018go away\u2019 was already the strongest resistance an omega could express against an S-class alpha. At that time, Shen Dai refrained from refusing, resisted in a roundabout way, and was careful not to provoke him. Although he couldn\u2019t understand Shen Dai\u2019s physical obedience to his will, he was used to it. As being at the top of the food chain, he was used to other people trembling at his feet all his life.Shen Dai was completely irritated because he touched his bottomline \u2013 his child.Isn\u2019t that exactly what he wanted? To catch someone, you have to catch the key points. But facing Shen Dai\u2019s censure and hatred directly made him feel so uncomfortable that he almost couldn\u2019t breathe.Shen Dai\u2019s handsome face was hideous and distorted at the moment, waving his fists and roaring: \u201cHow shameless you are. You actually want to take away my child! You didn\u2019t want him in the beginning. I worked so hard to give birth to him. You! What qualifications do you have to call yourself his father? What have you ever done for him?! I will never give you custody of Qiuqiu!\u201dQu Moyu lowered his eyes dejectedly. His heart was gripped fiercely. Any difficulties he had faced in his life seemed to be inferior to the powerlessness he felt that the omega in front of him gave him. He took a deep breath and turned towards Shen Dai. He took a step closer.Qu Moyu\u2019s original intention was to appease him. But Shen Dai was like a frightened rabbit. He had already blown up his entire body, vowing to protect his descendants to the death, but he couldn\u2019t resist the fear of beasts deep in his genes. So he took a step back.He was afraid. But he still forced himself to look directly at Qu Moyu.However, Qu Moyu avoided those eyes several times with a guilty conscience. He pretended to be calm and said, \u201cWhat I want is not Qiuqiu. I want you.\u201dShen Dai stared at Qu Moyu. His lips trembled slightly.\u201cI\u2019ve tried to discuss with you, apologised to you, analysed the pros and cons for you, and gave you all kinds of promises. But you refused me.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s face was covered with a mask, blocking all the turbulent emotions, \u201cI can only resort to this.\u201dShen Dai was so angry with the robber\u2019s logic that he was speechless.\u201cAh Dai, I have to get what I want. If you were more compromising, we wouldn\u2019t have to go this far.\u201dShen Dai roared: \u201cI\u2019m a human! I have my own will. I don\u2019t want to be with you. Why do you have to force me?!\u201d\u201cWe think differently.\u201d Qu Moyu listened to every word Shen Dai had said clearly. It turned into a knife and plunged into his heart. The blood flowed like a stream. He stared at Shen Dai, but his tone was surprisingly gentle, \u201cYou can choose to bring Qiuqiu back to me. Or I will get Qiuqiu\u2019s custody and allow you to take care of him. The result will be the same.\u201dHe gave Shen Dai his utmost patience and compromise. But he still couldn\u2019t get what he wanted. The only option left to him was to threaten him. He could never let Shen Dai leave him. Since he wanted this person so desperately, he should tie him right by his side. Conquest always makes people feel at ease. He will no longer worry about his heart or think about it day and night. He will no longer be pinched by an omega and unable to extricate himself, wandering in pain like a beast during the susceptible period. That kind of dying-like longing and the despair of not getting what he wants. He can never experience it a second time in his life.As for the means and process of getting it, it doesn\u2019t matter. The most important thing is to achieve the goal. Anything he wants in this life follows the same principle.Shen Dai\u2019s heart hurts as if it was crushed. His eyes are hot and there\u2019s a warm liquid flowing down his face.Qu Moyu frowned and looked at Shen Dai\u2019s tears. He stretched out his hand to wipe them for Shen Dai, but his omega ducked, avoiding him like a plague. His hands are left hanging in the air like his empty heart. He put down his hand, clenched it secretly, and said ruthlessly: \u201cWhere is Qiuqiu? You go and pick him up now. He is no longer allowed to use Bai Xiangwan\u2019s pheromones from now on. You are my omega. He is my son. As long as you are obedient, I promise to be good to you.\u201dShen Dai closed his eyes. Not because he wanted to trap himself in the darkness. But it was because the darkness had surrounded him.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.07.14\u058d\u058d\u058dTranslator\u2019s Note: the latest RAW chapter (Chapter 130) is soooo long\u2026. -KPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But Shen Dai seemed to be taken out of time, with his head against the car window. He didn\u2019t respond for a long time.When the car stopped downstairs, Shen Dai looked at the familiar unit door, thinking that the old woman and child he wanted to protect were all here. He suddenly came back to his senses. He grabbed Aunt Lan\u2019s hand and begged: \u201cAunt Lan, can you help me contact Madam Qu and ask her to help me?\u201dAunt Lan looked at Shen Dai sympathetically and said helplessly, \u201cMadam can\u2019t help you now. When the young master was emotionally overwhelmed, he had a big quarrel with the old man at the company the day before yesterday. He would listen to no one now.\u201dShen Dai looked at Aunt Lan with pleading eyes.\u201cAh Dai, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to help you. The young master\u2019s temper is very scary. Now is not the time. I can only help you by coming back to stay with you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Coming back?\u201d\u201cI was just called back from my hometown by the young master.\u201d Aunt Lan sighed, \u201cLast year, I quietly called Madam to come and the young master was very angry with me. Although he didn\u2019t drive me away, I was embarrassed so I retired. In fact, I miss the young master very much. After all, he was brought up by me. That day, the young master asked me to come back to take care of your child. So I came back right away.\u201dShen Dai couldn\u2019t open his mouth to beg her anymore. He whispered, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve troubled you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that. I don\u2019t regret it at all.\u201d Aunt Lan held Shen Dai\u2019s hand and clapped, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it just for you. I did it for the young master and Madam as well. I don\u2019t want the young master to regret it later. Madam actually needs such an opportunity to. Hmm\u2026 how to say? At least for Madam, being able to save this child is a redemption for her.\u201dShen Dai said in a trembling voice, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to have anything to do with him. Let alone let Qiuqiu get close to him.\u201dAunt Lan sighed again and murmured, \u201cWhy is this happening?\u201dLao Wu also cast a complicated look through the rearview mirror.Shen Dai resigned and got out of the car. He stood there for several minutes before adjusting his expression and going upstairs to pick up Qiuqiu.His grandmother and the nanny had been with Qiuqiu for a long time. Qiuqiu had already cried twice because he couldn\u2019t see Shen Dai. Almost as soon as he entered the house, he heard Qiuqiu\u2019s excited and urgent screams. The little nose was really good at smelling.The nanny sent Qiuqiu into Shen Dai\u2019s arms. Qiuqiu held onto Shen Dai\u2019s shirt and arched it back and forth, rubbing his saliva on his sleeve, as if expressing his dissatisfaction.Shen Dai reluctantly pretended to be fine and made up a reason why he went out in the morning and came back in the afternoon. He also made up the reason for why the moving truck for the things that he had packed all day yesterday would not come for the time being.His grandmother was already exhausted by Qiuqiu, so she didn\u2019t ask too many questions. Shen Dai followed his grandmother into her bedroom and watched her lay down to sleep. The two chatted for a while, before he took Qiuqiu\u2019s daily necessities and left.Aunt Lan, who saw Qiuqiu for the first time, was also very fond of him.Shen Dai always felt that Qiuqiu seemed to be able to distinguish his own preferences and then decide whether he liked that person or not based on his own father\u2019s preferences. This is always the case every time he sees a stranger. Is alpha naturally so sensitive? If this is the case, Qiuqiu will always resist Qu Moyu. How can he let Qiuqiu live in an environment he doesn\u2019t like?Shen Dai looked down at Qiuqiu. His innocent eyes were full of curiosity and ignorance about this world. Qiuqiu might never know what he went through from conception to birth and he almost couldn\u2019t be given birth. That opportunity is now used as a bargaining chip to blackmail him. He bit his lower lip secretly. No one is allowed to take his child away. No one.When they returned to Qu\u2019s house, it was already dark. But the whole villa was brightly lit, as if waiting to welcome some important guests.Shen Dai didn\u2019t get out of the car. From here, he could only see Uncle Heng and others waiting by the door, but he knew that Qu Moyu would definitely be in the living room. Even if he knew that he stepped into this house, it would be impossible to avoid that person, but his whole will was resisting against him. He whispered to Aunt Lan: \u201cAunt Lan, there are so many people. Qiuqiu will be afraid.\u201d\u201cOh, then let\u2019s go to the underground garage and take the elevator directly upstairs. The room is already tidied up.\u201dLao Wu turned his head and drove down the garage slope on the other side of the garden.Shen Dai carried Qiuqiu upstairs. As soon as the elevator door opened, he saw the familiar guest room at the end of the corridor. Back then, when he was \u2018staying\u2019 at Qu\u2019s house, it was this guest room that he had stayed in. He seemed to have made a big circle and returned to the starting point. But everything had changed.When he walked into the room, there was a small bed next to the bed he once slept on. There were also many baby products in the room. There were several brands of baby milk powder and diapers. There were even some child\u2019s necessities that were not for a small baby such as Qiuqiu. This was obviously a mess purchased in a tight time where they think that it is better to buy more than to have a shortage of stuff.Aunt Lan explained: \u201cWe still don\u2019t know what Qiuqiu usually eats and uses, so we prepared some in advance. Oh, you have all the things you used to use before here too. The young master has hired two childcare nannies and a special nutritionist for you. They will be on duty tomorrow. In the past few days, there were also some renovations done at home for it to be suitable for young children. You can tell Aunt Lan what you and Qiuqiu need and what you want me to do for you.\u201dShen Dai stood by the door and looked at all this with a dull expression. It was as if everything had nothing to do with him but tightly bound his limbs to the place. He was trapped and so was his child.There was a sound of footsteps behind him and Shen Dai suddenly felt a chill down his back. He didn\u2019t even want to turn back.Qu Moyu walked in and watched Shen Dai lowered his head with his back to him. A long and fair neck was exposed from the collar. The flesh-colored pheromone sticker was pasted on the back of the neck. He stared at Shen Dai\u2019s neck, opened his mouth and said: \u201cIf you need anything else, Uncle Heng will prepare it for you in the shortest possible time.\u201dUncle Heng nodded and stared at Qiuqiu.Qu Moyu took a deep breath, walked in front of Shen Dai, and tentatively looked at Qiuqiu.Qiuqiu rolled his two big black eyes and looked left and right, curious about the new environment. When he met Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes, he was stunned. His saliva overflowed from the corner of his mouth and the room was silent for like ten years. After a few seconds, Qiuqiu\u2019s humming sound came, as if he was hesitating whether to cry or not.Shen Dai hugged Qiuqiu and walked to the window, away from Qu Moyu. It was almost the farthest position on the diagonal. He whispered, \u201cYou guys go out first.\u201dQu Moyu wanted to approach but he didn\u2019t dare. He glanced at Shen Dai\u2019s nanny bag and couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cYou take Bai\u2026\u201d In front of other people, he really didn\u2019t have the face to mention another alpha\u2019s name. So he asked, \u201cYou also brought the substitute pheromone?\u201dShen Dai didn\u2019t look at him directly: \u201cGo out.\u201dQu Moyu said to Uncle Heng, \u201cYou guys go out first.\u201dUncle Heng and Aunt Lan had to withdraw themselves.When there were only two people left in the room, Qu Moyu said warmly, \u201cAh Dai, when Qiuqiu was sick last time, he had already accepted my pheromone. Give us some time. He will definitely remember that I am his alpha father.\u201d As he said that, he walked over.\u201cDon\u2019t come here.\u201d Shen Dai raised his head and stared at Qu Moyu with both hatred and fear in his eyes.Qu Moyu looked at his omega and his child huddled in the corner. Shen Dai\u2019s eyes were like a knife piercing through his heart. They were a family and should live happily under the same roof. But his wife and child were so resistant towards him. He doesn\u2019t even have the qualifications to approach now?! He took a deep breath to relieve the tightness in his chest and he whispered, \u201cQiuqiu should adapt to me. He doesn\u2019t need a substitute pheromone.\u201d\u201cHe never needed you.\u201d Shen Dai raised his elbow slightly and turned the back of Qiuqiu\u2019s head to him, preventing him from looking at Qu Moyu, \u201cGo out.\u201dSeeing that Shen Dai\u2019s spirit was stretched to the limit, Qu Moyu didn\u2019t dare to say anything more. He watched the two of them silently for a while and only left a sentence \u201crest early\u201d towards him. He then opened the door and left.Shen Dai sat down on the sofa as if he was exhausted. He sat there for a long time before burying his face into Qiuqiu\u2019s small chest and silently shed tears.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.07.15\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: QMY is still calling SD his wife.

They quickly understood Qiuqiu\u2019s character and the main points of daily nursing and quickly gained his trust.However, the baby rejected the pheromone of the alpha father, but used a substitute pheromone. It was a situation they had never seen before and it was a lot of trouble. Seeing the boss beside them with a dark face, he asked if they could help Qiuqiu get used to his pheromones as soon as possible. They didn\u2019t dare to ask the reason in detail and they had no similar experience. So they could only say perfunctorily that the child needed a period of transition.\u201cTransition? How long is the transition?\u201d When Qu Moyu thought that Bai Xiangwan\u2019s pheromone smell would appear in his home, on his wife and child, he didn\u2019t want to bear it for another minute. But he couldn\u2019t force Qiuqiu to quit. Even if he has never raised a child, he knows how necessary parental pheromones are for infants and young children.This must be the most fucking useless thing he\u2019s ever encountered in his life!\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say, Mr. Qu.\u201d The parenting sister-in-law smiled awkwardly. \u201cYou first let him accept you step by step. After all, you are his biological father. I believe that more interaction will awaken his genetic memory.\u201dShen Dai didn\u2019t say a word. But he thought about how to make Qiuqiu not adapt to Qu Moyu\u2019s pheromone. It can be seen from Qiuqiu\u2019s fever that the power of genes is too powerful. As the parenting sister-in-law said, as long as they get along for a long time, Qiuqiu will \u2018recognize\u2019 his real alpha father sooner or later. If one day Qiuqiu starts to rely on Qu Mo Yu\u2019s pheromone, how could he take Qiuqiu away?Qu Moyu said reluctantly: \u201cOkay. You can get back to work.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d The two left the study. They were going to organise their personal belongings for when they stayed there later.Shen Dai was also leaving.\u201cAh Dai.\u201d Qu Moyu stood up and grabbed Shen Dai\u2019s wrist, \u201cQiuqiu is sleeping. Please accompany me.\u201dShen Dai couldn\u2019t pull his hand back, so he could only let himself be pulled.Qu Moyu hugged Shen Dai\u2019s waist from behind, rubbed his delicate cheeks with his nose, and sniffed Shen Dai\u2019s glands close at hand: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to work so hard to take care of Qiuqiu in the future. And you don\u2019t have to wake up at night. They will take good care of the child and you can do what you want.\u201dShen Dai was silent.Qu Moyu kissed Shen Dai\u2019s neck, feeling that the body of the person in his arms was only a thin piece and he felt very uncomfortable: \u201cYou have lost a lot of weight. You must have suffered a lot this year. I will make good compensation for you. Okay? You need to take care of your body first. After a while, when you have recovered, you can go back to work in the research institute. If you want to continue working with Professor Liu, or do your own research, I will support you.\u201dHearing the research institute, Shen Dai\u2019s expression moved and his heart tightened.He remembered that ten years ago, when he had just stepped into his profession, he heard the famous name of Xingzhou Group. There are several institutions in each industry, which are the yearning for everyone\u2019s career. Being able to be selected into Xingzhou\u2019s talent plan and working in the Rare Earth Research Institute means high salary, reputation, stability, and a broad space for development. Even if there was a sudden change at home, when he had to work extra to support his family, he did not give up his internship, which only paid him about 1,500 yuan a month. During those days, he was full of exhaustion and anxiety. In the end, he survived and successfully stayed in the institute. He still remembers the day he got the hard-won offer, he hid in the toilet and cried happily.He thought he would always do this satisfying job, follow his mentor, build a decent life while pursuing academic ideals. This job is too important to him, but there are more important people in his life. He had to give them up. There is not a day when he doesn\u2019t want to still work in the research institute but now he does not dare and does not want to go back.He didn\u2019t know how to go back calmly.There are mixed rumours flying all over the sky. Everyone will know that he is Qu Moyu\u2019s mistress and he gave birth to Qu Moyu\u2019s child by means they could only guess with. With this background, he can come and go freely at will. He can even be on an equal footing with his former mentor and start his own subject, even if he is not qualified at all.He can already imagine how others will view him, talk about him, despise and envy him, look down on him and try to flatter him. The saddest thing is that most of those rumours are true.He has always longed to be ignored by gender and prove his strength through personal struggles, achievements, fame, awards, and even change the world and make a name for himself. What can be done or what can\u2019t be done, will eventually be attributed to \u2018because he is Qu Moyu\u2019s mistress\u2019.When Qu Moyu saw Shen Dai\u2019s reaction, he thought he had found something that could impress Shen Dai. So he said, \u201cDo you have any topics you want to do? I remember your new SCI article is about a kind of new training idea. Do you want to do in-depth research on this? I\u2019ll assign you a driver and then I\u2019ll give you an office with a lunch break. In the future, you can\u2026\u201dShen Dai whispered, \u201cNo need.\u201d He pushed Qu Moyu away.Qu Moyu looked at the indifferent Shen Dai, unable to hide his disappointment: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Don\u2019t you want to go back to the institute?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not suitable.\u201d Shen Dai lowered his head, \u201cCan I go now?\u201dShen Dai\u2019s attitude often made Qu Moyu uncomfortable. He said solemnly, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThis will also be your room in the future. You will sleep with me.\u201dShen Dai suddenly raised his head and stared at Qu Moyu: \u201cI want to share a room with Qiuqiu.\u201d\u201cQiuqiu has two nannies to take care of him in shifts. He won\u2019t disturb your sleep time in the future. That room will be turned into his baby room.\u201d Qu Moyu took a step forward and wrapped his arms around Shen Dai\u2019s waist again, preventing him from staying away from himself, \u201cYou will have enough time with our child. But you will also accompany me.\u201d He slowly leaned down.Shen Dai pressed against Qu Moyu\u2019s chest, only to feel that his hands were starting to heat. He couldn\u2019t stop Qu Moyu from lowering his head and kissing his lip and at the same time releasing a trapping pheromone to him. Shen Dai could only struggle a little and then softened his legs under the invasion of the powerful alpha pheromone.Qu Moyu sucked on Shen Dai\u2019s lips gently. He then licked his lips with the tip of his tongue, pushed open his teeth, and drove straight in to hook the dodging tongue. At first, Qu Moyu kissed with restraint and tenderness. But the more he kissed, the deeper and rougher he became. He picked up Shen Dai and put him on the desk, fixed the slender back of his neck, and poured his strong thoughts and turbulent desires into this kiss.The kiss was so deep and long that Shen Dai was almost breathless. In his trance, the pheromone sticker on the back of his neck was torn off. Qu Moyu massaged the glands with his warm palm and used his alpha pheromone to induce him to release the Epiphyllum fragrance.Shen Dai\u2019s glands have become less sensitive since the surgery to wash the \u2018mark\u2019 and because of his pregnancy, he has not been in heat for more than a year. Sometimes, he forgets his second gender. When Qu Moyu tries to wake up the erotic function of the glands, his memory flashed back to when he was tied to the operating table like a fish and the sharp and cold scalpel cut open his flesh without anesthesia\u2026 His whole body trembled violently and he pushed Qu Moyu away.Qu Moyu was immersed in emotion and was pushed off unpreparedly. He staggered to stabilise his body.Shen Dai\u2019s chest was heaving up and down. His moist eyes looked at Qu Moyu in alarm and horror. He even covered the back of his neck with his hands.Qu Moyu supported the table with his arms, trapping Shen Dai with the outline of his body. He looked down on Shen Dai, feeling extremely uncomfortable and said softly, \u201cAh Dai, don\u2019t be afraid.\u201dShen Dai took a deep breath and whispered, \u201cI want to go see Qiuqiu.\u201d\u201cQiuqiu is sleeping.\u201d\u201cHe\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAh Dai.\u201d Qu Moyu increased his tone, \u201cYou will have to face me sooner or later.\u201dShen Dai froze. He slowly raised his head and looked directly into Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes. He said slowly, \u201cWhat\u2019s your requirements?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhen we agreed to get married, you asked for my requirements. And now you use Qiuqiu\u2019s custody to coerce me. So I also want to know your requirements.\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s eyes gradually became a clear red bloodshot, \u201cYou want me to accompany you. You want me to sleep with you. You might also want me to accompany you through the susceptible period. So give me a time limit.\u201d\u201c\u2026What do you mean by \u2018time limit\u2019?\u201d\u201cThe marriage at that time also had a time limit. It should be no more than five years.\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s lips trembled slightly, \u201cMr. Qu, how long will it take for you to let me go?\u201dQu Moyu had to bend down temporarily to relieve the sudden pain in his chest. He gritted his teeth: \u201cShen Dai, did I not say it clearly enough? Or did I not act resolutely enough? What is a \u2018time limit\u2019? We already have a child together. We are a family. I said I will take care of you all my life.\u201d\u201cWe will never be a \u2018family\u2019.\u201d Shen Dai said with tears, \u201cYou will have your own family. You will have your own children. You can have many children, far better children than Qiuqiu. But I only have Qiuqiu\u2026 \u2026you still have to rob him from me.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t want to rob him from you.\u201d Qu Moyu held Shen Dai\u2019s face and said sternly, \u201cI just want you to stay by my side. I know I wasn\u2019t good enough for you before. I misunderstood you and forced you to wash off the \u2018mark\u2019. I know you have had a hard time this year.\u201d Every word he said was stumbling and difficult, because he had never admitted his fault to anyone or accepted it softly. But compared to Shen Dai\u2019s experience of suffering, the hardships he can think of and dare not think of, what are these few words? \u201cAh Dai, I feel guilty towards you. And I really like you. Only if you stay, I will compensate you. I will prove that I can make you live well.\u201dShen Dai looked at the S-class alpha that he once loved, who was always like an arrogant lion. At this time, he bowed his head and said soft words that were incompatible with who he really was. He just felt flustered and wondered if this was another one of his facade. He had suffered enough. He was afraid. He shook his head: \u201cWe are not of the same world. I approached you beyond my own power. I have made mistakes and I have paid for them.\u201d\u201cWhat is the difference between your world and my world? We clearly agree with each other. We\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just a low class omega.\u201dQu Moyu said anxiously, \u201cI just said that in the spur of the moment because I was angry!\u201d\u201cI remember every word you said. And every word has a purpose. It\u2019s not what you said in the spur of the moment because you were angry. It\u2019s your truth.\u201d Shen Dai said softly, \u201cQu Moyu, give me a time limit.\u201dQu Moyu slammed his fist on the solid wood table and said in a hoarse voice, \u201cYou will always be mine.\u201d\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.07.18\u058d\u058d\u058dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He glanced at the mobile phone on the table. When he saw that the caller ID was \u201cFather\u201d, his eyebrows immediately twitched.Shen Dai took the opportunity to push Qu Moyu away. But he was held with both wrists in one hand by Qu Moyu. Qu Moyu took the phone and hung up.Shen Dai also saw the name on the screen from the corner of his eye and he said, \u201cDoes your father know?\u201d\u201cKnow what?\u201d Qu Moyu pressed Shen Dai\u2019s wrist to his heart.Shen Dai said sarcastically, \u201cKnow that you have an illegitimate child and you brought the illegitimate child and your mistress home?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019ll find out soon.\u201d Qu Moyu was still frowning. He didn\u2019t like Shen Dai saying that he and Qiuqiu were his mistress and illegitimate child. But he did say the word \u2018illegitimate child\u2019 himself.\u201cHow are you going to explain things to him?\u201d Shen Dai said in a deep voice; \u201cYou are already engaged. The Qu family doesn\u2019t need an ordinary alpha illegitimate child.\u201d\u201cThis is not something you need to worry about.\u201d Qu Moyu lowered his head and kissed Shen Dai\u2019s forehead, \u201cYou can go and see Qiuqiu.\u201dAs soon as he backed away, Shen Dai jumped off the table and walked away quickly without looking back. Qu Moyu looked at the door that was thrown closed and he was briefly in a trance. As Shen Dai left, the fragrance gradually dissipated in the air and the room returned to its usual quietness and loneliness. He sat on the table, clinging tightly to the edge of the table with one hand until his five fingers hurt. Why is it that he had already had Shen Dai by his side again but he still felt like he couldn\u2019t have him?What he wanted was not a Shen Dai who resisted him, guarded against him, and feared him. He wanted things to be as they were in the past. He thought that as long as Shen Dai and Qiuqiu came back and they lived under one roof, they could become\u2026 a family. Aren\u2019t they a family now? His wife and his child are in his house. Everything seems to be falling in place. But why is he still so tormented?His phone rang again.Qu Moyu stared at the phone. His eyes were dark and cold. It was as if he was looking at the enemy\u2019s front line, looking for an opportunity to strike. He reached out his hand and turned on the speakerphone.\u201cWhat did you say to Xiaochu?!\u201d Qu Shen growled at the other end of the receiver.\u201cI said I wanted to break off the engagement with him. I gave him a reason to save his face and he cooperated.\u201d\u201cQu Moyu! Do you remember what we talked about yesterday? You think you like that researcher, you can just keep him by your side. What kind of omega is Xiaochu, as long as you don\u2019t be too blatant, he won\u2019t lose his appetite.\u201dQu Moyu took a deep breath: \u201cShen Dai gave birth to my child. An alpha son.\u201dThere was a long silence on the other end of the phone.Then Qu Shen gritted his teeth and called out his name: \u201cIsn\u2019t that kid knocked out at the time when the \u2018mark\u2019 was washed off?!\u201d\u201cThe \u2018mark\u2019 was washed off, but the child was born. I have done a paternity test and it is indeed mine.\u201d Qu Moyu said indifferently, \u201cDo you think Zhou Xiaochu has such an \u2018appetite\u2019?\u201dQu Shen was silent for a long time again. Across the phone, Qu Moyu could hear the gasping sound. Qu Moyu also kept silent. If they were talking face to face, the game would be more beneficial to him, because his pheromone was much stronger than his father\u2019s. Although he couldn\u2019t use pheromone to suppress his father, it was already embedded in the genetics. That subtle aura can help him balance the weakness in his bloodline. Both father and son are well aware of this. So when he comes of age, when he encounters very important matters, especially when the two of them disagree with each other, Qu Shen will try to avoid talking to him face to face.After a few breathing adjustments, Qu Shen also calmed down. He said coldly, \u201cSo, an ordinary omega gave birth to a child of yours, what do you want? Do you even think it\u2019s possible to marry him?\u201dThis time, it was Qu Moyu\u2019s turn to be silent. His will is being madly pulled by two forces. Reason and cognition tell him that it is impossible to marry an ordinary omega. For the so-called feelings of \u2018liking\u2019 someone. Finding a powerless person to be his life partner will become his biggest mistake in his life. But his will, his emotions, and his heart all gave him a crystal clear direction. He likes Shen Dai. He wants Shen Dai. And Shen Dai\u2019s own excellence is far more than most average people. They also have a child together. What more can they ask for?The alarm bell in his heart rang again and again. Sensibility and reason were tearing his judgement. He had never been in such a dilemma in his life. He used to despise those who did stupid things for love. Should he also go against the past principle and experience to make an emotionally driven major decision?\u201cTell me.\u201d Qu Shen was trembling with anger, \u201cAre you love-sick? Do you really want to marry him?\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d Qu Moyu blurted out. This sentence even preceded his thinking. It came out more out of his own unconscious desire.Qu Shen didn\u2019t know how to scold his son for a while. Originally, the father and son had a long-term consensus on this matter and there was no need to argue at all. He couldn\u2019t believe that the son of his, an S-class alpha, would also be so stupid. Taking a deep breath, he gritted his teeth and said, \u201cQu Moyu, I ask you three questions. First, what is Shen Dai\u2019s background? Second, what is his pheromone level? And third, what is the pheromone level of the child he gave birth to?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat does he have other than what you fancy when you were in the susceptible period?\u201dQu Moyu clenched his fists. His face looked extremely ugly. He couldn\u2019t refute his father for a while. Because in the past 20 years of his life, he also believed that people can\u2019t easily break the past self.\u201cTell me. He gave birth to an alpha son. And then, what is the pheromone level?\u201d Qu Shen mocked, \u201cHe is just a B-class omega. Even if the child has your genes, it would be good enough to at least have an A-class alpha. Do you want an ordinary heir? Do you dare to hand over your heritage to him?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s A-class.\u201d Qu Moyu said sternly, \u201cFather, you are also an A-class alpha. Even the combination of top AOs will not guarantee to give birth to an S-class alpha. That\u2019s a very small probability\u2026\u201d He actually didn\u2019t know Qiuqiu\u2019s pheromone level, because there was no document. So he sent someone to the hospital to check. But it turned out Shen Dai didn\u2019t test it. So he also didn\u2019t want to test it. But it was maybe because he was afraid of disappointment.\u201cAt least there is a chance.\u201d Qu Shen raised his voice, \u201cDo you really want to marry a B-class omega? When you sober up after two years, do you dare to look back and see what stupid things you have said today?! You are still an S-class alpha. What\u2019s the difference between you and those sentimental ordinary assholes?\u201dQu Moyu bit his lower lip. Two blue veins burst out on his forehead.Qu Shen cursed in a low voice and said coldly: \u201cThe child has already been born. Our Qu family will not treat him badly, as long as he is calm and doesn\u2019t have any crooked thoughts. On the Zhou family\u2019s side, you and I will go meet them another day. We will go to their door to apologise together and settle this matter. They won\u2019t be willing to break off the marriage because you have an illegitimate child. Just give them a step down.\u201dThis time, before Qu Moyu could reply, Qu Shen hung up the phone first.Qu Moyu put both hands on the table. Under the black cloth, two thick back muscles undulating like wild beasts. Pheromones roaming in his body violently. On the ebony desk weighing several hundred kilograms, all the items are shaking.After a long time, he calmed down. The slender five fingers brushed the slightly sweaty black hair and the pair of beast eyes looked deep in thought.***Qiuqiu was full of energy when he was awake and could really sleep when it was time for him to sleep. Shen Dai chatted softly with the nanny in the house and helped organise things, which did not affect the baby sleeping at all.\u201cThis little alpha is really energetic. He just grabbed my hair and didn\u2019t let go. Look at his long hands and feet. He will definitely grow taller in the future.\u201dThere was a hint of tenderness in Shen Dai\u2019s eyes. As long as he looked at Qiuqiu, he seemed to be able to resist all the pain: \u201cIf he pulls your hair, you need to find something to divert his attention. Otherwise it will hurt a lot.\u201d\u201cHaha it\u2019s okay. Let him practise his grip. It will be useful when he learns to roll over and crawl.\u201dThe door was knocked twice, then pushed open. Qu Moyu walked in slowly.The gentle expression on Shen Dai\u2019s face disappeared immediately. He lowered his head to sort out Qiuqiu\u2019s saliva towel.The nanny had already seen that there was a big problem between the young couple, otherwise it would be impossible for a good son to use an alternative alpha pheromone. She nodded respectfully to Qu Moyu and left with understanding.Shen Dai said softly, \u201cDon\u2019t come here. You\u2019ll wake Qiuqiu up.\u201dQu Moyu paused. But he still walked over and sat next to Shen Dai: \u201cIf you want Qiuqiu to accept me, you have to let me get closer to him.\u201d He glanced at the crib, \u201cLook, he\u2019s not awake.\u201dShen Dai stopped talking.Qu Moyu picked up a saliva towel that was cleanly washed and smelled a slight fragrance from it. Although he didn\u2019t know much about fabrics other than custom suits, this kind of fabric that was hard after washing was cheap at first glance: \u201cWe have bought so many new ones. Why do you keep the old ones?\u201d\u201cThis child has a fetish. Familiar things make him feel safe.\u201d\u201cPeople grow up day by day and they will be exposed to new things everyday. Everything should tend to become better, right?\u201dShen Dai didn\u2019t look at him, grabbed the saliva towel in his hand and folded it skillfully.Qu Moyu picked up another piece and folded it like him: \u201cIs it like this?\u201dShen Dai gave him a slightly surprised look.\u201cI\u2019ll take care of Qiuqiu with you.\u201d Qu Moyu put the saliva towel in Shen Dai\u2019s hand and held his hand, \u201cI haven\u2019t taken care of children but I have a strong learning ability.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have the time to do this deliberately.\u201d\u201cI will have time if it\u2019s for you.\u201d Qu Moyu glanced at the crib not far away. It was his son who was sleeping soundly. But the pheromone smell of another alpha could clearly be captured in the air. He will not allow his son to think of another alpha as his father. He will definitely get QiuQiu to accept him.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.07.19\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: I didn\u2019t check comments lately since I was busy.

Anyway, it was impossible for him to stay there for Qu Moyu to stare at.Qu Moyu followed Shen Dai around the house, asking about this and that and their functions. Many things about newborns are very strange in his eyes. Soon, he sneaked around to Qiuqiu\u2019s bedside.The child-rearing nanny felt that Qiuqiu\u2019s sleeping position could be improved, so he was wrapped tightly with only one head exposed.Qu Moyu thought it was a little funny. The little thing that was always showing its teeth and claws and crying now looks like a big sushi roll where he can\u2019t even move his hands and feet. It\u2019s very interesting. He couldn\u2019t help but stretch out his hand and lightly poke Qiuqiu\u2019s fat cheeks with his fingertips.Shen Dai came out of the bathroom and saw Qu Moyu\u2019s movements, he whispered in between his breath, \u201cDon\u2019t touch him!\u201dQiuqiu\u2019s two eyebrows twitched like caterpillars and then his eyelids began to tremble. He had just opened his mouth while whimpering and drooling, but suddenly his mouth opened wide, and he began to cry in his sleep.Qu Moyu retracted his hand in fright, took two steps back, and glanced at Shen Dai with a guilty conscience.Shen Dai hurriedly walked over, patted Qiuqiu\u2019s little chest and whispered, \u201cShh, darling. Darling, it\u2019s alright. Go to sleep.\u201d He released a soothing pheromone and said to Qu Moyu, \u201cYou stand still. Far away.\u201dQu Moyu touched his nose and retreated to the wall dejectedly.Shen Dai bowed his waist and patted Qiuqiu lightly with one hand. He pulled the bangs that were hanging in front of him behind his ears with his other hand, revealing a clear jaw and a long, fair neck. When he looked at Qiuqiu, the corners of his eyes curved. With a smile on his face, his pale pink lips opened and closed in a soft tone, which looked indescribably gentle.Qu Moyu\u2019s heart thumped a few times. His omega was coaxing their child to sleep. Such a picture deserves all the warm and beautiful descriptions in the world.As Qiuqiu\u2019s cry faded, Shen Dai breathed a sigh of relief. He sat down beside the bed, constantly releasing pheromones to comfort his child while watching the little baby fall asleep peacefully.Qu Moyu was so far away that he couldn\u2019t see Qiuqiu even with his neck stretched. Shen Dai still turned his back to himself. As an alpha father, he was more and more eager to participate. So he couldn\u2019t help asking in a low voice, \u201cIs he asleep?\u201dShen Dai turned his face and gave Qu Moyu a cold look, the meaning was self-evident.\u201cUh, let him sleep. I\u2019ll go out first.\u201d Qu Moyu went out in despair. He decided to try to take a closer look at Qiuqiu tomorrow when he was awake. After buying so many toys, there might be something that Qiuqiu will like.When he went downstairs, he saw the childcare nanny was chatting with Uncle Heng. Qu Moyu glanced at her and motioned her to come over.The two walked aside and Qu Moyu said, \u201cI have read your resume. You have been a paediatric nurse for more than ten years.\u201dThe nanny smiled and said, \u201cYes, Mr. Qu.\u201d This is where she has an advantage over ordinary childcare nanny that she can enter such a wealthy family.\u201cOkay.\u201d Qu Moyu nodded, \u201cYou can help me pump some Qiuqiu\u2019s gland fluid, so that it won\u2019t be discovered by Shen Dai.\u201dThe nanny was stunned.\u201cIs it possible to do it at home?\u201d Just like drawing blood, plunging a needle into the gland to extract it, at least that\u2019s what Qu Moyu knows. He was not sure if it can be done on a baby.The nanny said hesitantly: \u201cYes.\u201d She asked, \u201cMr. Qu, can you tell me what it is for? I need to know the amount of extraction and how to store it.\u201d\u201cTo measure the pheromone level.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes sank as his thoughts were surging. He was going to take Qiuqiu\u2019s gland fluid to the hospital he invested in for testing. If it was A-class, it would be better. Otherwise, the Qu family wouldn\u2019t even give Shen Dai a straight eye.***Qu Moyu went to the company for a meeting in the afternoon. When he got home, it was past dinner time. He took off his suit jacket and handed it to Aunt Lan and asked, \u201cHow did Ah Dai eat today? The nutritionist gave him the meal. Does he like it?\u201dAunt Lan said: \u201cAh Dai said he likes it. But you know he is not a picky eater. Even if he doesn\u2019t like it, he wouldn\u2019t say it. I observed that he probably thought the old duck broth was a little greasy but he still drank it. He ate a small bowl of meat and vegetables, as well as a bowl of rice. The overall appetite was not too much but not too little.\u201d\u201cWhat did the nutritionist say?\u201d\u201cHe said that Ah Dai didn\u2019t take care of himself well after giving birth and he was very tired. Now, he is relatively weak, but he has a good foundation. As long as he eats well, sleeps well, feels good, and cooperates with some exercise, he will gradually get better.\u201dThinking of Shen Dai\u2019s thin appearance, Qu Moyu felt uncomfortable: \u201cMake him fatter as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cMaster, I think you can consult a doctor about something.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dAunt Lan whispered: \u201cI asked a little today. Ah Dai has never been in estrus since he gave birth to Qiuqiu. Omega usually will be in estrus within two or three months after giving birth. This estrus is helpful to indicate that all the functions of the body have recovered. If he does not get an estrus for more than three months, it proves that the body is not very good and needs to see a doctor.\u201d She finally said, her expression darkened, \u201cThis is what I knew when I was taking care of your mother. She was at that time\u2026 not very good\u2026\u2026\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s face changed. His mother was depressed after giving birth and suffered great physical damage. Later, she never conceived a child again. As for whether she was unwilling or unable to become pregnant again, he did not know. He only knew that his father and mother were a couple who were married, \u2018marked\u2019 and bundled grudges, love and hate for each other. they torture each other in a long life. If it was not for the mother who gave birth to an S-class alpha like him, his father would never accept that he has only one child in his life.\u201cAunt Lan, I understand.\u201d Qu Moyu said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell him these things.\u201d\u201cOf course, young master.\u201d\u201cIs he still in Qiuqiu\u2019s room?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dQu Moyu went upstairs. Aunt Lan\u2019s hesitant, small voice came from behind: \u201cMaster, please be good to Ah Dai.\u201dQu Moyu walked to the door of the room, knocked twice and then opened the door.The nanny was playing with her cell phone while Shen Dai was reading. They were both sitting on the sofa beside the crib.The nanny stood up, pointed to the crib and whispered, \u201cThe young master is asleep.\u201dShen Dai also put down the book, as if to prevent Qu Moyu from coming to wake Qiuqiu up again.Qu Moyu stretched out his hand towards Shen Dai: \u201cQiuqiu is sleeping. You should go back to our room to rest.\u201dShen Dai stared blankly at Qu Moyu\u2019s hand, but did not move.\u201cAh Dai, let\u2019s go.\u201dOf course Shen Dai knew that he couldn\u2019t sleep here, because the nanny would be sleeping here. And also because Qu Moyu wouldn\u2019t let him. But he didn\u2019t want to be with Qu Moyu\u2026The nanny lowered her head. She didn\u2019t look at them when she shouldn\u2019t and didn\u2019t ask when she shouldn\u2019t. But the atmosphere was really embarrassing.\u201cAh Dai.\u201d Qu Moyu called his name again and said softly, \u201cBe good.\u201dShen Dai stood up abruptly, walked quickly to the door, crossed Qu Moyu, and went out directly.Qu Moyu chased after a few steps: \u201cDon\u2019t be angry.\u201dShen Dai lowered his head and did not speak.Qu Moyu took Shen Dai\u2019s hand and walked upstairs.As soon as he entered Qu Moyu\u2019s bedroom, Shen Dai\u2019s hair stood up. Everything here has been restored as before and the traces of destruction when Qu Moyu and himself spent the susceptible period here are long gone. But those memories are still fresh in his mind. Those sounds of violence, chaos, sweetness, and pain. Fragments of the paintings all rushed into his mind the moment he stepped into this room full of the smell of ebony wood pheromones, reminding him of a lot of things he didn\u2019t want to recall.It seems that all kinds of emotions between him and Qu Moyu have erupted in this bedroom. He has cried, laughed, screamed, begged, explained, and was accused. The entanglements between them are the biggest sins in his life. So this room carries the heaviest sin. It is the place he thought he would never set foot on again in his life. But now he seems to be trapped in it.Qu Moyu noticed Shen Dai\u2019s stiffness and naturally he also vividly remembered those good and bad memories. He said softly, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to sleep in this room, we\u2019ll change it. But you still have to sleep together with me.\u201dShen Dai withdrew his hand, unwilling to reveal his fear. He said coldly, \u201cWhatever.\u201dQu Moyu took Shen Dai into his arms and dropped a few gentle kisses on his forehead: \u201cListen to me, Ah Dai. I really want to have sex with you. I want to have sex with you every day. But I don\u2019t want to force you. I promise to give you the best experience, just like before. Can you accept it? Hmm? Okay?\u201dShen Dai remained silent.Qu Moyu raised his chin and kissed his lips: \u201cAh Dai, I really miss you. Do you miss me?\u201dShen Dai\u2019s heart was trembling. He had been so deeply immersed in Qu Moyu\u2019s tenderness that he actually had not seen his pretence. He couldn\u2019t extricate himself. It is not until he sees the person\u2019s true face that he knows which side of Qu Moyu a person can touch depends entirely on whether it is useless, useful or harmful to Qu Moyu. His \u2018relationship\u2019 with Qu Moyu, which happened to be such a gradual process. So he saw that Qu Moyu was polite and distant to him at first and then he was pampered and rewarded like a pet and he finally turned his face ruthlessly. He came face to face with his cruelty.Now he is \u2018useful\u2019 to Qu Moyu again. Even if he just wants to sleep with him. He will no longer be confused by Qu Moyu\u2019s \u2018tenderness\u2019, because he has seen the bloody coldness behind it. It can all come from the same person.\u201cI really miss you and I really like you.\u201d Qu Moyu stroked Shen Dai\u2019s soft hair, \u201cNow that you\u2019re back, let us start over.\u201dShen Dai was held in Qu Moyu\u2019s arms, but his body was still cold. He suddenly realized that after experiencing so many painful tortures from those he once loved deeply, his greatest emotion towards Qu Moyu was not hatred. But it was fear.It was the fear that he was powerless and irresistible when facing Qu Moyu. The fear that he was severely suppressed from all sides. The fear that he knew that he would be bruised over and over but he had nowhere to escape.He was afraid of Qu Moyu. And he was especially afraid that Qu Moyu would in fact treat him well.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.07.20\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: You know it\u2019s that feeling when you hope that someone you love will love you back and you were full of delusions about that person and then you realise that that person will never love you and then you\u2019re heartbroken beyond repair. But now that that person is back and trying to win you over, you are afraid of giving in to the same delusions which had broken you before. It was that fear. At least in my opinion, that was what SD was afraid of. And I know how that feels. -KPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was staring aimlessly at the carpet, as if waiting to be tortured.Qu Moyu suddenly felt sour in his heart. He walked over and sat gently beside Shen Dai. He could clearly feel Shen Dai\u2019s body stiffened.\u201cAh Dai.\u201dShen Dai lowered his head. Every cell in his body was clamouring to escape. This is because after taking a shower, Qu Moyu tore off the sticker on the back of his neck. The body washed by hot water accelerated the blood flow. The smell of ebony was pouring into his nerves and his hair was stained with Qu Moyu\u2019s pheromone. Even though the two of them only had a piece of clothes on them now, he felt like he was already surrounded by Qu Moyu.Qu Moyu said that he would not \u2018force\u2019 him. But this sentence itself is a paradox. As long as Qu Moyu releases an inducement pheromone to him, he will become \u2018willing\u2019. An omega can never truly resist an S-class alpha.\u201cAh Dai, it\u2019s time to rest.\u201d Qu Moyu reached out and stroked Shen Dai\u2019s hair.However, as if struck by lightning, Shen Dai stood up abruptly. He took a few steps back. His pupils moving around frantically in his eyes. He was unable to hide his panic.Qu Moyu\u2019s heart was aching. Shen Dai\u2019s demeanour that avoided him like a plague made his self-esteem even more impacted. From childhood to adulthood, he could not count how many people showed affection to him one after another. How could Shen Dai be like this towards him? He gritted his teeth: \u201cAre you afraid of me?\u201dShen Dai\u2019s lips trembled slightly as he stood there bewildered.\u201cI said I won\u2019t force you. Why are you afraid of me?\u201d Qu Moyu was angry and sad. This was obviously an omega who looked so vulnerable. How could it be as difficult to break through him like a city wall?Shen Dai opened his mouth, but didn\u2019t know what to say.Qu Moyu took a deep breath. He calmed down and stretched out his hand to Shen Dai: \u201cCome here.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s eyes fell on Qu Moyu\u2019s hand and he didn\u2019t move for a long time.\u201cCome here.\u201d Qu Moyu aggravated his tone. It was obviously mixed with anger.Shen Dai walked over slowly. He felt like an animal being domesticated. If he didn\u2019t put his paws on his master\u2019s hand obediently as he was ordered, he would be whipped in the next second.He trembled and put his hand on Qu Moyu\u2019s palm.Qu Moyu grabbed his hand and dragged him onto the bed.Shen Dai let out a low cry. He struggled instinctively a few times. But quickly realised his situation and then calmed down. Qu Moyu\u2019s heavy body was pressed against him. The air in his lungs was squeezed invisibly. He couldn\u2019t move and he didn\u2019t even dare to breathe loudly.Qu Moyu gently kissed Shen Dai\u2019s forehead and asked in a low voice, \u201cWhy are you afraid of me?\u201dThis question is really ridiculous. Shen Dai doesn\u2019t know how to answer it. He also doesn\u2019t want to answer it. There are too many reasons for him to list them all down. If he had to speak, he just wanted to ask a question \u2013 \u201cDo you not know?\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s kiss fell on Shen Dai\u2019s eyelids, nose, and lips again. He repeated reluctantly, \u201cWhy are you afraid of me?\u201d It seemed that he couldn\u2019t accept Shen Dai\u2019s answer even if he were to be given an answer.Shen Dai looked away.Qu Moyu pinched his cheek and pulled his face over. The pulp of his thumb slid lightly over the tender lips as he said solemnly: \u201cWho do you think I am? What will I do to you? I was dazed by Bai Xiangwan\u2019s pheromone that day. When do I ever need to force others in this life?\u201d He always refused one after another those who had plans to pursue him. Shen Dai was the only one. The only omega he desires so much. Yet this omega avoids him?Shen Dai whispered, \u201cCan I go to the guest room\u2026\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Qu Moyu said perfunctorily.Shen Dai lightly bit his lower lip. There were thousands of thoughts hidden under his drooping eyes, but he didn\u2019t want to reveal the slightest bit of them to Qu Moyu.\u201cI said I would be good to you. And I said I would take care of you and Qiuqiu. They\u2019re all true. Why won\u2019t you believe me? Why are you so defensive of me?\u201d Qu Moyu couldn\u2019t describe the pain in his heart that he had nowhere to vent. Shen Dai was clearly in his arms and he was already firmly caught in his hands. But he had no sense of control. The two were so close. But he felt that Shen Dai was far away from him. And he will firmly go further and further.\u201cYou have already got what you wanted.\u201d Shen Dai said sadly. He doesn\u2019t know what Qu Moyu is dissatisfied with. But everything this S-class alpha wanted, he had already got what he wanted. Even the child he gave birth to after going to a half-death situation and going through countless hardships and pains, Qu Moyu only needs to easily send a lawyer to snatch him away. With a few threats. And he is still not satisfied.\u201cI want you.\u201d Qu Moyu suddenly felt his nose sore. Shen Dai\u2019s indifference and resistance made his heart feel like it was being pierced by a knife, \u201cI want us to go back to how we used to be.\u201dShen Dai was silent for a moment. He then murmured a repetition of what he had said: \u201cYou have already got what you wanted.\u201d The world is so unfair. But you would always get what you wanted.Qu Moyu thumped the soft bed with a fist. The ruthlessness and ferociousness in his eyes flashed. The deep thoughts and long-suppressed desires surged into his mind. He wanted to just take him there and then but when he looked at Shen Dai closing his eyes and shrinking in fear, his heart softened. He hugged Shen Dai tightly into his arms. He then buried his face in Shen Dai\u2019s warm neck and breathed in the fragrant air: \u201cAh Dai, don\u2019t be afraid of me.\u201d He paused and then said, \u201cI swear. I will never use pheromone suppression on you again.\u201dShen Dai opened his eyes and stared blankly at the chandelier on the ceiling. His eyes gradually got wet.The two hugged and laid on the same bed. But their hearts seemed to be separated by mountains and seas.***Shen Dai didn\u2019t know when he fell asleep. He didn\u2019t dare to move around in Qu Moyu\u2019s arms. His posture was stiff and he couldn\u2019t sleep at all. He was probably too tired and lost consciousness last night.Almost as soon as Shen Dai woke up, Qu Moyu woke up. He was like a stalking wolf, holding onto his prey to prevent him from running away without him noticing. Seeing Shen Dai still trapped in his arms, he completely ignored the pain and numbness in his arms. He held the person tightly in his arms, enjoying the warmth and stability he forcibly left behind. He closed his eyes and planned to continue sleeping for a while.Shen Dai still kept his original posture and couldn\u2019t move. But he couldn\u2019t lie down anymore. After a long time, he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to get up.\u201d\u201cSleep a little longer. I can sleep with you until noon.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s voice was lazy and pleasant. He was speaking close to Shen Dai\u2019s ears, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to wake up at night to take care of Qiuqiu. You will have to sleep well in the future.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to go see him.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s fine. You need more rest.\u201d Qu Moyu kissed Shen Dai\u2019s ear.Shen Dai thought for a while and then went to get the mobile phone at the bedside table. He could see the monitoring of the crib facing Qiuqiu on his mobile phone.Qu Moyu grabbed his arm back: \u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s heart trembled. He quietly adjusted his posture and shrank his body. But Qu Moyu\u2019s hand was on his waist and their bodies were in contact with each other in an ambiguous area.Just then, there was a knock on the bedroom door.Qu Moyu frowned. His usual daily life is relatively regular and he doesn\u2019t need anyone to wake him up. If he decides to get up later, he must be tired and needs more rest. No one will disturb him unless it is necessary. This was the first night that Shen Dai had returned to him and the two of them had spent the first night together. Who was so ignorant?\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Qu Moyu asked, feeling displeased.Uncle Heng\u2019s voice can be heard from outside the door: \u201cYoung Master. The Master and Madam are here. Please get up quickly.\u201d\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.07.21\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: Qu Shen (Qu Moyu\u2019s father) is the character I hated the most.

He frowned and his face looked a bit dignified.Qu Moyu brought him and Qiuqiu home. Sooner or later, Qu Shen would find out. Although this was not his own will, in Qu Shen\u2019s eyes, it is conceivable that he would be judged as such a person. He didn\u2019t want to be humiliated.Apparently Qu Moyu also understood this: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to go downstairs. You can go to accompany Qiuqiu.\u201dShen Dai was more than just willing to accompany Qiuqiu at this time. He could not wait to even escape with Qiuqiu. Qu Shen came to the door on purpose. He must have known the existence of the child. Shen Dai had always wanted to keep his child away from the Qu family. Qu Moyu regards Qiuqiu\u2019s custody as a piece of cake in his hands and it depends on his \u2018performance\u2019 before deciding whether to use it or not. So what about Qu Shen? What does Qu Shen want to do?Qu Moyu saw Shen Dai\u2019s worries. He held Shen Dai\u2019s shoulders and pulled him closer. He hugged and kissed his omega: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m here.\u201dShen Dai glanced at Qu Moyu silently. He got out of bed and left.When he came to the guest room, the nanny was feeding Qiuqiu. Qiuqiu\u2019s two little hands were holding the bottle and he was eating very attentively. But as soon as Shen Dai entered the room, his two big eyes turned to his father and at the same time, his mouth whimpered. He spit out and pushed the bottle away with both hands. Even his little feet kicked in the air.Shen Dai\u2019s nerves were tense all night, but he relaxed the moment he saw Qiuqiu. He smiled helplessly: \u201cLet me feed him.\u201dThe nanny also smiled: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to speak, but he\u2019s already so smart.\u201dShen Dai took Qiuqiu and the bottle from the nanny, leaned on the sofa and put the pacifier back into Qiuqiu\u2019s mouth.Shen Dai asked the nanny about Qiuqiu\u2019s situation last night. This was the first night he did not participate in the whole process after he gave birth to Qiuqiu. He just can\u2019t stand it. He knew that he had to let Qiuqiu reduce his dependence on him step by step. Otherwise, he would not be able to do anything. But when it came time for him to quit it all together, he was reluctant. If it wasn\u2019t for Qu Moyu holding him all the time last night, he would have come down long ago.\u201cOh, he cried for a long time.\u201d The nanny smiled bitterly. \u201cLook. His eyes are still a little swollen. It\u2019s the first time he spends the night without you. It\u2019s normal. Every child has to get used to it slowly. It will be fine after a few days.\u201dShen Dai gently touched Qiuqiu\u2019s soft, pink eyelids. He can\u2019t help but to imagine how sad Qiuqiu should be crying when he woke up in the middle of the night and didn\u2019t see him there. \u201cDid you take some of my stuff for him to smell?\u201d\u201cYes. And it works.\u201d\u201cYou can also spray some perfume in that transparent bottle. That is his favourite alpha\u2019s pheromone.\u201dThe babysitter\u2019s face looked embarrassed.Shen Dai understood her concerns: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. If Mr. Qu smells it, just tell him that I sprayed it. The most important thing is to appease Qiuqiu. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201dThe nanny smiled apologetically: \u201cOkay.\u201d She looked at the time: \u201cMr. Shen, I\u2019ll change shifts with the eldest sister of the day shift in a while. Just tell her if you have anything to tell, or just call me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You stayed up all night too. You can go to sleep.\u201dWhen the nanny packed her things and was about to leave, someone came in. But it was not the nanny who changed shifts. It was Madam Qu.Shen Dai looked at Madam Qu and smiled reluctantly.The nanny closed the door wisely and left. Madam Qu\u2019s gaze fell from Shen Dai\u2019s face to Qiuqiu, and then she was reluctant to move her gaze away. She came over and signalled to Shen Dai that she wanted to take over.Shen Dai said softly: \u201cWait a moment. He is eating happily now and he doesn\u2019t want to do anything else. I\u2019m afraid of choking him.\u201dMadam Qu sat down and looked at Qiuqiu with infinite love and tenderness: \u201cWhy does he seem to have grown up a little after we haven\u2019t seen him for a few days?\u201d\u201cI weighed him myself yesterday and he was indeed two hundred grams heavier.\u201d Shen Dai glanced at the door. He wasn\u2019t sure if Madam Qu was the only one here.Madam Qu saw through his thoughts: \u201cI came here by myself. The father and son are quarrelling. It gave me a headache.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHis father wants to see Qiuqiu. I think it\u2019s better for me to bring him.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s face changed slightly: \u201cQiuqiu will definitely cry. He doesn\u2019t like to be near unfamiliar alphas. He rejects even more\u2026\u201d In front of Madam Qu, he still endured the words to say that Qiuqiu rejected Qu Moyu.\u201cI know. But he has to see Qiuqiu. I think it\u2019s better for him to see Qiuqiu alone than the two of you together. If Qiuqiu feels your nervousness and discomfort, he will cry with discomfort.\u201dShen Dai hesitated. It was impossible for him to refuse. But Madam Qu was right. Qiuqiu could indeed accurately detect his emotions. If he was afraid, Qiuqiu would also be afraid.Madam Qu touched Qiuqiu\u2019s furry little head: \u201cWhat a good boy.\u201dShen Dai looked at Qiuqiu anxiously, seeing that he was carefree and only caring about eating. The bottle would soon be empty.After Qiuqiu finished eating, Madam Qu took him into her arms. And when she saw his giggling appearance, her heart was about to melt. She tapped Qiuqiu\u2019s little chest: \u201cQiuqiu, let\u2019s go out with grandma to play. Will you be okay for a while?\u201dShen Dai wiped the corner of Qiuqiu\u2019s milk-stained mouth and said sternly, \u201cMadam, what does Master Qu want?\u201d Whether it was out of instinct or other considerations, he didn\u2019t want to take Qiuqiu to show Qu Shen. Qu Shen wouldn\u2019t look at his ordinary alpha grandson born to an ordinary omega, so why should he scare Qiuqiu off?Madam Qu said indifferently: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to bother with the Qu family\u2019s affairs. But I don\u2019t want him to scare you. Don\u2019t worry, I will send him back soon.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ok.\u201d Shen Dai was ten thousand times reluctant but could only watch Madam Qu take Qiuqiu away.In the study, the father and son of the Qu family were looking at each other across a desk. There\u2019s tension in their eyes and there was no sign of any of them backing down for a while.\u201cYou actually brought your mistress and illegitimate child to live at home. What do you mean by this? You even let them enter the house?\u201d\u201cThe child is still young and it is convenient to take care of him at home.\u201d\u201cBullshit. You can take care of him wherever. Did you do it on purpose for the Zhou family to see?\u201dQu Moyu said calmly: \u201cNo. I just want to take care of them close to me. The break off is my fault. I can\u2019t deliberately embarrass Zhou Xiaochu. I will handle it myself.\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to handle it with? You don\u2019t have to break off the marriage.\u201d Qu Shen said sternly, \u201cWhen the words spread out that we have used and discarded the Zhou family, what about our future cooperation? You want to break off the marriage as soon as your mind is feverish. You know how much profit was involved here. Your brain is muddled, isn\u2019t it?!\u201dQu Moyu lowered his head and stressed his words, \u201cI will handle it myself.\u201dQu Shen was so angry that his face turned blue: \u201cQu Moyu, I think you\u2019re really lovesick! Zhou Xiaochu is such a perfect wife candidate. The matter of Shen Dai and this child, you should give them some money and say something nice. He will definitely accept it. If you like Shen Dai, just keep him by your side. No one gives a shit about that. But you must know what is really important!\u201d\u201cShen Dai doesn\u2019t accept it.\u201d Qu Moyu slowly raised his head and looked directly at his father. He also thought that way at the beginning. As long as he kept Shen Dai by his side, he had countless ways to make Shen Dai \u2018voluntarily\u2019 stay by his side. He did it. But he found that what he wanted was much more than that. What he wanted is the Shen Dai who will have a place for him in his eyes and in his heart.Qu Shen was stunned for a while. He then came back to his senses and said with contempt. \u201c\u2018He doesn\u2019t accept it\u2019? Why? He still wants to marry into the Qu family? Yes. He is indeed a high-end talent who can enter our research institute. He has extraordinary skills. While you are lovesick, he gave birth to a child for you by any means at the same time. You are an S-class alpha yet you are tricked into this? Are you still not sober yet?!\u201dQu Shen is worthy of being Qu Moyu\u2019s father. He knows very well how to deal with his son\u2019s painful points. These words slapped hard at the face of this S-class alpha.Qu Shen gave another powerful blow: \u201cYou can\u2019t even handle your own omega. It\u2019s really embarrassing for the Qu family to be led by the nose by him.\u201dQu Moyu took a deep breath, pressed his jaw down and stared at his father with sharp eyes. His pupils were dark and unpredictable, implying anger: \u201cI want to keep Shen Dai. I like him. We have a child and it makes sense for me to marry him.\u201dThat look made Qu Shen shudder. Although he is Qu Moyu\u2019s father, the oppressive feeling of facing an S-class alpha will not completely disappear because of blood relation. He paused and restrained the messy pheromones: \u201cA wife with no family background and low pheromone level of only B-class and an A-class alpha son. Are you satisfied with this life?\u201d\u201cWe will have more children.\u201d Qu Moyu said coldly, \u201cBesides, I won\u2019t \u2018mark\u2019 him. If he can\u2019t give birth to an S-class heir, I will find someone else to give birth to one.\u201dQu Shen narrowed his eyes.\u201cFather, this is my compromise.\u201d Qu Moyu stared at Qu Shen. His eyes seemed to say it\u2019s your turn to compromise.Qu Shen\u2019s face was tense and his lungs were about to explode with anger.Just as the father and son were playing a game with their eyes, Madam Qu came in with Qiuqiu in her arms.Qu Moyu stood up immediately, carefully restrained his pheromone and watched Qiuqiu\u2019s reaction nervously.Qu Shen also stared at Qiuqiu.Qiuqiu\u2019s round eyes twitched between the two of them and he immediately pouted in disgust. He made a \u2018yah\u2019 sound in protest and twisted up in Madam Qu\u2019s arms. He looked like he was about to cry.\u201cBe good. Qiuqiu is a good boy.\u201d Madam Qu patted Qiuqiu.Qu Moyu took a few steps back silently and Qu Shen glared at his son and said, \u201cBring the child over here.\u201d\u201cKeep your voice down. Don\u2019t scare him.\u201d Madam Qu walked over with Qiuqiu in her arms.Qu Shen looked at Qiuqiu who was howling. His brows knitted together. His expression was very complicated and he coughed lightly: \u201cHow old is he?\u201d\u201cFour months old.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s quite sturdy.\u201d Qu Shen said coldly, \u201cAfter all, he is an A-class alpha. Shen Dai has done a lot for our Qu family. This child can be named Qu. And Shen Dai will also be rewarded. But he will never enter the Qu\u2019s family door.\u201d\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.07.22\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: Go to hell.

He imagined how Qiuqiu would react to the Qu family\u2019s father and son and how Qu Shen would think of Qiuqiu. He wondered what was going on in a place he could not see. Everything made him feel uncomfortable.Suddenly, the phone rang. Shen Dai picked it up and saw that it was a video call from Xiao Die. He originally wanted to hang up, but he had done this action too many times. His finger reacted before his brain and it swiped right.Not only Xiao Die, but Bai Xiangwan also appeared on the phone screen.\u201cMr. Shen, good morning. Is Qiuqiu awake?\u201d Xiao Die greeted with a smile, \u201cWe are in the laboratory and Teacher Bai said he misses Qiuqiu.\u201dBai Xiangwan smiled and said, \u201cAh Dai, is Qiuqiu awake?\u201dShen Dai smiled dryly: \u201cHe drank some milk just now. But now he has fallen asleep again.\u201d\u201cLet me take a look.\u201d Xiao Die brought her face closer to the screen. \u201cHey, Mr. Shen, are you back at the hotel again? This isn\u2019t your friend\u2019s house, right?\u201dShen Dai didn\u2019t want to lie and didn\u2019t know how to explain the absurd things that had happened in the past two days. So he could only say lightly: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t live with her anymore. Qiuqiu will affect her sleep time. I\u2019m not in the same room with Qiuqiu now. Let\u2019s video call later.\u201d\u201cOh, okay.\u201d Xiaodie asked again, \u201cMr. Shen, when are you coming back? Mr. Bai has arranged for you an independent office with good sunlight. I cleaned it out for you today. Do you want me to put in a fish tank? A former colleague gave me his fish tank.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201dBai Xiangwan had already seen Shen Dai\u2019s strangeness and he said, \u201cXiao Die, you go to work first. Ah Dai and I have something to talk about.\u201d\u201cOkay, let\u2019s make a video call later when Qiuqiu wakes up.\u201dThe video was hung up and Bai Xiangwan\u2019s phone call came in.Shen Dai sighed: \u201cBrother Bai.\u201d\u201cAh Dai, have you finished the process of resigning? And have your family affairs been dealt with?\u201dShen Dai spoke with difficulty: \u201cBrother Bai, I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t go now.\u201dBai Xiangwan paused for a while and said in a relaxed tone: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I\u2019m short of manpower here. And the salary for you is not low.\u201dShen Dai pressed his forehead and said in a muffled voice, \u201cI\u2019m in\u2026 Qu\u2019s house now.\u201dThere was silence on the other end of the phone for a moment. Bai Xiangwan\u2019s voice sounded restrained and he said without hesitation, \u201cYou mean\u2026 you and Qu Moyu are reconciled.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Shen Dai didn\u2019t want to tell anyone about his shitty things at all. But he could say nothing but the truth, \u201cWe have some\u2026 disputes over Qiuqiu\u2019s custody.\u201dBai Xiangwan\u2019s breathing became significantly heavier and he said solemnly, \u201cIsn\u2019t this bullying people?\u201d He knew best how much hardship Shen Dai had to endure to give birth to Qiuqiu. Now Qu Moyu wants to grab a ready-made child?Shen Dai\u2019s eyes warmed inexplicably. He adjusted his breathing again and said as calmly as possible: \u201cSenior Brother Bai, I\u2019m sorry. I let you down again. If I can handle my own affairs\u2026\u201d He suddenly didn\u2019t have the confidence to think about \u2018If\u2019. When he was faced with Qu Moyu, what odds did he have? He trembled, \u201cI may really not be able to go back to Lancheng. Please tell Xiao Die for me. I don\u2019t know how to tell her.\u201d\u201cAh Dai, if it\u2019s about money, I can help you.\u201d\u201cBrother Bai, thank you for the offer. But, no need.\u201d Shen Dai was extremely embarrassed. He wanted to say that it wasn\u2019t the money issue. But in the final analysis, it seemed that it was indeed a money issue. If he had a lot of money, he would dare to deal with Qu Moyu in a custody lawsuit. It is a pity that bullying is the basic rule in this world. The strong make the rules and the weak obey the rules.Across a wall, Shen Dai heard Qiuqiu\u2019s cry. He hurried to open the door. Madam Qu was returning with the crying Qiuqiu, followed by the gloomy-faced Qu Moyu.Shen Dai hurriedly took over Qiuqiu. He started to rock and coax him.\u201cMom, you may go back.\u201d Qu Moyu said bluntly.Madam Qu looked at Qiuqiu reluctantly: \u201cI\u2019ll see him again in two days.\u201dAfter Madam Qu left, Shen Dai held Qiuqiu farther away from Qu Moyu. But the room was only so big that he could only stand by the window as far away as possible.Qu Moyu held a small rattle in his hand, swaying gently and sneaking closer. Qiuqiu\u2019s attention was attracted by the crisp sound of the bell. He stared blankly at the colourful little toy and forgot to cry for a while.Shen Dai shook his head at Qu Moyu, motioning him not to come closer. But Qu Moyu refused to give up and was about to approach the two of them. With the bullying of the alpha pheromone, Qiuqiu came back to his senses and looked at Qu Moyu\u2019s face. He began to cry again.Qu Moyu put down the rattle in disappointment, feeling very annoyed. He had just been disciplined by his father and now he is disliked by his son again. He took a few steps back, sat on the sofa and quietly watched Shen Dai coax the child. His emotions quickly calmed down and a warm feeling gradually emerged in his chest. He was very sure that the picture in front of him was what he wanted to see for the rest of his life. For this reason, he is willing to solve all the obstacles. The more he looks at Shen Dai like this, the more he wants to monopolise him. He wants to do everything he can to make the other person smile. He admits that he underestimated the power of feelings. And he also underestimated the power of Shen Dai.It took Shen Dai more than ten minutes to put Qiuqiu to sleep. He gently put Qiuqiu into the crib and set up a good posture. Then, he straightened up and rubbed his sore arms.Qu Moyu stood up and was about to say something when Shen Dai gave a \u2018shh\u2019 sound and motioned for him to go out.The two walked to the living room next door. Qu Moyu pulled Shen Dai to sit on his lap, rubbed his shoulders and asked at the same time, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask me what my dad was here for?\u201dShen Dai neither wanted to ask nor wanted to know.\u201cThey came to see Qiuqiu.\u201d Qu Moyu answered by himself, \u201cActually, my dad still wants to see you. But he won\u2019t have any good words to say when he sees you. So I stopped him.\u201dShen Dai thought ironically; Should I thank you?\u201cBut you have to face him sooner or later. So don\u2019t be afraid. I\u2019m here.\u201d Qu Moyu took one of Shen Dai\u2019s arms and put it on his shoulder. His deep eyes were wandering over Shen Dai\u2019s lips.Shen Dai felt uncomfortable by Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes. His scalp seemed to have electricity running through it.Qu Moyu held the back of Shen Dai\u2019s head with one hand and took hold of his lips. He then slowly licked and kissed him. Shen Dai straightened his waist and instinctively wanted to step back, but he couldn\u2019t.Qu Moyu hugged Shen Dai\u2019s waist. Through the fabric, he caressed the thin waistline vaguely and sighed softly, \u201cYou are finally back.\u201d No one knew what this sentence meant to him. Be it stupid or emotional, only he himself knows how tormented it was for him to suppress and miss someone day and night. And how terrible it was to not get the pheromone he desired during the susceptible period. He can use reason to contain it. But after thinking it over two to three times, he knew that his feelings would only rebound strongly in the end. He had had enough. When he saw Shen Dai and held Shen Dai in his arms, he knew that he only wanted this person and no one could stop him.Affected by the alpha pheromone, Shen Dai\u2019s body began to heat up. After he went through a series of \u2018hardships\u2019 such as washing off the \u2018mark\u2019, a period of pregnancy, and also giving birth, he had no sexual desire for a long time. It could be that his glands were damaged. Or maybe it was because he was just too weak and too tired. His body and mind couldn\u2019t take time to think about this matter. But every time Qu Moyu gets close, he shudders. And the invasion of pheromones wakes him up from a long slumber. However, he was not excited. He was afraid. He put his hands on Qu Moyu\u2019s shoulders weakly, gritted his teeth and said, \u201cYou said you will not force me.\u201dQu Moyu kissed his side cheek and auricle. He then said against his ear, \u201cI just released a little pheromone. I didn\u2019t force you. You also want it, why don\u2019t you dare to admit it?\u201dShen Dai said softly, \u201cI- I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cAh Dai, when will you think about it?\u201d Qu Moyu picked up Shen Dai\u2019s clothes, got his big hands inside and stroked the bare skin. He suddenly slapped his ass with a bewitching voice. \u201cYou think about it now.\u201dShen Dai took a deep breath and grabbed Qu Moyu\u2019s wrist: \u201cLet go of me.\u201dQu Moyu stared straight into Shen Dai\u2019s eyes, as if he wanted to penetrate every emotion deeply. He stressed his words one by one; \u201cI\u2019m breaking off my engagement.\u201dShen Dai was stunned.\u201cThat\u2019s why my father came to see me early in the morning.\u201d Qu Moyu pulled out his hand and touched Shen Dai\u2019s face instead, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t agree. And the Zhou family may not agree. There are a lot of troubles to solve. But I will do what I say. I will break off the engagement with Zhou Xiaochu.\u201d He suddenly took a deep breath nervously, \u201cAnd then marry you.\u201dShen Dai looked at Qu Moyu stiffly.\u201cAh Dai, I originally thought that there was no need for marriage between us. A secular marriage is different from mine. The object of my marriage is a partner and it has something to do with partnerships. But you are the person I like. Since you can\u2019t accept it if you don\u2019t have a status, then I\u2019ll give you what you want. This time it\u2019s not a contract marriage. I really want to marry you. And I want you and Qiuqiu to stay by my side all the time.\u201dShen Dai slowly pushed Qu Moyu away and stood up.Qu Moyu looked at the person in front of him without knowing why. He expected that Shen Dai would be very surprised and perhaps even more moved. But the expression on Shen Dai\u2019s face at this time made him unable to predict his reactions.Shen Dai lowered his head and combed his emotions quickly. He calmed himself down and then raised his head to meet Qu Moyu\u2019s inquiring gaze: \u201cMr. Qu, I will not marry you.\u201dQu Moyu thought that he had heard it wrong.\u201cYou\u2019re right. What you\u2019re looking for is a partner. I don\u2019t have the strength to cooperate with you as a partner.\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s eyes narrowed: \u201cAre you aware of what you are talking about?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m aware.\u201d Shen Dai asked back, \u201cBut are you aware?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was maybe due to the previous \u2018mark\u2019 between ys, you were too uncomfortable during the susceptible period and thought you needed me. I suggest you receive treatment instead of treating this need as you having feelings for me. Have you forgotten? You have no feelings.\u201d Shen Dai said blankly, \u201cListen to what your intention was. It seems that the person you \u2018like\u2019 is more important than your marriage partner? We are both adults. It\u2019s not easy for anyone to be fooled into marrying you. You will get everything before and after in your life through your common descendants. First you wanted me as your mistress since having an illegitimate child can only bring you down. You think that I like you and you know that I have no background. But you later found out that I disagreed. So you threatened me with custody and lured me in with marriage. Do you think I should be grateful? If I really want to marry you, the prenuptial agreement to be signed should not be thinner than the previous one. If I can\u2019t give birth to an S-class alpha, you will have to find someone else to give birth to one for you. Mr. Qu is worthy of being a businessman.\u201dThis stern accusation made Qu Moyu\u2019s face turn blue and white. His eyes were cold and his heart was so painful that he couldn\u2019t breathe. The promise he made to Shen Dai was degraded by Shen Dai into a mere calculation.Without waiting for him to speak, Shen Dai continued: \u201cI said this not to negotiate terms with you. Not to raise prices. Not to play hard-to-get. Not to coerce you or to raise a bet. I\u2019ve told you from the beginning to the end, I don\u2019t want a single cent of your money.\u201dHe clenched his fists. His eyes were fierce. He really wanted to push Shen Dai to the ground, do everything he wanted to do, tie this person to his side, conquer, control, possess\u2026 Obviously just a little pheromone can help him do it. Let this omega who has repeatedly rejected him become a slut kneeling at his feet. It was something he can do without extra effort. Why make himself so embarrassed like this?!He just\u2026 He just couldn\u2019t bear it. He was just afraid that Shen Dai would look at him with fear and resentment again.He said ruthlessly: \u201cShen Dai, what do you want? Just say it. If you dare to say it, I will definitely give it.\u201d Do you want marriage? Property? Commitment? \u2026 My \u2018Mark\u2019?Shen Dai looked at Qu Moyu with a look of disappointment in the end and only felt pity for him: \u201cYou will never understand.\u201d You regard yourself as the truth in this small world. You never care about the feelings and dignity of the weak. You wantonly plunder and trample over likes and dislikes. You carefully calculate the rate of return on your efforts. You put interests first in everything. And you think that money and power can be exchanged for everything. People like you will never understand.Qu Moyu stood up and stepped closer towards Shen Dai: \u201cWhat do you want to say? What do you want from me? I like you. I really like you!\u201dShen Dai looked directly into Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes: \u201cYou once said that this feeling is not important.\u201d\u2018Like\u2019 was such a cheap feeling. What can an S-class alpha exchange it for?Qu Moyu trembled all over and looked at Shen Dai blankly. That\u2019s right, he said that himself. He said that the feeling of \u2018liking\u2019 someone was not important. It was just one of thousands of emotions. Any omega who wants to use emotions to control him was extremely stupid. But, but\u2026But he likes Shen Dai. But he actually likes Shen Dai so much.He would actually break his own principles and the beliefs that he had all his life. He wanted to marry an ordinary omega just to get the feeling of \u2018like\u2019 that he had once sneered at.Is he crazy? Or is the world crazy?\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.08.01\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: Aaaahhhhh I really want to punch QMY in the face! I\u2019m really sorry, you guys.

But his emotions never left the centre of the storm. It should be said that since the moment he was forced to return to Qu\u2019s house, his body and mind were stuck together in the sinking mud. The more you struggle, the deeper you sink.Today he was not suitable to meet anyone. But after he sent the paper to the teacher for guidance, the teacher took his time out to see him. The teacher had no reason for wasting his time, so he hurried over after handing Qiuqiu to the nanny.When he sat there slowly tasting a cup of hand-ground coffee, looking at the hurried office workers across the large floor-to-ceiling windows, he did realise the benefits of having someone share the burden of raising children for him.When Liu Xi and Cheng Zimei arrived, Shen Dai stood up and showed his first sincere smile in a while.Liu Xi\u2019s eyes were mixed with all kinds of emotions: \u201cSit down.\u201dThe three people\u2026 as master and apprentices sat down. No one started to talk first. There was only silence flowing in the air.Cheng Zimei couldn\u2019t stand the atmosphere anymore so she pretended to be relaxed and asked, \u201cIs Qiuqiu okay?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s fine. He\u2019s a little fatter.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the same every month.\u201d Liu Xi coughed lightly, \u201cWho will take care of him now?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a nanny.\u201d Shen Dai knew what they wanted to ask, so he took the initiative to say, \u201cThe nanny that Qu Moyu hired. I live in his house now.\u201dThere was another moment of silence.Shen Dai understands their embarrassment very well. Regarding his relationship with Qu Moyu, as well as his and Qiuqiu\u2019s identities, these are not so decent topics. It is not easy for him to talk about it. But his teacher and his friend cared about him, so he could only take the initiative to be honest: \u201cI originally wanted to go to work with Senior Brother Bai. But he wouldn\u2019t let me take Qiuqiu with me. So I\u2019ll stay in the capital for the time being.\u201d Shen Dai lowered his head, \u201cAbout my paper\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThen go back to work.\u201d Liu Xi said.Shen Dai looked at his teacher in surprise.\u201cYour SCI still has a lot of room for improvement. If you had a good experimental environment, you could have produced more solid data. Now it has not reached the level I expected you to achieve. You should come back and improve it.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s lips trembled lightly. Why didn\u2019t he want to return to the career he loved? But his life was already in ruins and he felt helpless, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 how to go back.\u201d\u201cHow to go back? Just go back normally.\u201d Liu Xi said with a natural expression, \u201cYour resignation has not been approved. You are still an employee of Xingzhou Research Institute. You just took a long sick leave and now you are cured. So you came back.\u201dCheng Zimei nodded vigorously on the side: \u201cYes. It is reasonable for you to come back to work after taking sick leave.\u201dShen Dai was very moved. Under the pressure of Qu Moyu, they were helping him as much as possible. They never gave up on him. How could he give up on himself? However, is this really as simple as he thinks it is?Liu Xi looked at Shen Dai with steady and determined eyes: \u201cAh Dai, you have given birth to a child now and someone has shown you that it is time to come back to work. No matter what, your career is yours and you must not give it up. \u201c\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to ask about your relationship with Mr. Qu. And I can\u2019t judge. I know you\u2019re also very confused and helpless. So I can only tell you that if you can\u2019t see the road ahead clearly, you should walk well first on this road. You do what you have to do and don\u2019t care about what others think.\u201dCheng Zimei also said: \u201cAh Dai, don\u2019t have too many burdens. Our teacher is right. You have to come back to work and write your thesis. No one can solve all the problems in life at once. You have to do what you can do for now.\u201dA burst of courage was injected into Shen Dai\u2019s chest. There is not a day when he does not miss his old self who is dedicated to his career. He has self-confidence, ideals and goals. He feels that his life is full of hope. It\u2019s not that all souls and flesh are trapped in the cage constructed by Qu Moyu. If this goes on, he will only be overwhelmed by resentment and pain.Even if he has a chance to take Qiuqiu away one day, he at least has to have a job.Shen Dai\u2019s hand on his knee quietly clenched into a fist and he nodded vigorously: \u201cTeacher, thank you.\u201dLiu Xi patted Shen Dai on the shoulder: \u201cAh Dai, you are a tough, smart and hard-working person. I believe you can bring your life back on track.\u201dShen Dai forced a smile: \u201cI hope I won\u2019t let my teacher down.\u201d***When Shen Dai returned to Qu\u2019s house, Aunt Lan and the nanny were pushing a stroller and taking Qiuqiu to bask in the sun in the garden. He was originally worried that Qiuqiu would cry if he left for an afternoon. But as a result, Qiuqiu didn\u2019t delay anything in his eating, sleeping, and playing. And he didn\u2019t cry. While Shen Dai felt relieved, he was also a little disappointed.Seeing that Qiuqiu had adapted to the new environment so quickly and was able to accept the care of others, it meant that he could be relieved of part of his child-rearing work and go out to work. But he hadn\u2019t told Qu Moyu yet and he didn\u2019t know how Qu Moyu would react.In fact, when Qu Moyu said the phrase \u2018marry you\u2019 today, he was moved. Even if it was only for a moment. It was the moment he once dreamed and longed for. Even though he no longer wanted it now. He didn\u2019t know how long the struggle with Qu Moyu would last. It took him more than a year and he still couldn\u2019t get rid of the humiliation and pain that Qu Moyu brought him. And now he was forced to do it all over again. In the past, Madam Qu helped him escape from the abyss, but now, he\u2019s afraid that he is the only one who can save himself.***Qu Moyu didn\u2019t come back for dinner and he didn\u2019t come back until Shen Dai went to bed. He came back with the smell of alcohol around him.Shen Dai buried his face in the pillow and pretended to sleep without saying a word.Qu Moyu walked to the bed and stroked Shen Dai\u2019s hair lightly with his hand. He then got up and went to the bathroom.Shen Dai listened to the sound of footsteps, the sound of the door closing, and the sound of water. In the dark, he could distinguish every step of Qu Moyu with his ears. It was impossible for him to fall asleep.Qu Moyu came out of the bathroom. He stepped on the thick plush carpet and there was almost no sound that could be heard. But the invisible sense of oppression allowed Shen Dai to clearly perceive his approach. He lifted the quilt and lay down. He took hold of Shen Dai\u2019s waist, pulled his omega into his arms and whispered, \u201cI know you\u2019re awake. Stop pretending.\u201dThere is still a faint smell of alcohol on Qu Moyu\u2019s body. It was mixed with the cold and astringent woody aroma of ebony wood. They formed a unique atmosphere of hard, prudent, and cold. It was as if they were blended with the darkness and engulfed Shen Dai completely.\u201cWhere did you go this afternoon?\u201d Qu Moyu put his hand into Shen Dai\u2019s pyjamas.The cold hand made Shen Dai shiver and he said, \u201cI met my teacher.\u201d\u201cWhat did your teacher say?\u201dShen Dai hesitated: \u201cHe wanted me to go back to work.\u201d\u201cOkay. You can do whatever you want. As long as you don\u2019t leave me.\u201d Qu Moyu put the tip of his nose on Shen Dai\u2019s gland and sniffed fascinatedly, \u201cAh Dai, you smell so good.\u201dShen Dai couldn\u2019t stop the invasion of Qu Moyu\u2019s alpha pheromone. This smell is sexy and mysterious. It is also very charming. The stronger the alpha, the more delusional the pheromone is. It can cause endless fantasies. Not only sexual fantasies, but also fantasies of love, beauty, control, and power. The reason why S-class alphas stand on top of the world is because they were born with all these things and can use their pheromones to instil dreams onto others.Shen Dai pinched himself hard, trying to exchange pain with sobriety.Qu Moyu\u2019s fingers followed the position in his memory and found the scar left by the caesarean section on Shen Dai\u2019s lower abdomen. He gently traced the bulge.Shen Dai\u2019s body tensed.\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d Qu Moyu asked in Shen Dai\u2019s ear. He thought of how painful and helpless Shen Dai was when he was not around. When he thought of Shen Dai going through this, he felt a huge sense of guilt. It was precisely because of his absence that Shen Dai had to be dissected. Without the support of alpha pheromones, the natural production of omega would be very harmful.Shen Dai didn\u2019t answer. Of course it was painful. But he was given anaesthesia anyway.\u201cI won\u2019t let you hurt again in the future. I will find the best doctor and nursing care for you. And I will always be by your side.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s lips almost touched Shen Dai\u2019s ear, \u201cAh Dai, I\u2019ll give you more. We\u2019ll have a few more children.\u201d These sentences pronounced by him had a distinct nasal tone. It seemed that he had drunk too much.Shen Dai felt his scalp numb as he felt that the \u2018thing\u2019 against his ass was getting bigger and harder. He struggled in a panic.\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d Qu Moyu hugged Shen Dai\u2019s waist tightly. He endured the pain and bumped his dick a few times. He had never felt so aggrieved in his life and said through gritted teeth, \u201cIf you move again, I will fuck you right now and get you pregnant with my child.\u201dShen Dai really didn\u2019t dare to move. His hand grabbed the sheet nervously.Qu Moyu\u2019s breathing became heavier and heavier. He closed his eyes and hugged Shen Dai in his arms. The scent of the ephemeral flowers made him fascinated in his dreams. He was drunk and his desire was stronger than usual. He had the ability to do whatever he wanted. But he still chose restraint.After a while, Qu Moyu had suppressed his urge. He kissed Shen Dai\u2019s gland: \u201cI\u2019m serious. We won\u2019t only have Qiuqiu. It\u2019s better to have an omega too, like you.\u201dShen Dai closed his eyes tightly, which was probably a kind of compensation in his consciousness. Because he couldn\u2019t close his ears. At this moment, he wanted to shut down all of his senses and prevent everything belonging to Qu Moyu from invading him.\u201cWe will get married. We will have a family. And we will have several children. Isn\u2019t it good?\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s voice became hoarse, revealing his heavy sadness, \u201cAh Dai, isn\u2019t it good?\u201dShen Dai\u2019s eyes were hot and his heart seemed to be hammered. The pain made him overwhelmed. Why did he have to hear all this? He no longer believes any word this person said. But why does his heart still pound loudly?\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.08.02\u058d\u058d\u058dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shen Dai got out of bed and looked back at the sleeping Qu Moyu. The S-class alpha is wrapped in a soft quilt. There was a little bit of his usual sharpness remaining on his face but this undefended appearance gives the illusion of the two of them being close.It was just an illusion.Shen Dai retracted his gaze and tiptoed out of the room.At this time, Qiuqiu hadn\u2019t woken up yet. But the nanny had already got up to prepare hot milk for him.\u201cMr. Shen, you got up so early.\u201d\u201cWell, in the morning\u2026\u201d Shen Dai suddenly felt a little embarrassed, \u201cI\u2019m usually used to waking up to go to work.\u201d It seems that such a common thing as going to work seems to have happened a long time ago that when he mentioned this again now, he felt uneasy.\u201cYou went to work? What kind of work did you do?\u201d\u201cI studied rare earths.\u201d\u201cWhat are rare earths?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s some metal elements extracted from minerals and has many, many usages.\u201dThe nanny said in surprise, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Mr. Shen to be working on such a great job.\u201dShen Dai smiled. He knew that the nanny was not malicious, but he also knew that before that, in the eyes of the other party, he was just an omega who relied on the rich by giving birth to his child.The nanny warmed up the milk. Shen Dai had just taken it from her when Qu Moyu suddenly knocked on the door and came in. He was only wearing his pyjamas and his hair was a little dishevelled. He seemed to be running over in a hurry. After seeing Shen Dai, he looked relieved: \u201cYou disappeared early in the morning. You are indeed here.\u201dShen Dai ignored him and walked to Qiuqiu\u2019s bed. He looked at his watch: \u201cIt\u2019s almost time to wake up.\u201d It would be the longest day that he and Qiuqiu were separated. He was worried that Qiuqiu would not be able to bear it. He felt reluctant to let him bear it.Qu Moyu walked over: \u201cLet me try it.\u201dShen Dai couldn\u2019t stop him from trying to advance his relationship with Qiuqiu every day, so he had to hand him the bottle: \u201cI hold him, you feed.\u201dQu Moyu smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019ll listen to my wife.\u201dShen Dai was stunned for a moment but then immediately lowered his head and held Qiuqiu. Qiuqiu made a small murmur and complained for a while before his eyelids trembled and wanted to open.Qu Moyu handed the pacifier to Qiuqiu\u2019s lips. Qiuqiu smelled the fragrance of milk, and immediately took the pacifier skillfully and sucked it up beautifully.As he was sucking and sucking, he woke up. Qiuqiu opened his eyes, looked at Shen Dai, and then looked at Qu Moyu. He was stunned for a moment. His mouth was open. The milk that he hadn\u2019t swallowed was mixed with saliva. The corners of his mouth came out.Shen Dai quickly took a saliva towel to wipe him.Qu Moyu released a soothing pheromone and patted Qiuqiu lightly: \u201cQiuqiu, daddy will feed you. Eat well.\u201dQiuqiu blinked and gave Shen Dai a pitiful look, as if he wanted to find someone to call the shots for him. But with the bottle in Qu Moyu\u2019s hand, he hesitated for a while, and tried to make a choice as to which is more important. So he continued drinking with Qu Moyu holding the bottle.The three adults in the room breathed a sigh of relief at the same time.Qu Moyu couldn\u2019t hide his excitement and said to Shen Dai, \u201cLook, he didn\u2019t cry. He didn\u2019t cry when I was so close to him. He can accept my pheromones.\u201dShen Dai didn\u2019t want to see this scene: \u201cHe\u2019s just hungry. Right now he\u2019s even more anxious to drink milk.\u201d\u201cNo matter what, it\u2019s getting better than before.\u201d Qu Moyu said with a smile, \u201cEvery day is a little better than before.\u201dShen Dai looked at Qiuqiu with a sweet face and he was even more worried. He was worried that Qiuqiu had already developed feelings and dependence on Qu Moyu if one day he would be able to leave.After feeding the child, Shen Dai washed up, changed his clothes, packed his backpack, and prepared to go downstairs for breakfast. He looked at himself in the mirror. Although he was thinner and haggard, there was a little more precipitation between his brows and eyes. He didn\u2019t care whether he would look older or not with his appearance, he just hoped that he could live up to his name.He remembered what the teacher said \u2013 if you can\u2019t see the road ahead clearly, you should walk well first on this road.When he came to the dining room, Qu Moyu was already at the table and was chatting with the newly hired nutritionist.When Shen Dai appeared, everyone in the dining room looked at him.Shen Dai walked over calmly. He looked at the breakfast on the table and determined that the fish maw porridge was specially prepared for him. Since he returned to Qu\u2019s house, every meal was different from others.\u201cAh Dai, come to eat.\u201d Qu Moyu smiled faintly, \u201cIf you want anything else to eat, or something is not to your taste, please tell them at any time.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Shen Dai nodded to a few people, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to open a small stove for me, these foods are already good.\u201d\u201cYour body needs to be nourished to make you gain a bit more weight.\u201dThe nutritionist smiled and said: \u201cMr. Shen, I have formulated a 21-day diet plan for you according to the requirements of Mr. Qu and your physical condition. Each day will be adjusted according to your feedback. Do you need to take a look??\u201d\u201cNo, there\u2019s no need.\u201d Shen Dai looked at the overly rich breakfast in front of him and suddenly felt that he had no appetite.\u201cOkay, then I will follow the plan for the time being. You can make any suggestions at any time. The important thing is your taste and health.\u201dShen Dai felt uncomfortable being seen this way by everyone. It was as if he suddenly became a sick patient who needed special care.After eating, Qu Moyu insisted that Shen Dai would ride in his own car to go to work, but Shen Dai was unwilling: \u201cIs my bicycle still there?\u201dAfter he came back, all the clothes and daily necessities he had used were there. It was as if the guest room had not been changed since he left, so his bicycle probably should not have been thrown away.\u201cYes, but you won\u2019t have to use it again.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cMy omega can\u2019t ride a bicycle to work or take the subway.\u201d Qu Moyu held the door and made a \u2018please\u2019 gesture, \u201cGet in the car.\u201dShen Dai looked at his watch. He would be late if he continued to stalemate. He couldn\u2019t be late on the first day after returning to work.Qu Moyu closed the car door for Shen Dai and got in the car himself. He adjusted his clothes and glanced at the person beside him with a smile. A sense of satisfaction suddenly flooded into his heart: \u201cWe used to go to work together like this several times before.\u201dShen Dai said: \u201cI can\u2019t ride in your car all the time, I will be seen\u2026\u201d\u201cLet them see it.\u201d Qu Moyu said uncaringly.Shen Dai was stunned.\u201cBut you really can\u2019t take my car all the time. My itinerary is not fixed. Sometimes I don\u2019t go to the company first. I often have to meet clients. When I have to come back late, I will arrange for you a special car and a driver.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want these. It makes me uncomfortable.\u201d Shen Dai whispered.Qu Moyu looked at Shen Dai and suddenly reached out his hand. He pulled his slightly long bangs behind his ears: \u201cYou will have to get used to it sooner or later.\u201dShen Dai sighed in his heart.When he arrived at the company parking lot, Shen Dai saw that there were several cars and people moving outside. It was the rush hour for work and even the exclusive parking space for the CEO was not deserted. There were high-rise cars all around.Lao Wu got out of the car and opened the door for Shen Dai first. Shen Dai bit the bullet and walked out.Qu Moyu said: \u201cAt noon, the house will send you a special nutritious meal. Don\u2019t eat in the cafeteria. And don\u2019t eat fast food outside.\u201dShen Dai walked quickly without looking back.Getting out of Qu Moyu\u2019s car under the watchful eyes of others is just the first test he will have to face today. He has to go back to the place where he used to work and face a group of acquaintances and accept their words or eyes.When he arrived at the research institute, Shen Dai felt uneasy in his heart. But on the surface, he walked in calmly. Liu Xi greeted him in advance and his colleagues didn\u2019t show much exaggeration when they saw him. But the curiosity in the expression during the greetings could not be hidden at all.Cheng Zimei was afraid that he would be embarrassed so she picked him up from the door and led him straight to the office: \u201cI still keep your previous office for you.\u201dAs soon as he entered the office and closed the door, Shen Dai let out a big sigh of relief. He looked at Cheng Zimei. Seeing that Cheng Zimei was also looking at him, the two looked at each other and smiled bitterly.\u201cDon\u2019t think too much. The teacher had already explained it for you. They won\u2019t ask you anything. You came back to work and you don\u2019t need to explain your private affairs to anyone.\u201dShen Dai forced a smile: \u201cBut what they will say in private, no one can control it.\u201d\u201cSo what? You don\u2019t need to care so much about other people\u2019s opinions.\u201d Cheng Zimei walked to the bookshelf and fiddled with Shen Dai\u2019s certificates and medals. \u201cThis is the research institute. Let\u2019s talk using our strengths.\u201dShen Dai also looked at the honours he had won in the past. Sitting in the familiar office, he remembered the academic ideals he once pursued. At this moment, it seemed that a fire was rekindling in his chest.***On the first morning when he came back to work, Shen Dai was busy sorting out the past work process. His absence for more than a year had a great impact on him. Several topics he had followed in the past had progressed to varying degrees and he had to make up many classes for it.This morning was not very comfortable. Due to psychological effects, he could not face his former colleagues completely. Although everyone behaved very naturally, he felt guilty. At the same time, his stomach was also a little uncomfortable. Maybe that breakfast was too nutritious. He obviously didn\u2019t eat too much but he was still a little nauseated.At noon, everyone was going out to eat. Cheng Zimei said that there was a Thai restaurant opposite the company, which was opened after he left and she wanted to take him to try it.Shen Dai had forgotten that Qu Moyu said that the house wanted to deliver meals to him but he still didn\u2019t plan to go out to eat. He wanted to buy only a bottle of milk for lunch so as not to spit out anything that he had eaten.Just as the colleagues were walking out, there was a sudden commotion at the door.The two of them looked towards the commotion in confusion and saw that Qu Moyu was walking in against the flow of people. He was tall and had long legs. He also had a superb appearance and temperament. He stood out in the crowd.Shen Dai froze. The only thought in his mind at that moment was to run.But it was only in his mind. In reality, where can he run?Qu Moyu nodded to the people who greeted him and walked straight towards Shen Dai with a bag in his hand.Cheng Zimei narrowed her eyes and silently took a few steps to the side.Qu Moyu walked to Shen Dai\u2019s side and handed him the bag as usual: \u201cI just delivered food from home. You can eat it while it\u2019s still hot.\u201dShen Dai looked at Qu Moyu in disbelief. At the same time, he felt the eyes around him pierced like rays.Qu Moyu looked around casually and found the intern named Zhou Lan not far away. No, he is now a full-time employee. This kid who once had a crush on Shen Dai will be around Shen Dai in the future. After getting along for a long time in one environment, he hoped that Zhou Lan would be smart enough and aware of current affairs, but he was still a little anxious. So he simply came over to \u2018observe\u2019.Zhou Lan came into contact with Qu Moyu\u2019s gaze and lowered his eyes unconsciously.Qu Moyu said in a loud enough voice that everyone around him could hear: \u201cI originally wanted to eat with you but I have a dinner party at noon. So I have to leave now. You have a good meal. I will pick you up after I get off work.\u201dShen Dai took the lunch in his hands. He already did a whole morning\u2019s psychological construction. He didn\u2019t care about other people\u2019s eyes and evaluations. He returned to work naturally and focused on his scientific research career.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.08.03\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: Hmm\u2026 I\u2019d have to say I was quite amused with QMY coming to \u2018observe\u2019 like that.

    "Chapter 86": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTitle: \u9876\u7ea7\u63a0\u98df\u8005 (Alpha Predator)Author\uff1a\u6c34\u5343\u4e1e (ShuiQianCheng)Translator: K (@kin0monogatari)Protagonists \uff1a\u6c88\u5cb1 (Shen Dai -MC), \u77bf\u672b\u4e88 (Qu Moyu -ML)\u058d\u058d\u058dAfter Qu Moyu left, Shen Dai hid in his office with the lunch box. Lunch is of course also carefully prepared. He used to like Chef Qu\u2019s cooking skills. It was light and nutritious and tasted very good, but now he has no appetite. But he is reluctant to waste food. So he reluctantly took a few bites. It was even more uncomfortable for him. He even ran to the toilet and retched for a while.Shen Dai spent almost the whole afternoon in the office after that.One reason is that he needs to readjust his physical and mental state. Meanwhile, the other reason is that he is not at ease with Qiuqiu being left at home. So he has to check the surveillance video or with the nanny from time to time.Since Qiuqiu was born, this was the first time that the two had been separated for so long. The child must have been difficult to adapt to at first. He would be crying and crying. He couldn\u2019t even be comforted by the video. So the nanny put him in Shen Dai\u2019s clothes pile, but the effectiveness is also limited. Shen Dai looked distressed and anxious, but this step of \u2018withdrawal\u2019 had to be done sooner or later. He began to consider whether to go to the hospital to extract some glandular fluid for Qiuqiu.As soon as the off-duty time came, Shen Dai picked up his bag and left. He planned to take the subway first and then take a taxi after leaving the subway station so that he could get home as quickly as possible during the rush hour.After squeezing into the subway, just as he stood firm, his cell phone rang. It was a call from Qu Moyu. He pressed mute and hung up after the phone rang for a long time, pretending not to hear it.The subway was crowded with people. He grabbed the pole and wanted to move towards the door. But after taking a few steps, he gave up. The air-conditioning circulated in the compartment, but there were too many people. The smell of various alphas and omegas was mixed together, which naturally would not smell good.After leaving the subway station, Shen Dai went to the nearest pharmacy to buy a box of stomach medicine and ate it on the spot. The Qu family must have all kinds of regular medicines, but if Aunt Lan and the others knew about it, they would make a fuss about it.After getting into the taxi, he turned on his mobile phone again and found that Qu Moyu had made five or six calls and asked him where he was. He threw the mobile phone into his backpack.When he got home, Shen Dai trotted into the room. Qiuqiu whimpered aggrievedly when he saw him. Looking at the red and swollen eyelids, he obviously had cried a lot today.Shen Dai was very distressed. He hugged Qiuqiu and kissed him several times. He whispered to Qiuqiu telling him why he was out today, why he was working, and what he was doing. He felt that Qiuqiu could understand him. Not the language. Instead, understand the emotions, and then slowly accept them.After less than half an hour, Qu Moyu came back. Shen Dai felt nervous when he heard the familiar sound of the engine in the yard.Soon, footsteps came from outside the door. The knocking on the door also seemed impatient. With three \u2018bang bang bang\u2019, Qu Moyu pushed open the door with a forbearance of anger on his face.Qiu Qiu was silent immediately. His big eyes rolled around and his expression became nervous.Shen Dai whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t scare the child.\u201dQu Moyu gave the nanny a wink and the nanny came over: \u201cMr. Shen, let me take Qiuqiu to see the fish in the yard.\u201dShen Dai didn\u2019t move. The nanny looked at Qu Moyu awkwardly and left the room lightly.Qu Moyu stood at the door, feeling restless in his heart. His omega was cold and resistant to him. And he didn\u2019t even dare to approach his son at will. How did he end up in such a situation? He said with a sullen face, \u201cI said I would pick you up at night.\u201dShen Dai glanced at Qu Moyu and said lightly, \u201cI didn\u2019t hear the phone. I\u2019m in a hurry to come back to see Qiuqiu.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why do you have to resist when I treat you well?\u201dShen Dai only felt that his temples were throbbing and his anger had rushed to his head. But he knew that no matter what he said or did, Qu Moyu couldn\u2019t understand or change anything.\u201cIs it because I went to see you at noon?\u201d Qu Moyu narrowed his eyes, \u201cI\u2019m worried that you won\u2019t fit in when you go back to work. I want them to pay more attention to you. I\u2019ve never brought an affair into the company. But because it\u2019s you\u2026 \u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk like you\u2019re doing it for me.\u201d Shen Dai glared at Qu Moyu, \u201cDon\u2019t forget that you still have a fianc\u00e9e and the whole company has not forgotten about it either.\u201dQu Moyu frowned.\u201cOf course. Mr. Qu feels that I should be grateful to the Gods for being your mistress. As an S-class alpha, anything you give me is a gift. My colleagues won\u2019t think highly of me, but they will definitely think of respecting you first.\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s lips were trembling in anger.Qiuqiu noticed these emotional changes and immediately became nervous.Qu Moyu felt a few punches in his heart for a while: \u201cI said that I will break off the engagement and the news will be announced in the media soon. I just want everyone to know that you are my omega. Whatever I am doing for you, are you going to interpret them as malicious?!\u201dShen Dai took a breath and said sternly, \u201cYou want everyone to know that I am your mistress. Then, no one will believe how much I struggled for my studies, how much I struggled to enter the research institute, and achieve the achievements I made. The awards that I got, including all the achievements in the future, will all be attributed to having you as a backer. And you will still be proud to provide such good conditions for your mistress while my personal efforts and struggles will not be worth anything!\u201dQu Moyu was stunned. He never expected that Shen Dai would think so. For him, publicly identifying an omega in a place like the company was a promise he had never given to anyone.Qiuqiu trembled and cried. It was the first time he felt that the person he depended on the most was so angry. He didn\u2019t even dare to cry loudly. He could only whimper softly.Shen Dai came back to his senses and quickly coaxed Qiuqiu apologetically: \u201cGood. Good. Dad shouldn\u2019t be so loud, baby\u2026\u201d His nose was sore and the distress in his heart was indescribable.Qu Moyu suddenly felt powerless. He had a kind of pain that he could not convey to Shen Dai. It was as if he did nothing right. Even if he really wanted to be nice to Shen Dai, it was wrong for him.He has never been so eager to please a person or want to be close to a person. Why is this the result? He was angry, aggrieved, annoyed, helpless, and sad. No difficulty he encountered in his life had ever made him feel this way.He couldn\u2019t let go or hold tightly. He didn\u2019t know what to do with Shen Dai.Qu Moyu\u2019s shoulders dropped and he said in a hoarse voice, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for it to be that way.\u201dShen Dai knew that Qu Moyu didn\u2019t mean to make people feel that he was being raised by him. But he just didn\u2019t care. His eyes above the clouds could not see the dignity and ideals, achievements and values of an inferior omega. He never regarded an omega to be an equal person. He only thought of giving \u2018good\u2019 things only in the way that he thinks of what is \u2018good\u2019 to be given.Shen Dai hugged Qiuqiu and turned his back. His body was shaking lightly.After a long silence in the room, Qu Moyu said again, \u201cIs it because you are not satisfied with what I do?\u201dShen Dai remained silent. Qu Moyu stared at his back for a while before opening the door and left.Shen Dai put Qiuqiu back in the crib and sat down. He suddenly felt exhausted both physically and mentally.His phone vibrated. He picked it up and saw that it was Bai Xiangwan who sent a message: I will take Xiao Die to attend an academic seminar in Beijing.Followed by another: I just want to see you and Qiuqiu.Shen Dai stared at the dialog box for a long time, not knowing how to respond. He misses Bai Xiangwan and Xiao Die. He especially missed Xiao Die taking care of them for so long. Qiuqiu also has a deep relationship with Xiao Die. He thought he would go back soon, so he didn\u2019t say goodbye formally. It\u2019s just that he is now stuck in this situation. He doesn\u2019t have the face to see them.But it is impossible for him to disappear completely. He thought about it for a long time and replied: Great. I\u2019ll see you next week.At this moment, there was a knock on the door. Aunt Lan came to deliver the meal.\u201cAh Dai, the young master said you were coaxing Qiuqiu and asked me to bring you dinner.\u201dShen Dai adjusted her mood and smiled, \u201cThank you, Aunt Lan.\u201dAunt Lan put the tray on the table and came over to see Qiuqiu: \u201cI\u2019ll see him for a while. You can eat first. You came to coax the child as soon as you get back from work, you must be hungry.\u201dShen Dai wanted to say that he was not hungry at all. Not only was he not hungry, but he had no appetite at all. But if he didn\u2019t eat, it would definitely attract the attention of the nutritionist or Qu Moyu. So he could only force himself to eat something, although he was really repulsed\u2026And what\u2019s more!!Shen Dai was scared into a cold sweat by his sudden realisation. Does his reaction mean that his estrus period is coming? !From the time of his pregnancy to the birth of Qiuqiu, he has not been in estrus for more than a year. Especially since the washing off of the \u2018mark\u2019, his glands were damaged. So, he had no desire at all and he did not realise that this phenomenon of losing his appetite is very likely to be an indicator that the estrus period is coming.The doctor once said that if he did not enter estrus three months after giving birth, he would need to come to the hospital for treatment. But he didn\u2019t care about it and even thought that it would be a good thing for him if he never had estrus again.But after Qu Moyu appeared, he kept using pheromones to influence him, awakening his glands.Shen Dai\u2019s face turned pale. At this time when he would get in his estrus period, he would have nowhere to hide. During the estrus period, he would obey his alpha\u2019s words and Qu Moyu could make him surrender without much effort.Aunt Lan noticed that Shen Dai looked different and asked worriedly, \u201cAh Dai, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d\u201cNo. There\u2019s nothing.\u201d Shen Dai glanced at the food on the table and his stomach became even more uncomfortable, \u201cAunt Lan, I\u2019ll eat the meal in a while. I want to put Qiuqiu to sleep first.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll coax him so you can eat.\u201d\u201cQiuqiu hasn\u2019t seen me for a day. So now just let me coax him.\u201d Shen Dai forced a smile, \u201cYou can go and do your work first.\u201d\u201cOkay. You should eat more. I see that your body has gotten better these days. Food supplements are the best.\u201dAfter Aunt Lan left, Shen Dai opened the schedule to look at the dates for the academic seminar which had just been released during the day in the work group. The time when Bai Xiangwan and Xiao Die came to Beijing basically coincided with his estrus period. Now, the only way is to ask Xiao Die to help him to take care of Qiuqiu, hide himself and use the inhibitors, and spend a day or two to get through it.He must never let Qu Moyu control him during the estrus period.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.08.04\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: You guys think QMY will miss that opportunity?

It was from his grandmother\u2019s mobile phone. He said that his grandmother was not feeling well today and was in the hospital now. So Shen Dai hurried over.Shen Qin knew that he was right. And when he saw Shen Dai, he was a little embarrassed.This was the first time the two met in more than a year. But Shen Dai didn\u2019t have time to deal with him so he went to see the doctor first.The doctor said that the chemotherapy after the operation was effective at the beginning, but now new lesions have appeared. After all, the old woman is already in her seventies and her health will only deteriorate. In the future, surgery is not recommended. Instead, she will be hospitalised for a period of time. Treatment is based only on minimising her pain.Although the doctor didn\u2019t say it directly, everyone could understand what it meant. Shen Dai felt very uncomfortable, but also very calm. Since the day when his grandmother was diagnosed with gastric cancer, the treatment along these years has already prepared Shen Dai\u2019s psychological foreshadowing. He is ready to accept any ending at any time.After communicating with the doctor about the treatment plan, Shen Dai and Shen Qin decided according to the information.Shen Qin wiped away his tears silently: \u201cAh Dai, what should I do?\u201d\u201cJust cooperate with the doctor.\u201d Shen Dai quickly calculated in his mind how much it would cost and how to adjust the monthly expenditure ratio. Now, he has to use his emergency reserve fund. He doesn\u2019t know how long his grandmother will stay in the hospital. He can just sell the house.\u201cI\u2019m really scared. Your grandma has been getting worse and worse lately.\u201d\u201cGrandma has been sick for many years. This day will come sooner or later.\u201d Shen Dai gave Shen Qin a cold look and turned away. Sometimes when he sees other people\u2019s fathers being kind and filial to their children, he envy and wonder at the same time, why other people\u2019s fathers can support their children but he has a selfish, weak, greedy and stupid father. Without Shen Qin, his grandmother and grandfather might not have gotten sick so early. At the very least, his life should not have been like this. He didn\u2019t have to agree to a marriage agreement for money and he didn\u2019t have to fall into the quagmire that he couldn\u2019t get out of.Shen Dai walked to the door of the ward and caught a glimpse of her grandmother lying on the bed looking weak. He stood outside the door for more than ten seconds, not daring to enter. He thought he was mentally prepared, but seeing his dearest relative moving towards parting step by step, this moment still made him feel sad.Shen Qin said in a low voice, \u201cThere are six people in this ward. The environment is too bad. Let\u2019s change to a single ward.\u201d\u201cWhen the test results come out, let\u2019s see how long this will last.\u201d The single ward is more than three hundred yuan a day and it will cost tens of thousands a month. If she really would be hospitalised for a long time, he can only sell the house. But if the house is sold and the grandmother is discharged from the hospital, where can they live?Shen Qin glanced at Shen Dai cautiously: \u201cYou have given birth to an alpha for the Qu family, this money\u2026\u201dShen Dai glared at Shen Qin fiercely: \u201cHow do you know?\u201dShen Qin\u2019s eyes flickered a little: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your grandma who told me. I can guess it myself. You disappeared for more than a year and this is the right time to have a baby\u2026\u201d He paused, \u201cAfter I hired a nanny, at home, I turned on a nanny cam and saw you with the child.\u201dShen Dai also knew that he couldn\u2019t hide it from Shen Qin for a long time. But he was still like a cat with fried fur, whole-heartedly guarding against Shen Qin if he might come to harm his child.\u201cAh Dai, when you have a child, you can understand the difficulties of your father back then.\u201dShen Dai looked at Shen Qin indifferently: \u201cI did make the same choice as you did back then, but our goals are different. I will never take my child to the door to ask for money and when someone kicks me out, I won\u2019t tell my child that he should not have been born.\u201dShen Qin\u2019s face turned pale in an instant and he became angry for a moment: \u201cDo you really think you are better than me? You give birth to this child and do nothing for it? If that\u2019s the case, then you are stupider than me!\u201dShen Dai\u2019s eyes turned red with anger.The nurse came in with the medicine and scolded: \u201cWhat\u2019s with being noisy? This is the hospital!\u201dShen Dai stopped looking at Shen Qin. He entered the ward and walked to his grandmother\u2019s bed.His grandmother had fallen asleep. He held his grandmother\u2019s hand and was silent for a long time.After a long while, Shen Qin said in a low voice, \u201cAnyway, your grandmother\u2019s illness is more important. I\u2026 I don\u2019t have much money. I went on a trip some time ago and I also bought some things. I can pay a little for the basic expenses of the family. For treatment is\u2026\u201dThere were people walking and talking in the ward from time to time. The old person in the next bed was whimpering uncomfortably. Shen Dai took a deep breath and said tiredly, \u201cLet\u2019s change the ward. To a double room first.\u201d***On the way back, Shen Dai felt a little weak. He took out the nutrient solution from his bag and drank a tube.In order to empty the reproductive cavity before the estrus period, there will be no appetite for about a week. So he can only eat and drink a small amount, with supplements, to maintain the basic consumption of the body. In this case, it is no problem to go to work normally. It is nothing more than poor mental and physical fitness. If he encounters something that makes him anxious, it will exacerbate this feeling of weakness.Thinking of all the pressures he faced, Shen Dai felt breathless. Regarding the coming estrus period, he has temporarily arranged for it. In those two days, he intends to take Qiuqiu to leave the Qu\u2019s house on the grounds of visiting his grandmother. He will spend this estrus period at Cheng Zimei\u2019s house. Cheng Zimei had to go to work, attend the academic exchange meeting, and have to give speeches plus receptions. She must leave early and return late. Xiao Die will come to take care of him and Qiuqiu.However, his grandmother was hospitalised today and he had another headache. This estrus period would come at an extremely untimely time, which made him feel devastated.When he got back to Qu\u2019s house, it was past nine o\u2019clock. During that time, Qu Moyu called as if waiting for him. He only told him that he went to see his grandmother.Seeing him, Qu Moyu stood up: \u201cYou came back so late. Have you eaten yet?\u201d\u201cI have eaten.\u201d\u201cQiuqiu has been crying and looking for you.\u201d Qu Moyu used the next sentence to stop Shen Dai, who was in a hurry to go upstairs, \u201cHe\u2019s asleep now. Don\u2019t go to him.\u201dShen Dai lowered his head wearily.\u201cYou look tired.\u201d Qu Moyu walked up to Shen Dai and touched his head, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Is grandma okay?\u201dShen Dai nodded, not wanting to say more: \u201cI\u2019m going to rest.\u201dShen Dai wanted to see Qiuqiu, but was afraid of waking the child. So, he gave up. He went back to his room, took a quick shower, and threw himself on the bed, not wanting to move at all.Qu Moyu pushed open the door and came in. He leaned on the head of the bed and looked at Shen Dai who had his back turned to him. He wanted to take him into his arms, but he didn\u2019t dare. There\u2019s nothing he can do. He\u2019s constantly approaching the limit of his endurance and just a little spark can set him on fire.He adjusted his breathing evenly, suppressing the increasingly strong impulse: \u201cHow is grandma\u2019s health recently?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s fine.\u201d Shen Dai said softly.\u201cIs there anything you need to tell me?\u201dShen Dai was silent for a while and said, \u201cMy grandma\u2019s birthday is next week. I want to take Qiuqiu back to stay with her for two days. She misses Qiuqiu very much.\u201dQu Moyu stared at the back of Shen Dai\u2019s neck. The scar on the glands are covered by the stubble. His eyes became dark. He said, \u201cOkay.\u201d There\u2019s no telling of his emotions from his voice, \u201cI will prepare a birthday gift for grandma.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Shen Dai turned around. He realised that his reaction was a little big and immediately covered it up by saying calmly, \u201cI don\u2019t want my grandma to know about these things. And I don\u2019t want her to worry about me.\u201d\u201cIf she knows that you have an alpha to take care of you and your child, she won\u2019t worry about you.\u201dShen Dai whispered: \u201cI will explain to her when I have a chance. But not now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ok.\u201dShen Dai lay down again, still with his back to Qu Moyu.Qu Moyu looked at an electronic invitation letter on his mobile phone: \u201cBai Xiangwan will come to the exchange meeting next week.\u201d This academic exchange meeting is sponsored by the Rare Earth Association and is an important annual meeting in the industry. Zhouhui was sponsored and he was naturally invited.Shen Dai was silent.\u201cYou should also go to the meeting. But you are not allowed to see him in private.\u201d Qu Moyu said in an orderly tone, \u201cWhether you want to invite each other to dinner, participate in a dinner party, or if he says he wants to see Qiuqiu, they are not allowed.\u201dShen Dai gritted his teeth.\u201cQiuqiu\u2019s acceptance of me is getting better and better. Soon, he will no longer need Bai Xiangwan\u2019s pheromone. I\u2019m not trying to limit your social freedom. But for an alpha, the relationship between you and Qiuqiu with Bai Xiangwan is intolerable. You should learn to avoid suspicion.\u201d Qu Moyu leaned over and kissed Shen Dai\u2019s glands, \u201cGood boy, promise me.\u201d His tone was gentle. But if he listened deeply, there\u2019s a hint of coldness in it.\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Shen Dai said in a deep voice.***Bai Xiangwan and Xiao Die arrived in the capital on Wednesday. The exchange meeting will last for five to six days. Shen Dai originally wanted to invite them to dinner on Thursday, but considering that there was no one to take care of Qiuqiu, he finally decided to eat at Cheng Zimei\u2019s house.At the same time, he has to make some time to go to the hospital to see his grandmother.On Thursday morning, Shen Dai put all the things that he needed during the estrus period into Qiuqiu\u2019s bag. He took a leave of absence and calculated the time, but if the estrus period does not come as expected, he will be in trouble. He needed a new excuse to explain to Qu Moyu why he didn\u2019t go back to Qu\u2019s house.But now there is no better plan. He could confess after the fact. It is better than being caught by Qu Moyu at his most vulnerable moment.Qu Moyu asked Lao Wu to take them there. He couldn\u2019t refuse, so he could only go home with Qiuqiu first and then take a taxi to Cheng Zimei\u2019s house after Lao Wu left.The last time he stayed at Cheng Zimei\u2019s house, he took a spare key with him. After entering the house, he settled Qiuqiu first. He bought vegetables and wine through his mobile phone and counted his inhibitors and nutrient solutions while waiting for the takeaway.Suddenly, he felt his heart beat faster and his legs were weak. A layer of sweat appeared on his body immediately. This feeling came and went by quickly, but it still shocked him. It means that the estrus period is approaching and it may be one or two days earlier. When the strong fluctuations of this hormone become more and more frequent, it is time to take the inhibitor. According to his past experience, it is likely to be tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow at the latest.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.08.05\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note:\u00a0Pardon any mistakes.

Bai Xiangwan and Xiao Die stood at the door with a smile. Suddenly, the three of them remembered that this scene had appeared countless times when they were in Lancheng and they couldn\u2019t help feeling a little emotional.Bai Xiangwan was wearing a suit today and his hair was styled with hairspray. The whole person presented a straight-forward, handsome, and excellent temperament, which was in great contrast to his usual casual and unruly appearance. His stature and appearance are all outstanding, but the attributes of a science and engineering man are still more prominent. His hair is cut by the barber shop at the entrance of the institution and his clothes which are put on his body are of whenever he catches. People around him often persuade him not to waste his natural good skin and to take care of himself. But he is too lazy to think about it. This kind of specially styled state must be done in order for him to meet important people.\u201cWow, Teacher Shen.\u201d Xiao Die came up and hugged Shen Dai excitedly, \u201cIt feels like I\u2019ve been separated from you for a long time.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only been over a month.\u201d Shen Dai smiled and looked at her, \u201cXiao Die seems to have lost a bit of weight. It seems that your plan for weight loss is very effective.\u201d\u201cI lost six pounds! Qiuqiu! Qiuqiu! Let me see how much he gained.\u201d\u201cThe guest bedroom on the left. You can go and play with him.\u201dXiao Die changed her shoes and ran in.Shen Dai and Bai Xiangwan looked at each other. And then looked away awkwardly: \u201cBrother Bai, come in.\u201dBai Xiangwan entered the room and handed the things in his hand to Shen Dai: \u201cI brought some of your favourite food from Lancheng.\u201dShen Dai saw a familiar packaging bag at a glance and said in surprise, \u201cIsn\u2019t this the sauce duck from the house downstairs? You remember?\u201d\u201cWhy won\u2019t I remember?\u201d Bai Xiangwan smiled and looked at Shen Dai, \u201cWhere\u2019s Zimei?\u201d\u201cShe just told me that she has to work overtime and will be back later.\u201d Shen Dai teased, \u201cBrother Bai is so handsome today.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a dinner meeting at noon.\u201d Bai Xiangwan seemed a little embarrassed. He took off his jacket, \u201cThe suit was custom-made for an event the year before. And Xiao Die styled my hair for me. I\u2019m really not used to dressing like this. I\u2019m not comfortable.\u201d\u201cYou will only feel comfortable by just putting on a white coat.\u201d Shen Dai took his coat with a smile and helped him hang it up, \u201cYou wanna go and see Qiuqiu?\u201dBai Xiangwan hesitated for a moment: \u201cI\u2019ll take a look at you first.\u201dShen Dai was startled. He knew that Bai Xiangwan had something to say: \u201cSit down.\u201dBai Xiangwan sat on the sofa. He looked at Shen Dai with a gentle gaze: \u201cYour complexion has improved. And it seems that you have gained some weight.\u201d\u201cNow that Qiuqiu is watched by a nanny at night, after not staying up late, he is really in better spirits.\u201d Shen Dai looked at Bai Xiangwan, a little hard to say, \u201cI went back to work at the teacher\u2019s place.\u201dBai Xiangwan smiled reluctantly: \u201cI heard so from the teacher. So\u2026 is this a good choice for you?\u201dShen Dai could hear that the \u2018choice\u2019 in Bai Xiangwan\u2019s mouth was not meant for the topic of him returning to Liu Xi\u2019s place to work, but him returning to live by Qu Moyu\u2019s side. He could pretend he didn\u2019t understand, but he didn\u2019t want to avoid it. Especially to someone who had helped him a lot and really cared about him, he said, \u201cSenior Brother Bai, I have decided to stay in Lancheng before, but now\u2026 \u2026it\u2019s not my \u2018choice\u2019 really. I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201dBai Xiangwan\u2019s two sword brows frowned. Anger flashed in his eyes and finally turned into helplessness: \u201cI understand. After all\u2026 you have a child.\u201dShen Dai twisted his fingers tightly: \u201cI\u2019m just sorry for disappointing Senior Brother Bai.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. We\u2019ve known each other for so many years. From college to now, I\u2019ve always been very optimistic about you.\u201d Bai Xiangwan looked at Shen Dai deeply and there were unspeakable feelings hidden in it, \u201cI just hope you will have a good life.\u201dShen Dai said lightly, \u201cIt will get better.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go see Qiuqiu now.\u201dIt is said that children don\u2019t remember things much, but Qiuqiu clearly remembers Xiao Die and Bai Xiangwan. When he was held by Xiao Die, his mouth was so happy that he couldn\u2019t close his mouth. As soon as Bai Xiangwan entered the room, he could smell the sufficient safety for him. The pheromones of white elm\u2026 he was so excited that he babbled.Bai Xiangwan took Qiuqiu from Xiao Die\u2019s arms and the room was full of coaxes. Shen Dai watched from the side with a smile on his face. He originally thought that the time in Lancheng was the most difficult time in his life. Now, looking back, although he suffered a lot of physical and psychological pain, his friends were selfless. Help was really valuable, no matter how tired he was, at least he had no anxiety and anger in his heart. At least he was relatively free.He really wished he hadn\u2019t come back.Xiao Die said, \u201cMr. Shen, are you ready for dinner? I\u2019ll help you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s almost ready. Come and help me make soup.\u201dThe two walked into the kitchen, Xiao Die lowered her voice and said, \u201cMr. Shen, when is your estrus date? Is it set?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not something I can decide.\u201d Shen Dai couldn\u2019t help laughing, \u201cIt\u2019s probably tomorrow or the day after.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never taken care of an omega at home. I have omega friends, but I didn\u2019t accompany them during the estrus period. You teach me how to do it, okay?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous. I just want you to help me take care of Qiuqiu, not me. I can handle my own situation myself.\u201d Shen Dai said, \u201cI will call you then. If it happens to be during the meeting, have you thought about how to ask your teacher for leave?\u201d\u201cI will say I\u2019m not feeling well.\u201d\u201cXiao Die, sorry for troubling you.\u201d Shen Dai said, feeling a little ashamed, \u201cYou came all the way here and I need you to help me take care of the child.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with that? Don\u2019t you also pay for my salary?\u201d Xiao Die smiled, \u201cAnd I like children, especially Qiuqiu.\u201d\u201cWell, when you come here, first, don\u2019t let Senior Brother Bai know. And second, don\u2019t be too nervous about me.\u201d Shen Dai urged, \u201cI will have some reactions, such as looking like I\u2019m sick, uncomfortable and weak. Occasionally, I will lose consciousness. These are normal. You don\u2019t need to worry about me. I will take the inhibitor and it will pass after a day.\u201dXiao Die was stunned for a moment: \u201cIt sounds so serious. Is it always like this in the estrus period?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s always like this.\u201d Shen Dai added in his heart; it\u2019s always like this in the estrus period without alpha.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do some homework ahead of time.\u201dShen Dai smiled: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You can just take care of Qiuqiu.\u201dAfter dinner was done, they chatted while eating. Cheng Zimei came back halfway through the meal and the three of them recalled their college days together. At that time, Bai Xiangwan was the number one male god of their department. Not only was he tall and handsome, but the key was that he was the number one achiever in his major. He also got his direct PhD and he was hired by Xingzhou Research Institute with an annual salary of one million upon graduation. The combination was dazzling.Unexpectedly, Bai Xiangwan did not stay in the capital. But he chose to open up a new mining area in Lancheng, which has nothing. Time has proved that this step has gone well. The capital already has his teacher Liu Xi and he will have to endure for many years. He got an independent subject, but his ambition forced him to stretch his wings and fly higher.Shen Dai admires and yearns to be like Bai Xiangwan. He knows that his talent is a little worse than that of Bai Xiangwan, but he is not completely out of reach. This is his example of hard work.When they were in college, they did an experiment together for a year. At that time, he had a crush on Bai Xiangwan. He guessed that Cheng Zimei was the same. At that time, Bai Xiangwan had a beta boyfriend and he was soon hit hard by a sudden family change.Unexpectedly, after many years, they each have a different future. They have experienced so many things yet they can still sit at a table and talk about the past.Some people have made great strides along the way, such as Bai Xiangwan. Others are slow, but mostly smooth, such as Cheng Zimei. Some people encounter bumps and bumps and sometimes take detours, but they will still meet on a certain road at a certain moment. They clink glasses, and then each embark on a different journey. That\u2019s the wonder of life.***They chatted until very late that day and after sending people away, Shen Dai took a shower and hurriedly lay down. At dinner, in order not to let Bai Xiangwan see the difference, he reluctantly ate a few mouthfuls of meat, which made his stomach feel uncomfortable again.Before going to bed, he turned on the phone that had been muted and saw Qu Moyu\u2019s missed calls and several WeChat messages. He asked him what he was doing, how Qiuqiu was, and how his grandmother was. The last WeChat message was sent ten minutes ago. The content is: If you don\u2019t answer the phone and don\u2019t reply to the messages, I will go to you directly next time.Shen Dai quickly replied: Everything is fine.Shen Dai looked at the dialog box showing that he was typing, stopped typing for a long time, then started typing again, and finally sent a message: Rest early.Shen Dai replied: Okay.Shen Dai was a little impetuous in his heart. He had too many things to worry about and it was difficult to calm down. He turned off the light, closed his eyes, and unsurely opened the bedside table. After groping for his own inhibitor, he forced himself to fall asleep.In the afternoon of the next day, Shen Dai felt that something was wrong and the familiar reaction began to hit his body. He took a tube of an inhibitor. He usually took a dose first. If the symptoms do not subside after four or five hours, he will take another one. After all, this thing will harm the body if taken excessively.He was sweating all over and his hands and feet started to feel weak. He first went to see Qiuqiu who was sleeping and then sent Xiao Die a message.Qiuqiu seemed to feel his omega father\u2019s abnormal pheromone fluctuations in his sleep and there were signs of him waking up. Shen Dai hurriedly left and locked himself in the guest room. The blood was rushing fast and he felt the world spinning for a moment. He had to shrink into the quilt.Half an hour later, Xiao Die came. She ran into the room, looked at Shen Dai who was curled up in the quilt with his back to her, and asked worriedly, \u201cMr. Shen, how are you?\u201dShen Dai said in a trembling voice, \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201dDesires began to come in waves and Shen Dai felt that his body was getting hotter and hotter. It seemed that ants were crawling on his sensitive parts and his body was screaming unspeakable desires.The inhibitor will take effect in about an hour. If the suppression effect is not enough, he will have to take another one. If it is really uncomfortable, he just needs to relieve himself. Shen Dai is already familiar with all the experiences in this process, but he still clearly feels that this time, the estrus period is very violent. Perhaps because he has not had his estrus for more than a year and the delayed desire will fight back fiercely.Xiao Die cautiously walked around to the other side of the bed and saw Shen Dai\u2019s pale complexion. His breath was uneven and his hair was wet. She was startled: \u201cMr. Shen, you\u2026 are you all right?\u201dHe can\u2019t blame Xiao Die for making a fuss. For a person who has never seen an omega in heat, Shen Dai really looks like he has a high fever. He looks very painful and haggard.Shen Dai couldn\u2019t care less about being embarrassed at this time. He said in a hoarse voice, \u201cI\u2019m fine. Can you help me watch Qiuqiu?\u201d\u201cOkay, okay. Just call me if you need anything. No, if it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll take you to the hospital.\u201dShen Dai buried his face in the quilt.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.08.08\u058d\u058d\u058dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was so cold that he had to wrap his body with a quilt, and then felt unbearably hot, so he had to kick the quilt to breathe in some fresh air.He touched his face with his hand. His face was hot, like it was burning. The orbital bones seemed to be constantly tightening and the hoop made his brain hurt and confused. His reason was about to be burned out by lust. He struggled to get up from the bed and stumbled into the bathroom of the guest bedroom. He propped himself against the wall and sat on the toilet. He held his sore dick and stroked it almost roughly. In this unbearable torture, finding a hint of relief, he couldn\u2019t help but let out a cry. But he immediately bit his lip. However, this feeling is only scratching the surface. The emptiness of feeling the real thing is difficult to be satisfied with. The body is constantly screaming to be invaded, marked, and conquered. The floral fragrance from his glands smelled too sweet even for him and he seemed to be drowning in the fragrance.After venting, his body became even weaker. He realised that the estrus period this time was more violent than he had imagined. He would not be able to last for three or five hours. He had to take a second dose of the inhibitor through injection.Staggering back to the bedside, when he bent down to open the bedside table, the soles of his feet softened, and he knelt directly on the ground. He ended up knocking his forehead against the edge of the bedside table with a bang, making him dizzy. Beside the bed, he was dizzy and weak, unable to move for a while. He was half passed out.After an unknown amount of time, he was awakened by Xiao Die\u2019s worried voice. He opened his hazy eyes and saw Xiao Die trying to help him with a panicked face: \u201cMr. Shen, have you fainted? How are you now?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine.\u201d His first gender is male. So, he was still much taller and stronger than Xiao Die. Xiao Die couldn\u2019t move him at all. He gathered up all his strength, propped up on the edge of the bed, and with the help of Xiao Die, he lay back on the bed again.\u201cMr. Shen, I don\u2019t think you can do this. Is the inhibitor not working?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not enough.\u201d Shen Dai pointed weakly at the bedside table, \u201cThere\u2019s still one in there. Help me get another one.\u201dXiao Die took a new inhibitor for him. She tore the package and handed it to Shen Dai. After Shen Dai took it, he wrapped himself in the quilt again. The inhibitor would not take effect soon and he had to continue to endure it.\u201cMr. Shen, you have a lump on your forehead. Did you hit your head?\u201dShen Dai muttered: \u201cIt\u2019s alright\u2026\u201dXiao Die touched Shen Dai\u2019s forehead. It was so hot that she immediately retracted her hand: \u201cMr. Shen, your body temperature is too high!\u201d She had never seen this scene of an omega in heat with her own eyes. But she knows that if a person\u2019s body temperature is too high for a long time, it\u2019s going to be a big problem.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. The inhibitor\u2026\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s voice was so empty that only a breath left, \u201cThe inhibitor will help.\u201d\u201cThen, do you need a nutritional supplement?\u201d Xiao Die also did a lot of homework. But she was still stunned. Shen Dai looked frightened.\u201cI\u2019ve taken it.\u201d Shen Dai forced his chaotic brain to parse and transmit the conversation, \u201cEvery\u2026 five or six hours.\u201dXiao Die looked at her watch: \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll remind you when the time comes.\u201d She stood beside the bed with a frown. She felt uneasy in her heart. Shen Dai\u2019s state at this time was not an exaggeration to describe it as being half-dead. His body temperature was rising. His body was full of heat so he was sweating constantly. His whole body also was as soft as mud. With limited experience and knowledge, it is impossible to analyse that this is a normal process when omega is in an estrus period. There are still problems.Desires brewed and gathered in the body again and his body twitches involuntarily. Shen Dai sank his whole face into the quilt and said in a muffled voice, \u201cXiao Die, you go out. Please\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t be seen masturbating in front of others.Xiao Die came back to her senses: \u201cOh! oh! oh!\u201d She embarrassedly exited the room and closed the door. She went back to the living room and sat beside Qiuqiu\u2019s cradle, while using her mobile phone to continue to check the knowledge about the omega\u2019s sex. She always felt that some of those popular sciences were in line with Shen Dai\u2019s symptoms and some were not. When one article said that the first postpartum period of estrus for an omega would be more violent and unstable than before, she got nervous again.After waiting for more than an hour, Xiao Die saw that the time was almost up. So she took the nutritional supplements from the refrigerator for Shen Dai to take. At this time, Shen Dai could not eat anything else and could only rely on nutritional supplements to supplement his basic energy.When she entered the room, Shen Dai had fainted again. It was probably because his energy was exhausted. She hurriedly shook Shen Dai awake and squeezed a tube of paste-like nutritional supplements into his mouth.Shen Dai\u2019s eyes opened a gap and stared at Xiao Die blankly, looking confused.Xiao Die was overwhelmed with anxiety: \u201cMr. Shen, let\u2019s go to the hospital. I\u2019m scared looking at you like this.\u201dShen Dai didn\u2019t know if he even understood what she had said but he just shook his head weakly.At this moment, Xiao Die\u2019s cell phone rang in the living room. She put Shen Dai down and went to answer the phone. The caller ID was Bai Xiangwan.Xiao Die took a deep breath and answered the phone: \u201cHello, teacher.\u201d\u201cXiao Die, I\u2019m done with the meeting. Are you feeling better now? Do you need any medicine?\u201dBai Xiangwan\u2019s voice was calm and generous. Even if the background sound is of a noisy venue, it still has a special penetrating power.\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine. Maybe I ate the wrong thing. I\u2019ll just rest.\u201d\u201cThen can you eat anything at night? By the way, yoghourt is good for the stomach\u2026\u201dAt this moment, Qiuqiu suddenly called out and then babbled. He let out a rhythmic cry.There was silence on both ends of the phone.\u201cIs that Qiuqiu?\u201d Bai Xiangwan asked suspiciously.Xiao Die\u2019s head was about to explode, so she didn\u2019t dare to make a sound.\u201cAre you with Shen Dai? Are they in your hotel, or\u2026\u201d Bai Xiangwan paused, \u201cXiao Die, you can ask for leave and tell the truth. There\u2019s no need to lie.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, teacher!\u201d Xiao Die\u2019s mentality finally couldn\u2019t hold back anymore. After all, she was just a little girl who had not graduated yet. She said anxiously, \u201cActually, it was Mr. Shen. He\u2026 he is in estrus period and he wanted me to help him take care of Qiuqiu. He asked me not to tell others. But I\u2026 I feel that his state is not normal. He has a high fever and fainted several times. I am so scared. I, I, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201dBai Xiangwan patiently reassured her: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Xiao Die. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s fine. Okay, speak slowly. Where are you?\u201dBai Xiangwan\u2019s steady voice injected a heavy force into Xiao Die\u2019s flustered heart. She took a deep breath again and really calmed down: \u201cAt Teacher Cheng\u2019s house.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t be afraid. Just look after Shen Dai and Qiuqiu. I\u2019ll be there soon.\u201dIn less than 20 minutes, Bai Xiangwan really arrived. He wore a special mask on his face. It was a pheromone-isolating mask that he bought at a pharmacy just then. This thing can filter omega pheromones in the normal state from 80% to 90%. But only 40% to 50% of the omega who are in estrus can be resisted. After all, the invasion of pheromone to the body is all-round and the respiratory system only accounts for a few parts.But it is better than nothing.Xiao Die said hesitantly: \u201cTeacher, is it okay for you to go in?\u201dBai Xiangwan had already smelled the omega\u2019s fragrance in the air and he said solemnly: \u201cI have good self-control.\u201d\u201cThen please take a look at Mr. Shen. Teacher, Mr. Shen told me that he is fine, that he has always been like this. But I am afraid something will happen to him.\u201dBai Xiangwan walked to the guest room and adjusted his breathing. He opened the door and was welcomed with the confusing fragrance of Epiphyllum. The pervasive attack hit him. His body suddenly heated up and his eyes became dark and obscure. He clenched his fists fiercely and his feet were nailed to the door. He was neither entering nor retreating.After taking the nutritional supplements, Shen Dai regained some physical strength. He rolled unbearably on the bed so the buttons of his pyjamas were loosened, revealing a large area of fair and naked skin. Although the inhibitor has already taken effect, the desire cannot be completely suppressed and it will only be much better if he survives after tonight.At this moment, a clear and gentle pheromone broke through the thick fog and passed to Shen Dai\u2019s neurons. His body trembled. He turned his head laboriously and saw a familiar figure standing at the door. The light in the room was dim and the face could not be seen clearly. But the woody fragrance of elm drifted out in layers.Shen Dai whimpered in pain and his reason was shouting to warn him not to do anything rash. But instinct made him yearn to be appeased by an alpha. He slowly shrank into the bed, but his eyes were fixed on Bai Xiangwan. The fluctuation of pheromones became more and more strong and uncontrollable. He wants to show his soft belly to lure the attack of the beast.Bai Xiangwan grabbed the door frame with one hand, with such force that his joints turned blue. He bit his lip, walked over, and carefully breathed: \u201cAh Dai, your current situation is not right. I will take you to the hospital.\u201dShen Dai stared blankly at Bai Xiangwan and whispered, \u201cSenior brother\u2026\u201d He stretched out his hand and grabbed the hem of Bai Xiangwan\u2019s clothes. His moist eyes were full of pleading, \u201cSenior brother, help me\u2026\u201dThe blue veins bulged on Bai Xiangwan\u2019s forehead and his eyes were bloodshot. He grabbed Shen Dai\u2019s wrist. All the frantic, violent, and animalistic desires were roaring and rolling in his body. It was itching. His reason and instinct are at war between heaven and man.Shen Dai was also tormented. His wrists kept shaking. He wanted to push Bai Xiangwan away, but also wanted to get closer. Without those two inhibitors, he must have gone crazy already. But his remaining consciousness was competing with his primal desire for the mastery of the body.Bai Xiangwan suddenly turned Shen Dai over and Shen Dai exclaimed, \u201cNo!\u201dXiao Die was stunned at the door. She didn\u2019t know what to do at this time or what this matter would eventually lead to.Bai Xiangwan let out a low growl and slapped his temple twice with his fist, exchanging pain for sobriety. He pressed Shen Dai\u2019s shoulder and tore off the thin pheromone\u2019s sticker.Bai Xiangwan was stunned when he saw the flesh-colored scars on Shen Dai\u2019s glands made of tooth marks and surgical incisions.Shen Dai broke down and cried: \u201cSenior brother, don\u2019t\u2026 help me\u2026\u201dBai Xiangwan looked at Shen Dai at this time. His heart is tingling. He placed his big hand lightly on Shen Dai\u2019s head. After rubbing it, he said in a hoarse voice, \u201cAh Dai, don\u2019t be afraid. I will help you.\u201dShen Dai couldn\u2019t stop crying while begging for help and for mercy.Bai Xiangwan fixed the back of Shen Dai\u2019s head and took off his mask. He leaned down and bit down on Shen Dai\u2019s glands with his canine teeth.A permanent marker is different from a temporary marker. A permanent marker requires canine teeth to penetrate the flesh and inject pheromones into the omega\u2019s glands. At the same time, the alpha\u2019s genitals must form a knot and shoot in the omega\u2019s genital cavity to be considered a complete marker. During the temporary marking, the canine teeth only need to bite the epidermis and at the same time release a comfort pheromone to the omega. This way is done to simulate the permanent marking, giving the omega psychological comfort, which can greatly relieve the omega\u2019s fear, anxiety and pain.Shen Dai screamed. The pain in the back of the neck made countless messy memories flood into his mind. Those happy and painful, hopeful and desperate, love and hate\u2026 all washed his consciousness and his tears flowed even more fiercely.Xiao Die was immediately glad that her teacher didn\u2019t lose his mind, but the sudden knock on the door made her heart almost stop.A low, hostile voice came from outside the door: \u201cOpen the door!\u201d\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.08.09\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: QMY is here! Hahaha! I\u2019d have to say although being \u2018marked\u2019 is traumatising to SD, but I\u2019m glad that BXW gave him a temporary \u2018marker\u2019 because this is exactly a slap to QMY\u2019s face. I\u2019m so happy for QMY to at least know what it\u2019s like to lose SD to another man. But if BXW can marry and give SD a permanent \u2018marker\u2019, that\u2019s even better. But then again, this story is definitely not going into that direction. Hmm. -KPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Nonetheless, the anger in the emotions was easy to distinguish and people could immediately sense danger. She didn\u2019t plan to open the door, but she walked gently to the door, looking out through the peephole.The concave and convex arc mirror distorted the shape of the person outside the door. But the sullen look on the person\u2019s face was only related to himself. She is \u2018confronted\u2019 with the big boss of the company from across a door.Qu Moyu had already noticed that there was someone in the door. There was no smell of pheromones so it would most probably be a beta. He stared coldly at the peephole and ordered again: \u201cOpen the door.\u201dXiao Die looked around in a panic. She couldn\u2019t see the guest bedroom from this position and she couldn\u2019t seek advice from the person who can call the shots in this room \u2013 Bai Xiangwan. The entanglement between Qu Moyu and Shen Dai was a combination of a lot of gossip and her own imagination. Bai Xiangwan didn\u2019t let her ask Shen Dai, so she never asked. But in any case, the child was born and the relationship must be unusual.So, this door must not be opened. Alpha is such a competitive creature. And not to mention, Qu Moyu is their boss. Once he gets inside the house, whether it is scolding or even fighting, the consequences are unimaginable. But that is an S-class alpha outside the door. This kind of ordinary civilian-level security door can\u2019t withstand the destructive power of an S-class alpha\u2026 Qu Moyu\u2019s patience is being consumed at a speed invisible to the naked eye. He clenched his fists, restrained his anger, and said coldly, \u201cPlease open the door. I\u2019m here to pick up Shen Dai.\u201dHe paused. And the meaning was a straightforward threat, \u201cThis is the final. The final one of my first requests. Don\u2019t make me repeat the second time.\u201dXiao Die was about to cry. At this time, Bai Xiangwan came out. His face was pale and his eyes were bloodshot. His hair was a little messy. His deep pupils stared at the door without blinking and he said softly, \u201cOpen the door.\u201d\u201cTeacher\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You should be optimistic. Think of Qiuqiu.\u201dXiao Die gritted her teeth and opened the door. She was small. So, she could only raise her head to look at Qu Moyu, who was as tall as a wall. She subconsciously shrank herself into a small shadow: \u201cQu\u2026 President Qu.\u201dQu Moyu passed her and strode into the room. The fragrance immediately attacked his senses. He was stunned, not expecting that he would encounter a worse situation than Bai Xiangwan standing in front of him.Shen Dai is in heat?!When Shen Dai said that he was going to take Qiuqiu home to celebrate his grandmother\u2019s birthday, he knew that Shen Dai was lying. When he arranged for Assistant Cheng to transfer her to another hospital, he had glanced at the old woman\u2019s details and even though he didn\u2019t look carefully, his memory is very good. The birthday of the old woman is clearly in the second half of the year. He didn\u2019t break it to Shen Dai. Instead, he allowed Shen Dai to go back to relax. But when he knew that Shen Dai didn\u2019t go home, but instead took Qiuqiu to Cheng Zimei\u2019s house, he didn\u2019t break it to him either. But he had felt something that made him feel uncomfortable. He had guessed that something was wrong.Sure enough, last night, the person he sent to watch Shen Dai told him that Bai Xiangwan took a student to Cheng Zimei\u2019s house. On the premise of his explicit warning, Shen Dai still brought Qiuqiu to see Bai Xiangwan privately and even lied to him about it. He was already furious at the time, but he held back. Like a resentful jealous woman, he came to the door to catch them in the act.But just now, he learned that Bai Xiangwan was here again. Alone.All kinds of unbearable guesses in his mind repeatedly tore his emotions. He left an important dinner meeting and rushed over. He used all his self-control to curb the surging pheromones and warned himself that no matter what he saw, he should try his best to stay sane.However, after stepping into the house, an unexpected situation occurred. Shen Dai was in his estrus period. Shen Dai took Qiuqiu to hide here in order to avoid him when he was in heat?!Shen Dai was in heat and Bai Xiangwan was present. This sentence echoed in his mind repeatedly, piercing his brain like an electric drill. Fortunately, his ability to think was not lost. The time interval between him and Bai Xiangwan reaching the building was only a few minutes apart. Bai Xiangwan was fully dressed and conscious. There was another person in the house, apparently nothing that he could not bear had happened.The room full of epiphyllum pheromones made the blood of the two alphas swell and they stared at each other. The ground beneath the two of them seemed to be covered with gasoline. They just need a little spark and they will\u2026 Xiao Die is a beta but she already felt bad. The sensitive Qiuqiu cried in fear, but the attention of the two alphas was all in this bloodless \u2018fight\u2019. They focused on tracking every movement of the enemy, completely ignoring the outside voices.Qu Moyu\u2019s social status forced his reason. He swallowed the words \u2018go away\u2019: \u201cProfessor Bai, get out of here.\u201dThe words are not offensive, but the tone is an absolute command and threat. Bai Xiangwan could feel that Qu Moyu\u2019s pheromones were about to explode and pointed at him aggressively. He knew what he was facing. An enraged beast that would pose a major danger to his personal safety. It was an aggression against him. He was the leader of the industry giants that have a major impact on their careers and futures.But if he really retreated like this, regardless of Shen Dai\u2019s life or death, it was not in line with his principle of being a human being. He said solemnly, \u201cMr. Qu, I think we should all leave.\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s eyes became more and more gloomy: \u201cDo you know what you are talking about?\u201d\u201cShen Dai is here because he doesn\u2019t want you to be close to him during his estrus period. Please respect his wishes.\u201d\u201cThen why are you here?!\u201d Qu Moyu growled.\u201cI was afraid that something would happen to him, so\u2026\u201dWith Shen Dai hanging on Qu Moyu\u2019s heartstrings, he didn\u2019t want to talk nonsense with Bai Xiangwan for half a second. He strode to the guest bedroom.Bai Xiangwan stepped forward, trying to stop Qu Moyu. Qu Moyu glared at Bai Xiangwan fiercely, the powerful alpha pheromone formed a huge pressure, forcing Bai Xiangwan to stumble back three steps. His heart seemed like it had stopped beating at that moment. The blood on his face faded cleanly and the power that came out of nowhere could be retracted and released in an instant. But Bai Xiangwan hadn\u2019t recovered from the stature just now. He was trembling.Qu Moyu had narrowed the range of pheromone oppression to only close contact, but the energy was too strong. Qiuqiu was still affected a little and the crying turned into a hoarse scream.Qu Moyu\u2019s face was extremely ugly. His eyes fell on Xiao Die and he said dumbly, \u201cTake the child out.\u201dXiao Die, who was shrunk in the corner, hurried over when she heard the words. She pushed Qiuqiu\u2019s baby carriage and quickly went out.Qu Moyu followed the smells of the ephemeral fragrance and opened the door of the guest bedroom. Shen Dai was half-naked, lying softly on the bed. His thin back was like a snow-white picture, with clear bones depicting the charming valleys and mountains. The potential of them arouses infinite reverie for Qu Moyu. The blood of Qu Moyu is rushing as he is filled with the violent fragrance of the flowers. The pheromones are violently scurrying in his body.On the other hand, Shen Dai\u2019s breath is still stable. It seems that the anxiety when he was in heat has been soothed and there is still a faint smell of another pheromone in the air\u2026Qu Moyu suddenly had a bad premonition. He took a few steps forward nervously and found that there was a little wet blood on the back of Shen Dai\u2019s neck with a faint smell of white elm pheromone emanating from his body.The will that was stretched to the limit exploded at this moment and Qu Moyu realised what the pain of his heart being gouged out felt like. He seemed to be the one suppressed by the pheromone, unable to think, move, or breathe. Someone took a sharp knife and cut his heart open, smeared his chest and smeared his world beyond recognition with dripping blood.He was in crazy pain.There were light footsteps behind him and Qu Moyu turned around like a beast with lightning speed. In the blink of an eye, he grabbed Bai Xiangwan\u2019s collar with both hands and twisted the opponent\u2019s neck in the opposite direction.Bai Xiangwan grabbed Qu Moyu\u2019s wrist violently and his pale face suddenly turned red.\u201cYou dare to \u2018mark\u2019 him.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s face was grim and he kept baring his fangs, \u201cYou dare to \u2018mark\u2019 my omega!\u201dBai Xiangwan said hoarsely, \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 a temporary\u2026 \u2018mark\u2019.\u201dOf course Qu Moyu knew it was a temporary \u2018mark\u2019, but he couldn\u2019t allow it: \u201cHe is my omega! He is mine!\u201dThis was the moment in his life when he wanted to release pheromones wantonly. He wanted to bite off the intruder\u2019s neck. If Shen Dai was not there, after being overwhelmed by jealousy, there would be no pheromones that could even restrain him.\u201cReally?\u201d Bai Xiangwan showed a mocking smile. His eyes were fierce and angry, \u201cIs he\u2026 your\u2026 omega? Your \u2018mark\u2019\u2026 on him\u2026 is\u2026\u201dQu Moyu kept tightening his hands. Even after seeing Bai Xiangwan\u2019s eyes bloodshot from being strangled, he didn\u2019t stop. In fact, he is savouring the pleasure of this twisted revenge.\u201cYou\u2026 \u2018marked\u2019 him, and forced him\u2026 to wash it off\u2026\u201d Qu Moyu froze suddenly. Bai Xiangwan seized the moment\u2019s laxity and suddenly released his own pheromones. He pushed Qu Moyu into the corridor ruthlessly to the opposite wall.Bai Xiangwan leaned against the wall and coughed violently.The fight between the two woke Shen Dai from his semi-consciousness. He opened his heavy eyelids and looked outside the open door. Two alphas were standing against the wall in the narrow corridor. Two alphas flowing in the air with their pheromones full of tyranny.His confused brain was temporarily unable to process and analyse the scene in front of him and he only felt scared.Qu Moyu\u2019s aura was like a flame filled with sand but was suddenly weakened for a bit. Without waiting for him to speak, Bai Xiangwan said sternly: \u201cI temporarily \u2018marked\u2019 him to make him less painful. But how about you? You \u2018marked\u2019 him in spite of your lust and when you sobered up, you regretted it. You forced him to wash off the \u2018mark\u2019. I guess you also forced him to destroy Qiuqiu? Otherwise, why would he hide from you and run off to Lancheng?!\u201dQu Moyu opened his mouth. His lips were trembling. But he was speechless.\u201cWhere were you when he was pregnant and gave birth to a child when his life was the most difficult? Where were you when he threw up what he ate and lost eight pounds in a month? And when he stood in line at the hospital alone for three or four hours during his maternity check? And when his feet were swollen to the point of walking hurts? After giving birth, Qiuqiu was in the hospital for half a month and only the nurses took care of him. Every day and night, he took care of the child upside down and couldn\u2019t get a full night\u2019s sleep. Where the hell were you at those times?!\u201d Bai Xiangwan has always been a calm person. But at this time, he just wanted to vent his contempt for the person in front of him, \u201cNow that you have appeared, you are still brazenly trying to rob his child and you dare to say that he is your omega when he has already washed off your \u2018mark\u2019. He is not your omega!\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d Qu Moyu shouted violently. In anger, he pulled Bai Xiangwan\u2019s collar again.Shen Dai shouted weakly, but neither of the two in anger heard him.Qu Moyu threw Bai Xiangwan out of the front door half-dragging him and slammed it shut hard.\u201cQu Moyu!\u201d Bai Xiangwan patted the door, \u201cWhat are you doing? Don\u2019t hurt him again!\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t hurt him!\u201d Qu Moyu let out a desperate cry. His voice was getting weaker and weaker, \u201cI\u2026 he is my omega. I won\u2019t hurt him\u2026\u201d\u201cOpen the door! Qu Moyu!\u201dQu Moyu returned to the guest bedroom and closed the door. He looked at Shen Dai and the brief silence was like a dense cloud before a heavy rain. The dim light covered Shen Dai\u2019s clean texture with a moist, soft light. His moist eyes looked at Qu Moyu hazily. His nose widened as he smelled his surroundings. His lips slightly opened and closed as he said weakly, \u201cWhat happened to Brother Bai?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention him.\u201d Qu Moyu pressed one knee on the mattress. He tore off his tie and shirt and looked down at the beautiful scenery in front of him. His desires were rising and fermenting. But Bai Xiangwan\u2019s words were still echoing in his ears. The tingling of his heart tormented him for a moment. His omega is suffering and all the faults point out to him.Under the double appeasement of the inhibitor and the temporary \u2018marker\u2019, Shen Dai\u2019s estrus has subsided a lot under the premise that if he no longer receives any stimulation. But Qu Moyu is a new stimulation. How could he resist such a powerful alpha pheromone at this time?Realising what Qu Moyu was going to do, Shen Dai shivered and shrank back: \u201cNo. Qu Moyu\u2026 No\u2026\u201dQu Moyu leaned down, pinched Shen Dai\u2019s chin and kissed him. The kiss was intense and lingering, wishing he could take away all of Shen Dai\u2019s rejections. At the same time, he neatly tore off the excessive fabric on Shen Dai\u2019s body.\u201cNo\u2026 Qu Moyu\u2026\u201d\u201cShh\u2026\u201d Qu Moyu softly comforted Shen Dai while kissing him. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, Ah Dai. Don\u2019t be afraid. You are my omega. I will accompany you through the estrus period and I will take care of you at any time in the future. I\u2019ll be with you through it all.\u201dHis senses are so keen. His breath is full of the fragrance of the ephemeral flowers tainted by the scent of white elm. Jealousy corrodes every nerve of him and his heart is broken. He was in pain and despair. His heart was crushed and he had to ride the wind to fly to the karma named Shen Dai.There was no other way. He didn\u2019t believe that feelings could torture people to this point. Until Shen Dai appeared in his life, he didn\u2019t know how to measure love, or even how to love. He only knew that he must never lose Shen Dai.The only way to save this is to take back his omega. He wants to \u2018mark\u2019 Shen Dai. The real, permanent \u2018mark\u2019. An unswerving one on his Shen Dai.Qu Moyu lay on his side beside Shen Dai and he took the man into his arms. He held Shen Dai\u2019s erect genitals with one hand and stroked it. His other hand went directly to his buttocks. The asshole kept opening and closing, secreting smooth intestinal juice, dripping with \u2018invitation\u2019.\u201cQu Moyu! Go away and don\u2019t touch me!\u201dShen Dai was stripped to the bare bones and his sweaty body was smooth and moist. The more he struggled in Qu Moyu\u2019s arms, the more tempting he became. But he didn\u2019t realise this. He just wanted to escape! Qu Moyu inserted his fingers into the wet and soft flesh hole, dug out a large piece of intestinal juice and smeared all of it on Shen Dai\u2019s face. He then kissed Shen Dai\u2019s ear and cheek and said in a rough voice, \u201cYou want me to go away? You know how much you want me to fuck you. Your body is much more honest.\u201dShen Dai said hoarsely: \u201cNo. Don\u2019t\u2026\u201dQu Moyu put his long arm through one of Shen Dai\u2019s legs, raised it high, and poked the fleshy hole with his thick and painfully long meat blade, looking for the correct entrance.Shen Dai was trembling all over. The reason he had just gained and the rekindled desire were fighting endlessly again. Every cell in his body was eager to be penetrated, inserted, and viciously violated. And he wanted the brutal and strong alpha to enter his body. To enter his secret place \u2013 whether it\u2019s genitals or the pheromones. He wants to keep having sex. He wants to hug Qu Moyu and never let him go.But he can\u2019t. He can\u2019t! He can no longer have more entanglements with Qu Moyu!Shen Dai firmly grasped the trace of his lucid sanity and struggled weakly: \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t want\u2026Aah-\u201cAccompanied by Shen Dai\u2019s scream, Qu Moyu inserted his genitals in. The warm and moist flesh had already been prepared for this long-awaited fusion. Qu Moyu also endured to the limit. He stabbed deeply to the end, straight to the heart of the acupuncture point and hit the soft genital cavity.Pain, soreness, numbness, excitement\u2026 all the pleasure rushed into the brain in an instant. All the limbs and bones trembled as if they were overwhelmed.Qu Moyu was also very relieved by the tightly wrapped meat wall. He took a deep breath. How could a hungry person taste delicious food gracefully? He let Shen Dai\u2019s lower body open for himself and then started to slam wildly.The excessively violent movements made the bed under both of them shake and Qu Moyu thought that the position of lying on his side was not deep enough and not strong enough. So he took out his wet dick, turned him over to face him and pressed himself on Shen Dai thinly. He then grabbed Shen Dai\u2019s fair and slender legs and hooked them on his shoulders, raised his waist with a pillow underneath it, and pushed his dick in again from the front. Shen Dai grabbed the crumpled sheets with both hands and was \u2018nailed\u2019 in place by Qu Moyu\u2019s genitals with nowhere to hide, enduring waves of ferocious manipulations.The surging desire infects his every nerve. He makes an uncontrollable lewd scream as he struggles between the pain and pleasure. He shakes his head and tails but he still sinks infinitely.The bodies of alpha and omega are blending in water and milk. The pheromones are also entangled invisibly. The smell in the whole house is so strong that it is about to turn into tangible things, tightly wrapping the two who wanted to rise and fall.Qu Moyu swayed his powerful waist frantically. He went in and out of the ecstasy hole again and again. It forced him to keep exploring, looting, and filling in all the gaps that he could reach.Whenever he collided with Shen Dai\u2019s genital cavity, it was exchanged for Shen Dai\u2019s terrified and emotional screams, as well as the contraction of the limit of the flesh hole. The pleasure brought at that moment was like a tsunami rising from the ground. It was so refreshing that his soul felt like it was going to come out of his body. He thrusted forward fiercely, wishing he could put all of his testicles in as well. Shen Dai\u2019s head almost touched the soft end on the head of the bed but he was dragged back by his waist to endure a new round of fucking.He possessed Shen Dai completely. He licked and bit Shen Dai\u2019s lips, sucked Shen Dai\u2019s skin, stroked and rubbed every inch of Shen Dai\u2019s body. He wished he could swallow this omega into his stomach and slowly taste all the goodness he could give him.The slaps and sounds of water from the gouge in the back hole were lewd and rambunctious. The intestinal juices were even pounded into tiny foams, staining Shen Dai\u2019s thighs wet.Shen Dai was fucked to the point of becoming paralyzed and he seemed to have no autonomy from the waist down. He became a container for pure adultery and pleasure. Crazy stimulation continued to hit his body. There were flames and orgasms everywhere. Pleasure eroded his sanity and he begged for mercy in disorder. But then he screamed again and again.This crusade seemed to be endless. Shen Dai was unconscious for a time and was reawakened by the extreme stimulation to this lustful field where dreams and reality alternated. Qu Moyu flipped Shen Dai\u2019s body over, making him kneel on the bed. His eyes first fell on Shen Dai\u2019s red, swollen, spit-out, unclosed flesh pussy, and his sacrificial buttocks. The open reproductive channel is an absolute surrender to the alpha. His eyes moved up and were fixed on the back of Shen Dai\u2019s neck, where there were interlaced scars and mottled bloodstains, which was also something that he must deal with.He slowly pushed the bloody, terrifyingly thick big dick back into Shen Dai\u2019s flesh hole and fucked it for more than a hundred times. The entrance of the genital cavity began to push inward. At the same time, he leaned down, revealing sharp canine teeth, aiming at Shen Dai\u2019s glands.A sharp pain hit. Shen Dai\u2019s eyes widened suddenly. He felt as if his lower body was about to be pierced. He was no stranger to this kind of tearing pain. He knew that Qu Moyu wanted to form a knot in his genital cavity! All the painful memories flooded back into his mind. The pain Shen Dai felt was not only in the genital cavity, but also in the glands, in the heart, in the nerves, and among the painful memories of a series of consequences in his life. Such as being married to their sexual relationships, being \u2018marked\u2019, and getting pregnant. They were all completely triggered and even awakened him in the chaos of him being in heat.Shen Dai gathered all his strength and struggled: \u201cDon\u2019t! Let me go!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Ah Dai, let me \u2018mark\u2019 you.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s canines hovered above the back of Shen Dai\u2019s neck. He said solemnly and affectionately as if he was about to deliver all his life, \u201cI will give you my \u2018mark\u2019. You will become the only omega in my life.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t\u2014\u201d Shen Dai screamed in horror. He turned his head and looked at Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes full of fear and determination. He said with tears in his eyes as he gritted his teeth, \u201cIf you dare to \u2018mark\u2019 me again, I will remove my glands!\u201d\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.08.10\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: QMY much needed this lesson:Bai Xiangwan: Now that you have appeared, you are still brazenly trying to rob his child and you dare to say that he is your omega when he has already washed off your \u2018mark\u2019.

He heard it right. Shen Dai didn\u2019t want his \u2018mark\u2019 and even threatened to remove his glands.Shen Dai didn\u2019t want his \u2018mark\u2019.The \u2018mark\u2019 of an S-class alpha symbolises the highest commitment he can give, which means that he will hand over the control of himself and the only reproduction right to the other party. This decision was made in a sober state. He knows how much pressure and predicament he will face and he knows what a huge risk he is taking. But he still decides to give it to the person he loves. It is the most precious thing in his life. But the other party doesn\u2019t want it and doesn\u2019t even appreciate it.Qu Moyu instantly softened. He fell down on the bed and stared blankly at Shen Dai, who was holding the back of his neck and shrank into a ball. Everyone else was fighting to obtain an S-class alpha\u2019s \u2018mark\u2019. But he was rejected to this extent?Up to now, he never seemed to believe in what Shen Dai had said \u2013 \u201cI want nothing from you and I don\u2019t want you\u201c. He has always been conceited that Shen Dai is only resentful towards him. That he was just dissatisfied with the situation between himself and Qiuqiu. As long as he treats them well and gives them a proper status, Shen Dai\u2019s attitude towards him will get better sooner or later. After all, Shen Dai once liked him so much. After all, he can give Shen Dai a life far beyond his imagination.It turned out that Shen Dai really didn\u2019t want him anymore. His omega would rather hide in his estrus period. He preferred to have other alpha\u2019s pheromones on his body. And he refused to be \u2018marked\u2019 by him.That\u2019s not his omega. Shen Dai refuses to be his omega.He thought that all this would trigger his thunderous rage, but he had no strength at all. His brain was chaotic and blank. At this time, the only thing that could make him realise his own pain was his broken heart.Why did this happen? How could he and Shen Dai become like this? What had he done to screw everything up?Emotions can be turned into words and pronounced from the throat. But in the end, not a single word could be uttered. He mobilised all of his willpower to suppress the surging pheromones in his body. He needed to enclose himself in an invisible cage. He had to do this. As long as there was a little mistake, it could cause unimaginable consequences.Qu Moyu got out of bed and put on his clothes in silence. He picked up his mobile phone and sent a message to the driver who was on call, asking the driver to park the car at the door of the unit building. He then sent the address to Uncle Heng and asked him to bring Aunt Lan over. One reason is to take care of the aftermath and the other is to bring Qiuqiu home. After he put down the phone, he put on Shen Dai\u2019s clothes.Shen Dai had already exhausted his physical strength and only shook violently when Qu Moyu touched him. Then, he stopped moving.Qu Moyu wrapped Shen Dai in a blanket, hugged him in his arms, and went out the door.Bai Xiangwan had already left and he didn\u2019t meet anyone when he went downstairs. Qu Moyu quickly put Shen Dai in the car and asked the driver to take Shen Dai to a private hospital.Seeing that Qu Moyu had no intention of getting in the car, the driver asked, \u201cMaster, where are you going?\u201dQu Moyu only said \u201cTake care of him\u201d. He then closed the door and got into a taxi.***Qu Moyu went to a private club owned by a friend. It was a very special club that only received alphas or S-class alphas.The manager knew him, but didn\u2019t recognize him for a second. It was probably because he had never seen him look so depressed.\u201cMr. Qu, you\u2019re here. Why didn\u2019t you ask the driver to tell me you\u2019ll be here? I can get\u2026\u201d\u201cLock me in.\u201d Qu Moyu said with a hoarse voice.The manager\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He knew that Qu Moyu\u2019s mood was on the verge of collapse. He didn\u2019t want to suffer any unwarranted disaster, so he omitted the courtesy and hurriedly said, \u201cThis way, please.\u201dQu Moyu followed the manager through the dim, endless corridor. The manager pushed open a narrow but surprisingly thick metal door. Qu Moyu walked into the dark room without hesitation.When the door was closed and locked, Qu Moyu stood in the dark for a moment. It was only then that suddenly, the roar of the angry beast broke out.***The passage of time can no longer be accurately perceived by him and the darkness seems to devour everything\u2026 including time.The heavy metal door was opened and a tall figure stood at the door. Most of the dim light was blocked.The man said with a hint of ridicule: \u201cLights on.\u201dThe room suddenly lit up. Qu Moyu tilted his head, closed his eyes tightly and slowly adapted to the light with the tingling pain.The \u2018room\u2019 he is in is actually a square metal box. It can only be described as such because there is nothing in it except a built-in flexible light strip, a switch, and an emergency button.The thick metal walls painted with dark blue colour are covered with bowl-shaped pits of different sizes. It was as if they were punched out by a giant. It is unimaginable what kind of force that had caused such damage.The man looked at Qu Moyu, who was huddled in the corner with tattered clothes. He \u2018tch tch\u2019 twice before saying: \u201cI will not charge you less. This decompression chamber had just arrived yesterday. It is made of a newly developed alloy, which is flexible. The hardness is better, but it\u2019s fucking expensive.\u201dQu Moyu slowly turned his face.The visitor was wearing an ordinary black T-shirt and jeans. He was tall and sturdy. The casual clothes that didn\u2019t really pay attention to its tailoring could not hide the undulating muscle lines underneath the clothes. His legs and arms were sturdy like a leopard ready for strike. He has short stubble and wheat-colored skin. His eyes are full of falcon-like sharpness, surrounded by a dangerous aura. This man has an extremely handsome appearance that makes people dared not look at him directly.He came from a military family. He is the special force king, an S-class alpha, named Yu Fengcheng.Only people with this background can obtain commercial licences for special alloys.Yu Fengcheng looked at Qu Moyu. The dejected and embarrassed face made him stunned for a moment. He realised that Qu Moyu\u2019s condition was worse than he imagined. So he put away his joking attitude and asked tentatively, \u201cWhy are you like this?\u201dThe decompression chamber, as the name suggests, is a place to release pressure on alphas which are subjected to legal and moral constraints. Alphas cannot use pheromones to harm others under normal circumstances. Most especially for S-class alphas with biological weapon-level pheromones. When the emotions have accumulated to a certain level, a way must be found to vent them. So the decompression chamber was built in the city.Usually alphas come here with anger issues. But Qu Moyu came with\u2026 sadness. It is really abnormal.Qu Moyu leaned against the wall and stared blankly ahead. He murmured, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want my \u2018mark\u2019.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Yu Fengcheng didn\u2019t hear it clearly. Or maybe he heard it, but he wasn\u2019t quite sure if he heard it correctly.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want my \u2018mark\u2019.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s lips trembled slightly. \u201cHe told me that if I dare to \u2018mark\u2019 him again, he will remove his glands.\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s words hovered in his mind like a spell. It forced him to go crazy. As he spoke, tears streamed down his cheeks quietly. He raised his hand to cover his eyes and his tears seeped out between his fingers. He is crying\u2026 He actually cried. Even he himself was surprised that he could cry. He had almost forgotten what crying felt like.The heart hurts too much and the tears are like a cruel expression of a poet.Yu Fengcheng was silent.They are both S-class alphas. The value of \u2018marking\u2019 in their minds is very high. In which, it can be compared with life, self-esteem, and property. He does not know who Qu Moyu is talking about. But if that person can make the crown prince of Xingzhou, who has always put interests first, willingly want to give the \u2018mark\u2019, he must be someone who is extremely cherished by Qu Moyu. Under such circumstances, being rejected so harshly meant that his sincerity and dignity have been crushed and trampled under his feet.If it was him, he couldn\u2019t stand it either.Yu Fengcheng regretted coming to watch this \u2018show\u2019. He is not good at solving problems for others, especially for such a blow. He hesitated for a moment and then asked, \u201cWhy is it \u2018again\u2019?\u201dQu Moyu opened his mouth and said in a hoarse voice, \u201cI \u2018marked\u2019 him during the susceptible period and I forced him to wash it off.\u201d Recalling one of the things he did, it was a stupid thing. He gritted his teeth with hatred. Why would he treat his omega and child like that? If only\u2026 If only he had realised his feelings for Shen Dai earlier\u2026 But it\u2019s such a pity that there is no such thing in the world. The sins he had made must now be completely repaid.Yu Fengcheng frowned: \u201cI heard that the Zhou family wants to break the engagement off with you because someone else gave birth to an alpha baby for you. Is that him?\u201dQu Moyu didn\u2019t answer, tacitly confirming the fact.Yu Fengcheng leaned against the wall and felt a headache: \u201cI\u2019ll take you to the lounge first. You need to replenish your energy now before you can go out and solve the problem yourself.\u201d\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.08.11\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: Yeah. That\u2019s Yu Fengcheng from \u2018My Little Poplar\u2019. I dunno why Shui Qian Cheng put forward some of the MLs from her other stories in this story but well, I should just let you guys know (those who are not aware of it) that the other novels are not ABO. I don\u2019t really understand the logic but I don\u2019t mind. It doesn\u2019t have to make sense and I\u2019m not gonna criticise the author for it lol -KP/S: In the previous chapter, I\u2019ve read some comments that talked about QMY\u2019s previous action as r*pe and yes I agree on that. I think this story is tagged with r*pe in NovelUpdates. I should\u2019ve put the warning on top of the chapter beforehand. So, that was my mistake. I\u2019ll put it in. I apologize for any unintentional triggering on your part. And no. We don\u2019t condone r*pe. But some people have their own preferences in writing and reading. The act is not glorified in this story. The author wrote about it to incite our disgust and hate towards ML, I supposed. And our ML is also a human being who made mistakes which he will later try to redeem himself. I\u2019m not siding on the ML but this is just the author\u2019s style in writing and I like her style of writing so I\u2019m a little sad when she is criticised but criticism is also necessary so it\u2019s okay. If you think this story is not your cup of tea, it\u2019s fine. I hope you will find a better story to heal you. Thank you. -KPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His fever had subsided. But his body was still uncomfortable. He was now completely sober.He remembered everything that happened before he was unconscious. All the chaos, despair and unbearableness\u2026 All the confusion that Qu Moyu brought him, leaving him nowhere to hide.The white elm pheromone on his body was very elegant. He could smell it very clearly. He didn\u2019t know why Bai Xiangwan was there, let alone why Qu Moyu was also there. The three of them seemed to be tied to an out-of-control car. In the car, the hurricane rushed towards the cliff and thus, who can stop the destruction from coming?Shen Dai raised his hand subconsciously and touched the back of his neck. There was only a small scab on the wound on the skin. He knew that Qu Moyu didn\u2019t mark him in the end, but he still had lingering fears if he did.Perhaps many people in the world think that the \u2018mark\u2019 of an S-class alpha is an invitation to Vanity Fair. But for him, it was a poisoned apple for which he had paid the painful price of derailing his life into. He will never repeat the same mistakes again.When he said he was going to remove the glands, he meant it. If he didn\u2019t have the glands, if he wasn\u2019t an omega, wouldn\u2019t he be able to reduce a lot of his suffering? At least, he will no longer experience the period of being slaughtered by others and he will no longer be controlled by Qu Moyu\u2019s pheromones. Even at the cost of his own health, if he can break free from this innate shackle, what\u2019s the problem? It will be worth it.He thought to himself that when Qiuqiu got to three years old, he would stop relying too much on his pheromones\u2026 By that time,\u2026 he will\u2026Wait! Qiuqiu!He looked around and couldn\u2019t find his mobile phone. He pulled on the call bell.Soon, the nurse pushed the door and came in. She was followed by Aunt Lan.\u201cAh Dai, you\u2019re awake.\u201d Aunt Lan\u2019s smile was reluctant. It was as if she was worried. This is a pure and kind woman who does not hide her emotions.But Shen Dai didn\u2019t want to ask anything. He didn\u2019t seem to care about anything other than Qiuqiu, including himself. He asked, \u201cAunt Lan, where is Qiuqiu?\u201d He opened his mouth and his voice was hoarse. His throat is sore.Aunt Lan poured a glass of water: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Qiuqiu is at home. The nanny is watching over him.\u201d\u201cMy handphone?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. You didn\u2019t have a mobile phone when you got here.\u201d It must be still at Cheng Zimei\u2019s house, Shen Dai thought. Even if he didn\u2019t have his mobile phone, he doesn\u2019t know how to face them now. The sense of shame is already a low-level torture for him. He was feeling more and more deeply guilty for causing them so much trouble.\u201cDo you want me to ask Xiao Wu?\u201d Aunt Lan asked.\u201cNo need. Can you turn on the nanny cam and let me have a look?\u201dAunt Lan opened the software on her phone. And when Shen Dai saw that Qiuqiu was sleeping, he felt relieved. He then sat up from the hospital bed.\u201cAh Dai, do you want to go to the toilet?\u201d\u201cI want to go home.\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t recovered yet. The doctor asked you to stay for a few more days.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not necessary.\u201d\u201cAh Dai, let\u2019s listen to the doctor.\u201d Aunt Lan said. Her face looked like she was in a difficult position.Shen Dai paused for a while. He then lay back down. How could he not tell that this is definitely not the order from the doctor. It is clearly from Qu Moyu. After all, they are all hired by him. So there is no need to make Aunt Lan embarrassed. He asked, \u201cHow many more days?\u201dAunt Lan said slowly, \u201cAbout\u2026 four or five days.\u201d\u201cUntil my temporary \u2018mark\u2019 disappears completely, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Shen Dai asked in a muffled voice.Aunt Lan only sighed.Also, how could Qu Moyu allow him to go out with another alpha\u2019s pheromones on him? Where would the S-class alpha\u2019s dignity be placed?\u201cUnderstood. But you have to bring Qiuqiu over.\u201d\u201cI will tell the young master.\u201d\u201cAunt Lan, can you lend me your cell phone again? I want to make a few calls.\u201dShen Dai called Shen Qin first and asked about his grandmother. In the past few days, his grandmother\u2019s health has improved and her spirit is also good. But she can\u2019t be discharged from the hospital for the time being. After saying a few words, Shen Qin started to ask what kind of nutrition he wanted for his grandma\u2019s supplement and what medicines he prescribed.Shen Dai was powerless to say anything to him: \u201cI have a problem with my mobile phone. I will transfer the money to you in the afternoon. Please take care of my grandma.\u201dHe called Cheng Zimei next.Cheng Zimei was obviously impatient when she answered the unfamiliar phone call. After hearing Shen Dai\u2019s voice, she said \u2018ah\u2019: \u201cAh Dai? How are you? How are you? Where are you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in the hospital. I\u2019m fine. \u201cShen Dai said in a deep voice, \u201cI\u2019ve caused you trouble again. I\u2019m really sorry. I\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t take it to heart. No one thought that Mr. Qu would\u2026\u201d Cheng Zimei also felt a little embarrassed. \u201cWell, Mr. Qu\u2019s housekeeper has come to take care of the aftermath. That old man is very kind and he has lost a lot of money to me. Is this considered hush money?\u201dShen Dai supported his heavy and sore forehead with his palm: \u201d Is my cell phone in your house?\u201d\u201cThe housekeeper took it away.\u201d Cheng Zimei asked cautiously, \u201cAh Dai, are you going to marry Mr. Qu?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe news that Mr. Qu and Zhou Xiaochu had cancelled their engagement came out today. It has been confirmed. And now, the rumours say that Mr. Qu wants to marry you.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s voice suddenly became cold: \u201cNo. We can\u2019t.\u201dCheng Zimei sighed helplessly: \u201cAh Dai\u2026\u201d She paused and finally, she swallowed what she wanted to say, \u201cAfter the estrus period is when you are weak, you should rest well.\u201d\u201cOkay. Can you tell me Brother Bai\u2019s phone number?\u201dLooking at the message sent by Cheng Zimei, Shen Dai couldn\u2019t muster the courage to call him. So he finally only returned the phone to Aunt Lan: \u201cAunt Lan, my phone is with Uncle Heng. Can Uncle Heng bring it to me?\u201d\u201cOh, okay.\u201dAunt Lan was sending a message when there was a knock on the door of the ward. Madam Qu came in.\u201cMa\u2019am.\u201dMadam Qu nodded to Aunt Lan, her eyes suggesting that she and the nurse should go out first.After the two of them left, Madam Qu sat beside the hospital bed with sad eyes: \u201cAh Dai, are you feeling better?\u201dShen Dai said in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019m much better.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here to pick you up to leave the hospital. Do you remember the house where you met Qiuqiu once? You and Qiuqiu should move there first.\u201d Madam Qu added, \u201cMoyu also agreed.\u201dShen Dai stared blankly at Madam Qu, as if he couldn\u2019t believe it.Madam Qu took out a mobile phone from her bag: \u201cAh Heng gave it to me. This is yours.\u201dShen Dai slowly took the phone and asked hesitantly, \u201cFor real?\u201d\u201cFor real. The two child-rearing nanny will also take care of Qiuqiu.\u201d Madam Qu lowered her head and looked sad, \u201cIt\u2019s not convenient for Moyu to see you now. I have told Ah Heng to pack up and move over the daily necessities for you and Qiuqiu\u2019s.\u201dShen Dai was silent for a long time before asking, \u201cWhat does he want?\u201d He was on guard against any actions of Qu Moyu. Even if Madam Qu came forward now, if Qu Moyu did not agree, he would still not be able to get rid of Qu Moyu.Madam Qu thought for a while: \u201cHe\u2019s in a mess right now. Please give him some time.\u201dWhat came to Madam Qu\u2019s mind was the conversation she had with her son not long ago. She didn\u2019t tell Shen Dai that Qu Moyu was also in this hospital. He is in the next door ward.Last night, Qu Moyu was consuming too much energy in the decompression chamber. Yu Fengcheng judged that his condition was not good and sent him to the hospital.Alphas have the ability to use pheromones to dominate others, but their domination of pheromones also comes at a price. Qu Moyu beat the twelve-centimetre-thick alloy like Swiss cheese, which shows how terrible the pheromones that he had released.This was Qu Moyu\u2019s worst health condition in his life. When Madam Qu arrived at the hospital, he had already been infused with three bottles of liquid.Madam Qu saw that Qu Moyu was wearing a hospital gown with his messy hair. his stubble had just appeared on his pale face. She dared not recognize that this was her son who had always been high-spirited.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Madam Qu was distressed and anxious, \u201cAh Heng said that Shen Dai is here too?\u201dQu Moyu didn\u2019t have the face to tell his mother what happened, although she probably knew everything: \u201cNext door.\u201d He leaned against the wall, imagining that there was Shen Dai on the other side of the wall so this might be the closest distance they could keep for now. He didn\u2019t even have the courage to take a few steps to take a look at him. He was afraid. He was afraid of smelling Bai Xiangwan\u2019s pheromones on Shen Dai.Madam Qu couldn\u2019t help scolding: \u201cHow old are you? Why do you let yourself become like this?\u201dQu Moyu was silent for a while. He then said, \u201cHe won\u2019t let me \u2018mark\u2019 him.\u201d\u201cYou forced him to wash off the \u2018mark\u2019, you know\u2026\u201d Madam Qu gritted her teeth, \u201cOf course, he won\u2019t now.\u201d She couldn\u2019t imagine how much pain it would take to perform an operation without anaesthesia. How can he be willing to be \u2018marked\u2019 again after he had experienced it?\u201cI want to marry him. I want to \u2018mark\u2019 him and give him everything he wants. But he\u2026\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s lips trembled and his heart felt a pain, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want anything from me.\u201dMadam Qu sighed: \u201cMoyu, do you really like him?\u201dQu Moyu laughed at himself: \u201cOtherwise, why would I do this?\u201d\u201cBut what you did to him didn\u2019t show any of it.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m not good enough for him. I broke off the engagement, I took him and Qiuqiu home, and I am even willing to give him my \u2018mark\u2019.\u201d Qu Moyu closed his eyes and said tiredly, \u201cHe still doesn\u2019t want it. What does he want? He doesn\u2019t want anything\u2026 Mom, I have nothing to give him.\u201d Even the \u2018mark\u2019 couldn\u2019t impress Shen Dai. What else could he give?Madam Qu looked at her son. Her eyes were full of deep sadness. She slowly held Qu Moyu\u2019s hand and choked: \u201cIt\u2019s your mother\u2019s fault. I let your father educate you in his way. I was too weak that I couldn\u2019t keep your sister. I couldn\u2019t take care of you. I didn\u2019t even teach you how to love someone.\u201dAfter giving birth to Qu Moyu, she suffered from severe postpartum depression. Qu Moyu needed his mother the most by then. When he was young, she couldn\u2019t take care of him. And when she had gotten better, she didn\u2019t know how to get along with an S-class alpha son who had been instilled in the mentality since he was conscious that he is \u2018superior\u2019. She was once afraid of her own son. In his body, she kept seeing the miniature of her husband.It\u2019s not that she didn\u2019t realise her son\u2019s emotional needs for her but she escaped from him uncontrollably. Time and time again, after she spent years of piecing together her broken self from the ruins of her soul, by that time, her son was no longer willing to get close to her. Even she herself once thought that she could not educate an S-class alpha. But she forgot that it was her own child and that he was just another human being.She held Qu Moyu\u2019s hand tightly: \u201cMoyu, the most precious thing is not your \u2018mark\u2019. But it is your heart.\u201d\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.08.12\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: QMY being educated be like\u2026. -_- Meh\u2026 But still, how you educate your child will reflect later on in his/her adulthood.

They use power to build class barriers. Later generations must embrace the same laws and add bricks to it. Generation after generation, the core interests and authority of the class are consolidated. Only in this way can the entire group have always maintained its dominance.They believe in the power of power above all else. And they often dismiss ethereal feelings. Therefore, Qu Moyu couldn\u2019t understand what his mother\u00a0 had said for a while.But he also realised that the power he was used to was ineffective against Shen Dai. Shen Dai did bring Qiuqiu back to him, but he was resisting him in every possible way. He seemed to control Shen Dai, but in fact he didn\u2019t get anything. He thought he would be the winner, just like his countless games with others in the past. In the game with an omega, there is no reason to lose. But Shen Dai\u2019s cold eyes, silent words and careful attitude have already defeated him.The short-lived but stunningly strong Epiphyllum fragrance that was neglected was unwilling to bloom for him again.He had really reached the point where he could do nothing. So he dared to put down his dignity and admit that he could do nothing and that Shen Dai was the first person in his life that he couldn\u2019t break through.Madam Qu read the mixed emotions from her son\u2019s expression. She didn\u2019t know how to guide Qu Moyu to understand the feelings of normal people. She also thought that he didn\u2019t need it, but who could really avoid it? When it comes to love, Shen Dai\u2019s appearance may be a belated redemption for Qu Moyu. And even for herself, it is an opportunity to correct many things in the past.Qu Moyu pondered for a long time before he said with a hoarse voice: \u201cI already told him that I like him.\u201d\u201cBut what you were doing did not reflect that.\u201d Madam Qu said softly, \u201cIf you don\u2019t know what to do, you can first start by respecting him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t force him, listen to what he is saying, and consider from his point of view. Omega\u2019s surrender to alpha is caused by genes but it does not mean he is willing to surrender,\u201dMadam Qu gently stroked her son\u2019s hair. They haven\u2019t been this close for a long time, \u201cThe more you force him, the more you push him further.\u201dQu Moyu lowered his eyes dejectedly. In the fan-shaped shadows cast by the feather eyelashes, there was a hint of thick ink-like pain.\u201cLet Shen Dai move to my place. It is so that we can still take care of him and Qiuqiu.\u201dQu Moyu was unwilling. He didn\u2019t want to let Shen Dai leave his sphere of influence. He should have paid close attention when Shen Dai lied. The fact that his omega was temporarily \u2018marked\u2019 by other alphas eventually became the demon of his life.But now there is no other way. He can only retreat. He nodded: \u201cOkay. You may arrange it.\u201d\u201cYour dad is angry now. Don\u2019t tell him anything. You have to get well soon.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dAt this moment, there was a knock on the door outside the ward.\u201cCome in.\u201dThey thought it was a nurse who came in to change the dressing. Unexpectedly, three doctors came in at once. They were the vice president and two directors of the hospital. They were all hired by the Qu family from a public hospital with high salaries.Qu Moyu frowned. Are these people so blind? He doesn\u2019t have the physical strength and mood to meet people now.The vice president held a document in his hand. His face was full of spring breeze and it was slightly red with excitement: \u201cCongratulations, Madam. Congratulations to President Qu!\u201dThe mother and son looked at each other. They were both puzzled.The vice president shook the things in his hand: \u201cMr. Qu, the gland fluid of the child you sent us for testing a few days ago has come out. Yes, it\u2019s an S-class. Your son is an S-class alpha!\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s eyes stared blankly at them.Madam Qu was also stunned: \u201cWhat? Who?\u201d She reacted immediately and said in surprise, \u201cIs it Qiuqiu?\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s heart began to beat wildly and he couldn\u2019t believe his ears for a moment. This is such a big unexpected news. He hardly had any expectation that Shen Dai could give birth to an S-class alpha.Madam Qu stood up, took the medical record book in the hands of the vice president, and opened it to read it carefully: \u201cPresident Wang, are you sure?\u201d\u201cMadam, don\u2019t worry. How could we have made a mistake with Mr. Qu\u2019s child? After testing it three times, it was determined to be an S-class.\u201d The birth of an S-class alpha is a great event for any family. Not to mention, for this kind of top rich family. They need to be at the helm and become the only first to convey this good news. The vice president has already seen his bright future.Qu Moyu felt a little dazed: \u201cHowever, my omega\u2019s pheromone level is only B.\u201d\u201cFor omega\u2019s pheromone, fertility accounts for a large proportion. Mr. Shen may just not have strong fertility, but his other gene performance is better than most people.\u201d The vice president said with a smile, \u201cWhat\u2019s more, with half of the genes belonging to you as an S-class alpha, the offspring must be outstanding. Congratulations to Mr. Qu. Congratulations to Madam.\u201dQu Mo Yu stiffened. After a while, he suddenly tore off the needle on the back of his hand and was about to get out of bed.The nurse was startled and hurriedly stopped him: \u201cMr. Qu, where are you going? This bottle hasn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to tell Shen Dai about it.\u201d Qu Moyu looked at his mother with an unparalleled expression on his face. It was pride. That was what that expression seemed to say. It seems to say that Shen Dai is worthy of being his omega and Qiuqiu is worthy of being his son!Madam Qu\u2019s mood was very complicated. She was happy, but also worried.As soon as Qu Moyu got up, he felt a burst of dizziness. He stumbled back to the bed and waited for the discomfort to pass. After a few seconds, he calmed down.\u201cMr. Qu, no matter how happy you are, you have to pay attention to your body.\u201d The vice president said, \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to share the good news with your family after you recover.\u201dQu Moyu lowered his head and thought for a moment. He slowly raised his head, looking at the vice president and his pupils were sharp: \u201cHow many people know about this?\u201dThe vice president noticed the sudden drop in Qu Moyu\u2019s mood and suddenly became at a loss: \u201cUh\u2026 besides us, there are two more people in the department.\u201d\u201cTell them not to tell anyone.\u201d Qu Moyu said solemnly, \u201cPresident Wang, this news cannot leave this hospital. Can I leave this matter to you?\u201dMadam Qu frowned and hesitated.The vice-principal didn\u2019t know why, but he still replied: \u201cOf course. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d The two directors also nodded.\u201cPresident Wang, thank you. I would like to talk to my mother alone now.\u201d The vice president took the director and the nurse out of the ward quickly.Qu Moyu let out a long sigh. He closed his eyes and leaned against the head of the bed, with mixed feelings in his heart. The heir of the S-class alpha that he had always wanted to come to him in such a dramatic way. When he heard the news, he had a moment of ecstasy, but he soon realised that this matter could not be known by his father. And he also can\u2019t let Shen Dai know about it for the time being.His father was furious because of the loss of the Zhou family. If he found out that Qiuqiu was the S-class heir he wanted, he would definitely get Qiuqiu\u2019s legal custody. Shen Dai would definitely not be able to bear it. At the same time, when Shen Dai heard of this news, he would only think that everything Qu Moyu did was for Qiuqiu.This psychological gap up and down made his head swell and hurt again.Madam Qu and him thought of the same thing. She pinched the document in her hand and said helplessly: \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that Qiuqiu is so good, but now is not the time to make it public.\u201d Qu Moyu pressed his fingers against his eyebrows, using physical pain to transfer his emotional pain. He murmured, \u201cI can\u2019t let Ah Dai know\u2026\u201d***Madam Qu used her car to pick up Shen Dai and took him out of the hospital. She then took him to the apartment in the city.Shen Dai held his handphone, thinking about the message Bai Xiangwan had just sent him. He doesn\u2019t know how to reply.Bai Xiangwan wrote this: Ah Dai, with these things that had happened, let\u2019s calm down for a while. Don\u2019t blame Xiao Die. She was too nervous. She called me over because she was afraid of you getting into an accident. I don\u2019t know if what I did helped you or hurt you. The problem between you and Mr. Qu still needs to be solved by yourself. I can\u2019t even give you advice for that. For Qiuqiu\u2019s sake, I wish you the best. And if you and Qiuqiu need us, we will still be there for you.Shen Dai felt extremely uncomfortable. When his consciousness was the most vague, Qu Moyu might have used pheromone suppression on Bai Xiangwan. Whether or not there was confusion in his memory, the conflict between the two was certain. And what was more serious was that he had to think of how this matter would affect Bai Xiangwan and Xiao Die\u2019s career. In any case, he couldn\u2019t let his troubles drag down those who had been genuinely helping him.After sitting stiffly for a long time, Shen Dai turned on the phone and replied, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Please apologise to Xiao Die on my behalf.\u201dHe wanted to wait for the white elm pheromone on him to disappear before he could talk to Qu Moyu about it even if he was afraid of Qu Moyu.Every time he thinks of Qu Moyu, his heart trembles. Obviously Qu Moyu didn\u2019t \u2018mark\u2019 him, but in the spring dream of his estrus period, he awakened too many physical and psychological memories that he desperately suppressed. In order to protect himself, in order not to be torn apart by the pain and despair everywhere, from the moment he lay on the operating table to wash off the \u2018mark\u2019, he had sealed up all the good memories related to Qu Moyu. He would never allow himself to remember them again. Because of Qiuqiu, he seems to be able to endure any suffering, but he can\u2019t look directly at the short-lived happiness that he once had.People become numb in the dark and forget the darkness, but a ray of light will remind them that they are in the dark.If it wasn\u2019t for Qu Moyu wanting to \u2018mark\u2019 him at the end, awakening his stress response, he would definitely sink without a bottom line. At this moment, he may be thankful that the pain of him washing off the \u2018mark\u2019 left a lifelong shadow on him. It thus allows him to be able to retrieve the remaining sanity during the high lust of the estrus period.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.08.15\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: Hell yeah, Qiuqiu is an S-class alpha. -KPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After being held in the arms by Shen Dai, a pair of glass bead-like little eyes stared straight at his father. At a glance, it looked as if he\u2019s afraid his father would disappear. Slowly, there is a mist in his eyes and his tender red mouth is flattened, looking extremely aggrieved.Shen Dai felt distressed and guilty. He kissed him several times on the face and coaxed him softly.Madam Qu touched Qiuqiu\u2019s face from the side: \u201cQiuqiu, good boy. You\u2019re so cute.\u201d The emotions flashing in her eyes were complicated. It could just be a psychological effect. But after knowing that Qiuqiu\u2019s pheromone level is also S-class, she feels that the father and son are more and more alike. The physical condition when eating and sleeping, the distinct likes and dislikes, the fact that he also occasionally showed his cautiousness\u2026 In many ways, Qiuqiu is exactly the same as when Qu Moyu was a child.Now that she sees that Qiuqiu is a little uncomfortable, she feels distressed. How could she have the heart to treat her own son like that? Just thinking about it made her feel miserable.Shen Dai sniffed Qiuqiu\u2019s body scent mixed with oatmeal shower gel and milk. This warm scent could temporarily heal the folds of his life. Shen Dai felt that his body had gained some strength.Madam Qu said: \u201cAh Dai, you should live here first. It is also close to the company. You can come back for lunch break at noon, so Qiuqiu will not miss you so much during the day.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d The arrangement was good for both him and Qiuqiu. Although he did not break away from the influence of the Qu family, at least he didn\u2019t have to live under the same roof with Qu Moyu. Thinking of Qu Moyu, he hesitated for a moment.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he doesn\u2019t have the password to enter this house.\u201d Madam Qu fiddled with the fluff on the top of Qiuqiu\u2019s head, which was soft like the belly of a kitten. She said indifferently, \u201cI may not be able to stop him from thinking about coming, but you are allowed not to open the door for him.\u201dShen Dai didn\u2019t worry too much, because worry is superfluous. Few things can really stop an S-class alpha.When he went to work on Monday, Shen Dai put a double-layered pheromone sticker on the back of his neck and added a medicinal plaster sticker. The smell of white elm, which had been fading day by day, was now completely covered up by the smell of medicine.When he arrived at the institute, he found that the atmosphere was even more different than when he first came back. He sensed the meaning of flattery in the words and deeds of some of his colleagues.The news of Qu Moyu and Zhou Xiaochu\u2019s cancellation of their engagement is not very socially popular. After all, Qu Moyu is an entrepreneur, not an internet celebrity. Although the stock price has a certain impact, the magnitude is not large and falls within the scope of normal adjustment. A lot of attention is on the idea that the Qu family used the Zhou family to facilitate the cooperation with X Bank. Now that the marriage cooperation has ended, this move is somewhat like crossing the river and demolishing the bridge. Will it affect the financing?And within the Xingzhou Group, Shen Dai was naturally the focus of gossip. From two years ago when the two had an affair until the time Shen Dai suddenly returned after taking more than a year of sick leave, he was rumoured to have given birth to a child to Qu Moyu. An alpha son. Then, Qu Moyu also took the initiative to send lunch to show his goodwill and broke the engagement. This series of stories connected together into a wonderful drama. The person who used Shen Dai as a joke before, seeing that Shen Dai was really likely to \u2018enter the East Palace\u2019, couldn\u2019t help but have other thoughts.Shen Dai had already made a lot of preparations, but he was still disturbed by this strange atmosphere so he spent most of his morning hiding in the office.He didn\u2019t go home during the lunch break at noon. Although he missed Qiuqiu very much, he also hoped that Qiuqiu would gradually reduce his dependence on himself. More importantly, he had to visit his grandmother.His grandmother also misses Qiuqiu very much, but she does not allow Shen Dai to bring the child to the hospital. During the meal, she asked him several times how many days it would take before she could be discharged from the hospital. Shen Dai couldn\u2019t bear to tell her the truth, so he comforted her and said that it should be soon.Shen Qin was very kind and considerate today. Not only did he not secretly persuade him to ask Qu Moyu for money as usual, but he also took the initiative to care about Qiuqiu and his work. He also promised that he would take good care of his grandmother so that he would not have to worry.Shen Dai knew Shen Qin too well and this reaction was undoubtedly a magnified version of his colleagues who had a subtle attitude, thinking that he was really going to climb the high branch. Shen Dai didn\u2019t reveal his knowledge of his father\u2019s intention and he only avoided Shen Qin\u2019s temptation without answering. He left after having lunch with his grandmother.Outsiders always speculate on the truth through various phenomena. In fact, they are just dressing up the truth to look like how they wanted to see them. The people who were actually involved in the game, after all the truth, still couldn\u2019t be seen clearly.Shen Dai has been unable to think about the various things that had happened between them. He is like a person who fell into a quagmire. At first, he wanted to climb up, but the more he struggled, the deeper he fell down into a pit. He could only give up his self-help and go up and down with the pull of fate.***A few days passed peacefully like this, during which only Madam Qu came to see the child once, and Qu Moyu didn\u2019t make any move. But the longer this is, the more anxious Shen Dai becomes.One night, Shen Dai was in the bathroom bathing Qiuqiu. Qiuqiu, who was lying in the little frog\u2019s bath tub, was kicking his legs happily and making Shen Dai\u2019s front all wet.The nanny laughed beside them: \u201cIt\u2019s rare for a four-month-old child to be so energetic. Look at that calf, he looks like a small meat pestle. He will be taller and bigger in the future.\u201dShen Dai grabbed Qiuqiu\u2019s leg. He put his ankle to his mouth and took a bite, which made Qiuqiu giggle, and he laughed too. It seemed that he could only relax for a moment when he was facing the child: \u201cOkay, let\u2019s not play anymore. Or you would be too excited to sleep again. Sister Chen, hand me the towel.\u201dShen Dai had just wiped half of Qiuqiu when the doorbell rang suddenly.Sister Chen said casually, \u201cWho is it? Coming so late?\u201d She was about to open the door.Shen Dai suddenly had a premonition. He hurriedly said: \u201cSister Chen.\u201d He chased her with the towel to the living room and handed the towel to Sister Chen, \u201cPlease wipe Qiuqiu for me and bring him to sleep. I\u2019ll go to open the door.\u201d\u201cOh, okay.\u201dShen Dai walked to the door and looked out from the peep hole. Sure enough, it was Qu Moyu. He hesitated for a moment before opening the door.It seemed that Qu Moyu didn\u2019t expect this door to be opened so easily. He was holding a colourful gift box in his hand and stared blankly at Shen Dai, looking a bit funny.There was no emotion on Shen Dai\u2019s face and even his eyes were looking calm. When all the resistance is in vain, silence is the last option for him.Qu Moyu felt a little nervous for some reason. He handed over the things in his hand: \u201cI bought it for Qiuqiu. I read in the book that he is going to practise grasping soon.\u201dShen Dai took it from his hands. It was a set of plush stuff. A toy, turnip-pulling game board that helps three to six-month-olds learn to grasp. It was hard for him to imagine that Qu Moyu, who was wearing a six-figure yuan custom suit, would show up with such cute baby stuff.Qu Moyu was about to enter the house, but as soon as a leather shoe crossed the threshold, he stopped and looked at Shen Dai cautiously: \u201cAh Dai, can I come in?\u201dShen Dai was looking for a chance to chat with Qu Moyu regarding Bai Xiangwan\u2019s matter. At this time, he can only let him in.Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes lit up after receiving Shen Dai\u2019s approval. He didn\u2019t expect that he could enter the house smoothly. When passing by him, he instantly enhanced his pheromone perception ability. He could smell that Shen Dai\u2019s body no longer had that damn scent of the temporary \u2018mark\u2019 and he immediately felt good. In the past few days, he couldn\u2019t help but want to see Shen Dai, but he was afraid that he would not be able to bear the smell of other alpha\u2019s pheromones on Shen Dai\u2019s body. So, he had to endure it.As soon as Qu Moyu entered the room, he glanced around the living room, but he didn\u2019t see Qiuqiu. So he was relieved. It\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t want to see his son, he was just afraid that he had finally built up a little trust in front of that kid before but he didn\u2019t control the release of pheromones that day. He\u2019s afraid that everything will return to the original point or even get worse. He asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Qiuqiu?\u201d\u201cWent to sleep.\u201dQu Moyu wanted to go take a look, but he hesitated again. If he woke that kid up, Shen Dai would blame him: \u201cWell, let him sleep\u2026\u201dShen Dai put the toys on the table and stood not far from Qu Moyu, waiting for him to speak.\u201cAh Dai.\u201d Qu Moyu whispered, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I broke my promise. I couldn\u2019t hold back that day. I was angry\u2026\u201d He was so jealous that he didn\u2019t want to mention the name.Shen Dai whispered: \u201cI also want to talk to you about Professor Bai.\u201dQu Moyu frowned: \u201cWhat to talk about?\u201d\u201cProfessor Bai\u2019s appearance that day was an accident. I asked Xiao Die to take care of Qiuqiu. When she saw my condition, she thought I was very sick. So she called her teacher when she was nervous and Professor Bai just helped me out of kindness.\u201d Shen Dai\u2019s eyes looked at the ground, \u201cThis is my explanation about this matter.\u201dThere was no need for Shen Dai to tell him this. Qu Moyu already could also make a guess. But what happened is not important anymore. The important thing is that Bai Xiangwan temporarily \u2018marked\u2019 Shen Dai. The important thing is that his omega was infected by other alpha\u2019s pheromones. His heart beat a few times with hatred and he was angry. But he restrained himself. He said solemnly, \u201cSo what?\u201d\u201cAfter this incident, he and I won\u2019t have any contact with each other. Professor Bai is a rare talent. I hope you won\u2019t embarrass him in official affairs.\u201dQu Moyu gritted his back teeth: \u201cThis is what you want to tell me? Is that it?\u201d He had a stomach full of things he wanted to tell Shen Dai. But Shen Dai opened his mouth and only mentioned Bai Xiangwan!\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.08.16\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: Hehe. He should be jealous. I\u2019m happy that he\u2019s jealous and hurt. -KPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But I can\u2019t pretend that nothing happened. I want to remind Mr. Qu that all the problems between us are not caused by him. It can\u2019t even be caused by him. But saying that it has nothing to do with him is not right as well. Since he helped me and Qiuqiu when I was in my most difficult moment. If you take out your anger at him both in the public or in the private, it will be unreasonable.\u201dQu Moyu suddenly felt discouraged. What Bai Xiangwan said to him that day had tormented him for several nights. What was he doing when his omega was struggling with his baby and living alone? He got engaged, he was busy with his career, and he was thinking about how to conquer the city in the glittering Vanity Fair. Although he also wanted Shen Dai, he didn\u2019t know what Shen Dai had gone through. Shen Dai was right. Without Bai Xiangwan\u2019s help, his omega and his child would have had a harder life. He really wanted to find someone to express his anger to relieve the constant flooding of the poison called guilt and remorse.He hates Bai Xiangwan. It was not only because Bai Xiangwan gave Shen Dai a temporary mark. But it was also because Bai Xiangwan, at some time and to some extent, took his place as Shen Dai\u2019s alpha and Qiuqiu\u2019s father. That is the identity that he couldn\u2019t restore no matter what he pays for now.He knew that the only person to blame was himself.Qu Moyu lowered his head and was silent for a long time before he said softly: \u201cYou are right. He helped you, so I owe him this favour.\u201dShen Dai was a little surprised. When he decided to say these words, he was already prepared to bear Qu Moyu\u2019s anger.His next words surprised Shen Dai even more. Qu Moyu said: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will not do anything to him. Lancheng\u2019s project is led by him. I am reluctant to let it go. The company also needs him. I have no public or private interests in this. No matter what, I don\u2019t want to embarrass you.\u201dShen Dai was startled for a moment. He quickly glanced at Qu Moyu with a complicated expression.\u201cAh Dai, I\u2019m here today to tell you that I wanted to \u2018mark\u2019 you that day not because I was stimulated by Bai Xiangwan. It was also not because of the impulse when I fell into lust.\u201d Qu Moyu stared at Shen Dai. His eyes were deep and heavy. \u201cI want to marry you. I want to \u2018mark\u2019 you. I want to make up for all the damage that I have done to you. I want to give you all the promises I can give and I want our family to be together forever.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s heel quietly rubbed back a step. His eyes flickered uncomfortably. Qu Moyu\u2019s sudden change made him feel a little at a loss. He couldn\u2019t help thinking about Qu Moyu\u2019s hidden intention for him to change. He knew how difficult the man was. Then, how could he turn to be so gentle?But he couldn\u2019t help but think that an S-class alpha is too proud to be treated coldly for long.Shen Dai quickly calmed down. He lowered his eyes and did not respond.Qu Moyu didn\u2019t expect a response either. He said, \u201cCan I take a look at Qiuqiu? If I can\u2019t get close to him, I\u2019ll leave.\u201d\u201cYou might wake him up.\u201dQu Moyu smiled helplessly: \u201cOkay then. I\u2019ll come to see you another day.\u201dShen Dai watched Qu Moyu walk out of the door, still feeling a little dazed. It was as if he didn\u2019t quite believe that Qu Moyu would do nothing at all. So he told himself a few words to be at peace with himself.He stood stiffly in the living room for a long time. His eyes fell on the box of carrot-pulling toys, thinking that Qiuqiu was indeed starting to practise grabbing lately.***In the next few days, although Qu Moyu did not appear, Shen Dai could feel his presence everywhere. For example, the research institute suddenly was sent with a batch of new green plants. All staffs\u2019 seats were replaced with ergonomic chairs. And consumer coupons for the opposite shopping mall were issued to them one by one. There was also news of the plan to comprehensively improve the decoration and dishes of the research institute. Night shift chefs will also be retained to serve people who worked overtime.Everyone knew that these actions were all done for Shen Dai.When the canteen started to be renovated, Qu Moyu personally came over to take a look. Since the CEO of the group came to review, it seemed like a major construction project was going to be carried out. In fact, it was just a simple renovation. It was just changing a batch of tables, chairs and tableware, and it would be completed in a week or two. But when he came, people had to come down to accompany him.When Qu Moyu saw Shen Dai in the crowd, his eyes seemed to be glued in place. He stared at him for about five to six seconds. Shen Dai was wearing a white lab coat, as how he was first seen the first time they met. This plain long gown with no tailoring would cause some people to look bloated when they wear it. And some other people will look straight like a pole when they wear it. But only Shen Dai, with clear bones, moderate thin and thick flesh and calm gait outline gave a touch of graceful, light, and very vivid white of the lab coat. The inner \u2018filling\u2019 is infinitely fascinating. Qu Moyu had tasted that body and he was far from having enough of it.Liu Xi stepped forward and thanked the leaders for their concern about the renovation of the cafeteria. He then asked the leaders for any further instructions.Qu Moyu said: \u201cProfessor Liu, the administration is now discussing the new menu with the chef. This time the budget is very good and the food supplements have also increased. If you have any requirements, you can directly mention it.\u201dLiu Xi smiled: \u201cOkay. There are a lot of people working overtime in the research institute. I didn\u2019t expect that Mr. Qu would be able to open a night-shift canteen for us. I\u2019m really grateful.\u201d\u201cYes. The research institute is one of the core components of the group and it also brings together high-end talents we hired from within the country and abroad. When you are concentrating on your work, the group will naturally provide you with a good working environment as much as possible.\u201d Qu Moyu said while looking at Shen Dai, \u201cIf you have any opinions on the renovation of the canteen, you can communicate with the administrative department.\u201dThe crowd said unanimously, \u201cThank you, Mr. Qu.\u201dShen Dai received Qu Moyu\u2019s meaningful gaze. He stood in the crowd and didn\u2019t want to stand out. But at the same time, he could feel that more people were paying attention to his actions, so he had to turn around. He looked at Cheng Zimei and pretended to discuss something with her.Cheng Zimei raised her eyebrows and said in a low voice, \u201cI owe this to you.\u201dShen Dai lowered his head expressionlessly. He has now adapted to the new working environment. To be precise, the new ecological environment of the public opinion. The negative evaluation and face-to-face attitude of others \u2013 no matter which it is \u2013 he has adapted to them. He has to adapt. Otherwise, he will be unable to work. Perhaps in Qu Moyu\u2019s view, such an expression is more subtle than blatantly delivering lunch to him in person but for him, no matter what Qu Moyu does, it will not change his environment too much. So he got used to it and it didn\u2019t matter.As long as he tamely accepts all arrangements, he would like to see how long will Qu Moyu\u2019s patience last for him to play these tricks that seem to look like he is chasing after him. He would quietly watch and wait in this anxious, chaotic, and fluffy life. At least, it will give him a relatively peaceful space with Qiuqiu. When Qu Moyu finally got tired of this chasing and remembered that what he really needed was always an S-class omega with a superior background to give birth to a perfect S-class heir, his predicament could be solved. By then, he and Qiuqiu could be free.At this time, a voice came from the crowd: \u201cWhat standard will this canteen be refurbished to? Five stars?\u201dThis voice sounded a bit sneering and mocking. The voice sounded good, but the tone made people feel uncomfortable. No one dared to go back with irony, because the person who asked that was Qu Chengchen.Shen Dai\u2019s shoulders stiffened and he didn\u2019t turn his head to look. He hated Qu Chengchen deeply. If it wasn\u2019t for Qu Chengchen\u2019s plan to frame him, he might have been troubled by not receiving Qu Moyu\u2019s love. But that kind of trouble was just a lovelorn problem that can be seen everywhere in life. It was far better than watching the person he once admired and looked up to walk down the altar and push him off into the abyss with his own hands.A string of voices of people acknowledging \u2018President Qu\u2019 resounded in the crowd.Qu Chengchen came over, deliberately stopped at the side of Shen Dai\u2019s shoulder and said with a low smile, \u201cShen Gong, it\u2019s been a while. Are you feeling better now?\u201dShen Dai quietly put his hand into the big pocket of his lab coat and clenched it tightly.Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes sank. He walked over, glanced at Shen Dai, and then turned to Qu Chengchen: \u201cWhy are you here? Aren\u2019t you on a business trip?\u201d\u201cI came back yesterday.\u201d Qu Chengchen looked at Qu Moyu. The two of them are of the same height and their eyes met like gunpowder as always. \u201cAs soon as I came back, I heard that my eldest brother is going to drastically improve the various benefits of the research institute. This budget is quite a lot.\u201d\u201cThe results of the research institute this year are very good. Isn\u2019t that what it should be?\u201d\u201cYeah. That\u2019s what I meant.\u201d Qu Chengchen smiled, \u201cThis is a great move. The output of the research institute has always been one of our company\u2019s core competitiveness, and I hope everyone can feel it too. To receive the company\u2019s care and attention from you.\u201dEveryone quickly echoed him.\u201cShen Gong?\u201d Qu Chengchen lowered his head. His body naturally leaned towards Shen Dai, \u201cYou have been on leave for more than a year. Do you feel any discomfort after you come back? Please tell me. Your opinion is very, very, important to all of us.\u201dQu Moyu narrowed his eyes slightly. There\u2019s a warning in his eyes. Since Qu Chengchen was defeated in their competition, the confrontation between the two has not eased because Qu Moyu managed to stabilise the rudder of Xingzhou. He is constantly crowding Qu Chengchen\u2019s share. wanting to completely drive his second uncle out of the company\u2019s decision-making level. So naturally, Qu Chengchen will not sit still. Now that Qu Chengchen knew that Shen Dai was very important to him, he might have bad thoughts again.Shen Dai said coldly, \u201cLet\u2019s just follow the leader\u2019s arrangement.\u201dQu Moyu squinted at Qu Chengchen: \u201cChengchen, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has a lot of decisions waiting for you to deal with. Professor Liu, Shen Gong, let\u2019s go to the office to talk.\u201dQu Chengchen smiled and said nothing.The three left the cafeteria and walked back to the office. In Shen Dai\u2019s office, Liu Xi left with a funny excuse.Sitting on the sofa, Qu Moyu looked at this familiar scene and remembered that he deliberately let Zhou Lan discover his relationship with Shen Dai back then. He protested his rival in love to a little boy who had not graduated yet. Looking back now, he was really naive and cheap. Unfortunately, at that time, he didn\u2019t realise that all his abnormal behaviours were due to his attraction towards Shen Dai. He had never been possessive before.Shen Dai stood leaning against the desk, waiting for Qu Moyu to speak.\u201cHow is Qiuqiu these days?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s good.\u201d\u201cI know that you go back occasionally to look at him at noon. But sometimes, you can\u2019t go back if your work is delayed, so you still have to eat at the company. Of course, the renovation of the cafeteria is not all for you. But it is also to improve employee\u2019s welfare.\u201dShen Dai nodded: \u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cOne more thing.\u201d Qu Moyu said, \u201cI know your grandmother is hospitalised again and the situation is not good this time.\u201dShen Dai was surprised: \u201cYou\u2026 How did you know?\u201d\u201cAssistant Cheng will usually contact your grandmother\u2019s attending doctor every once in a while to find out about her condition.\u201d Qu Moyu said, \u201cI have already arranged an intensive care unit for her. You can also choose whether to transfer her to a private hospital. The conditions are better, but the treatment of serious diseases is definitely not as good as the top three hospitals.\u201dShen Dai whispered: \u201cNo need. Let her just stay in the current hospital.\u201d\u201cOkay. If you have anything else to ask for, you can talk to Assistant Cheng.\u201d Qu Moyu paused. His voice softened, \u201cOf course, it is best to just tell me. I\u2019ll handle everything for you.\u201d He paused and continued, \u201cI\u2019ll do anything for you, as long as you ask for it.\u201dShen Dai pursed his lips. Even when he lowered his head, he could feel Qu Moyu\u2019s burning gaze. So he kept his head down.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.08.17\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: This virus named Qu Chengchen will cause trouble soon.

Shen Qin said that she ate a whole bowl of porridge in the evening. Shen Dai is of course happy. But he couldn\u2019t help to think that with just one word from Qu Moyu, his grandmother can get the best medical care. He has been calculating for the past few days whether to sell the house or not and he can\u2019t tell what to feel.Shen Qin said in a flattering tone: \u201cAh Dai, can you bring Qiuqiu over this weekend? I\u2019ve never seen Qiuqiu. Isn\u2019t it right, Mom?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Grandma glanced at Shen Dai hesitantly. She knew that Shen Dai definitely didn\u2019t want Shen Qin to see Qiuqiu, \u201cwait for me to leave the hospital. Children can\u2019t come to the hospital.\u201dShen Dai suddenly felt uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t know when his grandma would be discharged from the hospital, or if she could even be discharged from the hospital. He hurriedly said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. This ward is clean and quiet. I\u2019ll bring him here on weekends.\u201dGrandma\u2019s eyes lit up: \u201cOh, that\u2019s good. Qiuqiu must have gained weight again.\u201d***It was already nine o\u2019clock when he got home. Qiuqiu usually went to bed between nine thirty to ten o\u2019clock. He was a little tired today since he was busy with his own business, but he still wanted to give Qiuqiu a bath after that.Qiuqiu had gradually understood and got used to the fact that his dad was going out to work. When he entered the house, Qiuqiu was being held in the arms by the nanny, playing with the carrot-pulling toy that Qu Moyu brought.\u201cMr. Shen is back.\u201d The nanny held Qiuqiu\u2019s little hand and waved it, \u201cDad is back.\u201dQiuqiu\u2019s red mouth was grinning happily and he held a carrot in his other hand and stuffed it into his mouth.\u201cDon\u2019t eat. Don\u2019t eat.\u201d The nanny pressed his hand back.Qiuqiu went to grab another carrot.Shen Dai smiled and said, \u201che still have a good time.\u201d\u201cYes. The young master is very energetic. Among the children I have taken care of, he is the best in development. He will be half a year older in four months now.\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t develop well when he was first born. His physique was quite weak and he was a little premature.\u201d Shen Dai came over.\u201cIt\u2019s completely different now. It\u2019s getting stronger and stronger.\u201dAs soon as Shen Dai sat down with him, he smelled a familiar scent. He frowned slightly, lowered his head and leaned towards Qiuqiu. He really smelled the smell of Qu Moyu\u2019s ebony pheromone.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d the nurse asked in confusion.Shen Dai\u2019s eyes looked down. He wanted to take the carrot from Qiuqiu\u2019s hand, but Qiuqiu didn\u2019t want to let it go. As if he was thinking that Shen Dai was playing with him, he babbled on. So Shen Dai had to pick up another one to smell it. After smelling it, it is indeed the cold woody fragrance of ebony wood. It smelled very light, much like the smell left after spraying perfume.Shen Dai was a little annoyed. He didn\u2019t expect that Qu Moyu would play such a trick. First, he sprinkled a low concentration of pheromone on what Qiuqiu liked, so that Qiuqiu would relax his vigilance, and then gradually let Qiuqiu stop rejecting his smell\u2026Could it be that Qu Moyu also went to the hospital to make pheromone essential oils?The nanny didn\u2019t know why Shen Dai reacted that way: \u201cMr. Shen, a child can bite on this kind of mother-infant-level toy.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t smell\u2026\u201d Shen Dai then thought that the nanny was a beta, so she couldn\u2019t smell it. Moreover, she was the nanny hired and paid by Qu Moyu. So she might do what Qu Moyu asked her to do. He was out all day and Qiuqiu was taken care of by her. What could he do?The nanny looked puzzled.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s nothing.\u201d Shen Dai said, \u201cGive him a different toy to play with. This kind of plush is prone to mites.\u201d\u201cOkay. Don\u2019t worry. It will be old in a few days.\u201d The nanny said with a smile, \u201cMr. Qu has sent people a lot of baby products today.\u201dShen Dai asked alertly, \u201cWhich ones?\u201d\u201cThere are so many. Some toys, clothes, and daily necessities. Mr. Qu specially asked me to tell you that the saliva towels that Qiuqiu used before were not very good. The fabric is a bit stiff, so I\u2019ve changed to a few new ones.\u201dShen Dai walked over to open the drawer. He took out a few new saliva towels, and when he smelled them, they all contained Qu Moyu\u2019s pheromone.Shen Dai angrily closed the drawer. He grabbed the new saliva towel and walked over: \u201cSister Chen, don\u2019t use new ones for him. The old ones are fine. He\u2019s used to it.\u201dThe nanny\u2019s eyes showed a little surprised look. But she immediately agreed: \u201cOkay.\u201dShen Dai went to open the closet again and found that a faint scent of ebony wafted in many places. It already mixed with the original items and it was impossible to pick them out. He held the closet door with one hand and took a deep breath: \u201cSister Chen, Qiuqiu already has a lot of things. The old ones can still be used. He\u2019s growing too fast. Don\u2019t waste them.\u201d He felt dumb. If Qu Moyu sprayed the pheromone by himself, the nanny wouldn\u2019t even smell it. When she arrives, she will not be able to pick them out. If it is simply sprayed by the nanny at the behest of Qu Moyu, as long as she acts stupid, she will seem like she have nothing to do with it.Qu Moyu this bastard! Shen Dai thought.\u201cOkay, Mr. Shen.\u201dShen Dai turned his head and saw that Qiuqiu was still playing with the pulling carrot. He obviously liked this toy very much. He took it out and put it in his mouth. When it got wet with saliva, he replaced it with the next one. He went to pick up Qiuqiu: \u201cStop playing. Let\u2019s take a shower and sleep.\u201dQiuqiu kicked his legs in his arms, looking dissatisfied.***Although it was not like living in Qu\u2019s house, he had to face Qu Moyu every day. But Shen Dai felt that even if he moved out, Qu Moyu would still surround his life every day.Today, Qu Moyu forwarded a few articles to his WeChat, \u201cWhat to do with constipation for a five-month-old baby\u201c, \u201cPrecautions for alpha baby\u2019s glandular development in the early stage\u201c, \u201cInfants and young children\u2019s information to AO parents\u201c, \u201cHow to Guide Vegetarian Dependence\u201c.After waiting for a few hours, Shen Dai didn\u2019t reply to him. He deliberately raised a question about parenting so that they could discuss them. This time, Shen Dai couldn\u2019t turn the other cheek. So he replied, \u201cSister Chen has experience. If you don\u2019t understand, just ask her casually.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m reading the book recommended by Sister Chen recently.\u201d Qu Moyu took a photo and sent it over, \u201cIt\u2019s written in the book.\u201dShen Dai clicked on the photo and saw that there were more than a dozen books on Qu Moyu\u2019s desk. This parenting book is a comical contrast to the various financial literature and history tools on the background bookshelf.\u201cIt has to be combined with the actual situation.\u201d Shen Dai remembered that Qu Moyu sprayed the things he gave to Qiuqiu with his own pheromone and started to get angry again.Qu Moyu sent a voice note.Shen Dai hesitated to open it. Qu Moyu\u2019s gentle and magnetic voice came from inside: \u201cAh Dai, I have a strong learning ability. I can also be very experienced if I have the opportunity to practice.\u201dShen Dai put the phone upside down on the table and ignored him.***When he got home in the evening, Shen Dai saw Qu Moyu wearing his apron in the living room. The apron was a gift from Xiao Die, with Qiuqiu\u2019s 100-day birthday photo printed on his chest.Qu Moyu held a thread in his hand. The other end of the thread was tied to a carrot toy he bought. It dangled slightly above Qiuqiu\u2019s line of sight. Qiuqiu opened his mouth and stared blankly at it like a puppy. Looking at the carrot, his neck and eyeballs turned as it swayed, and the larks kept flowing down.Shen Dai was also stunned, not knowing how to react for a while.Qu Moyu looked at him with a smile: \u201cYou\u2019re back. You didn\u2019t work overtime today?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Shen Dai had an indescribable feeling of being out of place.\u201cI bought some food and wanted to try new complementary food for Qiuqiu. Sister Chen is cooking. I\u2019ll play with him for a while.\u201d Qu Moyu and Qiuqiu still kept a distance from each other. But he was slightly excited. He said, \u201cLook, I can play with him.\u201dShen Dai felt a little irritable. He said coldly, \u201cHis neck will be tired. Don\u2019t tease him like this.\u201d\u201cI think he is very happy.\u201d Putting down the carrot, Qu Moyu stared at Shen Dai with deep and affectionate eyes, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you for several days.\u201dShen Dai put down his backpack, lowered his head and pretended to organize his things. Until he felt Qu Moyu\u2019s approach, he was alert. He looked up.Qu Moyu walked to his side. He reached out and stroked his hair: \u201cIt\u2019s hot. You\u2019re sweating\u2026\u201dShen Dai took a step back subconsciously.Qu Moyu\u2019s hand froze awkwardly in the air. He slowly lowered his hand. His eyes couldn\u2019t hide the look of loss.Qiuqiu cried. Shen Dai walked over and hugged Qiuqiu. There was a faint smell of ebony wood in the air. At the same time, he could smell the white elm. Even he felt unwell by the smell and Qiuqiu seemed to be used to it. There is an innate blood connection between father and son after all. It is only a matter of time before Qiuqiu will fully accept Qu Moyu. But the closer it was to that moment, the more sense of crisis Shen Dai felt\u2014it was a kind of crisis where he felt like Qu Moyu was going to take Qiuqiu away.\u201cAh Dai, Qiuqiu is really not afraid of me anymore. Look at him. He is more and more curious about me.\u201d Qu Moyu emphasized.Shen Dai said solemnly: \u201cYou deliberately left pheromones on his things.\u201d\u201cIs there any problem with that? I\u2019m his alpha father.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes were a little complicated, \u201cSo you deliberately sprayed more Bai Xiangwan\u2019s pheromone perfume, right?\u201dShen Dai raised his eyes and looked at Qu Moyu: \u201cQiuqiu has been using it all the time. Why did you do this on purpose?\u201d\u201cSubstitute pheromone is just a substitute after all. My pheromone is What Qiuqiu really needs. Now that Qiuqiu has me, why do you keep obstructing this matter?\u201dShen Dai looked down at Qiuqiu. Qiuqiu was staring at Qu Moyu with curious eyes. Yes, he is still a child. He didn\u2019t understand anything. His instinct would tell him to explore. After all, there were countless connections between father and son that could not be cut off even though they were invisible. He couldn\u2019t stop Qiuqiu from wanting to get close to his alpha father.But this is his child. His own child. This is obviously a child that Qu Moyu doesn\u2019t want. Why should Qu Moyu appear in a grandiose manner after he was born and try to raise him, saying, \u201cNow Qiuqiu has me.\u201dWhy?Qu Moyu just looked at Shen Dai\u2019s with his eyebrows raised. He knew that the atmosphere was wrong again. He stood aside uneasily like a student who had made a mistake.After a long time, Qu Moyu said softly: \u201cAh Dai, I will not take Qiuqiu away. He is our child.\u201dShen Dai looked at Qu Moyu calmly: \u201cMr. Qu should not forget. The reason why I am here with you was that you threatened me with Qiuqiu\u2019s custody.\u201dQu Moyu\u2019s eyes flickered. At this negotiating table, he was unable to speak.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.08.18\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: This squid is very tricky.

She said: \u201cMr. Qu, the ingredients are ready. Do you want to come and try it?\u201d\u201cUh. Okay.\u201d Qu Moyu whispered, \u201cI\u2019m going to make complementary food. I\u2019m new at this.\u201dUntil Qu Moyu\u2019s back entered the kitchen, Shen Dai couldn\u2019t get rid of the appearance of this person wearing an apron from his mind. In his impression, Qu Moyu would mostly wear suits and leather shoes. And at any time, he would pull out a chair to sit down and talk about big business. Even at home, he wears the kind of silk pyjamas with a high-grade lustre. A golden treasure that is not stained with dust. A custom-made apron of only dozens of dollars is worn on Qu Moyu\u2019s body now. How to describe it? It looks like a thousand-yuan expensive honeydew melon imported from Shizuoka in a supermarket with a cheap price tag.Qu Moyu is out of tune with all of this. So why should he pretend to fit in?After a while, Sister Chen brought the prepared dinner to the table. Qu Moyu also came out with a bear bowl in hand.\u201cMr. Shen, come and eat.\u201d Sister Chen called.\u201cI\u2019ll feed Qiuqiu first.\u201d\u201cThe milk is already warm. You eat, I\u2019ll feed him.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You eat first. I\u2019ll feed him.\u201dSister Chen brought the warm bottle over. Qu Moyu sat next to Shen Dai and shook the bowl in his hand. He looked at Shen Dai expectantly: \u201cLook. The complementary food I just made. Guess what\u2019s in it?\u201dShen Dai glanced at Qiuqiu. The bowl was filled with a gooey of indescribable colour.Qu Moyu also didn\u2019t expect Shen Dai to answer him: \u201cIt\u2019s avocado and shrimp paste. It\u2019s very fragrant.\u201dShen Dai put the pacifier to Qiuqiu\u2019s mouth: \u201cHe can\u2019t eat so much.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll eat the rest.\u201dQiuqiu didn\u2019t suck on the pacifier. His smart eyes stared at the bowl in Qu Moyu\u2019s hand. He had just started eating complementary food recently. He couldn\u2019t tell the scent yet, but he recognized the bowl.Qu Moyu immediately understood and dug out a large piece with a small spoon.\u201cThat\u2019s too much.\u201d Shen Dai reminded.Qu Moyu wanted to pour the lump of shrimp paste back into the bowl, but the paste was too thick. He shook on it twice, unable to control the strength, and accidentally poured some onto his pants. His eyebrows immediately twitched.\u201c\u2026\u201d Shen Dai felt extremely helpless, \u201cIs it too thick?\u201dSister Chen hurriedly took a tissue and wiped Qu Moyu\u2019s pants: \u201cIt\u2019s not too thick. I\u2019ve tasted it and he can eat it.\u201dQu Moyu took a spoon and scooped it out again. He didn\u2019t scoop so much this time. It was carefully handed to Qiuqiu\u2019s mouth.Qiuqiu stared at Qu Moyu with wide eyes. He seemed to be hesitant, but he couldn\u2019t resist the temptation of delicious food. He also cautiously and tentatively stuck out the tip of his tongue, licked the shrimp paste, and then covered it with his lips. He slowly sips the paste into his mouth.Qu Moyu showed a surprised expression: \u201cIs it delicious, son?\u201dShen Dai also looked down at Qiuqiu. His small mouth kept babbling. He obviously liked it.Qu Moyu handed another spoonful. Qiuqiu let out a \u201cYah\u201d and happily ate it.\u201cAh Dai, look.\u201d Qu Moyu looked like he was asking for credit, \u201cQiuqiu likes this shrimp paste.\u201dShen Dai picked up the saliva towel and wiped the corner of Qiuqiu\u2019s mouth, feeling inexplicably awkward: \u201cHe still can\u2019t eat too many complementary foods. Let him just eat two more spoonfuls.\u201d\u201cNext time I\u2019ll try other ingredients.\u201d Qu Moyu felt an indescribable sense of accomplishment, which was unrelated to how much money he made and how much he had negotiated about business. This is different. Just watching Qiuqiu slowly accepting himself and liking to eat what he made gave him a lot of satisfaction. Only with Qiuqiu\u2019s approval can he open Shen Dai\u2019s defensive heart step by step.After eating the shrimp paste until half full, Shen Dai asked Qiuqiu to drink milk. But Qiuqiu was not very happy. So he only reluctantly sucked on the pacifier.Occasionally, Shen Dai raised his eyes and glanced at Qu Moyu beside him. He found that Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes that were looking at Qiuqiu were so delicate and gentle. It was like he was looking at some fragile treasure. He was stunned.He thought that he had seen Qu Moyu\u2019s disguise and the real him. He thought he had seen all of this person. But this side of him was something he had never discovered before. What surprised him was that no matter how ruthless a person turned out to be, he would have an instinctive love for his own future generations.***On Saturday morning, Shen Dai was going to take Qiuqiu to the hospital to see his grandmother.He fed and dressed Qiuqiu up. He put the boiled red bean porridge in a thermos box and brought some daily necessities.When he arrived at the hospital, his grandmother had just woken up. Although she was in good spirits, her body was getting thinner. In the past few months, it seemed to be withering at an accelerated rate.His grandmother was very happy to see Qiuqiu. She held Qiuqiu in her arms and coaxed him lovingly.Shen Qin was also very excited. He kept asking various questions about Qiuqiu and begged Shen Dai for him to hold the child. Shen Dai didn\u2019t want to make his grandmother sad, so she had to agree. But Qiuqiu was very sensitive and seemed to be able to sense Shen Dai\u2019s emotions, so he didn\u2019t even like Shen Qin. He would cry after being held by him for a while.Shen Dai could see that Shen Qin really liked Qiuqiu. But this liking was not because Qiuqiu was his child. It was because Qiuqiu was Qu Moyu\u2019s child. Perhaps Shen Qin saw in Qiuqiu the wealth that he could not get from when he had Shen Dai.When it was almost noon, the nurse brought lunch for his grandmother. Shen Dai also took out the red bean porridge. The thermos was open and it was still hot.His grandmother smiled as soon as she smelled it: \u201cRed bean porridge. I used to cook this porridge when you were in school.\u201d\u201cI wanted to make soup, but you can\u2019t eat greasy things for now.\u201d Shen Dai filled a small bowl for her, \u201cGrandma, come and have a taste.\u201dAs soon as the nurse left, someone knocked on the door and entered. Shen Dai turned his head to look and the whole ward was quiet.Holding a bouquet of pale pink carnations and a box of supplements, Qu Moyu walked in with a calm smile on his face.Shen Dai frowned and looked at Qu Moyu: \u201cWhy are you here? Did the director say anything to Assistant Cheng?\u201dQu Moyu didn\u2019t respond to his negativity: \u201cI\u2019m here to see grandma.\u201dShen Dai looked at his grandmother, only to find that both his grandmother and Shen Qin were rigidly maintaining their original positions. They were neither moving nor speaking. He just remembered how shocking it is for ordinary people to suddenly appear within a social distance of an S-class alpha. The powerful aura and superior appearance of an S-class alpha will make the scene of any simple life become full of storytelling. Nobody is not nervous when they\u2019re about to get so close to this tall, beautiful, gifted creature.Qu Moyu handed the flower to Shen Dai\u2019s grandmother: \u201cHello grandma. I\u2019m Shen Dai\u2019s alpha, Qu Moyu. I came to visit you today.\u201dShen Dai glared at Qu Moyu.Qu Moyu only smiled at Shen Dai.Grandma looked at Shen Dai at a loss and Shen Dai\u2019s scalp was tightening. He stood up and gave Qu Moyu a wink to signal him to leave.Shen Qin was the first to react. He stood up and stretched out his hand to Qu Moyu excitedly: \u201cHello, Mr. Qu. I\u2019m Ah Dai\u2019s father.\u201dQu Moyu knew that Shen Dai hated his omega father deeply and he also knew that Shen Qin used Qu Chengchen\u2019s money to plot against them, causing him to misunderstand Shen Dai deeply. But he still shook hands with Shen Qin calmly.\u201cMr. Qu, sit down.\u201d Shen Qin pushed the chair over, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to come to see grandma. You\u2019re so thoughtful.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s grandmother also whispered \u201cthank you\u201d and inquired Shen Dai with her eyes. She didn\u2019t know the details about the relationship between Shen Dai and this S-class alpha. She only knew that Shen Dai didn\u2019t say anything about his fears or his worries. He left his favourite job and went so far away to secretly give birth to Qiuqiu. Regarding Qiuqiu, she could imagine how much grievance and pain her grandson had swallowed alone.She knew that this alpha was not good for her Ah Dai.\u201cQiuqiu.\u201d Qu Moyu stretched out his hand and quickly rubbed Qiuqiu\u2019s little head, \u201cDid you miss Dad?\u201dQiuqiu was holding a red bean that was boiled until it went soft and was attracted by the sweet smell. When he realised that Qu Moyu touched him, the brief touch was already over. He only stared at Qu Moyu blankly, not knowing how to react.Shen Dai couldn\u2019t stand Qu Moyu appearing so calmly in front of his relatives as his alpha or Qiuqiu\u2019s father. So he whispered, \u201cLet\u2019s go out.\u201dQu Moyu pretended not to hear him. He was wearing a perfectly peaceful smile as he said to his grandmother: \u201cGrandma, Director Xu is the most authoritative doctor in this field. We will do our best for you. You don\u2019t have to worry about anything. They will take good care of your illness and I will take good care of Ah Dai and Qiuqiu. \u201cShen Dai\u2019s grandmother said embarrassedly, \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cMr. Qu.\u201d Shen Qin showed a grateful expression, \u201cI really want to thank you. Without you, my mother would not be able to live in such a good ward and get such good treatment. Director Xu is very attentive to us. You are so kind to our family. We can rest assured that Ah Dai already met such a good alpha.\u201dShen Dai looked at Shen Qin coldly. If Shen Qin knew how this alpha, whom he was so satisfied with, had treated him and Qiuqiu, how would he react? He\u2019s afraid it will still be the exact same reaction. Shen Qin doesn\u2019t care whether he has suffered or not. He only has a big dream of \u2018climbing a high branch\u2019 for him.Qu Moyu smiled and said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. We are a family. This is what I should do.\u201dThe word \u2018family\u2019 made Shen Qin elated, \u201cMr. Qu, if there was any misunderstanding in the past, it\u2019s all over now. When are you and Ah Dai going to get-\u2026\u201dShen Dai stood up abruptly: \u201cMr. Qu, let\u2019s talk outside.\u201dQu Moyu looked at Shen Dai with gentle and patient eyes: \u201cI\u2019m here just to deliver a bunch of flowers. I wish grandma a speedy recovery. I will leave now and will not disturb you.\u201dShen Dai went straight to the door and opened it.Qu Moyu bowed slightly towards his grandmother and said politely: \u201cYou have a good rest.\u201dThe two walked out of the ward. Shen Dai closed the door and stared at Qu Moyu: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cI came to visit grandma . .\u201dShen Dai was upset: \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d He couldn\u2019t figure out the meaning of Qu Moyu\u2019s abnormal behaviour during this time. He didn\u2019t believe in Qu Moyu\u2019s feelings for him. To him, this person has no feelings. And since there is no emotional drive, then it must be done for profit. The more he couldn\u2019t figure out Qu Moyu\u2019s profit drive, the more anxious he became. He was afraid that Qu Moyu would have any other hidden plans that he could not think of. So he was waiting for him to tell him directly.Qu Moyu could see the defensiveness and impatience on Shen Dai\u2019s face. He felt uncomfortable and his eyes dimmed: \u201cAh Dai, no matter what I do, will it make you unhappy? I\u2019m just doing this out of kindness. I just came to visit your grandmother. I just want\u2026 I want your family to accept me too.\u201dShen Dai shook his head: \u201cI only have my grandma. She is old and can\u2019t stand the stimulation. Don\u2019t you bother her again. And mostly, don\u2019t you even think about using her against me.\u201dQu Moyu took a deep breath: \u201cWhat am I using her for? Using her to please you? Yes. I want to be good to your family. I want to be good to you. I want to solve your troubles as much as possible and let you become happier and feel less tired. Is this also wrong?\u201dShen Dai stared at Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes, trying to seek truth and find out his real thoughts. But those eyes were bright and his emotions were real. So he lowered his head. He shook his head and said in a hoarse voice, \u201cDon\u2019t come here again.\u201d Then, he turned back into the ward and closed the door.Looking at the closed door, Qu Moyu\u2019s face turned a little paler. He came with the intention to show his favour. But his motives were questioned. It was such a bitter and unpleasant taste.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.08.19\u058d\u058d\u058dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alpha PredatorCH 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTitle: \u9876\u7ea7\u63a0\u98df\u8005 (Alpha Predator)Author\uff1a\u6c34\u5343\u4e1e (ShuiQianCheng)Translator: K (@kin0monogatari)Protagonists \uff1a\u6c88\u5cb1 (Shen Dai -MC), \u77bf\u672b\u4e88 (Qu Moyu -ML)\u058d\u058d\u058dMonday\u2019s hot news came about Chuanghai Group. It is said that Chuanghai\u2019s capital chain has been broken. Many debts have defaulted and the stock has plummeted.After Chuanghai was acquired by Xingzhou, it was considered to be forced to continue its life for a period of time, but the high debt and the unresolved business situation were ultimately unable to recover. They were facing the risk of delisting at any time. There is also another rumour circulating in the industry that after Xingzhou took away Chuanghai\u2019s mining and prospecting qualifications, Chuanghai has no high-quality assets left, and they have used some complex financial means to transfer risks to the market. This resulted in the stock price going all the way down. The final result is that although Xingzhou has to bear part of the debt, the benefits far outweigh the losses, and after a brief return to light, Chuanghai has slipped all the way to the bottom.Among them, the one who made the most profit would be Xingzhou Group. Xingzhou took the most precious qualifications from the You family with one hand, and obtained huge loans through the Zhou family with the other hand. Their own stock price is already high while the other side has repeatedly accumulated and then they sold Chuanghai\u2019s stock. They spent a year diluting the debt to shareholders and obtained the maximum benefit with the least cost. This was Qu Moyu\u2019s first battle after commanding Xingzhou. It stabilised party disputes internally and expanded capital externally. The battle was sinister, ruthless and beautiful. It also showed the industry the strength of this young president.Usually, the scientific researchers in the research institute didn\u2019t care much about the company\u2019s capital level gossip. One is that they don\u2019t really understand it. And the other is that it has nothing to do with them. But today, many people are discussing the rise and fall of Chuanghai, and how Qu Moyu strategize and integrate resources to lead Xingzhou upstream during such a bad industry environment.Qu Moyu\u2019s image in the eyes of employees can be called \u2018sublime\u2019. He is a perfect person who seems to have no flaws. Although the relationship with Shen Dai once became a hot gossip, the disparity in the status of the two and for him to \u2018give up a wealthy family to marry his true love\u2019 is so in line with various elements of fantasy fairy tales that Qu Moyu is looked up to in the eyes of ordinary people. The company\u2019s cult of his personality is also very beneficial to his management and decision-making.But Shen Dai always felt that some people deliberately discussed Qu Moyu\u2019s wisdom around him to flatter him. He pretended not to understand and did not participate in the discussion. After all, only he knew what methods Qu Moyu used to achieve those goals and he happened to be one of the cannon fodder. At the same time, he didn\u2019t think that these people were shallow and pointless. After all, he was also bewitched by Qu Moyu\u2019s halo until he got too close and was burned all over.However, this news still made Shen Dai happy. It can be said that the only happy thing since this time has nothing to do with Qu Moyu, but it is to watch You Xinghai\u2019s family fall. Three generations of glory destroyed by his hands. It is really heartwarming.Cheng Zimei said quietly: \u201cAfter this, your cheap half-brother probably won\u2019t be too proud.\u201dThen Shen Dai thought of You Baiyue: \u201cHas he posted anything on the Internet?\u201d\u201cHe and Qu Chengchen have broken up. This kind of young master, who has been spoiled since childhood, if the family goes bankrupt, I don\u2019t know if he can bear it.\u201d Cheng Zimei curled her lips, \u201cNothing is permanent in this world. Back then, I thought that to be born in such a family is only something to be dreamed of. But now, I would only wake up laughing.\u201dShen Dai smiled: \u201cLet\u2019s go. Let\u2019s have a good meal.\u201d***In the afternoon, a new batch of materials arrived. Shen Dai also had to wait for the equipment to arrive for him to run his data. So he gave himself some overtime. Unexpectedly, when he planned to leave at 9 o\u2019clock, it rained heavily outside. He saw that the rain was heavy and wouldn\u2019t let up soon. He did not bring an umbrella. He planned to wait for the rain to be slightly less heavy before leaving. He was the only one in the laboratory at night and the quiet environment seemed very suitable for writing. He revised his paper, completely unaware of the passage of time.That is until his phone rings.Shen Dai regained his senses. He picked up his mobile phone and saw that it was a call from Qu Moyu.\u201cHello?\u201dThe person from the other end of the phone didn\u2019t speak. It was as if he didn\u2019t expect the call to be connected so quickly: \u201cAh Dai, are you not asleep yet?\u201dShen Dai felt that Qu Moyu\u2019s tone was a bit strange. He glanced at the time. It was already past eleven o\u2019clock. If he didn\u2019t pick up the call, he wouldn\u2019t know it was already late. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll go to bed now.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t go to bed yet.\u201d Qu Moyu hurriedly said, \u201cI\u2019m almost there. I have something I want to show you. \u201c\u201c\u2026what is it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m getting to where you live now. I\u2019m driving.\u201dShen Dai looked out the window. The rain was a little light now, but it still didn\u2019t stop. It\u2019s so late. On such a rainy night, Qu Moyu wants to show him what?\u201cYou must take a look. I just want you to take a look.\u201d Qu Moyu was afraid that Shen Dai would hang up.\u201cIt\u2019s very late now.\u201d Shen Dai frowned, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou can only watch it now. You won\u2019t be able to see it tomorrow.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s voice had a hint of pleading, \u201cDon\u2019t hang up, okay? It will arrive soon. Only food a few minutes. I will go back after you look at it.\u201dShen Dai knows Qu Moyu\u2019s character very well. The more something hinders him, the more he will do it. The nanny and Qiuqiu had already slept by this point. He couldn\u2019t let him wake them up. So Shen Dai had to say: \u201cI\u2019m not at home. I\u2019m at the company.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re at the company? Is it because of the rain that you can\u2019t go back? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want me to see? Just bring it to the company.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be there right away.\u201dA few minutes later, Shen Dai heard a \u2018ding\u2019 from the elevator. Such a subtle sound is inaudible during the day, but in the middle of the night when no one was there, it was exceptionally loud.Then, the door of the laboratory was pushed open. Qu Moyu was half wet from the rain, holding a black umbrella that kept dripping in one hand and a pot of flowers in the other.It was a pot of Epiphyllum. The only dangling milky white flower was ready to bloom.Qu Moyu threw the umbrella aside and walked over with the pot of Epiphyllum. His eyes are full of joy and anticipation: \u201cLook. The Epiphyllum I planted is about to bloom.\u201dA faint fragrance wafted into his nose. Shen Dai recognised the smell right away. This floral fragrance that has accompanied him for nearly 30 years is very familiar, but the more familiar it seems to be, the easier it is to be ignored. When he smells the fragrance of the real Epiphyllum flower, his first reaction is that it actually smells good.Qu Moyu put the flower pot on the experimental table and wiped his wet face and hair with a napkin at hand.Shen Dai looked at him in a daze \u201cYou\u2026 just want me to see this?\u201d In the middle of the night, he came to him with a pot of flowers in the heavy rain. It\u2019s just to show him the short-lived flowers?\u201cYeah, it will only bloom for an hour. So it\u2019s good to watch it now.\u201dShen Dai looked at Qu Moyu\u2019s soft, wet hair, and then at the pot of Epiphyllum that was only soaked with water droplets. A feeling of unspeakable sadness arose in his heart.Qu Moyu would never know what the special significance of appreciating Epiphyllum blooming is to him.\u201cActually, there are several pots at home. Didn\u2019t you realise it? I have them in my office too.\u201d Qu Moyu gently stroked the slowly spreading flower with his fingers, as gentle as he was stroking his lover\u2019s hair, \u201cI heard that there are some short-lived flowers. It hasn\u2019t bloomed for many years. I don\u2019t know when it will bloom and I don\u2019t know how many flowers it will bloom at a time. It only takes an hour for them to bloom and then decay. It is so fragrant, so beautiful, but so stubborn.\u201d He smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s really similar to you.\u201dWhen he met Qu Moyu\u2019s warm eyes, Shen Dai subconsciously closed his eyes. He knew that he should pack up and go home now. But looking at the pot of Epiphyllum\u2026 This is a rare beauty that will only bloom once and it would be against the will of God to miss it. The memories of his childhood kept pouring into his mind and his heart was aching.Qu Moyu wiped his face, picked up the pot of Epiphyllum and placed it on the table by the window: \u201cAh Dai, let\u2019s listen to the rain and enjoy watching the flower together.\u201dShen Dai hesitated: \u201cIt\u2019s very late\u2026\u201d\u201cJust wait for a while. I\u2019ll take you back.\u201d Qu Moyu came over again and took Shen Dai\u2019s hand, \u201cIt only blooms for a short time. Don\u2019t miss it, okay?\u201dShen Dai slowly pulled his wrist back: \u201cOkay. \u201dOutside the window, it was raining and windy. The dark clouds had covered most of the moon. The sky was dark, low, and heavy. The strings of water droplets on the glass reflected the 24-hour lights in the core business district. Drop by drop into the starlight in the dark night. The two sat facing each other by the window, looking at the pot of Epiphyllum that was placed between them.The flower is gently spreading the layers of petals. At first, the outer long petals put their guards up. But it is like the guards slowly put away the long spear and opened it calmly, followed by the inner soft and transparent petals one by one starting to stand up. It was like a dancer shaking her flexible waist as she shivered shyly, bloomed, and finally bloomed to the extreme, revealing the cream-colored stalks. It was bold and beautiful. The intoxicating scent of the floral fragrance fills the entire space.Shen Dai looked at it and his eyes gradually blurred.When he was young, he had several Epiphyllum plants at home and he could always enjoy this beautiful view all year round. When the Epiphyllum was about to bloom, he and both his grandmother and grandfather would prepare hot tea and cakes and they would watch it while chatting. If there was a beautiful moonlight that night, it would be even more romantic. It was like a ceremony for their family. This experience carries his most yearning and unforgettable memories.At that time, his grandfather said that although the short-lived flower is beautiful, it can only be seen for a while. So when it is in full bloom, it must be beautiful to the fullest and we must also appreciate it to the fullest. Therefore, he was named \u2018Dai\u2019, which has both the beauty of short-lived flowers and the persistence of Mount Tai. He knew that his grandfather felt that his pheromone was not auspicious, so he wanted to use his name to make up for his possible shortcomings.He never felt that the Epiphyllum was unknown. People saw it as short-lived and the world saw him as fleeting. Everything has a spirit. Who can say that he must bloom longer than the Epiphyllum?If he can only bloom once in his life, he must use his best effort for this time.Shen Dai suddenly felt something gentle and generous caressing his face. He came back to his senses and found that it was Qu Moyu\u2019s hand.\u201cAh Dai, why are you crying?\u201d Qu Moyu gently wiped away the peaceful tears on Shen Dai\u2019s face with his fingertips.Shen Dai stared at Qu Moyu. His eyes were hazy with tears. The Epiphyllum and the person in front of him became blurred in his vision. The \u2018memories\u2019 that repeatedly tormented him seemed to disappear temporarily at this moment and he couldn\u2019t see anything anymore.At the very next moment, Qu Moyu held him close and kissed his lips.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.08.22\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: QMY is very smooth \u2026 -KPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It formed a contrast between the two extremes of rigidity and softness with the fragrance of Epiphyllum. But they are incomparably fitted together, as if made in heaven. The two of them recalled the \u2018mark\u2019 they once had. Ebony and Epiphyllum were once intertwined. You have me and I have you and we are inseparable. Every cell in the body seems to have the brand of each other. No matter how you suppress it, all it takes is a little stimulation to awaken the ancient memories. The \u2018mark\u2019 affects far more than the physical body. The \u2018mark\u2019 on the mind may not be completely eliminated in one\u2019s life \u2013 even if the \u2018mark\u2019 is no longer there.Qu Moyu pinched Shen Dai\u2019s chin. From the light kiss of the tender lower lip. It was so fast that Shen Dai couldn\u2019t think too much.Shen Dai\u2019s heart beat wildly. He instinctively stepped back, but Qu Moyu held the back of his neck. It was not until he pushed hard that Qu Moyu finally let him go. The intimate fit on the lips was gone, but there was still a palpitating warmth on itQu Moyu touched his lips with the pulp of his finger. As he was thinking about it, his deep eyes stared at Shen Dai without blinking. At the same time, he released the right alpha pheromone, which is a signal of courtship and it was a poison of charm. He saw the panic in Shen Dai\u2019s pupils, and couldn\u2019t help the wild beating of his heart.Shen Dai stood up: \u201cIt\u2019s time to go home.\u201d\u201cWait.\u201d Qu Moyu said softly, \u201cAfter watching its blooming, it\u2019s time to watch its curtain fall.\u201dShen Dai\u2019s eyes turned to the short-lived flower. As soon as it reaches its peak, the decline will also begin. In the past, he wanted to watch the whole cycle, but now he can no longer stay here. He and Qu Moyu are alone in such an atmosphere. Due to this flower, thousands of thoughts came up, making him flustered. He shook his head: \u201cI\u2019m going home.\u201dQu Moyu also stood up. He walked around the table and stood beside Shen Dai, naturally helping Shen Dai to pull the slightly longer bangs behind his ears. He said softly: \u201d Alright. I\u2019ll take you home.\u201dShen Dai stuffed his belongings into his backpack. He turned his head and walked away. He walked in large strides. It was almost as if he was jogging.Qu Moyu, with his tall figure and long legs, followed him in only a few steps. He managed to squeeze in before the elevator door closed, holding the pot of Epiphyllum in his hand.In the confined space, the fragrance of the Epiphyllum is even more refreshing. Qu Moyu imagined it to be Shen Dai\u2019s pheromone. His heart was itching unbearably. His omega looked distracted. While he was taking a good sniff of the smell that had fascinated him several times, there\u2019s a swollen feeling in his lower abdomen.Shen Dai was also very uncomfortable. Qu Moyu intentionally released his pheromones constantly. In the short dozen seconds in the elevator, his body was continuously stimulated like an electric shock. He had already tried to hide as much as possible in the corner. But he couldn\u2019t stop Qu Moyu from insisting on standing next to him.The elevator finally fell to the ground floor and Shen Dai quickly walked out.\u201cAh Dai, wait. It\u2019s still raining outside.\u201d Qu Moyu remembered that his umbrella had been left in the laboratory as he grabbed Shen Dai, who was about to rush out. \u201cWait for me for a while. I\u2019ll go back and get the umbrella. \u201c\u201cOkay.\u201dQu Moyu put the pot of the Epiphyllum on the ground and went back to get the umbrella.Shen Dai squatted down and gently touched the soft petals of the flower. He then took out a folding umbrella from his bag, turned around and walked into the rain.The company is very close to where he lives now. It is only a ten-minute walk away. It is late at night. The streets are empty and there are vehicles passing by occasionally. This city, which has always been noisy, is so quiet at this time that only the sound of wind and rain is left.But Shen Dai could clearly hear his own heartbeat. He wanted to go home earlier. He couldn\u2019t tell whether his rapid heartbeat was because he was walking too fast or because of Qu Moyu.The blooming Epiphyllum, the quiet rainy night, the gentle eyes and the kiss that seemed to be such a natural thing\u2026 They all flashed in his mind constantly. For Qu Moyu to run to the laboratory in the heavy rain just to enjoy the Epiphyllum blooming with him, this is not like what he would do at all. But in any case, he should not stay. What he misses more is not the flowers or the times when he appreciated them with his grandmother and late grandfather. It was the feeling of being with Qu Moyu. He should not let Qu Moyu get close to him just because of that momentary touch.There was a sudden loud horn behind him. Shen Dai didn\u2019t have to look back to know that it was Qu Moyu.The black phantom Rolls Royce is parked in front of him. Qu Moyu got out of the car in the rain, blocking Shen Dai\u2019s way. He said loudly, \u201cIt\u2019s so late and it\u2019s still raining. Why are you running around?\u201dOn such a rainy night, there was almost no one on the street. The street lights were dim, which simply provided a natural shelter for murder and crime. It was too dangerous for an omega to walk on the street alone like this.Shen Dai raised his head and looked at Qu Moyu: \u201cI\u2019ll get home soon.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still another street to go. Get in the car.\u201d For him to just speak these two sentences, Qu Moyu was already drenched. He watched Shen Dai dodging from looking into his eyes. His heart was so excited because of the kiss he had just stolen but now it had turned cold again. The rain seemed to pour directly into his heart. He lowered his head, \u201cOr I will walk back with you.\u201dShen Dai sighed secretly. He had no choice but to get in the car.Qu Moyu sat in the driver\u2019s seat. He wiped his face with a napkin and brushed up his wet hair that was stuck above his forehead. He peeked at Shen Dai from the rearview mirror and silently stepped on the accelerator.The car quickly drove to the underground parking lot of the apartment. Shen Dai was about to get out of the car when Qu Moyu said, \u201cI\u2019m soaking wet. It\u2019s so cold. Can you let me take a shower and change my clothes?\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201c\u201cI have my clothes at that house. I lived here in high school. If I go back this wet, I will catch a cold.\u201dShen Dai said, \u201cMr. Qu, this is your house anyway.\u201d\u201cBut now that you live here, of course I have to ask for your permission.\u201d Qu Moyu turned his head and looked at Shen Dai eagerly, \u201cCan I?\u201dShen Dai dropped a sentence: \u201cCan I say no?\u201d He opened the door and got out of the car. He went straight into the elevator of the building.Before the elevator door closed, Qu Moyu followed him in again: \u201cThen I won\u2019t go in. You just give me a towel. I have to dry myself.\u201dShen Dai silently pressed the number of the floor.The two walked to the door of the house and Qu Moyu took Shen Dai\u2019s wrist with a pitiful gesture: \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you here. Just give me a towel, okay? You don\u2019t want me to catch a cold, right? I\u2019ll have a meeting related to your laboratory tomorrow.\u201dShen Dai turned to look at Qu Moyu: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cMr. Qu, just be yourself. Don\u2019t pretend to be someone you\u2019re not. There\u2019s no need for that.\u201d Shen Dai paused, \u201cYou want me to be obedient, I\u2019m obedient now. What else do you want?\u201d Compared to the person in front of him, who made him unable to predict what he\u2019ll do next, the condescending S-class alpha is the real Qu Moyu. He finally saw that side of Qu Moyu clearly. He didn\u2019t want to try to guess what the purpose of his current actions were. Qu Moyu is the best at being frank and ruthless. It is better than to be this pretentious \u2018good\u2019 guy.Perhaps for him, Qu Moyu, who wanted to enjoy the short-lived flowers with him in the heavy rain, was more terrifying than Qu Moyu who suppressed him with his pheromones.Qu Moyu took a deep breath. The coldness of his clothes that were wet against his skin finally penetrated into his bones. He said sadly: \u201cYou ask me what I want. What do you want me to say? I could have \u2018marked\u2019 you that day and let you obey me no matter what. Or even if I don\u2019t \u2018mark\u2019 you, I can still find ways to make you be \u2018obedient\u2019 to me. Why do I still try to please you? Don\u2019t you really understand? I like you. All I want is the things that I didn\u2019t believe in before. I didn\u2019t take your feelings seriously back then. Now I know I was wrong. I regret it. I have done a lot of things that hurt you. I want to make up for it all. I want a chance. I want you to forgive me. I want you to like me.\u201d Qu Moyu\u2019s voice trembled slightly, \u201cI\u2019ve said all this. Is it not clear enough?\u201dShen Dai grabbed the shoulder strap of the backpack with one hand and held it tightly. His fingers were sore. He was confused in his mind. He stared at the ground in a daze. His eyes were full of questions.Is this what Qu Moyu really had said? Is this S-class alpha really bowing his head to him over and over again? Is this\u2026 true? He wondered.Qu Moyu held Shen Dai\u2019s shoulder with one of his hands and the door with his other hand, trapping the person in between his arms. He said softly, \u201cAh Dai, look at me.\u201dShen Dai didn\u2019t look at him. He didn\u2019t dare to look at him. If he really sees love in Qu Moyu\u2019s eyes that he can\u2019t tell the difference between what is true and false, how should he control himself? He is relying on his hatred for Qu Moyu to crush and tear up all of his illusions over and over again. Only then can the once strong feelings be sealed in this body that had been \u2018marked\u2019 by Qu Moyu. He didn\u2019t allow himself to still have feelings for Qu Moyu. Otherwise, it would be a betrayal to himself and to Qiuqiu. Otherwise, he deserved all the crimes that he had suffered.\u201cAh Dai, I\u2019m sorry. I apologise to you for all the mistakes that I\u2019ve made.\u201d Qu Moyu slowly pressed his forehead against Shen Dai\u2019s. His voice was so soft that it almost sounded like he was pleading, \u201cAll the grievances and hardships that you have suffered\u2026 I\u2019m willing to make amends for them. Give me a chance.\u201d He closed his eyes. His heart was full of pain. Shen Dai\u2019s silent resistance, his seemingly obedient disobedience, and the fact that he did everything possible to distance himself from him, had made his heart torn into a million times.That\u2019s right. He is a utilitarian businessman who just wants to get the maximum benefit at the minimum cost. So he raises his bets layer by layer and constantly adjusts his strategy. When he couldn\u2019t impress Shen Dai, he felt desperate for a time so he could only take out his heart as an offering. But if Shen Dai didn\u2019t even want his heart, what should he do?Shen Dai suddenly pushed him away with a strong force. His eyes were scarlet and fierce: \u201cYou are a person without feelings. You admitted it yourself.\u201d He did not accept Qu Moyu\u2019s \u2018love\u2019 no matter if it was true or not. He would rather believe that Qu Moyu has hidden agendas and never believe that the hellish torment he had endured is based on this \u2018love\u2019.He opened the door and entered the house, blocking Qu Moyu from entering the door like a flood of beasts.Qu Moyu looked at the closed door and stood there like a statue for a long time. His body was so cold that he seemed to have fallen into an ice abyss.\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.08.23\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: I\u2019m sorry for the delay.

Professor Liu Xi will report about the project and discuss the budget with the senior management. This is an internal meeting before the public meeting for investors. Shen Dai and Cheng Zimei must also attend the meeting.Since his return to Xingzhou, this is the first time Shen Dai has come to the headquarters. The last time was when he was resigning. Although it only takes five minutes to walk from the research institute to the headquarters building, he has never even visited the cafeteria there.There are thousands of people working in this building at the same time. He has finally adapted to the public opinion field of the research institute and his colleagues in the institute have lost their desire to explore his side of things. But this is a brand new scene. Out of the corner of his eye, he felt the veiled attention. He didn\u2019t feel more relaxed until he got into the elevator.They arrived at the conference room first. After waiting for ten minutes, the people who were involved in the meeting arrived one after another.Cheng Ruoze took Qu Moyu into the last seat and he sneezed twice as soon as he sat down.The executive on the side asked with concern: \u201cMr. Qu, what\u2019s the matter? Have you caught a cold?\u201d\u201cWell, the air conditioner is turned on.\u201d Qu Moyu said. He glanced at Shen Dai across the long table.Shen Dai lowered his eyes slightly and only made the gesture of a listener.The meeting started. Because of the substantial breakthrough in rare earth extraction technology this year, Professor Liu Xi spoke with much more confidence and the senior management also praised him.A senior executive was talking eloquently when suddenly the conversation changed. He said to Shen Dai with a smile: \u201cDoes Shen Gong think what I said is right? Shen Gong is young and promising. He is also Professor Liu\u2019s right-hand student. Let\u2019s listen to his professional opinions.\u201dThere were echoes one after another in the conference room.Shen Dai\u2019s hand that was taking notes stopped its movements.As a professional, Shen Dai is no stranger to this kind of compliments like offering flowers to the Buddha. His discomfort is not important. What is important is that these people feel that they have successfully flattered Qu Moyu.Qu Moyu put his chin in one hand and stared at Shen Dai. He said softly, \u201cThen let\u2019s hear some words from Shen Gong.\u201dShen Dai put down his pen. He nodded respectfully and paraphrased what Professor Liu Xi had said just now.The executive made an expression like he had benefited a lot from what Shen Dai had said: \u201cShen Gong\u2019s statement is too reasonable. This year, the institute will definitely achieve better results.\u201dAfter the meeting, it was lunch time. Qu Moyu invited the participants to the cafeteria together to have a meal.When everyone walked out of the conference room one after another, Cheng Ruoze stopped Shen Dai: \u201cShen Gong, wait a moment. There is something I want to ask you.\u201dEveryone knows that this is Qu Moyu wanting to keep him. The rest left quickly. Shen Dai whispered to Cheng Zimei, \u201cWait for me outside the door.\u201dIn the end, only Qu Moyu and Shen Dai were left in the conference room.Shen Dai waited quietly for a while. Seeing that Qu Moyu didn\u2019t speak, he glanced at the time: \u201cMr. Qu, is there anything you want to say?\u201dQu Moyu whispered, \u201cI really have a cold. But fortunately, I don\u2019t have a fever.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI just want to be alone with you for a while.\u201d Qu Moyu stared at Shen Dai with deep affection in his eyes, \u201cJust for a few minutes.\u201dShen Dai lowered his head, feeling extremely awkward.\u201cIt won\u2019t be for long. If I\u2019m left alone with you for a long time, I can\u2019t help but want to hug you, kiss you, smell your pheromones, and do more things to you.\u201d Qu Moyu licked his lips gently, \u201cSo it\u2019ll be fine if only for a while.\u201dIn the midsummer season, the air-conditioning\u2019s temperature in the conference room was very low, but Shen Dai felt that his face was starting to heat. He unconsciously took a step back. He was afraid that Qu Moyu would deliberately release some pheromones to affect him. The charm of an S-class alpha is like a weapon. Whether the lethality comes from pheromone or from himself, it is difficult to say clearly. Shen Dai must be armed with a strong mental force to resist him.\u201cAlthough you didn\u2019t even give me a towel, I can\u2019t bear to blame you for that.\u201d Qu Moyu stood up and approached him step by step.Shen Dai\u2019s hand in the big pocket of his lab coat was tightly clenched.Qu Moyu walked in front of Shen Dai. He suddenly lowered his head and kissed his forehead. He then said softly, \u201cYou go to eat. I\u2019ll come after I make a call.\u201dShen Dai immediately opened the door and left.Cheng Zimei looked curiously at Shen Dai\u2019s tense and cramped expression but she did not dare to ask.When Shen Dai thought of seeing Qu Moyu again later, he really didn\u2019t want to go to the dining hall for a meal. But he also couldn\u2019t leave.The dining hall at Xingzhou headquarters used to be his first choice for lunch. A long time ago, before he and Qu Moyu were involved in a dramatic marriage, that dining hall was the most likely place for him to meet Qu Moyu. During the few days of the year that could be counted on one hand, he could look at Qu Moyu from a distance and he would feel light and happy.Those days are simply unimaginable now. Just like his original self. It is also unimaginable that he and Qu Moyu will become what they are today.Sometimes, the closer people are, the farther they become.The conference room was on the second floor while the dining hall was on the ground floor. There were too many people waiting for the elevator at noon so they walked down the stairs. When they passed through the lobby, Shen Dai saw a familiar figure at the front desk.Shen Dai immediately slowed down and hid behind a tall alpha. Unfortunately, it was too late. From a distance, he saw the delicate and beautiful omega in a famous brand stretched his neck and looked at him. He raised his eyebrows and stared at him.\u201cDamn it. Isn\u2019t that You Baiyue?\u201d Cheng Zimei whispered.You Baiyue smiled and walked to Shen Dai\u2019s side: \u201cWhat a coincidence, brother.\u201dShen Dai nodded: \u201cHello.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here to find brother Yu. But I didn\u2019t expect to meet you. I\u2019ll treat you to a meal at noon. Let\u2019s have a meal.\u201d You Baiyue smiled, \u201cOr you can invite me. You must be familiar with the neighbourhood.\u201d\u201cWe are going to the cafeteria to have a meal prepared for work. And we have to discuss work. It is inconvenient for us to go together.\u201d Shen Dai said calmly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d After he said that, he pulled Cheng Zimei and left.\u201cHey.\u201d You Baiyue stopped in front of Shen Dai, \u201cThen I\u2019ll eat with you in the cafeteria. I heard that Xingzhou\u2019s cafeteria is very good.\u201d\u201cWe have a meal prepared for work, not a private meal.\u201d It was during the lunch break. People were coming and going in the lobby and someone had recognized You Baiyue. The two of them stood together so didn\u2019t they provide another wave of gossip material for his colleagues?\u201cI won\u2019t disturb you.\u201d You Baiyue suddenly approached Shen Dai and whispered, \u201cBrother Yu doesn\u2019t want to see me. Can you help me?\u201dShen Dai frowned: \u201cI can\u2019t help you.\u201d He bypassed You Baiyue again.You Baiyue grabbed Shen Dai\u2019s arm and said coquettishly, \u201cBrother, please\u2026\u201dShen Dai\u2019s scalp was numb. He inexplicably remembered what Qu Moyu said a long time ago, \u201cI like it if you act like a spoiled child\u201c. This ability is really hard to resist, whether it is because of it being useful or because of embarrassment.Cheng Zimei\u2019s expression was also very subtle.\u201cWill you let me go?\u201d Shen Dai said in a low voice, \u201cThis is the company. Why are you looking for Qu Moyu and why are you looking for me?\u201d Did You Baiyue come to Qu Moyu again because he broke up with Qu Chengchen?? You Baiyue is well aware of his own charm and Qu Moyu also admitted that he liked this type. They are indeed a good match.Shen Dai couldn\u2019t tell what he felt in his heart but he only hoped that You Baiyue would disappear immediately.\u201cBrother Yu won\u2019t see me.\u201d You Baiyue held on to Shen Dai\u2019s arm and didn\u2019t let go. Although he was half a head shorter than Shen Dai, he was still very energetic, \u201cI\u2019m your only brother. Don\u2019t be indifferent.\u201dShen Dai said with a sullen face: \u201cLet me go first.\u201d In the public, he really didn\u2019t know how to get out of this trouble.\u201cBrother, does my little nephew have a high pheromone level?\u201d You Baiyue blinked, \u201cYou are quite capable and I underestimated you before.\u201dShen Dai said coldly, \u201cYou Baiyue, I am not a part of your family. I will not be accustomed to you. You let me go or I will call the security guard.\u201dYou Baiyue was stunned. He stared at Shen Dai and his eyes suddenly became wet. He choked and said, \u201cEven you have to bully me, eh?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dCheng Zimei suddenly looked behind the two of them and exaggeratedly called \u201cMr. Qu\u201d.You Baiyue turned around.Qu Moyu was walking over. And when he saw You Baiyue, he frowned slightly. He glanced at Shen Dai nervously.You Baiyue let go of Shen Dai, walked towards Qu Moyu, and shouted \u201cBrother Yu\u201d with some grievances.\u201cWhat are you doing here in the company?\u201d Qu Moyu didn\u2019t show obvious displeasure, but he was cold.\u201cI\u2019m looking for you.\u201d You Baiyue stood in front of Qu Moyu. The two were very close. Most people would not dare to invade the intimate distance with an S-class alpha, but he had no scruples and said softly, \u201cBrother Yu, can we talk?\u201dQu Moyu frowned. Instead of looking at You Baiyue, he turned his attention to Shen Dai. But seeing that Shen Dai had no expression, he didn\u2019t know whether to relax or get nervous.Shen Dai hurriedly glanced at the two of them. The S-class alpha and omega standing together, it was simply made in heaven and dazzling. Other people are not suitable to appear in this frame. He said to Cheng Zimei: \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t leave.\u201d You Baiyue said, \u201cBrother, let\u2019s have a meal together. I haven\u2019t seen you for more than a year.\u201dShen Dai turned around and left. Cheng Zimei glared at You Bai Yue, looking very upset and followed Shen Dai.***The working meal was almost finished by the time Qu Moyu arrived. He replaced the wine with tea and had a cup of tea with everyone. He hurriedly took a few bites of food and then left again.Shen Dai didn\u2019t look at Qu Moyu the whole time.On the way back to the institute, Shen Dai realised that Qu Moyu had sent him a WeChat message: He came to me to talk about Chuanghai. There is nothing else.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that You Baiyue? He broke up with Qu Chengchen and then came to curry favour with the crown prince? Also, he actually called you \u2018brother\u2019 so casually. He didn\u2019t even think about how his scumbag dad treated you. He was so cheeky and shameless.\u201d Cheng Zimei complained all the way.\u201cLet him be.\u201d Shen Dai whispered.\u201cYou can\u2019t let him be. What kind of a person is he? Now that the wealth is over, even if the You family has some money left, it will not be enough to repay the debt. He still thinks he is a little princess.\u201d Cheng Zimei sneered, \u201cNow he knows that the best way out is to find an alpha who can afford his luxurious life to marry with. It\u2019s really shrewd and scary.\u201dShen Dai took another look at the message from Qu Moyu and threw the phone into his pocket.Cheng Zimei was right. Even an outsider knew about You Baiyue\u2019s purpose. But Qu Moyu said \u2018there is nothing else\u2019. If there is \u2018anything else\u2019, why should he care?\u058d\u058d\u058dNext update: 2022.08.24\u058d\u058d\u058d*Translator\u2019s note: I wish I had a friend like Cheng Zimei. -KPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
