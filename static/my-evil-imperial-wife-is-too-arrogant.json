    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1\nJul 31, 2022Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 1: Terminal Meridians\u00a0TrashThe moment Lou Mu Yan stepped into the Imperial Academy's gates, she received numerous types of gazes; of disdain, loathing, jealousy, ridicule, dislike, and of interest, that of which appeared like they were watching a play\u2026She sighed inwardly. What sort of failure was the original owner of this body that she looked like a pest in everyone's eyes! So many gazes and yet not one of them were looks of friendliness\u2014she was really speechless.Calmly ignoring all the unfriendly gazes, Lou Mu Yan continued towards the direction of the library.According to the memories of the original owner, the library of the Imperial Academy collected the most comprehensive list of books in the entire Empire, including books that recorded various medicinal herbs and Spiritual Herbs on this Continent. She now wanted to find out if this Continent had the Spiritual Herbs to refine the Marrow Cleansing Pill.She, Lou Mu Yan, a Cultivator with the Heavenly Spiritual Root at the Body Fusion Stage, encountered the battle between two True Spirit cultivators when she was breaking through to the Great Ascension Stage and, unluckily enough, was dragged into the spatial storm caused by their battle. Her physical body was destroyed, while her Soul transmigrated into the body of a natural-born trash with the Terminal Meridians constitution on Tian'ling Continent.Whether in her former life's cultivation world or the current world, both followed the law of survival of the strongest. Lou Mu Yan was currently far too weak\u2014any random cultivator could easily squish her beneath their foot.She desperately desired to increase her power, but if she wanted to re-cultivate, she was required to unblock all of the meridians in this body, otherwise she couldn't even feel the Spiritual Force of Heaven and Earth in this world, not to mention absorb it to cultivate. And the only way to solve this problem was to refine the Marrow Cleansing Pill and improve and eliminate this trash body.People with Terminal Meridians simply meant that their entire body's meridians were blocked, unable to unclog, and no matter how hard they tried, they wouldn't be able to absorb the Spiritual Force in the atmosphere. At most, they could only cultivate until Advanced-Phase Sword Apprentice in this world.On the way to the library, Lou Mu Yan could hear people judging.When one young girl saw Lou Mu Yan had passed by, she immediately went to her friend beside her, whispering, \u201cIsn't that Lou Mu Yan? Why'd she return to the Academy?\u201d\u201cOther than to chase after Chi Yi Xian,\u00a0why else would she return to the Imperial Academy?\u201d Another person replied in disdain.\u201cShe still has the face to return, how shameless.\u201d There was derision in this girl's voice.\u201cThat's right, Chi Yi Xuan never gave her any good looks.\u201d Mentioning the name 'Chi Yi Xuan', there existed a sliver of yearning in her voice.Another person continued: \u201cShe shamelessly chases after Chi Yi Xuan every day, the Lou Clan lost all their face because of her.\u201d\u201cExactly, why couldn't she have just been beaten into a handicap by Gu Yan Ran last time.\u201d Then she added: \u201cPfft. I almost forgot she was already trash.\u201d\u201cShh, lower your voice, if she heard you, she'd bring her guards to bash people again. Whatever you say, she still has her superior status protecting her, so what if she's trash? Not like we can afford to offend her.\u201d There was a hint of bitterness in her voice.Lou Mu Yan rolled her eyes but didn't bother debating with them. Her most important thing right now was to improve her constitution.Without power as the premise, her days were truly miserable. Using the barbaric ways of the original owner of this body, as if she had a brain spasm1, to bully others was something she really couldn't do.But in reality, the original owner of this body wasn't really that unbearable. Since she inherited all the memories and emotions of the original owner, in Lou Mu Yan's eyes, the original owner simply loved a person she shouldn't have and used simplistic and idiotic ways to deal with interpersonal relationships. Her reputation was only ruined by scheming people\u2014she wasn't a bad person.She actually pitied the original owner. She was born in the Lou Clan that was brimming with prodigies, yet she was a person born with the Terminal Meridians constitution. She didn't belong.Despite her strong background, it could never fill the loneliness and inferiority in her heart. So she used unreasonable and wilful methods to hide her hopelessness and struggles. She licked her wounds alone; wounds from unobtainable love, eventually resulting in her willingly dispersing her own Soul and relinquished the body to the current Lou Mu Yan.The library was situated deep within the forest of red maple trees. Within the forest, arrays were installed, and only those who bore the customised student badge of the Academy wouldn't get lost.A sea of fiery red maple leaves swayed with the wind. Beneath the sunlight, they were set ablaze, and even more gorgeous, forming a unique scenery within the Academy.At the very end of the Red Maple Forest stood a profound, ancient building.Lou Mu Yan's powers were inhibited after her Soul transmigrated, and she had no cultivation base, but her Soul was very strong, so she could use Mental Energy\u00a0equivalent to the Foundation Establishment Stage of her previous life. As such, she could perceive that there was a layer of energy protecting the library building.She also discovered that there were currently a few very powerful auras concealed within the building, probably belonging to the guardians of the library.The entrance to the library was open all year round. When she entered, she took out her student badge and gave it to the manager. After registering, she entered the inner room, followed the signs, and found a book titled \u300aTian'ling Continent's Flora Record\u300b.Lou Mu Yan took the book from the shelf and scanned a few pages. In it, there weren't just illustrations, but also detailed explanations. A satisfied smile rose on her face\u2014it was precisely what she needed.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThen she arrived at a seat beside the window and began to peruse the book.The ingredients required for the Marrow Cleansing Pill\u2014Red-Leaf Lotus, Snake Saliva Fruit, Flame Fruit, and Spirit Gathering Grass\u2014were all recorded, only their names were slightly different to what she knew in her previous world.But Lou Mu Yan frowned slightly. Based on her memories, three of the four Spiritual Herbs were easy to find\u2014they would be present in higher-end apothecaries\u2014but the Flame Fruit was rarely found on the market. If one desired it, they must enter the Blazing Mountain Range that was situated on the border of Yan'zhou Country.Regardless, she swiftly browsed through the book, imprinting every detail in her mind for future use.Holding a badge rewarded to him, Chi Yi Xuan entered the library to seek for a suitable support-type technique for himself. Just as he turned to go upstairs, in his peripheral vision, he caught sight of a young girl sitting by the windows, quietly browsing through a book.The young girl dressed in a simple, elegant purple dress, and her smooth black hair was tied with a black ribbon behind her head. There wasn't a hint of make-up on her beautiful face, only emphasising her exquisite facial features, while her pretty brows were slightly furrowed.Sunlight spilled on her from behind, and her whole body exuded a faint warmth beneath the soft light, while her temperament seemed as if one who had been baptised, transformed, into another who was peaceful, elegant, tranquil, and pleasant.Startled, Chi Yi Xuan wondered, was this person really Lou Mu Yan? He couldn't match this girl with the one in his memories who liked to dress in gaudy clothes and adorned mature makeup. He contemplated a little longer, then turned and headed to the second floor.After finishing \u300aTian'ling Continent's Flora Record\u300b, Lou Mu Yan found a few more books to read on the shelves that introduced Tian'ling Continent, and inadvertently found the \u300aTian'ling Continent's Demonic Beast Record\u300b.Interested, she read the entire book, and even memorised all the information. After stretching, she placed all the books back in their original places and left the library.Recalling the location of her residence in the Academy, she quickly walked out of Red Maple Forest. Just as she turned left, a jarring, provocative voice entered her ear.\u201cOh, isn't this Young Miss Lou? Why do you run so fast when you see our Yan Ran, were you afraid of being beaten again?\u201dLou Mu Yan looked back and found two boys and two girls walking out from another part of the Red Maple Forest. The girl that spoke was considered pretty, wearing a glaring red silk dress that wrapped around her hot figure, with an obviously fake display of charm. At first glance, it was a woman with big breasts and no brain.Beside her stood a beautiful young girl with fair, tender skin, a shy smile on her face, and who wore a light-yellow dress that gave her a gentle and refined temperament.Lou Mu Yan recognised them from memory\u2014the red-clothed girl, Zeng Rou, was the official daughter of a wealthy merchant of the Empire while the other was that 'white flower'2, Gu Yan Ran.Together with the girls, there were two men whose appearances were rather exceptional. One wore a stern face with a tall, straight posture, and was clothed in black which generated a masculine temperament. His whole person exuded a cold and arrogant manly charm. He was precisely Chi Yi Xuan, the original owner of this body's most beloved.The other wore a luxurious purple robe with a handsome appearance. His pair of peach-shaped, amorous eyes carried a flirtatious charm, but was hardly feminine, as he appeared like an unrestrained and unruly man who followed his passions\u2014the Fifth Prince Yun Jin of Yan'zhou Country.\u201cRou Rou, no need to say anymore, I had my faults that day as well.\u201d Gu Yan Ran said softly as she gently pulled Zeng Rou's sleeve.Zeng Rou casted a look of soft anger at her. \u201cYou're just too kind, that's why others will bully you.\u201dLou Mu Yan watched their performance coldly\u2014she really wasn't interested in these sorts of dramas. Her gaze swept over the four people indifferently, turned around, and was about to leave.This move surprised the four of them, especially Gu Yan Ran. Based on experience, this trash should have immediately charged forward, pointing at Zeng Rou, and erupted into curses. But why did she act so uncharacteristically today? Not to mention her style and make-up, as well as her temperament, seemed to belong to a completely different person. A bad premonition suddenly rose in her heart.\u201cLou Mu Yan, you stop for me right now!\u201d Seeing Lou Mu Yan blatantly ignore her, anger rose in Zeng Rou, and she yelled out.Chi Yi Xuan didn't stop them, his eyebrows furrowed. When he went to the library earlier, he also discovered Lou Mu Yan's temperament was as if it belonged to a completely different person, but when he exited, she was already gone.After exiting the library, he coincidentally met Yun Jin's group, so they left Red Maple Forest together, not expecting to meet Lou Mu Yan here. Yet today, despite meeting him, Lou Mu Yan actually didn't take the initiative to great and stick to him. He sure wanted to see what sort of tricks she wanted to play.Meanwhile Zeng Rou's call attracted the attention of the surrounding students, stopping each of them in their steps with the desire to watch a nice 'play'.1A screw loose basically.2probably a reference to 'white lotus' aka a fake female.Note: My first translated chapter!

Meanwhile, the original owner always conceded to give face to the Chi Clan. But in turn, it allowed this big-chested, no-brained woman to grow exceedingly arrogant, acting self-important.\u201cPfft, who do you think you are? If I want to stay, I stay, if I want to leave, I leave, must I ask permission from the daughter of a lowly merchant?\u201d Distain and ridicule oozed from her gaze.It wasn't that she belittled merchants, but that their overall status in Yan'zhou Country wasn't that high. In recent years, it was only because Gu Yan Ran's elder sister entered the palace as an Imperial Noble Consort that the merchant's status improved. Of course, it was probably also one of the Emperor's acquiesced tactics.\u201cYou\u2014\u201d This was the first time Zeng Rou heard Lou Mu Yan mock her without consideration of anyone's feelings. She suddenly didn't know how to handle the situation, and her face that was already thick with blush grew even redder as she held her breath in anger.Hearing the suppressed laughter around them, Zeng Rou's anger erupted. She drew her long sword, pointed it at Lou Mu Yan, and lunged towards her. Today, she must teach her a lesson.Seeing Zeng Rou wield her sword to stab her, Lou Mu Yan's eyes revealed some disdain. Even though Zeng Rou was a Middle-Phase Sword Apprentice and was one phase above the original owner of this body, but Lou Mu Yan had her own Flesh Refining Manual she learnt from her previous life. It was simple for her to avoid the attack if she wanted to. Within the one month she was recuperating from her injuries, she trained this weak body every single day.Just as Zeng Rou's sword was about to pierce Lou Mu Yan's chest, Chi Yi Xuan frowned slightly, but didn't stop it. He knew Zeng Rou didn't have the courage to kill Lou Mu Yan.Meanwhile, Gu Yan Ran appeared to worry, but she was delighted in her heart. Lou Mu Yan asked for this herself. So what if she had a noble status? If it weren't for her elder sister warning her not to provoke Lou Mu Yan anymore, she would've wanted to make another move and completely handicap this spoilt, reckless trash.Yet when everyone thought Lou Mu Yan was about to be stabbed, she suddenly flipped herself backwards, instantly avoiding Zeng Rou's attack.Her gaze chilled. She spun around and kicked Zeng Rou in the stomach, and as the latter hugged her abdomen, Lou Mu Yan grabbed her wrist, tugged her closer, then lowered Zeng Rou's body and kneed her in the chest.\u201cAH!\u201d Zeng Rou had no battle experience, so she could only shriek in pain in this situation.Lou Mu Yan's shocking behaviour stunned the audience. This trash had this sort of talent? It must be luck.\u201cStop.\u201d Gu Yan Ran said tenderly, but, inwardly, she wished Lou Mu Yan would give Zeng Rou a few more beatings so that Chi Yi Xuan could despise her even more. Lou Mu Yan ignored Gu Yan Ran's shout, lifted her foot, and directly kicked Zeng Rou to the ground.Zeng Rou held the place she was kicked, heard the ridicule of everyone, and, disregarding the pain of her body, screamed like a madman, swinging her sword towards Lou Mu Yan again. But this time, she learnt to be clever, guarding against the tricks Lou Mu Yan used just before.Lou Mu Yan sneered. What a stupid woman. No wonder Gu Yan Ran took advantage of her all day long.She simply used her Silk-Mist Steps to dodge the attack and dashed to Zeng Rou's side. An arrest knocked the sword from Zeng Rou's hands, then with one hand clasping her wrist, the other reached directly for Zeng Rou's face.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks[PA! PA!] Everyone merely saw Lou Mu Yan incessantly slap Zeng Rou's face left and right, yet they also felt the pain on their cheeks.Seeing the situation getting out of control, Chi Yi Xuan frowned and said coldly: \u201cLou Mu Yan, that's enough.\u201dLou Mu Yan was just feeling gratified\u2014she was already aggrieved when her cultivation completely fell from an almighty cultivator into trash after she transmigrated, but, aside from the evident concern from her family in the one month, everything else also made her extremely vexed. So she welcomed Zeng Rou who took the initiative to come up to her and 'allow' her to vent the little bit of her irritation and dissatisfaction. But that stinky Chi Yi Xuan actually told her it was enough and to stop? Why should she?Though she inherited the emotions of the original owner of this body, she could still forcibly let go of the intense love that didn't belong to her. She blatantly rolled her eyes at Chi Yi Xuan and continued to slap Zeng Rou.\u201cPfft, Yi Xuan, Lou Mu Yan doesn't even give you face anymore. Interesting.\u201d Yun Jin's amorous eyes revealed a hint of interest. Today, at first glance, he already felt that Lou Mu Yan had changed, but he didn't expect her to become this interesting.Chi Yi Xuan's face darkened, then said impatiently: \u201cLou Mu Yan, stop playing these types of tricks to get my attention, hurry up and let Zeng Rou go.\u201dWhen Lou Mu Yan heard Chi Yi Xuan say this, the anger in her chest burned even fiercer, and she stopped temporarily.When everyone thought she would release Zeng Rou, act cute and apologise to Chi Yi Xuan, she suddenly looked Chi Yi Xuan up and down, then said with disdain: \u201cAnd who do you think you are? This Miss isn't bothered playing with you anymore. Look at you, want chests and yet you have none, want a butt and yet you also have none. You don't even look as good as the purple-clothed handsome beauty standing beside you. I really don't know which eye of mine was blind to fancy you.\u201dHer words shocked the entire audience. What did she mean 'want chests and yet you have none'? 'Want a butt and yet you also have none'? What did a man need those for? Were men described in such a way? This is a blatant insult!\u201cPfft, HAHA\u2014\u201d Yin Jin couldn't help but roar with laughter. It was rare to see Chi Yi Xuan be the laughingstock, so he was exceptionally happy, laughed very openly, and felt that Lou Mu Yan was even more pleasing to the eye.Chi Yi Xuan's face turned dark, and cold air exuded from his body. He never expected Lou Mu Yan, who always obeyed him, would refute him in such a way. He debated whether to argue back yet felt he didn't need to dispute with an ignorant woman. But he also felt extremely discontent with Lou Mu Yan's attitude towards him.Gu Yan Ran sneered inwardly.\u00a0Lou Mu Yan, you're so stupid. Did you think you could attract Yi Xuan's gaze? A barbaric trash like you will only push him further away.Taking gentle lotus steps forward, Gu Yan Ran said to Lou Mu Yan with a look of righteousness: \u201cYoung Miss Lou, don't you think this is a little too much? Zeng Rou did not harm you, so why do you humiliate her so?\u201dLou Mu Yan took out a silk handkerchief and wiped her hands. Only after did she raise her head, facing Gu Yan Ran with a look of ridicule, saying: \u201cIs it only when her sword pierces my chest that it's considered 'harm'? Young Miss Gu, since you are Young Miss Zeng's best friend, why didn't you come out and stop me earlier? Only stepping out to demonstrate your righteous heart after you finished watching the show, is that not too late? What's more, is it in your place to tell this Miss what to do? Who do you think you are as well?\u201dWhen Zeng Rou heard Lou Mu Yan's words, she raised her head and looked at Gu Yan Ran with anger burning in her eyes.Gu Yan Ran didn't expect that after one month, Lou Mu Yan not only seemed to be a different person, but she was also so astute, resolving the awkwardness of her vicious and humiliating acts towards Zeng Rou, and even pushed the conflict onto herself.She wasn't afraid of Zeng Rou hating her, but she still needed such a stupid woman to be her shield and an excuse to do things in her stead.\u201cSo Young Miss Lou considers yourself reasonable for beating someone then? I saw Yi Xuan stepping out to stop you, therefore I didn't. Who knew you wouldn't even give him any face today\u2026\u201dGu Yan Ran said in a gentle voice as if having been put in a difficult position, while acting considerate of Lou Mu Yan, \u201cIf I stepped out, I feared that I would accidentally hurt you. If that harmed the harmony between the Lou Clan and the Gu Clan again, my sin would be too grave.\u201dLou Mu Yao curled her lips, smiling. This woman was certainly conniving. She only said a few sentences and it tossed the criticism back to her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Also, what do you mean you didn't think I wouldn't even give him any face today? Am I related to him in any way? It's not like I'm a shameful concubine of the Chi Clan that can't be shown to public.\u201d Lou Mu Yan chuckled and asked in reply disdainfully. Since Gu Yan Ran wanted to 'chat', she'll see it to the end. She wasn't like the original owner of this body who could only use brute force to solve problems.\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Gu Yan Ran's face paled. She hated that lowly status the most, that's why she hoped to improve her strength in the Imperial Academy and eliminate her identity as a concubine.She wanted to become Yi Xuan's official wife, and not some lowly concubine. Lou Mu Yan did well\u2014she successfully roused her fury.\u201c'You' what? Nothing to say? I really don't know why the little concubine set by the Chi Clan is still coming to the Imperial Academy to learn. The Chi Clan sure is at ease. Are they not afraid of wearing a few green hats1?\u201d It was utter nonsense, but Lou Mu Yan just wanted to irritate and provoke Gu Yan Ran.Hearing Lou Mu Yan's words grow more and more outrageous and unwarranted, Gu Yan Ran's face paled even more. She tugged at Chi Yi Xuan's clothes and called him softly, looking wronged and delicate, \u201cYi Xuan.\u201d\u201cLou Mu Yan, have you had enough? Whatever you do, I will never like you, just give up. Yan Ran will be a part of the Chi Clan in the future, she's not someone that you can slander baselessly.\u201d Although Chi Yi Xuan didn't have any romantic feelings for Gu Yan Ran, she was still the concubine that the Clan set for him\u2014insulting her was equivalent to insulting the Chi Clan. Especially the part about 'wearing a green hat', he just wanted to choke Lou Mu Yan to death when he heard it.Lou Mu Yan rolled her eyes, raised her eyebrow and sneered: \u201cUs two females are quarrelling, what is a male like you butting in for? Or do you want to be known as the crazy househusband in the Empire? This Miss has no interest in you already. The person who liked you is dead, so please don't misunderstand and narcissistically think I still have feelings for you anymore.\u201d\u201cHumph, you sure are glib now. So unreasonable.\u201d Chi Yi Xuan simply couldn't communicate with Lou Mu Yan anymore. She was absolutely unreasonable today\u2014he couldn't outmatch her.Seeing that Chi Yi Xuan clearly didn't want to continue to speak to Lou Mu Yan, glee rose in Gu Yan Ran's heart. She had always felt that Chi Yi Xuan actually did care for Lou Mu Yan, but he just hadn't realised it yet. After all, they were childhood sweethearts. So that's why, ever since she enrolled into the Imperial Academy, she tried her best to deepen the conflict and completely destroy the relationship between the two.Now the idiot Lou Mu Yan actually said such things, her schemes really didn't go to waste. But the debt of insulting her must be paid.\u201cLou Mu Yan, you were too much. Was last time's lesson not enough? I want you to publicly apologise to me, or else I'll pursue this further.\u201d On the surface, Gu Yan Ran appeared to be slightly aggrieved, yet was unyielding as she looked at Lou Mu Yan. It made many men nearby pity her and cast unkind gazes onto Lou Mu Yan.Lou Mu Yan folded her arms, raised her eyebrows lazily and said: \u201cLook at you deliberately showing off a delicate appearance. The men around you don't even need to drink alcohol and their already drunk for you. I think it's not far from wearing a green hat with such obvious seduction. And apologise in public? You think you're worthy with your status? And how do you plan on pursuing this further, hm?\u201d\u201cYou're courting death!\u201d Even though Gu Yan Ran was conniving, she was still only a fifteen-year-old girl. How could she endure such insults from her most hated person? Blinded by anger, she pulled out her sword and leapt at Lou Mu Yan.A smile flashed past Lou Mu Yan's face\u2014she was waiting for this. She used her Silk-Mist Steps and glided around Gu Yan Ran. When her Mental Energy captured Gu Yan Ran approaching, her figure stalled, allowing Gu Yan Ran's sword to pierce through her left shoulder.Gu Yan Ran was taken aback for a moment before she was sent flying back from a wave of energy.\u201cPU!\u201d A mouthful of blood spurted out. Gu Yan Ran held her chest and lifted her head, staring at the white-clothed man who suddenly appeared. Her pupils constricted\u2014that man actually returned.All everyone saw was a white-clothed man who walked over slowly. He was extremely handsome, with a gentle temperament that carried a sense of otherworldliness like a fallen immortal. He simply flicked his sleeve earlier, and Gu Yan Ran was injured, showing his insane strength.'The young woman was a jade beauty, and the young man was peerless2'. This was the impression he left on others.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cYan'er, are you ok?\u201d The white-clothed man walked to Lou Mu Yan's side, asking dotingly and in concern.Lou Mu Yan pressed her injured shoulder with a look of grievance, crying: \u201cBig brother, you're finally back.\u201dThis man that was like a fallen immortal was precisely Lou Mu Yan's blood-related eldest brother, Lou Mu Bai, and was also the entire Yan'zhou Country's peerless genius. He entered into the powerful ranks of the Sword Spirit Stage at the age of sixteen. At nineteen right now, he was already at Peak-Phase Sword Spirit Stage, was in the Celestial Class of the Imperial Academy, and was one of the most influential figures of the Academy.He was cold and indifferent, but he was exceptionally protective, especially towards his younger sister Lou Mu Yan whom he doted on and cherished. A year ago, he left to train and gain experience, that's why so many people in the Academy dared to openly bully Lou Mu Yan.\u201cSenior Lou, don't you need to explain why you injured me without even asking who's right and wrong?\u201d The jealousy and unwillingness in Gu Yan Ran's eyes were quickly hidden by her, then she asked Lou Mu Bai in a harsh, yet meek tone.Lou Mu Bai didn't even bother to look at her, took out a bottle of medicine for physical wounds from his interspatial ring, and poured it on Lou Mu Yan's wound. After seeing the wound stop bleeding, he replied flatly: \u201cSo what if I injured you? A shameful outsider like you isn't even worthy of teaching my little sister.\u201d\u201cYou two are using your status to bully others. If Lou Mu Yan doesn't apologise to me today, I won't let this slide. Otherwise I'll go straight to the Emperor to ask for an explanation.\u201d Gu Yan Ran choked with teary eyes as if she had been wronged yet wanted to appear strong and unyielding against forces of evil.The corner of Lou Mu Yan's eye twitched. This woman was so deeply immersed in her character. She snorted coldly: \u201cWhat does my big brother need to explain to you? The fact that you stabbed me today, I similarly won't let it slide.\u201dLou Mu Yan thought a little more, then provoked Gu Yan Ran, saying coldly: \u201cSince you're that powerful, how about we have a fight after three months during the Academy's annual competition to see who's stronger? If I lose, I'll apologise to you in front of the whole Academy. If you lose, you'll admit that you plotted against me first, then purposefully injured me, and apologise to me. How about that? Do you dare?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Gu Yan Ran honestly didn't know what was going on in that trash's brain. She actually wanted to compete against her in combat? What a joke. She was stronger than that trash by an entire stage\u2014she definitely wouldn't lose. This was a perfect chance to ruthlessly trample on Lou Mu Yan, a noble, under her foot. She definitely wouldn't refuse such an opportunity.A trace of cunning flashed in Lou Mu Yan's eyes. She deliberately let Gu Yan Ran injure her, then took the opportunity to allow others to think she declared this challenge while emotional. On the day, she'll make sure Gu Yan Ran couldn't even cry.A few days ago, she received a message that Lou Mu Bai would return to the Academy today. Based on the memories of the original owner, this big brother doted on and loved this little sister dearly.And Lou Mu Bai's aura had long been imprinted into her memory, so she used her Mental Energy to lock on to Lou Mu Bai's aura. The moment she felt Lou Mu Bai near her, the moment she used her words to anger Gu Yan Ran, then proposed a competition. Gu Yan Ran was already emotional due to the insults and humiliation, coupled with Lou Mu Bai's forceful oppression, so as she expected, the 'white lotus'3\u00a0readily agreed.The original owner of the body was previously schemed against by Gu Yan Ran and her company, resulting in her death. Now they were still relentless. Lou Mu Yan adhered to the principle of 'if one didn't offend me, I wouldn't offend them; if one offended me, I'll pay them back thousand-fold'.The most important thing to Gu Yan Ran was face and vanity. If she were to be defeated, in front of the Academy's teachers and entire student body, by a trash, she definitely couldn't take it. By then, it would ultimately leave a heart demon, so if she wanted to break through the bottlenecks of higher cultivation stages, she would meet with obstacles set by a demon. From then onwards, she would never be able to step into the pinnacle of cultivation in this lifetime. The most ruthless return to her enemy was not to let her die, but to toy her to her death.And everything fell into the eyes of a devilishly handsome man who stood by the window of an old building beside the scene. He turned to leave and muttered: \u201cWhat an interesting woman.\u201d1cheating2basically Lou Mu Bai is very handsome3a girl who is fake in personalityPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

One of the plain-looking girls who dressed simply said: \u201cDid Lou Mu Yan go crazy? She actually promised a fight with Gu Yan Ran. Was she trying to vie for Chi Yi Xuan with Gu Yan Ran again?\u201d\u201cYeah, she actually wants to fight for him against Gu Yan Ran. In what way could she compare to her? Gu Yan Ran was currently an Initial-Phase impeGreat Sword Master and she was only an Initial-Phase Sword Apprentice. I heard she only got there because the Lou Clan spent a vast amount of money to buy high-grade medicinal resources for her. With her condition, she actually dared to initiate a challenge, did she want to die?\u201d Another fancily dressed woman said with disdain.Another person stepped up and said bitterly: \u201cIt's because her identity's higher than Gu Yan Ran. After all, she's got an Empress as an aunt, a Marshal for a grandfather who helped found the country, and the Imperial Capital's God of War for a father.\u201d\u201cBut even though Gu Yan Ran comes from a family of merchants, ever since her elder sister entered the imperial harem, she had always been favoured by the Emperor and rose to the Imperial Noble Consort status after only two years. Plus her clan's the Imperial Capital's richest clan. While her status isn't higher than the trash's, it wasn't too low either and just worthy enough for Chi Yi Xuan.\u201d The fancily dressed woman continued.The first girl sneered: \u201cYeah, just last month she clashed with Gu Yan Ran and was accidentally severely injured. Who knew the moment she recovered, she'd shamelessly come back to the Academy? But so what if her background was strong? Since she was unreasonably causing trouble, even if the Lou Clan wanted to support her, they had no reason to. In the end it was the Prime Minister who became the peacemaker and the case fizzled out.\u201d\u201cWas her brain actually kicked by a donkey? She even dared to propose a challenge. Was she not afraid that the Lou Clan would lose all their face because of her?\u201d\u201cWho cares, when the time comes, we'll just watch a good show.\u201dLou Mu Yan and Gu Yan Ran's promised battle spread throughout the Academy within only one day, and similar gossip could be heard everywhere within the Academy. The unanimous thoughts were that Lou Mu Yan's brain had a stroke, she was looking for a beating, and was probably trying to play some sort of tricks to attract Chi Yi Xuan's attention again. Basically, everyone in the school was waiting for a good show.After Lou Mu Bai bandaged Lou Mu Yan, he looked at her with concern and asked: \u201cWhy do you want to fight Gu Yan Ran? You aren't her opponent.\u201d\u201cRight now I'm not her opponent, but I will be after three months. Don't worry, big brother.\u201d Ever since Lou Mu Yan inherited the memories of the original owner and agreed to live well in her stead, she was trying to integrate herself into the Lou Clan and treat the people of the Lou Clan as true family.Lou Mu Bai looked at Lou Mu Yan with a complicated expression\u2014his little sister actually changed.When Lou Mu Yan was born, the Imperial Capital's Divine Seer told them that she would encounter a life and death situation at fifteen years old, but once she successfully overcame the situation, she'd be enlightened and completely change. Their family was told not to be surprised as this was a fortuitous opportunity and she may even be able to walk the path of the strong because of that. Now he couldn't help but believe the result of the Divine Seer's divination. Though a sister like this assured him even more.\u201cThen how do you plan on surpassing her? Have you thought it through?\u201d Lou Mu Bai asked with a soft smile.When Lou Mu Yan first entered this body, half-dead and in a conscious coma, she overheard her mother talk about how there was a person who divined that when she turned fifteen, her personality would change drastically. Therefore, she gradually revealed her true nature without concealing anything and let the members of the Lou Clan slowly adapt to her as their daughter. Even though this was the first time she saw Lou Mu Bai, but because she inherited the original owner's feelings, she felt close to this big brother of hers.Lou Mu Yan pretended to be confused, as if recollecting something. After thinking for a while, she said: \u201cBig brother, when I was injured and unconscious, I dreamt that I went to another world. There, the cultivation system was different to ours. I felt like I experienced thousands of years and learnt a lot of things, one of which was the Marrow Cleansing Pill that could change Terminal Meridians constitution.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksSeeing shock in Lou Mu Bai's eyes, she continued: \u201cI could eradicate my Terminal Meridians constitution completely and the blocked meridians could be unclogged as long as I take the Marrow Cleansing Pill.\u201d\u201cReally? That's fantastic! Do you know what ingredients are required for this type of pill?\u201d Lou Mu Bai's eyes were filled with joy and excitement.Lou Mu Yan nodded: \u201cI know, and I can also refine it. I went to the Academy's library today to research. Even though the names of the Spiritual Herbs between the two worlds were different, according to the medicinal properties and the illustration on the books, they were definitely the same thing.\u201d\u201cYan'er, it's a blessing in disguise this time. What Spiritual Herbs do you need? Write it down, big brother will go find it for you.\u201d Lou Mu Bai caressed Lou Mu Yan's head with a gentle smile.Lou Mu Yan didn't dislike this gesture. Then she wrote down the names of the Spiritual Herbs and handed it to Lou Mu Bai. \u201cThese are the herbs. The rest are fine, but the Flame Fruit is a bit troublesome.\u201dAfter reading the list of herbs, Lou Mu Bai frowned slightly, \u201cThe Flame Fruit is definitely a little troublesome, but little sister, don't worry, I'll definitely find it for you.\u201d\u201cThank you big brother, I'll also look for it as well. Before the battle, I'll definitely refine the Marrow Cleansing Pill and improve my constitution. At that time, I'll also take back the stage I lost last time.\u201d A layer of coldness surfaced in her eyes.Lou Mu Bai's face darkened, and he nodded: \u201cRecently the Gu Clan has been very arrogant. Even aunty in the palace is being suppressed by Imperial Noble Consort Gu. If it wasn't that the Imperial Capital was preparing for war, and the Imperial Family needs funds from the Gu Clan, your incident last time wouldn't be suppressed like that.\u201dWhen Lou Mu Yan was injured by Gu Yan Ran last time, Lou Mu Bai happened to be out training. There were two main reasons why the Lou Clan didn't pursue it until the end. One was that the Imperial Family intervened, hoping the Lou Clan wouldn't pursue any further. After all, Lou Mu Yan was fine in the end. And second, it was just as the divination said, Lou Mu Yan indeed recovered from near-death. Only because of this did the Lou Clan not pursue the issue further against the Gu Clan.\u201cBy the way, about the challenge, I need big brother to put in a few good words for me when we return home. Otherwise grandfather and father and them will think I'm being wilful again.\u201d Lou Mu Yan begged as she hugged Lou Mu Bai's arm and swung it back and forth.The reason why she provoked Gu Yan Ran to promise a fight only after she locked onto Lou Mu Bai's aura was so that he could deal with the Lou Clan. She definitely wouldn't be able to handle the tears of her beautiful mother.Lou Mu Bai nodded helplessly, saying dotingly: \u201cI really don't know what to do with you. Settle a little for the time being. I fear the entire population of the Imperial Capital knows of your challenge with Gu Yan Ran.\u201d\u201cDon't worry big brother, I will.\u201dAfter her heavenly eldest brother left, Lou Mu Yan began to think about what to do next.She planned to go to the Mercenary Union to see if there were any missions to the Blazing Mountain Range. The effects of the Flame Fruit could only be preserved for two months, so it'd be extremely difficult to find in the Imperial Capital. Instead of wasting time waiting without certainty, it was more reliable for her to seek for it herself.She initially wanted to go home, but realised that if she went home now, she'd definitely be interrogated about the issue regarding the battle and might even draw out her mother's tears. So she decided she might as well not to return home for the time being. She'd return after Lou Mu Bai spoke with them.Her residence was situated in a serene area. It was an independent, small courtyard and was a place specifically provided to children and disciples of meritorious clans by the Imperial Capital. It was a symbol of identity and status and wasn't something that could be bought with money. So it stirred the jealousy of many people when a weak person like Lou Mu Yan could inhabit this courtyard\u2014Gu Yan Ran and Zeng Rou were amongst them.After viewing the courtyard, she immediately collapsed onto her bed and fell deep asleep. She was very tired today\u2014this body still required more exercise and training. So she decided to have a good rest and take a trip to the Mercenary Union early tomorrow morning.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 5: The Mercenary\u00a0UnionEarly next morning, Lou Mu Yan went to the Imperial Capital's liveliest street. A branch of the Mercenary Union was located at the end of that street.The Mercenary Union was branched all over the continent, and it was easy to join\u2014one only needed ten silver coins to register and receive a low-rank mercenary badge.If one wanted to build their own party, then it required one gold coin and the leader must be at least a Great Sword Master. Each party member would then be issued a party medal. But regardless of whether it was a single Mercenary or a party, as long as their task was completed, then their personal badges would be upgraded.Along the way, there were numerous vendors and street stalls everywhere, with the employees of various shops vying for customers. The lively streets were full of yelling and peddling. They sold anything, but the most-sold items were still those used by Mercenaries.Lou Mu Yan browsed the area with interest at first, but the things for sale were rather low-level and useless to her. Meanwhile, seeing that her clothing wasn't ordinary, owners of small vendors rushed over to sell their goods. She immediately dismissed the thought to continue perusing and walked into the Mercenary Union.The door of the Mercenary Union was wide open, with people flooding in and out, and was also very lively. There was a large hall upon entering, and in the middle was a circular stone table, with a height that came up to just above Lou Mu Yan's abdomen. Sitting behind the desk were a few people in uniforms who were doing registration while Mercenaries stood around them.She didn't rush to register, and instead walked towards the bulletin board that displayed the latest missions and started browsing.The Mercenary Union's missions were divided into ten ranks, Rank 1 being the lowest, and Rank 10 being the highest. Each rank had its differences in difficulty and rewards. After looking through it, she found a mission to the Blazing Mountain Range in a corner.\u300aRank 3 Mission: Travel to the Blazing Mountain Range to find a Tier 2 fire attribute Demonic Beast with no restrictions to the species. The reward is one-thousand gold coins.\u300bAs she read this task, Lou Mu Yan frowned. This task for individual Mercenaries wasn't suitable for her. She wasn't familiar with the Blazing Mountain Range\u2014it was best if she could take a party task. So she turned to the round stone table in the middle of the lobby for a consultation.\u201cDoes Young Miss need any help?\u201d A young man who just happened to be free asked Lou Mu Yan with a smile.Lou Mu Yan nodded, lightly smiled, and said: \u201cI want to ask, aside from the missions posted on the bulletin board, are there any other missions issued for the Blazing Mountain Range?\u201d\u201cI'll check for you, please wait a moment.\u201d The man quickly found a book and started flipping through it. After that, he raised his head and asked: \u201cDo you have a requirement for when the mission was issued?\u201d\u201cRecently issued, best if it's a party mission.\u201d Lou Mu Yan replied.The Young Man nodded, searched a while longer, then pointed at the book and said to Lou Mu Yan: \u201cThere are two fitting your requirements. One is a Rank 3 mission where you need to enter deep into Blazing Mountain Range and capture a Tier 3 fire-type Demonic Beast. But even though this mission's rich in rewards, the cultivation base of the Mercenaries who participate must be at least Advanced-Phase Sword Apprentice.\u201dThe man paused, then continued: \u201cThere's another Rank 2 mission which requires the party to enter the Blazing Mountain Range, hunt thirty Tier 2 Fire Spirit Rats and retrieve their Crystal Cores. The only requirement is that they're at or above the Initial-Phase Sword Apprentice Stage.\u201dLou Mu Yan thought about it\u2014she wanted to participate in the first mission as well. It was rumoured that the Flame Fruit was found only deep in the periphery of the Blazing Mountain Range, but her cultivation base wasn't high enough for the mission. She mused a bit, then asked: \u201cApart from the first task requiring a Great Sword Master, can anyone else participate?\u201dThe young man looked at Lou Mu Yan with a little surprise, then said after a pause: \u201cThey were also recruiting experienced Physicians, and they must be at or above Advanced-Phase Sword Novice.\u201d\u201cPhysician? How do they judge if one was eligible to participate or not?\u201d A glimmer of joy flashed in Lou Mu Yan's eyes.She was actually qualified for the position of a Physician. In her last life, when she reached a bottleneck at the Celestial Stage, she incarnated as a mortal and entered the secular world to comprehend the Path of the Heavens. There, she met a mortal genius doctor who taught her the Art of the Golden Needles, and naturally, she learnt all the medical skills. After tempering the void within herself, she didn't just discard her medical skills, but instead applied it to her own Golden Needles Method she created herself, and also improved a lot in Alchemy.\u201cThis time, the organiser is Ye Qing Han, the young heir of the Ye Clan. If you want to participate in this mission, you need to go to the Mercenary Union's second floor to accept a special personal assessment set by their clan at the Mercenary Union.\u201dLou Mu Yan nodded, took out ten silver coins and handed them over, saying: \u201cI want to register as a Mercenary, please register for me.\u201dThe man didn't ask too much, accepted the silver coins, and began registering for her. After finishing, he gave her a Rank 1 mercenary badge.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cThank you.\u201d Lou Mu Yan said with a smile after putting the badge away.The young man shook his head with a smile, then decided to remind her: \u201cIf Miss wants to go to the Blazing Mountain Range, I advise you, that place is listed as one of the Ten Treacherous Zones. There are Tier 1 to 6 Demonic Beasts in there, and maybe even stronger, and is extremely dangerous. If it's not necessary, it's best not to go.\u201d\u201cThank you for the caution.\u201d Lou Mu Yan smiled and nodded, then left the registration area, heading for the second floor.The area on the second floor was also very spacious, divided into many rooms, and each room had an evident purpose. Lou Mu Yan quickly found the place to enlist for the Rank 3 mission to the Blazing Mountain Range.After entering the room, she saw that there were already two young Mercenaries inside being questioned. She entered and asked an idle examiner\u2014an old man: \u201cMay I ask if you are still recruiting Physicians for this time's mission?\u201d\u201cYou want to enlist?\u201d The old man was around sixty years old with a pair of cloudy eyes that revealed a hidden brightness. He asked Lou Mu Yan faintly.Lou Mu Yan nodded: \u201cYes, I want to enlist.\u201d\u201cHave you done it before? Have you ever worked as a Physician at any medical clinic?\u201d\u201cI've never worked as a doctor, but I still have a certain degree of certainty in my medical skills. You can test me.\u201d A sense of confidence exuded from Lou Mu Yan as she replied with a smile.The old man scrutinised her, thought for a little bit, then said: \u201cCan you tell if I'm sick or not?\u201d\u201cCan I take your pulse?\u201d Lou Mu Yan asked.The old man nodded, stretched out a rather thin arm from beneath his sleeves and handed it over to her. Seeing this, Lou Mu Yan used her index and middle finger to touch the old man's artery.After a short while, Lou Mu Yan retracted her hand, her eyes filled with solemnity, and said to the old man: \u201cYou suffered an extremely serious internal injury ten years ago and it injured your organs. Your meridians are also blocked because of the sword aura.\u201dThe old man's expression changed from the initial inattentiveness to the current surprise. But then he furrowed his brows and said: \u201cAlthough it's not known by all that I was injured, you can still find out about it if you investigate thoroughly. This can't prove you have the qualifications to enlist.\u201dLou Mu Yan chuckled softly, then brought her lips beside the old man's ear, and said in a voice only the two of them could hear: \u201cNot only are your meridians blocked, but your cultivation also halted. There'll be a day every three months where your old ailments flare up and you'll feel pain to the bones, preferring to die than to live.\u201dThe old man's eyes widened and stared at the beautiful girl adorned with a large smile. The things she said were only known by the superiors of their clan and he believed it was impossible anyone in the clan would leak his secrets. Then this meant the girl did indeed have some talents. With a complicated look in his eyes, he asked: \u201cThen can you heal it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Lou Mu Yan said firmly.Upon hearing that, delightful surprise surfaced on the old man's face, but then he asked with gravity: \u201cDon't play around with this old man here, this sword wound was left by a powerful Sword Monarch Stage cultivator. In these ten years, I also visited numerous famous doctors, but not a single person could promise that they could heal it.\u201d\u201cWhat reason do I have to play with you? I really can heal your injury. From your pulse, I could deduce that tonight1\u00a0is precisely the night your wound will flare up. I can use my Art of the Golden Needles to treat you first so that you can avoid the pain you'll experience tonight. But it'll be quite troublesome to fully heal you.\u201d Lou Mu Yan said with a soft smile.There was a firm look in the old man's eyes. He was obsessed with the Path of the Sword for his entire life, and he suffered extremely when he could no longer advance. Still, he never gave up. Even though he never broke through, he still maintained his current cultivation at the Advanced-Phase Sword Spirit Stage. He might as well take the leap and consider it as 'treating a dead horse as if it's alive'2. He didn't think this little girl who's only at the Sword Apprentice Stage had the courage to play any tricks.\u201cSure. Putting aside avoiding the pain, as long as you can alleviate my pain even a little tonight, I'll trust you, and directly enlist you as the accompanying Physician for this mission.\u201d The old man replied.Lou Mu Yan nodded with a faint smile, not revealing her thoughts. After the two Mercenaries left, the old man asked the members of the clan to close the door, allowing Lou Mu Yan to apply her skills of the needle for him.1Author wrote 'tomorrow night' (\u660e\u665a) in the original but the next chapter actually suggests it was tonight.2he might as well give it a shot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 6: Golden Needles\u00a0TreatmentOnly the old man and three people from the Ye Clan remained in the room. A middle-aged man of the same generation as the old man watched Lou Mu Yan with eyes filled with doubt. He really couldn't understand why his eldest brother would believe in a young woman with such a low cultivation base.Then coldness surfaced in his eyes. She better not play with them, or else he wouldn't let her go, even if she as a beauty. He didn't want to see his eldest brother have hop then fall into despair again.Lou Mu Yan didn't care about the looks of the others. She took out a set of golden needles had made specifically for her, channelled a sliver of her Spiritual Energy into them, then pierced them through the old man's clothes, landing on several of his acupuncture points on his upper body.Even though her trash body couldn't absorb Spiritual Force after transmigrating here, she ended up figuring a way to accumulate a sliver of Spiritual Force and convert it into Spiritual Energy within her body. But it sure hurt to use it up after all that effort.She used her slight bit of Spiritual Energy with the golden needles to treat the old man. This time, she believed, when the old man's injury flared up, he wouldn't experience that excruciating pain anymore. She had confidence in her medical skills.After approximately an hour, Lou Mu Yan's face began to pale and sweat dripped from her face. It couldn't be helped\u2014maintaining the coordination between her Spiritual Energy and the golden needles was very energy consuming for this body.After another hour, Lou Mu Yan retrieved her needles with a face drained of blood. Her body was extremely weak, and she sat on the stool gasping for breath. It sure exhausted her. This trash constitution truly was troublesome.Meanwhile, the old man was the complete opposite of Lou Mu Yan. Not only was his face rosy, but he was also ecstatic. His meridians that had been blocked for ages finally loosened slightly. He felt a warm current pour into his dan'tian which had been damaged by the sword aura, nourishing it. Seeing Lou Mu Yan's pale face, he asked with concern: \u201cLittle Miss, are you ok?\u201dLou Mu Yan shook her head: \u201cIt took up a lot of my energy to treat you, but I'll be fine after I go home to rest for a night. How do you feel?\u201d\u201cI feel that the blocked meridians are a little looser now. There's also a slight connection between me and my damaged dan'tian. Will my meridians be completely clear after a few more sessions of your needles?\u201d The old man asked impatiently.Upon hearing the old man's words, the faces of the three people beside them brightened with joy, especially the middle-aged man, who was also a little ecstatic.Lou Mu Yan chuckled and said: \u201cIt wasn't that easy. You need to use some medicine together with the Art of the Golden Needles to be able to completely cure your chronic illness.\u201d Seeing the time of day outside, Lou Mu Yan said: \u201cI'll return now. Observe the results of my treatment tonight. I'll come back tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cVery well. This old man is looking forward to the results of Miss's treatment.\u201d The old man said with a rare smile.By the time Lou Mu Yan returned to the Academy, it was already the evening. After briefly eating some food, she knocked out on the bed. The Spiritual Energy within her already dried up and she was mentally and physically exhausted, so she could only temporarily supplement her stamina through sleeping. She simply couldn't wait to be able to refine that Marrow Cleansing Pill to improve this body's incompetent constitution, then successfully start to cultivate.The next morning, as Lou Mu Yan was about to leave, she bumped into Lou Mu Bai.\u201cBig brother, good morning!\u201d Lou Mu Yan greeted with a smile.A soft smile appeared on Lou Mu Bai's extraordinarily handsome face, \u201cWhere are you going so early?\u201d\u201cTo the Mercenary Union.\u201d Lou Mu Yan didn't want to conceal her whereabouts, and she didn't think she could conceal it even if she wanted to. With the Lou Clan's power and influence, it wasn't difficult to track her down in the Imperial Capital.Lou Mu Bai looked at her in surprise, and asked in befuddlement: \u201cWhat are you going to the Mercenary Union for?\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cI accepted a mission to the Blazing Mountain Range. I want to go see if I passed today.\u201d Lou Mu Yan replied with a smile.\u201cNonsense. Is going to the Blazing Mountain Range a game to you? Do you know how dangerous it is there?\u201d Lou Mu Bai's expression chilled and scolded her.Lou Mu Yan understood that Lou Mu Bai was being considerate of her, so she didn't mind his dissatisfaction. She stepped up to tug at Lou Mu Bai's sleeve and said mischievously: \u201cBig brother, I want to get rid of my reputation as trash as soon as possible, but the search for the Flame Fruit's hopeless, so I might as well initiate the attack instead of waiting passively.\u201d\u201cWho said the search for the Flame Fruit's hopeless? I came today specifically to tell you that I'll be heading to the Blazing Mountain Range in two days to help you find the Flame Fruit. You just stay in the Imperial Capital.\u201d A look of helplessness rose on Lou Mu Bai's handsome face.Lu Mu Yan shook her head, \u201cBig brother, if a fledgling wishes to soar through the vast sky, then they must first learn to fly by themselves. I want to become stronger, but I don't want to rely on you guys to grow. And this time, I'm going with the Ye Clan to the Blazing Mountain Range, so it's not too dangerous.\u201d She hugged Lou Mu Bai's arm and shook it again, continuing: \u201cPlease just let me go, I promise to come back safe and alive.\u201d\u201cYou\u2014 Aye! Yan'er, just why are you so stubborn?\u201d Lou Mu Bai sighed, looking at his little sister dotingly and said: \u201cThen I'll accompany you.\u201d\u201cBig brother, do you really not trust me? Relax, I promise you that I'll definitely come back safe and alive. They say 'if you don't die from a disaster, there's bound to be great fortune following'1. I didn't die last time, so there'll definitely be no problems this time. Please, just let me gain some training and experience myself.\u201d Lou Mu Yan rubbed her head on Lou Mu Bai's shoulder endearingly.\u201cYou're just so stubborn. Forget it, if you want to go, then go. But you must pay attention to your safety, got it?\u201d Lou Mu Bai compromised. His little sister was great in every way, all but her stubborn temper. She simply wouldn't stop until she hit herself against the south wall2.\u00a0 It wasn't something that he could change either and even if he did stop her, she'd still sneak away.After musing, Lou Mu Bai retrieved a yellow talisman from his interspatial ring and handed it to Lou Mu Yan, \u201cThis is a Thousand-li Teleportation Talisman. If you're in danger, use this talisman. It can teleport you a thousand-li3. No matter what, safety first. Even if you don't find the Flame Fruit it doesn't matter, prioritise your own life. Big brother will help you enquire about the Flame Fruit in the Imperial City during this time.\u201d\u201cThank you, big brother, you're the best.\u201d Lou Mu Yan took the talisman and put it away.In this world, Sword Masters could be divided into Alchemists, Smiths, Formation Masters, and Talisman Masters, to name a few. It was rather similar to the cultivators in her world. But these professions were scarce here and all of them were treated like treasures, vied for by various entities.\u201cHonestly, you\u2026 Just so wilful.\u201d Lou Mu Bai said dotingly as he tapped Lou Mu Yan's nose with his slender fingers.Lou Mu Yan finally tricked her big brother away and seeing that it was already rather late in the morning, she hurried towards the gate of the Academy. Yet who knew that she'd bump into Chi Yi Xuan and Yun Jin there.\u201cHm? Isn't this Mu Yan? Where are you going in such a hurry?\u201d Yun Jin asked with a smile as he blocked Lou Mu Yan's path as if he and she were familiar with each other.Lou Mu Yan rolled her eyes at him. This guy did it on purpose right? Why else would he block her path when she was leaving in a hurry?\u201cYeah! I'm in a hurry to leave, please move aside.\u201d Lu Mu Yan didn't even look at Chi Yi Xuan as she attempted to go around them.But her behaviour made Chi Yi Xuan feel exceptionally unpleasant. Was Lou Mu Yan playing hard to get? She even pretended to ignore him. He sure wanted to see what tricks she wanted to play.\u201cLou Mu Yan.\u201d Chi Yi Xuan called after Lou Mu Yan with a frown.1she'll be fine2very stubborn3unit of measurement. 1 li = ~500m = ~546 yards.

If you have something to say, say it, if you need to fart, then hurry up and fart.\u201d\u201cYou\u2014 Lou Mu Yan, do understand that you're a female, don't keep acting so unfeminine every day.\u201d Chi Yi Xuan didn't expect that Lou Mu Yan would be this impatient and rude to him. But why was it that when he looked at her simple and delicate appearance in her elegant purple dress, he suddenly remembered the times when they were younger\u2014that cute little girl who would chase after him calling 'big brother Xuan'. Since when did their relationship become like this?While Chi Yi Xuan was lost in his own world, Lou Mu Yan said sarcastically, without giving him any face: \u201cWho are you to me? What does it matter to you whether I behave and look feminine or not? There's something wrong with you.\u201d She didn't wait for Chi Yi Xuan to reply and quickly went around them.Chi Yi Xuan's eyes revealed faint surprise as he stood there, staring at the purple figure leaving their sight, with Yun Jin who looked as if he was watching an interesting play.Lou Mu Yan cursed Chi Yi Xuan inwardly as she hurried\u2014that damnable man, what was he doing acting so arrogant and self-righteous in front of her? He really thought he was someone important?Lou Mu Yan's feelings for Chi Yi Xuan were very complicated. Sometimes she would despise him, yet her heart would also throb for him from time to time. Although the original owner of this body made the decision, willingly, to completely dissipate, but that strong love for Chi Yi Xuan still remained within her body and was inherited by her. That's why every time she met Chi Yi Xuan, she needed to consciously suppress the strong feelings for him that was left behind. So she didn't want to see Chi Yi Xuan even more.\u201cYi Xuan, I don't think Lou Mu Yan's playing hard to get. Do you remember that rumoured divination?\u201d Yun Jin's eyes were filled with interest. He was currently very fascinated by Lou Mu Yan, so he hoped that she wouldn't disappoint him.Chi Yi Xuan nodded with a frown. Clans like theirs definitely knew about the divination from sixteen years ago1\u00a0made by the Divine Seer. It seemed that the divination came true. Lou Mu Yan really changed, and seeing the beautiful figure disappearing in their sight, he felt an inexplicable sense of loss. Then he shook his head and laughed in ridicule at himself.When Lou Mu Yan arrived at the Mercenary Union, the agreed time had already passed. She cursed Chi Yi Xuan and Yun Jin again inwardly. The moment she entered the door, she found a one of the juniors from the Ye Clan she met yesterday waiting in the lobby.\u201cMiss, you've finally arrived, the elders have been waiting upstairs for a while now.\u201d The young man said to Lou Mu Yan with a smile.Lou Mu Yan nodded: \u201cThank you for your trouble. Let's go.\u201dWhen she entered the room, she discovered that aside from the middle-aged man, there were two others. One of them was an old man that was around the same age as the elder from yesterday who was red-haired, red-bearded, had a slightly rotund body, and an amicable smile on his rosy face.There was also a younger man who wore a dark-patterned black robe, around twenty-years-old, with a handsome face. His facial features were as if they were sculpted, clear and defined, while his thin lips were slightly curled. Lou Mu Yan guessed that he was probably Ye Clan's Young Lord, Ye Qing Han.Ye Qing Han raised his sharp, phoenix-type eyes and also scrutinised Lou Mu Yan. She wore a simple and elegant purple dress, enveloping her graceful and attractive body. Her face without any powder was like a painting, and her facial features were exquisite, while her temperament appeared otherworldly\u2014she was indeed an interesting beauty.\u201cSorry, something happened so I'm late.\u201d Lou Mu Yan said with a smile to the old man from yesterday.A type of smile he hadn't revealed yesterday was now apparent on his face, and he politely cupped his hands. \u201cMiss is too polite. Thanks to Miss's treatment yesterday using the Art of the Golden Needles, the pain that occurred last night was indeed not as agonising as before. This old man truly admires Miss's medical skills.\u201d\u201cYou're welcome. I also did this just so I could join your team to the Blazing Mountain Range, so we were only obtaining what we each needed.\u201d Lou Mu Yan said bluntly. There was no need to hide anything in front of these intelligent and astute people.\u201cMiss Lou is indeed straightforward, seems like the rumours in the Imperial Capital about Miss is erroneous.\u201d Ye Qing Han's voice was mature and magnetic; very pleasant.Lou Mu Yan's smiled softly: \u201cSince you know that I'm Lou Mu Yan, then aren't you afraid that this trash here is playing with you?\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThe Ye Clan and her mother's Clan, the Ling Clan, were equals as they were two of the Ten Distinguished Spirit Sword Clans of this continent's Eastern Region. Even the Imperial Family didn't dare provoke these formidable clans. If a man blessed enough to be born into such clans like Ye Qing Han were to investigate her, it'd be as easy as blowing off dust.\u201cThe fact that you could control Old Lu's chronic illness from recurring proves that you indeed have some real abilities. Listening and believing is not my style, I only believe what I see. The process is not important, I'm more concerned with the results.\u201d Ye Qing Han raised an eyebrow as he said with a faint smile.He naturally knew of that divination about Lou Mu Yan. Divinations from the Divine Seer were never wrong, so towards Lou Mu Yan's change, because of the divination from fifteen years ago, even he felt it was only a matter of course. Naturally, why Lou Mu Yan knew the Art of the Golden Needles had to do with her own fortuitous encounters, so he wouldn't ask.\u201cThen do you mean that I'm qualified to participate in your mercenary mission?\u201d Lou Mu Yan raised an eyebrow.Ye Qing Han chuckled, \u201cNaturally. Our mission his time lacks a good Physician. We welcome your participation. I'm the leader of this mission, Ye Qing Han.\u201d\u201cWhen will we leave?\u201d Lou Mu Yan asked with a smile\u2014best to leave as soon as possible.Ye Qing Han glanced at Old Lu and the others and said: \u201cInitially we were planning to wait until the third day after Old Lao's chronic illness flares up, but now we decided to leave tomorrow. Is that fine with you?\u201d\u201cThat's fine, then it's settled.\u201d\u201cBy the way, I heard that Young Miss Lou can completely cure Old Lu's illness?\u201d Ye Qing Han's eyes revealed a look of expectation.Lou Mu Yan smiled and said, \u201cIndeed I can, but right now I can only control the illness. If you want me to completely cure it, you need to pair the needles with medicine. Three sessions should be enough to treat and fully recover.\u201d\u201cThen does Young Miss Lou have any conditions?\u201d Based on Lou Mu Yan's background, not to mention how pampered and cherished she was in the Lou Clan, she wouldn't risk going to the Blazing Mountain Range for the puny thirty thousand gold coin reward\u2014unless there were some secrets.Admiration flashed by in Lou Mu Yan's eyes\u2014this man was indeed smart. She also preferred straightforward transactions, \u201cI require the Flame Fruit. After you guys help me obtain the Flame Fruit at the Blazing Mountain Range, I can treat Old Lu. Of course, if I end up not finding the Flame Fruit, I can only say I'm unlucky, I'll still treat Old Lu. As for in exchange, we'll talk about it then. Well, either way, I won't make it difficult for you guys.\u201d\u201cVery well, I agree.\u201d A smile rose on Ye Qing Han's handsome face.Even though the Flame Fruit wasn't easy to obtain, if it could be used in exchange for Old Lu's health, then they still benefited from this. Not to mention, whether it was Lou Mu Yan's background or her very person, he felt that she was worth befriending. With such a beauty as company, their journey to the Blazing Mountain Range wouldn't be boring anymore either.\u201cThen tomorrow at dawn we'll gather here and leave.\u201d Ye Qing Han thought for a moment, then smiled and added: \u201cDon't be late tomorrow, Young Miss Lou.\u201dLou Mu Yan rolled her eyes at him\u2014what a petty man.\u201cI know, see you tomorrow. I still need to make some preparations, so I'll leave first.\u201d Lou Mu Yan said with slight annoyance.Ye Qing Han's deep black eyes were coloured with a smile, nodding: \u201cSee you then.\u201d1original says 16, could be typo from author.Note: Since it's the weekend, I'll publish 4 altogether over Saturday and SundayEdit: *cry* I re-read it just now and didn't think I spelt Ye Qing Han's name wrong so many times.

    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 8: The Blazing Mountain\u00a0RangeBefore sunrise the next morning, Lou Mu Yan went to the Mercenary Union. When she arrived, Ye Qing Han and the others were already there.\u201cYoung Miss Lou sure is punctual today.\u201d Ye Qing Han said with a smile, looking at the purple-clothed woman walking towards them.Lou Mu Yan arrived and shrugged her shoulders. \u201cI'm afraid that if I'm late, you guys wouldn't wait for me.\u201d\u201cYou're our Physician, even if we don't wait for others, we must wait for you.\u201d Ye Qing Han smiled.The two chatted a few more, then the team was ready to leave. They rode the Tier 1 Demonic Beast, Tailwind Horse, as such, they could decrease the time going back and forth.Ye Qing Han and his party consisted of six people. Aside from Ye Qing Han, Lou Mu Yan only recognised Old Lu. In addition to them, there was a young cold beauty and three other young men. Two of the young men appeared to be hired Mercenaries.The continent where Lou Mu Yan was located was named Tian'ling Continent, consisting of the four major regions\u2014the Eastern, Western, Southern and Northern Regions\u2014as well as countless large and small regions. Every region also had numerous large and small countries. Yan'zhou Country was considered a country with strength in the middle-low range within the major Eastern Region, and one of Tian'ling Continent's Ten Treacherous Zones was located right within its border\u2014the famous Blazing Mountain Range.It took five days to arrive at the Blazing Mountain Range from the Imperial Capital on the backs of the Tailwind Horses. During the five days, Lou Mu Yan and the others only stayed at an inn two of the nights, while they slept in the open for three of them.The Blazing Mountain Range was rich in cultivation resources, so even though it was considered one of the ten most dangerous places, there were still many Mercenaries and Sword Masters who came. Under normal circumstances, as long as one didn't traverse deep into the periphery, it wouldn't be too dangerous.Looking at the crimson mountain range still far away, she already felt waves upon waves of heat rushing at her. Lou Mu Yan tugged the reins of her Tailwind Horse and came to a halt.\u201cWe've arrived at the Blazing Mountain Range.\u201d Ye Qing Han looked to the distance with a smile.Because they rushed all the way here, Lou Mu Yan's Spiritual Energy had long dried out again, not to mention this body hadn't yet recovered well enough, so whenever they took time to rest, she immediately went to sleep to replenish her energy and didn't converse much with Ye Qing Han and his party.\u201cYou came to the Blazing Mountain Range to capture a Spirit Pet?\u201d Lou Mu Yan asked with a smile.There was also a profession called Spirit Beast Master in this world. These people had Mental Energy exceptionally stronger than the average Sword Master, could directly imprint a Seal in a Demonic Beast's Sea of Consciousness, then contract them as a Spirit Pet. As such, the Spirit Pet couldn't betray their master, could help their master during battle, and their own Tier could also increase.Ye Qing Han didn't conceal it either and nodded: \u201cMy little sister will be celebrating her fifteenth birthday soon. I want to capture a fire attribute Demonic Beast that's Tier 3 or above for her to contract as a Spirit Pet.\u201d\u201cWhy didn't you bring her?\u201d Lou Mu Yan wondered and asked.\u201cHer body's not in good health, that's why it's up to me.\u201d When mentioning his little sister, his gaze grew softer. Then, suddenly realising something, he turned to Lou Mu Yan, asking: \u201cYoung Miss Lou, you're very skilled in medicine, could you cure foetal poison?\u201d\u201cFoetal poison? So it's because she was poisoned in the womb that she's in bad health?\u201d Lou Mu Yan asked.Ye Qing Han sighed and nodded, saying: \u201cYes. She was poisoned when she was in the womb, and many Physicians said she couldn't live past twenty years old.\u201d\u201cThat's hard to say. It wasn't that foetal poison was incurable, but I still need to see your younger sister for the specifics to be able to make a decision.\u201d Lou Mu Yan was still confident in her medical skills. If she could successfully reach the Foundation Establishment Stage of her previous world, and use her Spiritual Energy paired with medicine, it wasn't difficult to treat that kind of foetal poison.Ye Qing Han's eyes lit up. Having hope was better than determining that it couldn't be cured. He said sincerely: \u201cThen can Young Miss Lou have a look at my little sister? Payment's not a problem.\u201d\u201cApologies, I don't have any time lately. After the Imperial Academy's annual competition is over, I'll take the time to come look.\u201d Lou Mu Yan's current objective was to first refine the Marrow Cleansing Pill and make a shocking reversal at the annual competition. Ye Qing Han's sister had been ill for many years already, so there wasn't a need to hurry. Not to mention she had no Spiritual Energy in her either, so the treatment wouldn't be very effective.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cThat sounds good. Regardless, I'll be troubling Young Miss Lou.\u201d Ye Qing Han also understood his little sister's condition. Even though she was weak and had cold symptoms, it wasn't as if she could be cured within a day or two.They travelled forward and only took a little more than an hour to arrive at the entrance to the Blazing Mountain Range. There were quite a few people who travelled here as well.\u201cDoes anyone of you want to purchase a map of the Blazing Fire Mountain?\u201d Seeing that the clothing on these few people weren't something commoners could wear, a young man in a light blue robe came up with a smile to sell his products, \u201cI also have the Blazing Mountain Range's Spiritual Herbs and Demonic Beasts records. I promise it'll be useful to you all.\u201d\u201cThe Blazing Mountain Range map?\u201d Ye Qing Han smiled, clearly disbelieving, as even Sword Monarchs wouldn't recklessly enter the central area of the Blazing Mountain Range, so how could this young man have any map?The blue-robed young man also knew what Ye Qing Han was thinking, so he smiled and said: \u201cI indeed don't have the map for the entire Blazing Mountain Range, but I do have the map for the entire periphery. This map was a summary of the information brought out by the Mercenaries that entered. My Master used ten years to finish this map. If it's not accurate, I don't want any money.\u201d\u201cPrice?\u201d Lou Mu Yan saw that the young boy's eyes were clear and clever and didn't look like a liar.\u201cOne hundred black-gold coins for one.\u201d The young boy quoted the price.On Chi'huo Continent1\u00a0there were three types of common currencies\u2014gold coins, black-gold coins, and purple-gold coins. It was at a ratio of one to one hundred\u2014that is, one black-gold coin was equal to one hundred gold coins, and one purple-gold coin was equal to one hundred black-gold coins.\u201cYour price is a bit expensive isn't it?\u201d A baby-faced young man beside Ye Qing Han said.The blue-clothed boy smiled and shook his head. \u201cMy price corresponds to the quality of the product. This map isn't some fake like the others. I've been here selling maps for more than a year, if it's not accurate, you can come back to find me.\u201d\u201cAre the Spiritual Herbs and Demonic Beast maps you have also of the periphery?\u201d Lou Mu Yan was more interested in them.\u201cI have everything on the periphery. I also have a map on the border between the periphery and the outer ring of the forest. But the price is more expensive, but I can also promise accuracy.\u201d The blue-clothed young man said with pride\u2014this was the crystallisation of his Master's ten years of work.Lou Mu Yan showed interest, and asked: \u201cThen are the locations of where the Spiritual Herbs grow and where the Demonic Beasts roam also accurate?\u201d\u201cThe booklet only records the approximate location and can't determine the exact position. If you want to search for them, you can only go according to the location. The areas of some Spiritual Herbs and Demonic Beasts couldn't be determined, after all, not many Mercenaries want to enter the border between the outer ring and the periphery.\u201d The blue-clothed young man thought for a bit before telling Lou Mu Yan the truth.\u201cThen give me a copy of each, how much altogether?\u201d Lou Mu Yan wasn't familiar with the Blazing Mountain Ranges, and though she followed Ye Qing Han and his party, this was a place full of danger. If they were separated, she had an extra guarantee.Seeing how generous the beautiful purple-clothed young girl was, the blue-clothed young man smiled merrily and took out four books from the cloth bag he was carrying on his back and said: \u201cThe map is one hundred black-gold coins, the Spiritual Herbs and Demonic Beasts map were one-hundred black-gold coins each, and the map of Spiritual Herbs and Demonic Beasts on the border was three hundred black-gold coins, so a total of five hundred black-gold coins2.\u201dLou Mu Yan's small vault was still rather rich, and Grandfather Lou even gifted her a precious interspatial ring after she regained consciousness. So she took out the entire five hundred black-gold coins without a care and handed it to the blue-clothed young man.\u201cKeep it safe.\u201d The young man handed the books to Lou Mu Yan, then cautioned with a smile: \u201cMiss, ensure you don't enter the outer ring, it's truly too dangerous there.\u201d\u201cI understand, thank you.\u201d Lou Mu Yan nodded. Her impression of the blue-clothed young man was pretty good.\u201cLet's go.\u201d After she bought the book, Lou Mu Yan said to Ye Qing Han and the others.Ye Qing Han naturally had information on the Blazing Mountain Range, but he didn't stop Lou Mu Yan from buying it. He smiled and nodded, then lead the rest into the Blazing Mountain Ranges.1author wrote Chi'huo Continent\u2026? (\u8d64\u706b\u5927\u9646) but there have never been any mentions of that continent. I'm pretty sure Tian'ling Continent (\u5929\u7075\u5927\u9646) is the overall world they're in while Chi'huo Continent specifically refers to the one she's on. Maybe native speakers understand the difference despite the same usage of the word '\u5927\u9646'. Or the author made a mistake (but she mentioned it again in a later chapter), or I made a mistake. I'll come back to fix it if I realise I need to while translating.2pretty sure I translated it correctly, but the author wrote the price wrong.

    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 9: The Female Servant Seeks\u00a0TroubleThey rode their Tailwind Horses1\u00a0through the entrance, and they didn't travel too far before arriving at the foot of the mountain range. The mountain range was covered in dense trees spreading across the area, and there were even circles of thorn bushes before them. They could only abandon their horses and enter.\u201cThe Tailwind Horses could only come here. We need to continue by foot.\u201d Ye Qing Han dismounted the horses, moving elegantly.Lou Mu Yan nodded and also dismounted, then she heard Ye Qing Han blow a whistle. Following, the seven Tailwind Horses vanished from their view.\u201cThese Tailwind Horses are quite intelligent, are they all your Spirit Pets?\u201d Lou Mu Yan didn't know a lot about the Spirit Beast Masters of this continent. She once obtained a Manual from the Beast Tamers Sect\u2014she wondered if it worked or not for this world's Demonic Beasts.Ye Qing Han smiled and explained: \u201cTier 1 Demonic Beasts like the Tailwind Horses aren't valuable enough to become Spirit Pets. We, Spirit Beast Masters, use the strength of our Mental Energy to determine the Spirit Pets we contract. So a Spirit Beast Master at the Spirit Novice Tier could only contract one Spirit Pet, so on and so forth. But one could only contract a maximum of ten Spirit Pets, so Spirit Beast Masters won't randomly contract a Demonic Beast to avoid wasting the quota.\u201d\u201cThat is to say, Spirit Beast Master clans like yours have other ways of taming Tier 1 Demonic Beasts like the Tailwind Horse without a contract.\u201d After hearing Ye Qing Han's explanation, Lou Mu Yan had a general idea.\u201cIndeed.\u201d Ye Qing Han's eyes revealed some admiration towards her. Whoever said Lou Mu Yan was a good-for-nothing really were blind\u2014making one point was enough for her to understand the rest, and she was also smart and charming. Such a woman was very attractive.\u201cAre Tailwind Horses hard to train?\u201d Before Lou Mu Yan could fly on a sword, she wanted to obtain one for travel.Seeing Lou Mu Yan's bright eyes, Ye Qing Han also guessed a little bit of what she was thinking, so he promised with a smile: \u201cIt's not difficult to train, but only Spirit Beast Master clans have special training methods. If you like, I could gift you one. You can pick one out of any of the seven horses just now.\u201d\u201cSure! Then I want the one I rode earlier.\u201d Lou Mu Yan was very satisfied with how Ye Qing Han caught on\u2014this man had a good temper.With a gentle smile on his lips, he said: No problems.\u201d Then he took out a whistle from his interspatial ring and handed it to her, saying: \u201cThis is a whistle to control the Tailwind Horses, you can use this to control it.\u201d After that, he told Lou Mu Yan the control method.After Lou Mu Yan learnt it, she waved the whistle in her hand, smiled and said: Thanks!\u201dSeeing that their Young Lord and the Imperial Capital's infamous 'Young Miss Trash' were talking so harmoniously, the beautiful woman who followed behind them felt unpleasant. If it were any other person, perhaps she wouldn't feel this uncomfortable, but who was that trash Lou Mu Yan to be worthy to speak to a person like their Young Lord.Lou Mu Yan's Mental Energy was very strong, so she naturally discovered the dislike of the icy woman behind them. She curled her lips in ridicule\u2014she really disliked women who pretended to be aloof and virtuous.Old Lu was rather polite to Lou Mu Yan all the way, and the reason he came this time was because he entered the periphery of the Blazing Mountain Range ten years ago, so he was familiar with this place.\u201cYoung Miss Lou, let's leave after a break.\u201d Ye Qing Han said considerately with a smile as he saw Lou Mu Yan's face growing pale, and a layer of sweat was dripping from her forehead.Lou Mu Yan felt truly helpless about the condition of her body. She didn't have any Spiritual Energy within her, so she could only rely on an ice jade, that Lou Mu Bai gave her before she left, to resist the heat. But it was truly overwhelming to travel in this high-temperature region.\u201cYeah, sorry, I'm slowing down your pace.\u201d Lou Mu Yan's beautiful little face displayed an apologetic smile\u2014she would try to adapt to this place.\u201cNo worries.\u201d Ye Qing Han smiled and told the others to rest in place.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThe icy woman that came with them was called Ye Jing, a female servant to Ye Qing Han. Because she had good talent, she received training from the Ye Clan, and was currently a Middle-Phase Great Sword Master.\u201cKnowing you would drag people down and yet you still came, who knows what you're really thinking, trash.\u201d Seeing that the Young Lord was so considerate of and amiable to Lou Mu Yan, a trash, Ye Jing couldn't help but ridicule.Back when she was in the Immortal Cultivation World, very few people dared to offend Lou Mu Yan, not to mention ridicule. Yet in this life, because she was a trash with Terminal Meridians2, she was being mocked and ridiculed everywhere she went. It really fitted that saying: 'a tiger leaves its forest, ends up in the plains, and gets bullied by a dog'.\u201cYour master hasn't even said anything, what's a dog like you barking about.\u201d Lou Mu Yan never had a tolerant temperament. In her life, she had never offered her right cheek over to be slapped after her left cheek was.Lou Mu Yan could naturally see that Ye Qing Han and Old Lu didn't actually like this female servant, and with her own identity and background, she wasn't afraid of offending a female servant of the Ye Clan.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ye Jing's face darkened. She didn't expect that Lou Mu Yan, a trash, would say something like that to her, so she pulled out her sword and wanted to stab her.\u201cStop it. Young Miss Lou is the Physician I invited. Ye Jing, you are too presumptuous.\u201d Ye Qing Han looked at Ye Jing coldly.This female servant was becoming more and more impudent. In the Clan she exploited her status as his personal servant to bully others, and even secretly sought profit for her family using questionable means. He hadn't even settled those with her, and now she even blatantly ridiculed the person he invited directly in front of him. It seemed that his usual behaviour was too kind, was this egoistical servant going to take advantage of her master now?\u201cJing Jing doesn't dare.\u201d Ye Jing bit her lower lip and retracted her sword, but she didn't conceal her indignant look.After becoming the Young Lord's personal servant, she obviously would become his concubine in the future, so she naturally saw Ye Qing Han as hers. She definitely wouldn't allow a trash like Lou Mu Yan to get involved.There was a hidden coldness in Ye Qing Han's eyes. He originally wanted to leave Ye Jing to interfere with his second uncle's intel, but it appeared that he couldn't keep her any longer.Lou Mu Yan naturally caught the coldness in Ye Qing Han's eyes. She curled her lips into a smile\u2014this servant sure felt too self-important. She didn't even realise at all that her master didn't have feelings for her, not to mention he even hated her. But Ye Qing Han sure was more than what he appeared.\u201cLet's go.\u201d Lou Mu Yan rested for a while and stood up while rubbing her slightly numb feet. She didn't want to drag down the progress of Ye Qing Han's group.When Ye Qing Han saw Lou Mu Yan endure her discomfort and continue with a firm heart, his impression of her improved another layer once more\u2014this woman would definitely be extraordinary in the future.The deeper they walked, the fewer Mercenaries or adventurous Sword Masters they met. Lou Mu Yan took out a book bought from the blue-clothed young boy, observed the map, and discovered that the path they took was indeed the same route as the one on the map.She took out the book on Spiritual Herbs and flipped through it. The book recorded that the Flame Fruit was only found in the border between the periphery and the outer ring. Her brows knitted subconsciously.\u201cThe Demonic Beasts we're looking for are also at the borders, so we can help you find the Flame Fruit.\u201d Seeing Lou Mu Yan frown, expression serious, Ye Qing Han smiled and soothed her.Seeing Ye Qing Han's sincerity, Lou Mu Yan nodded: \u201cOk. Hopefully we can all reap something from this trip.\u201d1Instead of \u987a\u98ce\u9a6c, the author changed it to \u8e0f\u98ce\u9a6c. They basically mean similar things so I'm leaving the translation.2For returning readers, I decided to give a name to Lou Mu Yan's constitution\u2014in fact, it was given a name in the novel, except I didn't know how to translate it. In the novel it's \u7edd\u8109\u4f53\u8d28 ('Terminal Meridian constitution' is the translation now). And the person with that constitution was called \u7edd\u8109\u8005 (aka. Person with Terminal Meridians). '\u7edd\u8109' was what was difficult for me to translate, and I only thought of a good translation for it now. Well, good enough at least, I hope haha.

    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 10: Flame\u00a0FruitThe group of people didn't encounter any high-Tier Demonic Beasts on their way while they avoided the low-Tier Demonic Beasts with Ye Qing Han's warnings.Around half a day later, they arrived at the periphery area of the Blazing Mountain Range.Before them, there was a dense forest, and after walking only for a short while, they heard the sounds of a battle. Ye Qing Han and his party immediately started being vigilant.\u201cYoung Lord, should we go over?\u201d Old Lu looked to the distance and asked Ye Qing Han cautiously.Ye Qing Han's eyes were deep and serene, mused for a bit, then said: \u201cGo. Let's go and have a look.\u201dAt the drop of his word, they immediately sped up towards the direction of the fight. Past the dense forest was a clearing and there were currently three people surrounded by a group of Tier 2 and 3 Fur Crimson Boar Demonic Beasts. On the ground there laid two bloodied people, weak with heavy injuries.\u201cWe trouble you to please save us. We promise a rich gift of gratitude.\u201d A burly man amongst the group yelled for help upon seeing Ye Qing Han and the others.Seeing this, Ye Qing Han turned to the four people on the side: \u201cYou guys go.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Lord.\u201dThe three men and one woman flew directly towards the surrounded, drew their swords and fought with the Fur Crimson Boars. Using only an incense stick of time1, they successfully rescued the men from more than ten Fur Crimson Boars.Throughout the battle, Lou Mu Yan leaned against a tree with folded arms. Right now, she couldn't participate in such battles at all. Even though the fighting spirit within her was aroused, she was still burdened by her Terminal Meridians trash constitution, so she could only watch. She discovered that Ye Qing Han's subordinates had good combat power, probably because they often honed their fighting skills at close quarters.\u201cThank you for your help. I have five Tier 3 Demonic Beast Cores here, which are the most expensive items on us.\u201d The big man took out five Crystal Cores from his pocket and handed it to Ye Qing Han to express his gratitude for saving their lives.Ye Qing Han didn't reach for the Demonic Beast Cores, and said instead: \u201cNo need, it was just on the way.\u201d It wasn't easy for these Mercenaries to come to the Blazing Mountain Range for their missions, and even if he took these Tier 3 Demonic Beast Cores, it wasn't useful to him.\u201cThen thank you very much. If in the future you require our help, please let us know. My name is Jiang Dong, and they are members of my small Mercenary Party.\u201d Jiang Dong placed the slightly bloodied Crystal Cores back into his pockets. He also knew that these people who wore expensive clothes wouldn't care for his Crystal Cores, but he was still very grateful to them for their life-saving grace.\u201cWhy were you guys being surrounded by Fur Crimson Boars?\u201d Based on what he knew, Fur Crimson Boars moved in groups. These types of Demonic Beasts2\u00a0usually wouldn't leave their territory easily. He was rather curious\u2014how did this group of Mercenaries offend this group of boars?Jiang Dong and the other two squatted and helped lift the two injured from the ground, fed them a medicinal pill, then raised their heads and explained: \u201cWe were chasing after a Tier 3 Striped Leopard and accidentally entered the edge of the outer ring, but we also discovered a Flame Fruit. Originally we wanted to pick it, yet who knew that a Tier 4 Fur Crimson Boar King would be guarding it and commanded this group of Tier 2 and 3 Fur Crimson Boars to besiege and kill us. Luckily we ran fast, then encountered Sir, otherwise we would've really died in the hands of these Demonic Beasts.\u201dLou Mu Yan's eyes lit up. She sought for it fruitlessly until her iron shoes were broken, only to find it by chance without even looking3\u2014she hadn't even been in the Blazing Mountain Range for long and she already received news of the Flame Fruit. \u201cWhat you found was really the Flame Fruit?\u201d\u201cYes, and based on its appearance, it should've just bore fruit. It still had a bit of green, and the Fur Crimson Boar King should be waiting for it to mature, otherwise it would've already eaten it.\u201d Jiang Dong answered honestly with his guess.\u201cWhere is the location of that Flame Fruit you discovered?\u201d Lou Mu Yan was delighted\u2014as long as she could find the Flame Fruit, she could refine the Marrow Cleansing Pill and improve her Terminal Meridian constitution.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksJiang Dong mused, then pointed to a direction in the southeast and said: \u201cWe discovered it there, it's about an hour away.\u201d\u201cYoung Lord Ye, I'm going to find that Flame Fruit, are you going to come with me or stay here to wait for me?\u201d Lou Mu Yan suppressed the emotions in her eyes and smiled softly as she asked Ye Qing Han.Ye Qing Han's eyes revealed slight surprise\u2014even if they already cleaned up this group of Fur Crimson Boars, but with Lou Mu Yan as a low-level Sword Master, how could her abilities rival a Tier 4 Fur Crimson Boar King and compete for the Flame Fruit? But seeing that Lou Mu Yan's eyes were clear and without calculations, it appeared that regardless of whether they went with her or not, it wouldn't make a huge difference. Curiosity rose in his heart with the desire to know just how she'd deal with the Fur Crimson Boar King.\u201cWe'll go with you.\u201dLou Mu Yan nodded. She didn't care if Ye Qing Han and his party followed or not. Although she was unable to confront Tier 4 Demonic Beasts directly, she had other life-saving trump cards, so she didn't need to fear the Fur Crimson Boar King at all. Otherwise she wouldn't dare come to such a dangerous place like the Blazing Mountain Range to search for the Flame Fruit.Ye Jing sneered disdainfully\u2014what did she mean by go together or stay here? She was probably thinking of grasping onto their Young Lord for help either way. She felt unpleasant again. Who knew what their Young Lord saw in her to actually acknowledge and admire this trash to the point of helping her obtain the Flame Fruit? She didn't want to tag along at all.\u201cIf you don't want to follow, then don't.\u201d Lou Mu Yan naturally heard the sneer of the disgusting woman who despised and belittled her. Her cold gaze swept to Ye Jing, then turned to Jiang Dong and said, 'thank you!', before rushing over to the direction he pointed.Ye Jing flushed red with anger\u2014this trash dared to speak to her like this. But when she was about to start cursing, Ye Qing Han cast a cold glance at her, filled with warning, so she just stomped her foot, unwilling. She cursed Lou Mu Yan inwardly and decided that she'd definitely teach the trash a lesson in the future.Ye Qing Han looked at the beautiful silhouette in front of him, and interest rose in his eyes. His lips curled up and he quickly followed.After travelling for around an hour, Lou Mu Yan felt wave after wave of heat coming from ahead that spread to her surroundings. A hint of joy rose in her crystal-clear eyes\u2014the Flame Fruit. This was the heat emitted by the Flame Fruit.She quickened her pace, and in a few moments, she saw a jewel-like crystal-clear red plant growing beside a grey boulder. Hanging from it were three delicate red fruits.Maybe it was because of Jiang Dong's unintentional arrival, the Fur Crimson Boar King was now alert. It was lying lazily on the boulder for a rest, but he always kept his attention on the bright red plant.\u201cYou guys wait here for me.\u201d Lou Mu Yan whispered to Ye Qing Han and his group after she assessed the Fur Crimson Boar King's strength.Ye Qing Han raised his eyebrows and frowned slightly, with a look of disapproval in his eyes. He whispered: \u201cDon't belittle this Tier 4 Fur Crimson Boar, its defence and attack are both very strong, you're not its opponent.\u201d\u201cRelax, I know I can handle it.\u201d Lou Mu Yan waved her hand. Even though she didn't have the confidence to kill this Boar King, she at least had enough confidence to obtain the Flame Plant.Ye Qing Han saw that Lou Mu Yan emitted a light of confidence and wasn't joking around, so he nodded and said: \u201cBe careful. If there's any danger, I'll take action.\u201d\u201cSure. Then I'm going.\u201d1approximately half an hour2author wrote '\u9b54\u517d' which is used sometimes translated interchangeably or translated into 'Magical Beasts'.

    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 11: Successfully\u00a0ObtainedAfter Lou Mu Yan finished speaking to Ye Qing Han, she used her Flash Steps and headed directly towards the Fur Crimson Boar King.Flash Step was a Manual that she obtained back in the Immortal Cultivation World. After successfully learning its entirety, one's figure would be as ethereal and invisible as the wind, as well as being extremely flexible and changeable. The speed was extremely fast, and whether it was escaping or changing positions during battle, it was definitely one of the best means to save one's life.Meanwhile, the Fur Crimson Boar King that was lying on the huge grey boulder also discovered the purple shadow that was rapidly drifting over. Its eyes grew bloodshot, and it puffed two streams of hot air through its nose. It immediately stood up, its hind legs kicked the huge rock behind him, then it shot itself out like a missile, heading straight towards Lou Mu Yan.Right when the Fur Crimson Boar King was near her, slyness flashed in Lou Mu Yan's eyes. She reached out her left hand, swung it and a ball of paper immediately hit the Fur Crimson Boar King's nose. The paper scattered and a bit of white power spread through the wind, entering the boar's nostrils.The Fur Crimson Boar King suddenly froze as if having a stroke and collapsed to the ground. Lou Mu Yan's lips rose in a smirk and utilised Flash Step to its limit.She swiftly arrived by the large grey boulder and without hesitation, she uprooted the Flame Plant and placed it directly into her interspatial ring.Meanwhile, the fact that she only took a few breaths of time to obtain the Flame Plant stunned Ye Qing Han and his party who remained not far away. What sort of footwork was this? How could one's speed be so fast that their figure appeared like a ghostly silhouette?And what was that white powder? It could actually make a Tier 4 Fur Crimson Boar King collapse to the ground\u2014it sure enlightened them. They stared at the paper that the white powder was originally wrapped within, their eyes filled with shock, but also glistened with ideas.Although the Fur Crimson Boar King fell to the ground due to Lou Mu Yan's powder, but its eyes were fixed on the purple figure. Seeing that the Flame Fruit that it guarded for so many years was lost to the hands of a damn human, its eyes were filled with fury, and it kept roaring.The effect of the powder didn't last long, so the moment Lou Mu Yan retrieved the Flame Plant, the moment the Fur Crimson Boar King could move. It immediately stood up, charged at Lou Mu Yan furiously with it eyes as wide was copper bells, and its entire body filled with rage as if it could only be vented after tearing her to pieces.Lou Mu Yan turned around and her gaze chilled. She could actually use Mental Energy to directly attack the Fur Crimson Boar King's brain and let it collapse, but she didn't want to expose all her trump cards in front of Ye Qing Han and his party. So she could only use Flash Step to its maximum to dodge the Fur Crimson Boar King's attacks.Lou Mu Yan avoiding every attack from the Fur Crimson Boar King truly infuriated it\u2014this damned human was so cunning. It must tear her into pieces.Although Lou Mu Yan could easily avoid the Fur Crimson Boar King's attack using her Flash Step, but this boar's power was essentially a Tier 4 Demonic Beast equivalent to a Sword Spirit Stage expert. And her physical strength, due to her Terminal Meridians constitution that couldn't absorb any Spiritual Force, could hardly compare to a Sword Master. Soon, her forehead covered in a thin layer of sweat.She harumphed coldly, then fled directly into the dense woods. Even if she couldn't kill it, it was still easy to escape.Ye Qing Han naturally understood that Lou Mu Yan's physical strength was almost overdrawn, so seeing that she was escaping, he couldn't resist, tapped his foot, and flew out. He drew out his prized sword and swung at the Fur Crimson Boar King with a sword attack that was filled with Elemental Energy.One could only see a flash of golden light from the sword that formed an arc in the air and instantly entered the Fur Crimson Boar King's body.[PENG!] The Fur Crimson Boar King was blasted more than ten metres away after being hit directly by Ye Qing Han's sword aura. Following, blood dripped from its nostrils and eyes, and after twitching a few times on the ground, it perished.Lou Mu Yan stopped, turned around and returned to Ye Qing Han's side, saying: \u201cThank you!\u201dAlthough she could escape, or even kill the Fur Crimson Boar King with her Mental Energy without Ye Qing Han's help, but since Ye Qing Han did intervene, it saved her a lot of effort and she also didn't need to expose her trump cards. She had a good impression of this man.\u201cYou can still get rid of it even if I didn't interfere.\u201d Ye Qing Han's handsome face revealed a small smile. Along the way here, Lou Mu Yan constantly surprised him, so he also believed that she still had more abilities yet to reveal.\u201cYou saved me quite some effort by intervening.\u201d \u00a0Lou Mu Yan shrugged, and her lips curled up: \u201cYou're quite strong.\u201d\u201cAlthough this Fur Crimson Boar King was of the same Stage as me, but it only just became a Tier 4 Demonic Beast not long ago, so my attack could easily kill it.\u201d Ye Qing Han explained modestly.Lou Mu Yan nodded and smiled: \u201cThe strength of a Peak-Phase Sword Spirit. Even amongst same-stage peers, you must be a tough opponent.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksYe Qing Han wasn't just at the Sword Spirit Stage, but he was also a Spirit Beast Master.Seeing that he was wearing a Spirit Pet Bangle, she believed that there must be a Spirit Pet inside. And as a disciple raised and trained by a large clan, who didn't have their own trump cards? She was certain that even if the Fur Crimson Boar King was at Peak-Phase Tier 4 strength, it still wouldn't be Ye Qing Han's opponent.Ye Qing Han smiled softly in tacit recognition of her words, gave a look to one of his subordinates. The subordinate understood to open up the Fur Crimson Boar King, retrieve its Crystal Core and hand it to Ye Qing Han to put in his interspatial ring.Interspatial rings were scarce in Yan'zhou Country, and only people with a certain identity, status and power could own and use one. The interspatial ring worn by Lou Mu Yan was a gift from her grandfather for her fifteenth birthday.Low-level Sword Masters without any background, such as Mercenaries like Jiang Dong, could never afford interspatial rings.They would all buy a special type of inexpensive interspatial bag. It was fairly easy to carry around, but only had one cubic metre of space and wasn't bound to anyone. Whoever obtained it could easily open it and use it, and their toughness couldn't compare to interspatial rings.\u201cYoung Lord Ye, are we going to capture some fire-type Demonic Beasts now?\u201d Lou Mu Yan already achieved her goal, so she was in a rather good mood and asked: \u201cDo you have a goal?\u201d\u201cAre we considered friends now after travelling together?\u201d Ye Qing Han avoided her question, lifted his eyes to look at Lou Mu Yan and asked.Lou Mu Yan was stunned for a moment, then a lovely smile appeared on her beautiful little face: \u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cThen let's not be so distant, you can just call me Qing Han or Brother Ye from now on.\u201d Ye Qing Han's gaze was gentle with a smile on his face.\u201cThen Qing Han, you can just call me by my name or Mu Yan.\u201d Lou Mu Yan nodded without any pretence.There was a layer of faint anger in Ye Jing's eyes\u2014wasn't their Young Lord being too nice to this trash? Even if this trash did look pretty good, but she still couldn't match a person as glorious as their Young Lord.Then she narrowed her eyes, and a vicious thought crossed her mind.She must get rid of Lou Mu Yan in the Blazing Mountain Range and mustn't let their Young Lord develop any feelings for her, otherwise with that trash's identity, if she married their Young Lord, she'd be his official wife. By then, Lou Mu Yan would be suppressing her.Lou Mu Yan's Mental Energy was very strong, so she wouldn't be noticed even if she used it. She caught onto the flash of viciousness in Ye Jing's eyes.She sneered within\u2014if this stupid woman took the initiative to come at her, then she'd let her know how to write the word 'regret'.\u201cMu Yan, the goal of our trip is the Peak-Phase Tier 4 Demonic Beast, the Flame Unicorn Beast, that resides in the outer ring of the Blazing Mountain Range.\u201dYe Qing Han didn't conceal it and continued: \u201cThe Flame Unicorn Beast is unique and very talented, so you can't compare its power to the Fur Crimson Boar King's. At Tier 4, its combat power's comparable to a Tier 5. We've already discovered where its lair is, so when we arrive, you must be careful.\u201d\u201cSure, then let's go.\u201d Lou Mu Yan nodded in response. She had seen the introduction of the Flame Unicorn Beast in the Demonic Beast records book in the Imperial Academy, so she had a general idea.Afterwards, they headed towards the outer ring of the Blazing Mountain Range.Because Ye Qing Han had the precise location of the Flame Unicorn Beast's lair, they avoided a lot of detours and arrived in the neighbourhood of its lair early the next morning.Note: Man I really don't want to write 'Fur Crimson Boar King' again\u2026 I wrote it so many times HAHAHANote: Alright, back to normal updates, 1 a day at 6pm AEST (as long as the automatic publishing system works).

A small and remote path led towards it.The volcano was surrounded by a wasteland and there wasn't a single living organism around. This also proved that the Flame Unicorn Beast was the king of this area and other Demonic Beasts didn't dare break into its territory.Ye Qing Han's face revealed a rare look of caution and gravity, then turned to the people and commanded: \u201cWhen Old Lu and I deal with the beast, you three support us from the side. If any of you are wounded, go to Lou Mu Yan for treatment.\u201cYes, Young Lord.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cRight, Mu Yan, do you still have the powder you used against the Fur Crimson Boar King?\u201d Ye Qing Han asked Lou Mu Yan expectantly.Lou Mu Yan took out a small paper pack and handed it over: \u201cThis drug can freeze Tier 4 Demonic Beasts for around the time for eight or nine breaths, but against a Demonic Beast with Tier 5 strength, it probably could only last three breaths. Know what you're doing.\u201d\u201cThree breaths is good.\u201d Ye Qing Han took the small paper pack with a soft smile\u2014this powdered drug was very useful.Then he waved his hand and led them into the cave cautiously.The walls around the cave and the path they took were all dark red and waves of heat rushed towards them from all around. Everyone used their Elemental Energy to create a barrier and protect their body, guarding them from the invasion of heat.However Lou Mu Yan could only walk arduously through the passage herself, her small face glowing red, and her clothes soaked in sweat.But she didn't make a sound, following the rest closely.Ye Qing Han glanced back at Lou Mu Yan who hung at the end of the party. Without Elemental Energy to isolate the heat wave, using only the body of a normal human, she could actually clench her teeth and persevere? The toughness of this woman surprised him greatly.A quarter of an hour later, they finally arrived at a narrow, deep, dark red path.Entering their eyes was a large, open space and at the centre of the open space laid a deep crimson Demonic Beast that was at least a metre tall and three metres long. Its body was covered in red scales and there was a thick, sharp horn protruding from its head. With only one look, it was clear that it had extremely high defence.The Flame Unicorn Beast noticed them the moment they stepped into its cave. It opened its eyes and the pair of eyes as large as copper bells revealed a look of disdain.Only when Demonic Beasts reached Tier 4 could they gain intelligence, but this Demonic Beast belonged to a superior species, therefore they obtained intelligence from the moment they could cultivate. Naturally, they could perceive the strength of the incoming people.The Flame Unicorn Beast found that two of the humans were of the same tier as him, but its combat power was comparable to the Sword King Stage cultivator, and the rest were like ants, so it belittled these humans that dared to break into his territory.[ROAR!!] The Flame Unicorn Beast stood up lazily and pressured them with its roars.Aside from Ye Qing Han, Old Lu and Lou Mu Yan, the other three covered their ears in agony. Lou Mu Yan was fine because her Mental Energy was strong, so this sort of sound couldn't affect her, while Ye Qing Han and Old Lu relied on their pure strength.\u201cGo.\u201d Ye Qing Han gave Old Lu a look and the two of them leapt over and landed on the open space.The Flame Unicorn Beast sprayed two streams of hot air from its nose, a sign of its growing fury. It must tear these arrogant humans, who dared to disturb its sleep, into pieces.Ye Qing Han also noticed that the pressure from the Flame Unicorn Beast continued to increase. With a thought, a little bit of Mental Energy slithered into the Spirit Pet Bangle around his wrist.[ROAR!!] A roar with the same pressure echoed in the cave.At the drop of the roar, a pure white tiger appeared on the open space, its entire body exuding the pressure of a Peak-Phase Tier 4 Demonic Beast. The '\u738b'1\u00a0character on its forehead even contained a trace of a mysterious, fluctuating Elemental Energy.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksLou Mu Yan stared at the mighty white tiger with slight surprise\u2014a mutated Snow Tiger King. Ye Qing Han's Spirit Pet wasn't inferior to the Flame Unicorn Beast species by much.The environment here was more favourable for the Flame Unicorn Beast, but being surrounded by two people and one beast, there wasn't any suspense to the battle. The Flame Unicorn Beast would lose as long as no accidents occurred.[ROAR ROAR!!][ROAR!!]When the two powerful Demonic Beasts met, neither wanted to be suppressed by the other, so they roared and pounced at each other. Ye Qing Han also wanted to observe his Spirit Pet's prowess, so he didn't do anything for the time being.With the most primitive violence, the two Demonic Beasts attacked and tore away at each other, though the Flame Unicorn Beast clearly had the advantage. Its defence was much stronger than the Snow Tiger King, plus it could utilise the energy from the volcano, so it quickly overwhelmed the Snow Tiger King and bit down on its neck.Ye Qing Han frowned\u2014this Snow Tiger King was subdued by him when it was still a cub, so its barbarity lacked a little compared to the Flame Unicorn Beast. Not to mention it lacked experience in fighting, so it was being suppressed.With his own Spirit Pet's neck firmly bitten by the Flame Unicorn Beast, blood spurted from the area and dyed its white coat crimson. Ye Qing Han's eyes grew cold, drew his sword and wielded it against the Flame Unicorn Beast.A sword aura with powerful Elemental Energy fell directly on the Flame Unicorn Beast, but didn't penetrate its body, only leaving a small wound where a few red scales fell.Meanwhile Lou Mu Yan quickly headed towards the Snow Tiger King, took out a porcelain bottle, and poured the green liquid with the fragrance of medicine onto its wound. The injury immediately stopped bleeding.[ROAR!!] The Flame Unicorn Beast felt pain on its back, turned around in fury and leapt at Ye Qing Han.Ye Qing Han's lips curled up, avoided the attack from the Flame Unicorn Beast, while a small paper pack accurately fell on the Flame Unicorn Beast's nose. The white powder instantly spread and entered its nostrils.The Flame Unicorn Beast fell onto the ground, frozen in its state of attack, and Ye Qing Han shouted: \u201cBreak!\u201dAt that moment, a golden sword aura burst from the prized sword he held and slashed fiercely down on the Flame Unicorn's body. Old Lu took the opportunity to pierce through the area between its limb and the body, where its defence was the weakest.The eyes of the Flame Unicorn Beast were bloodshot and it could only feel the pain of its scales torn from numerous parts of its body. But then it felt that it could finally move.It stood up furiously and roared again, and the roars encompassed its entire Elemental Energy. [ROAR!!]\u201cNot good!\u201d Lou Mu Yan felt the entire cave tremble at the roar of the Flame Unicorn Beast and stones fell. It was about to collapse.\u201cGet out quickly.\u201d Ye Qing Han yelled at Lou Mu Yan and three of his subordinates, then flashed beside the Flame Unicorn Beast with Old Lu, utilising his sword skill with the intention of severely wounding it.What the Snow Tiger King lacked was only experience, so even though its defence wasn't as strong as the Flame Unicorn Beast, the latter's bite still wouldn't have been able to break its neck. Although injured somewhat, with Lou Mu Yan's medicine, the pain faded as well.It glared and kicked its hind legs, pouncing at the Flame Unicorn Beast.[ROAR ROAR!!] Together with the roar of the Flame Unicorn Beast, the entire cave trembled even more severely.Lou Mu Yan ran towards the exit of the cave, but only after a bit more than ten steps, the ground cracked open into numerous fissures and from within rose an inexplicable gravitational force, sucking her in.She didn't even have the time to use her Flash Step, and her body fell towards the bottomless crack with the gravitational force.She could only feel the pressure of the roar that lingered by her ear, then her vision blacked out and she felt herself slowly losing consciousness. Before falling unconscious, she rolled her eyes inwardly\u2014this damned body was just too weak.1Often seen on the head of mythical tigers or tigers in general\u2014same word as 'King'.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her mind was also invaded by that same force, but it wasn't aggressive and only helped her wake up immediately.She landed on the ground supported by that power and when she opened her eyes she met a pair of eyes that were as deep and dark as ink.Currently, there was a young man standing on a large rock opposite her. He was dressed in enchanting red robes with black hair lightly lifted by the wind, had a tall, sturdy figure, straight nose, naturally thin red lips, and a flawless face that appeared to be meticulously sculpted and polished\u2014he was immaculately handsome.The man exuded a naturally noble temperament, and he inadvertently revealed a fierce, domineering countenance, as if an almighty sovereign that was looking down upon all living beings.Right now, the devilishly handsome man looked at her calmly.Lou Mu Yan knew that this man saved her, otherwise she would've been handicapped after a fall from such a height if she didn't die.\u201cThank you very much!\u201d Lou Mu Yan looked at the man with gratitude, promising: \u201cYour life-saving grace will definitely be repaid in the future.\u201d\u201cStupid woman.\u201d The man curled his lips and smiled devilishly. He suddenly moved his gaze away from her and looked in another direction, his eyebrows furrowing lightly. Then he turned and dashed that way, vanishing into thin air.Lou Mu Yan was stunned\u2014that devilish man actually said she was a 'stupid woman'\u2026Feeling a strong wave of Elemental Energy in that direction, she looked at the place curiously, mused a little, then followed.The man's speed was extremely fast. She needed to use her Flash Step to be able to prevent herself from falling behind too much. After around a quarter of an hour, the man entered a large cave that appeared in front of them, and she followed without hesitation.\u201cYou lowly humans, you dared to set foot in this King's territory, you are truly courting death.\u201dThe moment she entered the cave, a strong, pressuring voice resounded. If it weren't that she used her Mental Energy to shield her Sea of Consciousness, it would've been shattered by the pressure.She looked up and discovered a huge Flame Unicorn Beast lying in the cave that was at least five or six times larger than the previous. Its dark red scaled armour was faintly exuding a cold light.At Tier 6, a Demonic Beast could utter the human language, but based on the opponent's aura, Lou Mu Yan could determine that it wasn't only at Tier 6, but at the Peak-Phase of Tier 6, and its strength was equivalent to an Initial-Phase Tier 7.Lou Mu Yan stood at the entrance of the cave and after hearing the arrogant words of the man that referred to himself as 'this Highness', her curiosity grew even more.As far as she knew, the Flame Unicorn Beast was a superior Demonic Beast with fire-attribute energy condensed within its fur and skin that acted as armour. Its defence was abnormally strong amongst Demonic Beasts, but of course, its scaled armour and bones were also excellent material for refining weapons.Its blood essence also contained strong fire attribute energy which was exceptionally useful to Sword Masters that practiced manuals with the fire attribute, and it was even more effective when used to refine pills.The most important part was that the Flame Unicorn Beast's combat power was extremely strong, and practically every single one of them could fight someone at a higher level than them, such as this Peak-Phase Tier 6 Flame Unicorn Beast before her. It could probably even match an Initial-Stage Sword Sovereign.She sensed a powerful force from the man, and based on the fluctuations from his energy, she felt the man was at least Middle-Phase Sword Monarch. Still, his strength compared to the Demonic Beast was a little weaker.So what gave him this confidence and arrogance?Aside from domineering, confident and proud as her first impressions of the man, she also felt little bit of modesty, reticence, and reservedness that was carved into his bones, not at all like the temperament of an ordinary cultivator.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThe fact that he had confidence in killing the Peak-Phase Tier 6 Flame Unicorn Beast must mean he had his trump cards.The Flame Unicorn Beast was furious\u2014this damned, lowly human not only invaded its territory, but he also wanted its Crystal Core. He was truly too arrogant and bold.\u201cLowly human, this King must tear you apart today.\u201d For nearly a thousand years, no human nor Demonic Beast dared insult it like this. The Crystal Core was its lifeblood.Upon the fall of the Flame Unicorn Beast's words, Lou Mu Yan felt its pressure grow exponentially. Its eyes turned red, and from its nostrils, it snorted two streams of flames. With a kick, it pounced towards the devilish man.The devilish man sneered, stretched out his arm and a long crimson red sword appeared in his hand. He waved it casually and a violent sword aura whirled in the air. It landed directly on the Flame Unicorn Beast that was in mid-air.[PENG!] Although the scaled armour on the Flame Unicorn Beast wasn't harmed, its entire gigantic body was blasted by the sword aura and crashed into a rock on the opposite side.The Flame Unicorn Beast had never been treated like this before. It turned over, its eyes bloodshot and filled with burning flames of anger, then took a deep breath.A pillar of fire sprouted from the Flame Unicorn Beast's mouth and that pillar of fire carried enough power that felt as if it could destroy the Heaven and earth\u2014it was one of the relatively strong abilities the Flame Unicorn Beast possessed.A touch of ridicule flashed across his lips. His red clothes fluttered, and he swiftly performed a hand-seal with one hand in mid-air. Amazingly, a pure blue crystal column appeared beneath his feet.Utilising his Elemental Energy, with a flick of his finger, that crystal pillar automatically shot itself out from the ground and slammed into the fire pillar.[PUCHI!!] The moment the blue crystal pillar met with the fire pillar, it instantly turned into countless ice-cold water droplets, extinguished the fire pillar and pierced the body of the Flame Unicorn Beast.Lou Mu Yan's eyes revealed a sliver of surprise\u2014this devilish man couldn't only use skills with fire attributes but also skills with water attributes that were so strong he could condense it into ice. He was very strong.This world was different to the Immortal Cultivation World in terms of elements. In the Immortal Cultivation World, those with only one Spiritual Root were considered the most talented, but here, Sword Masters didn't have Spiritual Roots, and instead, relied on their own comprehension of the elemental laws between Heaven and earth to cultivate.The more Elemental Laws one comprehended, the stronger their talent, but the difficulty of comprehending one after the other was like the distance between Heaven and earth. Many Sword Masters could never comprehend a second element in their entire lives.Lou Mu Yan was different to others, however. She owned the wise Heavenly Spiritual Root that had no attributes, therefore she had a high level of comprehension and was extremely talented. As long as she could eradicate her Terminal Meridians constitution, then she could comprehend the laws of all the elements between Heaven and earth.But the devilish man already used skills of two types of elemental attributes, who knew if he secretly owned a third attribute. With his age, he was definitely a prodigy amongst prodigies\u2014it seemed that not only was his appearance devilishly captivating, but his talents were also devilishly powerful1.[ROAR!!!]There were only wisps of white smoke where the pillar of fire and the pillar of water met. After a few droplets of blue ice water penetrated the Flame Unicorn Beast's body, it swiftly froze its eight extraordinary meridians, causing it to roar in agony.Pieces of red rocks were shaken down by the Flame Unicorn Beast's roar, but it continued to raise its head again and roar, glaring at the powerful, red-robed man that it previously belittled.\u201cHuman, your strength is indeed not bad, but if you think your level of cultivation is enough to kill this King then you would be too na\u00efve.\u201dThe Flame Unicorn Beast was completely enraged. It shook its red scales that shone with a cold light, and with the natural arrogance of a superior species of Demonic Beast, it looked down at the man in front of it.\u201cYou should be honoured to let this King use the innate talent of my species to kill you.\u201d1wordplay on \u5996\u5b7d (aka devil/monster/evil spirit etc.) which is often used colloquially in China to describe specific types of handsome men\u2026 mostly very sexy men, like how in English there's the phrase 'devilishly handsome'. It's also used as a term to describe people so talented and prodigious that it's not natural nor human, but instead, like a 'monster' of sorts (or 'devil' in this case). So it's describing that both his looks and talents aren't at a normal human (in this case, cultivator) level haha.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But she couldn't use her Elemental Energy to resist this sort of monstrous heat, so she could only clench her teeth, bear it, and not let out a cry of pain.The entrance to the cave was already sealed by the rocks that fell from the roar of the Flame Unicorn Beast, so she couldn't leave at all.But if she continued like this, her body definitely wouldn't be able to withstand this blazing flame that contained Demonic Energy. How could she save herself?She glanced at the relaxed-looking man, then clenched her teeth again\u2014oh well, she'll have to expose it.She shut her eyes, then released the Mental Energy from her Sea of Consciousness slowly, forming a barrier.The demonic flame was isolated outside by the Mental Energy barrier, and even though the tingling sensation still remained, she wouldn't be melted by the demonic flame at least.But as time went on, her physical strength also reached its limit. Without the support of her physical strength, she felt a little drowsy, and her Mental Energy was slowly unable to flow out.Just when a crack formed on the Mental Energy barrier, the red-clothed man before her turned his head as if sensing her troubles. A faint admiration flashed in his eyes.She only had the strength of a Sword Apprentice with a trash-type body and had no Elemental Energy, yet she could hold her own amongst a battle between two Sword Monarchs\u2014it was a miracle.What surprised him the most was that this little woman could actually condense her Mental Energy into a substance that could withstand the demonic flames, not to mention endure blazes that would even destroy a Sword King. It truly was admirable.With a wave of his hand, a blue beam of light instantly covered Lou Mu Yan and she a fluorescent, crystal clear ice blue bangle appeared on her wrist.A chill swept from head to toe and that hot, tingling sensation also disappeared. She removed her condensed Mental Energy barrier and looked quizzically at the man who had returned to fight with the Flame Unicorn Beast.Why did he help her? Including this time, she owed him two favours.\u201cGo die!\u201d The Flame Unicorn Beast let out a huge roar and a golden-red fire arc exploded within the cave. All the energy gathered towards and enveloped the man.[BOOM BOOM BOOM!!] The energy of the explosion was simply too strong. The cave couldn't support such destructive energy and instantly crumbled as countless rocks fell amongst the dust and firelight.Suddenly, Lou Mu Yan, who was engulfed by a violent energy, fell into a warm embrace.The deity-like man, with the Elemental Energy within him surging, narrowed his eyes. The scarlet long-sword in his hands instantly vanished and he drew the golden soft-sword around his waist.He channelled his Elemental Energy into it, then exerted his entire strength and slashed down.A beam of golden light cut towards the fiery flame that consisted of Demonic Energy. As they clashed, a blinding light beamed from within the cave, and the ceiling was directly penetrated.The excess pressure from the collision between the two types of energy blasted a hole on the top of the cave and shot directly into the sky. The flames immediately filled the entire sky above the outer ring and numerous Demonic Beasts scattered in panic.That earth-shattering energy exploded in the sky, causing numerous Mercenaries and Sword Masters within the periphery of the Blazing Mountain Ranges to stop in their steps. They felt a lingering fear, looking up at the flame pillar, glowing with a golden light, that shot up into the heavens. They could still feel its terrifying energy fluctuations even from so far away.Not daring to continue in the direction of the source of energy, many people in the Blazing Mountain Range turned back around and fled to the exit, fearing that they would be accidentally affected by the battle of experts if they weren't careful.However, the battle didn't end there. A cluster of golden runes appeared on the man's forehead. With a thought, the soft-sword in his hand instantly divided into numerous small swords that encircled the Flame Unicorn Beast.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cKill!!\u201d The man opened his thin lips and said coldly.[SHIU SHIU!!] The small golden swords madly pierced the Flame Unicorn Beast's entire body as if alive.[ROAR ROAR!!]The explosion of the Flame Unicorn Beast's strongest innate talent was countered by the man and guided out of the cave, while its scales were enveloped in numerous streams of golden light. They slowly cracked and blood dyed its entire body.It collapsed to the ground, roaring in agony as its eyes revealed a hint of madness. Even if it died, it'll take the terrifying man with him.Waves upon waves of Demonic Energy poured into its Crystal Core\u2014it wanted to fight till its death.The man placed Lou Mu Yan onto the ground, then said coldly: \u201cHumph, you want to self-destruct? In your dreams.\u201dFollowing, he drew a Void Talisman in the air with his Elemental Energy. He mumbled something, then the talisman automatically flew towards the Flame Unicorn Beast and landed on its head, slowly growing larger.Then, with the disbelief of the Flame Unicorn Beast, it transformed into a stream of golden light and entered its forehead.[ROAR ROAR!!] The Flame Unicorn Beast roared, unreconciled. He was about to explode its Crystal Core, but the man's talisman actually sealed the Demonic Energy within it.Impossible, impossible!\u00a0This man only had the strength of a human Middle-Phase Sword Monarch, so how could he be this powerful?\u201cDie.\u201d The man stretched out two fingers, tapped lightly, and the countless small golden swords that destroyed the Flame Unicorn Beast's defence combined into a golden short-sword. On its surface, there was even a mysterious rune circulating it.[SHIU!] The golden short-sword hovered, flashed a few times, then penetrated the Flame Unicorn Beast's head.The earth-shattering roar of the Demonic Beast stopped abruptly. The Flame Unicorn Beast's bloodshot eyes stared wide, carrying a sense of disbelief and horror, before it collapsed and took its last breath.Lou Mu Yan was also shocked upon witnessing this scene. She didn't think that the red-clothed devilish man's combat power was this strong\u2014he killed a superior Demonic Beast that was close to Peak-Phase Tier 6 without even using his trump cards.His talent was even more abnormal. Since the beginning of the battle, he actually used skills of three types of attributes\u2014fire, ice, and metal\u2014and he already reached an extraordinary level in his ease of switching between the fire and ice attributes.Not only did he completely comprehend the two contradictory attributes, but he could also interchange between the elements when battling. This simply wasn't something an ordinary person could do.Lou Mu Yan had to admit that a man who could utilise those elements so skilfully must be a peerless genius only seen once in ten thousand years. He could even compare to herself.Who was this man? He definitely didn't belong to Yan'zhou Country.Even after killing the Demonic Beast with Peak-Phase Tier 6 strength, he was still calm and composed, without any signs of exhaustion, as if this was only a trivial matter.With a wave of his hand, the golden short-sword returned to his hand, then transformed into a golden soft-sword and obediently returned to the sash around his waist.There was indifference in his beautiful phoenix-type eyes as he walked beside the corpse of the Flame Unicorn Beast. With a casual grab, a small, crimson Crystal Core the size of a fist, exuding a faint golden light landed in his hands.Then he lifted his eyes slightly and looked at Lou Mu Yan, hesitated, then said: \u201cThis Highness is going to refine this Crystal Core. Do as you wish.\u201dHe ignored Lou Mu Yan after that, then crossed his legs, closed his eyes and began to refine the crimson Crystal Core of the Flame Unicorn Beast.Lou Mu Yan opened her mouth slightly, wanting to remind the man that directly refining a Crystal Core was not only dangerous, but it could even cause his body to accumulate fire poison. However, seeing that the man already began to refine it without any hesitation, and assuming that he probably had his own solution to it, she swallowed what she wanted to say.She was also extremely exhausted, so she sat on a rock nearby the man, closed her eyes and rested.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her body had recovered almost entirely now.She stretched her numb neck, then looked at the man not far away. She discovered that his eyebrows were deeply furrowed, his face flushed crimson, and the red Crystal Core in his hand had already turned a greyish white.He was forcibly refining the Flame Unicorn Beast's Core, and it appeared that he was experiencing the violent energy of the Crystal Core invading his meridians.Lou Mu Yan frowned slightly. She walked closer to the man and stared at his wrist. It was indeed a light purple.The man's current condition wasn't optimistic. The Peak-Phase Tier 6 Demonic Beast Core was at a higher phase than this man's abilities. Not only was the energy that the Core emitted uncontrollable when absorbed, raged and scattered in his body, but he must also endure the agony of bursting blood vessels.According to her observation, the blue-purple colour of his veins was already very deep, which indicated that this wasn't the first time the man directly absorbed the energy from a Crystal Core. A large amount of fire poison had already accumulated in his body and if he didn't remove it, it could be detrimental to his future cultivation.Based on the devilish man's temperament and strength, it shouldn't be a difficult task to ask an Alchemist to synthesise the Crystal Core's energy by adding specific Spiritual Herbs. Yet he chose to directly refine and absorb the Crystal Core, so it probably related to his cultivation methods.Seeing that the man's red face was even more flushed, a layer of sweat dripped down his nose, and his brows were furrowed tightly, it appeared he was enduring extreme pain despite his calm exterior.She sighed. This devilish man saved her twice despite being complete strangers. Such kindness was rare. She should help him.Having decided that, Lou Mu Yan walked beside a rock, and took out a cauldron and a pile of Spiritual Herbs to prepare to refine pills.The Blazing Mountain Range was already a scorching hot place, so the temperature within this hole within a cave was more than ten times higher. Even now she was still relying on the ice jade from her brother and the ice bangle on her wrist to withstand the heat. So if she refined pills in this place, she could probably even obtain double the results with half the effort.She initially wanted to return to the Imperial Capital to buy a better cauldron to refine pills, but because of the needs of this devilish man and since the underground flames in this place were ideal, she decided to refine her own Marrow Cleansing Pill as well.After her preparations, she calmed her heart and emptied her mind. She would first use the geothermal heat here to refine the Spirit Cleansing Pill to detoxify the fire poison that the man accumulated from absorbing the Crystal Core.As she had no Spiritual Energy, and her cultivation base also hadn't reached the Core Formation Stage, Lou Mu Yan couldn't use the Pill Flame to refine pills. Fortunately, she specifically bought the charcoal used for refining pills before she set off on her journey.She hadn't refined a pill for a long time, not to mention her body was weak, so she decided not to refine the Spirit Cleansing Pill in one go. Instead, she isolated a few low-grade Spiritual Herbs and began to refine the Grade 1 Spiritual Energy Replenishing Pill for practice.All Sword Cultivators in this world absorbed the Spiritual Force of Heaven and earth which was converted into Elemental Energy within them, so the Spiritual Energy Replenishing Pill could also replenish Elemental Energy.In reality, Spiritual Energy and Elemental Energy were very similar to each other, but the Spiritual Energy she converted from the Spiritual Force was more refined and purer than the Elemental Energy of this world.[PU! PU!]Lou Mu Yan furrowed her brows and sighed. She failed again. She was accustomed to using Spiritual Energy to envelop the Spiritual Herbs while refining, so now that she was only relying on Mental Energy to control it, she was rather uncustomed to it and found it difficult.But she was the type to fight harder the more she stumbled. After wiping the sweat from her forehead, she started again.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksA day later, in Lou Mu Yan's hands were five smooth, round white pills. She put them in a white porcelain bottle, closed her eyes to rest for two hours, and when she recovered enough, she began to refine the Spirit Cleansing Pill.She threw the Spiritual Herbs that were easy to refine into the cauldron first, observed the flame and temperature with her Mental Energy, and controlled the flame by adding more charcoal. After the Spiritual Herbs were refined into powder, she wrapped it in her Mental Energy, then began to refine the next Spiritual Herb.If it were back during those times in the Immortal Cultivation World, she would've been able to refine the Spirit Cleansing Pill with peak-quality with her eyes closed, and with all the ingredients tossed in at the same time.She concentrated on refining each individual Spiritual Herb separately, and half a day later, a soothing aroma seeped out the cauldron.Delighted, Lou Mu Yan slapped the cauldron, and five smooth, lustrous white pills flew out. She quickly placed them into a porcelain bottle.Then, feeling the weariness catch up to her, she fell on her bottom and panted as sweat covered her forehead.After feeling more comfortable, she stood up and walked over to the devilish man's side.But the moment she squatted and neared, even before touching the man, he opened his eyes. A trace of scarlet flashed in his black eyes that glistened like the stars in the sky, emphasising his devilish charm. Lou Mu Yan stared at the man as if she would be sucked into those eyes that were as deep as a well.Their breaths were entangled with each other's, and Lou Mu Yan froze. Realising their distance, she shifted away slightly. From the white porcelain bottle, she tipped out one Spirit Cleansing Pill and placed it near the man's mouth with a smile in her eyes, saying nonchalantly: \u201cThis pill can help you detoxify your fire poison. Whether you eat or not, it's up to you.\u201dMing Xiu naturally could determine whether there was any problem with this pill or not, so he consumed the pill directly from Lou Mu Yan's hands. Then he shut his eyes and began refining and absorbing the medicinal properties of the Spirit Cleansing Pill.Upon seeing this, Lou Mu Yan walked towards a lava rock nearby and sat down to recover. According to her judgement, it would take approximately one day for the man to detoxify himself and finish refining the Crystal Core.She had to take advantage of this time to refine the Marrow Cleansing Pill. After all, once she returned, she wouldn't be able to encounter a place with such abundant amount of high-quality natural fire anymore.After resting for more than two hours, she discovered that her physical strength was practically restored, so she returned beside the magma, took out her cauldron and began to refine the Marrow Cleansing Pill.The Marrow Cleansing Pill was more complex and troublesome than the Spirit Cleansing Pill, particularly when refining the Flame Fruit as the refinement and purity of it was very demanding.She threw one Flame Fruit into the cauldron first, then tossed in some charcoal to increase the flames to its most powerful. As she inserted her entire Mental Energy into the cauldron to wrap around the red fruit, she began to roast it.When the red skin of the Flame Fruit slowly started to wrinkle and the flesh softened, she immediately removed half the charcoal, halving the flames, and roasted it with a small fire.An hour later, the red fruit in the cauldron gradually softened into a pool of purple liquid. She used her Mental Energy to wrap the liquid into three separate portions, increased the fire power and smoked them one by one.Time slipped by bit by bit, and with Lou Mu Yan's precise fire control, the dark purple liquid changed into a pile of red powder.Lou Mu Yan sighed in relief. Fortunately she was very familiar with the refining process of the Flame Fruit and the required degrees of firepower, otherwise she really wouldn't be able to sustain herself if it took more than one try.She reached out and wiped the sweat on her forehead, then used her Mental Energy to physically wrap around the red powder to isolate it. Afterwards, she picked up another Spiritual Herb and tossed it into the cauldron, controlled the flames to grill, roast, and smoke, and stopped only when she finally turned it into a pile of powder.Spiritual Herbs were placed into the cauldron one by one, and because of her powerful Mental Energy, she didn't need to take out the powders from the cauldron like other Alchemists. She only required her Mental Energy to envelope it and isolate it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Otherwise she would've already passed out.When she remembered that once she refined the Marrow Cleansing Pill, she'd be able to eradicate her trash constitution, she immediately filled with energy and stood up to purify the ingredients.The purification process was much simpler than the refining process. The powder wrapped in her Mental Energy was placed above the controlled flames to smoke. The colour of the powder gradually darkened, and when there were only around two thirds of the powder left, it meant the purification process was successful.The next step was to condense the pill, which was the most important part. One couldn't pause or rest during the process.The key to condensing the pill was the duration and degree of heating. It just so happened that she had a wealth of experience in Alchemy, so at each stage, she controlled the size of the flames perfectly.The dozen or so piles of different coloured powder gradually separated then combined under the control of her Mental Energy, slowly being grilled.Confidence and determination flashed in her eyes, and she focused on the cauldron. She quickly entered a state of mind where she immersed herself in the refinement.Time passed slowly and the powder in the cauldron condensed into two rudimentary-form pills. She immediately took out a portion of the charcoal again and used a small fire to smoke it.Not long after, a strong medicinal aroma seeped through the cauldron and spread throughout the cave.Lou Mu Yan exhaled a stale breath. Her eyes lit up with joy and with a pat of her hand on the cauldron, two smooth, white, and lustrous pills landed in her hands.But this wasn't the best place to take the Marrow Cleansing Pill. She still needed to pair this with a type of medicinal solution she needed to refine to cleanse her marrow. Only then would it have the best results. Therefore, she took out a porcelain bottle she prepared and placed the pill in it.It took half a day for her to refine the Marrow Cleansing Pill, and after putting away her cauldron and Spiritual Herbs, she looked up at the devilish man.The flush on his face had faded completely while the golden runes on his forehead flashed exceptionally bright, and the Flame Unicorn Beast's Crystal Core also turned into a pile of grey dust on the ground.The fluctuations of energy in the man's body were very powerful now and he rounded the traces of energy together within in. What surprised Lou Mu Yan, however, was that he was actually refining the fire poison in his body.Suddenly, the Spiritual Force of Heaven and earth around them flooded into the cave as if having gone crazy after being summoned by something, and directly formed clusters of Spirit Clouds. When it found the devilishly handsome man in the cave, they darted towards him and poured into his body.Lou Mu Yan watched fixatedly as the waves of Spiritual Energy were being absorbed by the man so easily as if he were a sponge. What a monster! What should she, a person who couldn't even absorb the Spiritual Force of Heaven and earth, be feeling?Time passed bit by bit and the man didn't appear to have any intention of stopping his actions. Lou Mu Yan stared at him with interest, leaning against a stone pillar.Based on this situation, she could guess that the fire poison in this devilish man's body had already accumulated to a certain degree. So, after taking the Spirit Cleansing Pill, he not only detoxified himself but also withstood the potential bursting of his blood vessels due to the Crystal Core's powers, and even took advantage of the residual fire poison.He probably refined the fire poison in his body by forcefully converting it into a tonic and re-absorbed it. At the same time, he crazily absorbed the Spiritual Force and advanced directly to the Advanced-Phase Sword Monarch Stage.But he didn't stop there. The Spiritual Force was still gathering and pouring into his body and his cultivation base was still climbing.Lou Mu Yan couldn't help but roll her eyes while she watched this man who absorb the Spiritual Force as if his body was like a bottomless pit. Comparing oneself to another could definitely infuriate oneself to death. She, who couldn't even absorb any Spiritual Force, really wanted to go over and bash that monster up. Did he still want to get along happily?The situation lasted for a day before it stopped, and the man suppressed the Elemental Energy that was converted from the Spiritual Force within him, remaining at Peak-Phase Sword Monarch Stage. He didn't break through to the next stage immediately.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksSeeing the man's decisive choice, Lou Mu Yan couldn't help but reveal some admiration in her eyes.Not only was this man exceptionally talented, but he also had a very resolute temperament. Forcefully suppressing the breakthrough to the Sword Sovereign Stage allowed his foundations to be more stable. But not everyone could have this sort of self-control and a true heart of Dao.The moment Ming Xiu opened his eyes, he met the pair of bright, sprightly eyes like the ocean. He was in a great mood right now. His body had accumulated too much fire poison before, to the point it even affected his temper, making him occasionally very cold and irritable.But after taking the Spirit Cleansing Pill refined by Lou Mu Yan, he not only rid himself of all the toxins, but it also enabled him to refine the fire poison to advance his strength. It even allowed him to absorb purer energy from the Demonic Beast Crystal Core.He smiled bewitchingly. His voice was a little hoarse, sounding unusually sexy: \u201cYou can refine pills.\u201d\u201cSo what if I can?\u201d Lou Mu Yan raised her eyebrow as she played with a lock of her hair.\u201cLet's make a deal.\u201d Ming Xiu's lips curled up, his phoenix eyes slightly narrowed.Lou Mu Yan guessed his plan as soon as he said it, and asked tactfully: \u201cYou want more Spirit Cleansing Pills?\u201dShe didn't mind why a man who acted so cold before suddenly changed his attitude so quickly\u2014after all, many experts were temperamental.Ming Xiu chuckled softly, and a soul-stirring smile rose on his handsome face, saying: \u201cI like to make deals with intelligent people.\u201d\u201cWhat sort of deal?' Lou Mu Yan asked after hesitating. A favour was a favour, and a deal was a deal. She will remember the life-saving grace and repay it in the future.\u201cLou Mu Yan, you can come up with the terms of this deal.\u201d\u201cYou know who I am?\u201d Lou Mu Yan was slightly surprised.\u201cYoung Miss Lou is famous throughout the Imperial Capital. I'm afraid that there are very few people who don't know you.\u201d Ming Xiu fixed his clothes, stood up and walked towards Lou Mu Yan.Lu Mu Yan rolled her eyes. She definitely was famous, but she was infamous for being trash.Humph, when she returned and took the Marrow Cleansing Pill to get rid of and restore to health this damned Terminal Meridians constitution, she'll see who still dared to call her small trash.Ming Xiu arrived in front of Lou Mu Yan and squatted, looking at her eye to eye, saying: \u201cI want all the Spirit Cleansing Pills you have on you. You can ask for a price.\u201dHe was currently cultivating a specific type of cultivation method and must absorb and refine the Crystal Core of a Demonic Beast directly, but it also had its disadvantages.Directly refining the Crystal Core without being buffered by other Spiritual Herbs meant he would be accumulating toxin in his body from the energy. After the fire poison accumulated to a certain quantity, it would affect his future cultivation. But Lou Mu Yan's pills, coincidentally, could help him resolve this disadvantage.With the man lowered to her level, staring straight at her, and speaking with a serious expression, it demonstrated that he placed her at an equal footing and didn't underestimate and belittle her. A favourable impression of him rose in her heart.\u201cDo you still want the corpse of that Tier 6 Demonic Beast?\u201d Lou Mu Yan asked the man as she stared at the corpse of the giant red beast not far away.Ming Xiu glanced at the corpse. He already refined the Crystal Core of the Flame Unicorn Beast. Even though the scaled armour was still somewhat useful to him, but if Lou Mu Yan wanted it, he didn't really mind.\u201cWant it?\u201d Ming Xiu asked softly beside her ear.Lou Mu Yan felt the man's breath around her ears. His voice was extremely alluring, and an inexplicable sensation rose in her heart, like how one's knees could feel weak. She composed herself and turned her head sideways to look at the man eye to eye, a brilliant, gorgeous smile rising on her face: \u201cI want it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A rare arc of delight rose on his lips.\u201cVery well. This Highness agrees.\u201dLou Mu Yan looked at the devilish man's unconcerned appearance and sighed inwardly\u2014this was power. What others took as priceless treasure, in the eyes of experts, it meant nothing\u2014just like how she used to be.However, she wasn't a person who liked to reminisce and be stuck in the past. She was even able to be reborn in a foreign world after dying, it didn't matter if she was trash\u2014one day she would stand at the summit of this world and step into the ranks of the peerless experts.\u201cYou know, you aren't at a disadvantage in this deal.\u201d Lou Mu Yan smiled and blinked at the man, \u201cI'm the only person who can refine this Spirit Cleansing Pill. Even though the Spiritual Herbs used aren't rare, but the formula is one and only. The most important thing is that you'll get twice the result for half the effort if you take my Spirit Cleansing Pill for your method of cultivation. Not to mention, you won't need to worry about residual poison.\u201dMing Xiu's fingers within his sleeves flinched\u2014this little woman was rather intelligent. Within such a short time, she could actually guess correctly that the reason he absorbed the Demonic Beast Crystal Core was due to his cultivation method.\u201cWhat was the effect of the pill you refined last?\u201d He felt slightly expectant.Although he was in a state of semi-meditation earlier when refining the Crystal Core, he was still aware of what occurred outside.For a moment, Lou Mu Yan was stunned, but since she was discovered, there wasn't anything to hide, \u201cThe pill's called Marrow Cleansing Pill. It can change and improve one's constitution and cleanse the body.\u201dSeeing a flicker of astuteness in the man's narrowed phoenix eyes, Lou Mu Yan shrugged and added: \u201cBut it's useless to a person of the Sword Monarch Stage.\u201dMing Xiu raised an eyebrow\u2014was this little woman playing with him?\u201cThen this Highness will wait until you can refine a Marrow Cleansing Pill that's Grade 3 and above that could improve the constitution of a Sword Monarch.\u201dShe sneered: \u201cDo you think that Grade 3 pills are like cabbages1? I'm a trash that can't even use Elemental Energy, you think it's possible for me to refine it?\u201d\u201cThis Highness believes you'll be able to refine it very soon.\u201d Ming Xiu always felt that this little woman would give him many surprises.Lou Mu Yan's heart trembled, lowered her head, and chuckled softly, her voice as sweet and serene as a clear spring.After coming to this world, she had always been called trash and was looked down upon. She didn't expect that this stranger she met for the first time would say something like 'believing' in her. But it was also because of his belief that gentle ripples rose in her heart.\u201cSince you saved me, if I can refine pills that are Grade 3 or above, I'll give you priority in trade.\u201d A pure, genuine smile rose on Lou Mu Yan's makeup-less beautiful little face.Seeing the little woman's genuine smile, Ming Xiu's star-like black eyes deepened, and a devilishly charming smile rose on his lips. \u201cPromise.\u201d\u201cPromise.\u201d Lou Mu Yan nodded, then took out the porcelain bottle with Spirit Cleansing Pills from her interspatial ring and handed it to the man: \u201cThis is the Spirit Cleansing Pill. There's four remaining inside.\u201dMing Xiu took the white porcelain bottle that still had a touch of warmth from the little woman's palm. He held it in his hands and played with it, then motioned with his eyes, \u201cGo and put away the body of the Demonic Beast then.\u201dA delighted smile rose on Lou Mu Yan's lips\u2014one bottle of Spirit Cleansing Herbs in exchange for a Tier 6 Demonic Beast's body was a bargain. But she also knew that the man had deliberately let her, so she thanked him. Then she walked to the corpse of the Flame Unicorn Beast and used her interspatial ring to collect it.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksLuckily she was born into a distinguished clan with a grandfather that was the Empire's expert, so the storage space of the interspatial ring he gifted her wasn't that small. It could perfectly fit the body of the Demonic Beast inside it, otherwise it would've been troublesome.Lou Mu Yan returned to the man's side after collecting the corpse of the Demonic Beast, then took off the ice-blue bangle and handed it over, smiling and said: \u201cThank you very much!\u201d\u201cYou can keep it.\u201d Ming Xiu didn't reach out to take the bangle. He had an inexplicable desire to leave this token with Lou Mu Yan, so he did.Lou Mu Yan's eyes revealed a bit of surprise, but after hesitating, she raised her head with a smile and said: \u201cThen thanks again!\u201dShe felt that this ice bangle wasn't just an ordinary Spirit Tool, but since this devilish man didn't want it, she decided to accept it. After she refined the Foundation Establishing Pill in the future, then she'd gift him one for free in return.\u201cAre you leaving now?\u201d Lou Mu Yan calculated the time\u2014she was already trapped here for almost three days. She wondered what Ye Qing Han and the others were doing now.Seeing a thin layer of sweat on Lou Mu Yan's forehead and nose, Ming Xiu knew that this sort of environment wouldn't be easy for her, a Sword Master that didn't have any Elemental Energy to protect her. It was already amazing that she could last until now.It was time for him to return as well, so he said thoughtfully: \u201cI am. Seeing that we're acquaintances now, this Highness will see you off.\u201dThe exit had long been sealed, so if one didn't have any Elemental Energy, leaving this dark volcanic cave wasn't easy. He'll be a good person till the end. But he, who didn't have a lot of patience, sure made a lot of exceptions for Lou Mu Yan.At the drop of his words, Ming Xiu stretched out an arm and held Lu Mu Yan in his arms. With a push of his feet, they disappeared from this underground cave together.All Lou Mu Yan saw was darkness before her, but not only after, she stood within a forest in the Blazing Mountain Range. The pressuring and suffocating heat vanished as well\u2014she was out.The faint fragrance of medicinal herbs on Lou Mu Yan lingered around his nose. His dark eyes deepened even more.After flying for a little more distance with Lou Mu Yan, Ming Xiu landed within a spacious area within the thin forest. Only then did he release Lou Mu Yan, \u201cWe're now in the outer ring of the Blazing Mountain Range.\u201dLou Mu Yan pursed her dry lips, and with sincerity in her eyes, she smiled softly and said: \u201cThanks! The favours I owe you will definitely be repaid in the future.\u201d\u201cMing Xiu. This is this Highness's name. Remember it.\u201d Ming Xiu leaned his body towards Lou Mu Yan and whispered in her ear, specifically emphasising it.Then he stuffed a round object into her hand. With a mature voice that carried a sexy magnetism, he said: \u201cThis and the bangle is a set. Put it away safely. Let's meet again.\u201dAs soon as his voice fell, Lou Mu Yan could only capture a shadow flash by, and then there was no longer the figure of that red-clothed devilishly handsome man within this forest.Lou Mu Yan opened the palm of her hand and discovered that there was a round, transparent, deep blue coloured bead in her hand. Waves of refreshing, icy air instantly spread throughout her body with a comfortable coolness. It completely barricaded her from the heat. With her experience, she could tell that the bead definitely wasn't ordinary.She raised her wrist again and when she examined it, there was a small, empty slot on her slightly fluorescent, blue bangle. With a thought, she bit her finger and dripped a drop of blood on the blue transparent bead. The blue bead suddenly emitted a soft, white glow that enveloped her.Then the blue bead turned into a stream of light and flew into the bangle on her wrist. The two combined into one, and when she looked again, there was no longer any trace of the dark blue bead while the bangle's colour remained an ice blue.Lou Mu Yan's lips raised in an arc. The ice bangle had recognised her as its owner now, so there was also a sliver of connection between them. Sure enough, the dark blue bead was the key to the ice bracelet.She caressed the bangle on her wrist as she gazed calmly in the direction of the man's disappearance and whispered: \u201cMing Xiu\u2026\u201d1cabbages were very common in ancient China and basically the cheapest type of food to buy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After confirming that there wasn't any danger, she leapt up onto a tall, thick tree and hid herself entirely amongst the leaves to rest and recover her strength.When the first ray of sunlight scattered on the Blazing Mountain Range early the next morning, Lou Mu Yan opened her eyes and stretched lazily, her tiny face no longer pale.After taking the Spiritual Energy Replenishing Pill, she certainly felt energised and after a whole night of absorption, she actually felt she stored a trace of Spiritual Energy. It gave her another layer of guarantee for walking out of the outer ring safely.\u201cI wonder what happened to Ye Qing Han, I should go check the agreed location.\u201d Lou Mu Yan stood up as she muttered to herself, then leapt off the branch and dashed in the northwest direction using her Flash Steps.She had an agreement with Ye Qing Han that if they accidentally separated, they would wait for each other at one of their resting areas just outside of the outer ring. If there was no news after ten days, then they could return to the Imperial Capital themselves.Until now, including the time she was trapped in the underground cave, it had only four days, so she believed that as long as Ye Qing Han wasn't in danger, then he was probably already waiting in that area.After every few sections she travelled, she stopped to check her map. She was glad she bought this map, otherwise she would really be lost.In the afternoon, she approached the agreed place, but she didn't appear immediately. Instead, she slowly crept over with vigilance.When she arrived, she discovered that there was only Ye Jing and no shadow of Ye Qing Han and the others. She sneered, narrowed her eyes, then walked over.Ye Jing was sitting beneath a tree and was very displeased. Because of that trash Lou Mu Yan, who fell into the crevices of the Flame Unicorn Beast's lair, their return to the Imperial Capital was delayed.Now the Young Lord was searching for Lou Mu Yan with the others and even told her to stay and wait. She had enough. A ferocity flashed in her eyes\u2014if Lou Mu Yan dared to appear, she would kill her first.\u201cLou Mu Yan.\u201d Ye Jing was just thinking about how to kill Lou Mu Yan when she felt a presence walking towards her. When she glanced back, she discovered Lou Mu Yan exiting the forest not far away.It wasn't that Lou Mu Yan didn't see the killing intent in Ye Jing's eyes, but she didn't pay attention to such a small character. She had never provoked this woman, but she discovered that Ye Jing had killing intent towards her early on.She was a person who didn't like to leave roots to grow into future trouble. Since the other person was so vicious, then she wouldn't be merciful either.\u201cWhere's Ye Qing Han?\u201d Lou Mu Yan ignored Ye Jing's ferocious glare as if she wanted to gobble her up, and slowly walked over while asking.Ye Jing sneered: \u201cIsn't it all because of you, trash. Just because you fell into that crack, Young Lord took the rest to look for you, and completely delayed our return to the Imperial Capital.\u201dLou Mu Yan chuckled softly, but there wasn't any warmth in her eyes. She folded her arms, raised her eyebrows, and asked: \u201cThen what do you want to do?\u201d\u201cOf course to kill you.\u201d Ye Jing didn't conceal it either, then sneered: \u201cYou delivered yourself here, trash.\u201d\u201cYou think\u00a0you\u00a0can kill me?\u201d Lou Mu Yan's lips overflowed with a devilish smile, \u201cLet's see who dies first.\u201d\u201cHumph, you're deliberately pretending to be mysterious.\u201d Ye Jing knew that Lou Mu Yan had a very fast type of skill, so before she even finished her words, she drew her sword, channelled her Elemental Energy into it, raised her hand and slashed. Several sharp sword auras attacked Lou Mu Yan directly.Lou Mu Yan was prepared for this, so she moved to the left nonchalantly, avoiding those sharp sword auras. Her eyes deepened, then she swiftly dodged to avoid each and every single one of the sword auras Ye Jing slashed towards her.Then she took out a dagger and utilised her Flash Step to the fastest speed she could control, and with a flash, she arrived directly behind Ye Jing. Before the latter could even react, she pierced the dagger directly into her heart.Lou Mu Yan's movements were swift, clean, and neat. Only a short amount of time passed since their conversation to the fight, and Ye Jing, a Middle-Phase Great Sword Master, was instantly killed by her.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksYe Jing widened her eyes and turned her head in disbelief at the indifferent Lou Mu Yan. She never thought that this trash that she thought she could easily kill had such assassination skills.She miscalculated, but she was the one who first wanted to kill, so even if she regretted now it was useless.Her pupils gradually lost focus and regret rose on Ye Jing's face as she slowly slipped to the ground until she took her last breath.Lou Mu Yan took out a handkerchief and wiped the dagger in her hand. This was a Middle-Quality Spirit Tool gifted to her by her father. Using it enabled her to easily break Ye Jing's defence. She didn't like to kill, but she wouldn't let go of those that wanted to kill her.Just like people similar to Ye Jing. They didn't actually have any deep hatred at all, yet the other party repeatedly violated her baseline. Then how could she be merciful?After the dagger was wiped clean, Lou Mu Yan put it back in her interspatial ring. Her fingers loosened and the bloodied handkerchief floated on to Ye Jing's corpse. Her eyes were cold as she glanced at the corpse indifferently, \u201cYou were too careless.\u201dYes, Ye Jing was too careless\u2014she wasn't guarded against her at all, that's why Lou Mu Yan succeeded so easily. If Ye Jing used all the strength of a Middle-Phase Great Sword Master, then with Lou Mu Yan's current cultivation base, it would take a lot more effort to kill Ye Jing.Lou Mu Yan retracted her gaze and went to sit beneath a large tree a little further away, closing her eyes to rest. She didn't deal with Ye Jing's corpse\u2014to her, if she killed a person like her, then she killed them. There wasn't anything to explain to Ye Qing Han.Half a day later, the sound of urgent footsteps came from the forest. Lou Mu Yan could tell that it was the steps of Ye Qing Han and his subordinates. The moment she opened her eyes, she saw Ye Qing Han standing not far away, looking at her with delight.\u201cQing Han, you guys have come.\u201d Lou Mu Yan said with a smile.Ye Qing Han walked over to her quickly and sighed in relief, saying: \u201cThat's great, you're fine.\u201d\u201cI said that Mu Yan was a lucky person with good fortune, and that she would definitely be fine. Young Lord, do you believe it now?\u201d Seeing that Lou Mu Yan was fine, Old Lu's hovering heart finally settled back in place.They cared about Lou Mu Yan's life and death not just because of the treatment, but also because they truly acknowledged Lou Mu Yan as a person after the time they spent together, so they didn't want anything to happen to her.Lou Mu Yan's eyes were dyed with a layer of warmth. Ye Qing Han was the first genuine friend she made here, and Old Lu wasn't that bad either. She could tell that their care for her wasn't feigned, so she smiled like a flower: \u201cI'm fine.\u201d\u201cHuh? How'd Ye Jing die?\u201d A young man under Ye Qing Han looked at Ye Jing's body in surprise.Lou Mu Yan glanced in that direction, lifted her eyes, and said indifferently to Ye Qing Han: \u201cI killed her.\u201dYe Qing Han frowned, then looked at Ye Jing in disgust. Even though he hadn't spent a lot of time with Lou Mu Yan, but he knew the sort of temperament she had. It must've been Ye Jing who offended Lou Mu Yan first, so she suffered death.\u201cShe attacked first?\u201d\u201cYeah. She wanted to kill me, so I killed her.\u201d Lou Mu Yan shrugged. She was a little touched by Ye Qing Han's trust\u2014she definitely recognised him as a friend now.Ye Qing Han revealed some coldness in his eyes. This Ye Jing sure was bold. Not only did she defy his orders, but she even wanted to kill Lou Mu Yan. It was unforgivable. Even if Lou Mu Yan didn't kill her, when he returned, he would throw her to the Criminal Law Division and charge her for espionage.\u201cLet's rest for the night and return to the Imperial Capital tomorrow.\u201d Ye Qing Han said with weariness as he smiled at Lou Mu Yan.Lou Mu Yan also knew that they had spent a lot of energy searching for her, so she nodded with a smile: \u201cSure!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He nodded and said: \u201cTamed it.\u201d\u201cRight, Mu Yan, do you still have that white powder? Can you sell me some?\u201dThe white powder could render a Demonic Beast immobile temporarily, which was very beneficial to their Distinguished Sword Cultivator Clan that specialised in taming and training Demonic Beasts.Lou Mu Yan put down her cup\u2014this tea was too bitter. She still preferred to drink Spiritual Tea. \u201cI don't have any more on me, but if you want it, I can prepare a batch after I return.\u201d\u201cThat's great. With this powder, our Clan's low-level disciples could have an extra layer of guarantee when taming Spirit Pets.\u201d Ye Qing Han revealed a bit of joy on his handsome face, \u201cDo you want purple-gold coins or an exchange with other items?\u201d\u201cPurple-gold coins.\u201d Lou Mu Yan remembered that there would soon be a large-scale auction in the Imperial Capital, but she couldn't always take money from the General's Residence.Ye Qing Han nodded, then asked with a smile: \u201cPrice?\u201d\u201cWhatever. The herbs used to make that powder aren't that expensive.\u201d Lou Mu Yan considered Ye Qing Han as a friend, so she didn't hide anything.\u201cGive your crystal card to me, I'll swipe it to you.\u201d Ye Qing Han's dark eyes filled with a smile.On Chi'huo Continent, the Imperial Capital's bank issued crystal cards which were divided into different levels. There were white crystal cards, black crystal cards, and purple crystal cards which corresponded to gold coins, black-gold coins, and purple-gold coins.Purple crystal cards could store all three kinds of coins, black crystal cards could store black-gold coins and gold coins, while the white crystal cards could only store gold coins. The use of crystal cards was very convenient, as one only needed to use their Mental Energy, so even ordinary people could control and swipe their cards. In addition, purple crystal cards weren't something that money could buy, and it was also a symbol of status.Lou Mu Yan was once trash, but she couldn't help but come from a powerful family background, so the crystal card she used was also the purple crystal card.\u201cHere.\u201d Lou Mu Yan shrugged nonchalantly and passed her purple crystal card over.The formula for the powder was very simple, and it didn't use Spiritual Herbs either, only a few medicinal herbs that were slightly on the expensive side. She didn't care how much Ye Qing Han gave.Ye Qing Han took the card, paused a little, then directly swiped over one million black-gold coins, then returned the card to Lou Mu Yan, \u201cI'll swipe over one million black-gold coins for you. If it's not enough, I'll give you more next time.\u201dLou Mu Yan blinked\u2014a million black-gold coins? As expected of the Ye Clan's Young Lord, he sure was rich and generous. The cost of refining her batch of powder was only a little more than ten thousand black-gold coins.Then Ye Qing Han took out a wooden box from his interspatial ring and handed it to Lou Mu Yan: \u201cThese are some Flame Fruit I accidentally found when I was looking for you. You can use it.\u201dHe guessed that this Flame Fruit would be useful to Lou Mu Yan, otherwise she wouldn't risk coming to the Blazing Mountain Range, so he had been deliberately looking for it throughout their journey. Upon seeing any Flame Fruit, he and Old Lu would join hands to slay the high-tier Demonic Beast and obtained these Flame Plants.When Lou Mu Yan took the wooden box and opened it, she discovered that there were three crimson Spiritual Herbs lying within, and each one had a few fresh, bright red fruits hanging from it. Her eyes brightened\u2014with the approximately dozen Flame Fruits, she could refine a few more Marrow Cleansing Pills.\u201cI do need these Flame Fruits, so I won't be polite.\u201d Lou Mu Yan put the wooden box away and felt a little moved. The Flame Fruit was difficult to find and very valuable, so she didn't expect Ye Qing Han to be this generous.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cHere, keep this safe.\u201d Lou Mu Yan didn't like to owe favours, so she took out a white porcelain bottle from her interspatial ring and gave it to Ye Qing Han.Ye Qing Han took the porcelain bottle and opened the cap curiously. A faint aromatic pill fragrance immediately filled the air around them, and even Old Lu stared hard at the white porcelain bottle.\u201cWhat's this? The pill fragrance indicates it's a Grade 2 pill.\u201d Shock filled Ye Qing Han and he immediately plugged the bottle to prevent the medicinal properties from weakening.Lou Mu Yan explained: \u201cThis is the Marrow Cleansing Pill made from the Flame Fruit. It can improve your constitution, clear your meridians and after taking it the meridians used to absorb the Spiritual Force of Heaven and earth will almost double in size or even more.\u201d\u201cWhat? It can make the person's meridians nearly double in size and maybe even more?\u201d The shock in Ye Qing Han's eyes grew deeper and he couldn't help but exclaim.Then he asked in disbelief: \u201cThis Marrow Cleansing Pill was refined by you?\u201dLou Mu Yan was a Sword Master who couldn't even absorb Spiritual Force and convert it into Elemental Energy, so she couldn't possibly refine any pills. Yet despite being shocked, there was still a voice within him that told him that she could achieve it.\u201cIf you think it was, then it was.\u201d Lou Mu Yan rubbed the ice blue bangle on her wrist. If she didn't have her powerful Soul Energy and Mental Energy due to her two lives, then she wouldn't have been able to refine the Marrow Cleansing Pill.In this world, only Sword Masters with extremely powerful Mental Energy could refine pills and be called Alchemists. They were exceptionally rare, and other than Mental Energy, they also needed talent.It was very difficult to raise a high-level Alchemist, so Grade 2 pills on the market were exceptionally precious. Pills like the Marrow Cleansing Pill that could improve one's constitution and widen the meridians had never appeared before either, so it was conceivable how shocked Ye Qing Han and the others were.There was only one Grade 2 Alchemist in the Ye Clan who they basically have enshrined with constant flattery, but even he couldn't refine a pill of such good quality like hers, not to mention its effects.After pondering for a little, Ye Qing Han composed himself, though he was still excited as he asked Lou Mu Yan: \u201cMu Yan, do you still have any more of this Marrow Cleansing Pill?\u201d\u201cI've only got two in total, and I gifted one to you. The other one I'm leaving for myself.\u201d Lou Mu Yan shook her head.She entered a sort of state of mind when refining the Marrow Cleansing Pill, but even then she was only able to refine two High-Quality Marrow Cleansing Pills as she didn't have any Spiritual Energy, only relying on Soul Energy and Mental Energy.Disappointment flashed through Ye Qing Han's eyes, but then he smiled again. It was already a great gain to be able to have one pill of such high grade, so he was very grateful for Lou Mu Yan's generosity.Remembering Lou Mu Yan's current strength, he reminded her: \u201cMu Yan, except for the people you truly trust, don't tell anyone else you have such a pill. You mustn't have no defence against others.\u201dIf she was targeted by any experts, with Lou Mu Yan's cultivation base, then she would be in extreme danger. Although he knew that Lou Mu Yan was an extremely intelligent woman, but he still couldn't help but remind her.Lou Mu Yan smiled as she nodded, saying: \u201cI understand that.\u201d Then she added after thinking a little: \u201cIf I refine another Marrow Cleansing Pill, I'll save one for your younger sister.\u201dShe could tell that Ye Qing Han cared a lot about his younger sister. Thinking about it, the girl being poisoned before she was even born, making her unable to leave her house, was somewhat similar to her, a trash born with the Terminal Meridians constitution. Since she promised Ye Qing Han to treat his younger sister, and she even received so many Flame Fruits, then it was nothing to add in another Marrow Cleansing Pill for free.\u201cThat's\u2014 Then thank you so much, Mu Yan.\u201d Ye Qing Han revealed his excitement in front of Lou Mu Yan for the first time and promised with gratefulness: \u201cI will remember this favour I owe you.\u201dHe believed Lou Mu Yan\u2014this woman gave them too many surprises along the way. He would remember this favour that he owed.Although Old Lu's eyes revealed his desire and envy, but he wasn't a greedy person. He was satisfied if Lou Mu Yan could cure him of his chronic illness, so he wouldn't crave an extraordinary pill like that.After they ate at the resting station, they continued on their journey back, and after four days, they returned to the Imperial Capital. Ye Qing Han had business back in his clan, so he directly returned to the Ye Clan after leaving his contact details with Lou Mu Yan.Lou Mu Yan, however, didn't return home, but instead went to her courtyard in the Imperial Academy. She planned to absorb and refine the Marrow Cleansing Pill to unblock her meridians, then return home to surprise her family.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She placed the pill in her mouth and the moment it entered, it melted.The gentle medicinal effect flowed through her meridians. The Terminal Meridians constitution was mainly caused by the block of a person's meridians, so as long as the blockage was dispersed, then it would be able to absorb the Spiritual Force of Heaven and earth and convert it into Spiritual Energy.When the gentle medicinal effect spread throughout her entire body's meridians, Lou Mu Yan's eyes filled with firmness.She gathered the medicinal energy within her body together again, then, starting from her first meridian, she began to push forward.It hurts, it hurts\u2026\u00a0Every time the force of the medicine advanced a little, Lou Mu Yan felt that her entire body trembled with pain.Her forehead and nose were covered in sweat and her small face paled. However, she bit her lip to prevent herself from making a sound and continued to use her Mental Energy to control the medicinal energy to shove against her blocked meridians.After her first meridian was unblocked, Lou Mu Yan's whole body was wet with sweat, and her face was drained of blood. But she didn't give up nor rest, and continued to push through the second, third\u2026When the last meridian was unblocked, she opened her mouth and gasped heavily for air. After resting a little, she took out the Spiritual Energy Enhancing Pill and swallowed it, then continued to sit cross-legged to refine and absorb the medicinal effects.This time, the result didn't disappoint those who tried1\u2014not only did she open all her blocked meridians, but she also endured the pain and used her Mental Energy to guide the medicinal effects to help more than double the width of her meridians.The medicinal effects of the Spiritual Energy Enhancing Pill were also dissolving in her body and a coolness spread throughout, nourishing the widened meridians.A day later, Lou Mu Yan opened her eyes that appeared filled with dazzling stars and a full smile adorned her face. She stood up and washed herself, then ate something simple.It took her an entire three days to unblock her meridians. She took a look at the twinkling stars in the night sky, then walked towards the middle of the courtyard and sat cross-legged on a stone platform to absorb the Spiritual Force of Heaven and earth to her heart's content.The next day, only when the first ray of morning glow fell on Lou Mu Yan, did she open her eyes and stretch lazily, a cheerful smile on her lips.Ever since coming here, she hadn't been able to absorb the Spiritual Force of Heaven and earth, so there wasn't any Spiritual Energy in her body. It always felt like she was missing something. Now that her meridians were unblocked, not to mention doubled the size, the speed of absorbing the Spiritual Force was even faster than the average Sword Masters by almost two to three times.Only when the traces of the Spiritual Force soaked into her skin and travelled to the various veins in her body, did she feel a sense of security in her heart.Her body was like a bottomless pit, filling up the Spiritual Force that she had been lacking for many years overnight. She felt that her whole body was now full of strength, and even if she was still weak, it was a good start.She took a deep breath, then punched a rockery within the courtyard, and it instantly exploded into numerous halves.\u201cOnly the strength of the Eleventh-Layer Meditation Stage, I need to quickly find the Spiritual Herbs to refine the Foundation Establishment Pill.\u201d Lou Mu Yan unclenched her hand as she muttered to herself.After tidying up briefly, she left the courtyard and rode the Tailwind Horse back to the Lou Clan in the Imperial Capital.Right when Lou Mu Yan disappeared from the entrance of the Imperial Academy, two men walked out, their eyes closely following the disappearing figure.\u201cYi Xuan, do you feel that the aura from Lou Mu Yan has changed?\u201d Yun Jin asked Chi Yi Xuan in surprise.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThere was complexity in Chi Yi Xuan's eyes, then he retracted his gaze and said simply: \u201cIf I didn't see incorrectly, she was already an Initial-Phase Great Sword Master.\u201d\u201cInitial-Phase Great Sword Master? Impossible.\u201d Yun Jin shook his head incredulously. \u201cWith her Terminal Meridians constitution, she couldn't even absorb the Spiritual Force of Heaven and earth to convert into Elemental Energy. How could she break through to the cultivation base of Great Sword Master? Did you see incorrectly?\u201d\u201cNo. The aura she exuded was definitely the Great Sword Master.\u201d Chi Yi Xuan said decisively. Because the cultivation methods he practiced was special, he could very accurately determine a Sword Master's cultivation base.Yun Jin stroked his chin and said with amusement: \u201cI heard she recently went to the Blazing Mountain Range. She probably had a fortuitous encounter.\u201d\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Chi Yi Xuan was recently in closed-door cultivation to prepare for the Academy's annual competition, so he didn't know that Lou Mu Yan wasn't in the Academy.\u201cI'm not very clear on the specifics. I just heard that she accepted a mission from the Mercenary Union to the Blazing Mountain Range, then followed the employer there.\u201d Yun Jin shrugged and said: \u201cShe never had a Tailwind Horse before. Though I've got to say, Lou Mu Yan's quite eye-catching now.\u201dChi Yu Xian frowned slightly, then said: \u201cLet's go.\u201dLou Mu Yan rode directly back to the Marshal's Mansion. The moment she hopped off the Tailwind Horse, she saw a grey-haired, spirited old man who smiled and opened the door excitedly. \u201cYoung Miss, you're finally back.\u201d\u201cGrandpa Yi!\u201d Lou Mu Yan shouted with an affectionate smile.This old man was the chief steward of the Marshal's Mansion and had always taken good care of her. He was also an old associate who fought alongside her grandfather in the past. As he had never married, he now settled in the Marshal's Mansion for his later years and was an Advanced-Phase Great Sword Master.\u201cYoung Miss, quickly go to the lobby, Marshal, General and the two Young Masters are all there.\u201d Lou Yi looked at Lou Mu Yan affectionately. He always treated Lou Mu Yan as his own granddaughter and exceptionally pampered her.Lou Mu Yan nodded and handed the rein in her hand to Lou Yi, \u201cThen I'll bother Grandpa Yi to find a place for my Tailwind Horse.\u201dAlthough Lou Yi was curious about why Lou Mu Yan had a Tailwind Horse, but he didn't ask, took the rein, and said, \u201cJust leave it to me.\u201d\u201cOk, then Grandpa Yi, I'll head over to the lobby first.\u201d Seeing Lou Yi nod, Lou Mu Yan hurried towards the lobby where the people of the Marshal's Mansion used to discuss formal matters.And right now, several people were sitting in the lobby.Lou Mu Yan's grandfather, Lou Zhan Tian; her father, Lou Mo Yu; eldest brother, Lou Mu Bai; and her elder twin brother, Lou Mu Ting.Lou Mu Yan also had two uncles, but one was guarding the battlefield in the frontier, while the other left to travel.\u201cGrandfather, father, eldest brother, second elder brother.\u201d Lou Mu Yan entered the main lobby and addressed each of them with a warm expression.\u201cYan'er is back.\u201d Lou Mo Yu looked at his daughter affectionately as she entered the door, \u201cHow did you lose weight?\u201dThe corner of Lou Mu Yan's mouth twitched\u2014where did she lose weight? She was just right.\u201cHumph, stinky girl, you still know to return?\u201d Lou Zhan Tian snorted, but the smile in his eyes still revealed that he was very happy.Lou Mu Yan immediately stepped forward right beside her grandfather to appease him: \u201cGrandpa, didn't I come back to surprise you?\u201d\u201cStinky girl, what sort of surprise could you give us?\u201d Lou Mu Ting tugged at Lou Mu Yan's arm and the face that looked highly similar to Lou Mu Yan's wore a brilliant smile.Lou Mu Bai's handsome face also revealed a soft smile and looked at Lou Mu Yan with warmth in his eyes.1those who try hard will have the desired resultPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When she finally returned, her parents and brothers had long passed away, so she, who had never enjoyed any family affection since she was a child, cherished the Lou family dearly.She spun around in front of them, with a bright smile: \u201cDid you guys not notice that my cultivation base has advanced?\u201d\u201cGreat Sword Master.\u201d Lou Zhan Tian gasped in surprise. Before, he only cared about whether his granddaughter had returned from the Blazing Mountain Range safely or not and didn't really pay attention to her cultivation base.Lou Mo Yu's refined, elegant appearance also revealed slight surprise and said: \u201cYou really are an Initial-Phase Great Sword Master!\u201d\u201cYou were able to refine the Marrow Cleansing Pill?\u201d Lou Mu Yan was delighted, then continued to ask: \u201cYan'er, you really cured your Terminal Meridians constitution?\u201d\u201cYep, I refined it.\u201d Lou Mu Yan smiled and nodded: \u201cI also obtained a few more Flame Fruits. I'll refine a few more batches of Marrow Cleansing Pills, and you all can take it.\u201cThe Marrow Cleansing Pill can cleanse the marrow and your body, as well as broaden the meridians. Now the meridians of my whole body were more than doubled in size, so the absorption of the Spiritual Force was much faster.\u201d\u201cThere's actually such a Heaven-defying pill. Then wouldn't it be able to change the combat power of the entire country?\u201d Lou Zhan Tian's eyes burst with a sharp glint.Lou Mu Yan held her forehead, looking at her grandfather speechlessly: \u201cGrandpa, the Marrow Cleansing Pill isn't so easy to refine. The Flame Fruit alone isn't easy to find, and right now I'm the only one in the entire Yan'zhou Country who's able to refine it.\u201dRight now, she didn't have any sense of belonging to Yan'zhou Country, so naturally she wouldn't bother to unconditionally help them refine the Marrow Cleansing Pill. It was more important to increase the combat power of the Lou Clan.\u201cTrue, it's better to take our time making a decision.\u201d Lou Zhan Tian stroked his beard, then looked at Lou Mu Yan and said: \u201cLet's keep the fact that you can refine the Marrow Cleansing Pill a secret for now.\u201dOnce such a pill was known, who knew how much it would shock the superiors of Yan'zhou Country, not to mention the entire land.Lou Mo Yu also nodded in agreement: \u201cYan'er, your current strength is still a little too weak, so it's not recommended to reveal it. Even if others discovered the existence of the Marrow Cleansing Pill, just say it was gifted by an expert.\u201dLou Mu Bai had told them before, so even though they were shocked and excited, they were still able to maintain composure.\u201cExcellent! My family's Mu Yan can finally absorb the Spiritual Force of Heaven and earth and cultivate Elemental Energy!\u201d Lou Zhan Tian was filled with joy\u2014his granddaughter could finally eradicate her Terminal Meridians constitution. It was even more exciting than knowing he could double the size of his meridians after taking the Marrow Cleansing Pill.\u201cYan'er is indeed a person of great luck.\u201d Lou Mo Yu's eyes showed gratification.The Divine Seer's divination was indeed correct. His family's Yan'er really did change after experiencing life and death, and there wasn't any need to bear the name of 'trash' in the future.Although Lou Mo Yu was hailed as the God of War in the Empire, but he was exceptionally handsome and elegant. His body wasn't as burly as Lou Zhan Tian, and on the contrary, he usually appeared like a civil official.\u201cThat's only a matter of course! My family's Yan'er is naturally the best.\u201d Lou Zhan Tian looked full of pride of his granddaughter.Lou Mo Yu smiled: \u201cYour mother went to stay at your maternal grandfather's family, so she'd only be back after a few days. If they heard you've cured your Terminal Meridians constitution, then they'd be extremely happy as well. I'll have someone send them a message later.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cYes, yes, we need to send a message to our relatives. It's a big deal for our Yan'er to finally be able to cultivate.\u201d Lou Zhan Tian laughed happily and said: \u201cWe'll also pass the news to your younger sister.\u201d\u201cYes, father.\u201d Lou Mo Yu nodded with a smile.Lou Mu Ting reached out and poked Lou Mu Yan on the cheek and said: \u201cLittle sister, your skin has become fairer and brighter after taking the Marrow Cleansing Pill.\u201dLou Mu Yan slapped the hand of her twin elder brother off of her and rolled her eyes at him, saying: \u201cThat's only natural.\u201d\u201cSecond elder brother, when did you come back?\u201d Lou Mu Yan had a tacit understanding and feeling with her elder twin brother, Lou Mu Ting.Lou Mu Ting's eyes darkened upon mentioning this, and a chill rose on his face, \u201cI heard that you were bullied, so I came back from the frontier. The Gu Clan's daughter really doesn't want to live anymore.\u201dHe was different to Lou Mu Bai. He preferred exciting and thrilling battles, so he was thrown to the frontier, where his second uncle was stationed, by their grandfather for training. He hurried back because he heard that his little sister was injured by Gu Yan Ran and almost died.Who knew that as soon as he returned, he heard that his little sister went to the Blazing Mountain Range. Originally he wanted to 'take care of' Gu Yan Ran but was stopped by his eldest brother. Since his little sister wanted to take revenge herself, he temporarily extinguished his thoughts of killing Gu Yan Ran.\u201cIt's just one Gu Yan Ran, she's not worthy of second elder brother to personally take action.\u201d Ferocity flashed by Lou Mu Yan's eyes, and she raised an eyebrow and said: \u201cDuring the Academy's annual competition, I'll let her taste the evil fruits she sowed.\u201d\u201cNow that's my little sister. Toleration's not the style of our Lou Clan.\u201dRemembering how his little sister constantly tolerated Gu Yan Ran and Zeng Rou because of Chi Yi Xuan, fury rose in Lou Mu Ting's chest.He softened his tone and attempted to persuade Lou Mu Yan: \u201cEven if Chi Yi Xuan doesn't really like Gu Yan Ran, but you can't change the fact that the Chi Clan wants him to marry that woman as a concubine. I heard that the Imperial Noble Consort and the Gu Family were trying to push for her to become the official wife. Regardless of whether it's possible or not, such a man isn't worth entrusting your entire life with.\u201dHearing Lou Mu Ting's words, the others also turned their attention to Lou Mu Yan.Lou Mu Yan was obsessed with Chi Yi Xuan, and even asked her family to open a backdoor for her to enter the Imperial Academy despite still wearing the title of trash. Due to this, she often had to endure other's ridicule and bullying, which caused a lot of headaches and heartaches for them.\u201cGrandpa, father, eldest brother, second elder brother, don't worry.\u201d Lou Mu Yan's eyes were full of decisiveness, and she said firmly: \u201cAfter dying this one time, my heart's like dead ashes1. He isn't a good match for me, and all my thoughts and energy are now on cultivation. As if I've got time to chase after him.\u201dHearing Lou Mu Yan say this, they sighed with relief. Lou Mu Ting patted his little sister on the shoulder and said with gratification in his voice: \u201cThinking this way is correct. After having strength, who dares to belittle you? Bully you? Humph, there'll be loads for Chi Yi Xuan to regret later. When that time comes, it'll be our Yan'er who doesn't want him and tell him to scram.\u201d\u201cAs expected of second elder brother, you understand me. Even if he changes his heart and comes back to beg me, I'll still tell him to scram.\u201d Lou Mu Yan raised her hand and clenched her fist in the air to express her determination.She could tell from Chi Yi Xuan's attitude that it wasn't that he didn't care about her at all. Combined with her previous memories, they had a good relationship when they were younger, but ever since Gu Yan Ran appeared, the two slowly walked to this point today.But it was undeniable that Chi Yi Xuan wasn't a qualified candidate as a potential partner. The fact that he was able to indulge Gu Yan Ran and Zeng Rou's bullying of the original owner of this body was also because he used Lou Mu Yan's deep love for him.But right now she had no feelings for Chi Yi Xuan, and even if she inherited the feelings of the original owner, she didn't even have a trace of attachment or daydreams left for Chi Yi Xuan. She had no interest in that sort of man and they were destined to not be fated.Afterwards, Lou Mu Yan had dinner with her family and chatted, then went to the treasury of the Lou Clan where they stored their valuables, found the rest of the Spiritual Herbs required to refine the Marrow Cleansing Pill, then went to her room to refine pills.1she had no hope for Chi Yi Xuan anymore. Given up on him entirely.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 22:\u00a0CousinAfter returning to her room, Lou Mu Yan lined up the Spiritual Herbs she 'ransacked' from the treasury. She took the Flame Fruits out from her interspatial ring, then placed them carefully with the Spiritual Herbs.She only used one Flame Fruit when refining the Marrow Cleansing Pill before, so including the ones Ye Qing Han gave her, there were a total of eleven Flame Fruits left.With this quantity, it was more than enough to refine the Marrow Cleansing Pills for her grandfather and the rest. Not to mention with her current strength, she'd be able to refine at least three to four Top-Quality Marrow Cleansing Pills per batch, so there wasn't a problem at all.Lou Mu Yan placed the Spiritual Herbs into the cauldron one by one. The Flame Fruit wasn't suitable to be stored as the longer they were kept, their medicinal effects would slowly decrease.Since her Terminal Meridians constitution was completely cured and she now had access to Spiritual Energy, it saved a lot of trouble when refining pills.Lou Mu Yan threw the Spiritual Herbs and Flame Fruits into the cauldron, carefully controlled the flame, and slowly began to refine.After several hours, the flow of medicinal aroma spread throughout her room.It wasn't until the evening of the second day did Lou Mu Yan extinguish the flames. With a raise of her hand, round, lustrous white pills flew out of the cauldron one by one.Looking at more than a dozen white porcelain bottles on the table, a merry smile rose on her face. This time, she refined a total of forty-two Marrow Cleansing Pills, meaning each batch produced nearly twice as much as her initial batch in the Blazing Mountain Range.Lou Mu Yan carefully put the porcelain bottles away with a sharp glint in her eyes\u2014these Marrow Cleansing Pills were worth quite a bit of wealth!With these Marrow Cleansing Pills alone, she could find a way to exchange for some more precious Spiritual Herbs. Once she broke through to the Core Formation Stage and obtained her own Pill Flame, then refining pills like the Worldly Reduction Pill1\u00a0was as easy as obtaining it simply by reaching out a hand.Lou Mu Yan clenched her small fists tightly, \u201cCore Formation Stage\u2026 I'll definitely reach it soon!\u201dDue to her strong desire for strength, Lou Mu Yan didn't continue to delay herself at home. After delivering the Marrow Cleansing Pills to her grandfather, she explained a little, then returned to the Imperial Academy.As the most powerful Academy in Yan'zhou Country, the Spiritual Force that gathered in the Imperial Academy was far more plentiful than her home.After a few days of unrestrained absorbing of the Spiritual Force in her courtyard in the Imperial Academy, she stabilised her cultivation base at the Final-Layer Meditation Phase, and she only needed to refine the Foundation Establishment Pill to advance to the Foundation Establishment Stage, which was equivalent to the strength of a Sword Spirit.More than twenty types of Spiritual Herbs that were necessary for the Foundation Establishment Pill could be found on the market, but the three main Spiritual Herbs were more difficult to find.These three herbs were the Deep Orchid that grew in icy places, so it could only be found in the Glacial Mountain Range, and the Seven-Leaf Ginseng and Purple Monkey Flower which could be found in the Southern Plume Canyon but were very difficult to find.Lou Mu Yan put away her thoughts, then touched her hungry stomach. \u201cIt seems I still need to refine some Inedia Pills!\u201dAfter leaving her courtyard, she discovered she would receive some strange looks from time to time, or secretly be judged behind her back. She sighed, gave up the plan to go to the Academy's cafeteria to eat, and walked towards Moon Billow Restaurant.Moon Billow Restaurant was located in the most prosperous street, the Vermillion Bird Street, and was the most famous restaurant in the Imperial Capital.\u201cHey, isn't that Lou Mu Yan?\u201d Yun Jin sat in a private room of the Moon Billow Restaurant. After scanning the streets randomly, he saw Lou Mu Yan who entered the restaurant.Hearing this, Chi Yi Xuan also looked down from the window, but only saw a corner of purple clothing, without any trace of Lou Mu Yan.In addition to the two people in the private room, there were also three others. One was the Empress's son, the Third Prince Yun Lan; another was the Prime Minister's grandson, Xiao Zi Ang; and the other, Yun Luo who accompanied the Third Prince in training, was the son of the King of Zhen'xi, the Emperor's younger brother.\u201cLou Mu Yan? Isn't that the famous little trash oof the Imperial Capital that constantly chased after Yi Xuan?\u201d Xiao Zi Ang touched his chin in thought, then looked at Yun Jin with curiosity, \u201cI heard that she changed a lot after being injured by the Imperial Noble Consort's younger sister? Is it true?\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cOf course it's true. She either ignores Yi Xuan completely or ridicules him.\u201d Yun Jin's expression was full of gloating, and he didn't even care about Chi Yi Xuan who's face already turned dark, \u201cOh yeah, she's already a Great Sword Master.\u201d\u201cHow's that possible?\u201d Xiao Zi Ang exclaimed: \u201cA person with the Terminal Meridians constitution can't absorb Spiritual Force and convert it into Elemental Energy. How could she have advanced to a Great Sword Master?\u201d\u201cThat I don't know.\u201d Yun Jin shrugged. He also wanted to know how Lou Mu Yan became a Great Sword Master.\u201dAfter Yun Luo returned this time, he also heard a lot of rumours about Lou Mu Yan, particularly about the promised battle between her and Gu Yan Ran. There were already numerous major gambling houses in the Imperial Capital that had begun to make bets on them.Thinking of Lou Mu Yan and her relationship with his cousin, he looked up at the young man who sat on the main seat and asked: \u201cA'Lan, Lou Mu Yan's your cousin right? She really advanced to a Great Sword Master?\u201d\u201cLou Mu Yan.\u201d The man in the main seat muttered the name softly, with a contemplating smile on his lips, \u201cAs far as I know, it's true.\u201d\u201cThen how'd she do it?\u201d Xiao Zi Ang asked curiously, wide-eyed.\u201cEven I'm not very clear.\u201d Yun Lan smiled with slight profoundness, then turned to the guard beside him and said: \u201cThere shouldn't be any seats left now at Moon Billow Restaurant, you go and invite Young Miss Lou up to have a meal.\u201dHe had heard from his Empress Mother a couple of days ago2\u00a0that Lou Mu Yan already eradicated her Terminal Meridians constitution. Today, he sure wanted to see if his cousin that he hadn't seen in many years truly had changed as according to the rumours or not. Of course, he was also very curious as to how his cousin advanced to a Great Sword Master.\u201cYes, master.\u201dCurrently, all faces displayed a little interest. Recently, the rumours about Lou Mu Yan came one after another, and they really wanted to see if she had truly changed.After hearing the shopkeeper say 'Moon Billow Restaurant' was already full, Lou Mu Yan didn't force anything either and was about to leave after nodding. But then she was stopped by a young man before she could exit.\u201cYoung Miss Lou, our master invites Young Miss to come upstairs to have a meal.\u201d The man was neither humble nor haughty, and his attitude was fairly respectful and polite.Lou Mu Yan asked in surprise: \u201cWho's your master?\u201d\u201cYoung Miss Lou will know once you go up.\u201d The man replied.Lou Mu Yan saw that the man's temperament was like a personal guard, and she was also curious about who invited her to a meal, so she nodded, \u201cLead the way.\u201dThe man didn't say much and took Lou Mu Yan directly to the only private room on the third floor.After pushing the door and entering, Lou Mu Yan saw five men sitting within, but she only knew Yun Jin and Chi Yi Xuan.\u201cCousin, long time no see.\u201d Yun Lan quickly scrutinised Lou Mu Yan, and a gentle smile appeared on his attractive face.Lou Mu Yan was startled for a moment\u2014cousin? There was only one person who could call her cousin, and that was Yun Lan, the son of her Empress aunt.She and this cousin had a very ordinary relationship before. Yun Lan was older than her by three years, and when they were young, they would often play together. But because she kept chasing after Chi Yi Xuan and ignored the people around her, she eventually stopped contacting this cousin.Yun Lan's teacher was the Empire's Advanced-Phase Sword King expert, so he didn't need to attend the Imperial Academy, not to mention he also travelled with the teacher for a few years and only just returned to the Imperial Capital. Within the few years, he and Lou Mu Yan had never seen each other, so she didn't recognise Yun Lan at first glance.Lou Mu Yan didn't reveal any of her emotions. With only a light smile on her lips, she walked over to sit in an empty seat beside Yun Jin, saying: \u201cHello cousin!\u201d1susceptible to change. The original Chinese is \u964d\u5c18\u4e39. My understanding is that it helps transform a person into a celestial of sorts by decreasing their worldliness and mortality so that they can more successfully become immortals. '\u964d' has two meanings: 'reduce/descend/lower' etc. Or 'surrender/subdue' etc. My take is that it's the first meaning. To reduce. '\u5c18' can mean 'dust' or shortened from '\u51e1\u5c18' which refers to the mortal world. You get the general idea. If I think of a better translation I'll change it.2Absolutely no idea why, but they censored this part and I just filled it in with my guess. The original was: \u524d\u4e24****\u542c\u6bcd\u540e\u3002\u3002\u3002 etc. Based on the context and the words given, it only made sense to fill it in with either '\u5929' or '\u65e5' which means 'days', or some measurement of time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Arthur said that he and Mingyou had the deepest bond, so he was the most suitable candidate for degeneration. Moreover, he had an injured leg, and he could be in the experimental group after he deteriorated.The polar bear said that he had the best body and the least injuries. Of course he should be chosen for the first experiment. The two quarreled and fought. The black cat waved his paw, and the polar bear waved his paw. The two exchanged blows, as if two martial arts masters were fighting each other.Mingyou tried to dissuade the fighting, but was forced back by the fierce black cat and polar bear. The big wolf was also shivering. He tried to break into the battle, but was beaten and thrown out by the black cat and polar bear.Mingyou sat on the carpet holding the wolf's head. The wolf lay on Mingyou's thighs and his front paws were holding his waist. The expressions of the person and wolf gave off the feeling of\u00a0 panic, helplessness and pity.The black cat and the polar bear fought each other for a long time. They didn't use their abilities or their teeth. They were evenly matched and one couldn't tell the outcome. In the end, they both collapsed on the ground out of breath with lolled tongues, like two panting blankets.Mingyou patted the wolf's head, and the canine immediately stood upright, with an eager pair of orange eyes. \u201cDon't rush.\u201d Mingyou saw the wolf's thoughts and hurriedly stopped him, \u201cBe careful of Snowy's ice.\u201dThe big wolf's tail immediately drooped. Right, even if the polar bear had no energy, he still had abilities. When could he defeat the polar bear and become the king?Mingyou walked over and patted the two motionless fluffies panting on the floor: \u201cI recommend letting Blacky try first. Blacky is my first partner, and we trust each other the most. Don't worry Snowy, nothing happens if the operation fails and will not cause damage to Blacky.\u201dThe polar bear's dark eyes looked directly at Mingyou's light brown eyes for a while. After a while, the bear turned his face and closed his eyes, \u201cI see, I believe you. . \u201c\u201cThank you Snowy! \u201cMingyou fed the black cat to recuperate some nutrition. The wolf immediately arched into Mingyou's arms, his tail almost shaking off. He wanted some too! The big wolf drooled.\u201cOkay, you too.\u201d Mingyou thought, whatever, he could only take out ten pills a day. He will take one more now, and then he will take one less later. It was estimated that arithmetic problems could not be calculated based on the wolf's current IQ.\u201cHow should I cooperate with you?\u201d After eating the nutrition cube, Arthur became energetic. His tail was wrapped around Mingyou's waist, and his expression was very smug. As he knew, Mingyou would definitely choose him.Mingyou said, \u201cTrust me.\u201d Arthur raised a paw and cleared his ear: \u201cThat's it?\u201dMingyou nodded, \u201cAlthough we have not met for a long time, I believe that the depth of a bond has nothing to do with time. We only met each other after crossing countless galaxies and times under the guidance of fate. This miracle with a probability that is infinitely close to zero is enough to prove our bond.\u201dThe polar bear stretched out his claws and expressionlessly scratched his ears. Mingyou was good at everything, but his declarations from time to time made him embarrassed. He pierced the floor with his two hind paws, and was about to dig out chunks from the floor.Arthur squinted and showed a tiger-like smile. Obviously, he did not think Mingyou's lines were too embarrassing, but they were very useful. Arthur stretched out a paw: \u201cThat's right!\u201dIndeed, Mingyou and he met through countless galaxies and time, it was a miracle and the probability was infinitely close to zero. When he and Mingyou met, they were destined to fire up the blood of the Star Alliance, they were the darlings of the destined era!There had never been anyone who suited his appetite like Mingyou, even the eldest brother who took care of him and the dumb bear who accompanied him when he grew up! Mingyou also stretched out his hand and tightly grasped the cat's fluffy paws. The two looked at each other, as if flames were burning in their eyes.These were the passionate flames of their bond! The polar bear walked beside the large wolf and the former reached out to cover the latter's eyes.Big Wolf: O_o? ? ? Polar Bear: Don't look, or you will be corrupted.\u201cAh, Blacky! I'm so excited!\u201d Mingyou let go and rushed towards the feline. Arthur squatted on the ground, spread his arms, caught Mingyou, and lightly patted the youth on the back.Mingyou pressed his cheeks against Arthur's head so hard that he felt like his cheeks were going to be rubbed bald. Arthur started to push him with a paw before he let go.\u201cQuick, quick! Let's try the degeneration technique now! If it succeeds, we can turn the big wolf into a baby wolf, and the furniture at home will not suffer every day!\u201d Mingyou clenched his fist. His eyes glowed with uncontrollable excitement, \u201cEven if there are eight more fluffies, our home will not be torn down!\u201dThe black cat remembered the crawling frame that had been chewed up. Gah!!! The young man worked so hard to create a climbing frame for him! It was taken apart by the silly wolf before he played with it for a few days! The polar bear remembered his battered bedroom.As soon as he didn't pay any attention, the silly wolf tore up his pillows, quilts, and sheets into strips, and the tables, cabinets and chairs were chewed, and nothing was okay. If the remaining eight comrades who had lost their minds all have the destructive power of the wolf\u2026As an ice-type superpower, the polar bear actually shuddered.\u201cLet's start now.\u201d Mingyou took out the spirit beastmaster bracelet from his system backpack.The Beastmaster's bracelet looked like an ordinary metal bracelet. When Mingyou put it on his right wrist, the bracelet seemed to melt and reformed into a transparent brace around\u00a0 Mingyou's wrist. If one didn't look carefully, they couldn't see that Mingyou was wearing something on his wrist.\u201cThis thing is cool, can our technology copy it?\u201d Arthur stretched out a paw to poke Mingyou's transparent wristband.Mingyou grasped Arthur's paw, and said: \u201cIt should be possible, but my current knowledge is not enough. When I redeem the blueprints, I will know how to copy it with Star Alliance materials.\u201d\u201cThat's yours. Before you know how to replicate it, don't tell others that you have this thing.\u201d Arthur said solemnly.\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d Mingyou nodded vigorously, \u201cRest assured, except for a partner who has signed a contract with me, no one can see the spirit beastmaster bracelet, it comes with optical stealth!\u201dThe polar bear had almost guessed Mingyou's secret. Although Mingyou didn't take the initiative to confess, Mingyou didn't avoid him while chatting with the black cat. Even if there were few strings in Mingyou's head, His Royal Highness would not be neglectful. His Royal Highness must have deliberately let him know about Mingyou's secret.This was a secret that only belonged to them and Mingyou. They could not reveal anything, even to family members. The polar bear believed that the other nine comrades-in-arms must also be able to keep this secret, and together they would guard this simple young man.\u201cCome on, Blacky, strike a handsome pose!\u201d Mingyou's feet were slightly apart, his hands moved in a circle, and then stopped in front of his chest, holding the spirit beast master bracelet with his right hand, \u201cCome on! Let the world feel a bond that is more dazzling than the sun!\u201dArthur shook his fur and tried to make his injured leg stand upright, his upper body slightly lowered, resembling a tiger descending the mountain. His eyes narrowed, revealing his fangs, and his expression changed from the usual lazy big cat to a domineering beast.The polar bear was shocked, a little glad that he was not the first beast to try this. Did he have to pose and say lines for degeneration? No way, no way? Wouldn't it be so embarrassing? While the polar bear was spacing out, Mingyou's and the black cat's eyes met.At this moment, they felt the other's heartbeat without using their empathy power. Badump, badump, the heartbeat was accelerating, but the rhythm was still slow.Mingyou's right hand touched the spirit beast master's bracelet, light blue spiritual power poured into the bracelet, which was turned into a powerful energy wave, and rushed to the liger posing as the tiger descending the mountain.When Arthur received this energy, he felt as if he had entered a different space composed of pure energy, and his energy also merged into this space. When he was about to lose his consciousness, he heard his heartbeat again.Badump, badump. It was the heartbeat of that silly young man. Arthur breached Mingyou's emotional depths again, the cold and dark sea. In the icy sea, there was a small ball of light, clutching a dilapidated pallet, trying to steer it towards a bright spot.This young man was still trying to save himself. Arthur smiled and sighed. Mingyou also breached the emotional depths of the black cat. Compared with the vague emotional touch before, this time Mingyou saw a scene created from Arthur's inner emotions.Here, there was a vast field full of flowers. The big cat squatted among the flowers, seeming to have a nap with eyes closed. This should be a warm and beautiful scene, but among the flowers, there were numerous stone monuments. Some of these steles were engraved with names, birth and death dates; some were more vague, with only records of death in a certain battle.The flowers blooming in the bushes were actually tombstones. Surrounded by flowers, the tombstones had spread to the horizon. The black cat squatted quietly like a graveyard's guardian statue. Blacky's optimistic heart, in truth, had always been entrenched in sadness.The heartbeats continued. Mingyou and the black cat were looking at each other across different spiritual spaces. \u201cStupid, you are thinking about it again. You are so sentimental, you need me to sing a song for you, how difficult is it for me to do it?\u201d The black cat disliked Mingyou's face.Mingyou laughed. Even if there was deep sadness in his heart, Blacky was still a sun that would illuminate others. The torrent of energy dissipated. With a pop, the black cat fizzled out like a holographic projection, which frightened the polar bear who was dazzled by the light.\u201cYour Royal Highness?!!!\u201d The polar bear pounced on all fours.\u201cMeow?\u201d A little black feline with a strange collar stood where the big cat originally stood, licking his paws and letting out a kitten cry. The polar bear slammed the brakes and almost knocked the little cat into the air. Arthur glanced at the polar bear with disgust, and kicked with his hind legs. \u201cMeow!\u201dArthur's eyes were wide, and he immediately meowed, while spreading his four paws, he ran from one end of the house to the other end. Arthur was so fast that there were only afterimages.Wow! His legs are healed! He can have fun! The cat was so happy. He began to jump up and down, from one cabinet to another, even on top of the polar bear. \u201cMeow!\u201d Arthur stood on top of the polar bear, roaring like a vicious feline.Polar Bear:???The polar bear grabbed Arthur from on top of his head, held the kitten in his palm and said with a trembling voice: \u201cMingyou! His Highness has a problem!\u201dMingyou took the little black cat that could be held in his palms, and said in doubt: \u201cWhere? No, he's very lively.\u201dPolar Bear: \u201cHe's too lively!\u201dArthur jumped, kicked Mingyou's poor nose, and leaped on top of Mingyou's head: \u201cMy legs are better, I can run and jump. Why too lively? Bear Herman, why are you so old-fashioned?\u201dHerman:??? What was this magical name?\u201cYour Majesty, even if you feel good, it would be out of hand to step on someone else's head. Your body just temporarily turned into a baby, not your IQ and mind.\u201d Knowing that Arthur had not lost himself due to degeneration technique. After gaining IQ, the polar bear breathed a sigh of relief, and resumed his previous cold attitude, \u201cTo be blunt, it's stupid.\u201dArthur put his paw in his hand and said righteously: \u201cThere was no one else, only you and Mingyou.\u201d\u201cIt doesn't matter, I don't mind. It's so beautiful to have a little cat on my head, people can't ask for more!\u201d Mingyou also said.\u201cMingyou, you will go to heaven if you pet His Majesty.\u201d The polar bear removed Arthur from Mingyou's head. \u201cAfter His Highness gets smaller, how can he restore his original body shape?\u201dMingyou said: \u201cBlacky is not too weak. So as long as he concentrates on mobilizing the energy in his body, he can transform on his own. It's just the leg injury that has to be healed step by step.\u201d\u201cIf it's Grey, I can use the spirit beastmaster bracelet to help him change when he needs to transform in an emergency. The steps are the same as degeneration. But my power is limited. I can only help the spirit beast degenerate and evolve. If you want to enhance the spirit beast's moves, you need to borrow high-purity energy crystals.\u201dMingyou asked the polar bear to temporarily lend him the ice gem: \u201cBlacky, you also have ice attributes too. Would you like to try to use abilities at this size?\u201dArthur jumped out of the polar bear's arms, proudly shaking his fur, and his tail cocked. \u201cTry it out. Let's turn the stupid wolf into an ice sculpture.\u201dThe big wolf understood and jumped behind the polar bear to hide. Although he didn't know why the black cat could actually become smaller, the smaller cat made him feel extremely dangerous. In short, he couldn't win.\u201cDon't bully Grey.\u201d Mingyou squatted part way in front of Arthur and put the ice gem on his beastmaster's bracelet. \u201cFeel this power\u2026Ah, Snowy, go to the kitchen and get a clean bowl. Blacky, first try to condense a piece of ice, and we will eat shaved ice later!\u201d\u201cShaved ice? You asked me to use abilities, just to eat shaved ice?\u201d Arthur slapped Mingyou's calf with his tail, but didn't stop him. \u201cI want to eat braised pork flavored shaved ice.\u201dMingyou thought seriously and said: \u201cOkay, I will cook a bowl of braised pork for you now. Should it be braised pork with ice or ice with braised pork? Or braised pork turned into meat sauce and poured on ice?\u201dArthur: \u201c\u2026Mingyou, you really don't have a humorous cell in your body.\u201d Mingyou was confused.\u201cOkay, let's eat fruit-flavored shaved ice and pour meat sauce on the remaining shaved ice.\u201d The polar bear brought a small bowl over, \u201cYour Majesty, do what you say.\u201d\u201cNo, I can't do it.\u201d Arthur said in shame, \u201cOkay, okay, hurry up and experiment. With this ice gem, can I really use abilities? Although my legs are better now, the energy in my body has not accumulated to the extent that I can use my abilities.\u201dIt was still very easy to change the subject with today's Mingyou. He immediately put aside the idea of pork shaved ice: \u201cNo problem, leave it to me.\u201dMingyou held the jewel in his right hand, touched his bracelet, and released energy waves similar to the degeneration technique rushed towards Arthur. His tail swayed, and a diamond-shaped ice block condensed on the tip of his tail.\u201cOh, that works!\u201d Arthur flicked his tail, and the ice cubes flew into the basin. \u201cIt's easier than using the ice-type ability by myself.\u201d\u201cBy using an external force to induce the spirit beast's energy, it is naturally a little easier than using their own abilities. However, this requires a high level spiritual beast master, and energy crystals are necessary.\u201d Mingyou explained, \u201cThis is actually very useful during childhood. Childhood teaching tools can help control abilities. Even if not under their own power, they gradually feel the flow of energy and can more easily master their abilities.\u201d\u201cSpirit Beast infant education?\u201d The polar bear nodded his head, \u201cVery useful.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cIt is more than spirit beast infant education. With this, adult spirit beasts can finally repeatedly train their abilities.\u201d Arthur said.After Arthur explained further, Mingyou learned that the way the spirit beasts use their abilities was very crude, basically throwing out outputs when they condensed their abilities, and they didn't use any techniques.Because the energy in their bodies was limited, their recovery was slow. So energy could not be spent on training. Especially for special spirit beasts, once the power was used, the energy in the body would be reduced by a little, and it was barely replenished from food. When fighting, they had to plan carefully, not to mention the extravagance of training.\u201cI have a little bit of all elements in my body. Although it is random and not refined, any kind of food can replenish a little energy, so my state is better than other special spirit beasts.\u201d Arthur revealed his shortcomings.Some big cats called themselves shadow ligers, but they were actually small and weak cats. Too many types of energy were needed to show any capability, and even the strength of supernatural power was very pitiful. However, Arthur played tricks with his very poor power moves, and firmly secured the throne as the youngest generation's top power.Seeing Arthur chin curled up in triumph, Mingyou nodded: \u201cBlacky is a master of coordination!\u201d\u201cMaster of coordination?\u201d Arthur tilted his head.Mingyou immediately hugged the little black cat and kissed him, and was slapped by the cat: \u201cA spirit beast needs to be experienced, not only to increase the energy in their body, but more importantly, to freely use their abilities.\u201cFor example, the ability of the same energy level would be more powerful after compression. But how to compress? Is it round or diamond shaped? Would it be more lethal if it is rotated? Will it be more concealed if condensed into thin needles? How to combine with different attributes moves? This is the ability to coordinate.\u201dMingyou remembered that in the \u201cElves World\u201d game, the chairman and chief designer of the game munchkined the rules and steamrolled ordinary players. First they prayed for rain to turn a tornado into a waterspout, and then used blizzard to create a water dragon. The attack turned into a cold water tornado, and it freezed as it moved, which created a freezing battle tornado.This was the magical effect of combo moves and required a strong coordination ability. Although the most influential players in that game were the CEO and Chairman, the rankings of the world game were fluid, and there were regular quarter-finals. However, as a powerful educator, Mingyou was very interested in coordination and wanted to study the subject matter.The spirit beasts of the Star Alliance could carry out large-scale battles with the Zerg invaders. It stood to reason that the use of these moves should have been studied long ago. However because the cultivation knowledge did not keep up, the spirit beasts did not dare to waste energy training moves, forming a vicious circle.\u201cWhen your stamina and abilities are restored, I will help you train supernatural moves.\u201d Mingyou had found something to do. \u201cAfter degeneration treatment, spirit beasts can also train in advance, which can strengthen the rehabilitation process. When you regain your original body shape, you can also master the moves you trained in the infant form.\u201d\u201cCome on.\u201d After Arthur spoke, he jumped to the ground and changed back to full-size with a bang.\u201cHow come you changed back?\u201d Mingyou said, while burying his face in Arthur's collar. Sorry, this was a conditioned reflex.\u201cI'm going to eat, it's stupid to not turn back into a big cat, right?\u201d Arthur moved his injured leg, \u201cI feel that the energy is running smoother than before. From now on, I will be a kitten for a few hours every day. Oh, yes Mingyou, have a good rest today since tomorrow you have to play the piano live \u201cAfter the Mingyou rubbed the feline, he raised his head and asked:\u201dEh? Why should we live broadcast piano music?\u201d\u201cMy brother revealed that recently the soldiers sleep poorly in the barracks. You should play some music for them. Although there are no energy fluctuations after recording, there's at least the placebo effect, right?\u201d Arthur was not sure, \u201cI heard that the placebo effect is very useful.\u201dMingyou laughed: \u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cWhen the time comes, the three of us will become small animals together, and frighten everyone.\u201d Arthur stood up and smirked up at the polar bear.The polar bear was entangled: \u201cDoes it have to have a pose?\u201dArthur sneakily said: \u201cNot only posing, but also to exchange a heartfelt vow with Mingyou.\u201d The big white bear was frightened.\u201cNo need, no need, don't listen to Blacky's nonsense.\u201d Mingyou hurriedly said, \u201cI and Arthur just saw each other's hearts because we took the initiative to show each other our secrets. Generally, it's just a blend of minds and no illusions even show up. Don't worry about your privacy.\u201dArthur sat down on the ground, raised his two paws waving frantically:\u201d I'm not, I'm not talking nonsense! \u201c\u201cYou are!\u201d \u201cNo there isn't!\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cYes!\u201dThe polar bear carried the back collar of Mingyou's clothes with one paw, and Arthur's nape with the other, pulling away the two naive ghosts who were inexplicably \u201carguing\u201d. The wolf stared at the polar bear for a while, then turned his head to signal that the polar bear should also grab the nape of his neck. It seemed very fun!Great White Bear: \u2026His heart was tired. He hoped that Yan Yi would be a little more obedient after becoming a baby wolf.The audience was looking forward to it, and finally it was time for the third live broadcast. This time, they collectively flooded the screen with protests, condemning the anchor for being too lazy. Why couldn't it be broadcast every day? It would be best to install a camera in the No. 1 Nursing Home so they could watch the live broadcast every second! Even if the live broadcast was just the prince sleeping\u2026\u201cYou have been banned, next time you violate the rules, you will be kicked out of the live broadcast room.\u201d Administrator Bear Herman went online.The audience shivered, and the newly established offensive and defensive alliance fell apart in an instant. Kicked out of the live broadcast room? Wasn't this punishment too heavy?They were persuaded. It's fine to watch a live broadcast. Why did they ask for so much? The anchor was in a bad mood and asked for a month or two off. What cared if everyone doesn't have to watch? Who on earth urged us to protest first? Beat them!The audience began to fight internally like a mob. His Majesty the Emperor was so angry quickly that slapped a hole in the floor. \u201cA little threat made them give up? Are these still soldiers of our Star Alliance!?\u201d His Majesty the Emperor was very angry.The secretary suggested, \u201cWhy doesn't Your Majesty directly tell His Royal Highness that you want him to live broadcast every day?\u201dHis Majesty buried his fluffy lion head between two paws: \u201cIf Arthur disagrees, wouldn't I lose face?\u201d The secretary's mouth twitched, and he mentally slandered the emperor. With all due respect, he was already very shameless now.At the Dulan household, Ian was also frantically swearing at these weak people. When Lieutenant General Mundy, who was thirty years older, knew that the stupid boy was being used as a gunman again, he really wanted to shoot Ian away with a paw! However Ian was a weak brother who had just broken through the S-rank and could not transform into a beast!Compared to Herman! Although he was a little simpler when he was a child, His Majesty Arthur abducted him as a guard with a lollipop, but at any rate Herman was a natural S-level supernatural ability, and he could transform into a beast when he was in elementary school. His brain is a little slow, but that could be explained as the energy being spent on his abilities.But what about Ian? Only S-grade now! His mind was not smart either! He was only half of Herman in the end! How many times had he been bullied! Lieutenant Mundy was very tired. He was talking about the live broadcast and quickly turned to Herman. He needed to watch the polar bear to cleanse his eyes so as not to be pissed off by Ian!Yan Tong received a special notice from Arthur to start the live broadcast in advance, asked for leave early and returned home to wait for the rebellious cousin to appear. The Yan family had always stood in a neutral position, not participating in the internal power struggle of the Star Alliance. Behind their strict behavior, there was a philosophy of life-saving gratitude.The Yan family believed that the first rebel among the younger generation would be Yan Tong, who had not been very well-behaved since childhood. They guarded Yan Tong strictly, but they didn't expect that Yan Yi, the most honest child in the family, would actually stand on the side of Prince Arthur that no one was optimistic about at the time. He joined the special advance team organized by Prince Arthur.The elders in the Yan family were almost angered to death by Yan Yi. When the family announced in public that they would cut off relations with Yan Yi they didn't feel any pressure at all. Anyway, Yan Yi's parents had already been sacrificed on the battlefield, and they bullied an orphan who had eaten free food.Now, this group of people regretted so much that their intestines turned blue. They were probably waiting for Yan Yi to die, so that they could unilaterally announce that he and the Yan family had reconciled, and borrow the hero's name for their own benefit. Yan Tong laughed sarcastically.\u201cHello everyone, I'm the anchor of the No. 1 live broadcast room\u2026 Hey! Blacky, Snowy, Grey don't fight!\u201d Mingyou just started the live broadcast, and was already interrupted by three small animals under his feet before he finished reciting the opening words.The viewers who entered the holographic live broadcast room took a closer look, there were indeed three little, cute but strong plush cubs beside the little anchor. Little black tiger? Little white bear? Little gray wolf?\u201cMy goodness! Is the anchor so amazing? He gave birth to three children so soon?\u201d\u201cHey, hey, not to mention whether the anchor can even give birth, even if he could, he can't have three children in just half a month! \u201c\u201cI don't care about that! I unilaterally announce that the anchor and His Royal Highness Arthur gave birth to a kitten, ah, ah, ah, I'm dead!\u201d\u201cYou wait to be banned. Huh?! You are not banned.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d \u201cOkay, no response, these three children are really born by the anchor.\u201dMingyou couldn't see the barrage, otherwise he would have blushed and loudly explain that he didn't give birth to anyone. He was now chasing behind the three little plushies of different colors that had started squabbling, trying to separate them.The cause of the incident was like this. Mingyou successfully helped the polar bear and wolf degenerate to their juvenile stage. That was it for the polar bear, but he felt that his body's abilities were stronger, his head was very clear, and there is no difference compared to normal.But at the same time, maybe because of the hormonal influence of the body, his behavior had regressed back to when he was a child. In short, arbitrarily doing things. Therefore, when the little wolf rushed to bite his ears, instead of using any ice abilities, he waved his paws and slapped the little gray wolf.The little gray wolf had become younger and his body had become stronger, but he had also become particularly aggressive in response. Did this little bear dare to slap him? Watch this wolf bite back!\u201cThe two of them squabbled from kindergarten to elementary school, and their relationship only gradually improved after entering junior high school.\u201d Arthur squatted on Mingyou's shoulder and explained, \u201cIt seems that your degeneration technique is not without side effects. Their minds have obviously become younger.\u201d\u201cBut, Blacky, your mind is fine\u2026Huh?\u201d Before Mingyou finished, Arthur leapt off his shoulders, flew between the little bear and the little wolf, and slapped each of them to the ground. Then he ran away with his tail held high.\u201cHurry up and start the live broadcast! Don't you think this scene is particularly fun!\u201d Arthur grinned while leading a little bear and a wolf all over the house.Although Mingyou thought that Snowy might think this is black history, he had always listened to the shadow liger's words. When the black cat said to start the live broadcast, he immediately opened it.\u201cOkay, let me explain. There are no new spirit beasts at the Spirit Beast Sanatorium. These three are Blacky, Snowy and Grey. Uh, has Grey been introduced before? It seems not? In short, someone new has arrived at the Spirit Beast Sanatorium. With new materials, I had new gains, and I can temporarily help them degenerate to their infancy.\u201d\u201cDegeneration is equivalent to energy compression, and their rehabilitation efficiency in this form will be increased. But degradation seems to make their character also return to a child-like state? \u201cMingyou look slightly annoyed,\u201dSnowy and Grey started fighting right after degenerating, were they really like this when they were young?\u201dYan Tong couldn't help laughing even while thinking about dark things. Although her smile was still very stiff, she laughed out loud, which proved that she was in a better mood. Snowy should be Dulan's ice supernatural power Herman, right? When Yan Yi was in elementary school, he and Herman were at the same table. Every day he came back from school, he would scold \u201cthat annoyance at the same table\u201d several times.\u201cDuring my self-study, he knocked on the stationery box and said it was a drum set?\u201d\u201cTake my clarinet apart and say he wants to form an orchestra?\u201d\u201cEvery day, I hear ghosts in my ears saying that he was singing a song?\u201d\u201cIs that bear mentally retarded? I suffered. No more! I euphemistically talked to him and he didn't understand at all, and asked me if I wanted to form a band together! I want to change tables!\u201dFor Yan Yi, who was strictly educated at home to be a noble, he was unorganized and uncultured. Herman, who didn't understand any noble language, was his nemesis. Yan Tong smiled and cried, covering her face. She was useless and couldn't protect her brother. Fortunately, her brother followed a good boss.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhh there is no more! The spirit fruit dessert is gone!The three fluffy dumplings instantly stiffened, and Arthur immediately rushed to Mingyou's feet, climbed up his trouser legs, and squatted on Mingyou's shoulders: \u201cI didn't do anything, don't worry about me, meow.\u201dMingyou couldn't help but laugh when there was a meow sound in the words conveyed by Arthur. He lightly flicked Arthur's forehead: \u201cYou are the worst.\u201d Arthur laughed triumphantly. Obviously Mingyou was complimenting him.Mingyou picked up the little white bear and little gray wolf, and soothed them one by one: \u201cNo fights are allowed, everyone should get along.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cWow.\u201d The\u00a0 little white bear and little gray wolf's sounds warmed Mingyou's heart. Any used up nutrition cubes at this time would not be counted.Mingyou put the three fluffies on the piano stand, and finally started live broadcasting. \u201cBlacky told me play the piano today. I don't play the piano well though. I hope you don't dislike it.\u201dMingyou prepared the seventh song in Robert Schumann's suite. \u201cFantasy\u201d could be used to express remembrance and yearning for love, family affection and friendship, as well as the longing for a better life. Mingyou figured this song should be very suitable for the spirit beasts and their partners who had experienced the battlefield.Mingyou tapped the keys with his fingers, and the light blue energy fluctuations from his body spread to every corner of the music room along with the melodious piano sound, gently soothing the spirits of the audience watching the live broadcast.This was always the case. Whether it was live cooking, making toys, or playing the piano, the little anchor would always calm their hearts in an instant, as if they had returned to the most comfortable and quiet environment. His Majesty the Emperor closed his eyes, and the golden lion's face showed a peaceful sleep.\u201cDang-dang-dang-kang-kang!\u201d A series of noises interrupted the emperor's meditation, and he impatiently raised his head.\u201cAh! Grey, don't step or sit on the keys.\u201d Mingyou hugged the little gray wolf and said embarrassedly, \u201cLet's continue.\u201d The melodious melody sounded.\u201cKang ding jingle!\u201d\u201cEh eh eh! Grey, don't play on the keys! Get down. Blacky, why are you here too?! Don't dance on the keys! Grey, Blacky, dancing on the piano is not okay! \u201d The small polar bear had a dull expression and then ice erupted from his body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMingyou placed the ice covered kitten and wolf cub on the piano stand, moved a chair beside him, and put a stool on the chair. He placed the little white bear on the stool and let him sit up to the height of the piano keys.Mingyou smiled at the camera: \u201cOkay, the commotion has been resolved, everyone, please continue to listen to the piano music.\u201dThe bear cub waved a paw and smiled with his eyes, looking like a little girl's favorite teddy bear. The audience couldn't sleep at all. Wait\u2026 What the anchor just said was degeneration, right? It was degradation, not evolution, right? Why could he still use abilities when in child form? Was it so easy to use abilities?No, they were not surprised by this. Just now the anchor and the little cat and wolf were attacked by an ice-type ability, right? Why did the kitten and wolf cub, who were spirit beasts, become ice sculptures, but the anchor only shivered?How could Colonel Herman's superb ability only affect the cat and wolf in the arms of the anchor, but didn't hurt the anchor? Was it so awesome? How was this possible! That was obviously an indiscriminate ranged attack! They were not blind!The melody of the piano music played by Mingyou was very gentle, like a little butterfly dancing in the warm spring sun. Everywhere one looked, the garden was full of spring imagery. But the hearts of the audience were refreshed.They looked at the two animal ice sculptures on the piano stand, then looked at Mingyou's gentle face and the well-behaved little polar bear.Shaking\u2026 It was amazing! No wonder the little anchor could take care of His Royal Highness and the ten heroes alone. Could his defensive power be comparable to this group of S-level abilities? The song ended. Mingyou asked the little polar bear who could see the barrage, what was the audience's opinion.The little bear's tender voice sounded in Mingyou's mind: \u201cThe audience said cold.\u201dCold? Mingyou didn't quite understand. The polar bear cub understood, but he didn't want to say anything. Little Mingyou was so gentle and lovely, where was he scary? Were these people, blind and needed glasses?\u201cThey probably want to listen to some more passionate music.\u201d Dabai said.Mingyou nodded, thinking about what to play next, while looking at the two ice sculptures on the piano stand: \u201cShould they be released?\u201dThe polar bear cub said, \u201cThey won't be hurt.\u201dMingyou whispered, \u201cBut I'm afraid they will catch a cold.\u201dLittle bear refuted, \u201cIt's fine to drink medicine if they get a cold.\u201d In short! He was so angry now! Resolutely refused to let them out. Seeing that the polar bear was really angry, Mingyou did not continue to persuade him. Although he felt sorry for Dahei and Dahui, these two actually jumped and danced on Dabai's treasured piano, which should indeed be scolded.Even if they broke their own things, Mingyou wouldn't be angry. But knowing that the piano was a very important thing that Dabai loved, these two still refused to listen. Therefore getting frozen for a while could be considered a sort of time-out. When the two of them came out of the ice sculpture, Mingyou fed them a bowl of ginger soup to warm their bodies.\u201cIt needs some more passion\u2026 Then \u201cSong of Sorrow\u201d is good.\u201d Mingyou didn't know much about Star Alliance music. Although he had a piano, the Tan family did not specifically hire a music teacher for him, or even allow him to connect to the star network.So after he got the piano, he just played the songs he knew in his previous life over and over again. But music was a transformational language without borders. Mingyou believed that people from the Star Alliance would understand the feelings in \u201cSonata Pathetique\u201d. In particular the third movement of the piano sonata.\u201cThe composer of \u201cSonata Pathetique\u201d is Beethoven, a talented musician.\u201d Mingyou introduced the origin of this piano piece that was world-famous in his time.Beethoven was less than thirty years old when he composed this piece, and both his age and his career were at his peak. However, when he wrote \u201cSonata Pathetique\u201d, it was not the feelings of a young man who forcing himself forward. At that time, his ears were gradually going deaf.For a musician who had just entered the peak of his career, his ears going deaf would shatter his world. But this song gave people the feeling that it was more about praising heroes and courage. The name was \u201cSonata Pathetique\u201d, but there was no sadness and decadence.Fight, fight! Every note was fighting! Every beat was pounding! It was like a person who was about to be pulled into hell, even if half of his body had been burned, he still had to raise his arms and fight against the sky!Even though his hearing continued to decline, even after his hearing was completely lost, Beethoven did not give up on music until his death. He put a stick on the piano resonance box and continued his music career by relying on his intuition and vibrations of sound.\u201cSonata Pathetique\u201d was the beginning of his suffering, the beginning of his struggle, and the beginning of his glory. When he was completely deaf, his music career reached its peak accompanied by suffering and resistance.\u201cThe Ninth Symphony\u201d, Beethoven's work after his complete deafness, was his greatest masterpiece. Eternal! Immortal! And now, Mingyou was playing the beginning of the composer's harsh journey towards the peak.It was sad. It was tragic. But not a tragic song. It was the beginning of a hero's song. With the brief introduction over, Mingyou finally found the feel and began to play.He played this song many times in school. He was soft, but didn't want to be cowardly. He was humble, but yearning for heroics; no matter if he was immersed in a fantasy, as long as he could climb out of disappointment and despair, as long as he could return to the sun, all means of self-help were not shameless.Didn't the hero imagine that he would become a hero when he grew up? Did those thoughts called secondary disease really disappear with age? The chairman of the game company who gave him a special account in the game world encouraged him not to give up his life and told him that men and women could be boys and girls until they die.This song was dedicated to all the real heroes and their families in the live broadcast room, as well as to those with \u201ceighth grade syndrome\u201d who were dreaming of becoming a hero like himself.Even if objective conditions did not allow it, as long as they had the idea of saving the world in their heart, they would definitely be able to work towards that goal in their actions. From studying and working hard, to being kind and being helpful to others, all actions that could make themself better, weren't they actions that made the world a better place?As long as efforts are made, dreams are not shameful daydreams. An unreachable goal was still a goal. Mingyou felt many emotions every time he played \u201cSonata Pathetique\u201d. His feelings were amplified by his surging emotional waves and conveyed to every listener's heart.His Majesty the golden lion king was dozing off when suddenly, it was as if his brother shouted into his ear, \u201cSleep, are you paralyzed!\u201d He was so startled that his soft golden fur stood on end. The piano score titled \u201cSonata Pathetique\u201d did contain deep sadness and despair, but pressed under his feet. Even if he was in purgatory, his heart would never give in.His Majesty closed his eyes again. Scenes of past despair appeared before his eyes, and this sadness reached its peak when he saw his younger brother who could not restore his human form.But as described in the song, even if he was desperate, he couldn't stop the struggle, because stopping meant that he would be completely plunged into the quagmire of despair, and there was no hope of survival. Regardless of his dignity or his love for his family and hometown, His Majesty will not lower his noble head.Before leaving, his brother, who had never listened to his words, made a funny and exaggerated expression and told him: \u201cBrother, even if I die, don't lower your head. The crown will fall and the enemy will laugh.\u201dIn the military camp, many soldiers who wanted to watch the live broadcast to have a good night's sleep, all accidentally floofed their hair, and the special camp was full of super fluffy dumplings.Even the S-rank supernatural beings who had just transformed into beasts had experienced wars-in those wars, spirit beasts were not the only ones fighting. Among those who died, not only were there S-rank abilities, but there were also many ordinary soldiers.There were many forms of sacrifice, like when an ordinary fleet was surrounded by Zerg. The soldiers used mechas and rushed towards the Zerg frigate, tearing themselves apart while damaging the opponent's frigate, allowing the commander to drive the flagship towards the other side. In the ambush, the flagship used the same sacrifice and fearlessness to achieve the \u201cvictory\u201d of trading less for more.Among those who had experienced war, who had not encountered difficulties and despair? Whose soul was scarred with marks that could not be erased forever?But the Star Alliance could fight back despite the desperate situation and obtain unexpectedly brilliant results. After the war, should they let themselves, their comrades-in-arms, their families, and their hometown fall into despair because of the evil intentions of demonic ambitions of a few people?Except for Prince Arthur's privately owned spiritual beast sanatorium, which took an random number name, other spiritual beast sanatoriums all had auspicious names. Many of these nursing homes housed spirit beasts that had been seriously injured and could not restore their human form.Although their condition was not as serious as the ten heroes and there was hope of a cure, many of them were destined to have life-long disabilities. Some may even retire from the ranks of superpowers and become ordinary people.They had been desperate and painful, but no one had thought about seeking death. No, they didn't think about it, they were just waiting for news from Prince Arthur.Victory was finally won, how could the person they hate the most seek the fruits of victory? Whether Prince Arthur was dead or alive, they would live until the day when the truth of the war was announced, for when the people who stabbed them in the back during the war would be held accounted for.They were all heroes, and they were living evidence. As long as they were alive, history could not be arbitrarily changed. Even if Prince Arthur died, they must obey Prince Arthur's last wish: unite with His Majesty, and make their last contribution for the protection of the Star Alliance.They protected Star Alliance from outside harassment, and they never allowed internal moths to destroy the peace that their comrades had spent their lives for while the Star Alliance's vitality was severely injured.This was the only request that His Royal Highness made to them before he left. Now that His Royal Highness was back, he was still optimistic and lively in the live broadcast, just like on the battlefield. His Highness's self-confidence and optimism was like the sun in everyone's mind. As long as Prince Arthur was there, they believed that victory would belong to them.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThey could cheer up a little more, they would live a little longer, and wait until His Royal Highness Arthur fully recovered. When His Royal Highness stood before the public again, they could rest in peace. The badly injured spirit beasts thought so. But when they heard \u201cSonata Pathetique\u201d, the spirit beasts who were lame, blind, or even missing half of their body hesitated.There were many livable planets in the Star Alliance, and there were other interstellar civilizations outside. They had never heard of this musician from an unknown little planet. But according to the little anchor, when this musician suffered from a disease where all the Star Alliance's technology could not allow him to hear, didn't the musician lose everything?For musicians, sound was not just one of their senses, it was their everything. Only by relying on his intuition and a small stick, this person could continue his dream. What about them?There were prosthetic limbs for lame legs, false eyes for the blind, and a mecha could be used even if the body is paralyzed. Even if they lost their power in the end, couldn't they continue to live as an ordinary person?The majority of the people in the Star Alliance were ordinary people, and there were many ordinary people among the soldiers who died on the battlefield-they were generally part of logistics or mechanics, but they still didn't fear sacrifice, and they were well-deserved heroes.If they had the intention of seeking death before, it was because they didn't want the Star Alliance to waste the resources on themselves as a useless person, but the anchor who called himself a 'spiritual beast master\u201d brought news. Groundbreaking spirit beast cultivation knowledge, perhaps the Star Alliance would no longer be short of resources for cultivating people with supernatural powers in the future.Since giving up was no longer a sacrifice, but a cowardly suicide, they had no reason to give up. Just like this piano piece, \u201cSonata Pathetique\u201d was only the beginning to suffering and subsequent glory. They were able to walk out of the sea of war and blood, how could they fall before dawn?The saying it was darkest before dawn? Their sun was still there! Their sun also carried a small star that heralded the approaching dawn, encouraging them not to fall before the light came. At this moment, the dying spirit beast struggled to get up and crawled towards the food bowl.They didn't want to indulge in the quiet atmosphere of the live broadcast room to sleep peacefully, they wanted to stay awake. Eat more, so they would have more energy to move towards the dawn.When the staff of the spirit beast nursing homes saw the surveillance monitoring data, and when they saw the anorexic spirit beasts enduring nausea and eating, they couldn't help hugging the people around them and shouting with excitement. As long as they could eat, the spirit beasts had the desire to live! They saw hope!\u201cHis Royal Highness's live broadcast room is too powerful, that little anchor is really too powerful!\u201d The dean of a spirit beast sanatorium took off his reading glasses and murmured with tears.\u201cThe spirit beast master is really amazing, and I really want to be like that.\u201d A young man said with emotion.Another added, \u201cDefinitely. Even without the special abilities of a spirit beast master, as long as we learn, we will definitely be able to deploy the spirit beast food and medicine in the live broadcast room.\u201dThe old dean nodded: \u201cWe learned knowledge from the live broadcast. After improving the existing treatment methods in the sanatorium, good results have been achieved.\u201dBefore, they isolated the spirit beasts and raised them like wild beasts. Now they were trying to carefully communicate with the spirit beasts under the premise of taking safety precautions. They found that although most of the spirit beasts had no previous memories, they were very friendly to humans who had good intentions towards them and got along well with them.The spirit beasts were even more sensitive to human emotions than when they were still human. They could always pick out the one who was the kindest and who had the deepest affection for them and was sticky. For example, the old dean was deeply loved by all spirit beasts.The old dean was already reporting to the above, applying to change the way family members visited, so that family members could also join in the treatment process. Although there were garbage family members, for most people, family was still one of the pillars of the soul.\u201cWhy doesn't His Majesty let the anchor give us lessons directly?\u201d Someone did not understand, \u201cWe can't directly ask questions to the anchor, and many things cannot be answered.\u201d\u201cThis is the protection of His Majesty and the prince for the young anchor. Before His Highness's body has recovered enough to appear in public, it's better not to be disturbed by other people.\u201d The old dean said, \u201cAnd the anchor is young and has little qualifications. If he enters academia in the usual way, he will be going in blind. There are industry rules, he will definitely suffer a lot of grievances, the results have to be recognized by the public, and there will be many detours.\u201d\u201cBut a live broadcast is different. The audience thinks that the anchor speaks well, and they try according to what the anchor said. This is not the same as academics. It doesn't matter if he's in the public eye, the academic community can't control it.\u201d The old dean laughed, \u201cThis live broadcast platform can be watched by all senior leaders in the Star Alliance, S-level abilities of the Star Alliance, their families, and related personnel of spiritual beast cultivation. It is a semi-public live platform.\u201dSemi-public meant a lot of viewers were online, from all walks of life, who would be able to manage them all. This was not a publicly broadcast platform for ordinary people, so dissenters could not wantonly smear and slander.\u201cI guess His Majesty's next move is to wait for the other spirit beast sanatoriums to imitate the anchors' practices and achieve good results, and then let the anchors appear in public with conclusive research examples, go beyond the academic world. Become the new spokesperson of the spirit beast cultivation world.\u201d\u201cFundamentally destroy the group of ignorant scholars in the spirit beast cultivation world!\u201dAfter Mingyou finished playing the piano, he suddenly felt dizzy. The little bear immediately became a big polar bear to catch the dizzy Mingyou.\u201cUh\u2026why are you spinning in circles, Dabai?\u201d Mingyou stupidly asked.\u201cI am not going around in circles.\u201d The polar bear hugged Mingyou, and the youth shrunk into the bear's warm and fluffy fur. He felt like the world was spinning like a drunk.He had never been drunk. It was said that when one was drunk, the world was spinning. Should this be the feeling? The polar bear removed the ice from the little cat and wolf, and the two little fluffy creatures immediately shook like quails splashed with water, and they sneezed.\u201cSpray any saliva on the piano, and you two will continue to be ice sculptures.\u201d The white bear threatened.The black kitten immediately jumped on the spot, leaped on the polar bear's shoulder, and warmed up with the white bear's fur. The little gray wolf also pounced on the other shoulder. He opened his mouth and bit down on the bear's shoulder with a whimper and hung on. The polar bear glanced at the little wolf who was inexplicably hostile to him, and ignored the provocation.Arthur shivered and cut off the live broadcast. The excited audience members were kicked out of the live broadcast room before they could react. They were so angry that many fluffies howled at the window like a wolf on a full moon night. Even His Majesty the golden lion, who didn't like to yell very much, angrily uttered a series of foul curses.This bastard brother! He hadn't eaten any nutrition cubes today! Before closing the live broadcast, have a few nutrition cubes! He was looking forward to tasting the nutrition cubes! The snacks were in front of him!Angry! His Majesty decided to take some time to visit the nursing home in person to train his growing younger brother!\u201cIs he okay? Do you want me to call a doctor?\u201d Arthur wanted to become a large cat, but there was a polar bear, and the two plushies were squeezed together instead of moving, so he stayed in the form of a kitten, squatting next to the pillow and guarding Mingyou.\u201cHis emotions are too intense, and the mental power is too active, which leads to physical discomfort. A common problem among those with supernatural powers.\u201d Dabai looked at the diagnosis report from the treatment robot and said, \u201cWhen he stabilizes his emotions, he will need some rest. \u201c\u201cYou can make yourself faint by playing the piano. You are the stupidest idiot in the world.\u201d Seeing that Mingyou was okay, Arthur breathed a sigh of relief. He jumped onto Mingyou's forehead and kept tapping Mingyou's nose.\u201cI was wrong \u2026\u2026 ah \u2026\u2026I was wrong.\u201d Mingyou felt wronged, \u201cNothing happened when I played before?\u201d\u201cSpiritual power rapid growth will have this kind of adverse reaction, like a child getting growing pains. This is not a bad thing.\u201d The calm tone of the polar bear was like a clear spring, soothing Mingyou's inner anxiety, \u201cYou can play the piano, just take a break when you feel unwell.\u201d\u201cIs it useful for you to eat the nutrition cube we eat?\u201d Arthur warmed Mingyou's forehead with his fluffy belly, and relieved discomfort like a heat pack. \u201cMy nutrition cubes can be given to you.\u201dMingyou laughed: \u201cThank you Dahei, I don't think it will be useful. I have no problems, but I'm just a little sleepy, just sleep some more.\u201d\u201cThen go to bed.\u201d Arthur urged.After Mingyou fell asleep, the polar bear replaced the cat with a normal heat pack, picked up the little wolf who wanted to drill into Mingyou's bed and left the bedroom.\u201cToday, Mingyou's energy waves when playing the piano were too amazing.\u201d Three fluffy animals sat in a meeting, with the polar bear as the host.Arthur nodded: \u201cA thousand times stronger, compared to when our team attacked the Zerg nest, and the Zerg queen released a war aura.\u201dArthur opened his mouth and spit out a series of game terms, and the polar bear, who was used to his way of speaking, nodded: \u201cIf more spirit beasts can be cultivated, the combat effectiveness of the army will be greatly improved. We must protect Mingyou.\u201d\u201cDoes the war aura have anything to do with our protection of him?\u201d Arthur licked his paws, and washed his face, \u201cDabai, you are really utilitarian.\u201d The polar bear wanted to slap the black cat to death. Did he mean this? He just emphasized Mingyou's greatness!\u201cI suggest picking up our other comrades as soon as possible.\u201d After hearing the two's words, the little wolf expressed his opinion, \u201cMingyou's power is too special, and His Majesty can't resist public pressure for too long. Mingyou will soon be forced to appear in front of the public. The more people who can protect him, the better.\u201d\u201cYes. I don't believe the eleven of us can't protect one silly youth.\u201d A pause, and then Arthur hunched back and jumped on the spot like a startled animal, \u201cMeow?! Stupid wolf, did you wake up?!!!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A refreshing fragrance wafted out\u2014there was a trace of Spiritual Force in the tea. It wasn't the lowest grade tea either. Ming Alliance of Merchants sure was generous.She took a sip and the scent of tea lingered in her mouth\u2014it had been so long since she drank any Spiritual Tea.This tea was very much inferior to the Spiritual Tea Lou Mu Yan had tasted before, but she didn't dislike it at all. She was famous as a tea lover back in the Immortal Cultivation World.\u201cThis Spiritual Tea is pretty good. When the auction's over, I better ask to buy some from Shopkeeper Lu. My grandpa loves this.\u201d Xiao Zi Ang exclaimed after taking a few more sips of Spiritual Tea.Lu Mu Yan smiled lightly and asked: \u201cThis Spiritual Tea is also sold by the Ming Alliance of Merchants?\u201d\u201cThe Spiritual Tea isn't sold publicly. But if you have some connections, then you could still obtain some.\u201d Yun Lan's slender fingertips rubbed the celadon cup, then raised his eyes, \u201cIf Mu Yan wants, then I can get some for you.\u201d\u201cThen thank you, cousin.\u201d Lou Mu Yan thanked him without restraint. She really liked this Spiritual Tea, so she'll remember this personal favour.\u201cWe're a family, there's no need for formalities.\u201d Yun Lan smiled and shook his head.His Empress Mother really loved Lou Mu Yan, even if she used to be known as the trash of the Imperial Capital and had an overbearing and dislikeable personality. His Empress Mother never lessened her doting on Lou Mu Yan.Lou Mu Yan also remembered how her Empress aunt truly did love her a lot, not to mention even though Yun Lan wasn't close to her, he never bullied her, and instead, protected her even when he didn't want to. Such relatives were rare and precious, so she should become more familiar with him in the future.As the auction hadn't started yet, they chatted idly, but soon they heard a knock on the door.Yun Lan gave the guard behind him a look, and the person walked over to open the private room door.There, a beautiful woman with a gentle temperament in a rose-red palace dress entered, bringing a few others. Amongst them were Gu Yan Ran and Zeng Rou.When the two saw Lou Mu Yan, they were surprised. Zeng Rou's dislike was written all over her face, while Gu Yan Ran concealed her resentment.They didn't expect this trash would be with the Third Prince and his group. They didn't dare to offend any of the people here, so they didn't ridicule Lou Mu Yan for the time being.When Lou Mu Yan saw the two of them, she fell into thought, but didn't say anything and only sat there quietly with her teacup.\u201cBrother Third Prince, Brother Fifth Prince, Fourth Cousin, Young Sir Xiao, Young Sir Chi.\u201d When she saw Lou Mu Yan's, surprised flashed in her eyes, then she smiled at her and said: \u201cYoung Miss Lou.\u201c\u201cSeventh Princess.\u201d Lou Mu Yan replied with a faint smile.The Seventh Princess was Imperial Noble Consort Hui's daughter, and was in the Heaven Class of the Imperial Academy. They didn't have a lot of interactions, but neither did she bully her like Gu Yan Ran and her group did. In the palace, the Seventh Princess's mother had a good relationship with Gu Yan Ran's elder sister, but she wouldn't offend the Empress either\u2014she was rather skilful in that aspect.Yun Lan and the others smiled and nodded in greeting to Seventh Princess Yun Xin. She usually knew how to conduct herself and none of them disliked her.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksYun Xin also had her own private room, but after hearing that Yun Lan and his group arrived, she brought Gu Yan Ran and the others over for a greeting.\u201cThird Prince, Fifth Prince\u2026\u201d Gu Yan Ran and Zeng Rou also stepped forward to greet the rest, but they both ignored Lou Mu Yan.Lu Mu Yan didn't care either. She was indifferent without any ripples of emotion in her eyes.\u201cYi Xuan, you also came to participate in the auction.\u201d Gu Yan Ran smiled softly. Her voice was smooth like water, and she looked at Chi Yi Xuan lovingly.Chi Yi Xuan furrowed his brows subconsciously. In the past, he wasn't as disgusted by Gu Yan Ran's fake tenderness, but for some reason, he disliked it today. He nodded coldly: \u201cYes.\u201dGu Yan Ran froze, and a sourness rose in her heart.When she entered just now and saw Lou Mu Yan here, she already felt uncomfortable. Why should this trash be here\u2014it was only because she was born lucky. If she didn't have the General's Mansion, then this trash wouldn't have been anything. She could step on her all she wanted.Yun Xin felt Gu Yan Ran's mood fluctuate, and even had a feeling of resentment. She was a little disappointed inside. Compared with Imperial Noble Consort Gu, Gu Yan Ran's schemes were lacking too much. Even compared with the current Lou Mu Yan, her tolerance was lacking too.With Zeng Rou's status, she wouldn't have been able to participate in such an auction. She was only able to participate because of her relationship with Gu Yan Ran, and because she gifted the princess a valuable present and asked to be given a chance. So she could only glare at Lou Mu Yan and say nothing.\u201cThe auction is about to start. I'll return to my private room now.\u201d Yun Xin really couldn't stand Zeng Rou being this way, and she regretted agreeing to bring her.She liked Lou Mu Bai, so she didn't want to become enemies with her. To prevent any conflict, it was best to leave.\u201cSure, you may go.\u201d Yun Lan also didn't like Gu Yan Ran and Zeng Rou, so he simply nodded.Gu Yan Ran endured the grievances in her heart and looked at Chi Yi Xuan affectionately, hoping that he could allow her to remain. She didn't want Lou Mu Yan and Chi Yi Xuan to remain alone together, but her beloved appeared to not even see her amorous gaze, only looking down, staring at the tea set.\u201cLet's go.\u201d Yun Xin furrowed her eyebrows and warned Gu Yan Ran with her eyes. This wasn't the type to express love at all\u2014this woman's brain was becoming more and more useless. As expected from the schemes of someone who came from a small, lowly family.A thin mist rose in Gu Yan Ran's eyes. Seeing that Chi Yi Xuan still had no intention of letting her stay, she could only stomp her foot, endure the grievance, and leave with the Seventh Princess. She looked like a tearful flower.\u201cYi Xuan, your little wife's full of grievance, aren't you going to chase after her and comfort her? Or bring her back and sit for a bit?\u201d Yun Jin smiled and joked as if he feared there wasn't enough chaos in the world1.Chi Yi Xuan didn't say a word, but he looked up coldly at Yun Jin, an evident look of displeasure.Seeing Chi Yi Xuan's cold face, Yun Jin shrugged, then glanced at Lou Mu Yan who had been indifferent this entire time with only a slight curve of interest on her lips.Chi Yi Xuan also looked at Lou Mu Yan in his peripheral vision and saw that she was drinking tea leisurely without any response. He suddenly felt sour, but he quickly adjusted his emotions. Except, he felt an inexplicable resentment towards Gu Yan Ran.He allowed his family to arrange her as his concubine because she was obedient, but seeing how restless and impure she was now, he suddenly felt that he needed to carefully consider whether or not to marry this woman in as a decoration2.1does things as he pleases2marry her just for the sake of it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Yun Lan frowned unconsciously and the guard standing behind him immediately opened the door.Shopkeeper Lu entered with the Seventh Princess and her company and said with a smile: \u201cThird Prince, just now a very distinguished guest came to participate in the auction, but he wanted his own private room. The superiors of the Imperial Family decided that the private room for the Seventh Princess was to be made available, so is it possible for the Princess and her company to share this private room with you?\u201dShopkeeper Lu had no other choice. He couldn't offend that distinguished guest and five of the private rooms for distinguished guest were booked by the Royal Family, so he could only go and negotiate with them. Their answer was to give the private room of the Seventh Princess to that distinguished guest, so he had to come forward to coordinate.\u201cWho is this very distinguished guest?\u201d Yun Luo asked aloud what everyone wondered.Shopkeeper Lu thought for a while and said: \u201cA Sword Monarch expert. As for the rest, please forgive this one for being unable to answer.\u201dSolemnity filled the room, and they didn't ask anymore.After they agreed, Shopkeeper Lu asked the attendants to add a few more chairs. As the private room was designed to be relatively large, adding a few more seats for the Seventh Princess and her company didn't make it feel any more crowded.\u201cSorry to bother Brother Third Prince.\u201d Yun Xin managed a smile. She felt very uncomfortable about the situation, but that person wasn't someone she could offend, so she could only bear it.Yun Lan smiled softly and shook his head, saying: \u201cNo matter.\u201d Adding a few more people was nothing.Yun Xin took Gu Yan Ran, Zeng Rou and two other women to sit down, then the auction officially started.On the auction stage, an elegant middle-aged man entered with a gentle smile.\u201cToday is the triennial auction. I am Ni Jun, today's auctioneer. Everyone knows the credibility of our Alliance, and I believe that the auction this time won't disappoint everyone either.\u201dNi Jun paused, then continued: \u201cToday the auction also deliberately added three finale items, all of which are rare and of the finest quality. So everyone must seize the opportunity.Seeing that most of the people below displayed looks of anticipation and excitement, he said with a smile: \u201cI presume everyone can't wait any longer, so I won't say anymore. Let the auction officially begin now. Let's auction the first item.\u201dNi Jun clapped his hands, and a young woman walked out holding a tray with a jade slip on it.\u201cThis is a Mortal Class Top-Grade manual suitable for wind attribute Sword Masters. Cultivating this technique can not only enhance the power of wind-based sword skills, but also build a defensive wall that could attack and defend, which is very rare.\u201d The auctioneer smiled, and after the introduction, he began to guide the people below to bid, \u201cIt starts at one hundred thousand black-gold coins.\u201dThe manuals on this land were divided into Mortal Class, Earth Class, Sky Class, Saint Class and Deity Class. Each class was divided into three grades: Top-Grade, Middle-Grade and Low-Grade.The Mortal Class Top-Grade manuals were vied for eagerly by Sword King Stage Sword Masters and below. Good manuals couldn't always be bought with money, and sometimes it was even impossible to find them, so being able to auction manuals was also a demonstration of the Ming Alliance of Merchant's vast resources.Lou Mu Yan wasn't interested in this manual, however. Even if a Sky Rank manual was presented to her, she wouldn't necessarily be interested.In her previous life, when she trained in her sect and explored numerous Secret Realms, she obtained many copies of manuals that would make numerous cultivators crazy. Now, those manuals still existed in her Sea of Consciousness, and was also a valuable asset.She was still going to practice the manuals from her precious life as they weren't only the most suitable for her, but it also prevented her from taking a lot of detours.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksLou Mu Yan was calm, but Gu Yan Ran couldn't remain calm. She was a Sword Master with the wind attribute and the best manual in the Gu Clan was Mortal Class Middle-Grade. A fire of desire burned in her eyes, and she clenched her fists\u2014she must obtain this manual.\u201cFive hundred thousand.\u201d When the price for the manual reached three hundred and fifty thousand, Gu Yan Ran directly raised the price.Gu Yan Ran's Clan was the richest clan in the Empire, so she had strong financial strength. Even the Lou Clan couldn't compare, but the Lou Clan's true worth was something that the Gu Clan couldn't compare to. That's why even though Imperial Noble Consort Gu was very arrogant in the palace, she couldn't supersede the Empress.This time, as Gu Yan Ran participated in the auction, the Gu Clan gave her eight million black-gold coins. Even the core children and disciples of old distinguished families of the Empire couldn't take out this figure of money. It was enough for her to be proud of.Yun Lan casually glanced at the excited and proud Gu Yan Ran. His eyes darkened and looked at Lou Mu Yan: \u201cDoes Mu Yan not want this manual? I remember you also cultivated wind attribute skills. If you like it, I'll bid for it and gift it to you.\u201dLou Mu Yan was taken aback for a moment, then her heart warmed, and she glanced at Gu Yan Ran in her peripheral vision whose expression immediately changed. She shook her head, uninterested: \u201cThank you cousin, but there's no need. I'm not interested.\u201dShe wasn't so bored as to act on impulse and contend for this manual with Gu Yan Ran, wasting Yun Lan's black-gold coins.Gu Yan Ran felt relieved when she heard Lou Mu Yan wasn't interested, but she also felt unpleasant. Why did it feel like she was picking up an insignificant manual that the trash didn't want? A vicious look crossed her eyes\u2014after the Academy's annual competition, she would definitely step on Lou Mu Yan.In the end, the wind attribute skill was bought by Gu Yan Ran with the price of three million black-gold coins.After that, six or seven more items were auctioned one after another, but Lou Mu Yan wasn't interested in any of them, and not a single person bid for them in the private room.It wasn't until the auctioneer unveiled a piece of red cloth, revealing a small, dark blue cauldron did she straightened up in her seat, her eyes bright.\u201cThis is a cauldron left behind by a senior Grade 4 Alchemist, and this cauldron is a High-Quality Spirit Tool. It could withstand the internal fire of a Sword Monarch Stage expert and could even increase the rate of pills refined. I believe everyone understands how valuable it is for Alchemists without me saying anymore.\u201dThough Ni Jun saw that most people revealed uninterested expressions, he didn't mind. Alchemists were originally very rare professions, and it would be useless for anyone else to buy this cauldron. He turned the auction hammer and announced with a smile: \u201cThe starting price of the blue cauldron is three hundred thousand black-gold coins. The bid begins.\u201dLou Mu Yan discovered that the auctions held by the Ming Alliance of Merchants were indeed very high-class. The starting price was already three hundred thousand\u2014that was the income of many years for many clans in Yan'zhou Country.Then she discovered that she was rather poor\u2014the one million black-gold coins given by Ye Qing Han plus the money from the Lou Clan was only three million black-gold coins altogether. If she couldn't afford this, then she'd have to buy the cauldron by selling some of her things.\u201cThree million.\u201d Lu Mu Yan was too lazy to bid slowly, so she directly reported all her money.\u201cPU!\u201d Yun Jin couldn't stop himself from spitting out his Spiritual Tea, lifted his head and said: \u201cLou Mu Yan. You're ruthless.\u201dEven a spendthrift wouldn't waste money like this. What was a Sword Master buying an unusable cauldron for? And the very first bid was three million black-gold coins\u2014was the Lou Clan this rich? Why didn't he know\u2026\u201cLou Mu Yan, you're deliberately punishing me right?\u201d Xiao Zi Ang was just about to bid five hundred thousand when Lou Mu Yan beat him to it. He was really gloomy. What's all this about?Lou Mu Yan rolled her eyes at Xiao Zi Ang: \u201cWhat am I doing punishing you? I've got no bones to pick with you at all, I really just want to get this cauldron.\u201d\u201cThen I'm sorry, this cauldron is also very useful to me.\u201d Xiao Zi Ang shrugged, then bid 'three million five hundred thousand'.Lou Mu Yan knew it would be like this\u2014this blue cauldron was very tempting to Alchemists. But she didn't have a cauldron that was convenient for her to use right now, and this cauldron just met her requirements, so she could only bleed heavily1.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then I won't be polite.\u201d\u201cThree million six hundred thousand.\u201d Yun Lan nodded with a smile and joined the bid.\u201cFour million.\u201d Someone in the next room called.Xiao Zi Ang glared at Yun Lan: \u201cTrust you to discard your humanity for the opposite sex1.\u201d\u201cI remember that your Master gifted you a cauldron that's higher in grade than this one.\u201d Yun Lan raised his eyebrows, \u201cDon't think I don't know your hobby of collecting cauldrons. This cauldron is more important to Mu Yan, so naturally I'll choose her first.\u201d\u201cHow'd you know this cauldron is more important to her?\u201d Xiao Zi Ang rolled his eyes. \u201cShe only just managed to eradicate her Terminal Meridians constitution. Don't tell me she became an Alchemist in such a short amount of time.\u201d\u201cI believe in my cousin.\u201d Yun Lan played with the teacup in his hand and continued to bid: \u201cFour million five hundred thousand.\u201dXiao Zi Ang held his forehead. He didn't have a strong desire for this cauldron and did indeed only want to buy it for his collection. After all, this was a cauldron once used by that particular high-level Alchemist. But seeing that Yun Lan definitely wouldn't stop until he bought the cauldron, he also gave up.\u201cLou Mu Yan.\u201d Xiao Zi Ang tapped Lou Mu Yan's arm with a look of a child's curiosity, \u201cAs long as you tell me how you eradicated your Terminal Meridians constitution, then I won't bid against you, how about that?\u201dLou Mu Yan looked at him in amusement, \u201cIt's not like I'm paying for it, do whatever you want.\u201d She already caught Xiao Zi Ang's expression that revealed he wanted to give up the bidding, but now he wanted to elicit an answer from her? He was too young.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Xiao Zi Ang choked, then pouted in annoyance, but he still stopped bidding.\u201cFive million.\u201d The person in the next room called out another figure.\u201cFive million five hundred thousand.\u201d Yun Lan continued to increase the price, his expression unchanged.\u201cSix million.\u201d The other party continued.Yun Luo knew that Yun Lan still wanted to buy other things today, and he probably only brought around twenty million black-gold coins. If he used a third of it or even more for this cauldron, it was possible he would miss the other things he wanted.He couldn't help but remind him: \u201cThis price already exceeded the value of the cauldron, I think that's enough.\u201dYun Lan did want to buy other things, but he was one to keep his promises, so he wouldn't lose Lou Mu Yan's faith. If he missed the item he wanted, then it only meant they weren't fated. \u201cNo need, he probably reached his baseline now.\u201d\u201cSix million one hundred thousand.\u201d Yun Lan increased the price.As Yun Lan expected, the person in the private room next to them stopped bidding after hearing the price.Lou Mu Yan felt warm seeing Yun Lan continue to bid for the cauldron without hesitation.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksIn fact, she could see that Yun Lan did doubt her purpose of buying the cauldron, but he still supported her unconditionally. Regardless of why he trusted her, she would acknowledge this cousin.Seeing Lou Mu Yan's ecstatic appearance, Yun Luo sighed inwardly. He thought that she had changed, but he was afraid she probably only wanted to buy this cauldron to attract Chi Yi Xuan's attention.Gu Yan Ran and Zeng Rou exchanged looks and saw jealousy in each other's eyes. Why did this trash have this much luck? She didn't have money and yet she still had someone rush to help her. Why?However the two soon summed it up to family\u2014after all, the Empress loved the trash dearly, so it made sense that the Third Prince would be this generous to Lou Mu Yan.Although Yun Xin was surprised why her third brother, who was kind on the surface but cold on the inside, would regard Lou Mu Yan so favourably, but she still kept the gentle smile on her face as she did from the beginning.Chi Yi Xuan frowned and glanced at Lou Mu Yan in disapproval. It seemed she returned to her nature, still so wilful.Yun Jin simply had the mentality to watch a good show. He felt that Lou Mu Yan would shock them once again.After a few more items were auctioned off, some people in their private room began to bid as well. Chi Yi Xuan, Yun Luo and the Seventh Princess each took one item, and the price reached over ten million black-gold coins each.Another few auctions later, Ni Jun took a palm-sized shield from his attendant and his eyes unconsciously revealed some excitement, \u201cThis shield was created by the Great Master Yan \u00a0and is a Peak-Quality Spirit Tool.\u201d\u201cWow!!\u201d An uproar stirred from the people below when they heard Great Master Yan's name.Who was Great Master Yan? He was one of Tian'ling Continent's greatest high-level Smiths, and once refined a Saint Treasure that even Sword Sovereign Stage experts vied for in bloody battles.But it was unfortunate that after Great Master Yan entered a Secret Realm, he never returned. Whether he was alive or dead was uncertain, but many guessed that he was probably dead, which was a pity.Lou Mu Yan didn't pay attention to the excitement of the people around her. She focused her attention on the small yellow shield.'There's something suspicious!' That was her first feeling, so she spread her Spiritual Sense and tentatively slipped into the shield.The moment she touched the small shield, a roar from a Vicious Beast entered her brain and confronted her Spiritual Sense. If it weren't that her Mental Energy was very strong, this sound would definitely cause an internal injury.Ni Jun gestured for everyone to silence, and the people in the audience immediately hushed, all staring at the palm-sized shield fervently.\u201cSince this shield was made by Great Master Yan, then its value should belong in the category of the finale items, right? To auction it now, does it possibly have any defects?\u201d A hoarse, aged voice questioned from a private room opposite Lou Mu Yan and her company's.\u201cIt's that Sword Monarch expert.\u201d Yun Xin couldn't help but say. That was the private room she was in before.As expected from a professional auctioneer, Ni Jun not only didn't feel any dissatisfaction from their questioning, but also took the opportunity to say what he originally wanted to say.\u201cThis distinguished guest is right. Although this shield is a Peak-Quality Spirit Tool created by Great Master Yan, but it does have a defect, and it's that you couldn't use your Elemental Energy to control its size and confront the enemy.\u201dWhile Ni Jun spoke, he channelled some of his Elemental Energy into the small shield. It spun around in his hand, then a yellow light instantly enveloped the shield. Just when everyone waited for it to display it's power, there was no longer any reactions.\u201cThis shield has also been tried by several Sword King Appraisers from our Ming Alliance of Merchants, but it was the same response as this.\u201d Ni Jun retrieved his Elemental Energy, and the shield returned its original appearance, \u201cTherefore, several Appraisers from our Ming Alliance of Merchants agreed that it was only suitable for a fated person. If that person could control this shield, then its defence could definitely withstand one blow from a Sword Monarch expert.\u201dLou Mu Yan's lips curled slightly. Suitable for a fated person? Those Sword King Appraisers probably didn't even discover the Soul of a Vicious Beast hidden within the small shield.1popular Chinese colloquial saying.

What was the use of obtaining a Peak-Quality Spirit Tool shield, but it wouldn't be used? Were they looking to abuse themselves?\u201cAccording to you, then it's useless for us to buy this shield!\u201d They wouldn't believe nonsense like it was only suitable for a fated one\u2014they only believed that this shield was faulty.\u201cThat's right. Then can we try whether we can use it before we buy it? If we can use it, then we'd buy it.\u201d Some people still held a great desire for this shield, so they wanted to try.Following, a series of doubts sounded from the seats, and there were also some who didn't want to give up and give the shield a try. If they could control it, then they'd buy it.Ni Jun seemed to have expected such a situation, so he said without rush: \u201cLetting those who want to buy it to try to use it was definitely impossible. This shield's value is indeed very high, and it's also true you would have to risk the possibility of being unable to use it. Whether you buy it or not is your choice, but our Ming Alliance of Merchants wouldn't joke with our reputation.\u201dThis shield was entrusted to them for auction by a regular client of theirs and he didn't allow potential buyers to test it. Besides, if someone decided to buy this shield, then they should bear the unforeseen risks. After all, it was a fortuitous opportunity if they bought it and could use it.Due to the strength of the Ming Alliance of Merchants, even though Ni Jun's words made some people unsatisfied, but no one dared provoke him. The result would only be death.\u201cThe value of this shield depends on what you personally feel it's worth. We'll start the bid now. The starting price is five hundred thousand black-gold coins.\u201d Ni Jun quoted the minimum price. If this shield didn't have the defect, then the starting price definitely wouldn't be lower than three million black-gold coins.\u201cSix hundred thousand\u2026\u201d\u201cNine hundred thousand\u2026\u201dRegardless, it was still a peak-quality defence-type Spirit Tool, not to mention it was made by Great Master Yan, so many still participated in the bidding, but they had their individual baselines. If it exceeded it, then they'd stop.To them, it felt like food that was tasteless, yet was a pity to discard1.When the price reached nine million, Lou Mu Yan saw Yun Lan hesitating, tapping his finger on the table gently. She looked up and said: \u201cCousin, this shield is definitely worth it.\u201d\u201cLou Mu Yan, such a defective product isn't even worth spending ten million black-gold coins or more. There's still Spirit Tools to bid for later, A'Lan can definitely choose a more practical one.\u201d Seeing Lou Mu Yan instigate Yun Lan, Yun Luo frowned in displeasure, but his tone was still considered tactful.Lou Mu Yan's eyes overflowed with brightness. She didn't answer Yun Luo, but instead chuckled and turned to Yun Lan. \u201cCousin, you need to believe in your instincts.\u201dYun Lan was a little hesitant at first. He leaned towards buying the shield as that shield gave him a mysterious feeling, but what Yun Luo said was also the truth\u2014that's why he was tossing between to bid or not to bid.Now that he heard Lou Mu Yan's words, he suddenly became enlightened and bid: \u201cTen million.\u201d\u201cYun Lan, I say your head's full of water today2.\u201d Yun Luo said with a little displeasure\u2014Yun Lan was just unreasonable today, constantly accompanying Lou Mu Yan in her craziness.Yun Lan smiled helplessly. He knew that his cousin was doing this for his own good. But he also didn't know why, when he saw Lou Mu Yan radiate such self-confidence, he also inexplicably wanted to believe in her.\u201cTwelve million.\u201d A voice rang from another private room.\u201cThirteen million.\u201d Yun Lan followed.\u201cFourteen million.\u201d The other party still didn't give up.\u201cFifteen million.\u201d This was all the black-gold coins Yun Lan had on him today, but luckily, the other party stopped after hearing the price.In the end, Yun Lan won the bid for this shield for fifteen million black-gold coins. Chi Yi Xuan and Xiao Zi Ang both revealed a disapproval look, but since it was Yun Lan's choice, they didn't say anything. However, their understanding of Lou Mu Yan's wilfulness increased another layer.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksYun Jin had the opposite reaction to the others, however. He smiled merrily at Lou Mu Yan and asked: \u201cThere's something suspicious about this shield?\u201d\u201cSmart.\u201d Lu Mu Yan was rather surprised\u2014Yun Jin actually believed her as well. She was in a good mood, which was rare, as she nodded.\u201cWhat's suspicious about it? Let's hear it.\u201d Yun Jin continued to ask.\u201cYou'll know in a bit.\u201d Lou Mu Yan was too lazy to explain. Besides, when the people from the Ming Alliance of Merchants arrived with the shield, they'd know.The corner of Yun Jin's lips twitched. But he realised he'd know the answer soon, so he didn't pursue it.Ridicule flashed in Gu Yan Ran's eyes as she took delight in her coming misfortune\u2014as if she'd believe that there was anything suspicious about the shield. This was no doubt all a ruse to show something to Chi Yi Xuan. It was just that this stupid woman didn't know that Yi Xuan didn't like this sort of sloppy behaviour.Zeng Rou snorted, but when she saw Yun Lan cast a cold look at her, her smile quickly vanished and her hatred for Lou Mu Yan increased.Yun Luo and Xiao Zi Ang glanced at each other\u2014they didn't believe in Lou Mu Yan's words and only hoped Yun Lan would learn his lesson after this and stop spoiling his trash cousin unscrupulously.Lou Mu Yan saw everyone's expressions, but she didn't care. She only ever cared about people she valued, and the rest were nothing to her.When she glanced over to Yun Xin, she saw a gentle smile\u2014a sliver of interest rose in her eyes. This woman's scheming sure was deep. She didn't display either happiness or anger. As expected from a princess raised by the Imperial Family.After a while, a knock sounded on the door.The auction items of the Ming Alliance of Merchants were all inspected and paid for on-site with their crystal cards. One auction was divided into several rounds, and after one round, the auctioneer will announce a break of a quarter of an hour, then after the transactions of the items, they'd continue the next round.The person who sent the shield over was Shopkeeper Lu. Towards every superior in the Imperial Family of every country, the Ming Alliance of Merchants would all have secret ways of cooperation and contacts. Knowing Yun Lan was Yan'zhou Country's Emperor's favourite son, he naturally caught the attention of the person in charge of the Alliance in Yan'zhou Country.\u201cThird Prince, this is the Spirit Tool you won, please inspect it.\u201d Shopkeeper Lu took the tray from an attendant behind him and handed it to Yun Lan.Yun Lan nodded with a smile, \u201cWe've troubled Shopkeeper Lu to come in person.\u201dWhen saying that, he reached out and took the palm-sized shield from the tray. After channelling some Elemental Energy into it, the shield's reaction was the same as the demonstration by Ni Jun. Only a layer of light-yellow light surrounded the shield and there was no other response.Upon seeing this, Shopkeeper Lu smiled helplessly and reminded: \u201cThe shield was identified as a Peak-Quality Spirit Tool precisely because it couldn't be controlled. If the Third Prince could discover how to control it in private, then its level wouldn't simply be a Spirit Tool.\u201dThese kinds of auction items were just like that. It depended on luck. If one couldn't find a way to control it, then it would just be a burden. But if one did find a way, then its value was definitely several times higher, perhaps dozens of times higher than the auction price.\u201cNo worries. I can still bear this risk.\u201d Yun Lan's expression remained unchanged. He always felt that this shield wasn't that simple. After the auction was over, he could carefully examine it.\u201cLou Mu Yan, didn't you say that the shield was suspicious, so you got the Third Prince to win it?\u201d Zeng Rou jumped out after receiving Gu Yan Ran's look, \u201cNow that the Third Prince couldn't use this shield, then I trust you have a solution?\u201dAfter she said that, everyone cast their gazes onto Lou Mu Yan.Coldness flashed in Yun Lan's eyes. He saw Gu Yan Ran and Zeng Rou exchange glances just now. The Gu Clan had become more arrogant because the Imperial Noble Consort gained favour, while Zeng Rou dared to be so presumptuous\u2014their education was definitely horrible. It seemed that it was time for the Zeng Clan to change their head of the family.1idiom meaning it didn't have a lot of value, but they were reluctant to part with it.2equivalent to having a screw loose or one's head's not in the right place.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even if he couldn't use this shield, but he didn't blame her\u2014that was enough for her to act.\u201cCousin, show me the shield.\u201dYun Lan nodded and handed the small shield over to Lou Mu Yan. In order to not burden her, he added: \u201cLet everything flow with fate, there's no need to mind.\u201dLou Mu Yan smiled silently as she took the small shield in her hands. The Mental Energy she released earlier was still attached to the small shield and was confronting the Soul of the Vicious Beast.Yun Luo and the others stared at Lou Mu Yan to see what tricks she could play. Even Shopkeeper Lu didn't leave immediately after swiping the crystal card, and instead waited with curiosity in his eyes.Noticing the power of the Vicious Beast's Soul weakening slowly under her suppression, a sharp glint flashed in her eyes. She raised her left hand and began to draw with two fingers above the shield and traces of Spiritual Energy flowed with her movements like moving clouds and flowing water1, constructing a talisman that flashed with a white fluorescent light hovering in the air.\u201cSuppress!\u201dAs Lou Mu Yan's voice fell, the talisman drawn with Spiritual Energy instantly dashed down and entered the small shield in her hand.\u201cDrawing talismans in the void!\u201d Shopkeeper Lu couldn't help but exclaim with his eyes wide open. Then he realised he lost his composure, coughed to cover it up, but the shock that filled his heart hardly lessened.Drawing talismans in the void was something that could only be performed by Sword King experts that had slightly touched upon the laws of Heaven and earth, so when it was performed by Lou Mu Yan who was only at the Great Sword Master Stage, he couldn't help but lose himself.Hearing Shopkeeper Lu's exclamation, apart from Gu Yan Ran and Zeng Rou who didn't know about drawing talismans in the void, the rest looked at Lou Mu Yan in utter shock.Lou Mu Yan wasn't distracted because of Shopkeeper Lu's loss of composure. She continued to chant a few more sentences and characters that contained Spiritual Energy exited her mouth, but this, no one saw.After a while, the small shield in her hand suddenly shone brightly, and then a dazzling yellow light burst out.When the blinding light dissipated, the small shield flew out of her hand and hovered in mid-air in the private room, then enlarged itself from the size of a palm, eventually stopping when it reached half the size of a person.\u201cCousin, try again.\u201d Lou Mu Yan waved, and the yellow shield obediently returned to her hand, returning to the size of her palm.Yun Lan forced the shock in his eyes down and took the shield. Then he channelled some Elemental Energy into it and discovered that he could actually connect with the shield. His lips curled up, threw it up gently, and with a thought, the shield immediately flashed a layer of bright light and enlarged.\u201cSpirit Treasure!\u201d Yun Luo exclaimed.Shopkeeper Lu looked at the shield that Yun Lan controlled at will and narrowed his eyes, then laughed out loudly: \u201cCongratulations to the Third Prince. This shield was previously identified as a Peak-Quality Spirit Tool, and if one could control it, then it could potentially increase a quality, but who knew that this shield would skip Peerless-Quality and advance straight into a Low-Quality Spirit Treasure. It's value is hundred times your bid.\u201d\u201cIt was indeed a bargain.\u201d Yun Lan's face also showed a rare look of delight. He also didn't think that this small shield would be a Spirit Treasure.In the entire Yan'zhou Country, those who had Spirit Treasures could be counted on ten fingers, and they were all high-stage experts. Why wouldn't he be happy to be fated to obtain something like this.Lou Mu Yan returned to her seat without any ripples in her eyes, as if this was a trivial matter and that she had long known this would be the result.When she released her Mental Energy to suppress the beast's Soul earlier, she discovered that this shield was a Spirit Treasure.Magic Tools were divided into Spirit Tools, Spirit Treasures, Saint Tool, Saint Treasure, Deity Tool and Deity Treasure.Each level was also divided into Low-Quality, Middle-Quality, High-Quality, Peak-Quality and Peerless Quality.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksWhen Yun Lan saw Lou Mu Yan sitting calmly in her seat sipping her tea, he could only sigh\u2014this cousin of his was more composed and graceful than any of the others present.He cast a grateful look and Lou Mu Yan returned it with a smile.\u201cLou Mu Yan, how did you know that there was something suspicious about this shield?\u201d Xiao Zi Ang discovered that Lou Mu Yan had kept him on the edge of his seat so many times today, but he didn't feel good if he didn't ask questions.Shopkeeper Lu rubbed the jadeite thumb ring he wore and said with a mysterious smile: \u201cThis old man is also very curious about how Young Miss Lou could control this shield at will. Can Young Miss Lou satisfy out curiosity?\u201d Then he added, \u201cOf course, if it is inconvenient, then Young Miss Lou could regard it as if this old man did not ask.\u201dLou Mu Yan took a sip of tea and looked down at it. The tea water was golden, rich, and clear, and a rich tea fragrance lingered around her nose.Then she raised her eyes and asked instead, \u201cShopkeeper Lu, does the Ming Alliance of Merchants sell this season's High-Quality Spiritual Tea?\u201d\u201cNaturally we do. If Young Miss Lou wants to buy, then this old man can apply for some.\u201d Shopkeeper Lu halted, then followed her words. It was only a little bit of Spiritual Tea, he could still make the decision.\u201cLou Mu Yan, you ignored me again.\u201d Xiao Zi Ang tugged at Lou Mu Yan's sleeve, annoyed. Only when he realised her eyebrows wrinkled together lightly did he immediately let go.Lou Mu Yan realised that Xiao Zi Ang's character was really the simpler one amongst the few black-bellied men here. She rolled her eyes at him, then answered: \u201cTruth is, there's a Soul of a Vicious Beast sealed inside this defensive shield. If you couldn't suppress it, then you naturally wouldn't be able to control this Spirit Treasure.\u201d\u201cSo that's how it is.\u201d Shopkeeper Lu nodded thoughtfully. Although he was curious about how Lou Mu Yan knew about the Beast Soul sealed within the shield, but that involved another person's secrets, so he resisted asking.\u201cThen how do you know that there's a Vicious Beast's Soul in the shield?\u201d Yun Luo discovered that he had completely misunderstood Lou Mu Yan\u2014how was she a good-for-nothing trash, she could even draw talismans in the void, she sure hid her talents well, \u201cDid you use the talisman you drew in the void to suppress the Beast Soul?\u201d\u201cRegarding how I knew there was a Vicious Beast's Soul in the shield, forgive me for being unable to tell.\u201d Lou Mu Yan raised her eyebrows with a smile\u2014she wouldn't reveal her exceptional Mental Energy, \u201cAs for the Spirit Talisman, of course it was used to suppress the Beast Soul.\u201d\u201cHumph, pretending to be mysterious.\u201d Zeng Rou clenched her hands\u2014how could this trash really discover the secret of this shield? Impossible\u2014it must be like a blind cat finding a dead mouse2. She unconsciously snorted out loud when she thought that.A sliver of jealousy flashed in Gu Yan Ran's eyes. She originally planned to see Lou Mu Yan make a fool of herself, but who knew the trash suddenly became so powerful. She felt a little uneasy about the Academy annual competition coming up soon. Seeing Zeng Rou come out to teach Lou Mu Yan a lesson, the corners of her lips rose.\u201cImpudent, who allowed you to interrupt?\u201d Zeng Rou, a big-breasted woman with no brains, was exceptionally annoying. After Yun Lan's reproach, he ordered the guards behind him, \u201cThrow her out.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d The two guards were also very disgusted with Zeng Rou's behaviour. Young Miss Lou helped their master obtain a Spirit Treasure, yet this woman dared to ridicule. She was truly courting death. The two immediately stepped up and dragged her out.It was then that Zeng Rou realised she had lost her composure. This was mainly due to being so used to acting arrogant in front of Lou Mu Yan that she reflexively scoffed at her. She didn't expect to have caused trouble today.\u201cThird Prince, I didn't mean it, can you please forgive me.\u201d When Zeng Rou was dragged to the door, she exerted her strength in an attempt to get rid of the restraints of the two guards and turned her head to beg Yun Lan coquettishly.If she was really thrown out of here today, not only would she lose face, but the Zeng Clan would also completely lose face, and by the time she returned, she'd be in trouble.Yun Lan waved his hand impatiently and signalled to the guards to hurry up. Shopkeeper Lu also instructed the attendants next to him: \u201cIn the future, this Young Miss of the Zeng clan is not allowed to enter any shops of the Ming Alliance of Merchants for trade, nor is she allowed to participate in auctions.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cNo, I don't want that.\u201d Zeng Rou panicked when she heard the words of Shopkeeper Lu. Suddenly remembering someone, she immediately yelled out to Chi Yi Xuan, \u201cCousin, cousin, save me.\u201d1idiom describing her movements were very natural and smooth.2idiom meaning she got lucky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So he cooled the tea with the lid of the cup, pretending to not have heard.Upon thinking of something, he glanced sideways at Lou Mu Yan and discovered that her gaze towards Zeng Rou was full of disgust. So he cooled the tea with the lid of the cup, pretending to not have heard.Lou Mu Yan was like an attractive bright light now, so much so that he couldn't take his gaze off of her and was inexplicably attracted to her. Regarding Zeng Rou's situation, he'll take it as giving Lou Mu Yan some face.Zeng Rou also wanted to beg the Seventh Princess and Gu Yan Ran, but discovered that they didn't even look at her. She was so anxious tears were surfacing.Since she was about to be dragged away anyways, she might as well spill all her anger on Lou Mu Yan, but she only got to say the word 'Lou' before her mouth was covered by the guards and dragged out.\u201cFinally peaceful.\u201d Xiao Zi Ang picked his ears\u2014that Zeng Rou woman sure was annoying, and sure couldn't take any hints.Gu Yan Ran moved her gaze from the door and onto Chi Yi Xuan. Seeing his indifferent expression, she held her breath. If the woman dragged out today was her, then would this man speak for her?Her peach-pink nails deeply embedded into her flesh\u2014he definitely would. She believed that Chi Yi Xuan liked her.Then viciousness flashed in her eyes. So what if Lou Mu Yan could use Elemental Energy now? During the Academy's annual competition, she'd just handicap her again. She'll see how arrogant this bitch would be then.\u201cCousin, after you go back, you should refine the Beast Soul. Then this Spirit Treasure will recognise you as its master.\u201d Lou Mu Yan secretly sent Yun Lan a telepathic message.Yun Lan put away the shield and only answered with 'ok!', then didn't say anymore. It wasn't appropriate to talk more about it here.As soon as Yun Lan finished replying telepathically, Ni Jun returned onto the auction stage to start the new round of auctions.\u201cI believe everyone will be tempted by the item we will auction now.\u201d Ni Jun teased, then clapped his hands with a smile.Following, an attendant carried something up to the auction platform. Ni Jun uncovered the red cloth and a rectangular cage appeared in front of everyone, with a small shimmering white furred beast locked inside. There was a cluster of bright red fur, like a blazing flame, on its forehead.Seeing that the item auctioned was a Demonic Beast cub of a species many people didn't recognise, some asked aloud.\u201cWhat kind of Demonic Beast is this? I've never seen it before!\u201d\u201cHm? It actually has the strength of a Tier 2 Beast. This cub is actually a Tier 2 Demonic Beast. After growing up it's got to reach Tier 5 or 6 right?\u201d\u201cTier 5 or 6? Then this is worth a shot.\u201dThe discussion below was endless, and upon seeing everyone's emotions were aroused, Ni Jin said with a smile: \u201cThis is a Fire Cloud Mink cub. Its battle power isn't strong, but it has an extremely keen sense of smell and could find Spiritual Herbs and Spirit Stones. At maturity, it could be as strong as a Tier 5 Demonic Beast.\u201dAlthough the Demonic Beast wasn't strong in terms of combat power, but the fact that it could find Spiritual Herbs and Spirit Stones was something that attracted the attention of many experts. The eyes of many\u2014who already had a mountain of fortune\u2014lit up, ready to act.Lou Mu Yan was also one of them. Of course, she wasn't just interested in this Demonic Beast cub's ability to find Spiritual Herbs and Spirit Stones, but also because she recognised this as a mutated royal Demonic Beast, the Spirit Devourer.Though this Demonic Beast resembled a Fire Cloud Mink, and its talents in the early stage were also similar, but once it reached Tier 6, it could unlock its bloodline and activate its innate talent inherited through its bloodline\u2014that was when it would be a true Spirit Devourer Beast.The Spirit Devourer Beast was considered a King-Class Demonic Beast that reigned over its own territory in the Demonic Realm back in her old world. Its value was incomparable to that of a Fire Cloud Mink.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksHowever, judging from the current situation, the people present may not have recognised its true identity. She decided that regardless of the price, she'd definitely win it.\u201cI believe everyone already has their baseline for the price of this Demonic Beast, so this one won't say anymore. The bidding begins, starting price is one million gold coins.\u201d\u201cTwo million.\u201d\u201cFive million.\u201d\u201cTen Million.\u201dGu Yan Ran and the rest were also exceptionally excited, so everyone, except Lou Mu Yan, participated in the bid. But after bidding a few times, their excitement was soon extinguished as the small beast was vied for so intensely by the people in nearby private rooms that its price rose to 'twenty-eight million'.\u201cThirty million.\u201d Lou Mu Yan's sudden announcement stunned everyone in the private room.\u201cLou Mu Yan, you've gone crazy right.\u201d Yun Jin said, dumfounded: \u201cThat's thirty million black-gold coins. Don't randomly make your bid. If you really end up winning but can't afford it, then the consequences will be very serious. It'd be considered light to have a broken leg or arm. The Ming Alliance of Merchants wouldn't let you go just because you're the Young Miss of the General's Mansion.\u201d\u201cMu Yan, be cautious!\u201d Even Yun Lan showed disapproval this time.Lu Mu Yan had no money at all on herself, and he didn't have much left on him either. There was no way they could pay for this Demonic Beast. If they randomly bid for it, they'd be punished by the Ming Alliance of Merchants.Chi Yi Xuan frowned deeper and he also couldn't help but reprimand: \u201cThe Ming Alliance of Merchants isn't something we can provoke. Don't cause trouble.\u201d\u201cYeah! I don't care about you competing against me for the cauldron, but if you raise the price recklessly, then the fury of the experts isn't something you can bear.\u201d Xiao Zi Ang also couldn't help but remind her\u2014the person in the private room opposite them was a Sword Monarch expert!Yun Luo also added helplessly: \u201cEven if your grandfather and father stepped up, they might not be able to help you.\u201dThe Seventh Princess just glanced at Lou Mu Yan curiously without any indication of her stance. For some reason, she felt that Lou Mu Yan didn't look like such an impulsive person.At this time, the price was still rising, and hearing someone from the private room opposite them bid 'thirty-five million', several people in this private room sighed with relief. Only Gu Yan Ran hoped that Lou Mu Yan would continue, then be heavily punished by the Ming Alliance of Merchants.And Lou Mu Yan didn't disappoint her either, directly bidding 'forty million'.\u201cI'm serious, I'm not messing around and I'm not causing trouble. Since I dared to bid, then I'd naturally bear the consequences.\u201d Lou Mu Yan looked at the few people seriously. As for Gu Yan Ran watching her as if watching a joke, she completely ignored it.Seeing Lou Mu Yan's determination, Yun Lan and the others couldn't say anymore. With Lou Mu Yan's previous performance, she didn't seem like she was being wilful this time.\u201cForty-three million.\u201d The private room next to them continued.\u201cForty-five million.\u201d Lou Mu Yan chased.The person in the opposite room announced the high price of 'fifty million'.Then the price reached 'sixty million' announced by Lou Mu Yan, the audience was in an uproar. This figure wasn't something any ordinary person could pay.The person in the private room opposite them also stopped quoting, presumably due to the price reaching his limit.Although The Fire Cloud Mink could search for Spiritual Herbs and Spirit Stones, but Spiritual herbs and Spirit Stones developed in Treacherous Zones or relatively dangerous places, so if one wasn't powerful, then the talents of the Fire Cloud Mink was just a burden. Sixty million black-gold coins already exceeded the price that many people could bear.\u201cThe little friend opposite, this Demonic Beast is very important to this old man. Why don't you stop now. Take it as this old man owing you a personal favour.\u201d A hoarse, aged voice came from the opposite private room. It was an accident that he came to Yan'zhou Country to attend this auction, and as he was in a hurry, he only carried a little more than sixty million black-gold coins.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His temper is extremely weird and is not recommended to offend.\u201d\u201cI thank Shopkeeper Lu's reminder, but that Demonic Beast is very important to me. Even if it's a Sword Monarch expert, they don't have the right to force me to concede to him here in the Ming Alliance of Merchants right?\u201d Lou Mu Yan pondered\u2014so what if that person had a weird temper and shouldn't be offended. If a cultivator was afraid the moment they met an expert, then how could they achieve greatness.\u201cSince Young Miss Lou chose such, then this old man will not say anymore. Here on the territory of the Ming Alliance of Merchants, this old man can promise that even if a Sword Sovereign expert arrived, they would still not be able to force our distinguished guests to concede our auction items to someone else. What items do you wish to auction and use to deduct from the price, take it out as you wish.\u201d Shopkeeper Lu felt even more appreciation for Lou Mu Yan. Whether it was because she was ignorant or bold, her courage was worthy of praise.Lou Mu Yan exuded confidence, then spoke to the private room opposite: \u201cApologies, this Demonic Beast is also important to me, so forgive this Junior for not yielding.\u201dHer attitude could be regarded as respectful, but it implied a sense of assertiveness. It was her inherent manner. Her aloofness had long been ingrained into her bones, and she wouldn't change just because was weaker now, and it was even more impossible for her to succumb to anyone.\u201cHumph. You do not know how to appreciate kindness.\u201d The person on the other side snorted coldly, evidently unhappy. \u201cSixty-three million.\u201d\u201cSixty-four million.\u201d Lou Mu Yan stroked the edge of the tea, then bid another price. She guessed that the money brought by the other party was already reaching its limit.As expected, the moment her voice fell, the private room opposite them fell silent.Ni Jun also didn't expect that someone would dare oppose that Sword Monarch expert, but he retracted his attention, then began to announce the auction results, \u201cThe distinguished guest of private room number nine bid sixty-four million black-gold coins. Are there any higher bids?\u201d\u201cSeeing that no one bid anymore, he continued: \u201cI'll count from ten, if there's no higher bid, then this Fire Cloud Mink cub will belong to the distinguished guest of the private room number nine.\u201cTen, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three\u2026\u201dWhen Ni Jun arrived at three, the innermost private room on the opposite side announced: \u201cSeventy million.\u201d[Gasp!!] Just when everyone thought that the person in private room number nine would win, another bid came out.With the price so high, many people felt their flesh hurt1\u2014what a spendthrift. But many also held the mentality of wanting to watch a nice show as they waited for a response from private room number nine.\u201cThat private room belongs to the King of Zhen'xi?\u201d Yun Lan's expression changed as he asked Yun Jin beside him.Yun Ji also didn't expect that the King of Zhen'xi would suddenly interfere, frowned, and said: \u201cYeah, that's the private room of Royal Uncle.\u201dThe King of Zhen'zi was the younger brother of the Emperor from a different mother, and had the strength of a Sword King. He held a third of the military power of Yan'zhou Country, was arrogant, overbearing, presumptuous and unrestrained. With him competing against Lou Mu Yan, the price could be doubled.Lou Mu Yan knew who the King of Zhen'xi was. The relationship between this King and her father had been rather strained. A few years back, they even fought against each other regarding the northwest war. Eventually the Emperor sent the King of Zhen'xi to supress a beast tide a foreign race initiated.But in only one year's time, the King of Zhen'xi was gradually retreating and the beast tide flooded several border cities. It was only because the Emperor sent Lou Mo Yu that they were able to turn the side, and in the end, they were able to kill all the foreign races that invaded Yan'zhou Country.This, however, also made the King of Zhen'xi resentful, antagonising the Lou Clan everywhere, and was also very unwelcome of Yun Lan who was born to the Empress. This time, he probably knew that it was Yun Lan's private room, so he deliberately wanted to compete for the Fire Cloud Mink.\u201cEighty million.\u201d Lou Mu Yan remembered the King of Zhen'xi in her heart. However much more money he made her pay for the Fire Cloud Mink, she would be sure to have him vomit out in the future, multiplied.\u201cNinety million.\u201d The King of Zhen'xi also directly raised the price by ten million.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksLou Mu Yan narrowed her beautiful eyes and a trace of danger flashed in them, \u201cOne hundred million.\u201d\u201cHumph, don't announce such a high price and be unable to afford it later, it'd be embarrassing.\u201d The King of Zhen'xi snorted coldly.Lou Mu Yan said coldly: \u201cThere's no need to bother you with that.\u201dWith the price of the Demonic Beast suddenly rising by more than thirty million, naturally the Ming Alliance of Merchants was the happiest. Ni Jun smiled and asked the same question again to the rest, and when he counted to one and there was no increase in price, he announced the ownership of the Fire Cloud Mink.Meanwhile, everyone in the private room cast their gazes to Lou Mu Yan, wanting to see what she would sell to gather one hundred million black-gold coins.There was concern in Yun Lan's eyes, thinking that if it didn't work, then he could only use the one credit opportunity that the Ming Alliance of Merchants gave to the Imperial Family and collect the money after the auction. He sure didn't know what medicine his cousin sold in her gourd2.Gu Yan Ran couldn't help but display a look of gloating. This trash, Lou Mu Yan, was indeed a troublemaker. In one auction, not only did she offend a Sword Monarch expert, but also the whimsical King of Zhen'xi.She'll see what this little trash could take out to exchange for the Fire Cloud Mink. If she couldn't take out the money, then the Ming Alliance of Merchants definitely wouldn't let her go easily.\u201cI have fifteen million here.\u201d Yun Jin put away the playful smile he had and looked at Lou Mu Yan. His intentions were clear, all the black-gold coins he had would be given to her.Regardless of why this woman bid for it, but if she couldn't take out the money, then she would definitely be punished by the Ming Alliance of Merchants. On one hand, Lou Mu Yan was Yun Lan's cousin, and on the other hand, he also had a lot of interest in her, so he couldn't just sit by and do nothing.\u201cI'll accept your thoughts.\u201d Lou Mu Yan looked at Yun Jin in surprise, then her lips curled up\u2014as expected, one could only tell one's coldness or warmth3\u00a0when experiencing adversity together.Yun Lan didn't have anymore black-gold coins, so his gaze swept to Yun Luo and Xiao Zi Ang. The two tacitly moved their gazes away. They won't pay for Lou Mu Yan's wilfulness. They reminded her already when she was bidding.Seeing Yun Lan turn to her, Yun Xin smiled gentle and shook her head, indicating that she didn't have many black-gold coins with her.She felt a little complicated towards Lou Mu Yan. Before when Lou Mu Yan was a trash, she didn't mind, but after she saw a different Lou Mu Yan today, it gave her a sense of crisis. She felt that, in the future, the limelight in the Imperial Academy might be snatched by Lou Mu Yan, and a sense of unpleasantness rose in her heart.Chi Yi Xuan had more than ten million black-gold coins on him, but he didn't say anything. It wasn't that he was reluctant, but he purely felt that Lou Mu Yan's temperament was too arrogant and wilful, so it was good to teach her a lesson. It could avoid her causing even more trouble when going out next time as well as avoid her humiliating him in the future.Lou Mu Yan paid attention to the reaction of everyone present, then sneered inwardly. She looked up to see Shopkeeper Lu looking at her with a smile on his face, yet not quite a true smile. She didn't say much and handed a porcelain bottle directly to him, \u201cShopkeeper Lu, how much do you think this pill is worth?\u201dShopkeeper Lu took the porcelain bottle curiously, opened the cap, then a light, gentle pill fragrance spread from the bottle. His entire body relaxed with its smell alone.He took out a white porcelain bowl that he specifically used to place pills from his interspatial ring and tipped the pill onto it. He lowered his head to take a careful look, then asked: \u201cI smell that the pill is a Grade 2 High-Quality pill, but I can't tell what kind of pill it is. I ask Young Miss Lou to tell.\u201d\u201cThis pill is called the Marrow Cleansing Pill, and it's effect is just as its name. It can wash the marrow and cleanse the body, change one's constitution and expand the meridians. Although it's Grade 2, it has the effect of a Grade 3 pill.\u201d Lou Mu Yan explained indifferently.\u201cWhat? There's such an effect.\u201d Shopkeeper Lu appeared shocked and was even more astonished inside. This sort of pill had never been heard before. He carefully put the pill back into the porcelain bottle: \u201cThis old man is unable to appraise this pill. I must ask a high-level Appraiser of the Ming Alliance of Merchants to take a look in order to judge its value. Young Miss Lou, what do you think?\u201d\u201cShopkeeper Lu can do as you please.\u201d Lou Mu Yan played with the teacup, looking indifferent.\u201cThen please wait a moment, Young Miss Lou.\u201d Shopkeeper Lu nodded with a smile then hurriedly left the private room with the porcelain bottle, evidently very anxious.While the others in the private room look at Lou Mu Yan with incredulity. Marrow Cleansing Pill? Why hadn't they ever heard of such a pill. But if it truly had the effect it said, then that pill's value would be immeasurable, and its efficacy would simply be Heaven-defying.1them using that absurd amount of money makes them feel as pained as their meat being cut.2didn't know what secrets she had as she was so mysterious about it.3could tell a person's true character in times of adversity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Before him stood two people, reporting on the situation of the Alliance of Merchants.[DONG DONG DONG!!]A series of knocks sounded from the door, and the man nodded to an enchanting woman who stood beside him. Understanding, she walked over to open the door.\u201cGuardian Lan.\u201d Shopkeeper Lu addressed respectfully. The woman glanced at him coolly, then returned to stand behind the man.\u201cYour Highness!\u201d Shopkeeper Lu entered the secret room and discovered that there weren't just the two elders sitting inside, but even their Highness was present, so he immediately bent down and greeted respectfully.Ming Xiu said lazily: \u201cWhat matter is so urgent?\u201dJust now, a distinguished guest from private room number nine took out a pill to ask our Alliance of Merchants to auction. However, this subordinate had never seen such a pill, and could only determine that it was a Grade 2 pill.\u201d Then he held out the white porcelain bottle in his hands, \u201cThe distinguished guest said that this pill is called the Marrow Cleansing Pill. Even though it's only a Grade 2 pill, but it's effect is not lower than the average Grade 3 pill.\u201d\u201cMarrow Cleansing Pill.\u201d Ming Xiu murmured softly.\u201cYes! The distinguished guest said that the Marrow Cleansing Pill can wash the marrow and cleanse the body, change one's constitution and expand the meridians.\u201d Shopkeeper Lu repeated Lou Mu Yan's words.\u201cLet me see.\u201d Ming Xiu stretched out his hand.Upon seeing this, Shopkeeper Lu handed the porcelain bottle over quickly. Ming Xiu opened the cap, and a familiar pill scent filled his nose. His eyes grew darker, asking: \u201cWho wanted to auction this pill?\u201d\u201cIt is Young Miss Lou Mu Yan from the Imperial Capital's General's Mansion.\u201dMing Xiu's eyes revealed an understanding, then an arc rose on his lips\u2014it really was that little woman.\u201cThis pill does indeed have the effect of washing one's marrow. Elder Ye1\u00a0can go and discuss this matter with Lou Mu Yan in private room number nine.\u201d Ming Xiu fell silent for a while, then tossed the bottle he was playing with back to Shopkeeper Lu.Then, as if remembering something, he said to Elder Ye telepathically: \u201cGive her a Silver Ming Alliance Token.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness!\u201d Old Lu's pupils constricted and supressed the astonishment in his heart. He stood up and nodded respectfully to Ming Xiu.\u201cYou can all leave too.\u201d Ming Xiu waved at the several people in the secret room to signal them to leave.The people respectfully withdrew from the secret room, and only the enchanting woman known as Guardian Lan stayed still.\u201cMo Lan, leave as well.\u201d Ming Xiu wore a devilish smile, but there wasn't much warmth in his eyes.Mo Lan bit her lower lip lightly, and her pretty face revealed slight seductiveness before she stepped forward gracefully and bowed. \u201cYes!\u201d Then she took a long look at Ming Xiu and left the secret room.After leaving the secret room, she concealed the seductiveness she displayed, and there was a chill in her enchanting temperament. Her seductiveness and tenderness would only be left for her master.Even if her master wasn't interested in her right now, but she believed that one day her master would definitely see her charms and fall for her.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThe thick powdery smell that lingered around his nose gradually dispersed after Mo Lan left, and only then did Ming Xiu's furrowed brows relax. He didn't like to be close to others, but he discovered that the natural soothing medicinal fragrance that the little woman exuded made him feel rather comfortable.Not long after, a series of knocks sounded on the door of private room number nine.Shopkeeper Lu walked in respectfully, bringing with him a sturdy old man with a head of silver, then introduced to the several people: \u201cThis person is the person in charge of the auction of our Ming Alliance of Merchants here at Yan'zhou Country, Elder Ye.\u201d\u201cElder Ye.\u201d Lou Mu Yan and company stood up in the private room and addressed.This old man exuded the aura of a Sword King, so even Yun Lan and the other imperial children didn't dare underestimate him and was very respectful.\u201cNo need to be so polite, you can all sit.\u201d Elder Ye nodded with a gentle smile on his face, but the faint pressure he emanated still made people afraid to be presumptuous.After they sat own, Elder Ye looked at Lou Mu Yan and asked with a smile: \u201cSo it's you that used one-hundred million ink-gold coins to buy the Fire Cloud Mink, and now wants to auction the Marrow Cleansing Pill?\u201d\u201cElder Ye, it is indeed this Junior.\u201d Lou Mu Yan's expression didn't change, keeping her faint smile and her eyes revealed only calmness. There wasn't a bit of the low profile that one would present in front of a high-level expert, but neither was she arrogant either. It was all natural.Elder Ye cast his gaze on Lou Mu Yan and seeing that her expression was calm, neither humble nor haughty, a faint admiration flashed through the depth of his eyes.\u201cI've taken a look at this pill. How good is its effect in washing the marrow? Is it suitable for anyone?\u201d Elder Ye's face was expectant.\u201cThis Marrow Cleansing Pill can wash the marrow and cleanse the body, as well as broaden the meridians. It's effective for people below Sword Monarch, but it does vary from person to person in terms of expanding their meridians. For some people, their meridians may only double in size, while for others they may only increase by a tenth of its original size. It's most effective for those ages ten to thirty when taking, but not anyone could take it either as one must be above Sword Apprentice at least.\u201d Lou Mu Yan explained without concealing anything.\u201cIt actually has such effects.\u201d Elder Ye's eyes were also burning with desire. He was a Sword King right now, so according to Lou Mu Yan, this was also effective for him. But then a thought came to him: \u201cAlthough you say this, but no one has taken this Marrow Cleansing Pill after all, so we can't judge its effects accurately.\u201dLou Mu Yan nodded with a smile: \u201cNaturally. But when you auction it, you can add one point. Just say that the trash Young Miss Lou Mu Yan, of the Imperial Capital's General's Mansion, who was born with the Terminal Meridians constitution, after taking this Marrow Cleansing Pill, not only eradicated and improved her constitution, but also advanced from an Initial-Phase Sword Apprentice to an Initial-Phase Great Sword Master.\u201d\u201cTo think this pill is this miraculous. This old man was just wondering how Young Miss Lou advanced to the Great Sword Master cultivation base. It turns out that you eradicated the Terminal Meridians constitution after taking the Marrow Cleansing Pill.\u201dElder Ye had suspected that Lou Mu Yan had improved her constitution due to the Marrow Cleansing Pill, allowing her to absorb Spiritual Force and use Elemental Energy. But after hearing her say it so nonchalantly, he was still astonished.He smiled even more amicably and asked: \u201cI wonder if, after Young Miss Lou took this Marrow Cleansing Pill and improved and eradicated your Terminal Meridians constitution, your meridians have also widened?\u201d\u201cOf course. The meridians in my body have probably more than doubled.\u201d Lou Mu Yan didn't conceal it. The better the effects of the Marrow Cleansing Pill, the more conducive to the soaring of the auction price.Hearing these words, even the calm expression, that Elder Ye deliberately presented, cracked\u2014it was far too alluring to him. He fell silent for a moment, then asked: \u201cYoung Miss Lou, could you allow this old man to see check your meridians? After confirming that there is one true instance of this Marrow Cleansing Pill working, then its auction price will be even higher.\u201dIf her meridians really did more than double, then that meant the speed of absorbing the Spiritual Force of Heaven and earth would also be more than doubled. This sort of pill with Heaven-defying effects would even make him scramble to it.\u201cSure.\u201d Lou Mu Yan nodded in agreement. Her Mental Energy was stronger than Elder Ye, so she wasn't afraid that he'd do anything to her secretly.Elder Ye stretched out his hand to probe Lou Mu Yan's veins, then swept it with his Mental Energy. The expression on his face was solemn, then he couldn't help but display excitement. He let go of Lou Mu Yan's hand and sighed with emotion: \u201cYoung Miss Lou, this Grade 2 pill is indeed comparable to a Grade 3 pill.\u201dHearing what Elder Ye said, the expressions of the people in the private room changed. After Lou Mu Yan took this Marrow Cleansing Pill, not only did she eradicate her Terminal Meridians constitution, but also enlarged her meridians by more than double. Who wouldn't be tempted by such a pill?1different 'Ye'. This one is \u53f6. Ye Qing Han's Clan is \u591c. Though same tone.Note: Changed black-gold coins to ink-golds coins.

Even those that followed Elder Ye into the room stared with a fierce desire at the white porcelain bottle he was holding.Elder Ye thought a bit, then asked Lou Mu Yan with a smile: \u201cWhat starting price does Young Miss Lou plan to set for this pill?\u201d\u201cI don't really understand these things, but I believe the Ming Alliance of Merchants will help me sell this at a good price. So I ask of Elder Ye to also set the starting price.\u201d Lou Mu Yan displayed a gentle smile. She showed a lot of trust towards the Ming Alliance of Merchants.Elder Ye nodded and smiled, saying: \u201cSince that is the case, then this old man will set the price for Young Miss Lou.\u201d\u201cThen I'll trouble Elder Ye.\u201d Lou Mu Yan replied politely.Elder Ye nodded with a smile, thought a little, then couldn't help but ask: \u201cYoung Miss Lou, do you still have more Marrow Cleansing Pills?\u201dHe originally wanted to ask how Lou Mu Yan obtained this Marrow Cleansing Pill\u2014was it because she met a powerful Alchemist? But he held back. After all, the majority of Alchemists had weird temperaments and didn't like other people enquiring about them. She could only do his best to befriend Lou Mu Yan for now.The others also stared at Lou Mu Yan with scorching gazes.\u201cI also obtained this Marrow Cleansing Pill by accident, and while I do indeed have two more on me, I don't plan on selling them.\u201d Lou Mu Yan refused with a smile.Things that were rare were more expensive. She didn't want to suddenly take out so many at once, and as Ye Qing Han reminded, it wasn't suitable for her to reveal her identity as an Alchemist. Right now, her main task was to increase her strength as soon as possible.\u201cThen that truly is a pity.\u201d Old Lu revealed some disappointment, but he quickly recovered his composure, smiled and said: \u201cIf Young Miss Lou has other good pills or items you would like to sell in the future, then you can come to our Ming Alliance of Merchants. I promise you a satisfactory price.\u201dAfter speaking, Elder Ye took out a silver token the size of a palm with the word 'Ming' on it, then handed it to Lou Mu Yan, \u201cThis is a token that is only given to the top distinguished guests of our Ming Alliance of Merchants. Now, this old man will make an exception and gift one to Young Miss Lou.\u201dSeeing Elder Ye take out a silver token and hand it to Lou Mu Yan, everyone's expressions changed.To think the moment the Ming Alliance of Merchants gifted something, they'd gift something that was a representation of power, the silver token that was only given to those who had the strength of a Sword Monarch and above\u2014all this because Lou Mu Yan wanted to auction the Marrow Cleansing Pill? This was too exaggerated.Lou Mu Yan's luck was so good that it made people jealous, envy, and hateful1.But even if some of them had their doubts about this, the Ming Alliance of Merchants had always been domineering, so no one dared to question or object to the decisions they made.Gu Yan Ran was in an exceptionally bad mood. Even when her nails embedded into her flesh, she didn't feel the pain, and she tried hard to cover up the jealousy in her eyes.She didn't expect that Lou Mu Yan not only turned the tables, experienced such a fortuitous opportunity in obtaining the Marrow Cleansing Pill that eradicated her Terminal Meridians constitution, became an Initial-Phase Great Sword Master, but was now also so highly regarded by the Ming Alliance of Merchants. What sort of dog-crap luck2\u00a0did she step on?Lou Mu Yan took the token and felt that there was a small Array hidden inside this silver token. An understanding crossed her eyes\u2014the Ming Alliance of Merchant's strength was certainly powerful.\u201cThank you, Elder Ye. I, Lou Mu Yan, will remember this personal favour.\u201d Lou Mu Yan put the token into her interspatial ring and accepted Elder Ye's display of friendliness.The affection in Elder Ye's eyes thickened\u2014though this little girl was rather young, but she was very clever and quick-witted. As expected from a child educated by a distinguished clan.The previous rumours were probably all exaggerated and false. If such a quick-witted and intelligent woman was considered trash, then who knew how many trashes there were in this world.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cWhen you return home, drip a drop of blood on your token and it will recognise you as its master. Even if other people obtain this token, it'd be useless.\u201dElder Ye reminded again: \u201cYoung Miss Lou must keep it safe. This token's usage isn't just limited to auctions. But it is inconvenient for this old man to say anymore. You will know once you experience it in the future.\u201dLou Mu Yan nodded. She understood what Elder Ye meant. If there came a day where she had the strength to truly utilise this silver token, then naturally she'd know its secrets; if she couldn't meet the requirements to use it, then she would also lose the qualification to use this token.Elder Ye's eyes inadvertently revealed slight admiration. If anyone else obtained their special guest Ming Alliance Token from the Ming Alliance of Merchants, then they'd probably already display excitement and joy on their face.But this teenager girl was able to remain this calm and composed, maintaining an indifferent attitude from beginning to end, and without any arrogance or rashness. If she could retain this state of mind, then her future could not be assessed.\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d Lou Mu Yan appreciated Elder Ye.\u201cThen this old man will go order the auctioning of this Marrow Cleansing Pill. And this Fire Cloud Mink was bought by you. Afterwards, the Alliance of Merchants will deduct the ink-gold coins from the auction of the pill, and the rest of the ink-gold coins will be settled together.\u201d Elder Ye motioned to the attendant who was carrying a cage behind him to put the Fire Cloud Mink down.It could be regarded that he was selling Lou Mu Yan some face\u2014the moment the Marrow Cleansing Pill was auctioned, then it would definitely attract the attention of Yan'zhou Country, and even the entire land's interest. It's price would be far more valuable than the Fire Cloud Mink.\u201cOk! Then I will trouble Elder Ye.\u201d Lou Mu Yan didn't feign modesty either. This was all because these people didn't know the actual value of a Spirit Devourer. If they knew, numerous high-level experts would come contend for it.After Elder Ye took his people and left, everyone's eyes were focused on Lou Mu Yan, with a burning desire\u2014particularly Xiao Zi Ang. He was an Alchemist to begin with and loved Alchemy. He was about to stare a hole through Lou Mu Yan right now.Lou Mu Yan sat in her seat, pondered for a moment, then before anyone could speak, threw one porcelain bottle to Yun Lan and Yun Jin each, raised her eyebrows and said: \u201cThe last two Marrow Cleansing Pills, I'll gift them to you.\u201d\u201cPU!\u201d Yun Jin spit the tea out directly\u2014seriously? This generous?Seeing the porcelain bottle thrown over, he immediately threw the teacup away and stretched out his hands to catch it carefully.\u201cThis is too valuable.\u201d Yun Lan reached out and caught the bottle containing the pill. Although he was very enticed by it, but he still endured the strong desire and looked at Lou Mu Yan.Lou Mu Yan's eyes were coloured with a smile\u2014this cousin's character was pretty good. But there was no way she would be able to keep these two pills, so she'd rather turn it into a favour and gift it to Yun Lan. Her aunt loved her dearly since she was young, so this was also a sort of repayment.As for gifting it to Yun Jin, one was because she felt that this man was rather pleasing to the eye earlier, and also because last time when Lou Mu Yan was injured by Gu Yan Ran, it was Yun Jin that stopped the woman's final attack and sent her back to the General's Mansion. Otherwise her dan'tian would've definitely been destroyed. It would've been difficult to cultivate again even with the Marrow Cleansing Pill.Regardless of why Yun Jin helped her then, she still remembered this personal favour. Using the Marrow Cleansing Pill to return that favour would be enough.She had always done what she wanted in life. If a person looked pleasing to the eye, then Magic Tools, pills, so what if she gave it out at will; while if one wasn't pleasing to her eye, no matter how strong they were, how strong their background, if she said she didn't have any, then she didn't have any. Even if they gave her thousands of gold she wouldn't give anything.As they waited for the pill in Elder Ye's hands to be auctioned, she thought about the fact that not only would the Marrow Cleansing Pill rouse people's attentions, but she would probably have people attentive of her as well.If she still had these two pills in her hand, then she'd definitely be harassed by many entities or other distinguished clans. Now that she gave it to Yun Lan and Yun Jin, then she could simply say she had no more, and no one could do anything about it.1a popular colloquial saying in China, so it may be said a lot throughout this series.2popular colloquial in China saying meaning someone was so lucky they didn't even know how these lucky things happened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Yun Jin's maternal clan's background was also very strong, so she wasn't afraid of the Imperial Family making things difficult for them after giving them the Marrow Cleansing Pills.\u201cJust take it. My aunt has always doted on me like her own daughter. We're relatives, it's just a pill, no need to bother about it.\u201d Lou Mu Yan smiled, paying it no mind.Yun Lan slightly revealed his gratefulness. He didn't expect that this cousin that he had only met a few times would be this forthright and generous. Though his Empress Mother definitely played a large role.\u201cAlright! Then I won't be polite. This Marrow Cleansing Pill is indeed very important to me. I'll remember this personal favour. If Mu Yan has anything you need in the future, you can come and find me.\u201d Yun Lan promised with a smile.\u201cSure!\u201d Lou Mu Yan blinked.\u201cLou Mu Yan, Yun Lan's your cousin, it makes sense for you to give it to him. But why give it to me?\u201d Yun Jin couldn't figure out why Lou Mu Yan also gifted her one. Unless it was just because of what happened earlier where he supported her with some money? But that's impossible!Lou Mu Yan didn't conceal it either, \u201cLast time I was injured by that little white flower, it was you who prevented her from destroying my dan'tian, then sent me back to the General's Mansion. Consider this Marrow Cleansing Pill as returning that personal favour.\u201d\u201cThat's just a trivial matter, it's not worth you giving me such a valuable pill.\u201d Yun Jin did desire this pill very much, but he still felt that it wasn't good to just take such a valuable thing from Lou Mu Yan without giving anything in return.Lou Mu Yan held her forehead, then glared at him: \u201cIsn't it fine to just find you pleasing to the eye? A big man like you being so wishy-washy, if you don't want it then return it.\u201d\u201cI want it, how could I not want it.\u201d Yun Jin put the pill into his interspatial ring with a mischievous grin, fearing that Lou Mu Yan really regretted it and wanted it back, \u201cLou Mu Yan, don't worry, this big brother will cover for you in the Imperial Academy from now on. If anyone bullies you again, I'll break her leg.\u201dYun Jin glanced indicatively at Gu Yan Ran\u2014he never liked this scheming woman.Lou Mu Yan rolled her eyes at him, \u201cNo need, I'll clean up those random cats and dogs.\u201dHearing the unscrupulous words between the two, Gu Yan Ran's face paled and hatred rose in her heart, but her expression was aggrieved. Her white teeth bit her lower lip, as if she wanted to cry yet was holding it back. It was just like a delicate flower that was being ravaged by the wind.But it was a pity that Chi Yi Xuan's thoughts weren't on her at all, and the others were even more uninterested in her. Her behaviour was completely ignored.She took a deep breath and suppressed the urge to burst out immediately. Her nails were deeply embedded in her palm. After the Academy's annual competition, she would definitely strike Lou Mu Yan back into the dust she had been in before. As for the Marrow Cleansing Pill, she would definitely obtain one to wash her marrow, cleanse her body and widen her meridians.Gu Yan Ran's eyes flickered. When the auction was over, she should enter the palace. She believed that her elder sister would definitely help her remove Lou Mu Yan and obtain the Marrow Cleansing Pill.\u201cLou Mu Yan, do you still have anymore Marrow Cleansing Pills? Can you sell one to me?\u201d Xiao Zi Ang couldn't help but look at Lou Mu Yan expectantly.He expected nothing from the one that was being auctioned. After all, he didn't bring many ink-gold coins with him, but if he was given some time, he definitely could return to his clan and gather the ink-gold coins necessary to buy the pill.Xiao Zi Ang's words also represented the feelings of the others. No Sword Master below Sword Monarch would be indifferent to this kind of pill.Lou Mu Yan shrugged and said: \u201cNo more. I've given my last two away.\u201dHearing this, the face of those that also wanted to ask revealed disappointment. They all unanimously scoffed 'spendthrift' in their hearts and was exceptionally envious of Yun Jin's good fortune. But they didn't really believe that Lou Mu Yan no longer had anymore Marrow Cleansing Pills. Except, they needed to think about it for a little bit first.Yun Xin clasped the corner of her clothes tightly and the gentle smile on her face seemed a little forced. Marrow Cleansing Pill? She must obtain it. A vicious look of desire flashed across her eyes, and she couldn't help but start to hate Lou Mu Yan.Amongst those present, only Chi Yi Xuan's feelings were the most complicated. He didn't deny that he was very tempted by the Marrow Cleansing Pill, but he really couldn't lower his face and ask Lou Mu Yan for it. Seeing that she actually gifted two priceless Marrow Cleansing Pills to Yun Lan and Yun Jin at no cost, his heart hurt as if it was being cut by a knife.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksSince when did Lou Mu Yan deliberately ignore him when she had something good? The former Lou Mu Yan would definitely cup the Marrow Cleansing Pill in her hands and offer it to him as if offering a treasure, just to receive a casual compliment of his.Why did they suddenly become so estranged and unfamiliar? No. It should be why did Lou Mu Yan so resolutely abandoned him?Chi Yi Xuan raised his eyes and took a deep look at the stunning woman who smiled like the sun, while he felt gloomy. Lou Mu Yan courted him and now she wanted to abandon him? Don't even think about it.Chi Yi Xuan's face was extremely ugly, and there was a little disappointment in his eyes. The hands under his sleeves clenched tightly into fists. Upon seeing this, a trace of ridicule flashed in Yun Luo's eyes\u2014he mistook a pearl for fish eyes1. He shouldn't blame others for the missed opportunity.But as for the Marrow Cleansing Pill, who wouldn't be tempted by it. He needed to return and discuss it with his King Father.Although Xiao Zi Ang was disappointed, he didn't want to pester Lou Mu Yan either. After all, she already said she only had two left. So he stared with a scorching gaze at the white porcelain bottle in Yun Lan's hand.\u201cA'Lan, we're good brothers, can't you show me the Marrow Cleansing Pill.\u201dSeeing Lou Mu Yan's indifference, Yun Lan handed the white porcelain bottle to Xiao Zi Ang. He knew the nature of this friend of his, and he wouldn't pocket it for himself.Xiao Zi Ang took the bottle excitedly as if holding some sort of treasure, then carefully poured the pill out.A smooth, round pill fell into his hand and a pill fragrance spread throughout the entire private room, making one feel refreshed. With the smell alone, they knew how extraordinary the pill was.\u201cThis is a Grade 2 High-Quality pill. The Alchemist who refined this Marrow Cleansing Pill must be a Grade 2 Alchemist at least.\u201d Xiao Zi Ang praised.As he was afraid that the medicinal effects would be lost, after taking a look at the pill, he placed it back into the bottle, then turned to ask Lou Mu Yan, a little embarrassed: \u201cDoes Young Miss Lou perhaps know the Alchemist?\u201d\u201cDon't know.\u201d Lou Mu Yan shook her head firmly.What a joke. The person who refined the pill was herself, how could she expose herself.And even if she said it, probably no one would believe this pill was refined by her anyways, and they'd definitely think she was ill.Besides, she didn't want to be in the limelight right now either. If people knew that she could refine a Grade 2 pill, her and her family's peaceful life would definitely be disturbed. At the very least, now wasn't the time to expose herself.\u201cThen that's a real pity.\u201d Xiao Zi Ang was disappointed again.He loved Alchemy and held a very respectful attitude towards high-level Alchemists. He didn't even need to guess to know that the Alchemist who could refine such a Heaven-defying pill was definitely a highly talented genius. It was a shame he couldn't meet that person just once.Lou Mu Yan didn't care what others thought. She opened the cage on the ground and took out the palm-sized beast that had its eyes closed and scratched its head.The little beast was initially still struggling, but as soon as Lou Mu Yan held it, it smelt the faint fragrance of medicine on her body, and also felt a very gentle Spiritual Energy exuding from her. It couldn't help but snuggle up closer against Lou Mu Yan.The Spirit Devourer's eyes would be closed for the first three months from its birth, and it was only during this time that it was easy to be caught and contracted. It was practically impossible to tame it after it opened its eyes and developed higher intelligence.The Spirit Devourer were unlike other Demonic Beasts where it needed to reach a certain Tier to bear wisdom. As they were a King Class Demonic Beast, after three months from birth, when they opened their eyes, was when they would bear intelligence. Their cultivation speed would also increase day by day.\u201cThis Fire Cloud Mink is rather affectionate towards you. It seems that you two are destined.\u201d Yun Lan put the pill away and said as he smiled at Lou Mu Yan.Lou Mu Yan chuckled softly and nodded in a good mood: \u201cWe are indeed fated.\u201dThe moment she hugged the Spirit Devourer earlier, she discovered an unusual Mental Energy within the little beast's body. It was secretly protecting the internal organs of the beast. She guessed that the origin of this Demonic Beast was extraordinary. She sure found a treasure this time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There were still many things that were auctioned first.Lou Mu Yan also won a Purple Monkey Flower that was an ingredient required to refine the Foundation Establishment Pill. As for the other manuals, Spirit Tools and Spiritual Armour, she didn't need them. But overall, she gained a lot from this auction.The rest in the room also won the items they wanted in general, but because of the appearance of the Marrow Cleansing Pill, they weren't in high spirits.After all the items were auctioned off, Ni Jun smiled and said: \u201cThe next auction is an exceptionally significant finale item that the Ming Alliance of Merchants just received. The auction of this finale product will also be personally presided over by our Alliance of Merchant's high-level Appraiser and the person in charge of the auction of Yan'zhou Country, Elder Ye.[Wow!!] Hearing Ni Jun's words, the people below erupted.What sort of significant finale item could personally bother Elder Ye. He wasn't just a Sword King expert, but also a middle-level Smith. It was rare to see him come out and preside over an auction.However, it was because of the significance the Ming Alliance of Merchants placed on this that the distinguished guests were ready to make their moves. They were looking forward to this significant finale item.Hearing the excited chatter of the people below, Ni Jun naturally stood to the side.Elder Ye walked up onto the auction stage, and behind him was a beautiful woman holding a tray with a white porcelain bottle on it.Seeing that the auction item was a white porcelain bottle, fierce flames of desire rose in their eyes\u2014this sort of bottle usually contained pills.Alchemists on Tian'ling Continent were scarce, and pills were even scarcer. It was already rare that a Grade 1 pill could find its way to the public. This pill must be extraordinary for a Sword King expert to personally come to preside over the auction of it, so everyone was exceptionally expectant and excited. Even those within the private rooms were on the edges of their seats, looking forward to it.Elder Ye coughed gently, and the audience immediately silences. With a gentle smile on his face that made him appear like a spring breeze, he said: \u201cThis finale item is personally appraised by this old man, and so it will also be auctioned off by this old man. I believe it will not disappoint everyone.\u201dSeeing countless eyes staring at him fervently, Elder Ye smiled in satisfaction and continued: \u201cThis time, the finale auction item of our Ming Alliance of Merchants is precisely this Grade 2 pill on this tray, called Marrow Cleansing Pill.\u201cI believe no one has heard of this Marrow Cleansing Pill before, but its effects are Heaven-defying. Although it's a Grade 2 pill, it's comparable to a Grade 3 pill, and perhaps even more precious than a Grade 3 pill.\u201d Elder Ye paused, then added.A commotion rose from below. They didn't expect that the item being auctioned was a Grade 2 pill that was comparable to a Grade 3 pill, and the name alone made people expectant.\u201cElder Ye, quickly tell us the Marrow Cleansing Pill's effects.\u201d Finally, someone who couldn't wait shouted excitedly from below, and he also spoke what everyone was thinking.Elder Ye laughed loudly: \u201cThis Marrow Cleansing Pill can wash the marrow and cleanse the body, expand the meridians, and change one's constitution. It's effective to those below Sword Monarch Stage and has no side effects. Even this old man can't help but be tempted, so this old man will also join in on the bidding later.\u201d[Wow!!] There was another uproar below. Everyone was stunned, then a frenzied look appeared. This pill actually had such Heaven-defying effects.\u201cElder Ye, we've never heard of this pill before, does it really have such an effect?\u201d A doubtful voice sounded from one of the private rooms.Knowing the status of the people in the private rooms were extraordinary, Elder Ye's attitude was rather gentle as he nodded: \u201cIndeed it does have such effects.\u201cEveryone must know that the young lady of the Imperial Capital's General's Mansion's Lou Clan has the Terminal Meridian's constitution, right?\u201d\u201cOf course we know! Young Miss Trash from the General's Mansion, she's so famous, who doesn't know.\u201d A young male's voice sounded from the private room of the King of Zhen'xi that carried ridicule but wasn't the King himself.Elder Ye quickly concealed the unhappiness in his eyes, smiled and said: \u201cYoung Miss Lou took a Marrow Cleansing Pill recently and not only did she eradicate her Terminal Meridians constitution, but she also advanced directly from an Initial-Phase Sword Apprentice to an Initial-Phase Great Sword Master.\u201cI'm sure everyone here knows that it's impossible for a person with the Terminal Meridians constitution to cultivate to a cultivation base above Sword Apprentice. It was a condition even high-level Physicians couldn't cure, but the Marrow Cleansing Pill has accomplished it.\u201dSeeing the people below show incomparably shocked expressions, Elder Ye threw out even more shocking news: \u201cThere's also a very important point, and that is, after Young Miss Lou consumed the Marrow Cleansing Pill, other than eradicating her Terminal Meridians Constitution and unblocking her meridians, she also more than doubled the width of her meridians.\u201cThis was also what this old man personally confirmed just now. The meridians in her body are indeed more than twice the width of ordinary people. So what did this mean? This meant that after taking the Marrow Cleansing Pill and improving your constitution, the speed of absorbing the Spiritual Force of Heaven and earth would also be much faster than others. This is definitely something you could ask to meet but not ask to obtain1. I won't need to say much more as I'm sure everyone knows its value now.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThe news provided by Elder Ye completely stunned the audience, and even the experts in the private rooms displayed a burning desire, wanting to put this Marrow Cleansing Pill away into their own pockets.After Elder Ye introduced the effects of the Marrow Cleansing Pill, he handed the auction back over to Ni Jun and sat down in the audience to participate in the bidding.Ni Jun was also tempted, but he didn't have the strength and financial resources, so he could only adjust his mentality, put on a smile, and start the auction according to Elder Ye's instructions.The Ming Alliance of Merchants didn't stipulate that their members couldn't participate in the auction. On the contrary, if a member did participate, then during the transaction, they could enjoy a two percent discount. This was also a benefit for the members of the Alliance of Merchants.There were countless Sword Masters that wanted to join the Ming Alliance of Merchants but those that were successful were as rare as phoenix feathers and qi'lin horns2. One needed both good resources, and naturally, the ability.\u201cI believe that what Elder Ye said is very clear, and everyone must understand the value of this Marrow Cleansing Pill. I won't say much more now. Let the bidding begin. The starting price is ten million ink-gold coins.\u201dAs soon as Ni Jun's voice fell, the bidding started one after another: \u201cTwenty million.\u201d\u201cThirty million.\u201d\u201cFifty million.\u201d\u201cEighty million.\u201dThe price continued to climb and when it was near the end, Elder Ye also bid: \u201cOne hundred million.\u201dBut the price of one hundred million didn't stop the enthusiasm of those participating as the price was still rising wildly.\u201cOne hundred and ten million.\u201d\u201cOne hundred and twenty million.\u201d\u201cTwo hundred million.\u201d The price of two hundred million exploded from a private room.Elder Ye cast his gaze towards that private room, and a sliver of understanding rose in his eyes, but it didn't stop his desire for the Marrow Cleansing Pill, \u201cTwo hundred and thirty million.\u201d\u201cTwo hundred and fifty million.\u201d\u201cTwo hundred and sixty million.\u201d Suddenly, another person joined from another private room.\u201cTwo hundred and seventy million.\u201d Elder Ye continued.\u201cTwo hundred and eighty million.\u201d There was slight rage in this voice, probably because it had reached their baseline.The person in the other room fell silent, then continued: \u201cTwo hundred and ninety million.\u201d\u201cThree hundred million.\u201d Elder Ye's face changed slightly, but his tone was still relaxed. He had gained a lot of savings since joining the Ming Alliance of Merchants over the years, so it was fine.The price exceeded the baseline of the other party, and in the end, the other two people in their private rooms had no choice but to stop. After all, in a small, medium-strength country like Yan'zhou Country, there were very few people who could take out more than three hundred million ink-gold coins.In the end, Elder Ye won the Marrow Cleansing Pill for 'three hundred million' ink-gold coins. Several people pitied that they missed the Marrow Cleansing Pill because they didn't bring enough ink-gold coins and decided to enquire about the origin of the pill after the auction.1it's so rare it's practically unobtainable for the majority of the population.2popular idiom meaning something is very, very scarce or rare. Qi'lin is often translated as 'unicorn', but it's not quite right, because a unicorn is a separate creature in China (\u72ec\u89d2\u517d) so I'm leaving the original pin'yin. The idiom is \u51e4\u6bdb\u9e9f\u89d2, but if I just said 'lin horns' it doesn't quite make sense so yeah.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They cast enviable gazes towards her. In an instant she became a wealthy woman. Even if they were given some time to go gather money, they wouldn't be able to come up with this much ink-gold coins.Yun Jin proudly flaunted to the several people: \u201cLooks like I made a profit. It's actually worth three hundred million ink-gold coins!\u201dLooking at the handsome face of Yun Jin's that was asking for a beating, Yun Luo couldn't help but give him an 'are you an idiot' look. But he was still very envious within\u2014though it wasn't that he was envious of this cousin obtaining a pill that cost three hundred million, but the fact that he obtained\u00a0the\u00a0Marrow Cleansing Pill.Xiao Zi Ang also couldn't help but roll his eyes at Yun Jin who revealed a face full of cockiness. But inside, he also desperately yearned for that Marrow Cleansing Pill.After today's auction, the Marrow Cleansing Pill would become a sensation throughout the entire Yan'zhou Country, and even spread to other countries on Tian'ling Continent. It would become even more difficult to obtain one then.There was killing intent hidden in Gu Yan Ran's eyes. She couldn't understand why the sky and the earth had turned upside down1\u00a0in only less than three months for Lou Mu Yan. Aside from her own family background, she was better than Lou Mu Yan in every way, so why wasn't she the one that obtained that Marrow Cleansing Pill? How hateful she felt!Lou Mu Yan naturally felt the killing intent from Gu Yan Ran towards her. But as a once-almighty cultivator of the Cultivation World, it was impossible for her to worry about an inferior enemy like her. After the Academy's annual competition, she would properly 'serve' this self-righteous little white flower.The Seventh Princess Yun Xin was also exceptionally envious of Lou Mu Yan, and even felt a little unfair, disliking Lou Mu Yan more and more. On the surface she continued to wear a gentle smile, but she decided that after returning home, she would definitely discuss this properly with her Consort Mother. Even if she didn't like Lou Mu Yan, it would still be beneficial to win her over somehow.As a princess of the Empire, and also as an influential and popular student of the Imperial Academy's Heaven Class, Yun Xin naturally didn't like her limelight to be overshadowed by a woman that was known amongst the distinguished clans as trash in the past. But she also understood how to endure while holding great desire and determination for the Marrow Cleansing Pill.Chi Yi Xuan's face sunk. He was actually very conflicted. He hoped that Lou Mu Yan was dazzling, and yet he also wanted to hide her away so that she would only shine for him.After the auction ended, Lou Mu Yan carried the Spirit Devourer to a separate transaction room of the Ming Alliance of Merchants to clear the deal.\u201cYoung Miss Lou has arrived. Sit.\u201d Elder Ye waited with a smile on his face in the room, appearing very happy to have been able to win the Marrow Cleansing Pill.Lou Mu Yan's lips curled up into a smile: \u201cCongratulations Elder Ye, maybe Elder Ye could even advance to a Sword Monarch expert after cleansing your marrows.\u201d\u201cHAHA\u2014!\u201d Hearing Lou Mu Yan's words, Elder Ye was put in a good mood. He had been stuck at the Peak-Phase Sword King Stage for more than twenty years. If he could really utilise the Marrow Cleansing Pill's effects to cleanse his marrow and widen his meridians, then he had confidence in breaking through to the Sword Monarch Stage.\u201cThen I'll accept Young Miss Lou's auspicious words. If this old man successfully advances into the Sword Monarch Stage, then I'll consider it as owing a personal favour to Young Miss Lou.\u201dLou Mu Yan didn't expect Elder Ye to be this straightforward. A Sword Monarch's personal favour was hard to obtain, particularly becoming acquainted with someone like Elder Ye who was also a high-level Appraiser. Since the other party extended an olive branch2\u00a0then she'd naturally accept it, \u201cThen I'll accept it with thick skin.\u201dElder Ye nodded appreciatively. He usually disliked hypocritical people, so seeing that Lou Mu Yan could judge the hour and size up the situation3, was not being hypocritical, and possessed a likable temperament, he felt fonder of this little girl.\u201cYoung Miss Lou, your Marrow Cleansing Pill was sold for three hundred million ink-gold coins. After deducting the two percent commission fee for the Ming Alliance of Merchants, as well as the price of the Fire Cloud Mink you bought, this is the rest.\u201d Elder Ye took out a purple crystal card, ready to transfer the money over.Lou Mu Yan took out her purple crystal card and handed it to Elder Ye, \u201cElder Ye, could I exchange the ink-gold coins into purple-gold coins?\u201dIn reality, ink-gold coins weren't that valuable on this land and only in a small country like Yan'zhou Country did three hundred million ink-gold coins appear to be a huge amount of wealth.\u201cNaturally.\u201d Elder Ye took the card and directly converted the ink-gold coins to purple-gold coins and transferred it to her card.\u201cThank you!\u201d Lou Mu Yan put the card away, smiling.Remembering that at the end of the auction many people who had even a bit of power to them came to him and enquired about the person who sold the Marrow Cleansing Pill, he reminded: \u201cYoung Miss Lou, this Marrow Cleansing Pill already made many people with some background notice you, so you must be more careful.\u201dAfter Lou Mu Yan allowed him to release the news that her Terminal Meridians constitution was eradicated after consuming the Marrow Cleansing Pill, he believed that many people would go find her, and even the Lou Clan, if they couldn't obtain news off of him.Lou Mu Yan nodded and said: \u201cThank you Elder Ye for the reminder. I know this is unavoidable, so I'm already prepared.\u201dEven if she didn't take out the Marrow Cleansing Pill today, the fact that her Terminal Meridians constitution was eradicated, and the fact that she advanced to a Great Sword Master, would still attract a lot of attention. Instead of being targeted by a small number of powerful entities that could secretly make trouble for the Lou Clan, it was better to let everyone know about the existence of the Marrow Cleansing Pill.\u201cIt's good to be prepared. If Young Miss Lou still has any pills or other rare items to sell, do remember to come to the Ming Alliance of Merchants to find this old man. Of course, you can also find other managers with your Silver Ming Alliance Token.\u201d Elder Ye felt that Lou Mu Yan was mysterious, had many secrets, and definitely had more nice items.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cBut of course. If I have anything good, the first place I'll definitely think of is the Ming Alliance of Merchants. After all, no other Alliance could compare to the Ming Alliance of Merchants in terms of credibility and strength.\u201d\u201cThen that's the best. This old man awaits the next opportunity to work with Young Miss Lou.\u201d\u201cMu Yan also looks forward to our next cooperation.\u201d Lou Mu Yan stood up, smiling, and said: \u201cElder Ye, my cousin and the others are awaiting outside, so I won't bother you anymore. Let us meet again.\u201d\u201cAlright! Let us meet again.\u201dNot long after Lou Mu Yan left, a red figure appeared in the room.Seeing the visitor, Elder Ye greeted respectfully: \u201cYour Highness!\u201d\u201cDid you give her the silver token?\u201d The man's voice was clear with a sense of maturity.\u201cYes, I have given it to her.\u201d Elder Ye nodded.\u201cThat Marrow Cleansing Pill was won by you?\u201d\u201cYes. If this Marrow Cleansing Pill really does have the effects that Lou Mu Yan said, then I will have a little more confidence breaking through to the Sword Monarch Stage.\u201d The excitement hidden in Elder Ye's eyes didn't escape the man's eyes.The red-clothed man chuckled softly, and his thin lips opened, \u201cYou can rest assured. That Marrow Cleansing Pill does indeed have the effect she said.\u201dElder Ye never doubted his master's ability, \u201cWho knows where that little girl obtained the Marrow Cleansing Pill. It is a pity that she gave the remaining two away.\u201dBefore Lou Mu Yan left, he went to enquire again if she could sell one more, but the answer given was that she already gifted them to Yun Lan and Yun Jin. He sure didn't know if the little girl was too generous, or she had a deeper meaning to her actions.The red-clothed man's lips curled upwards with an incomparably devilish charm, \u201cShe's extremely shrewd. It's best to be more friendly with the Lou Clan from now on.\u201dSince working at the Ming Alliance of Merchants, Elder Ye had never seen his proud and uninhibited master ever order them to attempt to befriend anyone, let alone see him pay attention to and care about anyone.Despite the many questions he had, he didn't dare ask them aloud, and took his words to heart. Since his master saw promise in Lou Mu Yan, then later he would order the person in charge of the Alliance in Yan'zhou Country to be as friendly to the Lou Clan as possible.\u201cYes. I will pass on the order to befriend the Lou Clan.\u201d\u201cFrom now on, send me a copy of all the news about her.\u201d Ming Xiu curled his lips. Others didn't know, but he knew that the Marrow Cleansing Pill was definitely refined by Lou Mu Yan herself. That little woman was becoming more and more interesting.\u201cYes, master.\u201d1everything changed so drastically, a 180-degree change.2this one's an English saying originating from Ancient Greece and Ancient Egypt (according to my few seconds long Google search). But Chinese also appear to say it a lot and it means like a show of peace and friendship.3knows what to say and do, and when to say and do them in the appropriate moments.Note: So all I did today was stay up till 3:30am binge watching You Are My Glory and finally finished all 32 episodes (would've finished the episodes earlier if I didn't keep pressing the back arrow and pause button and swoon over and over again at certain scenes HAHA).So today I'll just post 1 chapter because I'm running out of chapters I've saved up :p. Also, I recommend this c-drama. It can definitely be boring to some though, but the simplicity of the plot and relationships explored is beautiful and what I love about it. It's practically an angst-free, mature drama, with mature characters, but still a rom-com, just not your typical one.Oh! To those who haven't watched it and like rom-coms, if it will give you a better idea of its feel, I can tell you for a fact that it's based on the novel written by Gu Man who wrote the novel that Love o2o was based on. Except this is a bit more mature than o2o, exploring real-life issues, but with humour and nothing too dramatic. Also Gu Man is actually the scriptwriter for YAMG, so you can totally expect that the plot, characterisation etc. will follow the novel and the author's intentions and won't be butchered like many of the novel-to-cdrama adaptations. I haven't read the novel and might not for now since I'm more in the mood of reading xianxia novels, but may pick it up to read one day.Side note: The main character, Yu Tu, in YAMG is played by Yang Yang, who's also the same actor who played Xiao Nai in o2o and Ye Xiu in The King's Avatar. And why I mentioned these dramas specifically is because I want to ask: Why does Yang Yang keep playing roles with e-sports? HAHA Absolutely not complaining though, I enjoy watching dramas with e-sports and would LOVE to see more of Yang Yang. I personally give TKA a 10/10. YAMG might be a 9/10 personally for me and maybe an\u2026 8.5 or 9/10 for o2o? Can't wait till The King's Avatar 2 comes out though!Side side note: Oh yeah, he also acted as Lin Dong in the drama Martial Universe adapted from the novel Wu Dong Qian Kun, but as much as I love cultivation novels, I was never interested in that novel, so I didn't watch the drama either. But just an fyi.Oops, I went on and on, but last point: Honestly, I can't get enough of Yang Yang and his posture and handsome looks XD Hmmm what should I watch next\u2026 Time to go cdrama hunting again!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 37: A Bet with the Sword\u00a0MonarchAfter Lou Mu Yan left the transaction area, she went to join Yun Lan and the rest.As soon as she exited the door of the Ming Alliance of Merchants, she saw a burly, middle-aged man and a black-clothed, skinny old man stop Yun Lan and the others in their steps. When she thought about it, she easily guessed who they were.\u201cMu Yan, how about I send you back to the General's Mansion.\u201d Yun Lan found Lou Mu Yan walking out towards them from the entrance and gave her a surreptitious, meaningful look.Just now, the King of Zhen'xi asked them who bought the Fire Cloud Mink, and although he desperately tried to hide it, but Gu Yan Ran told them, and now they could only send Lou Mu Yan away first.Lou Mu Yan nodded with a smile: \u201cSure!\u201dAlthough she said that, she knew that things wouldn't be that simple today\u2014she wouldn't be able to leave easily.\u201cWhy be in such a rush?\u201d The King of Zhen'xi stretched out his arm to stop Yun Lan. He still had business to settle, so how could he allow Yun Lan to take the person away.Then he swept his gaze to Lou Mu Yan, examining her. With a light purple dress, hair worn in a simplistic style, indifference in her eyes, an elegant and otherworldly temperament, and a beautiful face without powder, even if she was rather young, she had the disposition of one who's capable of causing the downfall of a country1.Lou Mu Yan was one of the very few people whose appearance he considered pleasing to the eye. But it was a pity that this beauty was Lou Mo Yu's daughter\u2014he couldn't touch her.\u201cThis is General Lou's daughter, correct?\u201d Yun Tian Zong had seen Lou Mu Yan before, but she didn't leave any impressions at the time.What he knew more deeply was Lou Mu Yan's reputation as trash, which he often used to ridicule Lou Mo Yu.\u201cKing of Zhen'xi.\u201d Lou Mu Yan nodded, with apathy and distance.She didn't want to show any looks of goodwill to her father's enemy, not to mention the man's wanton gaze made her feel exceptionally unpleasant. A killing intent rose in her heart.\u201cYou won the Fire Cloud Mink?\u201d Yun Tian Zong hadn't yet spoken when the skinny old man in black asked Lou Mu Yan first.Lou Mu Yan's expression didn't change as she nodded: \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHand it over to this old man now, what this old man said before is still valid. I owe you a personal favour.\u201d The black-clothed old man was expressionless with a sharp look in his eyes.\u201cApologies, Senior, this Junior's answer remains the same.\u201d Wanting to take advantage of his seniority and age and bully the weak\u2014as if she'd allow that.\u201cLittle girl, this old man is a Sword Monarch expert! Didn't your father teach you the principle of being kind to others?\u201d The black-clothed old man's eyes were full of displeasure and a pressure that only belonged to the strong spread from him. Ever since he advanced to a Sword Monarch, there were fewer people who didn't give him any face.Lou Mu Yan's lips curled into a smile, and yet it couldn't be considered a smile. One couldn't understand what she was feeling as she looked at the man's eyes fearlessly, \u201cPresumably Senior also understands the rules of an auction, right? The person with the highest price wins the item. This has been the unchanging principle since old times. If Senior must snatch the Fire Cloud Mink from me in front of the Ming Alliance of Merchant's entrance today, then this Junior has nothing to say.\u201dSo what if he was a Sword Monarch? She's really had enough. Everyone just wanted to step on her these days, what's that all about.She wouldn't tolerate and compromise, but in the face of absolute strength, she wouldn't have a brain cramp2\u00a0and directly engage in battle with this Sword Monarch.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cJust what do you want done so that you can give this Fire Cloud Mink to this old man?\u201d The black-clothed old man's face sank. His hoarse voice carried with it a little anger, and the pressure he exuded thickened a little.Lou Mu Yan narrowed her eyes, straightened her back and bore the pressure the black-clothed old man deliberately released upon her. A layer of sweat rose on her nose and her face grew slightly pale.It was the first time that she had faced a pressure from a Sword Monarch expert by herself. The gap between three major Stages truly wasn't a joke! The pressure alone already made her unable to move her feet. If they really did start fighting, then that old man could seriously take her little life in minutes!Yun Lan's clenched hands were full of cold sweat. This strong Sword Monarch expert's face was as thin as sticks, his complexion was slightly green, and hidden in his eyes was an ominous glint and viciousness. This person probably practiced skills relating to the Path of the Ghost, had an unpredictable temperament, and was definitely cruel and ruthless.He couldn't let Lou Mu Yan be in danger, but it was inconvenient to leave, so he surreptitiously gave Yun Jin a look.Yun Jin nodded gently. What Yun Lan worried about was what he was worried about. Looking up, he saw that the Sword Monarch didn't even care about the rest of them, so he silently retreated through the crowd of people and returned to the Ming Alliance of Merchants to ask for help.After a short stalemate, Lou Mu Yan saw that the other party's face was covered in a shadow and his eyes revealed more and more impatience. With a thought, the palm-sized little white beast landed in her hands, then she smiled at the old man lightly, \u201cSenior, how about we make a bet.\u201d\u201cWhat bet?\u201d The black-clothed old man glanced at the little white beast with a flame of desire in his eyes. Then he raised his eyes and looked at Lou Mu Yan to see what sort of tricks she wanted to play.\u201cSince this little beast is important to both of us, then why not see what it chooses, how about that?\u201d Lou Mu Yan smiled generously and said: \u201cIf the Fire Cloud Mink recognises Senior as its master, then I will give it directly to Senior, without taking a cent and I won't need Senior to owe me that personal favour.\u201cBut if it still chooses this Junior, then it proves that it is more fated with this Junior. I ask that Senior let go when that happens.\u201d Lou Mu Yan didn't forget the appropriate respect that should be given to experts, but her attitude and tone was neither humble nor haughty.The black-clothed old man's lips curled up slightly. He probed the Fire Cloud Mink's forehead using his Mental Energy and discovered that nothing suspicious had been done to its Sea of Consciousness, so he nodded: \u201cFine!\u201dHe secretly laughed at Lou Mu Yan's naivety. Everyone only knew that he was a Sword Monarch expert, but they didn't know that he was also a Spirit Beast Master! It was just a Tier 2 Demonic Beast. Even if he was only a low-level Spirit Beast Master, he could still easily obtain it.\u201cThen, Senior, please.\u201d Lou Mu Yan's lips curled up, placed the little beast on the floor, then took a few steps back.Because the auction just ended, there were many people who were attracted by the news of their bet, and those that wanted to watch a show all stopped and crowded around.Seeing Lou Mu Yan's actions, they guessed that she wanted to yield the Fire Cloud Mink to the Sword Monarch expert. But to give herself a proper way out of the embarrassing situation, she made such a meaningless bet.Gu Yan Ran's clenched hands beneath her sleeves suddenly loosened and her eyes revealed a sense of gloating. For a Demonic Beast, she even dared to offend a Sword Monarch expert. Lou Mu Yan was truly an idiot. When the time came when she lost her bet, it was like losing one's army on top of losing one's wife3. She'd just wait to watch this trash start crying when the time came.And at this time, Ming Xiu, who was about to exit the Ming Alliance of Merchants with Elder Ye, stopped in his steps. He watched with interest as he folded his arms and leaned against a stone pillar at the entrance.Seeing his master suddenly stop, Elder Ye looked at Ming Xiu, befuddled and asked: \u201cYour Highness?\u201d\u201cLet's take a look first.\u201d Ming Xiu cast his gaze on Lou Mu Yan. He sure wanted to see what tricks this little woman would use to win this bet.1idiom describing a devastatingly beautiful woman. A woman so beautiful that she could make monarchs focus solely on her and disregard their land and people, causing their country's downfall.2Chinese equivalent to 'brain fart'. So in this context, she won't do stupid things.3Chinese idiom meaning suffering a double loss after trying to outsmart the enemy as the enemy outsmarted them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 38: Monarch\u00a0MingThe black-clothed old man took a couple of steps forward and lifted the Fire Cloud Mink from the ground, a strange smile on his face.He chanted an incantation to subdue the Demonic Beast. After chanting, he cut his index finger with a wind blade made from Elemental Energy, then dripped a drop of blood onto the little beast's flame-like cluster of hair.With a faint smile on Lou Mu Yan's face, she folded her arms and watched the black-clothed old man's performance, with ridicule in the depths of her eyes.With this old man's meagre ability, he still wanted to subdue the Spirit Devourer? It truly was a daydream.A cup of tea's worth of time had passed, yet the drop of blood on the Fire Cloud Mink's forehead still hadn't been absorbed into its body. The black-clothed old man was startled, and his eyes filled with a hazy shadow.He took out a red talisman from his interspatial ring, continued to mutter the incantation, then he tapped with his thin fingers and the red talisman entered the little beast's body.Afterwards, he formed a Seal in the air that carried strong Elemental Energy and forcibly inserted it into the little beast's Sea of Consciousness. The drop of blood on its forehead squirmed a few times.A bright light shone from his turbid eyes. This was his trump card as a Spirit Beast Tamer for contracting beasts. He didn't believe that he couldn't handle a mere Tier 2 Demonic Beast.Just when everyone thought that the drop of blood would successfully merge with the Fire Cloud Mink's body, there was a sudden change. The black-clothed old man's blood essence directly burst on top of the little beast's forehead, turning into more than a dozen little droplets of blood that splattered onto the old man's face. Meanwhile, the Fire Cloud Mink's entire body began to twitch as if it were ill.Disbelief surfaced in the black-clothed old man's eyes. What? He actually failed. How could that be possible.\u201cSqueak\u2026\u201dWith the black-clothed old man failing to contract the beast, the little beast in his hand not only twitched, but frothed at its mouth and its four small paws curled together, whimpering.Those present who knew a Spirit Beast Master had all guessed the reason for the little beast's current reaction. Only when Spirit Beast Masters failed in their forced contract would the Demonic Beast's meridians and internal organs be harmed, then finally convulse until death.Seeing this sort of reaction from the Spirit Devourer in the black-clothed old man's hand, Lou Mu Yan's faint smile vanished, and a coldness replaced it.\u201cSenior, can you now return the Fire Cloud Mink to me?\u201d Lou Mu Yan suppressed the cold killing intent that emerged in her heart and asked expressionlessly.The pain suffered by her Demonic Beast today would definitely be returned to this damned old bastard tenfold.\u201cHumph, what's the use of a Demonic Beast that couldn't even withstand a Contract Seal.\u201d The black-clothed old man felt exceptionally displeased right now. He actually failed to contract it in front of so many people.His eyes grew cold, and he quickly condensed a wind blade that carried a strong pressure in his palm. With a swing, the wind blade left his palm and shot towards the little beast's forehead.As if sensing a dangerous power, the little beast's body trembled, attempting to avoid it. But because of its limited strength, it was ultimately restrained by the black-clothed Sword Monarch, unmovable, and could only wait for death.Right when the onlookers saw that the wind blade was about to fall onto the Fire Cloud Mink's head, they all sighed with pity at what a waste it was to kill a Demonic Beast that was worth one hundred million.Yet who knew that at that moment, a misty fire suddenly appeared in front of the black-clothed old man, holding a jade pendant Magic Tool to block the wind blade, only for it to instantly split into numerous halves.But Lou Mu Yan's wrist blocked the little beast's head, stopping the fatal blow. However, her wrist was marked with a deep bloody wound, and blood flowed down incessantly.At this moment, everyone's eyes were focused on the light purple figure. Blood fell drop by drop from her slender, white arms onto the little beast's pure white fur, then slowly bloomed, as scarlet and dazzling as a red spider lily that grew on the shores in the netherworld.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksMing Xiu's face beneath the mask was fearfully grim, and the coldness in his eyes was evidently apparent, as if it would condense into frost.\u201cSenior, can you return my Demonic Beast to me now?\u201d Lou Mu Yan didn't look at the wound on her wrist, but instead looked directly at the black-clothed old man, her gaze cold, as she emphasised each word.The black-clothed old man was startled by the coldness in her eyes, then huffed coldly. This girl suddenly gave him a very dangerous and strange feeling\u2014she could not be left alive.As soon as her voice fell, he gathered Elemental Energy in his palm, then extended his arm to strike Lou Mu Yan's chest.The black-clothed old man practiced ghostly skills from the Yin Sect, so he was exceptionally sensitive to danger. Such inexplicable feelings of unease helped him escape numerous life and death catastrophes.His principle in life was that he would rather kill mistakenly than let anyone go, and when it was necessary to kill, then he definitely wouldn't be soft. So he pretended to be infuriated by Lou Mu Yan's actions and released the pressure of a Sword Monarch to its entirety, \u201cYou dare to stop and provoke this old man, you're seeking death1.\u201dLou Mu Yan was also infuriated. This damned old bastard was truly pushing her buttons. She closed her eyes, then a silver Talisman Sealcondensed in her Sea of Consciousness.Taking advantage of the fact that the black-clothed old man was unprepared, she utilised her Flash Step to its maximum, grabbed the little beast with one hand, then after her phantom flashed a few times, the strong palm strike unexpectedly missed its target.But the speed between the two was too fast, so many of the spectators didn't see clearly, and before they even had time to recall the movements just now, the black-clothed old man took action once again.A long sword appeared in his hand, then he frantically channelled his Elemental Energy into the sword. Today, he must cut down this girl that dared challenge his superiority, and who could become a hidden danger in the future.After the sword made a [buzz] sound, he slashed down in the air, and a sword aura that carried violent energy cut down like the autumn gale that swept the fallen leaves2.Where the sword aura passed, cracks spread in zigzags across the limestone flooring. The crowd all felt the terror of the sword aura and surmised that Lou Mu Yan was over.\u201cMu Yan!\u201d Yun Lan yelled, but even he couldn't stop the trajectory of the sword aura.Lou Mu Yan narrowed her eyes and continued to form seals with her hands, and a large web much like a spider's detached from her Sea of Consciousness.The strength of a Sword Monarch definitely couldn't be underestimated. Her face gradually paled as her Spiritual Energy was rapidly being deprived, but a blue Mental Energy tempest was forming in her Sea of Consciousness.Just when her Mental Energy was about to exit and turn into a physical shield, a sudden earth-shattering pressure fell from the sky and easily destroyed the black-clothed old man's sword aura.\u201cHow bold! To dare fight in front of our Ming Alliance of Merchant's door and destroy my shop's fa\u00e7ade. It is unforgivable.\u201d A powerful voice resounded across the sky, and the entire Imperial Capital was shocked by it.As soon as the voice fell, a giant palm of raging fire fell from the sky and headed directly for the black-clothed old man.The black-clothed old man felt that the energy contained in the blazing palm was exceptionally terrifying. Despite being aghast, his hands weren't leisurely as he immediately threw out a shield into the air to block his front, then added a barrier made of Elemental Energy that covered his entire body.Except, the moment the earth-shattering blazing palm landed, it easily broke through his shield, then struck his chest, and the Elemental Energy barrier collapsed in an instant.\u201cPU!!\u201d The black-clothed old man stumbled back a few steps upon being hit before stopping, and he couldn't help but spit out a mouthful of blood.His body trembled slightly with terror in his eyes as he watched the person walk over from not far away and addressed: \u201cM-Monarch Ming\u2026\u201d1Random side note: I wonder how many times I avoided writing 'courting death' by changing it to 'seeking death' HAHA. The memes I've seen on xianxia Facebook groups have made me conscious of it XD. I've used 'courting' a couple of times, though, I'm pretty sure. I'll use them interchangeably.2very fast and powerful.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In just a moment, the bluestone1\u00a0flooring's cracks slowly closed and was restored to its original state.Upon seeing this, Lou Mu Yan retracted the secret skill she was about to use, and the spider-thread-like Mental Energy also dispersed into nothingness, submerged in her Sea of Consciousness, as if it had never appeared before.\u201cWoman, you owe This Highness another favour.\u201d A male voice with a sense of magnetic maturity brushed past Lou Mu Yan's ears like a spring breeze.The coldness in Lou Mu Yan's eyes was replaced by a faint smile\u2014it was indeed Ming Xiu, that devilish man, that acted.When the giant blazing palm struck, she felt the Elemental Energy fluctuation belonged to Ming Xiu, and an inexplicable sense of trust rose in her heart.Lou Mu Yan turned around upon sensing something and raised her eyes to see the valiant, tall, and imposing man, wearing a silver mask, elegantly walk over.His red robe danced flamboyantly with the wind, and a domineering aura naturally exuded from him, defeating all the men present. Others were like his foil, just like how the light of fireflies could never compete with the bright moon.\u201cMonarch Ming!\u201d The black-clothed old man clutched his chest, his face extremely ugly, while his eyes revealed slight fear. He was afraid of this man that walked towards him from the bottom of his heart.Monarch Ming, the Highness of the Nine-Layer Hall2\u00a0that the Ming Alliance of Merchants was subordinate to. His identity and strength were mysterious and unfathomable, while he acted on whatever he felt like doing, and even had the nickname 'God of Murder'. Amongst the Sword Monarchs, he was unmatched, and even Sword Sovereigns didn't dare provoke him.Ming Xiu looked askance at him, his voice as cold as water: \u201cYou recognise this Highness?\u201d\u201cThe name of Monarch Ming has long resounded throughout Tian'ling Continent. Although this old man has never met Your Highness, but I have already heard of Your Highness's deeds.\u201d The black-clothed old man barely managed a smile while his posture remained very low.Rumour had it that Monarch Ming always wore a flamboyant red robe with a silver, dark-patterned mask, was arbitrary, arrogant, and tyrannical, and upon first glance, it was indeed as such.Seeing the complete reversal of attitude by the black-clothed old man, treating the red-clothed man with respect, the crowd of onlookers wondered: who was this man who had a noble and impressive temperament?It was no wonder that the people present didn't know the name of Monarch Ming. Although he had long become famous throughout Tian'ling Continent, but that was mainly limited to the high-level Sword Masters. Those Sword Masters beneath Sword Monarch Stage had no way of engaging in many of the land's secrets.\u201cHumph, you've heard of this Highness's name and yet you still dare be so impudent at the entrance to the Ming Alliance of Merchants. Aren't you very good!\u201d Ming Xiu's voice carried a chill and people couldn't help but shudder.\u201cI did not indent to offend Monarch Ming. I simply had some disputes with a junior, so I do hope that Monarch Ming does not blame me.\u201d The black-clothed old man bent slightly. He could only bow his head in front of formidable strength.Towards Monarch Ming, the black-clothed old man couldn't afford to resist or disrespect him. This man's power was unfathomable, his behaviour was devilish and cold, and his temperament was even more capricious than those from the Ghost Sects. Regardless of who provoked him, they'd end up worse than death.Ming Xiu looked askance at Lou Mu Yan and a rare expression of a smile rose in his narrow phoenix eyes. With a flip of his hand, a medicine bottle appeared in his palm.\u201cIt is the negligence of my Ming Alliance of Merchants to allow Young Miss Lou to have been threatened the moment you stepped out of the entrance, right after participating in our auction. Consider this bottle of medicine as an apology.\u201d Ming Xiu's voice was cold and indifferent, and one couldn't hear any emotions. He handed the bottle in his palm to Lou Mu Yan, \u201cThis Highness will give Young Miss Lou an explanation.\u201dLou Mu Yan rolled her eyes inwardly\u2014he sure could act. But she was close to being in the limelight because of the Marrow Cleansing Pill, so if this devilish man displayed any hint that they recognised each other, then that'd be an even bigger problem.\u201cThank you Monarch Ming!\u201d Lou Mu Yan respectfully reached out her hand and took the medicine bottle, pulled off its cap then and there and shook the light-yellow medicinal powder onto her wound.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksAs soon as the wound on the wrist came into contact with the medicinal powder, the blood naturally stopped. The burning sensation also vanished and was replaced by a refreshing sensation. As expected, she knew this devil's items would be extraordinary. He just casually took out a bottle and it was powder from crushed Grade 3 healing pills.The black-clothed old man's heart thumped erratically, and the strong sense of unease grew even stronger. He secretly regretted attacking Lou Mu Yan at the entrance to the Ming Alliance of Merchants and should've snuck into the Lou Mansion at night, kidnap the beast and kill her.\u201cAs a Sword Monarch, even if you aren't ashamed of attacking a kid at the Great Sword Master Stage, this Highness feels it to be irksome.\u201dMing Xiu stretched out his hand lazily and clapped twice. Two masked men in black exuding the pressure of an expert suddenly appeared from the shadows, carrying a dangerous aura. Their cultivation base was also above the old man.\u201cMaster!\u201d The two knelt respectfully and awaited Ming Xiu's order.\u201cGive him to the Law Enforcement Unit. Those who dared provoke the Alliance must be punished according to the law.\u201dThe Ming Alliance of Merchants had announced several rules of theirs long ago, and even organised a special Law Enforcement Unit that specifically punished those that dared provoke the Alliance, or those that had malicious intents towards the Alliance. After being arrested, they wouldn't be killed, but they definitely wouldn't end up nice.Upon hearing Monarch Ming's plan to give him to the Law Enforcement Unit, terror rose in the black-clothed old man's heart. He knew about that place, and heard that after entering, living was worse than death, and no one would be able to exit without peeling a few layers of skin3.\u201cPlease be merciful, Monarch Ming! I am the Outer Elder of our Yin Sect and plead of Your Highness to not bother with this matter considering our sect. I will never offend the Ming Alliance of Merchants next time.\u201d The black-clothed old man's posture was very low. Even though he was a Sword Monarch, but in front of Monarch Ming, he was nothing. He didn't dare provoke this arrogant and domineering man at all.Ming Xiu squinted at the black-clothed old man\u2014greedy for life and fearful of death, it truly was a waste of his cultivation as a Sword Monarch. Normally he'd be too lazy to take action, but this time this person hurt Lou Mu Yan, which made him exceptionally displeased. He was unforgivable.\u201cTake him away.\u201d Ming Xiu waved his hand casually at his two subordinates.\u201cMonarch Ming, you cannot treat me like this! I am a member of the Yin Sect, don't you push people too far.\u201d The black-clothed man was essentially a Sword Monarch. He was already disgraced enough from acting so lowly before, yet Monarch Ming still didn't give him any face.\u201cSo what about the Ying Sect? It has never entered this Highness's eyes.\u201d Ming Xiu huffed coldly. He had long been displeased with the Yin Sect. So what if he killed him in public, let alone just throwing him to the law Enforcement Unit?The black-clothed old man's heart sank. He mobilised all the Elemental Energy he had and gathered it in his palm, then bit his fingertip until it bled and quickly chanted an incantation. He'd attempt to escape using the Yin Sect's escape skill, the Blood Elusion Skill. If he could successfully escape, then he wouldn't be forcefully captured by the Ming Alliance of Merchant's Law Enforcement Unit. As for how to deal with the arrest order given by the Ming Alliance of Merchants, he would think of it later.A ray of blood-red light slowly emerged from the black-clothed old man. Just when it was about to envelop him whole, a golden chain flew out from each of the hands of Ming Xiu's two black-clothed subordinate, locking him in place. It even interrupted the secret skill he attempted to use to escape.The black-clothed old man's eyes were full of dismay and attempted to use his sword skills to resist. However, he couldn't utilise any of his Elemental Energy as they were forcefully suppressed by the golden chains, and it was then that horror rose in his eyes.As he was being taken away be the two, the black-clothed old man turned his head and glared at Lou Mu Yan with hostility and killing intent. It was all that little girl's fault today. If he could come out alive from the Ming Alliance of Merchant's Law Enforcement Unit's control, then he must refine her into a mummy to dispel his hatred.Lou Mu Yan sneered\u2014this damned old bastard even had killing intent towards her now, but who knew who'd kill who in the future.The black-clothed Sword Monarch expert being locked by the golden chain, then disappearing with the two men in black caused everyone present to look at Ming Xiu with horror and fear\u2014just who was this man?1minor change from limestone to bluestone.2pretty sure the name of his Hall is a reference to the nine-layers of Heaven in Chinese mythology.3they'd be put through a lot of agony and wouldn't come out unscathed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 40: The Secret Within the Spirit Devourer's BodyMing Xiu didn't care about the glances of the people around him. His long and narrow phoenix eyes looked at Lou Mu Yan deeply, but it was only fleeting, so fast that no one could catch it.He stopped talking, turned, and disappeared from here completely.After Ming Xiu left, Elder Ye walked forward and asked Lou Mu Yan with a gentle smile: \u201cIs Young Miss Lou alright?\u201d\u201cThank you for Elder Ye's concern, I'm fine.\u201d Lou Mu Yan shook her head with a smile.Feeling the trembling of the little beast in her hand grow more and more intense, her eyes sank, but she remained smiling, \u201cElder Ye, I have something to do so I'll leave first.\u201d\u201cThat's fine, please do as you see fit, Young Miss Lou.\u201d Elder Ye noticed the little beast in Lou Mu Yan's hand wasn't in good condition and sighed inwardly\u2014what a pity.Lou Mu Yan nodded, then she took out a wooden whistle that hung around her neck and blew it. In only a few breaths, a bright, white Tailwind Horse appeared in front of everyone.She addressed Yun Lan and the others, then mounted the Tailwind Horse while carrying the Spirit Devourer. She left the premises of the Ming Alliance of Merchants and headed for the Lou Clan.The King of Zhen'xi watched with uncertainty, and his face was so dark it could squeeze out a basin of ink1. He narrowed his eyes, then turned and left from the crowd.After seeing Lou Mu Yan's valiant and admirable back disappear, Yun Lan retrieved his gaze. As soon as he turned his head, he saw the others stare at Lou Mu Yan's back in a daze as well.\u201cLet's go too.\u201d He narrowed his eyes, concealed the strangeness in his eyes, and addressed the others.After Yun Lan and the others left, the crowd exploded as they gathered in threes and pairs before leaving, still discussing what occurred at today's auction.In less than half a day, the news of the Marrow Cleansing Pill appearing at the auction spread throughout the entire Imperial Capital. Large and small distinguished families held their own thoughts on this matter as they sent spies to the General's Mansion to gather intel.The situation on the black-clothed Sword Monarch being severely injured by the mysterious red-clothed, masked man and then thrown to the Law Enforcement Unit, however, was strictly banned from being spoken of in the Empire. Other Sword Masters didn't dare speak of this incident or discuss anything to do with the man who was termed 'Monarch Ming'.However, Lou Mu Yan didn't care for how the outside coveted her Marrow Cleansing Pill. The moment she arrived home, she entered her room and put the trembling little beast on the table.At this time the little beast's four claws were curled up even more. Her face sunk and one hand probed the area of the Spirit Devourer's dan'tian area. She used her Mental Energy to slip inside and inspect deeper.Then she used her Mental Energy to scan the condition of the Spirit Devourer's insides. She discovered that its meridians weren't shattered, and its internal organs were also perfectly well. Then what caused this sort of physical state?As she thought deeply, she once again scrutinized the Spirit Devourer's insides carefully.\u201cHm!\u201d When her Mental Energy accidentally touched the Demonic Beast's Crystal Core, she discovered that its energy was very violent. The Crystal Core's purple colour was at times light, at times dark, extremely unstable.She focused, then pushed a trace of wood attribute Spiritual Energy into the Spirit Devourer's body and calmed the violent energy of the Crystal Core bit by bit. After the Crystal Core's turbulent energy was slowly suppressed by her Spiritual Energy, she used her Mental Energy to probe into the Crystal Core.\u201cIt's actually a Seal2.\u201d Lou Mu Yan was slightly surprised\u2014how was there a Seal in the Crystal Core of the Spirit Devourer?No wonder, when in the private room, she clearly felt an unusual Mental Energy within the Spirit Devourer's body, secretly protecting its internal organs, but felt that the energy disappeared just earlier. So it was the Crystal Core's problem.Seeing the little, round white ball's aura slowly weakening, and its whole body was trembling more severely, as if it would die soon, she took a deep breath and made a bold decision.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksShe drew ten Void Talismans in the air with her Spiritual Energy, then sent them directly into the Spirit Devourer's body, forming a Five-Element Array to break the Seal.Then she sent a sliver of her Mental Energy that carried a little bit of Spiritual Energy into the sealed Crystal Core, and not long after, she found the whereabouts of the energy that formed the Seal.She pushed her Spiritual Energy further in bit by bit, slowly devouring the energy that was enveloped by a black mist.As time passed, Lou Mu Yan's face grew paler, a layer of sweat rose on her forehead, and her long eyelashes on her closed eyes trembled slightly.But her hands weren't idle as one hand stroked the Spirit Devourer and the other formed seals in the air. Numerous Five-Element Arrays appeared in mid-air and converged into a series of five-coloured rays of light that flew into the little beast, enveloping its purple Crystal Core.The black mist that entangled around the purple Crystal Core was swallowed up by her Spiritual Energy, and a dense black thread-like force that wrapped around the Crystal Core was then revealed.Then the Five-Element Arrays entered into the Crystal Core, and a five-coloured light suddenly burst from within the little beast, instantly enveloping the black filamentous force. The two types of energy competed against each other incessantly.Lou Mu Yan clenched her jaw when she saw this, then sent all her remaining Spiritual Energy into the little beast to protect the purple Crystal Core.The key lied in this. Lou Mu Yan suddenly opened her eyes and said softly: \u201cBreak!\u201dAs her voice fell, the five-coloured light flourished and completely annihilated the layer of black filamentous energy on the Crystal Core.When the light dissipated, the Crystal Core suddenly emitted a dazzling purple light, and a force that didn't belong to her burst out of the Crystal Core, instantly destroying the Seal.Lou Mu Yan was startled. She actually felt an aura and pressure that only an adult Spirit Devourer could exude, and a powerful Soul Energy was hidden within the Crystal Core.She looked at it firmly, then immediately cut her fingers and dripped a drop of blood on the Spirit Devourer's head, fusing it with the bright red flame-like fur.She chanted a long, vague, and obscure spell. When she finished her spell, a red and complicated Taoist Seal appeared in the air. She pointed two fingers and the Taoist Seal disappeared together with the blood essence on the Spirit Devourer's forehead under her control, forming a Contract Talisman in the Spirit Devourer's Sea of Consciousness.Before the purple light of the little beast's Crystal Core faded, and while the little beast's Soul Energy had yet to recover, Lou Mu Yan's Contract Talisman successfully contracted the Spirit Devourer through its Sea of Consciousness. Only then did she sigh in relief and retrieved all the Mental Energy she released into the little beast's body and Crystal Core.After a while, the small white beast with its eyes tightly closed suddenly opened them. There was a coldness in its glass-like black eyes.An intangible Mental Energy suddenly pierced Lou Mu Yan's Sea of Consciousness and her head hurt as if it were being pricked by countless fine needles. She quickly guarded her Sea of Consciousness and mobilised her Mental Energy to form a big web, like spider silk, and only then was she able to withstand the enemy's assault.\u201cI saved you, and you want to repay kindness with enmity3?\u201d Lou Mu Yan glared at the Spirit Devourer that had a sudden change in temperament in front of her. Her clear eyes met those cold eyes that were like a deep well.The little beast's eyes showed a humanized look of uncertainty, then after a while, it withdrew the Mental Energy that invaded Lou Mu Yan's Sea of Consciousness.As soon as the Mental Energy disappeared, a cold male voice echoed in her Sea of Consciousness: \u201cYou, a weak human being, dared to sign a contract with this King. You truly deserve death.\u201d1show how angry he is feeling.2this 'Seal' means there's something sealed/locked within this Crystal Core.3idiom that is equivalent to the English 'bite the hand that feeds one'. Pretty straight forward though.Note: I might edit some previous chapters and fix some of the terminology to do with seals and talismans so that it makes more sense. I just did a more in-depth research on baidu and read up the meanings of some of the terminology the author used regarding seals and talismans. Each of the words used have more distinct meanings in Chinese, so I want to try to reflect their distinctiveness in the English translation so it makes more sense. But it might not be the most accurate translation since I only formally studied Chinese for 3 years (though I'm ethnically Chinese) and reading Chinese websites to do with fantasy and magic-related things is still tricky. Anyways, for continuing readers, you'll be able to find explanations of seals and talismans and the related at\u00a0MEIWITA Information\u00a0once I update the page\u2026 sometime soon.

'Deserve death'?\u201d She looked at the Spirit Devourer as if looking at a joke, \u201cI don't know if you've heard of a saying.\u201dThe Spirit Devourer looked up at her firmly with questioning in his eyes.\u201c'A dragon that swims in the shallow waters is taunted by shrimps, a tiger that leaves its forest and ends up in the plains gets bullied by a dog, the cat that's regarded highly is more ferocious than a tiger, and the balding phoenix is even inferior to a chicken1'.\u201d Lou Mu Yan's red lips opened\u2014if she didn't know that there was a problem with this Demonic Beast, then she'd have lived her previous life in vain.The little beast's eyes widened, and a trace of anger flashed in his cold eyes, but, in an instant, his eyes grew dim again.Lou Mu Yan chuckled softly and looked at the Spirit Devourer as she leaned her chin on her hand, \u201cI don't want to enquire about your secrets, but my guess is that you must really want to strengthen yourself right now, right?\u201d\u201cSo what if it's a yes?\u201d There was a haze in the cold eyes of the Spirit Devourer\u2014this woman's intelligence didn't appear to be like someone who's in their teens.\u201cI performed a Contract of Equals Incantation Spell, so we're not in a master-servant relationship.\u201d Lou Mu Yan fell silent, then raised her eyebrows and continued: \u201cHow about we cooperate?\u201dAt first glance, this Spirit Devourer definitely had an extraordinary origin. Just earlier, when the powerful Soul Energy broke away from the Seal, she changed the type of Contract Incantation Spell she used. Towards the strong, she would give them the respect they deserved.She knew that if she forcibly signed a Master-Servant Contract, then she would most likely receive some backlash from the Demonic Beast in the future. Many superior Demonic Beast species would rather die than succumb to being a human's Spirit Pet, so she'd rather dig a hole from the very beginning that it would jump down into willingly2.What she lacked right now were helpers. Since she couldn't really raise a Spirit Pet that had yet to bear wisdom, then she would at least not let go of such an experienced helper.\u201cYou? A human being who's only at the Great Sword Master cultivation base?\u201d There was disdain in the eyes of the Spirit Devourer.\u201cAren't you just a Tier 2 Demonic Beast right now as well. What right do you have to belittle me?\u201d Lou Mu Yan sneered, stood up, then looked down at the Spirit Devourer, \u201cRight now, you have two choices\u2014one, be my Spirit Pet, and we can be in a partnership; or two, if you refuse to accept it, then you can kill yourself.\u201cBut I'll remind you, the Spell that I used for the contract is a lost, ancient Incantation Spell. Even I don't have a way to dispel it. If you want to forcibly break the contract, then don't blame me if you get a backlash.\u201dShe didn't lie about this point. She found this Incantation Spell when she entered a Secret Realm and was an incomplete Contract Spell that was left behind by an Ancient Immortal. It only showed how to contract, but not how to terminate the contract.Compared to ordinary contracts that subdued a Demonic Beast, the advantage of this Incantation Spell was that if a Demonic Beast wanted to forcibly terminate the contract, then it would suffer a very serious backlash, not to mention it couldn't betray or kill its master either. So even if this Demonic Beast's cultivation base was ten times or dozens of times higher than hers, it still wouldn't be able to break the contract and harm her.\u201cThink about it yourself. I don't like to force things.\u201d Seeing the little beast on the table close its eyes and ignore her, Lou Mu Yan didn't care either. After she finished speaking, she turned and left the room.This kind of arrogant guy should be given some time to chill and let it comprehend its current situation and disadvantages. Then they would naturally be able to communicate later.The door closed securely, and the Spirit Devourer opened its eyes that were filled with complex emotions. The colour of the red fur that appeared like a flame on his forehead grew even more vivid.After that particular battle, when he was seriously injured and was about to perish, he performed the innate talent that only a Spirit Devourer King3\u00a0knew, the Reincarnation Skill. Eventually, he sealed his Beast Soul within a Crystal Core and performed a nirvana reincarnation. But he didn't think that after he was born from the reincarnated egg, he would fall into this small interface.The forceful contract that the Sword Monarch attempted to use on him activated the Seal on his Crystal Core and woke him early. Although he hadn't yet awoken during the auction, but he was aware of everything that happened.In retrospect, that woman's act of blocking the sword for him made him admire her courage.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksEven if it was impossible for him to die in the hands of that Sword Monarch, he was still touched by that woman's actions, so when he launched his Mental Energy attack, he didn't intend to kill her, but merely wanted to test her strength. The result astounded him\u2014with such powerful Mental Energy, that woman must have a lot of secrets too.A partner? Maybe he could try.A day later, Lou Mu Yan, who was sitting in the Lou Clan's practice room with her eyes closed, cultivating, suddenly opened her eyes and cast her gaze to the southeast direction outside the window.She felt Spiritual Force pouring into a particular spot\u2014it was Lou Mu Bai's room. It appeared that her eldest brother was about to advance.In a flash, Lou Mu Yan left her room and used Flash Steps to move towards the courtyard where Lou Mu Bai resided.There, the Spiritual Force of Heaven and earth in their air poured towards one are within the courtyard. She revealed a clear and attractive smile on her beautiful little face. Her eldest brother's talent was indeed exceptional\u2014he was comparable to her back in the Immortal Cultivation World with the Heavenly Spiritual Root.The cultivators in this world didn't have Spiritual Roots, but when her Soul and this body merged into one, she discovered that the strong comprehension abilities of her Heavenly Spiritual Root were also integrated. After merging, she could absorb Spiritual Force several times faster than ordinary Sword Masters, and she had the advantage when comprehending laws. Most importantly, she could also comprehend all the elemental attributes of this world.The Spiritual Force hovered in the sky above the roof, forming clusters of Spirit Clouds. Then the Spirit Clouds were pulled into the room one after another, and the person sitting inside absorbed the Spiritual Force from the Spirit Clouds to their heart's content.Not long later, Lou Zhan Tian, Lou Mo Yu and Lou Mu Ting also arrived here from different directions. When they saw Lou Mu Yan who was already standing in the courtyard, their face revealed expressions of excitement.All three of them had already finished absorbing the medicinal properties of the Marrow Cleansing Pill, and successfully cleansed their marrow and broadened their meridians.\u201cGrandpa, father, second brother, how are the effects after you finished absorbing the Marrow Cleansing Pill?\u201d Lou Mu Yan asked the three with a smile, her eyes overflowing with warmth.\u201cHAHA\u2026! Although I'm old now, but I still have successfully expanded my meridians by one third. I have hope of breaking through to a Sword Monarch within two years.\u201d Lou Zhan Tian laughed, \u201cMy family's Yan'er is the lucky star of the Lou Clan.\u201d\u201cI doubled the size of my meridians, and my absorption speed of Spiritual Force also doubled. I felt that the bottleneck that I couldn't break through before had loosened. I believe that I'll be able to successfully breakthrough to Sword Monarch soon.\u201d Lou Mo Yu said with a gentle smile with his eyes dyed in a layer of confidence.Lou Mu Ting appeared even more excited and said enthusiastically, \u201cI'm the same as Yan'er, also more than doubling the size of my meridians. I believe I'll soon be able to breakthrough to Advanced-Phase Sword Spirit.\u201dLou Mu Yan chuckled with an ease of mind. The Lou Family's talents were indeed extremely outstanding. If the Marrow Cleansing Pill was taken by a Sword Master with average talent, then it wouldn't have such a good effect.The Spiritual Force surrounding them suddenly stopped surging, and the Spirit Clouds were slowly being absorbed by the person within the room until there were none. None of them spoke as they stared, transfixed, in that direction\u2014Lou Mu Bai had reached the pivotal point of breakthrough.But what people didn't expect was that after a stick of incense of time, Spiritual Force from all directions began to surge and gather above the room's roof again, tumbling incessantly, forming clusters of Spirit Clouds, beginning another round of frenzied absorption by the person within the room.About two hours later, the Spirit Clouds in the sky dispersed and a powerful aura released from within the courtyard. Lou Mu Yan's eyes brightened, \u201cEldest brother succeeded in breaking through to Sword King.\u201d\u201cEldest brother is so abnormal.\u201d Lou Mu Ting pouted, unreconciled, but the joy in his eyes revealed that he was also exceptionally happy and excited.\u201cHAHA\u2026!\u201d Her grandfather also laughed aloud, then said: \u201cMy Lou Clan has gained another Sword King expert today.\u201dLou Mo Yu's handsome and elegant face also revealed gratification. Lou Mu Bai's advancement brought their Lou Clan's overall strength to another level.1a poem by an unknown Ming Dynasty poet that's used to describe a person, who loses their position and status etc., are even less than those who used to be their inferiors/weaker ones.2'dig a hole for someone to jump into means to prepare a trap. In this case, her trap is to make the Spirit Devourer remain contracted to her willingly by giving him better conditions.3the author used \u541e\u566c\u517dinstead of \u566c\u7075\u517d. This wasn't the first time, it happened once before, but that time I was certain it was a typo. But this time, it's possible it's a hint at the beast's real identity that's slightly different to a 'Spirit Devourer'? They're very similar translations, since both mean 'devourer'. I'll fix it in the future depending on which one the author uses and whether she gives us a more definitive explanation of this beast.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He stood in the air, standing in the direction of the General's Mansion.\u201cWhat a strong energy fluctuation during advancement.\u201d He narrowed his eyes, then laughed: \u201cThe Lou Clan has birthed another Sword King. Not bad, not bad.\u201dIn the main hall of the Imperial Palace, a middle-aged man in purple clothes walked out of the main hall, felt the Spiritual Force surge in the direction of the General's Mansion, then touched his Buddhist beads in his hands, \u201cThe Lou Clan has birthed another Sword King. Lou Mu Bai is indeed exceptionally talented.\u201dIn the Imperial Capital, a green-clothed old man expressed surprise within a hillside wooden house that sat in an area with plentiful Spiritual Force where birds sang and fragrant flowers bloomed1, \u201cSuch a powerful and grand advancement. Lou Clan's little boy truly is worthy of being the number one prodigy of the Empire!\u201dIn a courtyard of a distinguished clan, there were three people currently chatting in their seats, when suddenly they felt the Spiritual Force incessantly surge in one direction. They immediately stood up and stared, transfixed, in the direction of the Lou Clan.After the Spirit Clouds in the sky scattered, one of the middle-aged men said: \u201cThe new Sword King of the Lou Family, it must be Lou Mu Bai.\u201d\u201cDidn't he just advance to an Advanced-Phase Sword Spirit not long ago? How did he advance to the Sword King Stage so fast?\u201d A young man asked with a complicated expression.\u201cMarrow Cleansing Pill. I guess he must have obtained the Marrow Cleansing Pill.\u201d A light shone from the eyes of a man not yet twenty years of age behind the two men.\u201cYes. Yun Lan and Yun Jin both received a Marrow Cleansing Pill from Lou Mu Yan. How could Lou Mu Bai, who's Lou Mu Yan's eldest brother, not have it.\u201d The man who spoke before clenched his fist with a face of certainty. Then he turned to the middle-aged man with excitement in his eyes, \u201cFather, the effect of the Marrow Cleansing Pill seems to be even better than what the rumours said.\u201d\u201cMarrow Cleansing Pill.\u201d The middle-aged man murmured, then laughed aloud, \u201cLet's go visit the Lou Clan now to congratulate Lou Mu Bai's advancement.\u201dAn old woman sat cross-legged atop a deep pond. She retracted her gaze that fell on the sky, then immediately received a message from her family.\u201cMarrow Cleansing Pill?\u201d The old woman stood up from atop the deep pond and walked on its surface towards the shore step by step. \u201cFor the clan, it looks like I must personally visit the Lou Clan.\u201dSimilar scenes occurred across Yan'zhou Country. Lou Mu Bai's advancement, accompanied with the previous situation on the Marrow Cleansing Pill, once again caused a sensation in the entire Imperial Capital.The General's Mansion in the Imperial Capital.A gentle, handsome, white-clothed man walked out of the room in the courtyard. He was tall and slender with an ethereal, otherworldly temperament. His entire person naturally exuded a feeling of a fallen immortal.\u201cGrandpa, father, Yan'er, Xiao Ting.\u201d Lou Mu Bai's eyes were dyed with joy. Even he didn't think that he could borrow the broadened meridians from consuming the Marrow Cleansing Pill to madly absorb Spiritual Force and unexpectedly advance to a Sword King.\u201cCongratulations eldest brother on becoming a Sword King expert.\u201d Lou Mu Yan naturally hugged Lou Mu Bai's arm, blinked her eyes, and said with a smile.Lou Mu Bai reached out a hand and poked Lou Mu Yan's small, pretty nose, \u201cThis time, it was all thanks to Yan'er's pill.\u201d\u201cEldest brother, aren't you a little too abnormal. It's only been a few years and you left me behind so far already.\u201d Lou Mu Ting raised his eyebrow and huffed, but within, he was proud of having such an elder brother.Lou Mu Bai glanced at him and said: \u201cWell who told you to run around everywhere day and night and not focus on cultivating. The fact that you can even reach Middle-Phase Sword Spirit was because of your talent.\u201dHe glanced at his sister who smiled like a flower, then looked back at his younger brother with a smile, yet not quite a smile, and added another stab: \u201cIf you stay this idle, I believe that Yan'er will surpass you soon.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksLou Mu Ting rolled his eyes, \u201cAs if I'll be surpassed by this little girl.\u201d\u201cSecond brother, then let's compete to see who can advance to Sword King first.\u201d Lou Mu Yan really liked this homely feeling and atmosphere. She smiled and looked at Lou Mu Ting in provocation.\u201cSure, let's compete then. When you lose, don't cry.\u201dLou Mu Yan rolled her eyes at Lou Mu Ting\u2014 she hadn't cried since embarking on the journey of cultivation.With her natural endowments and experience, it was exceptionally easy to surpass Lou Mu Ting. \u201cWho knows who'll be the one crying then. Let's wait and see.\u201dThe two played and laughed around, then Lou Mu Yan told them what occurred at the auction yesterday.Grandfather and the rest all agreed with her approach. Instead of hiding things and being coveted by others, they might as well make it public. Since everyone knew it, then the secret would no longer be a secret.What made grandfather and Lou Mo Yu relieved was that Lou Mu Yan really grew up, was sensible, and knew how to be considerate.The fact that Lou Mu Yan could gift the Marrow Cleaning Pill to Yun Lan proved that she put her aunt in the palace, who loved her, in her heart. It showed that her family still held a significant place in her heart.\u201cAlthough not many people dared to scheme against the Lou Clan, but Yan'er still needs to be more careful in the future to prevent vile people from causing trouble.\u201d Lou Mo Yu still had some concern about the safety of his daughter, \u201cHow about during this time, you can cultivate by Mu Bai's side.\u201d\u201cDaddy, I can't always keep growing beneath your wings, I won't go far that way.\u201d Lou Mu Yan's heart warmed as she radiated self-confidence, making her appear beautiful and refined.She looked at them with determination in her eyes: \u201cI will continue to work hard towards the path of the strong. Even if before me is a path full of thorns, I'll still charge forward and create my own path towards strength.\u201dUpon hearing what sounded like an oath of her determination and resoluteness, they were stunned.\u201cAlright! As expected of my Lou Clan's child. This firm heart of a cultivator is the most precious.\u201d Grandfather's eyes revealed gratification and admiration\u2014he would be the first to support his family's Yan'er's grand aspirations.After a pause, grandfather added: \u201cYan'er is right. Sword Cultivation is essentially Heaven-defying, so one cannot cultivate with fear. It takes a firm heart of Dao to become a strong person. This situation could be considered Yan'er's test, let's let her do what she wants.\u201d\u201cThank you grandpa!\u201d Lou Mu Yan let go of Lou Mu Bai and affectionately shook her grandfather's arm. Even she, herself, didn't expect to behave like this one day, so natural and genuine.\u201cI thought incorrectly, Yan'er's choice is right.\u201d His daughter's words made Lou Mo Yu see through the murkiness of his mind. Previously, he and his wife were too afraid of their daughter getting hurt, so they protected her too well. But clearly the effect wasn't good.Now that his daughter radiated self-confidence, it also became his drive. He decided to comply with his daughter's wishes and let her grow independently. He believed that his daughter wouldn't let him down.\u201cYan'er is so confident, we must work harder too.\u201d Lou Mu Bai's eyes were filled with determination and hope. He would also move forward courageously on the path of the strong.Lou Mu Ting was also touched by his big brother and little sister's determination and resoluteness. He couldn't be left too far behind by them either. After returning to the frontier, he should also concentrate and devote his energy to cultivation.The family happily talked about their experience in cultivation, and although Lou Mu Yan's cultivation base was the lowest, but the opinions she raised from time to time caused them to reflect. Upon the end of their discussion, they quickly returned to their respective rooms and attempted to comprehend aided by the realisations from her words.That day, many people came to visit the Lou Clan under the pretence of congratulating Lou Mu Bai on his advancement, but they were all sent away by the steward with the excuse that their Eldest Young Master was still consolidating his cultivation base.Early the next morning, an imperial edict summoned Lou Mu Yan and Lou Mu Bai to the palace, breaking the peace in the Lou Clan.Lou Mu Yan held the imperial edict in her hands with an understanding in her heart. The Imperial Family definitely wanted to know the origins of the Marrow Cleansing Pill or wanted to enquire about the Alchemist who refined the Marrow Cleansing Pill from her. But she had already prepared for this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Only once they've arrived did they get out of the carriage and walk into the large hall.On the main seat in the middle of the large hall sat a handsome middle-aged man in bright yellow brocade. With one look, one could tell his identity. On the lower right side sat a radiant and glamorous woman in a red palace dress\u2014she was precisely Lou Mu Yan's aunt, Lou Mo Zi.In addition to the two and the palace guards in the hall, there also sat two elderly men with an extraordinary temperament, and who appeared lively and vigorous.\u201cFormal greetings to the Emperor, Empress.\u201d Lou Mu Bai lead Lou Mu Yan into the hall and raised his hands to respectfully greet the two on the main seats.Then he turned around and greeted the two elderly men respectfully, \u201cLou Mu Bai greets Imperial Teacher, Principal.\u201dWhen a Sword Master greeted the Emperor, there was no need to bow down like a commoner or ordinary person.Lou Mu Yan also took a step forward and greeted the several people respectfully, imitating Lou Mu Bai.\u201cIt seems that the rumours are true. The little girl Mu Yan has indeed changed a lot.\u201d Emperor Yun Tian Chen said with a gentle smile to the Empress beside him.Empress Lou Mo Zi glared at Yun Tian Chen, then with a smile: \u201cHowever Yan'er changes, she is still our Lou Clan's treasure.\u201d The implication in her words was to remind Lou Mu Yan that she had a special identity and needn't tolerate others' bullying.Yun Tian Chen revealed a little helplessness in his eyes\u2014Mo Zi was more and more distrustful of him. Did she think he'd eat Lou Mu Yan1?\u201cYan'er, come here.\u201d Lou Mo Zi beckoned gently to Lou Mu Yan, her eyes looking at her dotingly.Lou Mu Yan was naturally able to tell her aunt really loved her, and her heart felt warm. She took a few steps forward, held Lou Mo Zi's hand and addressed intimately: \u201cAunt!\u201d\u201cAs long as you, little girl, is fine, then everything's well. When you were injured by that Gu Yan Ran before, it truly worried aunt.\u201d Lou Mo Zi said with a coldness in her eyes. This debt would definitely be repaid by the Gu Clan.Lou Mu Yan patted Lou Mo Zi's hand lightly to show comfort and said nonchalantly: \u201cIt's just an insignificant person, don't let it affect aunt's mood.\u201dThere really wasn't any need to pay attention to a person like Gu Yan Ran. But of course, the 'repayment' towards Gu Yan Ran wouldn't be lacking either.Seeing that the two involved the Gu Clan now, Yun Tian Chen displayed a somewhat unnatural expression, then changed the subject with a smile, \u201cLittle girl, I heard that your Terminal Meridians constitution has been eradicated?\u201d\u201cReplying to the Emperor, yes.\u201d Lou Mu Yan replied with a faint smile, but the smile didn't reach her eyes.\u201cHow could you call the Empress 'aunt', yet call zhen2\u00a0Emperor?\u201d Yun Tian Chen's eyes revealed a trace of affection, \u201cYou used to call zhen uncle.\u201d\u201cThat was because Mu Yan was ignorant before, but now I don't dare to be presumptuous anymore to save my aunt from experiencing any grievance in the palace.\u201d Lou Mu Yan's face remained unchanged, but her tone carried a little sarcasm.Her aunt had given so much to this man, but this man kept accepting one concubine after the other. In recent years, he had even been pampering Gu Yan Ran's elder sister extensively. She didn't want to care about whether the structure of the Empire required him to do this or not\u2014she only complained for her Aunt that doted on her.Yun Tian Chen's eyes darkened\u2014this girl was even bolder now. He turned his head to look at the emotionless Empress, feeling bitter in his heart. He sighed secretly. He also had his own difficulties, made too many involuntary decisions, but he also let down his most beloved woman.\u201cYou little girl.\u201d Yun Tian Chen's face revealed a helpless smile, pretending not to understand her insinuations. As Lou Mo Zi loved Lou Mu Yan, then he, too, would adore Lou Mu Yan. If he blamed Lou Mu Yan right now for her words, then he was afraid that his relationship with Lou Mo Zi would be even stiffer.A sliver of sorrow flashed across Lou Mo Zi's eyes, but not wanting to mention Imperial Noble Consort Gu, she lifted her head and smiled at Lou Mu Bai, \u201cMu Bai, congratulations!\u201d\u201cThank you, aunt!\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cMu Bai, do you have any plans after advancing now?\u201d Yun Tian Chen valued Lou Mu Bai. As the number one prodigy of the Empire, he would definitely be great support in the future to Yan'zhou Country.Lou Mu Bai's gentle, handsome face, was still calm and composed, \u201cReplying to the Emperor, I want to continue to stay at the Imperial Academy and participate in the Academy's annual competition, then the Trials after that.\u201d\u201cSounds fine.\u201d Yun Tian Chen nodded.The Imperial Academy's annual competition was exceptionally important this time. After the annual competition was the selection Trials. With Lou Mu Bai participating, the safety of the students had more guarantee.Then, Yun Tian Chen chatted idly with Lou Mu Bai and Lou Mu Yan, all of which were rather simple questions.Seeing that the topic between the Emperor and the two simply wasn't entering into the main subject, the white-haired old man in the main hall coughed gently. Then he looked at Lou Mu Yan and asked straightforwardly: \u201cLou girl, do you still have anymore Marrow Cleansing Pills that you gifted to Yun Lan and Yun Jin?\u201d\u201cNo more.\u201d Lou Mu Yan opened her palms and shrugged.The two old men in front of them were both Sword Monarch experts, and were important figures within Yan'zhou Country. The white-haired elderly man that spoke to her was Yan'zhou Empire's Imperial Teacher, Yun Cang, and the green-clothed elderly man who wore a smile beside him was the Imperial Academy's Principal, Ruan Li. As such, she maintained the respect that they deserved in her attitude towards them.\u201cThen can you tell us how you obtained the Marrow Cleansing Pill?\u201d Yun Cang didn't conceal the expectant look in his eyes. The Marrow Cleansing Pill's effects were simply too amazing, so they must ask clearly.\u201cMy Master gave it to me.\u201d Lou Mu Yan didn't even blink when lying.Yun Cang frowned and asked in surprise: \u201cMaster? Why have I never heard of you having a Master before?\u201d\u201cI only became Master's disciple when I went to the Blazing Mountain Range, that's why no one knows.\u201d\u201cIs your Master in the Imperial Capital?\u201d Yun Cang couldn't help but show excitement. They all thought that there was an expert behind Lou Mu Yan, so the purpose of calling Lou Mu Yan here was to befriend that high-level Alchemist through her.The Marrow Cleansing Pill was simply too important for Yan'zhou Country. If they could get their hands on a few, then they would definitely be able to raise more Sword Kings with better aptitudes, and perhaps even Sword Monarchs. By then, entering the ranks of a powerful country was only a matter of time. With such an opportunity in front of them, how could they not be tempted by it and take a shot at it.Yun Tian Chen and Ruan Li also looked at Lou Mu Yan nervously. They weren't doing it for themselves\u2014everything was for the glory of the Empire.Lou Mu Yan shook her head: \u201cAfter Master gifted me the pill, he went to travel. As for when he'll be back, I also don't know.\u201d\u201cIs your Master an Alchemist? Why did you become his disciple?\u201d A trace of disappointment flashed through Yun Cang's eyes, but he still looked at Lou Mu Yan, unreconciled, and continued asking.\u201cI heard that there's a kind of Spiritual Herb in the Blazing Mountain Range that could improve one's constitution, so I went the Blazing Mountain Range with a Mercenary Party, who took on a mission in there, thinking to at least give it a try. Then we were separated by a group of Fur Crimson Boars, and I accidentally strayed into an underground cave and met Master.\u201d Amongst the commoners, there were indeed rumours of this sort of Spiritual Herb, but no one had ever obtained such a Spiritual Herb. But Lou Mu Yan could still borrow this to conceal the fact that she went to the Blazing Mountain Range to look for the Flame Fruit.\u201cAt the time, he just finished absorbing and refining the Crystal Core of a Demonic Beast. When he saw me break in, he initially wanted to kill me. But who knew that he discovered I had Elemental Energy with wood and fire attributes, said that I had the talent for Alchemy, then inexplicably told me to become his disciple.\u201dThe reason why Alchemists were scarce on this land was because one must have comprehended both the wood attribute element and the fire attribute element to become an Alchemist. The dual Elemental Energy attribute talent was vital.\u201cBecause of my Terminal Meridians constitution, I couldn't absorb the Spiritual Force of Heaven and earth to use my wood and fire attribute Elemental Energy, so Master threw me a bottle of Marrow Cleansing Pills to refine, and eradicate and improve my constitution. He also taught me some alchemy skills, then send me to the peripheral of the Blazing Mountain Range and left.\u201dLou Mu Yan slowly said the excuse she had thought of previously. Regardless of whether they believed her or not, if they couldn't find the Master she spoke of, then they couldn't do anything about her either.1the 'eat' in this context means to bully, burden, and/or cause suffering to.2hmmmm, tried to use the royal 'We' here but then I think it won't be too confusing if I just use the pin'yin 'zhen'. Which is said only by the Emperor in replacement of the less formal 'I'.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He believed the expert that Lou Mu Yan spoke of existed, after all, the Lou Clan didn't have an Alchemist, so it was impossible for them to refine the Marrow Cleansing Pill.It was just that they didn't know whether the expert was in the Imperial Capital or not, nor whether Lou Mu Yan had more Marrow Cleansing Pills on her or not. He had doubts in his heart, but he couldn't express it directly, so he cast a surreptitious glance to Ruan Li.Ruan Li pondered for a moment, then smiled softly and said: \u201cSo, according to what you said, Lou girl can concoct pills? I heard that you even won a cauldron at the auction. Could it be for your own use?\u201d\u201cWhen I was in the cave, Master personally guided me for a few days. I can now refine Grade 1 pills.\u201d When one should be humble, then they should keep a low profile, but when it was suitable to shine, then one needn't conceal.Only by exposing one's own advantages could they be qualified to negotiate the terms.\u201cWhat?\u201d Ruan Li couldn't help but stand with disbelief written on his face.Yun Tian Chen and Yun Cang both displayed shock and doubt. Lou Mu Yan was now a Grade 1 Alchemist? How could that be possible. Alchemists weren't like cabbages. She only cultivated for how long and she could already refine a Grade 1 pill? They doubted deeply.\u201cDon't believe me?\u201d Lou Mu Yan raised her eyebrow, took out the cyan1\u00a0cauldron from her interspatial ring and asked: \u201cWould you like me to show it to you?\u201d\u201cBelieve!\u201d Ruan Li suppressed the suspicion in his eyes and put on an amicable smile, \u201cBut of course, it would be even better if Lou girl could refine a batch of Grade 1 pills in front of us.\u201dAlchemists on Tian'ling Continent were simply too scarce, and the Alchemists of Yan'zhou Country were even scarcer, with not more than ten. If Lou Mu Yan truly was a Grade 1 Alchemist, then it was definitely worth their efforts to raise her.\u201cLittle girl, if you really have this ability, then go ahead and show it. It would be of great benefit to you and even your Lou Clan.\u201d Yun Tian Chen concealed his excitement. If Lou Mu Yan was really an Alchemist, then it would be great for Yan'zhou Country.Lou Mu Yan nodded, walked to a table, and placed the cauldron atop of it. Then she took out the Spiritual Herbs required for the pill she planned to refine one by one.Without a Pill Flame, she could only use charcoal fire to light up and control it to the temperature required for refining pills. Then she threw a dark green Spiritual Herb into the cauldron.She used her Mental Energy to refine the Spiritual Herb into a dark green liquid, purified it, poured the purified powder into a white porcelain bowl, then threw in the second Spiritual Herb to continue.The reason why Lou Mu Yan took out the purified powders one by one, then throw them into the cauldron to mix when it was time to condense the pills was so that she wouldn't expose her Mental Energy.Time passed bit by bit, and the people watched as her slender, white hands threw, took, and placed, with a serious and confident attitude. Every movement was like a painting, pleasing to the eye.[WENG!]Hearing a light buzzing sound from the cauldron, Lou Mu Yan smacked the cauldron with her palm, then a pill fragrance wafted out from within. A few pills flew out and landed in her hands.\u201cThis is a Grade 1 Energy Nourishing Pill, and it has the miraculous effects of treating internal and external injuries.\u201d Lou Mu Yan filled a white porcelain bottle with the pills and handed it to Ruan Li.Ruan Li's eyes revealed a sliver of sharpness. He took the pill, poured one out and smelled it, only to be stunned and couldn't help but exclaim: \u201cThis is a Top-Quality pill, not to mention you could refine five in one batch. Even a Grade 2 Alchemist couldn't necessarily produce such a high-quality pill, not to mention such a high pill rate.\u201d\u201cExcellent! Lou girl is truly exceptionally talented in Alchemy.\u201d Yun Cang also didn't expect this result, so he patted the armrest of the chair excitedly.Just then, he was already stunned at just how fluid her movements were, like flowing water, yet who knew that the quality of the pills and the pill rate would be so high as well.With such talents in Alchemy, it was definitely possible for her to advance to a Grade 3 Alchemist. No wonder that mysterious expert Alchemist would value her at a glance\u2014he was truly wise to be able to recognise a pearl2.There was a faint smile in Lou Mu Bai's indifferent eyes. His younger sister did a good job. She used her actions to convince the others to believe the existence of the mysterious high-level Alchemist, and she also put herself, along with the Lou Clan, in the most advantageous position.\u201cYou just said that the Energy Nourishing Pill has the miraculous effect of treating internal and external injuries?\u201d Yun Tian Chen fell silent for a moment before staring at Lou Mu Yan, unable to conceal the delight and burning desire in his eyes.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cYes!\u201d Lou Mu Yan had to admit that maybe Yun Tian Chen wasn't a good husband, but he was a good Emperor. What he now thought of was definitely using the Energy Nourishing Pill in the army.The Tian'ling Continent not only lacked Alchemists, but pill recipes were also scarce. Even a Grade 1 recipe would be vied for by numerous entities. The Energy Nourishing Pill had never appeared on this land, so it was even more precious.\u201cLou girl, can you sell these pills to us?\u201d Yun Tian Chen wanted to test the Energy Nourishing Pills for its effects.Lou Mu Yan played with the porcelain bottle she had taken back from Ruan Li, pondered for a bit, before raising her head and said: \u201cSure! But I don't want money. I want Spiritual Herbs in exchange.\u201d\u201cThat's not a problem. You can write down the Spiritual Herbs you want. As long as the Imperial Treasury has it, we can give it to you.\u201d Yun Tian Chen agreed with a smile. Being so generous naturally also meant he wanted to win her over.Lou Mu Yan also wasn't humble. She took out a piece of paper and brush from her interspatial ring and began to write the list on the table. Then she handed an entire page full of Spiritual Herbs to Yun Tian Chen, and amongst them were also the Spiritual Herbs required to refine the Foundation Establishment Pill.Yun Tian Chen took the paper and glanced over it casually, then his face changed. The corners of his lips couldn't help but twitch. Not only did she want so many kinds of Spiritual Herbs, but there were even some high-level Spiritual Herbs scattered within that even the Imperial Treasury didn't have. Was she trying to rip off some foolish spendthrift3?He couldn't help but hand the paper over to the Imperial Teacher. Whether or not to give Lou Mu Yan these Spiritual Herbs also required the Imperial Teacher's input.Seeing the Emperor's helpless look, Yun Cang took a look, and his expression also changed in an instant, then handed the paper to Ruan Li with a frown.Ruan Li took a look at the paper curiously and couldn't help but smile. This girl was a master who wouldn't suffer. In what way was this a deal, this was simply an extortion.But what could he do when Lou Mu Yan was a student of his Imperial Academy? He, Ruan Li, was very protective, so his heart must lean towards his students.\u201cThis is only a little bit of Spiritual Herbs. Your Imperial Family's large and prosperous, this little bit of Spiritual Herbs is just a single fur from nine oxen2. Based on my opinion, you aren't at a disadvantage in this transaction.\u201dYun Cang was originally a very rigorous and strict person, but right now he couldn't help but glare at Ruan Li. This old thing had nothing to do with this, that's the only reason he could speak so casually.Lou Mu Yan didn't expect that Ruan Li would stand on her side, but understood when she thought of Ruan Li's identity. A smile rose on her lips\u2014this old man wasn't that bad.If one wasn't prepared to risk their child, they would never catch the wolf4. So after a short moment, Yun Cang nodded to Yun Tian Chen.\u201cLou girl, we have two-thirds of the Spiritual Herbs on this list in the Imperial Treasury, but the rest might not even be found in the hands of a Sword Monarch in the Empire, let along the Imperial Treasury.\u201cWhich ones?\u201d Lou Mu Yan already had a guess in her heart.\u201cDeep Orchid, Seven-Leaf Ginseng, Holly Grass\u2026\u201d Yun Tian Chen read out the nine types of Spiritual Herbs that they really didn't have in the Treasury.Although Lou Mu Yan was a little disappointed, but it was already a huge profit to exchange more than thirty precious Spiritual Herbs.She threw the bottle in her hand to Yun Tian Chen and said straightforwardly, \u201cForget it. I'll suffer the loss. Other than these nine kinds of Spiritual Herbs, give me two of everything else.\u201dYun Tian Chen and Yun Cang almost couldn't help but spit out a mouthful of blood5\u2014did she suffer a loss? And two of each? Did she even want any face\u20261I had trouble translating the colour \u9752 (qing) for a while. I translated it as blue, then I edited it to green\u2026 but why did I never think of cyan? I don't know why it took me so long to figure out how to translate it when it was that simple \u2013 it's a mix between blue and green so it's cyan, duh!2recognise an amazing person3a colloquial saying often used between friends, usually to describe a person, or rhetorically describe themselves.

She's just a jester.\u201dShe had never highly regarded Gu Yan Ting. From the very beginning, all she cared about was Yun Tian Chen's attitude. But the results made her disappointed time and again.Lou Mu Yan caught the sadness in her aunt's eyes, but she was also extremely powerless. Strength could be improved, one could fight in an attempt to obtain what one couldn't, but feelings really weren't something that allowed other people to meddle with.\u201cDoes aunt want to improve your strength?\u201d Lou Mu Yan pondered a little\u2014maybe doing other things to pass the time could make her aunt a bit happier.Lou Mo Zi's heart warmed, and a charming smile bloomed on her gorgeous face: \u201cI'm already past the age of rushing about to cultivate. I'm really not keen on the matters of cultivation.\u201dShe also knew Lou Mu Yan's thoughts, but she really didn't have much talent on the path of cultivation, and had stayed at Advanced-Phase Great Sword Master for many years already. Although advancing to the Sword Spirit Stage was only a matter of time for her, but if she wanted to advance to a Sword King, it was almost impossible.\u201cThen what does aunt like? Alchemy? Smithing? Talismans? Or maybe Arrays?\u201d Lou Mu Yan also heard that her aunt hadn't been keen on cultivation since she was a child, and these things couldn't be forced, so she made a few other suggestions. Having things to do was always better.\u201cAlchemy, Smithing and Talisman making all required talent, and I don't have any of that.\u201d Lou Mo Zi smiled and shook her head, but when she mentioned the last item, there was a sense of regret in her voice: \u201cI've studied the basics of Arrays, but it's just that there are too few ancient records, so even if I wanted to continue researching, I don't really have a choice.\u201dShe wasn't keen on cultivation since she was a child, but she liked to study on the Path of the Arrays, but it was a pity that in the end it she was unskilled at it.As she thought more and more, Lou Mo Zi's eyes darkened. Now that her niece mentioned it, she realised that she had really wasted her time on unnecessary conflicts over the years.Maybe Yan'er was right. She should find something she liked to do. Her heart couldn't keep revolving around Yun Tian Chen\u2014she was really tired.\u201cIf aunt likes Arrays, then that's easy. I just read some ancient records regarding Arrays, and I still remember them. I'll write it down when I return home and send it to you.\u201dUpon seeing Lou Mu Yan's black eyes shining as bright as stars, Lou Mo Zi's heart melted in a complete mess. She smiled and nodded, \u201cSure!\u201dAfter the two talked for a little while, they saw a beautiful woman in a pink dress walk towards them with several maidservants.Lou Mo Zi's eyes grew cold, turned her head to Lou Mu Yan and said: \u201cLater, if she provokes us, you don't have to be considerate. Aunt will take care of things if anything happens.\u201dShe couldn't bear Lou Mu Yan receiving any grievances and didn't want the niece she pampered like her own daughter to change her personality because of her. So what if she was arrogant and tyrannical? As long as Yan'er was happy.\u201cSure!\u201d Lou Mu Yan naturally took the Empress's hand and walked forward together.Gu Yan Ting was indeed a beauty. Different from her aunt's glamour and magnanimity, she bore a kind of delicate and demure beauty that men preferred more.In her memory, every time Gu Yan Ting saw Lou Mu Yan in the past, she would ridicule and provoke, specifically targeting her wounds. Her aunt also had a maidservant slap Gu Yan Ting's face because of this. In the end, the issue was taken to the Emperor, and because of this, the Emperor and Empress's feelings also grew colder.All in all, when Lou Mu Yan 'exchanged moves'1\u00a0with the Gu Clan's sisters she was always defeated. The two constantly faked being weak and aloof, but Gu Yan Ting's methods were more skilful.\u201cThis servant consort greets Empress.\u201d Once they were face-to-face, Gu Yan Ting stepped out first and greeted Lou Mo Zi respectfully, her voice soft and gentle.Lou Mu Yan furrowed her brows\u2014she hated this sort of women that simply wasn't gentle act delicate or demure. Especially the deliberate soft and sugary voice that made her very disgusted.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cStand.\u201d The smile on Lou Mo Zi's face had long disappeared, and she nodded coldly.Gu Yan Ting stood and looked at Lou Mu Yan with a smile, greeting: \u201cYoung Miss Lou.\u201dLou Mu Yan didn't perform a formal greeting towards Imperial Noble Consort Gu, and her voice was indifferent, \u201cImperial Noble Consort Gu.\u201dGu Yan Ting was surprised. Today, these two people gave her a different feeling from the usual.\u201cYoung Miss Lou didn't go see Sir Chi today? I heard from Yan Ran that he was accidentally injured while cultivating.\u201d Gu Yan Ting looked at Lou Mu Yan with a smile. The meaning behind her words were obvious\u2014the first person to go accompany Chi Yi Xuan when he was injured was her younger sister.\u201cIt's not like I'm the concubine the Chi Clan set, what does Chi Yi Xuan being injured or not have to do with me? Why should I go visit him?\u201d Lou Mu Yan looked at Gu Yan Ting with a smile that wasn't quite a smile.Gu Yan Ting's expressions stiffened. She didn't expect that Lou Mu Yan, who would immediately change the moment Chi Yi Xuan was spoken of, could be so indifferent today. Now that she mentioned her younger sister being a concubine, anger rose.Humph, since I can't provoke Lou Mu Yan today, it's still good to provoke the Empress.\u201cElder sister2, are you going to enjoy the flowers in the Southern Park with Young Miss Lou?\u201d Gu Yan Ting covered half her face with a fan and pretended to be shy, \u201cThis servant consort commented on how the peonies in the Southern Park were blooming so beautifully a couple of days ago, and then Emperor ordered people to move the peonies in the Southern Park to this servant consort's courtyard. Now there are no flowers in the Southern Park to view, so elder sister does not need to go for nothing.\u201dLou Mu Yan sneered at such direct flaunting, then turned her head and asked Lou Mo Zi: \u201cAunt, since when did you have a younger sister, why don't I know?\u201d\u201cImperial Noble Consort Gu, this Empress3\u00a0only has an elder brother and a younger brother, but no younger sisters. It's best that you do not randomly seek connections.\u201d Lou Mo Zi continued on from Lou Mu Yan's words, but today she really wasn't in the mood to deal with Gu Yan Ting in front of her niece, \u201cThis Empress still has something to do, you may withdraw now.\u201dGu Yan Ting's face changed, her white teeth bit her pink lips and suppressed the secret hatred in her heart. Lou Mo Zi wouldn't be complacent for long now, so she could bear her for the time being.She just didn't believe that, after hearing that the Emperor dug up the peonies that Lou Mo Zi personally planted, this woman wouldn't feel unhappy.\u201cYes. This servant consort withdraws.\u201d There was a hint of complacency in her voice.After Gu Yan Ting finished speaking, she took the maidservants past Lou Mu Yan and Lou Mo Zi, leaving the back garden in lotus-like steps4.But the moment they passed, Lou Mu Yan smelled a very light sweet scent from Gu Yan Ting. She narrowed her eyes\u2014there was a problem with this woman.After a while, she moved her gaze away from Gu Yan Ran's back, and when she raised her eyes, she caught a very light sadness in her aunt's eyes.Lou Mo Zi appeared indifferent to the situation of the Southern Park on the surface, but she still felt extremely uncomfortable inside. Every single peony there was planted by her own hands, yet who would've thought that that man would let people dig it up and gift it to Gu Yan Ting. Was he also digging her heart5?\u201cAunt, sometimes what you see and hear is not necessarily the truth.\u201d Lou Mu Yan couldn't help but remind.Lou Mo Zi suppressed the sadness in her eyes. She didn't want to mention anything regarding that man anymore, so she changed the subject, \u201cYan'er, you entered the palace so early in the morning, you must be hungry now, right? Shall we return to my resting quarters and eat?\u201d\u201cSure!\u201d Lou Mu Yan didn't mention anymore. She only had a suspicion in her heart, so it was best to verify it with a little investigation, then speak of it.1fought with them, verbally or physically, and could involve obscure understandings of words as well as scheming.2concubines and wives etc. would also call each other as 'elder sister' or 'younger sister' etc.3techically she doesn't really use the word 'Empress', but a specific way of addressing herself, like how the Emperor addresses himself as 'zhen'.

Annoyed, Lou Mu Yan secretly returned to the Imperial Academy's small building to cultivate and arranged an Array around the courtyard.Ruan Li paid a lot of attention to Lou Mu Yan as she was an Alchemist. Knowing that she wanted to avoid those who wanted to obtain some information, he asked people to guard her courtyard and not allow any outsiders to bother her.In the small building, Lou Mu Yan naturally knew what Ruan Li did, and was happy to accept this personal favour.After taking a Spiritual Energy Enhancing Pill, she began to absorb the Spiritual Force of Heaven and earth and convert it into Spiritual Energy.The Spiritual Force was much more abundant in the Academy than in the Lou Clan, while the dan'tian in her body was like a bottomless pit, so every day she absorbed Spiritual Force madly, causing some spectacular phenomenon around the small building.For example, even though there's no advancement, there would be a dense amount of Spirit Clouds, and because she could comprehend all the elements in this world, some Spirit Clouds that formed were even of different colours: gold, cyan, red, yellow, and blue alternated.Such a spectacle also attracted the attention of the Academy's superiors and other students, but the Principal had addressed the issue early on, otherwise Lou Mu Yan's small building would've been swarmed with people who wanted to investigate.In a majestic and quaint hall within the Academy, there sat six high-ranked people of the Academy. Aside from Principal Ruan Li being a Sword Monarch expert, the other five were all Sword Kings.\u201cPrincipal, just what kind of skill is Lou Mu Yan cultivating? How can there be so many Spirit Clouds gathering every day, not to mention this situation had been going on for nearly a month.\u201d A tall and thin middle-aged man asked with knitted brows, carrying with his words a sense of inquiry into the situation.Ruan Li held a blue and white porcelain teacup with inked bamboo, brushed the top of the cup with the lid to cool the tea, and took a sip, \u201cEven I don't know.\u201d He was also very curious as to why Lou Mu Yan could attract Spirit Clouds for such a long period of time, but this was her secret, and he wouldn't look into it.\u201cHer cultivating like this has attracted the attention of other students in the Academy. During this period, students often loiter around her courtyard. I'm afraid that the longer this extends, it will negatively affect the Academy.\u201d The middle-aged man continued after pondering. He had a good relationship with the King of Zhen'xi, Yun Tian Zong, so he had the intent to suppress Lou Mu Yan.A tall, sexy and glamourous woman beside the middle-aged man curled her lips into a smile and said disapprovingly: \u201cI don't think Lou Mu Yan's behaviour would have any negative effects. The fact that she could borrow the effects of the Marrow Cleansing Pill to eradicate her Terminal Meridians constitution, break through to a Great Sword Master cultivation base, and could now even gather Spirit Clouds when cultivating, meant that her talent was very good. Our Academy should raise her vigorously.\u201dAmongst them, a woman with a cold attitude and ordinary face replied with a sense of rivalry, \u201cThe ability to attract Spirit Clouds does not equate to good talent. There are many students at the Great Sword Master cultivation base. It's too hasty to say we should raise her vigorously based on those two points.\u201dBefore the glamourous woman could reply, her expression unhappy, a rotund old man that sat across her with red hair and a red beard stroked his beard and said with a smile: \u201cI heard that Lou Clan's little girl is also a Grade 1 Alchemist. Such a good seedling can't be wasted. How about you throw her to me to teach?\u201dThe red-haired old man was named Ruan Yang and was not only Ruan Li's younger brother of the same parents, but was also the only Grade 3 Alchemist in the Yan'zhou Empire. He held a very high status and was highly respected. In terms of the power to rally supporters, it even surpassed the Principal, Ruan Li. But he was usually indifferent to fame and fortune, devoting himself to Alchemy, and rarely appeared in the Academy.This time he was only here because Ruan Li recalled him to discuss matters about the Marrow Cleansing Pill and the Energy Nourishing Pill. Of course, he, himself, was also very interested in the girl Lou Mu Yan. If the rumours were true, then such a good seedling couldn't be given up.Upon hearing Ruan Yang's words, the faces of the people present changed, except Ruan Li. The face of the ordinary-looking woman sank, while the expression of the middle-aged man who disliked Lou Mu Yan was even more obscure.The Academy's grand competition is going to be held in three days. Let's wait for after the competition to discuss this matter.\u201d Ruan Li observed the expressions of the several people and smiled softly, \u201cDon't forget the grand competition this time is related to the selection of people for the Empire's Trials. The once every twenty-year event is approaching. Tian'ling Continent's society structure will also change accordingly. Our Imperial Academy is one of the pillars of Yan'zhou Country, so I don't wish for anyone to suppress the students of this Academy simply because of their personal feelings.\u201dAfter he finished speaking, he glanced sharply at the middle-aged man. Lou Mu Yan had already been listed by him and the Imperial Family as an important person to protect and raise, so whoever dared to scheme against her needed to weigh their consequences.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksOf course, they wouldn't make a move if it didn't involve any life and death situations. If Lou Mu Yan wanted to enjoy the resources they provided, then she also needed to demonstrate strength that they could recognise.Startled, the middle-aged man's face changed, a little ugly. Ruan Li's sharp gaze made his heart tremble. It seemed that it would be impossible to deal with Lou Mu Yan in the near future.\u201cDo you think anyone in the Earth Class would stand out and become a member of the Trial?\u201d The glamorous woman from before chuckled, \u201cI have high hopes for Lou Mu Yan.\u201d\u201cWhy don't we make a bet?\u201d A handsome young man, who had been silent the entire time, spoke up with some interest in his eyes, \u201cLet's bet on whether she can win Gu Yan Ran or not, and win the single quota set for the Earth Class.\u201d\u201cSure!\u201d The glamorous woman was also interested, raised her eyebrows and said: \u201cHow should we bet? I'm going to bet Lou Mu Yan wins.\u201d\u201cWe'll take out a Spirit Treasure each and bet on whether they win or lose.\u201d The young man took out a golden treasured sword and placed it on the desk, a meaningful smile playing about his lips, \u201cI bet Lou Mu Yan wins.\u201dThe middle-aged man sneered and took out a ring-shaped attack Magic Tool, \u201cI bet that Gu Yan Ran wins.\u201d These two people were truly underestimating the Gu Clan, and underestimating Gu Yan Ran. He knew Gu Yan Ran's strength wasn't as simple as it was on the surface.\u201cI also bet Gu Yan Ran.\u201d The ordinary-looking woman took out a round bead and placed it on the table.Ruan Yang swept the Spirit Treasures on the table, and said: \u201cI don't have any extra Spirit Tools on me, can I bet pills?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d The others agreed in unison. Elder Yang's pills were much more valuable than Spirit Treasures.Seeing that three of them bet on Lou Mu Yan, Ruan Li raised his eyebrows with a smile and said: \u201cIs this interesting for you all? If Lou Mu Yan wins, how will the three of you divide the spoils?\u201d\u201cWe're just looking for some fun. If Lou Mu Yan wins, then we'll sell the Spirit Tools from Hu Fei and Kang Rong1\u00a0and just take the money.\u201d The young man didn't care\u2014he was just looking for a little fun in his boring life.Ruan Li also knew this person's personality\u2014it was as if he feared there wasn't enough chaos in the world. He also didn't want to stop it. For a long time, they never liked Hu Fei, and letting them bet wasn't anything serious, \u201cI won't participate in your bet. I'll just be a witness.\u201dIn his heart, Lou Mu Yan was more promising, so he hoped the little girl wouldn't let him down.Meanwhile, Lou Mu Yan didn't know at all that her results in the grand competition were being used by several people as a bet and was currently attempting to breakthrough to Advanced-Phase Great Sword Master Stage.Half a month ago, she already used the Spiritual Energy accrued in her body to breakthrough to Middle-Phase Great Sword Master Stage.Recently, her dan'tian had been ceaselessly absorbing numerous Spirit Clouds again, to the point that the speed of conversion into Spiritual Energy was not as fast as the absorption speed. She decided to slow down and use the Spiritual Energy in her body to breakthrough once more, heading to Advanced-Phase Great Sword Master. As such, she could not only stabilise her cultivation base, but also provide more guarantees for the grand competition.1based on the characters used for the names, Hu Fei is the middle-aged man who dislikes Lou Mu Yan and Kang Rong is the normal-looking woman.Note: due to the start of daylight savings, this chapter and my following chapters may update at a different time where you guys live.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 47: The Grand Competition\u00a0BeginsOn the day before the Academy's grand competition, a large cluster of five-coloured clouds gathered in the sky above the small building. Once they condensed into a Spirit Cloud, they were naturally dragged into the small building by a gravitational force.Lou Mu Yan's dan'tian kept operating, and the slivers of Spiritual Force lingered around her dan'tian before a very pure Spiritual Energy spread from her dan'tian, replenishing each of her meridians, cleansing them again and again.After her whole body's meridians were saturated with Spiritual Energy, the remaining Spiritual Energy in her dan'tian turned into a light green mist that kept rotating. When the time came, the light green mist instantly spread and filled up her entire dan'tian.She sat cross-legged with her eyes closed as her hands changed gestures in front of her chest, forming various hand-seals.When the light green mist in her dan'tian was completely saturated, she suddenly opened her eyes and finished the last hand gesture. A pure energy came from within her body and the barrier between Middle-Phase Great Sword Master and Advanced-Phase Great Sword Master was shattered by the energy.Feeling that the Spiritual Energy was even more abundant, and that her strength rose yet another level, she smiled and exhaled a stale breath, \u201cSuccess!\u201dThe next day, at dawn, Lou Mu Yan withdrew the Array around the courtyard and exited the small building.She looked up at the scorching sun blooming in the sky as the breeze gently raised her elegant, purple clothes. Her entire person seemed to be shrouded in a layer of golden light.Today was the day she would rise from dormancy, and the shame she once bore would also be washed away. She desperately wanted to set foot on the path of the strong.After exiting the courtyard, she walked merrily towards the Imperial Academy's battle grounds.The Lou Mu Yan right now exuded a passionate and confident look. With her exceedingly bright and beautiful face, as well as her graceful bearing, there was even a sense of otherworldliness, causing the people around her to be unable to control their gazes.\u201cIs that Lou Mu Yan? Am I seeing things right?\u201d Someone whispered on the way.\u201cYou're not mistaken, it's her. I've heard long ago that she had changed, but who knew she'd change this much, so much that she's hardly recognisable.\u201d\u201cYeah! I've got to say, Lou Mu Yan's quite beautiful now, not at all inferior to Gu Yan Ran.\u201d\u201cForget it, no matter how beautiful she is, she's only trash that has the looks and nothing else. I sure want to see how she defeats Gu Yan Ran today. After talking so big, it'd be embarrassing to lose when the time came.\u201d A woman, who walked in front of the men, couldn't help but interject.\u201cThat's true. Gu Yan Ran is the most talented student in the Earth Class, and the most promising one who could obtain that only position in the Earth Class for the Trials. This time Lou Mu Yan is bound to be embarrassed.\u201d Mentioning Gu Yan Ran, the male student who spoke bore love in his eyes.\u201cNot only is she going to be embarrassed, but the face of the General's Mansion would all be lost. How is it that such an impressive person like Upperclassman Lou has such a shameless and trash sister\u2026\u201d Those that verbally attacked Lou Mu Yan were mostly female students.\u201cBut I heard that she's advanced to the Great Sword Master cultivation base, and the five-coloured Spirit Clouds that appeared last month in the sky was attracted by her when cultivating. Maybe she'll prove herself today.\u201d A male student from the Earth Class said.\u201cTsk, who knows what she used to attract the five-coloured Spirit Clouds. I won't believe she's really that amazing. Maybe it's a means to attract Chi Yi Xuan's attention.\u201d A female student who had a good relationship with Gu Yan Ran said with extreme distain. She didn't believe those rumours at all and suspected that they were all Lou Mu Yan's gimmicks.\u201cAren't you all thinking too highly of her? Even if she broke through to the cultivation base of a Great Sword Master with the help of the Marrow Cleansing Pill, but there are more than thirty people in the Great Sword Master cultivation base in the Earth Class. It's not certain that she and Gu Yan Ran would meet in the competition.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cEven if they aren't matched, they still promised, so the competition between the two will definitely take place. We just need to wait for a good show.\u201dEver since Lou Mu Yan exited, rumours about her had spread throughout the Imperial Academy. Aside from a few people who believed the rumours, the rest just lamented her luck to be able to obtain the Marrow Cleansing Pill, but didn't admit she was capable. The balance in more than two-thirds of the student body's hearts all leaned towards Gu Yan Ran.Lou Mu Yan wasn't interested in their whisperings or their loud discussions at all. Her gaze was natural and composed as she entered the Imperial Academy's Battle Grounds. She found a seat in the corner to sit down and wait for the beginning of the competition.Because her previous interpersonal relationships were very bad, she had no friends in the Imperial Academy, so no one approached her to start a conversation. There were some who came to enquire about the Marrow Cleansing Pill before, but she ignored them all, which made others feel that she was arrogant and domineering.But as if she'd bother to deal with those two-faced people. Because of her indifference, no one came forward to talk to her after she sat down in her seat. Even the empty seats around her weren't taken by anyone, deliberately isolating her.She leaned back in her chair lazily, closed her eyes and calmed her mind. There wasn't any excessive expression on her face, only calm and composure.After approximately a quarter of an hour, the raised platform with the seats of honour filled with people one by one. Then, as a pressuring voice sounded, the noise from all around stopped instantly, and everyone looked at the person on the high platform.\u201cToday is the biennial1\u00a0competition of our Imperial Academy. I am honoured to be elected as the referee of this grand competition.\u201d The person who spoke was a blue-clothed, handsome man\u2014precisely the man who brought up the bet that day.Lou Mu Yan opened her eyes and turned her gaze to the man who spoke. He was the Imperial Academy's youngest Sword King instructor, named Lan Si. She heard that he got along well around the Academy, and his background was also not simple.\u201cThe grand competition this time will be separate between the old and new students, and between the Heaven Class and Earth Class, and the results of the grand competition are directly linked to the subsequent Trials.\u201d Lan Si continued after a pause, \u201cWe will only decide the top eight students amongst the new and old students in the Heaven Class, and two for the new and old students in the Earth Class, with a total of ten places.\u201cI won't say anymore. I believe everyone knows the importance of the Trial after the grand competition. The allocation of resources of the Imperial Academy in the future depends on it.\u201cThere are a total of one-thousand-eight-hundred old and new students together participating in the competition, but only ten spots. So everyone must work hard!\u201dHearing what Lan Si said, the students who sat on the stage revealed excitement and fervour. With so many people, yet only ten places, they had to work hard.After Lan Si finished speaking, he announced the start of the grand competition. A total of thirty battle platforms were set up, with each platform lined with students. Each student would draw lots to decide their opponent.As long as they lost one round, then they were automatically eliminated. The eight winners of the Heaven Class would obtain a place in the Trials, while the Earth Class's situation was cruller as only the winner of the old students and the winner of the new students would be chosen for a place in the Trials.There were four referees on each platform, two responsible for maintaining the energy shield to prevent the fighting from affecting the outside, one was responsible for deciding the winner and loser, and the last one was responsible for calling up student names to draw their lots.Lou Mu Yan was placed on battle platform twenty-six. She got the number five lot, so her opponent was also the number five lot, which meant that they were the fifth battle on battle platform twenty-six.Gu Yan Ran was assigned to battle platform number one. After she finished drawing her lot, she casted a confrontational look at Lou Mu Yan, but Lou Mu Yan only smiled faintly and ignored it.Both of them were looking forward to the following competition in their hearts, and secretly thought that once they met on the battle platforms, they'd stomp each other down into the dust.1ooops, it was biennial, not annual. Time to go back and fix my translation haha. They never mentioned if it was annual or biennial, I translated \u5927\u6bd4 as 'annual competition' because I didn't know how else to translate it. Only when I was translating this chapter did I suddenly have a thought: 'grand competition' sounds good. Why didn't I think of that earlier\u2026?Note: Last daily double-update for now! Might only double-update during the weekends like before, susceptible to change.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 48: Grand Competition Begins\u00a01The Imperial Academy's annual competition this time determined a portion of the quota for the mysterious Trial of Yan'zhou Country. In addition, many children and disciples of distinguished clans and families cultivated at the Academy, therefore the Academy also specifically arranged seats for distinguished guests, such as those from the Imperial Family and the distinguished clans of the Empire, to view the competition.Today, Lou Zhan Tian also came with Lou Mo Yu and his two grandsons to watch Lou Mu Yan's competition. Their seats were positioned at the bottom left of the Emperor.While the seats next to the Lou Clan were actually the Gu Clan's patriarch Gu Yuan Kai, and Yun Tian Zong\u2014who knew who deliberately arranged it this way.After the few people met, Yun Tian Zong narrowed his eyes at Lou Mo Yu, then looked away after a cold huff.Gu Yuan Kai was a better schemer, so even though he had many conflicts with the Lou Clan, he smiled like the Budai Bodhisattva1\u00a0and greeted: \u201cMarshal Lou, General Lou.\u201dLou Zhan Tian nodded lightly while Lou Mo Yu smiled and nodded: \u201cPatriarch Gu.\u201dAfter greeting each other, the few stopped communicating, but when Yun Tian Zong spoke secretly to Gu Yuan Kai, he would occasionally glance at Lou Mo Yu coldly. Lou Mo Yu was naturally calm and composed, ignoring the completely unthreatening gaze.Lou Mu Bai didn't participate in the Grand Competition because he advanced to the Sword King Stage. He was specially granted a position in the Trial, agreed by the superiors in the Empire.Lou Mu Ting was originally going to return to the frontier, but because Lou Mu Yan was going to participate in the Academy's grand competition, he accompanied his family to watch the battle and cheer.\u201cMu Ting, you little kid, you've been back for a while now and didn't come to greet us, your old friends.\u201d Xiao Zi Ang sat behind Lou Mu Ting and reached out to poke Lou Mu Ting's back with a bitter tone.Yun Jin chuckled, \u201cXiao Zi Ang, what's with your expression? As if you're an abandoned little wife, how embarrassing.\u201d\u201cGo, go, don't bother me when I'm talking to Mu Ting.\u201d Xiao Zi Ang's face collapsed and pushed Yun Jin's handsome face, that had neared him, away from him.\u201cI was thrown into closed-door cultivation by grandpa the moment I came home. We'll have a get together again after the grand competition.\u201d Lou Mu Ting shrugged and lied without skipping a beat.He did shut himself up in the training room of the Lou Clan for closed-door cultivation, but that was because his elder brother and younger sister were simply abnormal, which gave him a sense of crisis. He didn't want to be left behind too far, so he worked harder. But he naturally wouldn't say these things in front of his good friends.\u201cMu Ting, the effect of your closed-door cultivation is pretty good. You've already broken through to Advanced-Phase Sword Spirit. Grandpa2\u00a0should really shut you in more often.\u201d Yun Lan looked at Lou Mu Ting, joking.Lou Mu Ting rolled his eyes. This was typical gloating\u2014they're such bad brothers.\u201cMu Ting, you hopping up two levels consecutively, does it have anything to do with the Marrow Cleansing Pill?\u201d Xiao Zi Ang was a person who couldn't keep his thoughts to himself, so he asked in a whisper after glancing around.Lou Mu Ting raised an eyebrow, with a tsundere expression3: \u201cThe Marrow Cleansing Pill isn't as miraculous as the rumours. It's obviously because of my excelling talent, ok?\u201dThe Marrow Cleansing Pill was indeed miraculous, but it was only in terms of broadening the meridians, washing the marrow and cleansing the body, but the progression of strength still depended on talent and hard work.He went from an Initial-Phase Sword Spirit to an Advanced-Phase Sword Spirit not just because the speed of him absorbing the Spiritual Force of Heaven and earth was more than doubled after taking the Marrow Cleansing Pill. He broke through also because his talent was quite good, accompanied by madly absorbing the Spiritual Force of heaven and earth and converting it into Elemental Energy.\u201cMy little sister said that the pill is just an assistance, cultivation still had to rely on one's own comprehension and hard work.\u201d Lou Mu Ting had always been a siscon4, so he unconditionally believed that whatever his little sister said was the truth.\u201cWho can tell that even Lou Mu Yan cam say such things.\u201d Xiao Zi Ang pursed his lips.\u201cWhy can't my little sister say these words. Xiao Zi Ang, is your skin itching5?\u201d Lou Mu Ting rolled up his sleeves, as if expressing 'you say another word and I'd beat you up'.Xiao Zi Ang glared at him, \u201cTrust you to discard your humanity for your younger sister.\u201dLou Mu Bai and Yun Lan looked at the bickering two in amusement\u2014seeing this sort of scene felt as if they were being taken back to many years ago.\u201cA'Lan, how are your preparations for this time's Trial?' Lou Mu Bai asked Yun Lan in a whisper.Yun Lan nodded: \u201cAlmost done. Elder brother is participating in the Trial this time for Yan'er right?\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksAs the number-one genius, with Lou Mu Bai's excelling talents, the three forces of Yan'zhou Country had long recognised him as not needing to participate in the Trial. It must be because of Lou Mu Yan that he insisted on participating in the Trial.Speaking of Lou Mu Yan, Lou Mu Bai's expression warmed, \u201cMm.\u201d\u201cThe grand competition has begun.\u201d Yun Luo suddenly interjected as he looked down. They stopped talking and all turned their eyes to the battle platform below.The first four matches on battle platform twenty-six were all not very strong, so the battles were quickly over.When it was the fifth battle, the moment the referee finished calling up the contestants, Lou Mu Yan saw a young man leap atop the battle platform.This man was a student from a different Earth Class and had no interactions with her. He was at the Middle-Phase Great Sword Master cultivation base.With a tap of her toe, Lou Mu Yan also leapt onto the battle platform.\u201cWhen one of you falls off from the battle platform, you lose. Of course, if one of you voluntarily admits defeat, it also means that the battle is over.\u201d The referee waved the yellow flag in his hands and announced: \u201cThe battle begins.\u201d\u201cPlease go easy.\u201d The man on the opposite side cupped his hands respectfully at Lou Mu Yan. Without leaving her any time to speak, he mobilised his Elemental Energy, channelling it into the long sword in his hand and swung at Lou Mu Yan.Lou Mu Yan was indifferent, used Flash Step, and quickly dodged the sword aura from the opposing side.The difference in strength was too big so there wasn't any challenge for her. She didn't take out any weapons, only moved her feet, and her afterimages vanished from the battle platform.Before anyone could see clearly, she already moved behind her opponent, and with a strike of her palm, her opponent flew out of the battle platform.[Wow!!] The students watching below were stunned, their mouth open wide in disbelief. Wasn't this a bit too exaggerated.Because Lou Mu Yan had always been famous throughout the Imperial Academy, even if it was negative news, it'd be followed with interest, not to mention her promised battle with Gu Yan Ran, so when she hopped onto the battle platform to compete, many people focused their attention on battle platform twenty-six.But what all parties didn't expect was that Lou Mu Yan would have such an easy fight as her first battle. She defeated a Middle-Phase Great Sword Master with one move. Who spread the rumour that she was only an Initial-Phase Great Sword Master? It was just nonsense.Seeing that his granddaughter was so decisive, Lou Zhan Tian couldn't help but smile and said: \u201cYan'er did great.\u201dYun Tian Chen was sitting in the front row, and also paid attention to Lou Mu Yan. Although he was shocked, but he was satisfied with this result, so he turned his head with a smile and said: \u201cAs expected of this little girl who's from the Lou Clan. When she battles, she has the courage and decisiveness of a solider.\u201d\u201cHaha, Emperor is right.\u201d Lou Zhan Tian laughed loudly and accepted Yun Tian Chen's praise without any humility.Gu Yuan Kai, who sat next to him, had a gloomy look in his eyes, but he smiled kindly without any words.Yun Tian Zong snorted coldly: \u201cIt's only the first battle, what's there to be so proud of.\u201d\u201cSo what if this old man is proud, are you unconvinced?\u201d Lou Zhan Tian had always had a straightforward temperament. Whoever said anything negative about his granddaughter, he'd argue with them.1the laughing buddha, always happy and smiling nicely.2technically the words he uses indicate that it's his maternal grandpa. There are two ways of calling your grandpa\u2014one way by the kids of your son, and another way by the kids of your daughter. But might just stick with 'grandpa' unless I need to make clear who's who.3thought long and hard, but decided to go with 'tsundere', because the Chinese word (\u50b2\u5a07) is literally a loanword from the Japanese 'tsundere'. It means to be cold and distant, but only acts this way because he's embarrassed and shy.3I think it's also a loanword from Japan. The Chinese is \u59b9\u63a7. It means to have a sister complex, a state of liking one's younger sister very much. In Lou Mu Ting's case, he's just very protective, believes whatever Lou Mu Yan does/says is right, won't take other's berating of Lou Mu Yan etc. I just googled sister complex and its definition gets rather out of hand. Don't worry, it won't go any weird or extreme routes HAHA.4meaning, is he looking for a beating?Note: Yay the typical 'surpise guys, I'm strong' trope. XD Can't get enough of those tbh. Let's see what happens next~Random side note: What a gore fest the drama Squid Game is. Ep 7 here I come. Let's see how the drama ends.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 49: Grand Competition\u00a02There were one-thousand-eight-hundred students participating in the grand competition, divided into thirty battle platforms, with sixty people each platform, paired up to compete in elimination rounds.After the first round, Lou Mu Yan continued to draw lots amongst the remaining students on this battle platform, and drew lot number eight.Her performance earlier shocked many people, and the people in her group looked at her with faint fear.The match just now actually didn't mean much, after all, Lou Mu Yan's opponent's was rather weak. But because the image of her being trash was so deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, it caused this unexpected sensation.Gu Yan Ran stood not far away, and seeing Lou Mu Yan win her first round so easily, her eyes that was initially calm revealed a trace of hostility.Chi Yi Xuan had also been paying attention to Lou Mu Yan. Ever since he won, his gaze had been locked on to battle platform number twenty-six.Seeing her competing relaxedly and with ease, her hair fluttering in the wind, and her appearance so beautiful and refined, his heart couldn't help but beat like a drum. But it was just a momentary thing.After the lot was drawn, Lou Mu Yan automatically ignored the incessant discussions below, walked to her seat and casually scanned the battles on the other platforms.The ferocity level in the Earth Class was much more inferior to the Heaven Class, so apart from the few occasional battles that attracted many people's attention, there wasn't much popularity.An hour later, the referee announced the second round of the eighth match.There was no suspense in the battle, Lou Mu Yan soon ended the battle and won.She continued to draw lots, continued to win, all the way until the last competition on platform number twenty-six.Lou Mu Yan leapt onto the stage with a tap of her toe all the same. This time, her opponent was a pink-clothed woman named Yi Nuo who was rather attractive. She was in the same Earth Class as her, was also the strongest in their class, and was a highly regarded Sword Master.It was just that the relationship between her and Yi Nuo was rather stiff, and they had numerous conflicts. This woman usually spoke badly about her behind her back, followed Gu Yan Ran in embarrassing her, not to mention she once even almost killed her.\u201cLou Mu Yan, I'm not the trash that battled with you before.\u201d There was disdain in Yi Nuo's eyes, \u201cLet me end your grand competition this time.\u201dLou Mu Yan folded her arms, wearing a smile, yet not quite a smile, on her face, while there wasn't much warmth in her eyes. Just how confident was this woman to be able to say these absolute words.End her participation in the grand competition? What a joke.Since they were matched, then it was perfect. She had always wanted to calculate the debt from this woman.The favour of a meal must be repaid, while revenge must be taken on grievances as well. Her temperament was as such, knowing to whom she should show gratitude, and to whom she should resent.\u201cWatch what you're saying, who ends who will only be known after a battle.\u201d Lou Mu Yan didn't bother to spend anymore words, turned her head to the referee on the battle stage and said: \u201cLet's start.\u201dSeeing that both of them were ready, the referee repeated the rules, then announced 'the battle begins'.Seeing Lou Mu Yan's indifferent attitude towards her, as if she was insignificant, a feeling of discomfort rose in Yi Nuo's heart. What right did this trash have to dislike her? She would definitely show Lou Mu Yan who's stronger today, and let her know that Chi Yi Xuan wasn't someone a trash like her could think about.Yes, one of the reasons Yi Nuo often targeted Lou Mu Yan was because she adored Chi Yi Xuan, and she didn't like seeing a woman like Lou Mu Yan who only got close to Chi Yi Xuan because of her family background. In her eyes, Lou Mu Yan liking Chi Yi Xuan was a sort of defilement.\u201cAccept your death!\u201d Yi Nuo took out a silver longsword and channelled her Elemental Energy into it.She leapt up and swung her sword in the air. The gleam of the sword that carried a thick, cold aura instantly turned into a blue sword aura and headed directly for Lou Mu Yan.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksLou Mu Yan could feel the blue sword aura carried the pressure of an Advanced-Phase Great Sword Master. It appeared that Yi Nuo trained her sword skill well, but it was a pity that her abilities were still lacking.Such strength wasn't even worthy for her to draw her own sword. She quickly formed a few hand-seals in front of her chest. With a flick of her slender hands, a flash of red that carried the fire Elemental Energy shot out, heading directly towards the blue sword aura.[CHICHI!] In just an instant, the blue sword energy was completely submerged by the fire, and let out a few sizzling sounds in the air.\u201cWhat?\u201d Yi Nuo never thought that Lou Mu Yan had such abilities. She put away the belittling in her heart and her face darkened\u2014this trash should consider herself lucky for making her use all her powers.\u201cYou're able to make me use this skill, Lou Mu Yan, you're very fortunate.\u201d Yi Nuo huffed, her silver longsword incessantly swung in the air, then immediately following, the sword aura condensed into numerous blue petals and floated towards Lou Mu Yan.\u201cSword Aura Condensation!\u201d Yun Lan whispered on the audience seats, his brows deeply knitted, then looked at Yun Jin: \u201cShe's a member of the Yi Clan?\u201dSword Aura Condensation used to be the Yi Clan's peerless skill trump card. A few hundred years ago, they had hopes of ranking amongst the Ten Distinguished Spirit Sword Clans, but because they offended a large force, they were suppressed miserably. Later, because the talents of the Clan were grew weaker and weaker, they gradually declined, and were now not even ranked in Yan'zhou Country.This peerless skill, Sword Aura Condensation, was also lost a hundred years ago, but who would've thought it was unexpectedly used by this woman.\u201cMm. She's named Yi Nuo, is the granddaughter of the current patriarch of the Yi Clan, and also the most talented disciple of the Clan. That's why she was sent to the Imperial Academy.\u201dThere was worry in Yun Jin's eyes, \u201cI didn't expect that she could use Sword Aura Condensation, no wonder she previously declared that she would take the only spot allocated to the Earth Class. So it turned out she had such a trump card.\u201d He wondered if Lou Mu Yan could take this attack.Yun Jin would participate in the Trials with the members of the Imperial Family, so he didn't compete in the Academy's selection for the Trials.\u201cYan'er can handle it.\u201d Unlike Yun Lan and Yun Jin's worries, Lou Mu Bai's indifferent eyes were stained with a layer of determination.Seeing his younger sister's complacent and calm appearance on the battle platform, Lou Mu Ting couldn't help but believe she'd win. \u201cYan'er will definitely win.\u201dXiao Zi Ang and Yun Luo exchanged glances. Where did the confidence in these two brothers come from? The reason why Sword Aura Condensation is called a peerless skill must have its reasons.\u201cI also believe in Lou Mu Yan.\u201d Yun Lan pressed his lips together, staring at the battle platform, transfixed.Yun Jin didn't speak, but his clenched hands revealed he was not calm at this time.Lou Mu Yan's eyes revealed slight surprise. This woman's sword skills weren't bad, except the person using it was too weak. She didn't even comprehend the key to this skill, yet she used it so confidently. Yi Nuo was too arrogant\u2014an arrogant soldier was bound to be defeated.She converted part of the Spiritual Energy within her into fire Elemental Energy, once again formed another Taoist Seal with her hands, then with a flick of her jade-like fingers, numerous life-like, fire lotuses hopped off her fingertips, as if blooming gorgeously like real ones.The fire lotuses that floated in front of Lou Mu Yan were even more dazzling and eye-catching than the blue petals. Upon the release of the fire lotuses, the temperature around the battle platform rose steadily, shocking the people.\u201cWhat?\u201d Ruan Yang, who sat on the raised platform, pushed himself up to his feet with his hands on the armrests and stared at Lou Mu Yan on the platform, \u201cThat little girl was this competent in using her fire Elemental Energy, not at all inferior to the Yi Clan's Sword Aura Condensation.\u201cWhat a great seedling!\u201d Then he slapped his thigh and looks sideways at Yuan Li, \u201cShe's only at the Great Sword Master cultivation base, yet she was able to comprehend the fire attribute Elemental Energy to this stage\u2014she was simply born to refine pills. I want this little girl.\u201dRuan Li retracted the amazement in his eyes. The girl from the Lou Clan was constantly giving them surprises. Remembering the mysterious figure behind Lou Mu Yan who refined the Marrow Cleansing Pill, he couldn't help but pour cold water on his younger brother1: \u201cAnother person has long accepted her as their disciple. You're a step too late.\u201dRuan Yang froze \u2013 that's right! This girl had already become someone else's disciple, and he was afraid that it would be difficult to accept him as a Master.It was truly a pity\u2014such a good seedling was dug out by another Alchemist. Which old thing had such sharp eyes?\u201cAye!\u201d Ruan Li sighed, but the fiery desire in his eyes that looked at Lou Mu Yan still hadn't faded. It was rare to encounter such a talented seedling, he wouldn't be reconciled if he didn't at least try.1burst his bubble. To extinguish his excitement by giving him some unfortunate facts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The two forces, one condensed with the ice attribute Elemental Energy, and the other condensed with the fire attribute Elemental Energy clashed in mid-air.The sky above the two of them clashed into magnificent sparks of colour. The moment the blue petals touched the fire lotus, it turned into countless sword auras that attempted to disperse the fire lotus Elemental Energy.But it was a pity that the moment the countless blue sword auras touched the fire lotus, it was annihilated by the dancing crimson flames, leaving behind only a trace of a blue phantom after it had dissipated.After the fire lotuses annihilated all the energy of the blue petals, it didn't disappear, and instead, the flowers converged and condensed, eventually turning into a captivating, majestic fire lotus that slowly bloomed in the air.\u201cGo!\u201d Lou Mu Yan said coldly.As her voice fell, the fire lotus spun around, and like a meteor, passed by, directly heading towards Yi Nuo.After Yi Nuo's condensed sword aura petals were obliterated by Lou Mu Yan's fire lotus, the calm and arrogant look in her eyes suddenly changed. She quickly mobilised her body's Elemental Energy and formed hand-seals, attempting to launch a counterattack.Except she only just finished her Taoist Seal, but the fire lotus that Lou Mu Yan had condensed landed above her head.Yi Nuo's face paled, gritted her teeth, poured her entire body's Elemental Energy into her longsword, and struck at the fire lotus with all her might.A blue sword aura flew out like a whirlwind, directly across the blooming fire lotus. The fire lotus suddenly split apart after the sword aura landed, as if it was defeated.Yi Nuo's pale face revealed an arrogant smile. Her Yi Clan's sword skills weren't something that was easy to break. But her smile had yet to fully bloom before it froze on her face.The fire lotus that had split didn't collapse, nor merge, but turned into numerous bright red petals that peeled off the fire lotus, scattering with a majestic beauty from the air.At this time, everyone on the platforms were attracted by the gorgeous and dazzling moves of battle platform number twenty-six. Even the students that were battling unanimously stopped their fights and collectively looked towards the battle platform together.After Lou Mu Yan condensed the blooming fire lotuses, most of the people were shocked. When the lotus petals peeled off and completely resisted Yi Nuo's sword aura, many people's jaws dropped, staring at the platform in disbelief.Lotus petals drifted downwards but didn't immediately sink into Yi Nuo's body. Instead, they scattered around her in pieces. When she swung her sword to destroy the attack, the petals suddenly closed in on her body, spun around and lifted the person off the floor.The people on the field were dumbfounded. How could this be possible? Fire Elemental Energy condensation could change state at will? Their eyes weren't blurred right\u2026Slight horror rose on Yi Nuo's face. Her body was held up by the flaming lotus petals, and even when she wanted to counter, the Elemental Energy in her body felt as if it was locked by something, unable to use, and she wasn't able to move either.The lotus petals hovered and flew, supporting Yi Nuo's body over the battle platform. Everyone's eyes moved closely with Yi Nuo's body, and they couldn't think of what Lou Mu Yan wanted to do.Lou Mu Yan smiled slightly, stretched out her right hand and snapped her fingers, then the falling lotus petals immediately turned into wisps of fire that wrapped around Yi Nuo.\u201cAH!\u201d The piercing pain went deep into her bones, and Yi Nuo couldn't help but let out a shriek of pain.Everyone watching the battle saw Yu Nuo's whole body wrapped in a blinding red light, as she convulsing and twitched within while her screams resounded: \u201cAHH!!\u201d. It made their scalp feel numb1.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThe referees pupils constricted, coughed lightly, then looked at Lou Mu Yan and said: \u201cYou can't take one's life during the grand competition. Put her down quickly, you won this battle.\u201d\u201cI'm just letting her suffer a little, it won't harm her life.\u201d Lou Mu Yan's eyes flashed with fierceness, and questioned the referee sharply: \u201cHas she been beaten out of the battle platform? Did she take the initiative to give up?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d The referee replied with an unhappy expression.Lou Mu Yan smiled beautifully, wuth her expression faintly carrying a sense of evil, \u201cThen why should I put her down? This competition isn't over yet.\u201dHer fire Elemental Energy condensation was controlled very well, so it wouldn't endanger Yi Nuo's life, but the woman had to bear the burning pain of the fire energy, like scraping the bone marrow. Of course, there would definitely be aftereffects. It would probably be impossible for Yi Nuo to break through to the strength of a Sword Monarch in this life.If Yi Nuo just talked badly behind her back, and merely confronted her a few times, then she wouldn't do this today.But half a year ago, during an outdoor training experience organised by the Academy, Yi Nuo, under Gu Yan Ran's instigation, tricked her into the wilderness using Chi Yi Xuan's name, and secretly drove Demonic Beasts to attack her.She was bitten in numerous places, trampled and accidentally fell off a cliff. It was a miracle she was able to escape and survive.It was just that the former Lou Mu Yan was afraid that Chi Yi Xuan would be involved in this matter, so when her family found her, she only said that she accidentally provoked a group of Demonic Beasts. Otherwise with the Lou Clan's protectiveness, the Yi Clan and Yi Nuo would've long been taken care off. As if Yi Nuo could've been free for so long.Lou Mu Yan admitted that although she acted cold, but she never took the initiative to kill people. Behaviours like those of Yi Nuo and Gu Yan Ran's, however, were unbearable to her. The grudges they forged couldn't be described as deep, but the two girls constantly wanted to put her to death, so don't blame her for being cruel.\u201cAH!\u201d Yi Nuo's miserable screams didn't stop, \u201cWuwu\u2026\u201d Then she screamed as she sobbed.She couldn't stand it anymore. She had never experienced such pain. It was worse than death. She didn't dare anymore, she didn't dare provoke Lou Mu Yan anymore.\u201cYi Nuo, does this feel good?\u201d Lou Mu Yan snapped her fingers again and the flames that enveloped Yi Nuo retreated, leaving only four wisps around her hands and feet.The tears in Yi Nuo's eyes streamed down ceaselessly. She bit her lower lip and shook her head, wanting to surrender, yet she simply couldn't speak.\u201cUncomfortable?\u201d Lou Mu Yan sneered, \u201cToday is just to repay the grievance that I experienced from you when you lured me into the group of Demonic Beasts and almost killed me. Remember this. If you dare provoke me again next time, I will definitely make your life worse than death by numerous fold.\u201dShe always believed that the best revenge against her enemy wasn't to let her die, but to let her live worse than death.Hearing Lou Mu Yan's voice that wasn't quite loud nor soft, some of those that felt that she was too cruel and ruthless suddenly understood. So it was because Yi Nuo once tried to entrap Lou Mu Yan\u2014no wonder she would use this method to punish her today.The few people who had previously competed against Lou Mu Yan all winced, feeling a sense of lingering fear. It appeared that Lou Mu Yan was truly merciful towards them before. Luckily they didn't offend Lou Mu Yan, otherwise if they ended up like the tragic stage Yi Nuo was in right now, who couldn't beg to live, yet also couldn't beg to die, just thinking about it made them feel terrified and numb in the heads.Gu Yan Ran was also shocked by the battle between the two. Although she and Yi Nuo weren't in the same Earth Class, but they usually had a good relationship. At the same time, they feared each other, because their strengths were rather similar.But right now Yi Nuo was trapped by Lou Mu Yan and suffered inhumane torture. It would be a lie if she said she wasn't guilty of anything.She stared at Lou Mu Yan angrily, touched the silver bangle on her hand, and suppressed the panic in her heart.She wasn't Yi Nuo. She still had a trump card. She didn't have to fear Lou Mu Yan at all.Remembering her trump card, she gradually stabilised her mind, and the hostility in her eyes grew thicker. She would definitely win, definitely\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just as he was about to announce Lou Mu Yan's victory, he saw Lou Mu Yan gently wave her sleeve, and the condensed Elemental Energy flames that entangled Yi Nuo threw her out of the battle platform and let her fall heavily onto the ground.\u201cTeacher Referee, are you not going to judge?\u201d Lou Mu Yan raised her head slightly and looked at the referee, asking.The referee on battle platform number twenty-six was taken aback, then immediately announced: \u201cThe winner of the last match is Lou Mu Yan!\u201dHe was truly dissatisfied by Lou Mu Yan's actions before, but he gradually calmed after hearing that she was almost killed. Regardless of who, if they were tricked like that, they'd also feel unfair and retaliate. Now it also seemed that Lou Mu Yan indeed didn't hurt Yi Nuo's life and didn't break the rules, so it was only natural she won.In a world where the strong was respected, as long as one had strength, one could win respect. The fact that Lou Mu Yan won Yi Nuo and could condense fire attribute Elemental Energy was considered strength. Even if she was once famous as trash, but after today, her title of 'trash' would be completely removed.[WOW!!] After the referee announced the result, the students in the audience couldn't help but start an uproar.What did they see? Lou Mu Yan actually used her condensed fire Elemental Energy to completely defeat Yi Nuo's condensed sword aura.The competition just now was like watching a beautiful performance. The blue petals, the delicate and charming fire lotus, the miserable shrieks, it all truly stimulated them.\u201cI didn't see wrong did I? Is that person really Lou Mu Yan?\u201d The classmate who watched Lou Mu Yan from the side seats couldn't help but push the person next to him, still unable to believe what he saw just now.The person beside him also rubbed his eyes and nodded blankly. \u201cThat's definitely Lou Mu Yan. Who knew that after she eradicated her Terminal Meridians constitution, she'd become this powerful.\u201d\u201cA trash like Lou Mu Yan actually defeated Yi Nuo, it's simply unbelievable.\u201d\u201cYou're trash. If Lou Mu Yan's trash now, then aren't we even worse than trash?\u201d\u201cNo wonder she dared to promise a fight with Gu Yan Ran. With such strength, she's qualified to compete for the last spot in the Earth Class. Say, who do you guys think will win, her or Gu Yan Ran?\u201d\u201cI still support Gu Yan Ran.\u201d\u201cI'm actually more optimistic about Lou Mu Yan now. I like her ruthlessness.\u201d\u201cIt's better for a woman to be as gentle as water like Gu Yan Ran. Who dares to want a woman like Lou Mu Yan?\u201d\u201cTsk, what's so good about being gentle like water, it's better to be wild.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The students' discussions surged one wave after the other, and although it was unbelievable, but seeing was believing. They all saw Lou Mu Yan's current strength, and she deserved their high regards.Some people that were originally optimistic about Gu Yan Ran in regard to their battle now couldn't help but tilt their balance towards Lou Mu Yan.Chi Yi Xuan stared with a fierce desire at the gorgeous purple figure on the battle platform, and that calm heart that had settled started rippling as if a stone had been thrown into a calm, deep pond. And that stone was the woman he once abandoned.\u201cHaha, congratulations Marshal, your family's little girl sure hid herself very well.\u201d Yun Tian Chen packed away the emotions in his eyes, lifted his head and congratulated Lou Zhan Tian with a smile.\u201cI thank Your Majesty for the praise, my family's Yan'er is naturally good!\u201d Lou Zhan Tian was in a very comfortable mood, and he was exceptionally delighted. His family's little girl had finally grown up.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksGu Yuan Kai, who sat beside them smiled somewhat reluctantly. Lou Mu Yan had exceeded their expectations\u2014it seemed she couldn't be left alive.Yun Tian Zong's expression was as dark as ink. He and Gu Yuan Kai exchanged a secret look, and both saw the killing intent in each other's eyes. One Lou Mu Bai already caused them headaches, and now another Lou Mu Yan came out. Just how lucky were the Lou Clan.\u201cHow unexpected, how unexpected!\u201d Xiao Zi Ang stretched out his hand and pinched his arm. He immediately let go in pain\u2014it seemed that what he saw just now wasn't an illusion.\u201cMu Ting, your younger sister sure hid it all very well! It's only been a short while from the time she eradicated her Terminal Meridians constitution and started cultivating, until now. To think she could condense fire Elemental Energy, what an abnormality!\u201d Xiao Zi Ang patted Lou Mu Ting's shoulder, then glanced at Lou Mu Bai in his peripheral vision\u2014it truly was like elder brother, like younger sister1.\u201cMy little sister's talent is of course exceptional. Even I'm ashamed of my inadequacy, so you really don't need to be jealous and envious.\u201d Lou Mu Ting's lips raised. Even he didn't expect that his younger sister would become so powerful in such a short time, so the excitement couldn't be calmed for a long time.Yun Lan's gaze had been focused on the calm, purple figure on the battle platform, and there was an inexpressible joy in his heart.The worried look in Yun Jin's eyes was replaced by surprise. He just knew that the girl wouldn't be defeated so easily. The self-confident and indifferent temperament attracted his attention more and more, and she was even more interesting now.Lou Mu Bai's cold black eyes were dyed with a bright colour and his lips were slightly curled. His family's little girl hadn't even used her all yet.Lou Mo Yu let go of his tightly clenched hands. His treasured daughter truly acted upon what she was determined to do, hacking through brambles and thorns2, taking a large step towards the road of the strong.\u201cI remember that the Lou Clan's little girl and Gu Clan's little girl had promised a battle before the grand competition. I wonder who'll obtain the only place of the Earth Class.\u201d The Prime Minister turned his head and glanced at Lou Zhan Tian and Gu Yuan Kai, as if joking around.Gu Yuan Kai smiled softly and replied humbly: \u201cAlthough Yan Ran's talent isn't bad, but it really is hard to predict the outcome against the current Young Miss Lou.\u201d However, in his heart, he firmly believed that his daughter would win. After all, that trump card was given to her by him.Lou Zhan Tian raised his eyebrow with a look of pride and said naturally: \u201cOf course my family's Yan'er would get the last spot.\u201dHis granddaughter was the best, how could a small thing like Gu Yan Ran compare to his family's Yan'er.Hearing Lou Zhan Tian's words, the surrounding officials couldn't help but twitch the corners of their mouths. This old thing sure wasn't humble. If Lou Mu Yan was defeated by Gu Yan Ran afterwards, they'll see where he'll place that old face of his3.A cloud of haze quickly crossed Gu Yuan Kai's eyes. This damned old man truly talked big. So what if Lou Mu Yan defeated Yi Nuo? In front of his daughter, she would always be foil. He'd just wait and watch when Lou Zhan Tian slapped his own face4.After that, Lou Mu Yan and Gu Yan Ran continued to draw lots and compete, but coincidentally, they weren't paired up.After four more rounds, both of them defeated their opponents and advanced to the finals.And this time, even if there wasn't any promised battle, the two people who were like water and fire would inevitably meet and participate in the final competition, competing for the only Trial quota for the Earth Class.After resting for nearly an hour, the Heaven Class's battle also came to an end. Chi Yi Xuan lived up to the expectations and won the first place in the Heaven Class between the new students, and directly received a place in the Trials.Because of the larger number of people in the Earth Class, when Lou Mu Yan and Gu Yan Ran began their final battle, the competitions in the surrounding battle platforms had all ended.But none of the students left after the battle as they all sat in the audience seats, eagerly waiting.They wanted to see just who would win the final Trial quota\u2014the former number one trash of the Academy, or Gu Yan Ran, who was secretly judged by them as the Earth Class's number one student amongst the new students.1play on like father like son idiom.2idiom meaning to go though many difficulties.3if she loses, he'll naturally lose face, so it's a play on words. If she lost, then they look forward to his reaction after 'losing his face'.4figuratively, not literally.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

For example, Gu Yan Ran held a cyan longsword which meant that the Elemental Energy she comprehended was the wind attribute.Lou Mu Yan had a longsword before, but it wasn't suitable for her, so she wanted to refine her own Natal Magic Treasure after reaching Foundation Establishment Stage. If she was given a choice, then she would definitely only choose the one that suited her best. If it wasn't to her liking, then she'd rather fight with bare hands.\u201cLou Mu Yan, even if you aren't trash, I'll still defeat you today.\u201d Gu Yan Ran wore pink clothes, with a deliberate expression of softness and beauty, but the hidden cruelty in her eyes destroyed the gracefulness and softness quite a bit.Lou Mu Yan sneered, \u201cWinning or losing isn't determined by talking about it. Yi Nuo screamed louder than you, but what ending did she have?\u201d\u201cI'm different to Yi Nuo.\u201d Seeing Lou Mu Yan's indifferent look that didn't regard her highly, Gu Yan Ran wanted desperately to go up and tear apart that face that was more beautiful than hers.\u201cYou two are indeed different, so the gift I'll give you won't be worse than Yi Nuo's.\u201d Lou Mu Yan chuckled softly, and her beautiful eyes revealed a sense of anticipation. It had been a long time since she had a good fight\u2014she hoped Gu Yan Ran wouldn't let her down.Gu Yan Ran clenched the longsword in her hand tighter, but she deliberately spoke with tenderness, pretending to be generous, saying: \u201cLou Mu Yan, I didn't want to hurt you, but you forced me today.\u201d\u201cYou can stop being noisy with that disgustingly sweet voice. If you want to fight, then let's fight, if you don't want to fight, then get lost.\u201d It wasn't that Lou Mu Yan didn't like delicate and beautiful women, but she really couldn't appreciate Gu Yan Ran's fake delicateness.\u201cYou're courting death.\u201d Gu Yan Ran no longer pretended. Against such a person like Lou Mu Yan who didn't play by the rules, nor understood what gentleness was, Gu Yan Ran was also helpless. It was like punching cotton, she just wanted to vent even more.Gu Yan Ran's cultivation base was already at Peak-Phase Great Sword Master Stage. With one fortuitous opportunity, she could breakthrough to Sword Spirit. In addition, her talent was indeed superior, that's why she was called the number one person in the Earth Class.She channelled wind attribute Elemental Energy to her foot, and her body instantly lightened. Using the wind attribute, she flew into the air and looked down at Lou Mu Yan.She admitted that Lou Mu Yan's fire element condensation was indeed powerful, but she had long prepared ahead. As long as she could beat Lou Mu Yan in speed, then it'd be difficult for the condensed fire lotus to hurt her.Lou Mu Yan's battle experience was far more abundant than anyone present, so she naturally saw through Gu Yan Ran's plans. A faint expression of ridicule rose on her lips\u2014she didn't only know how to use fire Elemental Energy condensation.\u201cWind blade, go.\u201d Gu Yan Ran quietly condensed the wind element attack the moment the referee announced the start of the battle.At this moment, she applied the wind energy on her cyan longsword, and with a strong wave of her hand, numerous sword aura wind blades, glowing cyan, flew in Lou Mu Yan's direction.Yi Nuo had comprehended the ice attribute Elemental Energy, so Lou Mu Yan's fire attribute Elemental Energy perfectly suppressed it, but it wouldn't have any effect on her wind attribute.Lou Mu Yan didn't take out any Spirit Tools, and only stood on the spot, looking up to watch the groups of cyan light attack her.\u201cDid Lou Mu Yan become an idiot? Why isn't she moving?\u201d Someone in the audience below asked the person beside them upon seeing Lou Mu Yan still standing in her original position, with the same posture, and without any intentions of retaliating.The person beside also looked up at the upright and elegant purple figure on the platform, \u201cJust keep watching and we'll know.\u201dEveryone couldn't figure out why Lou Mu Yan didn't make a move. Could it be that Gu Yan Ran's wind blade frightened her? But that didn't seem likely!Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksBut before the people on the stands could react, the masses of wind blades fell on her.\u201cAH!\u201d Someone had been too focused, and couldn't help yelling when the wind blades landed on Lou Mu Yan. But the scream only just rose when their mouth immediately shut and stared at the battle platform blankly.All everyone saw were the wind blades passing through Lou Mu Yan's body, but when the wind blade's energy landed on one of the corners of the battle platform, Lou Mu Yan's figure on the battle platform had disappeared.\u201cHow's that possible?\u201d The slight pride in Gu Yan Ran's expression changed\u2014how could Lou Mu Yan escape her wind blade. Where is she?\u201cHere.\u201d Lou Mu Yan's figure suddenly appeared in mid-air behind Gu Yan Ran, stretched out her hand and lightly struck Gu Yan Ran's left shoulder.Gu Yan Ran's pupils constricted, but she was too late to guard herself. Pain struck her left shoulder, as if something was corroding it, and she stumbled back. If it weren't for the wind attribute Elemental Energy support beneath her feet, she would've fallen to the ground.\u201cHow fast!\u201d With Yun Jin's cultivation base and eyesight, he could naturally see that the wind blade didn't hit Lou Mu Yan at all, but was instead quickly avoided by her.But even he could only barely see the afterimages flashing a few times before vanishing, and the next thing he knew, he discovered Lou Mu Yan appearing behind Gu Yan Ran.\u201cLou Mu Yan, you dare to sneak an attack on me?\u201d Gu Yan Ran's expression darkened, and her left shoulder suddenly felt extreme pain.Lou Mu Yan raised an eyebrow: \u201cThere's no such thing as a sneak attack on the battlefield. It's because you're inferior to others.\u201dGu Yan Ran glared at Lou Mu Yan and quickly tapped the acupoints on her left shoulder to relieve the pain. There was irritability in her heart, and she channelled wave after wave of Elemental Energy into her cyan longsword.The cyan longsword in her hand made a 'buzzing' sound and spontaneously flew before Lou Mu Yan, stopping her from her plan to advance. Then the longsword immediately scattered, transforming into ten phantoms that surrounded Lou Mu Yan.\u201cNow this is slightly interesting.\u201d Lou Mu Yan casually glanced at the ten wind attribute sword auras. Gu Yan Ran's sword aura couldn't condense but this was a prototype of a Sword Array composed by sword auras.\u201cKill!\u201d With Gu Yan Ran's low growl, the ten sword auras instantly levelled out flat, and pierced towards Lou Mu Yan.Lou Mu Yan sneered, then used her Flash Step to manoeuvre incessantly in the air. Her ring hand wasn't idle either as she flexibly drew a talisman in the air.Those ten sword auras kept chasing her footsteps, and while she was extremely fast, the moment she dodged one, the other nine immediately followed.The sword aura brushed past her relentlessly. As she kept waving her fingers in the air, chains of yellow characters leapt out and reflected in the eyes of the audience.\u201cBreak!\u201d Lou Mu Yan stopped drawing talismans in the void, her red lips slightly opened, the 'Break' character crept out of her mouth, and immediately blended in with the yellow talisman incantation in the sky.The translucent yellow talisman incantation rose in the air and gradually grew larger. When it turned into a giant talisman incantation, it slammed downwards, destroying the ten sword auras that surrounded her with much ease like crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood1.After the sword aura collapsed, she joined two fingers together on her right hand, drew a few circles in front of her, and before the yellow talisman incantations disappeared, they suddenly became the size of a palm and shot towards Gu Yan Ran at lightning speed.Gu Yan Ran's expression changed, quickly took out a Spirit Tool to guard her chest, but the yellow talisman incantation directly penetrated the shield Spirit Tool, and instantly entered her body.1an idiom meaning it was easyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It's actually drawing talismans in the void!\u201dRuan Li and the other superiors of the Empire couldn't help but exclaim when they saw the yellow talisman incantations that could change size freely and destroy Gu Yan Ran's sword aura.\u201cThe Spiritual Force that fluctuated on that Void Talisman is so pure.\u201d Ruan Li narrowed his eyes as it gleamed brightly.\u201cThe little girl of the Lou Clan sure hid herself well!\u201d An old man in a sackcloth garment sitting beside Ruan Li couldn't help but sigh\u2014she truly was a person who 'normally performed with average results, but would then amaze the world with a single feat1'.Ruan Yang couldn't help but praise: \u201cGood seedling. I'm afraid this talent even surpasses her eldest brother Lou Mu Bai.\u201d If such a good seedling could formally recognise him as her master, then that would be even better.\u201cNo wonder it's been rumoured that those who have the Terminal Meridians constitution are actually exceptionally talented, but because they were limited by their Terminal Meridians constitution, it became a burden on them. Now that Lou Mu Yan eradicated her Terminal Meridians constitution, then her hidden excelling talent could be revealed. Our Imperial Academy can't let go of such a talent.\u201d The sackcloth old man lowered his head and whispered to Ruan Li.\u201d\u201cMm. I've reallocated Lou Mu Yan's resources. As long as she can successfully defeat Gu Yan Ran and obtain the Trial quota, she'll be rewarded with it together with the rest of her rewards.\u201d Ruan Li nodded in understanding. Not to mention Lou Mu Yan's excelling talent that she demonstrated today, just based on the fact that she had talent in Alchemy alone, she was worthy of them to raise her with all their heart.Meanwhile the colours on the faces of the Imperial Family changed dramatically. Yun Tian Chen rubbed his thumb ring with his fingers firmly. The talent and strength Lou Mu Yan demonstrated today exceeded their expectations. It seemed that after he returned, he must find the Imperial Teacher to discuss and reconsider the strategy of winning her over.\u201cGeneral Lou, it truly is 'with a father that's a tiger, the daughter cannot be a dog2'!\u201d An official beside Lou Mo Yu smiled and praised.Immediately after, the voices that praised Lou Mu Yan resounded incessantly, and Lou Mo Yu accepted them one by one with a calm smile.Everyone in the Lou Family had amazing talents. Before, there was a trash with a Terminal Meridians constitution that dragged the family down, but now that the trash suddenly had talent that's comparable to a genius, it truly was enviable.This time Lou Mu Yan and Gu Yan Ran's battle had little suspense. The foundation of the Lou Clan simply wasn't something a new clan like the Gu Clan, who relied on wealth to gain status as a distinguished family, could compare to.Yun Lan and the rest had seen Lou Mu Yan use drawing talismans in the void before, so the amazement in their heart wasn't as great as the others, but their burning gazes couldn't help but lock onto the purple-clothed woman on the battle platform.On the battle platform, Gu Yan Ran discovered that the yellow talisman incantation that carried thick Spiritual Force suppressed her dan'tian, so she couldn't convert Spiritual Force into Elemental Energy at all. Her heart constricted.Horror filled her eyes as she held the cyan longsword in her hand tightly, but she could no longer channel any trace of Elemental Energy into the sword.She looked up at Lou Mu Yan angrily and shouted: \u201cLou Mu Yan, what did you do to me? You're too dirty.\u201d\u201cIsn't the word 'dirty' written on your own face?\u201d Lou Mu Yan shrugged and said with a look of disgust: \u201cUgly people will do all kinds of strange things to gain attention3. Gu Yan Ran, your ability to put the blame on the victim is much stronger than your strength.\u201d\u201cGood! Good!\u201d Gu Yan Ran smiled in anger. She knew that this trash wouldn't dispel the talisman incantation in her body, and a sliver of coldness and viciousness flashed in her eyes as she stared at Lou Mu Yan like a venomous snake, \u201cLou Mu Yan, it's you who forced me.\u201dLou Mu Yan's eyes focused. She had felt that Gu Yan Ran would have a strong trump card. It seemed that this woman couldn't help but make a move now.Unsurprisingly, although Gu Yan Ran's dan'tian was blocked and she couldn't use Elemental Energy, but she channelled a trace of Mental Energy into the silver bangle on her wrist, \u201cCome out, Lightning Leopard.\u201dAs soon as Gu Yan Ran's words fell, a mighty leopard that was more than one metre long appeared on the battlefield. Its eyes swept the place coldly, and some with a low cultivation base couldn't help but shudder.\u201cA Tier 4 Lightning Leopard Demonic Beast. Gu Yan Ran actually has a Tier 4 Spirit Pet.\u201d Someone on the stands couldn't help but exclaim.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cThis time it'll be miserable for Lou Mu Yan. I thought she was going to win just now, but who knew Gu Yan Ran had held back a trick. Very good!\u201d\u201cYeah! I've said it before, Gu Yan Ran's more likely to win, looks like I'm right. Lou Mu Yan verses a Tier 4 Spirit Pet that's as powerful as a Sword Spirit, it's only a matter of time before she loses.\u201dThe voices of several people were filled with gloating and jealousy. Compared to Gu Yan Ran who had always been excellent, many of them felt unhappy that Lou Mu Yan became someone so bright, with a temperament and strength that they couldn't match, from a trash they always belittled. They all hoped Lou Mu Yan would lose.The distinguished guests saw Lou Zhan Tian's expression collapse, and Lou Mo Yu's brows furrowed. They also didn't think that Gu Yan Ran actually had such a trump card, and their hearts hovered.Yun Lan and the others also revealed a worried look. The Spirit Pet that Gu Yan Ran released wasn't only a Tier 4 Demonic Beast, but a Middle-Phase Tier 4 Demonic Beast, which was equivalent to the strength of a Middle-Phase Sword Spirit, not to mention even when a human and a Demonic Beast were on the same level, the Demonic Beast's defence was better than humans, so Lou Mu Yan would suffer a lot from the battle.According to the rules of the competition, a Spirit Pet was also a part of the student's combat power, and therefore was not restricted to use. Even if the Spirit Pet's power was stronger than the opponents by numerous levels, it wasn't breaking the rules.\u201cHAHA!\u201d Looking at the sudden turn of the battle, Yun Tian Zong laughed and said to Gu Yuan Kai beside him: \u201cOld Gu, your family's Yan Ran sure hid her abilities deeply! She actually has a Tier 4 Spirit Pet.\u201dAlthough there were Spirit Beast Masters who could tame Demonic Beasts and help Sword Masters contract Spirit Pets on Tian'ling Continent, but Spirit Beast Masters were too scarce, and if one wanted to ask them for help, the price to be paid was extremely high. As expected from the Gu Clan who was Yan'zhou Country's richest\u2014this amount of money wasn't something an average distinguished clan could afford.\u201cYou flatter me. Compared to Young Miss Lou, my family's Yan Ran is still far behind.\u201d Gu Yuan Kai smiled modestly, but with a sarcastic tone, and the triumph in his eyes wasn't hidden.So what if the Lou Clan was powerful? So what if Lou Mu Yan eradicated her Terminal Meridians constitution and was no longer trash? His eldest daughter could suppress the Empress in the palace, now his younger daughter could naturally ruin Lou Mu Yan.Yun Tian Zong sneered: \u201cTrue, Young Miss Lou is indeed amazing. I'll just see how she defeats that Tier 4 Spirit Pet. Don't be beaten up badly and end up ugly crying with tears and snot, then surrendering.\u201d\u201cShut your beak, you've got no right to talk about our family's Yan'er like that.\u201d Lou Mo Yu's elegant face carried a sense of coldness.The royal officials that sat nearby didn't expect Lou Mo Yu would directly snap back at the King of Zhen'xi and couldn't help but cast sympathetic glances at Yun Tian Zong.Lu Mo Yu was usually elegant and refined towards others, but if he was truly angered, he would be exceptionally frightening.\u201cLou Mo Yu, do you dare try to say that again?\u201d Yun Tian Zong had never liked Lou Mo Yu. It wasn't just that his prestige in the army was higher than himself, but his strength and combat power was also all above him. However, even if he was afraid of Lou Mo Yu right now, he still wouldn't want to lose face in front of everyone.\u201cShut up.\u201d Yun Tian Chen suddenly turned his head and glared at Yun Tian Zong. This younger brother of his truly was getting more and more arrogant. It truly was time to beat him down a little.\u201cHumph.\u201d Yun Tian Zong snorted coldly, but stopped speaking.The blue veins in his clenched hands were popping, and he swallowed his anger. Right now wasn't the time to fall out with Yun Tian Chen yet. When that plan succeeded, he would definitely crush Yun Tian Chen and Lou Mo Yu into pieces.Not only did Yun Tian Zong bear killing intent towards the two of them. Lou Mo Yu lowered his eyes and also hid his killing intent.1an idiom, but with an addition at the beginning. \u4e00\u9e23\u60ca\u4eba is the idiom, which means to amaze the world with a single feat. \u4e0d\u9e23\u5219\u5df2 is an addition to that at the beginning which means that one was normally very average in performance.2play on the idiom 'with a father that's a tiger, the son cannot be a dog'.

    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 54: The Most Simplistic and Crude\u00a0BattleOn the battle platform, because Gu Yan Ran's dan'tian was sealed, the wind Elemental Energy beneath her feet couldn't be replenished, so it soon vanished. She fell onto the corner of the battle platform, her eyes dyed with cruelty. She hugged her hands and gave orders to the Lightning Leopard to attack Lou Mu Yan.\u201cLightning Leopard, tear apart the face of the woman opposite and destroy her dan'tian for me.\u201d Gu Yan Ran's bitter voice sounded in the Lightning Leopard's Demonic Sea of Consciousness.The fact that the dan'tian in her body was sealed by Lou Mu Yan wasn't too worrying. She believed that once she returned to the Gu Clan and found an elder with a higher cultivation base than Lu Mu Yan, then she could expel the yellow talisman incantation.But she wouldn't let Lou Mu Yan off. She couldn't let this woman shine. She wanted the Lightning Leopard to completely destroy Lou Mu Yan's dan'tian and let her become trash again, so that even with the Marrow Cleansing Pill, it couldn't change anything.After hearing its owner's command, the Lightning Leopard's fur immediately stood on its end. It barred its teeth and growled at Lou Mu Yan.Lou Mu Yan's eyes not only didn't show fear, but faintly displayed some anticipation. It had been a long time since she had a good fight. In her previous life, she had obtained a set of Sky Rank body-refining manual that an almighty cultivator of the Immortal Cultivation World left behind describing how to refine the body like Demonic Beasts. Once the skill was successfully learnt, the hardness of one's body would rival a True Spirit cultivator1.After taking the Marrow Cleansing Pill to eradicate her Terminal Meridians constitution and start cultivating, she immediately began to re-cultivate that body-refining skill. Compared to long-range technique attacks, she actually preferred the most simplistic and crude ways of combat methods.With the experience of her previous life and her current exceptional talent, she quickly finished cultivating the first layer of the skill. The hardness of her body could now barely compete with a Tier 4 Demonic Beast. Now that there was a live target for her to practice her hands on, why not.[ROAR!!]The Tier 4 Lightning Leopard already bore intelligence. Looking at the human's roused battle intent, battle intent also slowly ignited in its eyes. It desired to vent its anger and hatred, for being forced by a Spirit Beast Master to contract a low-level human who was even weaker than itself, on her.Lou Mu Yan exercised her fists, and her crystal-clear, clever eyes were filled with brightness, \u201cCome on. Let me learn how powerful a Middle-Phase Tier 4 Demonic Beast is.\u201d[ROAR!!] Being belittled by a human was the greatest humiliation possible to him. The Lightning Leopard gathered all the pressure it could muster to supress the human, roared, kicked its hind legs, leapt up, and swung its sharp front claws towards Lou Mu Yan.Lou Mu Yan used her Flash Steps to manoeuvre around the Lightning Leopard's claws. No matter how those lightning-fast claws landed, they couldn't even touch half the corner of her clothes.[ROAR ROAR!!] The Lightning Leopard roared, and he utilised the power of its Demonic Energy, increasing its speed several times.The damned human actually had a speed that was no weaker than itself. It must tear her apart after catching her.Lou Mu Yan's eyes sharpened, and the wind attribute Elemental Energy surreptitiously gathered beneath her feet, instantly rising the speed of her Flash Steps, avoiding the Lightning Leopard's attacks with extreme speed.The people in the audience couldn't see the movements of the two at all, and could only see the phantoms that flashed on the ground or in the air from time to time.\u201cWhat? Lou Mu Yan can evade the attack of a Tier 4 Demonic Beast? Isn't this speed a bit too fast?\u201d The students on the stands were dumbfounded. To be able to use such a speed that wasn't inferior to a Demonic Beast with power comparable to the Sword Spirit Stage, was this really Lou Mu Yan?\u201cWhat sort of skill did she cultivate?\u201d A Sword King beside Ruan Li revealed a hint of burning desire.Ruan Li also had curiosity in his eyes, \u201cI don't know, but it should be a speed-based auxiliary skill. Probably given to her by that expert Master of hers.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksAside from the expert behind Lou Mu Yan, he couldn't think of how else she received this skill. After all, the Lou Clan had never used any skills that was speed-based in all these years.Mentioning the expert behind Lou Mu Yan, the rest of the people also came to understand. To be able to refine a miraculous pill like the Marrow Cleansing Pill, having a few high-level manuals on hand didn't seem unnatural. Originally there were some Sword Masters who had their thoughts on the manual with a burning desire to obtain it, but now felt as if someone poured cold water on them, and could only give up unwillingly.Lou Mu Yan, who was currently battling the Demonic Beast on the stage to her hearts content, didn't know that the 'Master' she had casually made up helped her reduce some trouble again. Otherwise there would've been many who desired her Flash Step manual.Emperor Yun Tian Chen found that it was harder and harder to see through Lou Mu Yan. How did the little woman that used to have no schemer's heart, and was pure to a point she was even somewhat ignorant, become so cunning and capable.Gu Yuan Kai had a stern look in his eyes. He didn't expect the result to be like this. Right now, he could only wait for the result. The Lou Clan already had one number one genius of the Empire, he sure didn't want to see the Lou Clan add another Sword Master with huge potential. No matter what, Lou Mu Yan couldn't be left alive.After the Lightning Leopard's claw attacks failed time and again, it was completely angered, raised its head, and roared again: [ROAR ROAR!!]Lou Mu Yan narrowed her eyes. The provocation only just started, yet it was angry already? Gu Yan Ran's Spirit Pet sure was the same as her, both inferior. It wasn't fun at all.Taking the moment the Lightning Leopard stopped to roar, she applied a layer of fire attribute Elemental Energy on her fist, tapped her toe, flew up, and initiated the attack against the Lightning Leopard.\u201cIs Lou Mu Yan crazy, she's not avoiding it, but actually started to attack it?\u201d Xiao Zi Ang exclaimed.Except, the moment his voice fell, and before the others could reply, all they saw was Lou Mu Yan having approached the Lightning Leopard with only a foot's distance between them, and directly slam her fist onto the left side of the Lightning Leopard's back.[BOOM!] Lou Mu Yan's punch that composed of a violent Elemental Energy fell on the Lightning Leopard's body just like that. Unprepared, it was blasted against a stone pillar on the battle platform, followed by a few echoes of destruction.The Lightning Leopard jumped up from the falling rock that buried it after the stone pillar shattered, and a strong fighting intent was aroused by Lou Mu Yan. It belittled this woman too much before, and now put away its contempt\u2014it would make her pay for the price of the attack she initiated.[ROAR!!] The Lightning Leopard roared again. As it leapt up, it used its body to slam towards Lou Mu Yan.Lou Mu Yan chuckled lightly, and the fighting intent in her eyes grew thicker and thicker. A Tier 4 Demonic Beast was indeed not to be underestimated. If it were a Sword Master that took on that punch, then they would probably already be severely injured.She was fearless, and even revealed excitement on her face. She clenched her fists and immediately went up to 'greet' it.Suddenly on the battle platform, all one saw was Lou Mu Yan punch time and again, with numerous fists landing on the Lightning Leopard's body. The Lightning Leopard wasn't idle either. While avoiding Lou Mu Yan's punch, it also wrapped its claws with Demonic Energy and directly faced the fists that made its skin feel as if it were burning.[BANG BANG!] As such, one person and one beast launched the most primitive and simplistic battle against each other\u2014a punch here, a claw there, another attack elsewhere.Lou Mu Yan flashed about in the air endlessly, dodging the Demonic Beast's claw attacks one by one. And every time she dodged, she would swing a fist with fiery energy onto the Lightning Leopard's body, specifically targeting the Lightning Leopard's weak spots, and every time she could knock it flying.What everyone simply saw now on the battle platform was a purple-clothed woman with peerless beauty and elegance, brutally and simplistically bombard the Tier 4 Lightning Leopard that was famous for its speed. The Lightning Leopard had even retracted its claws and used its entire body to withstand Lou Mu Yan's attacks, yet it was still in a disadvantageous position.Many people wondered if they were seeing things. Numerous creases formed on some people's foreheads as they furrowed their brows.\u00a0Lou Mu Yan, was it really good for you to be so violent like this\u20261If people still remember, this is a cultivation stage in her previous world. Basically super strong and many, many stages above her right now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Because of the sudden change in her state of mind, her temperament also changed drastically.Originally, her temperament was calm and indifferent like the wind and water, but now she exuded a kind of proudness and dignity that looked down upon the world. There was even a hint of wickedness in her expression, as if a red spider lily that had suddenly bloomed, demonic and gorgeous, seizing the brightness on the shores in the netherworld.\u201cCome on, Gu Yan Ran, let me see just how far you can go with the help of an external force.\u201d Lou Mu Yan raised her eyes and looked at Gu Yan Ran. Her eyes that were as bright as the stars carried with it a sharp brilliance.Gu Yan Ran naturally felt Lou Mu Yan's changes, and she actually had an odd feeling, that this sort of bold and uninhibited personality was actually something that Lou Mu Yan should own. She shook her head and put away the hallucinations in her mind\u2014today, she must have been provoked too deeply by this trash.People with who had some strength and a higher cultivation base in the crowd also keenly noticed the change in Lou Mu Yan's temperament, which formed a stark contract against Gu Yan Ran's softness and delicateness. This sort of dignified and bold temperament immediately pulled the distance between the two apart by numerous levels, and made one feel that the light purple figure was more and more dazzling.\u201cWind sword, go.\u201d Gu Yan Ran channelled a large amount of Elemental Energy into the longsword in her hand, and instantly gathered a whirlwind.With a wave of her hand, the whirlwind with a strong killing intent and pressure flung from her longsword, heading directly towards Lou Mu Yan.There was a time limit to Gu Yan Ran borrowing the external force, and she didn't want to talk more nonsense with Lou Mu Yan either, with all her focus on defeating the other party and destroyoing her dan'tian.Lou Mu Yan had long made preparations. Her current strength was only an Advanced-Stage Great Sword Master, so she couldn't be compared to Gu Yan Ran who suddenly rose an entire Stage, but she had a lot of tricks up her sleeves. It wasn't difficult to win.However, during this period of time, she had exposed a bit too many of her abilities, so she decided that she would only use her previously demonstrated fire attribute Elemental Energy, and her advantage in speed to battle. In this way, she could also have a good idea of the strength of a Sword Spirit.The Lightning Leopard that Gu Yan Ran released before had cultivation base, but didn't have the actual strength because it had lost its wildness and battle experience. As such, its actual strength could only be compared to an Initial-Phase Sword Spirit. Not to mention aside from its advantageous speed and the hardness of its body, it didn't really have any other outstanding abilities to note, that's why she could win so easily.While at this time, even though Gu Yan Ran borrowed an external force, but the strength she displayed was an actual Advanced-Stage Sword Spirit. It was precisely this sort of battle that was interesting.A fiery fighting spirit burst from Lou Mu Yan's eyes, she moved her feet, and in a flew flashes, she vanished from the battle platform. The strong sword aura condensed from the wind element landed on a pillar of the battle platform.[BOOM BOOM!!] The stone pillars instantly turned into countless broken stones, bursting open. Numerous lingering sword auras spread out and shot directly onto the protective barrier arranged by the referees.The protective barrier shook a few times before returning to normal and the two referees displayed gravity in their eyes. They looked at each other and continued to channel Elemental Energy into the barrier to strengthen its defensive ability.\u201cLou Mu Yan, if you have the guts, don't keep dodging.\u201d Gu Yan Ran's eyes revealed some redness, and her anger rose to her head.She owned the wind attribute Elemental Energy, so she originally had the advantage in speed, but now Lou Mu Yan, a cultivator with a fire attribute Elemental Energy, had the advantage. She truly despised it deeply.Lou Mu Yan didn't stop in her steps and sneered: \u201cSpeed's also a kind of strength. If you have the ability, we'll talk after you hit me.\u201d\u201cGo and die.\u201d Gu Yan Ran was completely overtaken by that powerful external force, and with a hot head, she suddenly had the thought of killing Lou Mu Yan right here.After she channelled the Elemental Energy into her longsword, she kept slashing towards the flashing shadows. Each sword aura storm exploded on the battle platform.The battle platform was almost half destroyed by the sword aura, but Lou Mu Yan's figure still remained flashing about, sometimes appearing, sometimes disappearing, which was breathtaking. This sort of auxiliary speed technique was really too powerful.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cAH! AH!\u201d Being unable to hit Lou Mu Yan, Gu Yan Ran screamed with blood-shot eyes, and her sound that carried wind Elemental Energy spread out and targeted the flashing shadow.Lou Mu Yan narrowed her eyes. She truly underestimated Gu Yan Ran. This woman did have some talent. Previously, she already created the prototype of a Sword Aura Array, and now she even used a sound attack, which could be regarded as a rather powerful ability. But it was a pity that she met her.After a pause, Lou Mu Yan stopped in mid-air, extended her hand, and instantly a fiery, blooming fire lotus leapt out from her palm.Gu Yan Ran also grew fiercer. She gathered all her Elemental Energy into her longsword desperately, \u201cLet's allow one move to determine the winner. Lou Mu Yan, you'll definitely lose.\u201dThe cyclone continued to rotate around her longsword, and her wind Elemental Energy gathered little by little to form a violent cyan cyclone. Gu Yan Ran swung her sword with all her strength and instantly, a cyan light flew out at impeccable speed.Lou Mu Yan also felt the strong force closing in on her. She turned her jade-like hands calmly, and countless enchanting, crimson fire lotuses floated out, working in collaboration with the first lotus and formed a huge crimson shield, made from fire lotuses, before her.[BANG BANG!!] The cyan cyclone instantly hit the giant fire lotus shield, and a huge explosion sounded in everyone's ears. Those with weaker cultivation bases felt their heart and lungs suffocate, and there was an urge to spurt blood.The cyan and red rays of light met in mid-air and the dazzling, piercing light brightened the sky.Seeing that the protective barrier actually started cracking, the referees hurriedly called the other two referees to increase the Elemental Energy and try to stabilise the protective barrier. Otherwise the sword aura and blazing hot fire element would inevitably negatively affect the students in the audience.The cyclone that was weakened by more than half by the giant fire lotus shield blasted directly onto Lou Mu Yan's body. Because its speed was too fast, she didn't dodge and allowed the sword aura to fall on her.Following, she was slammed back onto the battle platform by that force and stumbled back a few steps. Blood surged in her chest and a trace of blood trickled from the corner of her lips. Because she had used a thick, dense net of Elemental Energy to protect her heart meridians, her injury wasn't too serious.She still appeared apathetic as she suppressed the injury caused by the cyclone, and the corner of her lips curled up as they opened: \u201cBreak!\u201dPart of the energy of the giant fire lotus shield in the air was also offset by the cyan cyclone, but after Lou Mu Yan's voice fell, it instantly merged together and turned into a red light, shooting directly at Gu Yan Ran.Gu Yan Ran originally thought she would definitely win upon seeing Lou Mu Yan being injured by the cyclone, so she couldn't help but reveal a triumphant smile, but she was startled by the sudden red light that shot towards her.She immediately threw the green jade pendant around her neck out before her, channelled a portion of Elemental Energy, and the jade pendant instantly grew larger and protected her in front.She gave Lou Mu Yan a look of provocation\u2014this was a Spirit Treasure. The strength of the fire Elemental Energy condensation definitely couldn't break it.Except, one moment she was looking at Lou Mu Yan with provocation, but the next, her face completely paled when the red light penetrated the jade pendant and entered directly into her body. A heart-wrenching pain was transmitted to her brain.She couldn't help but kneel on the ground, her hands wrapped around the area where her dan'tian was, and her eyes filled with horror. Her dan'tian was actually shattered by that red light, and the Elemental Energy escaped like a deflated ball.She panicked, endured the pain, and began to absorb Spiritual Force from the outside, but when the Spiritual Force arrived at her dan'tian, it simply couldn't condense and convert into Elemental Energy, while the Elemental Energy stored in her body was gradually being lost.[PU!!] With Gu Yan Ran's dan'tian destroyed, plus her internal injury, she couldn't stop herself from spitting out a few mouthfuls of blood.She suddenly raised her head and glared at Lou Mu Yan, her voice filled with endless hatred: \u201cLou Mu Yan, you actually dared\u2014 you actually dared to destroy my dan'tian! Our Gu Clan won't let you go!\u201dLou Mu Yan stretched out her hand and wiped the trace of blood from the corner of her mouth, her eyes unwavering and didn't pay attention to the threat from Gu Yan Ran. This woman's brain was truly rusty. Right now her dan'tian was already ruined, and yet she still acted so arrogant.\u201cWhat, you're inferior to me now, so you want to compete using family backgrounds? Ha, you think our Lou Clan would be afraid?\u201d She curled her lips and smiled devilishly: \u201cGu Yan Ran, from now on, just enjoy the fun of being trash.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He couldn't resist, stood up, flew onto the battle platform, picked Gu Yan Ran up and checked her injuries.When he discovered that Gu Yan Ran's dan'tian was shattered irreparably, he looked at Lou Mu Yan with a vicious glare, \u201cYou cruel and noxious woman, you dared to destroy one's dan'tian during the grand competition. I want you to pay the price.\u201dHe was incredibly angered. Gu Yan Ran was her favourite and most pampered daughter, the most gifted child of their Gu Clan, and was the hope for the rise of the Gu Clan. He poured so much energy into raising his daughter, yet it was now all ruined by Lou Mu Yan. He wasn't reconciled!Gu Yuan Kai's thread of sensibility had been plucked. He raised his arm and a wind blade that carried the strength of a Sword King flew directly towards Lou Mu Yan's dan'tian.[CLANG!] The wind blade was unexpectedly blocked by a column of water that fell from the sky.An elegant figure then landed on the battle platform, and said with a cold voice: \u201cGu Yuan Kai, you dare to have such an attitude towards your juniors like this, then could I take this as provoking our Lou Clan?\u201dLou Mo Yu stood in front of Lou Mu Yan. His elegant and handsome face revealed coldness, while there was killing intent hidden in his eyes.When Gu Yuan Kai saw Lou Mo Yu stand in front of Lou Mu Yan, an obscure flash of light passed by the depths of his eyes. According to his usual temperament he used to disguise himself, he would never be this impulsive. Just now, it was because he was stimulated by the fact that his daughter's dan'tian had been destroyed.He tried his best to calm himself down, but he really couldn't swallow the anger, \u201cThen did the Lou Clan have the right to ruin others' dan'tian so uninhibitedly? Such viciousness, this one, Gu, sure has been taught something.\u201dThen Gu Yuan Kai raised his head to look at the seats of the superiors and continued indignantly: \u201cPrincipal, a student like Lou Mu Yan who disregarded the rules and destroyed one's dan'tian and foundation should be expelled.\u201dHis daughter was trash and could no longer obtain a spot in the Trials, but he wouldn't let Lou Mu Yan obtain it either.Ruan Li didn't expect that Gu Yuan Kiai would link this issue to the rules of the grand competition. His eyebrows knitted together tightly, and he fell into deep thought.He naturally didn't want to touch Lou Mu Yan, but what she did today was indeed a bit too much. She destroyed Gu Yan Ran's dan'tian in public. If it was outside of the Academy, then it wasn't an issue, but since it occurred inside the Academy, he feared that it would attract backlash from other students of the Academy.However, he was more inclined to protect Lou Mu Yan. Even without comparing the value of the two students within this Academy, simply based on the fact that between Gu Yan Ran's temperament that pretended to be pure on the outside but was in fact vicious on the inside, or Lou Mu Yan's type of ruthlessness, he preferred the latter.Lou Mu Yan discovered that the Gu Clan's most scheming person was definitely this smiling tiger1, Gu Yuan Kai, who deliberately attempted to describe her as cruel and ruthless to strip her of her spot in the Trial. But he should ask whether she agreed or not.\u201cThe rules of the grand competition only said that you couldn't harm the other's life but didn't say that you couldn't ruin a person's dan'tian.\u201dLou Mu Yan sneered indolently: \u201cBesides, Gu Yan Ran wanted to kill me first, no? Does Patriarch Gu think that all the people present at this scene are dead? If it were me whose dan'tian was destroyed, then would you still come out and fight like this?\u201dBefore Gu Yuan Kai could refute, Lou Mo Yu said with a cold expression: \u201cI think everyone could clearly see the situation earlier during the battle. After Gu Yan Ran let out her Lightning Leopard, every time it attacked, it constantly targeted Yan'er's face and dan'tian. You could tell just who was more vicious with a little bit of thought.\u201cAfter the defeat, Gu Yan Ran even used the support of an external force to increase her strength, and her last attack also attempted to disable Yan'er. If it weren't that Yan'er had enough strength to protect herself, then the person who'd be lying on the ground right now with a destroyed dan'tian would've swapped around.\u201d Lou Mo Yu suppressed the killing intent in his eyes and returned to his usual elegant and handsome demeanour.After hearing he words of the Lou father and daughter, many people also began to recall the situation during the previous battle.From the beginning to the end, Gu Yan Ran was indeed the first to be ruthless, but it was just that she didn't succeed. If it were them, they also wouldn't let go of someone who wholeheartedly wanted to destroy their dan'tian.At this time, most people also awoke from the lure in Gu Yuan Kai's words\u2014they were almost confused by them. It was a natural rule of this world to get revenge on someone who had wronged them. If one allowed another to ride on top of them like horses and urinate on their heads2, then they were a wuss.Many people who felt Lou Mu Yan was vicious now re-examined the situation again and discovered that Gu Yan Ran was indeed suffering from her own actions. Of course, Lou Mu Yan was indeed cruel, but this cruelty was built on top of the principle of dealing with one as they did, or wanted to do, to them.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksAfter listening to her father's words, Lou Mu Yan chuckled softly, then looked at Ruan Li and said: \u201cPrincipal, it was Gu Yan Ran who first desired to destroy my dan'tian, so my hand slipped and accidentally destroyed her dan'tian. This should be considered self-defence, right? Not to mention, isn't it considered breaking the rules when she forcibly increased her own strength with the help of the Spirit Treasure around her neck? I strongly request the Academy to expel her.\u201dThe corner of Ruan Li's eye twitched. Her hand slipped? This girl sure wasn't embarrassed to say such things.It was obviously deliberate when she sealed Gu Yan Ran's dan'tian with a Void Talisman before. If he didn't guess wrong, if the Void Talisman wasn't broken by that energy, then after two hours, it would completely integrate into Gu Yan Ran's dan'tian and Gu Yan Ran would still become trash.Astonishment flashed by Gu Yuan Kai's eyes\u2014Lou Mu Yan could actually discover the Spirit Treasure that his daughter carried. She truly couldn't be left alive.In fact, many people didn't know how Gu Yan Ran suddenly increased her strength. After hearing Lou Mu Yan's words, they couldn't help booing.It was simply too despicable to use a Spirit Treasure to increase one's cultivation base when participating in the Grand Competition. There was simply no fairness in it at all and it was indeed breaking the rules. Who would've expected that Gu Yan Ran, who usually displayed gentleness and tenderness, would be this unbearable.\u201cLou Mu Yan, you're slandering me.\u201d Gu Yan Ran's dan'tian was all stirred up and in pain, but when she heard Lou Mu Yan bite back, she couldn't help but berate her.Lou Mu Yan glanced at her nonchalantly, then looked away with disgust as if having seen something dirty.She raised her head and looked at Ruan Li firmly and said: \u201cPrincipal, since Gu Yan Ran had broken the rules, then everyone must see how she's held accountable, right? Otherwise, if during future Grand Competitions, other students also followed suit and borrowed external Elemental Energy to raise their cultivation base to battle, then wouldn't the Grand Competition become a competition between how solid the foundations of a distinguished clan were, and whose clan was richer?\u201dHearing Lou Mu Yan's words, many students from ordinary backgrounds showed indignant expressions, and displayed a bit of detest towards Gu Yan Ran.\u201cThe rules of the Academy's Grand Competition didn't include the rule of punishing a person who destroyed another's dan'tian. Lou Mu Yan's behaviour was indeed too much, but it was not against the rules.\u201dAfter some deep consideration, Ruan Li made a decision, and his face revealed gravity, \u201cGu Yan Ran using a Tier 4 Spirit Pet wasn't against the rules either, but using the power of a Spirit Treasure to forcefully advance their cultivation base and strength to battle is indeed a violation of the Academy rules.\u201dHis gaze swept over the father and daughter pair from the Gu Clan and continued: \u201cSince Gu Yan Ran's dan'tian was accidentally destroyed by Lou Mu Yan, the Academy won't punish her further. You may go home yourself and recuperate.\u201dThe meaning of going home to recuperate was obvious\u2014she needn't come back to the Imperial Academy in the future. Not saying it clearly was considered giving Gu Clan a way out of this awkward situation.Ruan Li's words sounded pertinent, but people could still discover that he was partial towards Lou Mu Yan. However, with some thought, it was also understandable\u2014one who had been raised by them was now a trash, and one who used to be trash was now a prodigy. Whoever was less important or more important could easily be chosen by anyone who understood the situation.\u201cPU!\u201d Gu Yan Ran's fury reached her heart when she heard Ruan Li's words, not to mention the injury on her dan'tian was severe, so she couldn't stop herself from spitting out blood and fainting.What made the entire world even darker was her last look at Chi Yi Xuan before closing her eyes.That man stared at Lou Mu Yan with scorching eyes of desire, so fervent that it was so obvious and vivid, while he turned a blind eye to her injuries. This was the man she had loved for many years.The coldness in her heart accompanied by the blow of having been turned to trash made Gu Yan Ran unable to hold on any longer, and she completely lost consciousness. She only hoped that after waking up, everything that happened today was just a dream.1tigers are dangerous, and a smiling tiger described someone that lures one into a false sense of security and safety, but was actually a dangerous or scheming person2of course, it is figurative. Simply meaning if one allowed others to do whatever they wanted to them, they were a wuss and weak.Random Note: HAHA yes. Yes, her hand slipped indeed.Random Note 2: Went to watch Shang Chi last night now that lockdown's over. It was wonderful representation with proper Chinese mythical creatures explored and the action was great! It was honestly what Mulan live action could've been \u2013 Mulan live action was honestly a disappointment. But Shang Chi did everything right.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 58: Obtained a Place in the\u00a0TrialsGu Yuan Kai found that his daughter in his arms had completely fainted, and his face couldn't be any darker.\u201cGood! I have truly experienced the Lou Clan's ability to reverse black and white. As expected of a person who comes from the mansion of one who aided in founding this dynasty1.\u201d Gu Yuan Kai sneered coldly.Lou Mo Yu glanced at him and said with a faint smile: \u201cEveryone has an innate sense of what is fair and just. Whoever is right or wrong isn't something that could be forced to become truth simply based on one's words. I suggest that Patriarch Gu take Young Miss Gu to seek medical care as quickly as possible. Your daughter had been hurt so badly like this and yet you still have the time to talk so glibly. This one, Lou, truly\u00a0admires\u00a0Patriarch Gu very much.\u201d\u201cYour Lou Clan is truly pushing one too hard. Our Gu Clan won't leave this issue as it is.\u201d Gu Yuan Kai didn't bother hiding his true character right now either. The Lou Clan already stepped on his baseline. After he returned this time, he must plan well on how to peel a layer of skin off from the Lou Clan.As for Lou Mu Yan, she was just a person that was bound to die. He sure wanted to see how Lou Mo Yu and the others' faces changes when that time arrives.He suppressed the strong killing intent against the Lou father and daughter, carried the unconscious Gu Yan Ran and quickly headed towards the gate of the battle grounds.Although Gu Yan Ran's dan'tian had been destroyed, but he still had a sliver of hope that, perhaps by some sort of luck, their clan's Ancestor could have some way to remedy it.Of course, he noted down this hatred towards the Lou Clan for ruining his daughter, and in turn, also began to hate the Imperial Academy.After Gu Yuan Kai walked out the gate of the Academy and got into the carriage, his usual kind, round face instantly became grim, and a green light that didn't belong to any normal person flashed in his eyes.Once the plan was implemented, he would absolutely destroy the Lou Clan and the Imperial Academy, and drive Lou Mu Yan and her father to the eighteenth layer of hell2.As soon as the Gu father and daughter left, Ruan Li gave Lan Si a surreptitious look, then sat there as if a calm and composed old monk drinking tea, not saying anymore.After receiving that indicative look, Lan Si's lips curled into a very shallow arc. He didn't expect that little girl, Lou Mu Yan, to have this sort of ability. How very interesting.\u201cI announce that Lou Mu Yan won the final competition and won the only place for the Trials of the freshman Earth Class.\u201d Lan Si cleared his throat and announced to the audience.[WOW!]As soon as his voice fell, the audience burst with fervour.Lou Mu Yan, the Academy's number one trash, really defeated her opponent in the Earth Class and won first place, as well as a place in the Trials. Many people still felt as if they were dreaming as it was simply unreal.\u201cThis Lou Mu Yan's simply too abnormal. With the cultivation base of an Advanced-Phase Great Sword Master, she not only defeated a Tier 4 Spirit Pet, but also defeated Gu Yan Ran, who had advanced her cultivation base to Advanced-Phase Sword Spirit Stage. It's unbelievable!\u201d\u201cBut since she forcibly advanced her cultivation base, her strength isn't as powerful as an actual Advanced-Phase Sword Spirit expert, so Gu Yan Ran's actual strength is only Middle-Phase Sword Spirit.\u201d Someone said, unconvinced.The people next to him knew that he was speaking the truth, but there were also some people who disagreed, \u201cBut that's still a fight that crossed levels. To be able to battle a Sword Spirit as a Great Sword Master and come out victorious, I'm truly convinced by Lou Mu Yan.\u201d\u201cI'm also convinced.\u201d Echoes of agreement resounded.This was precisely the world where strength was respected. In front of strength, everything else was futile. Only with strength could one obtain respect. At this time, even those who were dissatisfied of, jealous of, envious of, or hated Lou Mu Yan wouldn't display their disagreement of her either.On the seats of the distinguished guests, Xiao Zi Ang's mouth had dropped wide open, and it took him a while to come to his senses. He slapped Lou Mu Ting on the back again and said with an excited, overstimulated voice: \u201cMu Ting, your younger sister is simply too fierce. I was truly pecked in the eyes by an eagle in the past3.\u201d\u201cThat's only a matter of course. Can't you see whose little sister she is.\u201d Lou Mu Ting turned his head with a face of pride and smugness\u2014it looked as if it begged for a beating.Xiao Zi Ang clicked his tongue, then turned his head away, wishing he didn't know this siscon idiot.Yun Lan looked at the purple figure on the battle platform with a profound look, and a ripple rose in his heart.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksChi Yi Xuan's deep gaze had Lou Mu Yan reflected in his eyes. If one looked carefully, one could capture that in the depths of his eyes there was an additional determined desire.Lou Mu Yan calmly accepted the only Trial place in the Earth Class. Her facing things with calmness regardless of honour or disgrace made many superiors of the Empire think highly of her and thought that it was as expected of one from the Lou Clan\u2014her manner was truly extraordinary.Of course, because of Lou Mu Yan's unbelievable performance today, there were more people who desired the Marrow Cleansing Pill.Ruan Li, Yun Tian Chen and the others all had their own plans, but they were all optimistic about Lou Mu Yan's rise.After the Grand Competition, Lou Mu Yan didn't remain at the Academy, but instead returned to the General's Mansion with her family.As soon as she got home, Lou Zhan Tian ordered the servants to prepare dinner and celebrate together.\u201cYan'er, you could rightfully feel proud and elated today. You really earned face for your big brother.\u201d Lou Mu Ting squeezed in to sit beside Lou Mu Yan, saying with a face of smiles.Lou Mu Yan rolled her eyes at him with amusement, \u201cSmug!\u201d\u201cHaha, being smug is only natural. Yan'er's performance today truly opened our eyes. Who knew that, although the time you spent cultivating wasn't long, but you could already condense your fire Elemental Energy.\u201d Lou Zhan Tian was extremely excited.\u201cThat's right, little sister's talent's not at all inferior to mine, and perhaps is even better.\u201d Lou Mu Bai's indifferent expression had long been replaced by softness and was proud of his younger sister from the bottom of his heart.Lou Mo Yu's eyes were also full of smiles, \u201cToday's indeed worth celebrating.\u201dAfter the family finished their dinner in a warm atmosphere, Lou Mu Yan called them to the conference hall, took out four jade slips from her interspatial ring that she had written from memory and handed it to them one by one.Today she discovered that the aura of the Gu father and daughter weren't right. The Gu Clan definitely wasn't simple and was instead a venomous snake that hid in the dark. She must improve the Lou Clan's overall strength, at least to be able to protect themselves.Lou Zhan Tian took the jade slip curiously and placed it on his forehead to read, but the more he read, the more shocked he became. After finishing the last page, his expression of shock was to a degree that he had never displayed before, \u201cYan'er, where did you get this sword skill from?\u201dThis was a solid Sky Rank sword skill that had practically never appeared in Yan'zhou Country before. Even in the entire Tian'ling Continent, only those Super Distinguished Clans or Sects could possibly own one as their most valuable collection.Lou Mu Yan rubbed the ice bangle on her wrist that Ming Xiu gifted her, then raised her eyes with a smile and said: \u201cI believe that you've all already heard from eldest brother. The last time I was injured by Gu Yan Ran and fell unconscious, I dreamt that I'd gone to another world.\u201d\u201cYes, we've indeed heard of it.\u201d\u201cIt felt as if I had experienced thousands of years and learnt many things4. Amongst them, I also remembered a lot of manuals and sword skills. These four Sky Rank sword skills was precisely something I obtained from that world.\u201d\u201cWhat? Sky Rank sword skill?\u201d Lou Mu Ting had wondered what the jade slip contained when his grandpa's expression changed. Now that he heard the two talk about Sky Rank sword skills, he placed the copy in his hand on his forehead in disbelief.Lou Mu Bai and Lou Mo Yu also did the same thing, and after a while, they also displayed expressions that were practically the same as grandfather.The sword skills in the jade slips weren't only Sky Rank, but were also exceptionally suitable for their cultivation attributes. Coordinated with their current manuals, it was practically like a tiger with added wings5.1basically another way of him sarcastically saying 'as expected from the Lou Clan'. The first part between Gu Yaun Kai and Lu Mo Yu is full of sarcasm hahaha2Chinese mythology, hell has 18 layers, and the 18th\u00a0layer is the lowest depths of hell, and the worst.3figuratively means he used to be blind to not have seen how amazing Lou Mu Yan was. (side note: Xiao Zi Ang's pretty funny hahaha)4O.o I just randomly realised, she was probably thousands of years old when she died in her previous life and it probably wasn't an exaggeration when she says she experienced 'thousands of years'\u2026 Why did I only realise how old she was now? After my umpteenth time reading this? I can't remember if the novel ever clarified it. I mean it makes sense if she was. HAHA How old was Ming Xiu again\u2026? I can't really remember. No matter, love knows no age (with exceptions, of course, I do NOT condone certain acts done under the pretence of 'love').5a tiger is already very strong and dominated the land, so a tiger that had grown wings would be even stronger as it could conquer the sky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 59: Become\u00a0Partners\u201cWho knew that Yan'er would have such a fortuitous encounter.\u201d Lou Mo Yu lowered the jade slip from his forehead and held it in his palm as he smiled and continued to say: \u201cNo wonder the Divine Seer would foretell that you would be reborn after experiencing a life-or-death calamity, obtain a great opportunity, and even embark on the path of the strong because of it.\u201d\u201cNot only that, from this incident, Yan'er not only gained a lot herself, but even the Lou Clan benefited by association. The Lou Clan's combat power will rise to an even higher level.\u201d Lou Zhan Tian added.\u201cI'm going to study the sword skill now.\u201d After reading the contents of the jade slip, Lou Mu Ting stood up with a look of comprehension, then hurriedly left the hall, returning to his room to cultivate.Lou Zhan Tian and the others' eyes also revealed a dash of eagerness. The people of the Lou Clan were diligent in cultivating with extraordinary talents. After seeing such a sword skill in front of them, if they didn't immediately go study it, they'd feel restless.Lou Mu Yan smiled, then took out some more jade slips she had prepared and handed them to Lou Zhan Tian, \u201cGrandpa, take these Earth Rank manuals and see who in the Lou Clan are suitable to raise, then give it to them.\u201dThe excitement and joy on Lou Zhan Tian's face couldn't be supressed. He took the jade slips, read them all, then laughed aloud a few times: \u201cGood!\u201dIt was also time for the Lou Clan to train a group of high-level Sword Masters as their trump cards in battle.\u201cGrandpa, father, eldest brother, you guys can go to your rooms to study it now.\u201d Lou Mu Yan saw how the usually calm and composed three were unable to sit still, so she said with a smile.In her hands, those Sky Rank sword skills weren't considered high-level at all. She even had Saint Rank and Deity Rank ones, except cultivation should be gradual and orderly. With the cultivation base of the four people, more advanced swords skills or manuals weren't appropriate.\u201cAlright!\u201d The three nodded in unison.Lou Mu Yan stared at the backs of the three that were leaving and her eyes were dyed with warmth. She would definitely make the Lou Clan stronger and stronger. She must protect the family she cherished.After returning to her room, she saw that the little white beast was on her bed absorbing the Spiritual Force of Heaven and earth and refining it. Slight surprise crossed her eyes.Such an absorption speed was even faster than her by a lot. This Spirit Devourer that titled himself as 'This King' was indeed from an extraordinary origin.She walked to the table opposite the bed and sat down, took out the Spiritual Tea she received from Shopkeeper Lu that was in her interspatial ring and brewed a pot.Together with Lou Mu Yan's temaking movements that flowed smoothly like the clouds and water, a scent of aromatic tea permeated the entire room.The Spirit Devourer, that initially had both eyes closed, opened them, glanced at the woman who was drinking tea from her cup and telepathically said with coldness in his voice, \u201cLet's talk.\u201dThe corners of Lou Mu Yan's lips raised slightly in an arc. She lifted her eyes and asked, \u201cYou've thought it through?\u201d\u201cWhat does it matter if I have or haven't thought it through? Did I have any other options?\u201dA self-deprecating voice sounded in Lou Mu Yan's Sea of Consciousness, and even the way he referred to himself changed from 'This King' to 'I'. It seemed that he had come to understand his current unfortunate circumstances.Lou Mu Yan nodded in approval: \u201cYou indeed had no other choice.\u201d\u201cJust what do you want?\u201d\u201cCan I ask you a few questions first?\u201d Lou Mu Yan asked instead and avoided answering.The little white beast revealed a cold look in his eyes that didn't match his appearance. After a moment of silence, he replied, \u201cAsk.\u201d\u201cWhat's your name.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cMo Yan.\u201d\u201cYou're from another continent?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAn upper interface? Or a continent on the same interface?\u201d\u201cWith your current strength, you're not qualified to know this.\u201dLou Mu Yan pursed her lips, but didn't mind, and continued to ask: \u201cYou were once really powerful? I must've picked up a treasure when I took you home after winning you.\u201dMo Yan glanced at Lou Mu Yan lightly and didn't refute. He used to dominate a portion of the Demonic Realm, so naturally he was quite powerful. As for picking up a treasure, that was only a matter of course.Lou Mu Yan chuckled upon seeing his look that evidently said, 'that's only for granted'. Maybe this Demonic Beast wasn't as cold and distant as she thought, \u201cI've finished asking my questions. Let's talk about cooperation now.\u201dMo Yan's eyes were cold, but there were also some hidden emotions, \u201cSpeak.\u201d\u201cI won't think of you as a Spirit Pet that I'll order around. I feel that we can become partners. At least we have the same goal, which is to keep growing stronger.\u201d After asking those questions, she felt as if she had somewhat understood Mo Yan, and it gave birth to a feeling of connection due to their similar circumstances.They were both once almighty people who stood above the clouds, yet now they were reduced to the weak at the lowest end of the food chain. They both had the heart to become stronger and was unwilling to remain as they were. That was why she had so much patience towards Mo Yan.The calm in Mo Yan's eyes wavered and his cold heart trembled\u2014partner? Could he believe it again?As he met Lou Mu Yan's firm and sincere eyes, Mo Yan suddenly had the urge to try. At the very least, he wouldn't be losing anything, right?\u201cAlright. I'll cooperate with you. But you also need to help me find some Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Items that can help me restore my strength.\u201d As long as he had those things, he would soon be able to restore a part of his strength.Lou Mu Yan nodded and asked: \u201cIs it difficult for you to regain your strength?\u201d It wasn't easy for her to regain the strength of her previous life. Aside from the experience, and the manuals in her Sea of Consciousness she could use, she had to do everything else from scratch.\u201cIt wasn't difficult to cultivate again, after all, the experience was all there. But the Spiritual Force of this interface was relatively thin, so it's difficult to find some Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Items, and it may waste a lot of time.\u201d Mo Yan's eyes were dyed with a cold pride and self-confidence.\u201cWhat we cultivators lacked most definitely wasn't time. For Demonic Beasts like you with a long lifespan, it only feels like the time it took to snap a finger.\u201d Lou Mu Yan remembered how eager she was to improve in strength, and laughed in ridicule at herself, \u201cBut for us now, time's indeed precious.\u201dMo Yan found that he couldn't understand this woman more and more. Why did a fifteen or sixteen-year-old girl give people a sense of maturity as if having gone through the numerous vicissitudes of life? The steadfast heart of the strong that she possessed also startled him, and an inexplicable sense of sympathy rose in him.\u201cYou're right.\u201d Mo Yan nodded in agreement. Precisely because he desperately wanted to restore his strength, he kept cultivating at every breath.\u201cWhat Spiritual Herbs or Spiritual Items do you need? Give me a list.\u201d Mo Yan's improvement in strength was also beneficial for her, so she hoped to find the things he required to restore his strength as quickly as possible.The guardedness in Mo Yan's eyes faded a lot. Since he decided to cooperate, then might as well believe one more time. He hoped that this human wouldn't disappoint him.He used his Demonic Sense to telepathically transmit to Lou Mu Yan the several kinds of Spiritual Herbs that he needed right now, \u201cAlthough I used my secret skill to be reborn, but I still have to start over. The current most urgent thing is to re-establish my yao'fu. Spiritual Items weren't required right now, but I hope you can help me find Frozen Mist Grass which I'll use to advance the level of my yao'fu.\u201dEvery Demonic Beast with a Demonic Sense and bore wisdom would experience the process of establishing a yao'fu. The higher the level of the yao'fu, the better the talent in cultivation in the future, and the speed of cultivation would also be much faster. The level of the yao'fu also determined the quality of the Demonic Core they would form in the future, so it was exceptionally important for a Demonic Beast.\u201cFrozen Mist Grass.\u201d Lou Mu Yan muttered. She took a sip of tea from her cup and agreed readily, \u201cNo problem.\u201dThe Deep Orchid she was looking for and the Frozen Mist Grass both grew in the Glacial Mountain Range. It just so happened she needed to find the Deep Orchid, so why wouldn't she help with something that was just on the way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter two days, Lou Mu Yan followed Lou Mu Bai back to the Imperial Academy.In the most ancient hall of the Academy, Principal Ruan Li and several other instructors were already seated. Opposite them were nine students.\u201cMu Bai, Mu Yan, you've both come. Sit.\u201d Ruan Li said with a gentle smile on his face and gestured for them to take a seat.After the two sat down, Ruan Li sat properly upright and looked at the eleven people seriously, addressing them: \u201cBringing you all here today is so that we can discuss the situation with the Trial this time.\u201d\u201cThe Trial after this Grand Competition is something different from what occurs after the Grand Competition in previous years and was exceptionally important.\u201d Ruan Li emphasised.\u201cYou should all know that Yan'zhou Kingdom isn't the only kingdom on Tian'ling Continent. There are also thousands, even tens of thousands of large and small kingdoms. But aside from these kingdoms, there are also Super Distinguished Clans and Sects that control and distribute the resources on this Continent.\u201cThe most powerful entities on this Continent are the Six Great Sects. The Ten Distinguished Spirit Sword Clans of the Eastern Region is in fact only at the very bottom of the Continent's Distinguished Clans.\u201d[GASP!] The eleven people present could all be regarded as those favoured by the Heavens, but after hearing this news, some still couldn't help but be stumped for words.\u201cThe Eastern Region ranks last among the Four Major Regions in terms of overall strength, so our Yan'zhou Kingdom is an extremely unremarkable existence on Tian'ling Continent.\u201dRuan Li paused, then spoke with gravity, \u201cAnd although you're all the most outstanding figures amongst the younger generation of Yan'zhou Kingdom, and could be regarded as the Empire's geniuses amongst this generation, but compared to the similar-aged Sword Masters of other larger countries, you guys don't count for much, and in fact, is also at the very bottom.\u201cIt's not to say that your natural endowments are worser than them, but you fall short on the resources that you're provided with compared to theirs by a great amount. That's why I hope you guys are fair to yourselves and not be disheartened. You'll only be able to improve if you attempt to pursue those that are stronger than yourselves.\u201d There was encouragement in Rian Li's eyes.\u201cPrincipal, you explaining all these things about the Continent to us, is there any special meaning to it?\u201d A young man of around twenty amongst the eleven students asked with confusion and worry.\u201cEvery twenty years there'll be a Continental Tournament for Hegemony1, and next year was precisely the beginning of the new round of the Tournament for Hegemony. All the countries in the Four Major Regions are given quotas, and our Yan'zhou Kingdom also received six places.\u201dSeeing the various expressions amongst the eleven people, with some even secretly hiding some worry, Ruan Li continued: \u201cThese six places were the total number of places given to Yan'zhou Kingdom and isn't to be chosen amongst only you guys. The pupils of the Imperial Family and Yan'zhou Kingdom's other Distinguished Clans will also participate in the Trial this time, and the six people participating in the Continental Tournament for Hegemony will be chosen amongst all of you.\u201d\u201cThen doesn't that mean we all have a chance, but vice versa, it was also possible none of us will be chosen?\u201d Another young woman asked anxiously.She was the winner of the senior student competition of the Earth Class, but her strength was already relatively weaker than the rest. If they had to compete with the Imperial Family to obtain a spot, then there was very little hope.\u201cThat's only natural. The Trial this time is basically an indirect selection trial. You must all take this seriously and cherish this opportunity.\u201dHe didn't want to give a complete blow to the students' confidence, so added, comforting: \u201cEach one of you has a chance. Don't be discouraged. It isn't impossible for you to have a fortuitous encounter during the Trial and soar high into the sky2.\u201dAfter hearing Ruan Li's words, the students' eyes that were dim from being disheartened, lit up. That's right, they already rose above others during the Grand Competition, who knew who'd win one of the six places in the future.On the other hand, Lou Mu Yan and Lou Mu Bai didn't reveal much emotion. Their eyes remained indifferent throughout which made the superiors of the Academy think highly of them again.Chi Yi Xuan's expression was also rather calm, and the ripples in his eyes had been concealed. Amongst the eleven people, he was also one of the students that Ruan Li and the other superiors were very optimistic about.\u201cPrincipal, are there any benefits in participating in the Trial and obtaining a place in the Continental Tournament for Hegemony?\u201d A Heaven Class student named Fu Chen, whose strength was second to Lou Mu Bai, asked.\u201cThe result of the Continental Tournament for Hegemony directly affected the allocation of the Continent's resources in the future twenty years. If you could advance to the top one hundred, then Yan'zhou Kingdom would be allocated even more resources.\u201d Ruan Li didn't conceal anything and continued to say: \u201cIf you receive a good result, the Empire will also gift you generous rewards.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksSeeing the student's bright eyes, he added with a smile: \u201cHowever, the most precious aspect for the players of the Continental Tournament for Hegemony aren't the rewards from the Empire, but instead, the chance to join Tian'ling Continent's Six Great Sects\u2014that was the most tempting.\u201d\u201cWhat? We can actually join the Six Great Sects.\u201d\u00a0 Among the eleven people, a person with a rather deep, solid background, Ji Han Xu, couldn't help but exclaim.In his Clan's Secret Manual, there were more or less some records on the structure of Tian'ling Continent, and within, there were records of the most superior forces, the Six Great Sects. Even if one had excelling natural endowments, wanting to join the Sects were as hard as ascending to the Heavens. Who knew that the Grand Competition this time was actually linked to the Six Great Sects.\u201cThe Six Great Sects' origins flows back long into the distant past, and their foundation and background was something that other distinguished clans and empires can't compare to. All the disciples beneath them have extraordinary talents.\u201cMeanwhile the Continental Tournament for Hegemony was precisely one of their ways of gathering excelling disciples. After all, to be able to excel and distinguish oneself in the top one hundred, above the tens of thousands of talented Seeded Players, they were definitely worthy of raising.\u201d Yuan Li stroked his beard as he explained. Everyone desired that their own kingdom's Seeded Players could enter into the top hundred and receive the Welcome Token from the Six Great Sects.Lou Mu Yan caught onto the yearning in Ruan Li's eyes, then raised an eyebrow and asked: \u201cPrincipal, then within all the previous Continental Tournament for Hegemonies, did our Yan'zhou Kingdom have any Seeded Players enter into the top one hundred?\u201dRuan Li didn't think that Lou Mu Yan would ask such an incisive question, was fazed for a moment, then smiled in embarrassment: \u201cNone.\u201dShe guessed that was how it was, paused, then asked: \u201cThen the best result is?\u201d[Cough cough\u2026] Seeing that everyone was staring at him, Ruan Li coughed dryly, \u201cThe best result is at two-thousand-one-hundred.\u201dIsn't the Principal just cheating people\u2014the best result was only at two-thousand-one-hundred, then how much of a chance did they have to advance to the top one hundred.However, Lou Mu Yan's eyes revealed fiery flames. The more challenging something was, the more interesting it was, and the more interested she was in it. Her lips rose and said domineeringly and confidently: \u201cThe individual's effort is the decisive factor, humans will definitely triumph over the Heavens3. Let's create a legend of Yan'zhou Kingdom!\u201d\u201cGood! Ambitious.\u201d Hearing Lou Mu Yan's passionate words, Ruan Li couldn't resist slamming his palm down on the table, \u201cYou should all participate in the Selection Trial with such an attitude. I hope that in the Continental Tournament of Hegemony this time, there'll be someone amongst you guys who'll successfully obtain the Welcome Token from one of the Six Great Sects.\u201dExcept for Lou Mu Bai and Chi Yi Xuan, the other's foreheads were filled with deep creases as they furrowed their brows.Wasn't Lou Mu Yan a bit too arrogant\u2014as the winner of the\u00a0freshman Earth Class, she couldn't even compare to them, so how could she create Yan'zhou Kingdom's legend? Was it really fine for the Principal to be agreeing so blindly?But it was undeniable that, after hearing Lou Mu Yan's words, a passionate desire and motivation couldn't help but rise in their hearts, and they began to look forward to the upcoming Selection Trial.Chi Yi Xuan looked deeply at Lou Mu Yan that glowed with pride and vigour. Right now, there was some sort of charm that exuded from her which constantly made people inadvertently convinced. That sort of domineering, unbridled, and bold temperament made his heart ceaselessly turbulent and be infatuated with her.It was more and more impossible to retrieve his gaze upon her, and he only desired to hide her away, letting her shine bright only for him.1Hmmm, that translation should be fine. If I think of a better way to translate \u5927\u9646\u98ce\u4e91\u4e89\u9738\u8d5b I'll update it.2Rise up and become stronger because of the encounter.3Whatever happens isn't up to others to decide but themselves, and they will definitely triumph over any obstacle.Note: Changed Yan'zhou Country to Yan'zhou Kingdom. It's probably a really irrelevant change, but I felt Kingdom suited better lol.Note: So it's been a while since 'Chi'huo Continent' had been mentioned, I feel like it was a typo by the author. I'll translate a bit more to see. If it was, I'll go back to correct the two times that 'Chi'huo Continent' had been mentioned into 'Tian'ling Continent'.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The fact that the Academy sent Lan Si as the team's head instructor meant they really attached great importance to the Selection Trial.\u201cIn the next month, we're very happy to be your team's lead instructors.\u201d On Lan Si's gentle, handsome face was a smile like the spring breeze. Then he blinked at the several people playfully, \u201cBut we won't go easy on you guys.\u201dThe several people were mesmerised by Lan Si's gentle smile, and they were very grateful that he was the head instructor this time.Lou Mu Yan, however, weighed him out in her heart. Lan Si definitely wasn't as gentle as he appeared on the surface. This person was wearing a mask.\u201cPrincipal, where are we going for the Trial?\u201d Lou Mu Bai asked.When faced with Lou Mu Bai, Ruan Li's attitude was extremely nice, \u201cThis time, the Trial site's set in the Glacial Mountain Range. Aside for the two Trial teams of Yan'zhou Kingdom, the Ten Distinguished Clans of the Eastern Region also have their own trials in the Glacial Mountain Range.\u201d\u201cThey're participating in the Selection Trials with us?\u201d Lou Mu Bai's eyes revealed slight surprise.\u201cNo. Their Trial standards and criteria are even harder than yours, but it's inevitable that your two parties will meet. At that time, keep a low profile and don't cause trouble.\u201d Ruan Li said seriously. Even the Empire's Imperial Family didn't dare provoke the core children of the Ten Distinguished Clans.\u201cThen is the Trial team selected by the Empire's Imperial Family going with us?\u201d A student asked.Ruan Li nodded: \u201cOf course. Your two teams have to compete for those six spots together. For the sake of fairness, all Trial missions are the same.\u201d\u201cCan we form an alliance with each other?\u201d Fu Chen thought for a bit then asked.\u201cNo matter what methods you use, as long as it doesn't endanger the lives of the people who participate in the Trials together, then it's fine.\u201d Ruan Li took a sip of tea and cautioned them: \u201cThere were once two teams who participated in the Trials that worked together at the beginning to deal with another team, so you must be careful.\u201cOf course, you'd all have to work together in the beginning, otherwise what awaits is only elimination.\u201dThen Ruan Li answered the questions of a few other students. Seeing that they had spent quite some time here, he knocked his finger on the desk and said: \u201cIt's getting late. You should all go back and rest first. Report to the Academy after three days. The three instructors will lead you to the Glacial Mountain Range to join the Imperial team.\u201d\u201cYes, Principal.\u201d The eleven people stood up and prepared to leave.Except the moment Lou Mu Yan turned around, she heard Ruan Li's telepathic voice.\u201cCome find me later.\u201dLou Mu Yan's steps paused. Although she didn't know why the Principal looked for her, but she nodded slightly to indicate that she knew.After leaving the hall together, Chi Yi Xuan walked to Lou Mu Yan and his eyes were softer than ever, \u201cMu Yan, let's team up during the Trial.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Lou Mu Yan was a little surprised by Chi Yi Xuan's attitude, but didn't want to have anything to do with him, so she refused without hesitation.Chi Yi Xuan's brows furrowed together. He initially thought that after making such a request, Lou Mu Yan would be very happy like usual, and would agree, but he didn't expect to be rejected.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksA sudden panic rose in his heart. Something felt like it had changed. He could potentially be losing something important, but he couldn't catch onto what this inexplicable feeling was.\u201cYou'd be safer with me.\u201d Although he was dissatisfied by Lou Mu Yan's refusal, but he urgently wanted to bound himself with Lou Mu Yan from the bottom of his heart, so he said with a stiff expression, holding back his feelings.Lou Mu Bai's indifferent eyes were dyed with slight unhappiness. He stood in front of Lou Mu Yan and blocked Chi Yi Xuan's vision, speaking neither heavily nor lightly: \u201cMy little sister naturally has my protection, so I won't bother Sir Chi.\u201dAfter he finished speaking, he didn't care about Chi Yi Xuan's reaction and pulled Lou Mu Yan to leave.When his younger sister loved Chi Yi Xuan so deeply that she would even die for him, that man didn't cherish it. Now that he discovered how good his treasured younger sister was, he wanted her back. Humph, how could there be such a convenient thing.Lou Mu Yan casually glanced at Chi Yi Xuan whose face was half-stiff and blue. Her lips raised into a very shallow arc, and she passed him with her eldest brother.Chi Yi Xuan stared at the backs of the brother and sister leaving, face dark and gaze obscure. Who knew what he was thinking.\u201cBig brother, the Principal told me telepathically to go and find him just now.\u201d After walking for a while, Lou Mu Yan grabbed Lou Mu Bai's arm and said.Lou Mu Bai didn't know why the Principal wanted to find his younger sister, but it wouldn't be something bad, \u201cYou can go, I'll wait for you in the small building where you live to go home together.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201dWhen Lou Mu Yan returned to the hall again, there were only the two brothers, Ruan Li and Ruan Yang sitting on the main seats.\u201cPrincipal, did you need me for something?\u201d Lou Mu Yan walked in front of the two and asked with a smile.\u201cIndeed.\u201d Ruan Li took out two brocade boxes from his interspatial ring, handed them to Lou Mu Yan and said: \u201cThese two things are the prizes for the winner of the Earth Class. Do you like it?\u201dLou Mu Yan didn't expect the Academy to give her bonus rewards, but she wasn't ceremonious either, and opened the box in front of the two.The inner layer of the first box was made of Millennial Profound Ice, and within there was what appeared to be an aged Seven-Leaf Ginseng.A hint of joy flashed past Lou Mu Yan's eyes\u2014she truly was lucky this time.One of the three main ingredients for the Foundation Establishment Pill, the Purple Monkey Flower, had already been won by her from the last auction and now she obtained the Seven-Leaf Ginseng. Meanwhile she could take advantage of the Trial this time to find the Deep Orchid.She believed that it wouldn't take long before she could gather and refine the Spiritual Herbs required for the Foundation Establishment Pill. Once she advanced to the Foundation Establishment Stage, her strength would greatly improve, and she'd have more confidence for the Continental Tournament for Hegemony.Lou Mu Yan's eyes were as bright as the stars, and she clenched her hands into fists tightly, thinking about how she must refine the Foundation Establishment Pill before the Continental Tournament for Hegemony.She closed the box containing the Seven-Leaf Ginseng, then opened the other box. Inside was a scarlet-gold whip. On the whip, there were faint fluctuations of Spiritual Energy, indicating that it was a Middle-Quality Spirit Treasure.\u201cI obtained this long whip by accident. I found that you didn't like using swords too much, so I thought to gift this to you.\u201d Alchemist Ruan Yang who sat next to Ruan Li explained in a good mood upon seeing Lou Mu Yan's dazed expression when seeing the long whip.Lou Mu Yan closed the brocade box, thought a moment, then smiled and said: \u201cI thank Principal and Alchemist Ruan for your kindness. Mu Yan accepts. I do indeed need the Seven-Leaf Ginseng, so I will accept, but forgive me as I dare not take this long whip.\u201dShe really did like this scarlet-gold whip, but she shouldn't accept a reward when it wasn't deserved. She felt that it wasn't so simple for Ruan Yang to gift her this Spirit Treasure.Ruan Yang didn't expect Lou Mu Yan to reject such benefits. His desire to accept her as his disciple grew even stronger, and a more sincere smile rose on his face, \u201cThis Spirit Treasure is a gift for you. Why, do you not like it?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She knew that Ruan Yang wasn't a scheming person, and was instead upright, so she didn't want to speak in circles.\u201cElder Yang, it's not that I don't like this Magic Treasure, but I did nothing to deserve this reward. Why don't you speak directly of the purpose of finding me today.\u201d She could tell that the main person that looked for her today was Ruan Yang.\u201cHAHA! Straightforward!\u201d Ruan Li liked to deal with straightforward people. He stroked his red beard with a look as if he was thirsting for water, \u201cLou girl, you're born to be an Alchemist with such skilful use of fire Elemental Energy. Are you interested in becoming a disciple of mine?\u201cAs long as you become my disciple, I'll definitely do my best to teach you, and you can use the resources of the Academy as you wish.\u201d In order to be able to keep the good seedling, Ruan Yang added.The resources of the Academy could be used by her as she wishes? The corners of Ruan Li's mouth twitched. He knew just how ruthless this girl was in terms of cheating people of their things.Lou Mu Yan didn't expect that Ruan Yang actually wanted to take her in as a disciple. She put away the surprise in her heart, then politely refused: \u201cApologies, Elder Yang. I have already accepted a senior as my Master in the Blazing Mountain Range, and without his permission, I dare not become a disciple of another person.\u201dHer Alchemy attainments were probably pretty well matched with even the best Alchemists on Tian'ling Continent. She also owned countless peerless pill recipes, so Ruan Yang couldn't teach her anything. Not to mention, her aspirations didn't end at Yan'zhou Kingdom, so it was even more impossible for her to recognise Ruan Yang as her Master.\u201cIn that case, I won't force it.\u201d Ruan Yang revealed some disappointment. But after thinking about it, he smiled and said: \u201cYou like this Spirit Treasure, but you don't want to take it for no reason. Then how about we make a deal.\u201d\u201cWhat deal?\u201d Lou Mu Yan asked.\u201cHow about you give me two of your Energy Nourishing Pills?\u201d Last time, the Energy Nourishing Pills that Lou Mu Yan gave Yun Tian Chen were given to the enshrined Alchemist of the Imperial Family to research. But Ruan Yang was itching with interest, so even though he couldn't gain a disciple, he thought to exchange two pills to research.Of course, it wasn't that he didn't want the Marrow Cleansing Pill, but a Middle-Grade Spirit Treasure's value simply couldn't be compared to the Marrow Cleansing Pill's value, and he didn't want to be forceful even more. When Lou Mu Yan's Master appeared, then he would pay him a personal visit to discuss the matter.Lou Mu Yan nodded and directly took out a bottle of Energy Nourishing Pills to hand over. When Ruan Li took the Energy Nourishing Pills, she unceremoniously put away the scarlet-gold whip.Before she could refine her own Natal Magic Treasure, this long whip was the only Spirit Treasure that caught her eyes. In this deal, she profited.After extracting some more information about the Continental Tournament for Hegemony from Ruan Li, and then chatting a little more with the two, Lou Mu Yan left the hall with a bright smile.After she left completely, Ruan Li played with the teacup in his hand and said, \u201cWhat do you think of this girl?\u201d\u201cNot bad. She's a wonderful mould that could be sculpted1. But with her talent, I'm afraid that she wouldn't be limited within Yan'zhou Kingdom's skies and land. The outside world was more suitable for her.\u201d Ruan Yang said after pausing for a moment. While his temper was straightforward, he wasn't stupid. The little girl of the Lou Clan wasn't simple at all.\u201cMm. I have a feeling that she'd be able to stand out in the Selection Trial this time.\u201d Ruan Li stared at the door not far away with a look of expectation in his eyes.\u201cLet's wait and see.\u201d Ruan Yang nodded. He was also slightly anticipating Lou Mu Yan's performance in the Selection Trial.The moment Lou Mu Yan and Lou Mu Bai arrived back home, they were welcomed by a beautiful married woman.\u201cYan'er.\u201d The beautiful married woman walked quickly towards Lou Mu Yan and pulled her into an embrace, her eyes layered with a thin mist.\u201cMother!\u201d Lou Mu Yan felt the other party's body temperature and her heart trembled, a warmth rising in her smile.Ling Yue Xin quickly wiped the tears from the corner of her eyes and checked her daughter all around. This time, as an issue had popped up, she returned to her natal home, but who would've thought that she missed her daughter's growth. She truly felt regretful.\u201cYan'er truly has grown up!\u201dLou Mu Yan felt that her mother was very strong on the outside, but the moment she was in front of her, it was as if she had turned into water2. She couldn't bear the teary eyes and cast a look at Lou Mu Bai beside her for help.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksLou Mu Bai chuckled gently, looked at Ling Yue Xin softly and said, \u201cMother, what's going on at maternal grandfather's house?\u201dSpeaking of her natal home, Ling Yue Xin's arched eyebrows furrowed and sighed: \u201cYour maternal grandfather was injured, but now he's recovered a lot. It's just that the Xue Clan is truly pushing it too far. They actually cooperated with the Mu'rong Clan to suppress the Ling Clan.\u201dA layer of ice formed in her eyes, \u201cThe Xue Clan's youngest daughter's very talented. I heard that she'll be admitted to a Sect after participating in the Tournament for Hegemony, and also used that to personally come and annul the engagement with Fei Yang.\u201d\u201cMaternal grandpa was injured? Fei Yang's engagement was also annulled?\u201d A killing intent flashed past Lou Mu Bai's eyes.\u201cYeah! Your maternal grandfather was injured by a high-level Sword Monarch some time ago. He hid it before because he's afraid that you'd all be worried.\u201cFei Yang hadn't left his house ever since that incident. If Xue Ling wanted to sincerely annul the engagement before, the Ling Clan wouldn't force the engagement either, but this she was slapping the Ling Clan's face on purpose, in public, by coming with so many people to do so. Fei Yang, that child, has always been sensitive, and even if he always has a smile, I'm afraid that he's feeling extremely unhappy inside.\u201d When Ling Yue Xin thought of her nephew, she felt extremely sad.In Lou Mu Yan's memory, her maternal grandpa was a very loving and kind elder. Even if she was trash, he didn't dislike her and loved her very much. Ling Fei Yang was her elder cousin, and different to Lou Mu Bai's indifference and serenity, his temperament was gentle from the inside to the outside, and also treated her extremely well.As far as she knew, the Ling Clan was one of the Ten Distinguished Spirit Sword Clans, and, previously, their Clan's strength could rank in the top five.But ten years ago, her genius maternal uncle that once shocked and amazed the entire Tian'ling Continent disappeared when exploring a Secret Realm and hadn't returned since. His life or death was unknown. The Sword Sovereign Ancestor of the Ling Clan was in Life-or-Death Seclusion and hadn't appeared in more than twenty years. No one knew if he had advanced or not.Six years ago, her cousin, Ling Fei Yang, was seriously injured because he offended a Devil Cultivator for Xue Ling. What's more, his legs were poisoned and became immovable due to that incident.The Ling Clan that was already experiencing frost being added to snow3, was then jointly suppressed by the Mu'rong Clan and the Xin Clan who had risen to power after the Ling Clan. Now they were backstabbed by the Xue Clan that always had a good relationship with the Ling Clan. The Clan's strength had greatly decreased and was now barely at the end of the ranking of the Ten Distinguished Clans.\u201cAnnulling the engagement with such an ungrateful woman is good.\u201d Lou Mu Bai sneered.When his younger cousin acted to protect Xue Ling that time, it was because she was his fianc\u00e9. Who knew that that woman would be this snobbish. It didn't matter that she didn't remember the kindness, yet now she dropped stones onto someone who had fallen into a well4\u2014it was truly despicable.Lou Mu Yan pursed her lips, and a layer of cold light overflowed from the depths of her eyes. Mu'rong Clan, Xin Clan and the Xue Clan\u2014she noted them down.\u201cMother, elder cousin still can't move his legs now?\u201d Lou Mu Yan remembered that Ling Fei Yang was also a proud child favoured by the Heavens. However, now that he couldn't walk, they didn't know whether her eldest maternal uncle was alive or not, and with the Ling Clan in such danger, he must be feeling extreme pressure.\u201cYeah! The poison in his body couldn't be cured even after inviting numerous Alchemists and Physicians. That Devil Cultivator's also dead. Who knows how much more torture Fei Yang that child must endure.\u201d Ling Yue Xin's eyes were full of worry.Since her eldest brother disappeared, her nephew appeared to have changed into a completely different person. When she met him this time, his temperament was especially indifferent. The flamboyant brilliance that he used to carry had long disappeared.Lou Mu Yan took Ling Yue Xin's hand and comforted her: \u201cMother, don't worry, everything will all get better.\u201dIt seemed that after the Selection Trial was over, she was bound to pay a visit to the Ling Clan.As for that Xue Ling who personally came to annul the engagement, hence slapping their faces, she believed that they would definitely meet in the Glacial Mountain Range this time.Xue Ling wanted to participate in the Continental Tournament for Hegemony and obtain the qualifications to enter a Sect? Humph\u2014as long as she was there, she'd surely let that woman lose more than her gains, pound her into the dust, and make her life worse than death.1like diamond in the rough.2weak, fragile, gentle, pure etc.3idiom meaning to make things even word, equivalent to add insult to injury.4idiom meaning to hit a person when they're already down.

The leader of the group was precisely Lan Si in blue brocade.After a day's journey, when night fell, they booked a room to rest at an inn in a remote town.After bathing, Lou Mu Yan went downstairs to dine with the others.When Lan Si saw her come downstairs, he patted the seat next to him, smiled and said: \u201cLou Mu Yan, come and sit.\u201dLou Mu Yan was a little surprised by Lan Si's attitude towards her, but she didn't reject, walked over, and sat down naturally, then nodded and greeted the three instructors: \u201cTeacher Lan, Teacher Ji, Teacher Hu.\u201dThen some students came downstairs one after another. Lou Mu Bai walked straight towards Lou Mu Yan and sat down beside her. Fu Chen and Ji Han Xu also sat down in the remaining seats of the same table.The other people sat at the two tables beside them, but the gazes of a few people that looked towards Lou Mu Yan weren't very kind, especially the senior Earth Class female student who carried deep jealousy in her eyes.A person's position in a setting sometimes displayed the degree of attention they received and how highly they were thought of. Even if Lou Mu Yan wasn't a trash now, she was only the winner of the freshman Earth Class, so what qualifications did she have to sit at that table? But because of the instructors and Lou Mu Bai, she only dared to feel upset inwardly, and didn't dare to voice her objections aloud.\u201cLou Mu Yan, Ji Xuan and I need to thank you.\u201d Lan Si flipped over a teacup, poured a cup of tea, and looked at Lou Mu Yan with a smile in his eyes.Lou Mu Yan raised her eyebrow and asked: \u201cI don't remember when I ever had an interaction with Teacher Lan and Teacher Ji?\u201dShe narrowed her eyes, wondering just what this fox1\u00a0wanted to do?\u201cActually, it's not that big a deal. It's just that us instructors made a bet before the Grand Competition, betting on who would obtain the only place in the freshman Earth Class between you and Gu Yan Ran. Ji Xuan and I bet on you, and in the end, we won.\u201d Lan Si's handsome, pretty face revealed a smile that made people feel uncontrollably drawn to.\u201cYeah! The stakes are small, but whether we win or lose impacts our face, which is significant. You've definitely given us a lot of face.\u201d Ji Xuan's beautiful face revealed a dazzling brightness. She had a good impression of Lou Mu Yan.Lou Mu Yan looked at the two teachers, who appeared as if they feared that there wasn't enough chaos in the world, with a headache. Didn't they realise that Hu Fei's dark face was about to turn into ink2? Without even needing to think about it, one could guess that Hu Fei definitely bet that Gu Yan Ran would win. What these two were doing was the typical case of pulling aggro3\u00a0for her!\u201cThen I'm really honoured. But since teachers won the bet because of me, then shouldn't it be 'those who see have a share'4?\u201d Lou Mu Yan smiled, as if saying 'if you don't give anything to me, you're not generous or sincere'.She discovered that Lan Si and Ji Xuan were very friendly towards her, while even though the old man named Hu Fei tried hard to hide it, she caught onto his dislike for her.Hu Fei didn't like her, so naturally she wouldn't save face for him either. Not to mention, she even felt killing intent on Hu Fei from time to time, so she was a little more cautious against him.\u201cIt's a pity that we sold all the things we bet on.\u201d Lan Si chuckled, thought about it, then took out a few wooden boxes from his interspatial ring and threw them to Lou Mu Yan, \u201cThere are a few Spiritual Herbs inside, take it as a meeting gift.\u201dLou Mu Yan took the box unceremoniously, but didn't open it, and instead put it away, \u201cThank you, Teacher Lan!\u201dJi Xuan also preferred such straightforward people. She took out a tourmaline bracelet and handed it to Lou Mu Yan, saying with a smile: \u201cThis bracelet is for you.\u201dLou Mu Yan didn't feign modesty either, reached out her hand and took the bracelet. With one touch, she discovered the mystery within it\u2014it was a High-Quality Spirit Tool. Although the quality wasn't high, but within each tourmaline, there contained a special energy which could help an Alchemist reduce the consumption of Mental Energy when refining pills. It was indeed very useful.\u201cThank you, Teacher Ji!\u201d Lou Mu Yan slid the bracelet onto her wrist then and there. The fact that Ji Xuan gave her this bracelet meant that they knew of her identity as an Alchemist already. They were expressing good will towards her.She had a good impression of Lan Si and Ji Xuan, so naturally she accepted their goodwill.Except, the interaction between the three people were translated into a different meaning in the eyes of others. Some students at the two tables beside them didn't feel good about this situation. Wasn't it just that Lou Mu Yan was from a better family background? Was it worth it for the two instructors to express their goodwill like this?\u201cTeachers, isn't it 'those who see have a share4'? Then shouldn't you also give us some meeting gifts?\u201d Ji Han Xu glanced at Lou Mu Yan thoughtfully, then smiled and said to Lan Si and Ji Xuan playfully.Lan Si raised his eyebrows and said with a smile: \u201cYou also want a meeting gift? Sure, here you guys are.\u201d After saying that, he took out a handful of candy and threw a few to each of them.\u201cTeacher, you can't possibly be this stingy. You want to dismiss us with just a few candies?\u201d Ji Han Xu caught the candy and complained with a smile.\u201cThis is candy made from Spiritual Fruits. It can replenish your Elemental Energy during battle. If you don't want it, then return it.\u201d Lan Si's delicate and pretty face revealed a trace of playfulness.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksWhen Ji Han Xu heard that the candy had such an effect, he immediately put it away happily, \u201cWant, of course I want it!\u201dThe other people didn't expect this candy to have such an effect either and put it away as if a treasure.Lou Mu Yan picked up a candy and placed it in front of her nose for a sniff. An understanding crossed her eyes. Then she tossed the candy into her mouth to try its effect.The taste was rather sweet and sour, but the effect of replenishing Spiritual Energy was much worse than her Grade 1 Spiritual Energy Replenishing Pill.Seeing Lou Mu Yan directly pick up the candy and eat, the corner of everyone's mouth, except Lou Mu Bai, twitched. Did she have to be such a spendthrift? Although it's 'candy' so it's sugar, but it had the effect of a pill! Was it really good to be this luxurious?\u201cLou Mu Yan, this is what Teacher Lan gave us to use to replenish our Elemental Energy during battle. Aren't you failing his expectations by eating it just like this?\u201d The female student who won first place in the senior Earth Class said.Lou Mu Yan furrowed her brows. Why did she discover that she just wasn't agreeable to women? Most of the female Sword Masters she had met didn't like her\u2014but it's not like she had the face of a vixen5\u00a0either!Was it because people were jealous of her rising to greater heights from a trash? Or was it Lan Si and Ji Xuan's attitude towards her that they didn't like? Such people were truly too narrow-minded. They'd have a tough time walking on the path of the strong.Of course, if someone slapped her, it was impossible for her to show her other cheek and let them slap it too.\u201cTeacher Lan Si, did you just say that the candy is used to replenish our Elemental Energy in battle?\u201d Lou Mu Yan asked, blinking at Lan Si innocently.Lan Si chuckled: \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen did you not allow us to eat the candy, that you gifted us, right now?\u201d\u201cAlso no.\u201d\u201cThen have I failed you by eating the candy now?\u201d\u201cYou haven't.\u201dLou Mu Yan glanced at the woman with her beautiful eyes and sneered, \u201cThis Senior Sister, it seems that you aren't the roundworm in Teacher Lan's belly6.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The woman didn't expect Lou Mu Yan would ask Lan Si like this. Her face flushed red, unsure if it was because she was angered or because she was shamed.\u201cThis result tells you that you shouldn't pretend to be able to guess other people's thoughts. If you want to stand out, then you need to see if you have the capital to do so.\u201d Lou Mu Yan ridiculed coldly.The woman looked up and saw that there was also dissatisfaction in Lan Si's eyes. Her face paled, bit her lip and stopped talking.Then, Lou Mu Yan discovered that several of the senior students cast unkind glances at her. Her lips raised slightly in coldness. It was best to separate from these people when they reached the Blazing Mountain Range.1referring to Lan Si. Foxes are thought to be sly and cunning.2grow even darker like ink. Which means angered, dissatisfied etc.3'pulling aggro' or 'getting aggro' is a gaming term that's slipped into everyday use in China, usually to complain, sometimes jokingly, about how what someone says or does might cause people to hate them. I never knew that it was a gaming term until e-sports cdramas became popular a couple years back, like The King's Avatar, Falling Into Your Smile etc. hahaha I don't watch all e-sports dramas though, I'm a bit picky with dramas in general\u2026 XD The King's Avatar is a 10/10 for me for those that like esports. Watched the anime too (Chinese anime), do recommend. No romance though.4occassionally used shamelessly by people to say 'I want a share of that too' even though they might not have done anything to deserve it (but the party they're trying to take a share from might not have done anything to deserve it either). Literally, 'since I saw it as well, I should have a share of it'.5a bewitching, enchanting face that is often used to describe people that have a face that men are enchanted by, but other women might use to berate another women for (usually because of jealousy.)6a person who is 'a roundworm in my body' means they understand the person a lot. Not being 'a roundworm in my body' means they don't understand them at all. Usually used as a joke, is rather informal, though I've seen more serious dramas say it rhetorically. Till this day I have no idea why it's this particular parasite that's used in this metaphor. In a way I understand, in a way I don't. Did a quick search and apparently it comes from an old saying. Thought to keep this novel more authentic by leaving it as it is so as to learn more about Chinese culture? HahaRandom Note: Lmao, yup, females really don't like Lou Mu Yan. At least the author's aware of that too HAHARandom Note 2: Ahh\u2026. The cdrama Chef Hua is making me drool\u2026 the food looks so yummy\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 64: Chi Yi Xuan's\u00a0ProposalAfter eating, Lou Mu Yan saw the crescent moon that hung in the sky. Currently, at the location of the small town they were in, the essence of the sun and moon were the densest.She leapt out from her window and onto the rooftop. She sat cross-legged where it was darkest, closed her eyes and\u00a0performed a macrocosmic orbit skill around her\u00a0body, absorbing the essence of the moonlight.Two hours later, she discovered that someone arrived on the roof. Her hands danced in mid-air like butterfly wings, waiting for the macrocosmic orbiting skill to be completed.When she opened her eyes, she met Chi Yi Xuan's black eyes that carried complex colours. The moonlight poured on his cold facial features, softening his face a little bit.\u201cNeed something?\u201d Lou Mu Yan didn't look away, only looking at Chi Yi Xuan indifferently.Chi Yi Xuan suddenly had the urge to hold Lou Mu Yan in his arms. When he was practicing right now, he accidentally discovered that there was Lou Mu Yan's aura on the rooftop, so came up as if he was controlled by something.And what entered his eyes was a graceful woman with her eyes closed, breathing beneath the moonlight, her hands dancing as part of a skill, and a thin, white, soft light enveloped her, giving her a kind of cold and ethereal feel that he had never seen before.\u201cMu Yan, can we discuss something?\u201d\u201cWhat do I have to discuss with you?\u201d Lou Mu Yan smiled with ridicule.The colours in Chi Yi Xuan's eyes were clear to her. This man fell in love with her. But so what? She was no longer the Lou Mu Yan she used to be.\u201cMust we choke each other like this when we talk?\u201d Chi Yi Xuan couldn't help but furrow his brows. Since when did Lou Mu Yan change her docile personality towards him to constantly fighting against him? It seemed that it was since Gu Yan Ran injured her\u2026Lou Mu Yan didn't want to be entangled with Chi Yi Xuan too much. Clearing things up was good, so she nodded: \u201cSpeak.\u201d\u201cCan we go back to how we were?\u201d Chi Yi Xuan pressed his lips together tightly, his jawline clearly defined.\u201cCannot.\u201d\u201cWhy? Are you still blaming me for not preventing Gu Yan Ran from injuring you last time?\u201d The veins on Chi Yi Xuan's hands that were hidden in his sleeves popped as his palms were full of sweat.Lou Mu Yan raised her eyebrow and said: \u201cYou know, and you still ask?\u201d This man definitely had a problem.\u201cLast time you targeted her first. I don't know when your temper became so unreasonable. Last time she taught you a lesson, I didn't do anything not because I supported her, but because I wanted you to be more thoughtful after experiencing that.\u201d Chi Yi Xuan's expression was stained with a layer of helpless sadness.At the time, it's true he didn't stop Gu Yan Ran from teaching Lou Mu Yan a lesson. But when Lou Mu Yan's dan'tian was almost destroyed by Gu Yan Ran, he was about to act, except Yun Jin was one step ahead.It was true that he used to find it bothersome to be pestered by Lou Mu Yan, but they essentially grew up together since they were children, so he wouldn't watch her be beaten to death.It was just that he didn't expect that when he fell in love with her now, that incident would cause an irreparable gap between them.\u201cWhen I was unconscious last time, that Soul Condensing Pill was sent by you?\u201dSeeing that the helplessness in Chi Yi Xuan's eyes when speaking about the incident wasn't fake, Lou Mu Yan suddenly remembered that she had relied on that Soul Condensing Pill to merge all of her into this body, so she took a guess and asked.After waking up last time, she asked her grandfather and the others about the Soul Condensing Pill, but they all hesitated. Not long ago, the Lou Clan even inexplicably helped the Chi Clan find a rare Crystal Stone. At the time, she felt that something was strange.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThe most important thing was that there were only two clans in the entire Imperial Capital who had a Soul Condensing Pill, and the Chi Clan was one of them. The other Clan and the Lou Clan had a bad relationship, so it was impossible for them to take out such a precious pill for her.\u201cGrandpa Lou said it?\u201d Chi Yi Xuan didn't want to use the situation of the pill to seek any rewards from Lou Mu Yan, so he never mentioned it in front of her.\u201cI guessed.\u201d Lou Mu Yan half-closed her eyes, covering up the change in her eyes.She really didn't expect Chi Yi Xuan actually helped her once. If it weren't for that Soul Condensing Pill, even if the previous Lou Mu Yan had willingly offered her body to her, her Soul wouldn't have been able to merge so perfectly with this body.\u201cCount this as me owing you a personal favour!\u201d Lou Mu Yan said after a long silence.What the previous Lou Mu Yan did for Chi Yi Xuan was more than what a Soul Condensing Pill could be used to repay, so she would repay this personal favour, but to Chi Yi Xuan, it was\u00a0just\u00a0a personal favour.\u201cNo need. I never thought to make you pay back that favour.\u201d Anger slowly rose on Chi Yi Xuan's face.He also didn't know why, at the time, he would send his family's precious Soul Condensing Pill, that was rewarded to him, to the Lou Clan. Maybe because he felt he owed her a lot, but at the time, he was certain he hadn't fallen in love with Lou Mu Yan yet.Right now, he didn't want Lou Mu Yan's return of favour for giving her the pill. He only wanted her, nothing more. But he didn't want to say it, afraid that it would scare her away.\u201cIf I owe it, I owe it. Whether you want it or not, I'll remember the favour and will eventually return it to you.\u201d She hated owing favours, not to mention a favour from Chi Yi Xuan who had once hurt the original owner of this body, so whether this man wanted it or not, she would repay it.\u201cMust you really be so distant with me?\u201d Chi Yi Xuan suddenly stepped forward and half-squatted in front of Lou Mu Yan, with a trace of anger in his eyes.Lou Mu Yan didn't avoid him, and met his fiery gaze coldly. \u201cAre we familiar?\u201d\u201cThen what was your affection for me before? Just because of a past event, are you going to completely erase our affections?\u201d Chi Yi Xuan couldn't accept the indifference and coldness in Lou Mu Yan's eyes, as if they had really become strangers.\u201cHa\u2026\u201d Lou Mu Yan raised her head and let out a soft laugh, then stared at Chi Yi Xuan and said: \u201cThe feelings I had for you, did you accept it? No. Have we ever had love between us? Even more, no.\u201cSo, Chi Yi Xuan, don't imagine that your love's being reciprocated. When I genuinely liked you, you didn't cherish it, now that I hate you, you come to pester me. You really are looking for pain.\u201d Lou Mu Yan raised her hand and pushed Chi Yi Xuan, who had gotten close to her, away. She didn't like men who were strangers to be so close to herself and hoped even more that this man would stop pestering her, so her tone was very awful.Chi Yi Xuan took a deep breath and resisted the urge to strangle this cruel woman. A little madness appeared on his face, \u201cYes, I'm looking for pain. I admit that I like you now.\u201dThen he suddenly stretched out his hand and grabbed Lou Mu Yan's beautiful wrist, his eyes firm and eager, saying: \u201cMu Yan, can you give me a chance?\u201dThe corner of Lou Mu Yan's lips curled up, then approached Chi Yi Xuan's ear. Her red lips uttered cruel words, instantly shattering all of Chi Yi Xuan's illusions and hopes.\u201cCan't. There is absolutely no possibility between us. Even if I die, I won't choose you again.\u201d\u201cLou Mu Yan, you're truly ruthless.\u201d Chi Yi Xuan turned his head and a faint fragrance of medicine lingered around his nose from Lou Mu Yan. Finally unable to control himself, he pulled hard and wanted to hug this woman, who he loved and hated, tightly in his arms.Except, before the person was pulled closer, Lou Mu Yan flexibly pulled her wrist out of his grip, out of his control.She looked at him with an unhappy expression and said something that made him heartbroken, \u201cYou were asking for everything. If you want to look for pain, then do it yourself secretly. I don't have time to be entangled with you.\u201dRandom Note: Love her direct personality, honestly. Tell him, tell him! Make this clear, that's how you do it. Don't be wishy-washy. I actually can't remember what happens to him eventually even after re-reading this novel so many times HAHAHA. I only remember the main events (mostly) and the main characters. Oh well, let's see how he develops. I mean, I guess it's a good thing I can't remember, whenever I read, I'll still be curious hahaha.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 65: Glacial\u00a0City\u201cLou Mu Yan.\u201d Chi Yi Xuan couldn't help but shout grimly with countless emotions surging in his eyes.He had never been rejected like this before, and he wanted to turn around and leave immediately. This was the first time he had been embarrassed like this.But he was afraid. He was afraid that if he left, there really wouldn't be any more possibilities between him and Lou Mu Yan. He had always been calm and wise, but ever since falling in love with Lou Mu Yan, she had broken all his rationality.Remembering how Lou Mu Yan used to love so humbly in front of him, and silently did things for him, yet he was so dismissive of such feelings, and now that they had changed positions, he realised how bad he treated her then.\u201cI'll treat you well in the future. I promise.\u201d Chi Yi Xuan was reluctant to let go\u2014and couldn't let go anymore.During this period of time, Lou Mu Yan's beautiful purple figure often appeared in his mind. How she affected his heart and made him fall for her. After experiencing true love, how could he retrieve it?\u201cI don't need it. Chi Yi Xuan, just stand there and clear your mind.\u201d Lou Mu Yan took a step back, raised her eyes and looked at him seriously, saying word by word: \u201cWe will never be able to. Just give up.\u201dAs soon as she finished speaking, she utilised the Spiritual Energy in her body and left the room in a flash, leaving only Chi Yi Xuan standing there, motionless, with deep regret and pain.Early the next morning, when the sky was faintly lit, Lan Si took the dozen or so people on their Tailwind Horses and galloped away.Half a month later, Lou Mu Yan and her party finally arrived at the Glacial City that was at the foot of the Glacial Mountain Range.The Glacial City was an independent city, not belonging to any country, but was instead controlled by a mysterious entity.Many years ago, other empires or distinguished clans wanted to get involved with this city and take over, but were all suppressed, and suffered a tragic blow. After that, no one dared to reach their hands towards Glacial City.The Glacial City was located on the southeast side of the Glacial Mountain Range. If one wanted to enter the Glacial Mountain Range, they must pass Glacial City. Therefore, the prosperity of Glacial City wasn't worse than the capital of a small country.The towering city walls encircled Glacial City. Pairs of armoured soldiers patrolled the city, and security teams were set up at particular sections of the city to maintain order.At the gate of the city stood two rows of well-trained soldiers whose cultivation bases were all above Sword Apprentice. The small team's leader was even an Advanced-Phase Great Sword Master.When the group rode their horses to the city gate, they stopped. There was a checkpoint there. If one wanted to enter Glacial City, they must pay the entrance fee.Of course, after paying the fee, the lives of everyone in Glacial City were guaranteed. Fighting wasn't allowed in the city, and if one violated the rules, they'd be killed without pardon.\u201cThe entrance fee is ten ink-gold coins per person.\u201d A soldier in white armour stopped the group of people and said emotionlessly.Lan Si threw the bag of ink-gold coins that he had prepared previously over, \u201cCan we enter now?\u201dThe man opened the money bag, poured the ink-gold coins on the counter, then took out a dozen or so notices from the desk and handed them over, \u201cYou may enter. These are the city's rules and must be followed.\u201dLan Si took the notices, glanced at it casually, then waved to the others, \u201cLet's go!\u201dAfter entering the city, what one saw first was the bustling streets, while the buildings were also very distinctive. The top of each grey brick building was conical, and it was said to be convenient for placing Crystal Stones that helped preserve heat.The crowd swarmed along the way, extremely lively, and from time to time, one could hear the sound of hawking1.They rode slowly across several main streets and checked in at an inn with an elegant and quiet environment.\u201cTeacher, does the Imperial Family's team also live in this inn?\u201d Ji Han Xu was more cheerful and talked the most along the way.Lan Si handed out the keys of the rooms to everyone, looked up and said: \u201cNo, they live elsewhere. We'll meet them at the Glacial Mountain Range.\u201d\u201cDoes Teacher know which inn they're living in?\u201d Ji Han Xu pursued.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksLan Si raised his eyebrow, \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d\u201cI have something personal to find Yun Ge for.\u201d Ji Han Xu touched his head with a smile.\u201cYou don't need to conceal your little thoughts. When you reach the Glacial Mountain Range, whether you team up with the students of this Academy or team up with the Empire's Trial Team, we won't interfere, as long as you don't cause any deaths.\u201d Lan Si paused and smiled thoughtfully, \u201cBut there are only six Trial places, you should all seize the opportunity.\u201d\u201cTeacher, didn't the Principal tell us, as Imperial Academy students, to team up together against the outsiders?\u201d A senior student from the Heaven Class asked in confusion.The corner of Lan Si's mouth curled into a meaningful arc and asked, \u201cDo you think the eleven of you can unite as one?\u201dHe already knew that the person who had asked this question had already formed a secret alliance with several other students, and they were rejecting of Lou Mu Yan. Since they didn't like Lou Mu Yan, naturally it'd be impossible for Lou Mu Bai and Chi Yi Xuan to cooperate with them.\u201cThat's\u2026\u201d The person glanced at Lou Mu Yan in his peripheral vision. She was highly likely to hold everyone back, but because they were afraid of Lou Mu Bai rejecting, he wanted to reply that he could, but the female student in the Earth Class tugged his sleeves, so he stopped and made himself look as if he was thinking.Lou Mu Yan pursed her lips. These people were this rejecting of her, but she didn't want to participate in the Trials with them even more. When the time came, who knew who'd hold everyone back.\u201cEnough, I don't think you guys can unite. Just form a team freely, and you can even act alone.\u201d Lan Si truly couldn't be impressed with the judgement of these people. But that was fine. If these few people, who would hold people back, weren't there, Lou Mu Yan would have a better chance to advance.\u201cWe'll listen to Teacher.\u201d Ji Han Xu agreed with a wide grin.Of course he didn't want to join forces with the other people from the Academy. Among the eleven people, he only thought highly of Lou Mu Bai and Fu Chen. But amongst the two, one of them would definitely bring Lou Mu Yan, while the other was accustomed to being independent, so there wasn't a possibility of alliance at all.\u201cThese are the rules of the Glacial City. Take it and have a good look. Don't violate any rules, otherwise even I won't be able to protect you.\u201d Lan Si stuffed the notices in their hands with a serious expression.\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cTomorrow morning, we'll leave for the Glacial Mountain Range. You're free this evening. You can go wander around Glacial City. There are many Mercenaries and businessmen here, maybe you'll have some unexpected gains. You're dismissed.\u201d Lan Si instructed them a bit then left with the other two instructors first.Lou Mu Yan held the key and went upstairs with Lou Mu Bai. The others also left one after another, leaving only four people standing.\u201cIt seems that the strongest students have their allied teams already.\u201d One of the four said with worry.\u201cWhat're you afraid of? They still have to fight the Empire's Trial Team. When the sandpiper and the clam fight, the fisherman gains2. We may still have a chance.\u201d The male student, who previously asked Lan Si the question, said with calculating eyes.The other three smiled in understanding. That's right, until the very last moment, the result wasn't clear.Qu Le Xiang, who was the only female senior student among them, and the senior Earth Class's winner, looked in the direction of Lou Mu Yan's departure and resentment flashed past her eyes.She and Gu Yan Ran grew up together and were like close sisters, but very few people knew about it.This time she wouldn't only compete for a Trial place, but she would also avenge Gu Yan Ran. She deliberately confronted Lou Mu Yan before in order to reduce the defensiveness of several people towards her. After all, showing recklessness and brainlessness was also a good cover.At the same time.In the Ming Alliance of Merchant's main hall, on the main seat, a man who wore red clothes and a silver mask sat indolently. After listening to the report of the person in the lower seat of priority, his long and narrow eyes squinted, and he said softly: \u201cThe Glacial Mountain Range? Let's go and join the fun too.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness!\u201d1hawking as in, shouting for people to come and buy food. Just an fyi since I never knew this word existed until now HAHA2a Chinese idiom meaning when two party fights, a third, uninvolved party, could potentially take the benefits and advantage. Kind of like how when two people of equivalent strength fight, they may be injured severely, and a third person could take advantage to get rid of the two people together.Note: Yayy, Ming Xiu's back. Lmao, Chi Yi Xuan, *sigh*, Chi Yi Xuan. What can I say?Random Note: Ahh\u2026 finished Chef Hua\u2026 It was so cute and simplistic.

Seeing that it was still early, she went to invite Lou Mu Bai for a stroll around Glacial City. Except when they arrived downstairs, they met Chi Yi Xuan.\u201cBrother Lou, Mu Yan.\u201d Chi Yi Xuan walked to the two and greeted them, \u201cYou two are going out?\u201d\u201cYes. We're going out for a stroll.\u201d Lou Mu Bai nodded lightly. He didn't like Chi Yi Xuan, but he wouldn't reject him too much because of the situation with the Soul Condensing Pill.On Chi Yi Xuan's handsome face, there revealed a rare smile, \u201cI was just about to go out too, let's go together.\u201d\u201cIt's better to separate!\u201d Lu Mu Bai furrowed his brows slightly.\u201cI'm alone, I think it's best to go together.\u201d Chi Yi Xuan had made up his mind to redeem Lou Mu Yan, so said insistently.Lou Mu Bai glanced at Chi Yi Xuan lightly and found that his attitude was firm. His brows knitted even tighter together.He didn't know how his younger sister felt about Chi Yi Xuan right now, so he looked at Lou Mu Yan and asked, \u201cWhat do you think, little sister?\u201d\u201cWhatever he wants.\u201d Lou Mu Yan knew that even if she refused Chi Yi Xuan, this man that had suddenly gone crazy would still follow, so it was better to just let him.Lou Mu Bai saw the impatience in his younger sister's eyes and knew that she had truly cut and abandoned her love for Chi Yi Xuan. So he didn't care about Chi Yi Xuan's attitude, and instead, he felt that this situation was fine as it is\u2014let him have a taste of how it felt to desire yet not be able to obtain.When they left the inn, Lou Mu Yan asked Lou Mu Bai: \u201cEldest brother, where's the place the teacher spoke of?\u201d\u201cThat, I know.\u201d Chi Yi Xuan said before Lou Mu Bai could speak, \u201cThere's a large trading market in Glacial City. Aside from the permanent shops, many Mercenaries or outsiders will rent stalls to sell things gathered from the Glacial Mountain Range, like Demonic Beasts, Spiritual Herbs, Spiritual Stones and the like.\u201d\u201cAre there a lot of Spiritual Herbs?\u201d As an Alchemist, Lou Mu Yan naturally paid more attention to Spiritual Herbs.\u201cA lot. But there are very few high-level Spiritual Herbs. But if you're lucky, you might meet some.\u201d Chi Yi Xuan's tone was rather relaxed. He was fairly familiar with Glacial City, \u201cI've been here once, and I was able to buy the rare Ice Herb in the Trading Markets.\u201dIt was precisely because of that Ice Herb that the Alchemist enshrined by the family was able to refine the Soul Condensing Pill.\u201cIce Herb? That's not that bad. Let's go and take a look.\u201d Lou Mu Yan liked to study the Path of Alchemy back in the Cultivation World, and loved Spiritual Herbs even more, so she was rather excited for the trading market Chi Yi Xuan spoke of.\u201cAlright!\u201d Chi Yi Xuan agreed with a light smile.Lou Mu Yan discovered that the Chi Yi Xuan that had removed his aloofness seemed to be a completely different person. But this wasn't that important to her. She owed Chi Yi Xuan a personal favour, but once she repaid it, she believed that there wouldn't be too much interaction between them.When the three arrived at the trading market, night had arrived, and the night market just opened.The trading market was brightly lit, crowded with people, and Sword Masters wearing various different styles of clothes came and went. The atmosphere was extremely lively.When one walked through the gate of the trading market, one could see two passages. One of them lead to permanent shops, while the other lead to the free trade zone.\u201cThere are a lot of Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Stones from the Glacial Mountain Range in the permanent shops, but the price might be a bit higher. If you wanted to try your luck and hunt for treasure, the free trade zone's more appropriate.\u201d Seeing that Lou Mu Yan was staring at the two paths in thought, Chi Yi Xuan pointed to the one on the right and spoke.Lou Mu Yan nodded: \u201cThen let's head to the free trade zone first.\u201dThe three of them walked through the passage on the right. After entering the free trade zone, they heard a mixture of noise. There were stallholders shouting and selling, and there were buyers who were bargaining. In short, it was an extremely lively scene.Lou Mu Yan remembered that Mo Yan, in her Spirit Pet Bangle, had a keen eye, so she took him out and carried him in her arm to hunt for treasure.She started looking at the first booth with great interest, while Lou Mu Bai and Chi Yi Xuan followed behind her.When she saw something she was interested in, she picked it up and bargained with the stall owner. If it was suitable, she'd take it. After looking through half the stalls, the three of them all gained a lot.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksLou Mu Yan even bought a lot of Spiritual Herbs needed for refining pills, and Mo Yan also found several materials useful for refining Magic Tools.\u201cEldest brother, Mu Yan.\u201d The three of them were just looking at Crystals at a stall when they heard Yun Lan's voice from behind.\u201cCousin.\u201d Lou Mu Yan saw Yun Lan walking towards them, and a gentle smile rose on her face.\u201cYi Xuan, why are you here?\u201d Seeing that Chi Yi Xuan and Lou Mu Yan were together, Yun Jin felt a little strange, so he stepped forward and patted him on the shoulder, asking.Chi Yi Xuan didn't conceal anything, seeing that his friend had asked: \u201cI'm accompanying Brother Lou and Mu Yan for a look around.\u201d\u201cAccompanying Mu Yan? Have you two reconciled?\u201d Hearing Chi Yi Xuan say that, Yun Jin's eyes dulled. An inexplicable irritability rose in his heart, so he couldn't help but ask.\u201cYun Jin, you can eat whatever food you want, but you can't say whatever you want1.\u201d Lou Mu Yan looked askance at Yun Jin\u2014what did he mean by reconciled? She didn't want to continue to have anything to do with Chi Yi Xuan, nor be branded by him at all.Chi Yi Xuan's eyes darkened, but he didn't explain. Since he was determined to obtain Lou Mu Yan, then he had to show some sincerity.When Yun Jin heard Lou Mu Yan say this, he didn't know why, but his mood was instantly healed. He didn't say anything more on this topic with them either.Yun Lan glanced at Chi Yi Xuan surreptitiously, and seeing the dejected look on his face, a slight arc rose on his lips, then he retracted his gaze.\u201cDid you guys gain anything?\u201d Yun Lan asked Lou Mu Yan with softness in his eyes.Lou Mu Yan smiled and said, \u201cIt was alright. I bought some Spiritual Herbs, but we didn't encounter anything special. How about you guys?\u201d\u201cWe also didn't buy anything rare. We were about to go look in the commercial street.\u201d Yun Lan said.\u201cThen you guys can go to the commercial street, we'll finish shopping here first.\u201d Lou Mu Yan had a constant feeling that if she left this free trade zone, she'd miss something significant.Yun Jin leaned forward with a smile and said: \u201cHow about together, we'll wander around again.\u201d\u201cLet's go together. I also have something I want to tell you guys.\u201d Yun Lan did indeed have something to discuss with Lou Mu Yan and Lou Mu Bai.\u201cAlright, let's go. We'll talk while we walk.\u201d Lou Mu Yan reckoned that Yun Lan probably came to find them about an alliance.After walking for a while, Yun Lan lowered his head beside Lou Mu Yan and whispered: \u201cLet's form an alliance for the Trial in the Glacial Mountain Range.\u201d\u201cSure!\u201d Lou Mu Yan agreed without hesitation. She wasn't familiar with the Glacial Mountain Range, and she much preferred to advance and obtain a Trial place with people she knew, so she didn't reject the proposal of an alliance.Yun Lan didn't expect her to agree to readily. There was joy in his eyes. Then seeing some ruckus occurring in front, with even the word 'treasure' thrown about, he pointed: \u201cLet's take a look.\u201dThe rest were also attracted by the ruckus and walked over there together.As soon as they approached, they heard someone say to the stall owner: \u201cDo you have a delusional disorder? For this broken thing to be traded with a Tier 5 or even higher-level Demonic Beast skin, aren't you just indulging in a wild fantasy.\u201d\u201cThis sort of thing's also considered a treasure? What a waste of our time.\u201d\u201cThat's right! Only the Crystals beside it are alright, but you want to sell it as a bundle, and you even want to exchange it with a Demonic Beast skin. It's not like we're foolish spenders.\u201d\u201cQuickly squeeze through and take a look.\u201d Mo Yan's voice that carried with it a bit of eagerness sounded in Lou Mu Yan's Sea of Consciousness.When she lowered her head, she saw her little beast's eyes glowing brightly. An understanding smile rose on her lips, and she quickly squeezed through.1a popular saying that means you need to watch what you say because it can potentially be bad for others.Random Note: Yes girl, thanks for being this direct about your 'relationship' with Chi Yi Xuan XD Don't let others misunderstand! Man, Chi Yi Xuan sure is desperate. Well, we've got more people evidently interested in her now. Let's see how that goes when Ming Xiu appears hahahaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 67: Contend\u00a0ForAfter Lou Mu Yan squeezed through, she saw a sloppy middle-aged man with a stall in front of him. On the stall was a pile of Crystals that were suitable for refining Magic Tools. Among them was a palm-sized dark grey stone that caught her attention.\u201cBuy that dark grey rock. You must buy it.\u201d Mo Yan's eager voice resounded in her Sea of Consciousness.Lou Mu Yan gently poked the little beast on his back with her finger, indicating that she knew.After listening carefully to the conversations around her, Lou Mu Yan obtained some useful information from their words.This middle-aged man wanted to trade the Crystal on the table, but he required the dark grey stone to be the main item of trade. More importantly, he only wanted a Demonic Beast skin of Tier 5 or higher. Those that didn't know the value of the grey stone all thought the man was just indulging in a wild fantasy.The Crystal's qualities were all quite good, so it attracted a lot of people's attention, but it was a pity that the man simply wouldn't yield, so after so long, the things on the stall still hadn't been traded out.Lou Mu Yan held back the look in her eyes, reached out and picked up the dark grey stone in her hand to play with, then asked casually: \u201cWhat kind of Crystal is this?\u201dShe had observed from the look of the man that even he didn't know the origin of this stone, that's why she asked this question.The middle-aged man raised his head and glanced at Lou Mu Yan impatiently, \u201cDon't know.\u201d\u201cYou don't know and you still want to trade this for such a high-level Demonic Beast skin?\u201d Xiao Zi Ang who had followed Lou Mu Yan in squeezing through couldn't help but cut in.The look on the man's face was even more impatient, and he said with a very bad tone: \u201cI've said it many times. I can feel that this stone's extraordinary, so I want to trade it. You can believe it or not. If you want to trade, then stay, if you don't, then put the stone back and get lost.\u201dIf it weren't that a Spiritual Treasure he was refining required a high-level Demonic Beast skin, he wouldn't take out these materials that were used for Smithing to trade. Especially the dark grey stone. It always gave him a mysterious and unpredictable feel. These ignorant people asking these questions really made him annoyed.\u201cWhat's with your attitude? You\u2026\u201d Xiao Zi Ang wanted to say more, but Lou Mu Yan turned her head to stop him with her gaze.\u201cI want your pile of Crystals.\u201d Lou Mu Yan played with the dark grey stone in one hand, and with the other, she pointed to the pile of Crystals of varying colours on the table.\u201c\u2026\u201d Xiao Zi Ang glared at Lou Mu Yan speechlessly\u2014this woman was truly a prodigal lady.Hearing Lou Mu Yan's words, the middle-aged man thought she just wanted to buy the Crystals on the table like the people before, so he said with a poor attitude: \u201cI don't sell individual Crystals. If you want it, you need to trade me a Tier 5 Demonic Beast skin. I only sell the stone you're holding.\u201dLou Mu Yan wasn't angry at the man's attitude. Having to consistently repeat things he had been saying was frustrating for sure. She chuckled and nodded casually: \u201cI only want the Crystals on your table, but since you want to sell it like that, that's fine. I'll trade.\u201dHearing Lou Mu Yan's words, the man raised his head and looked at her squarely, with a hint of brilliance in his eyes. It wasn't the brilliance of seeing a beauty, but it was the excitement of obtaining a Demonic Beast skin he wanted.\u201cThen give me a Tier 5 Demonic Beast skin. Preferably fire attribute.\u201d The man said with a rare, pleasant tone.The corner of Lou Mu Yan's eyes twitched. This man sure had many demands. However, a Smith having a strange temperament was normal. After all, having to deal with fire day in day out, fire poison would accumulate in their body, which naturally meant it would affect their temperament. Therefore, many Smiths were very irritable.\u201cEldest brother, contribute a Tier 5 Demonic Beast for use.\u201d Lou Mu Yan knew that Lou Mu Bai had the corpse of a Tier 5 Demonic Beast, so she asked with a big smile.Lou Mu Bai didn't know why his younger sister wanted this pile of Crystals. He felt that she cared more about the grey stone in her hand, but he was unconditional in pampering his younger sister, so he took out a Tier 5 Water Crocodile's corpse and said, \u201cI don't have a fire attribute Demonic Beast corpse, only a water attribute corpse.\u201dThe middle-aged man looked at the corpse of the Water Crocodile on the floor with furrowed brows. His eyes revealed a bit of conflicting emotions. If the Spirit Treasure he refined could obtain a fire attribute Demonic Beast skin, then it could be even better, but materials were scarce right now, so he could only make do.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksJust when the middle-aged man wanted to agree, a female's voice rang from the crowd.\u201cThis Young Miss wants that pile of Crystals and that dark grey stone.\u201dThen, everyone saw a tender and beautiful woman in a red dress with an arrogant and domineering attitude walk towards them after leading a few people to drive the onlookers away.\u201cYou have a Tier 5 fire attribute Demonic Beast skin?\u201d The middle-aged man retracted his gaze on the Water Crocodile and looked up at the woman who opened her mouth. If he could have a fire attribute Demonic Beast's armour, then he would naturally choose something more beneficial to him.\u201cOf course.\u201d The woman raised her chin proudly.\u201cHey, aren't you too unfair. Obviously this was something we ordered first, and we already gave you the Demonic Beast's corpse, but you actually want to back out.\u201d Xiao Zi Ang had long felt that the middle-aged man was unpleasant, and now he was angered. This man with no ethics was just too classless.The middle-aged man glanced at Xiao Zi Ang and said: \u201cDidn't we just fail the transaction? I need fire attribute materials. Now that there is, why should I choose the water attribute Demonic Beast skin that I could just barely use?\u201cOf course, I, Huo Xiao, am not a villain. I'll compensate you with some Crystals for free in a bit.\u201d He indeed went back on his word, so it was nothing to compensate some Crystals to these little children.When Lou Mu Yan heard Huo Xiao's words, a look of surprise flashed across her eyes, then she had a plan in her heart.\u201cTake out the skin of your fire attribute Tier 5 Demonic Beast for a look.\u201d Huo Xiao turned his head to the red-clothed woman and said with an attitude that didn't appear too enthusiastic.With a thought, a fire-attribute Crimson Fox appeared on the ground.Huo Xiao crouched down and took a look. The Crimson Fox was a bit small but given that the Demonic Skin was of the fire attribute, it was more suitable for him than the Water Crocodile.\u201cCan you still take out a fire-attribute Demonic Beast skin? If you can't, then I'll trade with her.\u201d Huo Xiao was actually not that satisfied with the Crimson Fox as he wanted a scaled Demonic Beast, so he looked at Lou Mu Yan and asked, though rather hopelessly.\u201cPfft!\u201d The red-clothed woman sneered, with disdain in her eyes: \u201cIf she could take it out, she would've taken it out a long time ago. Isn't it unnecessary to ask?\u201dThe woman in red looked askance at Lou Mu Yan, and when she moved her gaze to the white Demonic Beast she was holding, an understanding flashed across her eyes.She also decided to buy the pile of Crystals and that inconspicuous dark grey rock because the Fire Cloud Mink in her Spirit Pet Bangle called attention to it. Although she didn't know what sort of rock it was, but she knew that sometimes the more inconspicuous something was, the more of a treasure it was.\u201cYou, hurry up and bring that grey rock over.\u201d Xin Ying Xuan, the woman in red, pointed her finger at Lou Mu Yan with slight contempt on her face.Lou Mu Yan's eyes turned cold. She hated other people pointing their fingers at her the most. She noted this arrogant and cocky woman down.\u201cWho said I don't want it anymore?\u201d Lou Mu Yan shook the rock in between her two fingers in front of the crowd, and said lazily, \u201cToday, I'm definitely taking this!\u201d\u201cYour tone sure isn't soft. If you take out an even higher-level fire attribute Demonic Beast corpse, then why shouldn't this Young Miss let you.\u201d Xin Ying Xuan's eyes were full of disdain.Note: Hehe, yes, yes, a higher-level fire attribute Demonic Beast\u2026 I wonder what she can take out\u2026 hahahaNote: What a caring elder brother Lou Mu Bai is!!! Love the sibling relationships in this novel tbh. Too many back-stabbing siblings in other novels >.> Also loving the familial relationships too. We need more healthier sibling relationships in c-novels.Edit: Oops, accidentally published this one early. Just to clarify, there won't be a second chapter today, I just accidentally scheduled the time wrong hahaha.

    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 68: Am I a Foolish\u00a0Spender?Even she only owned this one Tier 5 Demonic Beast corpse, so she didn't believe at all that this woman in front of her could take out the corpse of a Tier 6 Demonic Beast.\u201cLet me? Do I need you to let me?\u201d Lou Mu Yan raised her eyebrow and sneered.\u201cYou really have the skin of a fire attribute Demonic Beast? You better not be teasing me?\u201d Huo Xiao's eyes lit up, but his voice carried a sense of warning. His good attitude today was almost worn out, so he hoped that this woman wasn't playing him.Xin Ying Xuan snorted coldly: \u201cThen take it out. You can't trade by just talking about it.\u201dShe hated women who were more beautiful than herself. So looking at the woman in front of her who was a beauty that could cause the collapse of a country, that appeared indolent, and had a clever temperament, she hated her even more in her heart.The surrounding crowd didn't believe that Lou Mu Yan could take out an even higher-level fire-attribute Demonic Beast. After all, a Tier 5 Demonic Beast that represented a Sword Spirit Stage Sword Master was already difficult to kill, let alone a Tier 6 Demonic Beast equivalent to the strength of a Sword Monarch. For this woman who appeared to not have a strong cultivation base, she was probably only taking nonsense and causing dispute for her personal feelings.So some people yelled in agreement, \u201cThat's right, take it out and let's see. Do you think that high-level Demonic Beasts are like cabbages that're all over the street!\u201d\u201cLet's not talk about a higher-level Demonic Beast, I'm afraid that she couldn't even take out another Tier 5 fire attribute Demonic Beast's corpse.\u201cThat's right, she even asked her elder brother for the Water Crocodile just now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d For a moment, the surroundings became livelier.Xin Ying Xuan hugged her arms, displaying a high, arrogant posture, certain that Lou Mu Yan couldn't take out the skin of a fire attribute Demonic Beast.Lou Mu Bai furrowed his brows and looked a Xin Ying Xuan. He had already guessed her identity in his heart, but he didn't object to his younger sister going against her.As for Yun Lan and the others, they only had curiosity in their hearts. Lu Mu Yan had given them too many surprises, and this time, they also inexplicably believed that she wasn't just talking irresponsibly. But how did she obtain a Demonic Beast corpse with the strength equivalent to that of a Sword Monarch? The Lou Clan didn't have any Sword Monarch experts at all.Lou Mu Yan didn't care about the discussions occurring about her. She originally had some uses for the Tier 6 Flame Unicorn Beast's corpse, but she could only give it up for the rock that Mo Yan wanted. However, taking advantage of her wasn't that easy.With a thought, she moved the corpse of the Flame Unicorn Beast that Ming Xiu had killed onto the ground, but she had already taken away its blood essence and its horn a long time ago.A pressuring fire attribute Demonic Beast's aura spread throughout the air. The Flame Unicorn Beast died not long ago, so the heavy pressure of a high-level Demonic Beast had yet to dissipate, though it had been weakened. However, it still caused the people around them to pale with fright.\u201cWhat? It's actually a Flame Unicorn Beast of Peak-Phase Tier 6 strength.\u201d Those who came to explore the Glacial Mountain Range wouldn't be that weak, so someone in the crowd recognised the corpse of the Demonic Beast on the ground.\u201cA Flame Unicorn of Peak-Phase Tier 6 strength? No way, that's equivalent to the strength of a Sword Sovereign expert!\u201d\u201cMy eyes aren't blurry are they? To be able to see a Tier 6 Flame Unicorn Beast in my living years, it truly was worthwhile to come!\u201dMeanwhile, Huo Xiao's eyes stared, transfixed, on the corpse of the Demonic Beast, his body slightly trembling. The burning desire and excitement in his eyes formed a great contrast to his coldness earlier.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksHe eagerly walked to the Flame Unicorn Beast's corpse and squatted down. He stroked it a few times with his shaking hands, as if cherishing a prized work of art. This was the best material for refining Magic Tools he had come across in his entire life.Xin Ying Xuan also revealed a look of disbelief. She naturally knew what sort of existence the Tier 6 Flame Unicorn Beast was. She looked at Lou Mu Yan, who was calm and composed, with confliction in her eyes. She was confused\u2014what exactly was the origin of this woman?She was the Young Miss, born from the main wife, raised by the Xin Clan, one of the Ten Distinguished Clans in the Eastern Region. She had the capital to be arrogant, but she wasn't stupid. Until she knew the identity of the woman opposite her, she wouldn't do anything against her on the surface for the time being.She sure didn't want to offend a stronger force than the Xin Clan for a mysterious stone. Of course, if this woman had an average background, then she'd remember today's grievances of her taking the rock, and eventually find this woman to make her repay.Not only were the outsiders stupefied, but even Yun Lan and the others were shocked.What was happening here? How could Lou Mu Yan possess the corpse of a Flame Unicorn Beast equivalent to the strength of a Sword Sovereign?This Flame Unicorn Beast was of a superior Demonic Beast species. The skin of its entire body was composed of pieces of fire attribute scales. It could be said that its defence was abnormal amongst Demonic Beasts, and its ability to escape was also extremely strong. Even a Sword Sovereign expert might not be able to kill it.The strongest person's cultivation base in Yan'zhou Kingdom was only the Sword Sovereign Ancestor of the Imperial Family that had long gone into Closed-Door Cultivation. The other distinguished clans and noble families had no Sword Sovereign experts, and the Lou Clan behind Lou Mu Yan didn't even have a Sword Monarch expert. So how did she obtain such a super high-level Demonic Beast corpse?It simply didn't make sense, didn't make sense at all! They couldn't see through Lou Mu Yan more and more. Luckily they all had a very good heart, otherwise, with the way this woman was constantly stimulating them from time to time, they would be stimulated to the point they might even fall ill.\u201cHave you touched it enough?\u201d Seeing Huo Xiao's appearance as if he was some inexperienced person, Lou Mu Yan's mouth twitched. This man was at least a Smith that wasn't at that low of a level, yet now that he saw a Flame Unicorn Beast, his eyeballs appeared as if it wanted to be glued to the Demonic Beast's corpse.Huo Xiao swallowed, raised his head with excitement and pointed to the Crystals on the table, saying: \u201cI'll trade. You can take all of these things. I'll trade with you.\u201d\u201cWait. Don't be so hasty yet. I didn't say that I'd use the entire Flame Unicorn Beast's corpse to exchange for whatever this rock is. As for those Crystals, it's even less worth it.\u201d Lou Mu Yan raised her eyebrow, took the dark grey rock, and threw it up and down in her hand casually, with a look as if saying 'it's not like I'm an idiot'.All the people present didn't feel as if there was anything wrong with her attitude. Instead, this woman was truly a prodigal. With the corpse of this Demonic Beast, even if it were a few scales, it'd be much more valuable than that rock. They really didn't know what sort of brain circuit this girl had to actually be willing to use it to trade.\u201cWhat do you mean? Just tell me directly, what do you want to do? I want this Demonic Beast corpse.\u201d Huo Xiao blocked the Flame Unicorn Beast's corpse with half his body as if a wolf defending its food. This kind of high-level Smithing material was superb. Whether he'd be able to chance upon something like this again in the future was uncertain, so he sure didn't want to miss this chance.\u201cWhat do I mean? You tell me. Can you compare this Tier 6 Flame Unicorn Beast to the value of this ugly rock and that pile of Crystals?\u201d Lou Mu Yan asked instead. She had her own plans, and she wanted Huo Xiao to walk right into the trap she designed herself.Huo Xiao wasn't scheming, and his temperament was relatively straightforward. So after hearing Lou Mu Yan's question, he nodded honestly: \u201cIt's definitely incomparable. Your Flame Unicorn Beast is more valuable.\u201d\u201cThen am I a foolish spender? This is obviously a losing trade. Will I be that dumb and give you the entire Flame Unicorn Beast for these ugly rocks? If it were you, would you?\u201d Lou Mu Yan continued to ask.\u201cI won't.\u201d Huo Xiao shook his head and added silently in his heart 'only an idiot will'. But right now, he sure hoped that this woman before him was an idiot\u2026The surrounding crowd couldn't help but roll their eyes upon hearing Lou Mu Yan ask this question. If you're not a foolish spender, nor an idiot, then would you take out such a precious Flame Unicorn Beast corpse to trade for a random, ugly stone?Xiao Xi Ang was even more speechless and murmured beneath his breath: \u201cProdigal lady, she's really a prodigal lady!\u201dNote: Welp, what a reason for Xin Ying Xuan to hate Lou Mu Yan\u2014for her beauty\u2026 But then I continued translating and realised she wasn't the idiot I thought she was gonna be HAHAHA I've read too many cultivation novels with stupid young masters and young misses that just up and go 'you're courting death' that I thought that was where this was going HAHAHA. But the Xin Clan\u2026 Still an enemy regardless. Man it really is like I'm reading this novel for the first time LOLPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 69: Forge a\u00a0FeudLou Mu Yan was satisfied that Huo Xiao had followed the direction her words wanted to take him.Seeing that almost all the people around them looked at her with the same 'you're a fool' look, her lips rose into a meaningful smile.These people didn't know the value of the dark grey stone. If they knew, they'd find that the corpse of a Flame Unicorn Beast couldn't be compared to it. But she definitely wasn't kind enough to explain the wonders of this stone's use.\u201cAlright, I won't make a fuss about how you changed your mind previously. So I'll use one-fifth of the Flame Unicorn Beast's corpse to exchange for this stone and those Crystals.\u201d Lou Mu Yan kept holding the rock in her hand. On the surface, she appeared as if she didn't care, but she was actually afraid of it being snatched by others.\u201cOne-fifth? That's a little too less.\u201d Huo Xiao's eyes widened. After seeing an entire Flame Unicorn Beast, how could he bear to give it up.Lou Mu Yan chuckled softly, smiling exceptionally radiantly, \u201cOne-fifth is already a lot. One-fifth of the corpse of my Flame Unicorn Beast is already larger than that Crimson Fox. Speaking of, it seems I'm the one that's suffering a loss.\u201cOf course, if you feel that you're suffering a loss, then I'm too lazy to bother with you anymore. Just go trade with that Young Miss.\u201d Lou Mu Yan displayed a nonchalant and indifferent gesture, throwing the dark grey stone she was playing with back to Huo Xiao.Huo Xiao suddenly felt that the stone that he previously considered a treasure had become a burning problem. In terms of size and value, one-fifth of the corpse of the Flame Unicorn Beast from this purple-clothed woman was indeed far better than the red-clothed woman's Crimson Fox.How could one choose copper coins after seeing gold coins? He wasn't that stupid to lose something big because of something small.But this woman sure remembered her grudges well\u2014she still remembered how he wanted to back out earlier.\u201cCan we discuss it a bit more? You can use one-fifth of the Flame Unicorn Beast's corpse to trade for my stone and the Crystals, but I want to discuss with you about the remainder of the corpse.\u201d Huo Xiao pondered deeply, then decided that he would take out all the good things he had accumulated to see if he could trade them for the entire Flame Unicorn Beast's corpse from this woman.Lou Mu Yan raised an eyebrow as she stroked her chin under Huo Xiao's nervous gaze, then said leisurely after a while of silence: \u201cI'm in a good mood today, so discussing with you is fine. But this isn't the place to talk.\u201d\u201cNo worries, we'll go wherever you think is appropriate.\u201d Huo Xiao's face brightened and said with haste and urgency. As long as she was willing to talk, then there was still a chance.Lou Mu Yan glanced at him with disdain, put away the Flame Unicorn Beast on the ground, then nodded and said: \u201cThen let's go.\u201dHuo Xiao packed away all the Crystals from the stall, thought a little, then stuffed the dark grey stone quickly into Lou Mu Yan's hands, as if afraid she would go back on her words, \u201cThis stone's counted as a deposit, you take it first.\u201d\u201cAren't you afraid of me running away with it?\u201d Lou Mu Yan concealed the smile in her eyes\u2014everything was under her control.\u201cWhy should I be afraid? I absolutely believe in your credibility, Miss.\u201d Huo Xiao's unshaven face pulled a smile that he thought was very sincere.He had never done such condescending things in his life, but for the Flame Unicorn Beast's corpse, he'd bear it.Lou Mu Yan took the stone slowly and nodded: \u201cAlright. I'll temporarily accept this stone since you're pleasing to the eye. I'll return it if we don't come to an agreement.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The others that heard this were completely speechless. Where was this stall owner pleasing to the eye? He had such a sloppy look, with clothes stained with soil.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksIt seemed that she wasn't only just a foolish spender, but her eyes weren't good either.\u201cOf course we'll agree, how could we not come to an agreement?' Huo Xiao said immediately. Even if he couldn't get the remaining Flame Unicorn Beast's corpse, he'd still take that one-fifth.\u201cThen are you still going to trade with another? That Young Miss is still waiting for your reply.\u201d Lou Mu Yan looked at Xin Ying Xuan who had a grim expression, and asked Huo Xiao with a smile.She was very vengeful. She still remembered how this woman wanted to snatch her things arrogantly just now and also her act of pointing her finger at her. Not to mention she had a feeling that in the future, she'd inevitably forge a huge feud with the woman. Since that was the case, then it didn't hurt to offend her more right now.Her intuition had always been rather accurate, and because of this keen sense of foresight, she had escaped numerous catastrophes before.\u201cYoung Miss, please put your Crimson Fox away now. She indeed took out a corpse of a Demonic Beast that was higher in Tier than yours, so you didn't lose unjustly.\u201d Huo Xiao pointed to the Crimson Fox's corpse on the ground and there was some irreverence in his eyes.Xin Ying Xuan took a deep breath and suppressed the anger in her heart. She glanced at Lou Mu Yan with an obscure, cold look, put away the Crimson Fox, then quickly left with the people she brought.After leaving the markets, Xin Ying Xuan's face was as grim as ink, and she ordered a man beside her, \u201cGo and investigate that woman.\u201dA viciousness flashed past in her eyes. If that woman's background was stronger than hers, then she'd swallow this for the time being, but if that woman was just a small clan's pupil, then she'd slowly play her to death.\u201cYes, Third Young Miss.\u201dLou Mu Yan looked thoughtfully in the direction Xin Ying Xuan left and was even more determined to find the Deep Orchid in the Glacial Mountain Range. She must quickly refine the Foundation Establishment Pill and improve her strength.After leaving the free trade zone, Lou Mu Yan smiled and asked the others: \u201cHow about we go to the commercial stores to have a look.\u201d She wanted to collect more Spiritual Herbs in case of any emergency in the future.\u201cLittle sister has the say.\u201d Lou Mu Bai's indifferent eyes displayed a bit of pampering. He wouldn't ask Lou Mu Yan where she obtained the Flame Unicorn Beast. As long as his younger sister was fine, then he'd be satisfied.Yun Lan and the others wanted to go to the commercial area to have a look to begin with, so they naturally wouldn't refuse. Only Huo Xiao looked miserable, but he didn't dare to offend this little grandaunt1\u00a0before him, so he could only tag along with them.After the few people left, the crowd of onlookers gradually dispersed. Some of them also secretly ordered others to investigate Lou Mu Yan's background.Truth be told, Lou Mu Yan didn't really want to take out the corpse of the Flame Unicorn Beast to trade with Huo Xiao so ostentatiously. Except, after that woman interfered, and for Mo Yan's need of that stone, she could only show off a little.As for the consequences of taking out the Flame Unicorn Beast, she had already thought about it. The Marrow Cleansing Pill had already been known to everyone\u2014didn't she have a mysterious Master? It didn't matter to put more responsibility onto her 'Master'. She believed that those people who secretly investigated her would definitely attribute her possession of the Flame Unicorn Beast to that Master.Speaking of 'Master', Ming Xiu's figure suddenly flashed through Lou Mu Yan's mind. Her lips raised in a merry arc. Who knew what that devilish man's reaction would be if he knew that she traded the Flame Unicorn Beast so casually?She reached out her hand and rubbed the ice bangle on her wrist. This bangle truly gave her a weird feeling. There seemed to be a sliver of connection between her and it, yet it also seemed that there was none, drawing them together yet not quite.This ice bangle was definitely extraordinary, but she hadn't found the trick to unseal it, or maybe she couldn't establish a deeper connection because she was still too weak.If she could meet Ming Xiu again, she could definitely ask him. She always had a feeling of spiritual harmony with this ice bangle, so she really wanted to know its secret.1often said in verbal fights my female who would refer to themselves as 'grandaunt' (\u59d1\u5976\u5976) to show dominance. Just like how in Chinese, some men would say 'I'm your old man/father' or 'I'm your grandfather' to show dominance in a verbal fight. Likewise females might also say 'I'm your mother'. 'You're my grandson/You're a grandson' is also an insult, because it calls them weak.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 70: The Ye Qing Han That Yun Lan Spoke\u00a0OfOnce one saw a row of shops side by side after passing through the other path of the markets, one would see that there were still people coming and going, but there were less hawking and trading.Lou Mu Yan and the rest walked slowly along from the first shop. When she saw things that she wanted, even if the price wasn't considered low, she would still buy them without hesitation, which made others inwardly scream that she was too prodigal.However, remembering that she not only had the huge sum of money she obtained from auctioning off the Marrow Cleansing Pill last time, but she also currently had a Flame Unicorn Beast's corpse with value not lower than the Marrow Cleansing Pill, they began to feel more at ease\u2014she indeed had the capital to be prodigal.Xiao Zi Ang and Yun Jin exchanged looks and couldn't help but sigh with emotion\u2014comparing oneself to another could definitely infuriate oneself to death.\u201cDoes Mu Yan know who the girl who fought with you for the stone is?\u201d Yun Lan walked beside Lou Mu Yan and asked with worry in his voice.The moment Lou Mu Yan heard his tone, she guessed that he definitely knew, so she smiled indicatively and asked: \u201cI don't really know, but it seems that cousin knows?\u201d\u201cShe's from one of the Ten Distinguished Clans of the Eastern Region, the Xin Clan's Third Young Miss and the daughter of the main wife, Xin Ying Xuan. Because her talents were exceptional, so she's highly valued by the Xin Clan.\u201d Yun Lan paused, then added: \u201cShe's arrogant and ostentatious, and easily holds grudges. After you snatched what she wanted just now, I'm afraid she already ordered people to investigate your background.\u201dArrogant and ostentatious? Lou Mu Yan's star-like black eyes revealed some nostalgia. The her back when she was in the Spiritual World was what was considered true arrogance and ostentatious behaviour. How could Xin Ying Xuan's restricted arrogance compare? However, that woman definitely wasn't an idiot, so it was best to guard against her in the future.\u201cXin Clan? Is it one of the Ten Distinguished Clans like maternal grandpa's Ling Clan?\u201d Speaking of the Xin Clan, Lou Mu Yan remembered what her mother said that day. Wasn't Xin Clan one of the main clans that dropped stones on the Ling Clan who had fallen into a well1\u00a0and suppressed them on purpose?Yun Lan nodded: \u201cThat's right. But now, because Xin Ying Xuan's father had advanced to a Sword Sovereign expert, plus the plundering of the Ling Clan's resources over the recent years, the Xin Clan's ranking already leapt to number five among the Ten Distinguished Clans.\u201dThe Ling Clan was Lou Mu Yan's maternal grandfather's family, so he didn't want to conceal anything from her. The main reason that he didn't stop Lou Mu Yan, even though he clearly knew that Xin Ying Xuan wasn't someone they should offend, was because the two were bound to become enemies due to their Clans.\u201cStepping on the Ling Clan to climb to the top, it must taste great. Let's just let them enjoy the satisfaction of standing on high grounds a little longer.\u201d Lou Mu Yan's eyes were full of coldness. Wasn't falling from a high place even worse?No wonder when she first met Xin Ying Xuan earlier, she had a premonition that she would forge a great feud with her. So it was because their identities already determined that they would become enemies.\u201cHow's the relationship between Xin Ying Xuan and Xue Ling?\u201d Lou Mu Yan asked, raising her eyes to look at Yun Lan.The situations concerning the Ten Distinguished Clans couldn't be obtained through investigations, and the General's Mansion didn't know much either, so only someone like Yun Lan, a child who was highly valued by the Imperial Family, could possibly know something.\u201cThe Xin Clan and the Xue Clan have secretly cooperated for many years and their relationship's very good, but despite both being the daughter of the main wife, with excelling talents in their respective families, their relationship isn't compatible, to the point it was as if they were like fire and water, and they even clashed a few times.\u201dYun Lan naturally knew about how Xue Ling had annulled the engagement with Ling Fei Yang and considered Xue Ling to be very lowly in his eyes.\u201cThey're both women favoured by the Heavens, so they'll definitely always compare themselves to the other, so it's natural they didn't like each other.\u201d Lou Mu Yan shrugged her shoulders with a smile.She only came into contact with Xin Ying Xuan for a short moment just now, but it wasn't hard to see that within the woman's arrogance, there carried a sense of viciousness. With such a temperament, it was natural that she didn't get along with a person she compared herself to, like Xue Lin, who was also a woman favoured by the Heavens.\u201cNot only did they clash because of this, but I've heard that they even secretly fought for the sake of a man.\u201d Yun Lan revealed a rare look of interest in gossip.Lou Mu Yan didn't think that the two had such a grudge against each other and was slightly curious about what sort of man was able to make the two of them scramble for him, completely disregarding their own face, \u201cFought for a man? Who?\u201d\u201cNumber two of the Ten Distinguished Clans, the Ye Clan's Young Lord, Ye Qing Han.\u201d When Yun Lan mentioned the name 'Ye Qing Han', a slight smile flashed through his eyes.\u201cPU! Ye Qing Han?\u201d Lou Mu Yan couldn't help but laugh aloud. She really couldn't imagine Ye Ying Han being fought over by two women.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksShe believed that such an image was just\u00a0too beautiful\u00a0that she simply couldn't bear to look directly at it2.\u201cWhat's wrong?\u201d Yun Lan was a little surprised and confused by Lou Mu Yan's reaction.Lou Mu Yan held back her gloating smile and shook her head: \u201cNothing. Then did Ye Qing Han choose one of the two?\u201d\u201cOf course he didn't. Ye Qing Han's eyes aren't that bad.\u201d Yun Lan's tone was definitive.Lou Mu Yan discovered that when Yun Lan mentioned Ye Qing Han, there was an indescribable emotion in his words. It wasn't like speaking of an enemy, but it wasn't like a friend either, \u201cDo you know Ye Qing Han? You believe his eyesight this much?\u201d\u201cI've met him a few times before. He's always been a person I wanted to surpass.\u201d Yun Lan smiled softly.He was defeated by Ye Qing Han twice, and was unhappy within, but he had the determination to surpass that person.\u201cPerson you want to surpass? You sure think highly of him.\u201d Speaking of Ye Qing Han, Lou Mu Yan also unconsciously revealed slight warmth in her eyes\u2014it could be considered that he was the first friend she made after coming to this world.Yun Lan nodded with a smile: \u201cThat's right. He's a very good virtual opponent3. His talent is definitely stronger than your elder brother and not weaker.\u201dHearing Yun Lan think so highly of Ye Qing Yan, Lou Mu Yan nodded. Last time at the Blazing Mountain Range, she was certain Ye Qing Han still concealed quite a bit of his strength. Ye Qing Han definitely would participate in the competition to vie for one of the quotas between the Ten Distinguished Clans, so they would most likely meet in the Glacial Mountain Range. She guessed that the Ye Qing Yan, after taking the Marrow Cleansing Pill, should've already broken through to the strength of a Sword King.\u201cWhat're you two muttering there about?\u201d Xiao Zi Ang walked over beside the two and said as he looked at Lou Mu Yan: \u201cCome and see what you think about this Spiritual Herb?\u201dEver since Xiao Zi Ang knew that Lou Mu Yan was a Grade 1 Alchemist and had a powerful Alchemist Master, his attitude towards her had improved. It wasn't because of the Master behind her, but it was simply because it felt as if they were like-minded people.Lou Mu Yan didn't dislike people like Xiao Zi Ang who was straightforward and crude as she followed him to the counter to choose a few Spiritual Herbs.Then they wandered around all the shops, but they didn't gain as much as they did in the free trade zone. Although Lou Mu Yan did manage to buy a few Spiritual Herbs required for some pills, but she didn't meet any previous, high-level Spiritual Herbs.After exiting the markets, and after Lou Mu Yan and Yun Lan discussed the promised alliance with each other in the Glacial Mountain Range, Lou Mu Yan took Huo Xiao and left with Lou Mu Bai.Chi Yi Xuan didn't thicken his face and follow. He also knew that Lou Mu Yan had things to discuss with Huo Xiao and it was inconvenient for him to interfere.Chi Yi Xuan had a fairly good relationship with Yun Lan and the others, so he was also invited to be a part of the alliance. After parting ways with Lou Mu Yan, he went to the inn where Yun Jin and the others stayed to discuss the matter of the alliance.Except the bitterness in his heart only grew stronger. He clenched his fists tightly. When facing Lou Mu Yan who was becoming more and more outstanding, he began to feel pressured.Regardless, the most important thing right now was to improve his strength and take a Trial place for himself. He was only qualified to have Lou Mu Yan if he was stronger than her.1idiom meaning to hit a person when they're down.2It's sarcastic, just in case people didn't catch up on that but I think I made it clear XD. Yes, yes, indeed, it will simply be\u00a0too beautiful\u00a0to look at.3he means that when he cultivates and trains, he can imagine Ye Qing Han as an opponent and imagine battling him to improve himself. So kinda virtual.Random note: Somewhat questionable thought at the end there, Chi Yi Xuan, but eh, typical you. Good luck with that XD.Here's the chapter, better late than never~!

    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 71: Lead Huo Xiao by the\u00a0NoseLou Mu Yan took Huo Xiao to the inn where the Academy's students stayed, found a vacant room, and set up a soundproof Array.Then she took out a pot of Spiritual Tea and poured a cup for Lou Mu Bai and Huo Xiao each.After passing the teacup to Huo Xiao, she asked him: \u201cWhat's your name?\u201d\u201cHuo Xiao.\u201d Huo Xiao stared at the golden, rich, and fragrant Spiritual Tea, held it to the tip of his nose and sniffed with an intoxicated expression, taking a sip as if it simply wasn't enough, \u201cGreat tea!\u201dThe corner of Lou Mu Yan's mouth couldn't help but twitch upon seeing Huo Xiao look as if he had never seen anything good in his entire life. Didn't they say Smithing and Alchemy were extremely wealthy professions? How could this person look as if he had never seen this world before?\u201cHow old are you.\u201d\u201cThirty-six.\u201d Huo Xiao sipped the Spiritual Tea in small mouthfuls while answering the boring questions posed by the woman opposite.Lou Mu Yan looked at him from head to toe\u2014his hair was loose and untamed, covering most of his face, was dressed in sloppy clothes, and there was even some dirt on this man's body. With such a rough appearance, he didn't look like he had the vitality a thirty something year old man should have.Huo Xiao also noticed the woman's look of disapproval, looked down at his clothes, then laughed dryly: \u201cI was refining a Spirit Treasure, and when I came out of my workshop, I ran straight to the market to set up a stall, so I didn't fix myself.\u201dLou Mu Yan nodded and continued to ask: \u201cYou're a Grade 3 Smith right?\u201d\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Huo Xiao, who was drinking tea, raised his head suddenly and looked at Lou Mu Yan in surprise and confusion.He only broke through to a Grade 3 Smith last month. No one else knew about this, so how did this woman discover it?\u201cOf course it's because I could see it.\u201d Lou Mu Yan smiled beautifully, and inadvertently revealed a confident look.Huo Xiao looked at the confident and lively woman opposite and furrowed his brows, \u201cImpossible. The level of a Smith couldn't be seen like someone's cultivation base. I don't believe it.\u201d\u201cIs there a very faint black line on your left middle finger?\u201d Lou Mu Yan asked instead of answering.Huo Xiao immediately stretched out his left hand. Upon closer inspection, he discovered that there was indeed a black line connecting his palm to the middle finger of his hand, extending towards the first joint line. Shocked, he looked up at Lou Mu Yan and asked: \u201cI'm poisoned?\u201dLou Mu Yan rolled her eyes at him and said with disapproval: \u201cIt's truly terrifying to be uncultured. As a Smith, don't you know what Fire Poison is?\u201dAlthough Smiths and Alchemists both often come into contact with fire, but because the Spiritual Herbs that Alchemists refine naturally offset the toxins in the fire, so one wouldn't easily become poisoned by Fire Poison. Even if there was Fire Poison left in the body, it could be cured by a pill.Meanwhile, Smiths were frequently required to refine some Spars1\u00a0or Demonic Beast skins, and fire is often used during the refining process. So the Elemental Energy flame would absorb the residual poison of those materials, which will eventually become fire poison deposited in the body.If one left it for a long time, it would bring hidden dangers to the body, and even cause death by poisoning.Huo Xiao wasn't a stupid person either. After hearing Lou Mu Yan's words, he asked: \u201cYou're saying that this black line is produced by the Fire Poison that's deposited in my body from refining Magic Tools? You judged that I'm a Grade 3 Smith based on this?\u201d\u201cYep, it seems you aren't that stupid.\u201d Lou Mu Yan chuckled, \u201cIf the Fire Poison accumulated in a Grade 2 Alchemist isn't removed, then a faint black line would slowly appear on the left middle finger. After advancing to a Grade 3 Smith, if the Fire Poison isn't removed, then the black like would extend to the first joint line of the middle finger.\u201d\u201cWhat about those above Grade 3?\u201d Huo Xiao asked hurriedly.\u201cThe faint black line would darken in colour for those above Grade 3 and slowly extend upward. After reaching a Grade 4 Smith, if the Fire Poison still hasn't been removed, then the black line will extend directly to the nail.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksLou Mu Yan picked up the teacup and sipped it softly. Then she raised her eyes and smiled indicatively, saying: \u201cIf the black line extends to the position of the nail, it also means that the person's life is coming to an end.\u201dHuo Xiao's face stiffened. He had heard about Fire Poison being harmful, but he didn't expect that it was this dangerous. He could judge that the woman sitting opposite wasn't exaggerating to scare him, but how did she know?He leaned forward a little and the faint fragrance of medicine on the opposite person's body penetrated his nose. He looked at Lou Mu Yan with a smile in his eyes and asked: \u201cYou're a Physician or Alchemist?\u201d\u201cDoes it have anything to do with you whether I am or not?\u201d Lou Mu Yan covered her nose and backed into her chair, then said with furrowed brows: \u201cStay away from me, the sour smell on your body is really too much.\u201dHuo Xiao stretched his sleeves to his nose, smelled it, and there was indeed an unpleasant sour smell. He smiled awkwardly: \u201cI was leaving in a hurry and didn't get time to wash up. I'll go wash up tonight.\u201d\u201cYou really should wash yourself well.\u201d Lou Mu Yan displayed some approval in her eyes.Lou Mu Yan didn't want to talk about being an Alchemist, so Huo Xiao didn't ask anymore. He sat upright, took a few more sips of tea and continued speaking after falling silent for a while: \u201cLet's talk about the corpse of the Flame Unicorn Beast.\u201d\u201cSure. Do you want a whole Flame Unicorn Beast?\u201d Lou Mu Yan asked, raising the corner of her lips.\u201cOf course I do.\u201d Huo Xiao nodded. The Flame Unicorn Beast was the best refining material he had ever seen in his life, and it perfectly fitted the main material he had desperately imagined, for a long time, to use to refine a Spirit Treasure with.\u201cThen show some sincerity. What would you give in exchange?\u201d Lou Mu Yan stroked the rim of the cup, her voice a little sharp.Huo Xiao gritted his teeth and moved all the valuables he had from his interspatial ring to the tabletop, then said: \u201cThese are all the good things I have with me. You can pick whatever you want yourself.\u201dLou Mu Yan glanced at the things on the table, most of which were Spar materials for Smithing, and Spirit Tools, Spirit Treasures.\u201cI've got no interest in these things on the table.\u201dA look of disappointment flashed across Huo Xiao's eyes. Although Smithing was a very profitable profession, but it also consumed a vast amount of money. In order to advance to a Grade 3 Smith, most of his savings were spent on buying materials for refining to break through, so he really couldn't take out anything good to trade.But he eagerly wanted the corpse of the Flame Unicorn Beast, so he said: \u201cTell me, what should I do so that you'd give me the entire Flame Unicorn Beast corpse?\u201cOh yeah, how about I'll provide all the Spirit Treasures you want in the future, but the rare and hard-to-find materials need to be provided by you.\u201d Huo Xiao added. He believed that no one could reject such a promise from a Grade 3 Smith.Lou Mu Yan raised her eyebrow and sneered: \u201cThe Spirit Treasures you refine for me aren't even worthy to enter my eyes.\u201dWhen she was in the Spirit World, she knew how to refine Tools herself, and her level was far higher than that of Huo Xiao's, so how could she think highly of the things Huo Xiao refined. It just wasn't on the same level.Of course, a Grade 3 Smith like Huo Xiao was of little use to her, but was extremely useful to the Lou Clan, otherwise she wouldn't set up this trap for Huo Xiao to jump in willingly.Huo Xiao's confident smile immediately cracked and slight anger rose in his eyes. He slammed the table and shouted: \u201cWhat? You look down on the Spirit Treasures I refine? Do you know what kind of existence a Grade 3 Smith is?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of existence?\u201d Lou Mu Yan asked with folded arms and a smile of interest.\u201cIn the entire Eastern Region, the highest level of Smithing is only Grade 4, and there'll be no more than four people. Although there are a little more Grade 3 Smiths, but there won't be more than twenty.\u201dHuo Xiao snorted coldly, \u201cIf I go out now and join a random kingdom, force, or Clan at will, they'd all worship me as a super guest. The Magic Tools I refine would be even more desirable than that by numerous people. You tell me what kind of existence a Grade 3 Smith is?\u201dLou Mu Yan lowered her head and chuckled, then picked up a shield made by Huo Xiao on the table, and said nonchalantly: \u201cSo what about a Grade 3 Smith? There are still very big flaws in the Spirit Treasures you've refined.\u201d1changed 'Crystals' to Spar'.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 72: Take as a\u00a0MasterHearing the word 'flaw', Huo Xiao's body froze, and he looked at Lou Mu Yan with a complicated look.Smiths cherished every single Magic Tool they refined themselves. He was obsessed with Smithing, and although he had an arrogant side, he could also receive teachings with humbleness.\u201cCan you tell what sort of flaws there are on this Spirit Treasure? I'll be convinced if you can tell me.\u201dLou Mu Yan put away her smiles and her expression grew more serious, \u201cYou lacked a material when you were refining this shield and the heat in several places weren't controlled that well, so this can only count as a low-level Spirit Treasure.\u201d\u201cYou can see what materials I lacked when refining just like that?\u201d Huo Xiao looked at her incredulously. He discovered that he had belittled this woman too much before.Lou Mu Yan raised an eyebrow, \u201cHow difficult is that? What's missing is the Profound Ice Jade. The biggest flaw of your shield is that it can't withstand ice attacks. If it met a high-level Sword Master who uses ice attributes very skilfully, then your shield would become a useless burden.\u201d\u201cThen the heat in several places that weren't controlled well could also be told by looking at it?\u201d Huo Xiao asked eagerly.Since he first came into contact with Smithing, he mostly taught and explored this area by himself based on his excellent Smithing talent, so he did indeed lack some skill in controlling the heat. While refining this Spirit Treasure shield, he made three mistakes when controlling the heat, so he really wanted to hear Lou Mu Yan's opinion.Lou Mu Yan picked up the shield and turned it to the innermost side. She pointed to a dark cyan line and said: \u201cThe overall shield body is cyan in colour, but the cyan here is much darker, indicating that the firepower used during the second solidification of the shield was too strong.\u201dThen she pointed to an inconspicuous faint red light on the shield and said: \u201cWhen you added the fire attribute Spar and other materials to dissolve together, the firepower was slightly weaker, so the fusion here wasn't the best.\u201cThen look at this. The edges of the shield aren't smooth, indicating that your mentality wasn't relaxed enough when the shield was being formed. Because of your eagerness, the firepower was a bit high, which caused slight jaggedness on the side.\u201cThat's roughly about it for the problems with the heat for this shield.\u201d Lou Mu Yan took this seriously and said with a tone of disapproval, \u201cIf I were you, I wouldn't refine this shield Spirit Treasure without the Profound Ice Jade. Not only did you waste a lot of materials, but the quality of the shield was also lowered by two levels.\u201dWhen Lou Mu Yan said it so seriously, Huo Xiao's previous anger dissipated, and his eyes were full of shock.He was completely stunned by her. Her tone when speaking about Smithing were as if she were familiar with it. She must be a mid-high-level expert.So his old face blushed, \u201cMy shield was made at the time to advance to a Grade 3 Smith, and at the time I just couldn't find the Profound Ice Jade, so I made do.\u201d\u201cWhat's the purpose of advancing? Naturally it's to improve your Smithing ability.\u201dWhen Lou Mu Yan spoke about professional matters, she unconsciously displayed a natural seriousness and self-confidence, \u201cThe fundamental thing for Smiths is to refine every Magic Tool to as close to perfection as possible with their heart. You definitely can't make do. If you do that often, then how would you be able to find the perfect opportunity to breakthrough to an even higher level? You're not in the right mentality to begin with. With this, you can't go far.\u201dHuo Xiao listened carefully and discovered that Lou Mu Yan wasn't like a sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl at all right now. Instead, she felt like a veteran Smith, calm and leisurely. He couldn't help but be convinced by the words she said as well.\u201cYes, that's right. I used to be too smug.\u201d Huo Xiao nodded with enlightenment.Lou Mu Yan was right. He became a little proud and complacent ever since he broke through to a Grade 2 Smith. In order to advance to a Grade 3 Smith faster, he did give up some of the principles he used to adhere to.After being analysed so frankly by her, he felt as if he had been struck and enlightened, but at the same time, he felt fear in hindsight.If he really continued to walk on the current path, his future achievements would peak at a Grade 4 Smith, which was far from his goal.\u201cThank you Young Miss Lou for your advice. I've noted this favour.\u201d If Huo Xiao thought that Lou Mu Yan was young and frivolous before and belittled her, then he was sincerely grateful now.Lou Mu Yan was very satisfied with Huo Xiao's change. This person could still be taught, \u201cNo need. Let's continue to talk about the trade now.\u201d\u201cWait. Can I ask Young Miss Lou a question first?\u201d Huo Xiao's expression displayed a somewhat indescribable and complicated look.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksLou Mu Yan smiled yet not quite smiled at him and said: \u201cAsk.\u201d\u201cIs Young Miss Lou a Smith?\u201d\u201cI'm not quite a Smith right now.\u201d She had never refined any Magic Tools ever since coming here, so technically she still wasn't considered a Smith.Huo Xiao looked at Lou Mu Yan, dumbfounded\u2014not a Smith? As if that could be true.\u201cThen you understand Smithing?\u201dLou Mu Yan rolled her eyes at him,\u201d Nonsense, if I don't understand Smithing, then how could I point out the flaws in your shield? Can you ask some deeper questions?\u201dHuo Xiao pursed his lips inwardly\u2014the questions you asked me before didn't have much depth!Huo Xiao suddenly stood up and bowed to Lou Mu Yan, with a serious expression on his face and firmness in his eyes.\u201cYoung Miss Lou, I want you to be my Master, please accept me.\u201d Huo Xiao's attitude suddenly reversed, looking at Lou Mu Yan sincerely as if saying, 'if you don't accept me, I'll let you see how I die'.Lou Mu Yan held her forehead. She truly didn't know what sort of brain circuit Huo Xiao had. She just casually said some simple things and suddenly he wanted to take her as his Master.\u201cMaybe I don't know as much as you, so wouldn't it be a disadvantage for you to take me as your Master?\u201d Lou Mu Yan said, teasing.Huo Xiao shook his head: \u201cFrom the moment you looked at the shield I refined, I found that your proficiency in Smithing is better than me. Even if you aren't a Smith now, but I believe that you understand more things than I do.\u201dHe was obsessed with the Art of Smithing, even if he had almost lost his way on the Path of a Smith because of his arrogance and complacency. But he was a modest and studious person. This young woman completely convinced him, so he was willing to sincerely ask Lou Mu Yan to become his Master. He could tell that she understood far more than him.Lou Mu Yan stroked her chin to look like she was contemplating, and then exchanged a look with Lou Mu Bai. Seeing the approval in the other's eyes, a smile of success rose on her lips.Originally, according to her plan, she only wanted to take Huo Xiao under her wing and let him refine Magic Tools for the Lou Clan. But she didn't expect Huo Xiao to want to take her as his Master after being taught a lesson by her.After analysing the advantages and disadvantages, she felt that it was a waste not to accept a Grade 3 Smith as a disciple. In this world where teachers were highly respected, a relationship with a disciple was much more solid and reliable than a relationship with collaborators.\u201cHave you taken other people as Masters?\u201d\u201cNever. Since I became a Smith, I've been studying it myself.\u201dA touch of amazement flashed by Lou Mu Yan's eyes. It seemed that Huo Xiao's talent for refining wasn't just strong. He could have such an achievement without a Master and having been self-taught\u2014she really picked up a huge bargain.\u201cAlthough I know a lot of Smithing methods, but I don't know how to teach you. Maybe you should change a teacher.\u201d Lou Mu Yan pretended to shirk.Huo Xiao's eyes lit up when he heard the phrase 'I know a lot of Smithing methods', and directly knelt down in front of Lou Mu Yan, saying respectfully: \u201cMaster, please accept this disciple.\u201d If he could take a great person as a Master, kneeling was only a small matter.Lou Mu Yan was taken aback by his actions and immediately dragged him up. She really didn't like others kneeling down to her, \u201cAlright, I'll accept you as my disciple for the time being. We'll make it three years. If you want to back out afterwards, I'll allow it.\u201dAlthough she set a trap for Huo Xiao to crawl into, but she didn't like to force others. However, she believed that after three years, Huo Xiao would definitely be a proper, obedient disciple.\u201cAlright!\u201d Huo Xiao didn't expect this cunning woman to have such a considerate side and his heart grew more sincere.He just felt that today's choice would be the wisest decision made in his entire life.The two high-fived in representation of their alliance. Huo Xiao formally became Lou Mu Yan's disciple, and since then, embarked on a path of Smithing full of oppression and exploitation, yet he felt both pain and\u00a0 joy in it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just when he wanted to speak, Lou Mu Yan tugged his sleeve to stop him.\u201cDo you mean Lou Mu Yan? She won the first place in the freshman's Earth Class, and she obtained the place with her own abilities.\u201d Among the people sitting here, only Lou Mu Yan was at the Great Sword Master cultivation stage. Who Yun Zi Mo was referring to was evident, so Yun Cang explained with an amicable expression.After thinking a little, he added: \u201cShe defeated a Middle-Phase Sword Spirit strength student.\u201dYun Zi Mo raised his eyes and glanced at Lou Mu Yan coldly, nodded to Yun Cang and stopped talking.Yun Cang knew what sort of temperament Yun Zi Mo had, but he also didn't want Lou Mu Yan to misunderstand him. The Imperial Family still wanted to exchange the Marrow Cleansing Pill from Lou Mu Yan for Yun Zi Mo to use in preparation for the Continental Tournament for Hegemony. He couldn't let any misunderstandings form between the two.\u201cLou girl, Zi Mo is your captain for the Selection Trial this time, so he also asked this out of consideration for safety reasons. Don't think too much into it.\u201d Yun Xang looked at Lou Mu Yan with an amicable smile.Lou Mu Yan sneered: \u201cJust say that you're afraid I'll be holding everyone back, why make it sound so pompous.There was a smile yet not quite a smile on her lips. Although she knew Yun Zi Mo didn't deliberately target herself, but this sort of roundabout way of saying she would hold everyone back still made her unhappy. Who new who's be the one to hold others back.Her words that left no face made the expressions of many people change. Yun Zi Mo was the number one cultivator among the younger generation in the Empire and he had an extremely cold temperament. Almost no one dared to provoke him, not to mention choke him like this.They didn't know whether it was because Lou Mu Yan had nothing to fear as she had a strong backing, or because she didn't know any better. Being young sure made one courageous.\u201cI sure do not like to hear such words you've said Young Miss Lou. My Young Royal Uncle is also thinking for everyone's safety. He only spoke the truth. Why are you this angry.\u201d A yellow-clothed woman who sat beside Yun Xin revealed a look of displeasure when looking at Lou Mu Yan.Her meaning was very clear: You\u00a0are\u00a0the one to hold us back. What my Royal Uncle said was right, so now you're only angry because you feel guilty.They were all elites amongst the younger generation. In order to participate in the Trial competition, they had all been in Closed-Door Cultivation until now, so they didn't watch the Grand Competition. In her eyes, Lou Mu Yan was still the well-known trash of the Empire. It must've been mostly luck to be able to defeat a Sword Spirit student.\u201cSpoke the truth? With which eye of yours did you see that I'll be dragging you guys down? Or maybe your younger royal uncle has the ability to predict the future? If you just pulled a guess out from thin air, then please keep your mouth shut.\u201d Lou Mu Yan sneered, \u201cI'll keep my own life safe during the Trial, so I won't need you elites of the Empire to be concerned about it.\u201dAlthough Lan si had warned them that if they caused trouble for themselves, which end up taking their own lives, then they must take responsibility for that themselves. She knew that to be the truth, but the superiors of Yan'zhou Kingdom wouldn't, as much as possible, let those that participated in the Trial to die. And Yun Zi Mo, expectedly, should be one of the people from the two teams they would've secretly ordered to take care of in the Trial.Her choosing to participate in the Trial meant that she naturally had certainty of success. At the very least, she wouldn't be worse off than anyone in this room in terms of having life-saving skills. She didn't need anyone to protect her.Facing Yun Zi Mo's doubts, Lou Mu Yan actually wasn't that angry. She felt that Yun Zi Mo didn't have malicious intent towards her, and instead, it was the other members of the Imperial team that looked down on her greatly. Except, after coming to this world, she had already grown accustomed to these strange eyes she occasionally received. The reason why she deliberately created conflict and counterattacked was so that she could more conveniently facilitate the implementation of her plan.She came to the Glacial Mountain Range not only to participate in the Trial, but also because she had a very important thing to to\u2014that is, to find the Deep Orchid and refine the Foundation Establishment Pill. When that time came, it was naturally impossible to act with these people.\u201cThat's what you said, don't regret it when the time comes\u201d Yun Ge smiled with ridicule and looked down upon Lou Mu Yan with extreme disdain.\u201cYun Ge, shut up.\u201d Yun Lan furrowed his brows and berated roughly, suddenly feeling a sense of disgust towards this younger sister of a different mother.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksYun Ge didn't expect that his Royal Brother would scold her for Lou Mu Yan's sake, revealed an unconvinced expression, but didn't say anything again. Lou Mu Yan can go and seek death as long as it didn't implicate them. It wasn't like she would help her anyways.In the Imperial team all but Yun Lan cast looks of hostility towards Lou Mu Yan. Yun Zi Mo was their legend, was their object of worship, and they couldn't tolerate Lou Mu Yan belittling and slandering him so.Yun Zi Mo remained sitting coldly and expressionlessly, providing no indication of anything. He didn't mean to look down on Lou Mu Yan, not did he believe that she would hold them back. He simply routinely asked the members of the Trial teams about their situation.The cultivation base that Lou Mu Yan displayed was only a Great Sword Master. With such strength, it was extremely dangerous to do missions in the border between the outer ring and the inner ring. To be more precise, it was impossible to stay alive. He meant for it to be a reminder but ended up blundering. However, his temper was always cold, so he didn't intent to explain.This time, he not only had to participate in the Trial to compete for a place, but he also shouldered the responsibility of looking after other people as much as he could. He couldn't be wilful, so no matter what Lou Mu Yan said, if she was really in danger, he would still take action.Yun Cang took a deep look at Yun Ge and already had determined the result of her Trial in his heart.\u201cAlright, I'm going to talk about the rules of the Trial now.\u201d Yun Cang understood not to mention what happened just now. It was useless to say anymore, and he could only hope that Lou Mu Yan wouldn't hold a grudge against Yun Zi Mo because of such a trivial matter.\u201cIn the Trial, between your two teams, you would compete for the six quotas that allowed you to participate in the Continental Tournament for Hegemony. And your Trial this time was divided into three main segments.\u201cFirst, all of you will set off from here and head for the border between the outer ring and the inner rind of the Glacial Mountain range, during which no internal fighting is allowed. Second, after arriving, you can freely form teams and complete two missions each. Those that don't complete them will be eliminated. And third, the remaining people could still form teams freely, and the six people who have completed the final mission will be the winners.\u201cThe content of the missions will be told to you by this old man when arrive at the given locations on the outer and inner rings of the Glacial Mountain Range.\u201d Yun Cang glanced sharply at the two teams and said with a stern warning: \u201cYou are allowed to snatch any mission article from anyone in the Trial, but you are\u00a0never\u00a0allowed to deliberately kill each other. Offenders will be killed without mercy!\u201dThese Trial rules were all set to adapt to the Continental Tournament for Hegemony. Allowing them to form teams was so that the future six could adjust to and support each other when they enter the Tournament for Hegemony and compete with players from other countries.While allowing the Trial members to compete with each other was so that they could understand the cruelty of the world and better train their resilience and mind.\u201cYes!\u201d Everyone replied in unison.\u201cDon't be relying on luck. Even the periphery of the Glacial Mountain Range is extremely dangerous. Everything you do should sit on the premise that you are kept alive. Don't force anything.\u201d Yun Clan panned the room and emphasised the issue of safety again.The people who sat here were all outstanding among the younger generation of Yan'zhou Kingdom. He didn't wish anyone to fall after the Trial, and even if it was unavoidable, he hoped to at least minimise the loss.\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cEarly tomorrow morning, the few instructors will lead you all to the border of the outer and inner ring of the Glacial Mountain Range first. Yun Zi Mo will be the captain of your first segment. You must follow his every command, do you have any problems with that?\u201d Yun Cang's look relaxed somewhat as he asked.\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cThen dismissed. Go have a good rest.\u201d\u201cYes, Imperial Teacher!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEarly the next morning, Lou Mu Yan and the others left the cave dwelling and hurried towards the outskirts of the Glacial Mountain Range.Along the way, they saw a vast expanse of white surrounding them. The entire forest was dressed in white, and so quiet that there weren't even any sounds of birds.After half a day, the snowflakes gradually fell from the sky and when it touched one's body or face, it was so cold that it made one shudder. It even hurt.\u201cEveryone, use an Elemental Energy shield.\u201d Lan Si stopped in his steps and a light green circle of light encased his entire body. The falling snowflakes slipped from the circle of light and could no longer get close to their bodies.When other people saw this, they quickly mobilised the Elemental Energy within them, then five or six different coloured Elemental Energy circles of light lit up, forming a scenic view within the vast snowy land.What Lou Mu Yan mobilised was the fire attribute Elemental Energy circle of light. She could comprehend all the elements of this land, but the one she was most adept in and had the deepest comprehension of was the fire Elemental Energy.Flakes of snow drifted down petal by petal, and before it could near her, the shield of light would melt it into droplets of water that fell to the floor. This scene also fell into the eyes of many attentive people.There were three instructors from the Imperial Family that lead the team with Lan Si, with the main lead being a person named Yun Ji. He scrutinised the mountain not far away, \u201cThis snow really came at the time wrong. Let's go to that mountain and find a place to rest first.\u201dLan Si and the rest nodded in agreement. Snowflakes such as these that were corrosive shouldn't be allowed to make contact with the skin for long periods of time, otherwise one would be inflicted with the Cold Poison. If one wanted to resist, one needed to use their Elemental Energy circle of light shield to protect their body.But in such a dangerous place, continuously using Elemental Energy within them not only meant that it would be quickly exhausted, but if one encountered a Demonic Beast attack, they would all be in danger.The snow fell heavier and heavier, and the energy of the Elemental Energy circle of light that everyone used to resist the corrosion was constantly being strengthened. Gradually, everyone's strength couldn't match their desire to protect themselves. Luckily in the last two hours, they finally found a big cave on a hillside.Lan Si and Yun I went in first to investigate, and after they came out, they called everyone in.\u201cThis cave is very deep. We went in for a long time, but we still haven't reached the end. We'll rest here for now and wait for the heavy snow to recede then continue on our way. All of you, quickly replenish your elemental Energy.\u201d Lan Si's eyes were deep, without his usual gentle smile, and a rare look of gravity surfaced on his face.\u201cYes!\u201d After walking with the Elemental Energy shield for so long, whether it was the student's physical strength of Elemental Energy, they were all depleted by a lot. Everyone sat down and began to absorb the Spiritual Force of Heaven and earth to replenish themselves.Lan Si and the six other instructors left two of them to guard against emergencies at the front and the back and recovered their Elemental Energy in rotation.After sitting down, Lou Mu Yan raised her head and looked deeply at the cave that she could see no end to, and an ominous feeling rose in her heart without warning.She didn't sit cross-legged like the rest to enter a state and absorb Spiritual Force to replenish her Elemental Energy, but instead directly took out the candy from Lan Si and threw them into her mouth in one breath. Then she telepathically told Lou Mu Bai to also eat the candy first to replenish their Elemental Energy.When the sweet scent of the candy pill spread, the others noticed the actions of the brother and sister. Lan Si couldn't help but twitch the corner of his lips\u2014did this brother and sister pair seriously take what he gave them as candy!The Imperial Academy students all knew what the candy was, and they looked at them with eyes that expressed 'my flesh hurt1, what prodigals!'Forget about Lou Mu Yan the prodigal girl acting crazy, why was Lou Mu Bai also following in the nonsense? These things should naturally be used during a critical time. It was just a waste to eat it now.Of course, in a while, they wouldn't think this way, and they would all regret how they didn't imitate the brother and sister pair.The members of the Imperial Family also noticed the actions of the brother and sister pair. Although they didn't understand, they didn't think about it so as not to be distracted, and soon entered the cultivation recovery mode.After Lou Mu Yan finished eating the candy, the Elemental Energy in her body was quickly replenished. There wasn't any need to recover using meditation, so she stood up and walked to the edge of the cave, grabbed a handful of dirt and smelled it.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThis behaviour made Lan Si very curious. He looked at Lou Mu Yan distractedly while meditating and asked: \u201cLou Mu Yan, what're you smelling? You can't eat this kind of dirt.\u201dLou Mu Yan rolled her eyes at Lan Si. With which eye did he see her wanting to eat this dirt. But since they were all locusts connected by one thread2, she still reminded them as if intentionally yet also unintentionally: \u201cTeacher, you didn't notice any peculiar smell in this cave?\u201d\u201cPeculiar smell?\u201d Lan Si was surprised, then sniffed around everywhere, and gradually also felt that something was wrong.\u201cLou Mu Yan, just what's the matter with you? Not only did you not take a good rest, and instead wasted all the candy used to replenish Elemental Energy that Teacher Lan gave, but you also go and sniff some dirt? Where's the peculiar smell in here? I think you're just bored and looking for trouble.\u201cYou don't need to rest, but don't affect other people recovering their Elemental Energy.\u201d Hu Fei, also an instructor from the Imperial Academy, looked at Lou Mu Yan unhappily. There was nothing but provocation in his words.The moment his voice fell, a few students that were meditating and recovering opened their eyes and looked at Lou Mu Yan in disgust. They really questioned just how this trash was chosen to participate in the Trial.They really wanted to throw her out, but considering Lou Mu Bai's face, they were barely able to resist cursing at her.\u201cAm I affecting others? All I was doing was smelling some dirt, what did it have to do with you? Instead, instructor must be deliberately trying to affect the Imperial team's recovery by reprimanding so loudly.\u201dLou Mu Yan leaned against the wall of the cave, raised an eyebrow and continued: \u201cAfter all, if we met danger, our students all have the candy that Teacher Lan distributed before to replenish our Elemental Energy, while the members of the Imperial Family\u2026\u201d She only spoke half the sentence, but her meaning was evident.You can incite disharmony, this old mother3\u00a0of yours, can too.\u00a0Lou Mu Yan sneered in her heart. She could now dare conclude that this man surnamed Hu was just purely against her. The hostility was just too obvious.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Hu Fei didn't expect Lou Mu Yan to counterattack him, and his face was black with anger. Then he finally raised his hand and pointed at Lou Mu Yan, saying: \u201cSo this is your attitude towards a teacher?\u201dLou Mu Yan looked at his outstretched finger coldly. She hated others pointing at her the most. The corners of her lips rose into a careless and casual smile that carried with it a sense of ridicule: \u201cIs there any problem with my attitude towards a teacher? A teacher worthy of my respect, I naturally will respect. As for those like Teacher Hu who have bad intentions, forgive me for I don't dare to praise. Even if I'm the Imperial Academy's student, I really can't stand it anymore. After all, right now we still have to participate in the first round of the examination with the members of the Imperial Family, no?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dHu Fei really didn't expect Lou Mu Yan to argue so tediously and vexatiously. Seeing that one of the instructors from the Imperial Family cast a suspicious and unhappy gaze on him, he almost collapsed from being angered. To explain wasn't a good idea, yet not to explain was also not a good idea.\u201cEnough! Is it time for a quarrel right now?\u201d Yun Ji was the eldest and he immediately scolded them upon seeing their quarrel intensify.Then he looked at Hu Fei with a faint dislike in his eyes, \u201cHu Fei, why are you, as an instructor, seizing onto a little girl and not letting go. She only smelled the dirt, how could it affect the recovery of the others? In fact you being so loud just now made it appear as if it was on purpose.\u201dYun Ji didn't like Hu Fei from their first encounter. This person harboured evil intentions\u2014that was his judgement of Hu Fei. As for his feelings towards Lou Mu Yan, he wasn't like the rest that looked at her with coloured eyes4, not to mention the order that the Imperial Teacher gave him before coming, so he naturally was biased towards Lou Mu Yan.Lou Mu Yan glanced at Yun Jin in surprise, a little curious that this person didn't actually blame her, but instead helped her.Hu Fei was so angered he almost got a crooked nose. Yun Ji actually humiliated him like this using his identity as one of the leaders of this team. He noted down this grudge.1in case people forgot, 'flesh/meat (forgot which one I used previously) hurt' figuratively means that them being so wasteful and luxurious hurts them as if they were cutting off a piece of their own meat lol.2figuratively means they're in this together. No idea how that originated.3arrogant way of referring to oneself by females.4like wearing coloured glasses. Means someone who is prejudiced, so in this case, he didn't look at her in a prejudiced way like the others.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYun Ji's warning caused Hu Fei to temporarily shut his mouth. Lou Mu Yan also stopped talking, but continued to walk a few steps, then squat down to scrutinise the cave wall.Even though her behaviour made others feel she had a problem, there weren't any voices that questioned her anymore, and they all calmed down to recover.Lou Mu Yan looked at the tiny crawl marks on the cave all and a trace of understanding and fear surfaced in her eyes. She quickly got up and walked to Lan Si's side and said: \u201cTeacher, this cave's dangerous. Let's leave quickly.\u201dLan Si looked up at Lou Mu Yan, unsure of whether to cry or laugh and asked: \u201cReally? Where'd you see it?\u201dThen thought to himself: Oh little grandaunt, can you just be quiet for a while? Don't you see that most of the other students want to throw you out?\u201cPfft!\u201d Yun Ge snorted, opened her eyes with a look of disgust, \u201cLou Mu Yan, you don't need to exaggerate to scare just to attract Chi Yi Xuan's attention do you?\u201cThis cave is so quiet, there's nothing strange at all, where is there any danger? If you're as afraid as a mouse, then get out and stop affecting us recovering our Elemental Energy. Otherwise even if you're Lou Mu Bai's younger sister, I'll personally take care of you.\u201dAs soon as Yun Ge's voice fell, an icy pressure spread in the cave. Lou Mu Bai stood up and walked beside Lou Mu Yan. There was a chill in his eyes that looked at Yun Ge, and his voice was cold and oppressive: \u201cSay that again.\u201dYun Ge was an Advanced-Phase Sword Spirit, so at this time, beneath Lou Mu Bai's pressure, she felt her heart tremble. She gritted her teeth and glared at Lou Mu Bai, saying stubbornly: \u201cIt's your younger sister that's looking for a sense of existence. You being partial towards her is only hurting her, not helping her. I'm right.\u201dThe coldness in Lou Mu Bai's eyes gradually deepened. He narrowed his eyes slightly and a killing intent was inadvertently revealed, which caused Yun Ge to feel a sense of fear in her heart for no reason.Suddenly a domineering golden light flashed by. Ji Han Xu stood in front of Yun Ge and temporarily resolved the murderous pressure. He toughened his skin and said with a smile: \u201cMu Bai, Yun Ge doesn't have any malicious indent either, so there's no need for you to argue with a little girl like her.\u201dBut he scolded Lou Mu Yan in his heart. This woman really was a troublemaker. She could cause a fight wherever she went.Of course, Ji Han Xu was also very angry at his betrothed, Yun Ge. If it weren't because if she got into trouble, he would too, he didn't want to step out and face Lou Mu Bai.At this time, all those that were meditating couldn't continue to concentrate on recovering either, and most people cast unhappy gazes at Lou Mu Yan. This woman really was someone that held them back.Lou Mu Bai glanced at Ji Han Xu lightly and spit out a word coldly: \u201cMove.\u201dJi Han Xu's anger only grew. He was cautious of Lou Mu Bai, but it didn't mean he was afraid of him, so he stood up straight and said, \u201cIf you want to go over, then pass me first.\u201dA coldness condensed on Lou Mu Bai's gentle and handsome face. When he was about to move, Lou Mu Yan suddenly grabbed his arm from behind and took a stepped back. He looked at her in confusion.Lou Mu Yan's gaze was transfixed on the endless cave, sighed and said: \u201cIt's coming.\u201dNo one understood her behaviour, let along what she meant by 'it's coming'.\u201cQuickly step back, be careful.\u201d Lan Si shouted suddenly, stretched out both his hands and sucked hard. The two students who were sitting near the side of the cave was grabbed by him.Immediately, everyone could only hear countless [hiss!] sounds resounding in the cave, making people's scalp numb.But before anyone could react, they saw countless small blue serpents that were as thick as one's arm slither out of the endless cave and towards them swiftly.\u201cIce Krait Serpents, it's the Ice Krait Serpent!\u201d Someone in the group of students suddenly exclaimed.The others all took out their own Magic Tools and held them in their hands with seriousness. Ice Krait Serpents were social Demonic Beasts. The moment it appeared it would be in the hundreds to thousands, and there could even be a high-level Ice Krait Serpent King. They didn't expect that after only just stepping foot in the Glacial Mountain Range's peripheral, they'd encounter this kind of trouble.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cCalm down. This is also a test for everyone.\u201d Yun Ji said with furrowed his brows as he looked at the chaotic crowd.Currently, Lou Mu Yan's eyes weren't on the Ice Krait Serpents that were slithering towards them, but instead continued to stare at the depths of the cave with emotions that others couldn't understand.Lou Mu Yan squinted at Mo Yan on her shoulder and twitched the corners of her mouth, \u201cYou want me to go kill the Tier 5 Ice Krait Serpent King in the cave?\u201dA determination to win flashed across Mo Yan's eyes and he telepathically replied: \u201cIts Demonic Beast Crystal Core is useful to me.\u201d\u201cDo you think that with my current cultivation base, I can pass through tens of thousands of Ice Krait Serpents ranging from Tier 2 to Tier 4, and rush in alone to kill the Ice Krait Serpent King for you?\u201d Lou Mu Yan rolled her eyes, \u201cYou must still be asleep.\u201d\u201cDon't you have a kind of powder that can paralyse Demonic Beasts for a short period of time? It should be easy to deal with these little serpents right? I'll help you after we rush in.\u201d Mo Yan's voice carried with it a sense of certainty.Lou Mu Yan took a breath. This damned Spirit Pet\u2014just who was the master? But towards Mo Yan's proposal, she felt a little tempted.\u201cBut let these people suffer a bit before we take action. Perfect to help us share some burdens.\u201d Mo Yan sneered. He definitely hadn't forgotten how these people belittled Lou Mu Yan just now. The Master he had temporarily recognised wasn't someone anyone could bully.Lou Mu Yan nodded in agreement. The reason why she was too lazy to argue with Yun Ge just now was because she had discovered that the serpents at the depths of this cave had awakened because of their aura. Now, she'll just let these elites of the Empire to have a taste of the Ice Krait Serpents first.She wasn't a bad person, nor a villain, but she definitely wasn't a good person either. It was only acceptable to punish them a little. Besides, with her current cultivation base, it was indeed difficult for her, even if she wanted to, to deal with all the Ice Krait Serpents.Lan Si held a thin, translucent green sword and swung a few times at the serpents that had crawled over. Several aggressive sword auras with dense pressure swept towards them. The hundreds of Ice Krait Serpents in the front two rows were shopped into numerous pieces.Yun Zi Mo also commanded the others to kill the Ice Krait Serpents that approached them.Right now, everyone just wanted to get out of the cave as soon as possible, but no one thought that, before they could even approach the exit, the same [hiss!] sound sounded. No one knew from where another group of Ice Krait Serpents slithered out and blocked the exit completely.Lan Si waved the longsword in his hand and recalled Lou Mu Yan's unusual state after entering the cave. So it seemed that she used the fastest way to restore her Elemental Energy because she felt danger. When he remembered her act of smelling the dirt, he couldn't help but sigh within that Lou Mu Yan's nose was just so good.He looked around at the serpents that circled them in all directions and couldn't help but ask: \u201cLou Mu Yan, what do you think we should do?\u201d\u201cDo cold food with dressing1!\u201dSo now they knew to ask her for her opinion, what about when she asked them to leave the cave as soon as possible, didn't one by one they told her to get out?\u201c\u2026\u201d Lan Si was speechless for a moment. Lou Mu Yan's temperament really was rather strong, but he could understand it.The moment she mentioned that something smelled weird, he felt that something was wrong in this cave too. When she asked to leave, he was confused and was about to ask for the reason, but who knew that it would be interrupted by Hu Fei and Yun Ge. In fact, he was also rather wronged. He really didn't doubt Lou Mu Yan was acting foolishly.At this time, many people also remembered what occurred before. Although they still wondered why Lou Mu Yan knew that there were dangers hidden in this cave, but more people were blaming Hu Fei and Yun Ge for being meddlesome. If they hadn't stepped out and delayed time, then they wouldn't be besieged by this huge number of serpents right now.1ok, I tried HAHA. In Chinese, there's a common way to answer someone when they ask: 'what should we do?' (\u600e\u4e48\u529e? z\u011bn me b\u00e0n). If you want to answer in a non-serious way, bickering way, and/or a sarcastic way, you'd answer with something along the lines of 'dress cold food with sauce' (\u51c9\u62cc li\u00e1ng b\u00e0n)\u2014especially if you don't know the answer to the question to begin with. It's probably used because \u529e (b\u00e0n) and \u62cc (b\u00e0n) sound exactly the same, just spelt differently and mean different things, so they chose that commonality and someone, I guess, just randomly used that word one day and it was made popular. It makes no sense, but that's the point I guess.There is one more meaning behind it though: to ignore the situation/problem. Which actually makes the word \u51c9 rather suiting because it means 'cold'. And I guess it's also like saying to give the situation/problem the 'cold shoulder'. \u51c9could also be used to describe desolation, disappointment, heart sinking etc. Take with that information what you will hahaha. That's just my understanding based on years of hearing and reading that word and a brief baidu search with Chinese answers while translating XD.Oops, sorry for being a few minutes late.

She used her Silk-Mist Steps to manoeuvre around and secretly stuffed small paper bags with powdered drugs to Lou Mu Bai, Yun Lan and the rest.\u201cIn a moment, scatter the powder on the surrounding snakes. They'll temporarily lose their ability to move and they'll be frozen.\u201d Seeing the countless casualties among the serpents on the ground, she telepathically spoke to them in secret.The people were surprised after receiving her telepathic words, but they held the powder she gave them tightly in their hands and prepared to move at the right moment.\u201cElder brother, I'm going into the cave for a while, help cover for me.\u201d Lou Mu Yan moved beside Lou Mu Bai and telepathically told him.Lou Mu Bai swung his sword to kill the serpents that attacked while furrowing his brows and said disapprovingly: \u201cWhat are you doing going deeper in? It's dangerous down there. Or I'll go with you.\u201d\u201cElder brother, I'm well aware of the situation. Just help cover for me, I'll be back soon.\u201d Lou Mu Yan's eyes were firm. She couldn't always rely on others when encountering difficulties, not to mention she had a way to deal with the Serpent King.Lou Mu Bai felt uneasy, but he also understood the nature of his younger sister. No one could stop what she set her mind on doing. After swinging his sword to clear out a portion of the obstacles, he said: \u201cGo, but you must be careful. If you're not out in an hour, then I'll go in to look for you.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d After receiving Lou Mu Bai's approval, Lou Mu Yan tapped her foot and moved towards the inside of the cave quietly when others weren't paying attention.Under Mo Yan's deliberate release of pressure, the low-level Ice Krait Serpents gave way, and in only moments, she had arrived deeper into the cave.And her action also fell in the eyes of Lan Si and Yun Zi Mo, but the two didn't stop her nor say anything about it. After taking a silent look, they retrieved their gaze and continued to kill the overwhelming serpents.The cave was completely dark, and the walls were slippery. After she left the crowd completely, she took out a night-luminous pearl from her interspatial ring, which instantly illuminated ten metres of her surroundings.She walked forward cautiously as Mo Yan stood on her shoulder, directing her into a long, narrow passage.\u201cThe Ice Krait Serpent King's at the end of the passage. I don't know what Secret Skill it used to cover up the fluctuations of a Demonic Beast and its aura, but that's why the rest of you didn't discover the serpent nest and its existence.\u201cIn a bit, I'll mobilise my innate talent and use the King Class Demonic Beast's pressure to temporarily trap it. You take the opportunity to kill it.\u201d Mo Yan moved his deep back eyes, and his tone carried with it an inherent domineering attitude and self-confidence.Lou Mu Yan halted. She mobilised the Spiritual Energy within her, bit her right index finger until it bled, and flicked towards the void. Four drops of blood rose in the sky, then she stretched out her hand to draw four Talisman Incantations with dense Spiritual Energy in the void. Only then did she carefully leapt into the cave.As soon as she felt her feet land on the ground by the cave, a sudden extremely cold icicle shot straight towards her.Lou Mu Yan was vigilant throughout, so the moment she landed, she quickly utilised her Silk-Mist Steps to manoeuvre around. The chilling icicle just shot past her shoulder and embedded into the wall behind her, smashing out a hole.She moved a few steps again and stood on a relatively safe high rock. When she raised her eyes, she met a pair of cold serpent eyes.The huge body of the serpent opposite her was coiled on a huge ice pillar. Its whole body was icy blue, and its scales glowed with chillingly light.It flicked its forked tongue and stared at Mo Yan on Lou Mu Yan's shoulder greedily.Seeing the Ice Krait Serpent King stare at Mo Yan as if watching its prey, Lou Mu Yan raised an eyebrow, smiled and said: \u201cMo Yan, it's treating you as if you're dinner!\u201d There was no shortage of gloating in her tone.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksMo Yan glanced at the woman that was smiling like a flower, turned his head and snorted coldly: \u201cIs something like that guy worthy?\u201d[HISS HISS!] Hearing the open conversation between the one human and one beast, the Ice Krait Serpent King raised its head and hissed, completely angered.It discovered that a group of humans had arrived in its territory earlier, so it decided that when the time was right, it would release all the serpents to attack. It initially wanted to wait for the humans to be bitten to death before going out and swallowing it into its stomach to refine them, but it didn't expect that there would be a weak human who would break in first.The most important thing was that on the shoulder of this weak person, there was a mysterious Demonic Beast that resembled a Fire Cloud Mink. Yet it made it feel as if its energy and blood inflated, and a thirst for it was birthed spontaneously.There was a voice in its heart that kept telling it that as long as it swallowed and refined the little white beast opposite, it would be able to break through to a Tier 6 Demonic Beast.That extreme desire caused the Ice Krait Serpent to hiss a few times, opened its mouth and spat out dozens of ice arrows that contained dual elemental attributes towards Lou Mu Yan. It wanted to kill the one human and one beast before it and devour them.Lou Mu Yan darted away and manoeuvred around the ice cave ceaselessly. Because of the difference in their cultivation levels, not to mention the Ice Krait Serpent King owned the dual attributes of ice and water, she could only put in all her effort to barely avoid the ice arrows that constantly shot towards her and prevent herself from being injured.Mo Yan leapt off Lou Mu Yan's shoulder. His body suddenly enlarged from the size of a palm to at least more than a metre long before stopping. He roared violently towards the Ice Krait Serpent.[ROAR!!] A deafening roar echoed in the huge ice cave.Mo Yan integrated a kind of Soul attack-type innate talent into the roar. The pressure that belonged to a King Class Demonic Beast stacked on top of each other, and like the explosion of a mountain torrent, rolled towards the Ice Krait Serpent King.Lou Mu Yan also avoided the last ice arrow at that moment. She muttered a few sentences, waved her hand casually, and four Void Talismans that carried Spiritual Energy rose into the air, taking the opportunity to surround the Ice Krait Serpent while it was stunned by Mo Yan's roar.[HISS HISS!] The pressure caused the Ice Krait Serpent to shudder from the bottom of his heart. Its Demonic Soul within its yao'fu trembled slightly and it raised its head in pain as it hissed a few times.Although Mo Yan was able to use his innate talent, but because his cultivation base was only at the strength of a Tier 3 Demonic Beast, the same level as Lou Mu Yan, so the period of time that he was able to utilise his innate talent was relatively short. There was only one chance.When the pressure that wound around its yao'fu and Demonic Soul gradually dissipated, the Ice Krait Serpent King was completely angered with some fear. A trace of scarlet rose in its ice-cold serpent eyes.Seeing that the Demonic Beast that was at least one metre long on the ground had returned to the size of a palm, the Serpent King felt disdain towards it\u2014so what if it was a King Class Demonic Beast. Now the opponent's strength wasn't even comparable to itself from a Middle-Class Demonic Clan.The greedy colour and fierce light in its eyes grew thicker. It definitely must swallow its opponent and refine its Demonic Core. Maybe it wouldn't only advance to a Tier 6 Demonic Beast, it could also be able to reach Tier 7 or Tier 8. Just thinking about it dilated its pores in excitement, extremely transparent.Lou Mu Yan sneered\u2014the Serpent King opposite her would have to pay the price for underestimating her right now.She created sixteen Taoist Seals in the air and inserted them into the four Void Talismans one by one.\u201cFour Symbols1\u00a0Killing Array, condense!\u201dLou Mu Yan exclaimed lightly. The six Taoist Seals echoed in collaboration with each other, and with the four Void Talismans. They connected to form a long, transparent ribbon Talisman Incantation which perfectly wrapped around the thick body of the Ice Krait Serpent King.The Ice Krait Serpent King felt an external force restrain its body. With a look, he discovered it was that weak human woman that was causing trouble. It moved its head a little and didn't place much importance to her, then opened its ferocious mouth and bit towards Mo Yan on the ground.Lou Mu Yan curled the corners of her lips and spit out a word coldly: \u201cEXPLODE!!\u201d1The Four Symbols refers to the 'Four Guardian Beasts' or 'Four Gods' or 'Four Auspicious Beasts' aka Black Tortoise of the North, Azure Dragon of the East, Vermillion Bird of the South and White Tiger of the West. Also aka Genbu, Seiryuu, Suzaku and Byakko.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 79:\u00a0Kill\u201cEXPLODE!!\u201dLou Mu Yan's cold voice fell and one of the characters on the ribbon-like Talisman Incantation that wound around the Ice Krait Serpent King leapt out and transformed into a transparent cyan dragon with dense Spiritual Energy that whistled out and plunged directly into the Ice Krait Serpent King's heart.The huge mouth of the Ice Krait Serpent King halted above Mo Yan's head and its eyes instantly turned bloodshot. Suddenly, its body limped, and it collapsed onto the ice-cold floor heavily.It curled into a ball as if it was in extreme pain. But it wasn't over. If one listened carefully, there was actually a muffled sound that resounded from within the Ice Krait Serpent's body, like firecrackers that had been lit.[HISS HISS!!] The Ice Krait Serpent King moved in pain and hovered above the giant ice pillar, hitting the icicle continuously from head to tail.Its internal organs were slowly being corroded by the Spiritual Energy talisman dragon, which then exploded in its body. Its strong impacts and struggles made the originally stable cave be on the verse of collapse as pieces of ice and rock fell.Lou Mu Yan narrowed her eyes, stretched out two fingers and drew in the air again. A flash of white Spiritual Energy once again penetrated into the body of the Ice Krait Serpent's body, then it finally fell heavily from the giant pillar and hit the ground again.When the dragon talisman burrowed itself into the yao'fu of the Ice Krait Serpent King and tore the serpent's Demonic Soul out from its body, the Ice Krait Serpent King's body completely stopped struggling and it laid quietly on the ground without a single breath left in it.Lou Mu Yan waved her hand and the half-cun-long1\u00a0transparent talisman dragon cheerfully flew over, holding the Ice Krait Serpent King's Demonic Soul, and landed on her hand.She smiled softly, then the talisman dragon disappeared into her body, while the Demonic Soul was trapped within a new Spiritual Talisman that she drew.\u201cThis is useful to you?\u201d Lou Mu Yan threw the transparent ball that imprisoned the Ice Krait Serpent King's Demonic Soul to Mo Yan.Mo Yan opened his mouth and swallowed the Demonic Soul of the Ice Krait Serpent. The Spiritual Talisman drawn by Lou Mu Yan was also broken in his mouth.Lou Mu Yan took a few steps forward and nodded with satisfaction as she looked at the intact Ice Krait Serpent King corpse. It would be more appropriate for this corpse to be taken back to Huo Xiao to be refined into a few Magic Tools that she'd gift to her family.Although the corpse of the Flame Unicorn Beast was Tier 6, but no one except her in the Lou Clan had comprehended the fire Elemental Energy attribute, so the Magic Tools refined from the Flame Unicorn Beast's scales weren't suitable for them.She took out a dagger from her interspatial ring and directly inserted it into the Ice Krait Serpent's head. Then she channelled her Elemental Energy to crack it open, and with a grab, two blue Crystal Cores, one deep, one light, landed in her hand.\u201cWho expected that the talent of the Ice Krait Serpent King wasn't that bad. It actually condensed two Crystal Cores of different attributes. Luckily it only recently advanced to Tier 5 Demonic Beast, otherwise we would have to use some of our trump cards to kill it today.\u201d Lou Mu Yan played with the Crystal Core in her hand and raised an eyebrow at Mo Yan.Mo Yan didn't even glance at the corpse on the ground and jumped directly onto Lou Mu Yan's shoulder. His voice was cold as usual: \u201cYou still have some trump cards?\u201dHe also went to watch the Academy's Grand Competition that Lou Mu Yan participated in last time. Her strength was unexpected, and her combat power was extraordinary. It truly did give him a little surprise that day.But he didn't expect that he still underestimated this woman. Today, he hadn't even seen the methods that Lou Mu Yan used to kill the Ice Krait Serpent King before, even when he was at the peak of his strength. With such methods, it would even make him cautious and fearful if they weren't in a contractual relationship.But when he was already shocked by it, Lou Mu Yan actually told him that she still had more trump cards. It truly overthrew all that he knew.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksLou Mu Yan's neat and clean combat mode, and how her proficiency wasn't even inferior to when he was at his peak, was this really a Clan's trash? How could a Great Sword Master cultivation base woman understand so much? Why does a sixteen-year-old young woman have such rich combat experience and methods?She was like a cloud of mist, and every bit that she displayed wasn't her true self, as if she was looming within layers upon layers of thin veils, making people want to explore and understand even deeper.Lou Mu Yan utilised her Mental Energy and put the entire corpse of the Ice Krait Serpent King into her interspatial ring. She stretched out her hand to poke Mo Yan's back and chuckled softly, saying: \u201cThis Glacial Mountain Range is very dangerous, maybe you'll see my trump cards soon.\u201dMo Yan's eyes that were as deep and boundless as the sea fluctuated like a whirlpool. Although, between him and Lou Mu Yan, they were under the Contract of Equals, but their mutual understanding and trust had not yet reached the point where they'd rely on and support each other entirely.He stopped inquiring, just stared down at the two Crystal Cores in Lou Mu Yan's hand and said: \u201cGive me the two Crystal Cores for refining.\u201d\u201cYou want to refine it directly?\u201d Lou Mu Yan glanced around the serpent cave as if looking for something.\u201cHow can I absorb it without refining it directly? As long as I refine these two Crystal Cores, plus the Demonic Soul I just swallowed, I'll soon be able to break through to Tier 5 strength.\u201d\u201cWhen I have time, I'll use these Crystal Cores to refine a cauldron of pills for you. The effect's much better than refining it directly!\u201d\u201cSure!\u201d Mo Yan was still quite convinced by Lou Mu Yan's Alchemy skills. Seeing that Lou Mu Yan still wasn't leaving, he looked towards the corner of the cave and asked incomprehensibly: \u201cWhat're you looking for?\u201d\u201cOf course I'm looking for the treasure collected by the Ice Krait Serpent King. It's been in this Glacial Mountain Range for so many years, it's impossible for it to not have collected the Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Items here.\u201d Lou Mu Yan used the whip to remove an ice stone as she explained to Mo Yan.Mo Yan couldn't help but twitch the corner of his eyes\u2014this woman really didn't let go of anything. Then he said jokingly: \u201cI'm the best at finding Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Items.\u201dWhen Lou Mu Yan saw that there was nothing under the removed ice stone, she was a little disappointed, but then she suddenly heard Mo Yan's words and couldn't help but knock her head lightly with her knuckle, \u201cThat's right! How could I have forgotten you still have that talent.\u201dSeeing Mo Yan lying aloofly on her shoulder, she grabbed him and tossed him out, \u201cDon't just know how to enjoy and not do work, go find the treasure.\u201dMo Yan turned his head and headed towards the left side of the cave in a bad mood. He had lived for so long, and no one had dared to toss him. Lou Mu Yan really was the first person.But he didn't dislike such actions and even a sense of the desire to coddle someone, that had never appeared before, rose in his heart. He really was being infected by this black-bellied woman!A Spirit Devourer's sensitivity to Spiritual Herbs were hundreds of times stronger than Fire Cloud Minks. He only casually sniffed around and already confirmed the location of the Ice Krait Serpent's treasure. He stood atop an ice stone that wasn't quite large nor small and said: \u201cThe things are placed beneath this ice stone, come get it yourself.\u201dLou Mu Yan's eyes lit up and her stunning little face displayed a gleeful smile. After Mo Yan leapt onto her shoulder again, she waved her whip and smashed the ice stone in half. Sure enough, beneath the stone, she discovered a large hole.She raised the corners of her lips, plunged the whip into the hole skilfully, and with a tug, the treasures that the Ice Krait Serpent King had prized over the years all entered her interspatial ring.However, due to the time constraints, she didn't investigate it immediately, but instead used her Silk-Mist Steps and leapt towards the entrance. After exiting the cave's entrance, she also used her Elemental Energy to strike down the ice mountain's loose gravel to seal the entrance.After completing all this, she swiftly headed towards the Trial teams. Now that the Ice Krait Serpent King was dead, the commands that controlled the group of serpents would also disappear.With the serpents having no leader, after her eldest brother and the rest used the powder she gave, she believed that the battle above them would almost be over too. She had to return among them before the battle was over.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 80: Attitude\u00a0ChangeLou Mu Yan used Silk-Mist Steps at its fastest and arrived in the cave where everyone had rested before.The battle wasn't over yet, and at this time, piles of Ice Krait Serpent corpses were everywhere. The students were practically exhausted as they dealt with the last wave of small serpents.She quickly moved to Lou Mu Bai's side when the others weren't paying attention and waved her whip to help him behead a wave of small serpents that surrounded him.Lou Mu Bai had taken the candy, that was from Lan Si, earlier with Lou Mu Yan so he still had more than half of his Elemental Energy left, which meant, compared to the others, he had it much easier. Only after seeing his younger sister return safely did his hovering heart gradually fall back into place.\u201cDone?\u201d Lou Mu Bai asked Lou Mu Yan telepathically.Lou Mu Yan and Lou Mu Bai killed the last batch of Ice Krait Serpents back-to-back, \u201cYep, it's done!\u201dThe battles of the rest were also coming to an end. Several students had practically exhausted their Elemental Energy and it was thanks to the help of Lan Si and the several teachers that they could survive the swarm of serpents.When the last Ice Krait Serpent was killed, whether it was the Empire Academy Trial students or the Imperial Family Trial team, most of them were sitting on the ground panting and many were more or less injured too.Yun Zi Mo walked straight to Lou Mu Yan with a touch of complexity in his eyes and asked: \u201cYou gave them those powdered drugs?\u201d\u201cSo what if it's me?\u201d Lou Mu Yan knew that Yun Zi Mo and Lan Si had both noticed that she had left earlier, but she couldn't consider too much at the time. Though, if Yun Zi Mo mentioned it now, she inevitably would experience some trouble.Yun Zi Mo's eyes darkened, fell silent, then faintly said: \u201cNothing.\u201d Then he turned directly around and walked not far away to sit and meditate to recover his Elemental Energy.A sliver of surprise slipped past Lou Mu Yan's heart. Yun Zi Mo's brain wasn't ill was it? But this was fine too. It saved her from having to explain to everyone.Lan Si looked at Yun Zi Mo thoughtfully, then asked Lou Mu Yan: \u201cDo you still have the powdered drug?\u201dHearing Lan Si's question, everyone in their cave cast their gazes towards Lou Mu Yan, and many people held complex emotions in their eyes.If it weren't for the powder that Lou Mu Bai and the others scattered that temporarily paralysed those waves of Tier 3 and 4 Ice Krait Serpents, they could still be fighting bitterly right now, or there could have even been some casualties.The powdered drug's effect was truly strong. Putting the fact that it was useful against Tier 4 Demonic Beasts aside, it could even be used in group attacks. If everyone carried some on them, next time, even if they encountered a group of Demonic Beast attacks, they'd still have confidence in escaping.\u201cThere are still some more.\u201d Lou Mu Yan didn't hesitate and took out a part of the powdered drug she had in her interspatial ring and gave it to Lan Si.Since knowing that she was coming to the Glacial Mountain Range, she had equipped herself with a lot of sleeping powder that she refined. Now that Lan Si asked for it for the other students, she would still give him this face. What's more, in the first segment where everyone travelled together, they would experience both glory and loss as one.Lan Si nodded with a smile: \u201cThank you! I'll report to the Principal to compensate you after returning to the Empire.\u201d\u201cNo need!\u201d Lou Mu Yan smiled indifferently. These powders weren't worth a lot of money, so they might as well be used to buy people's hearts.Lan Si raised his eyebrow and with a gentle smile again: \u201cYoung Miss Lou sure is generous! Then we won't be courteous.\u201dLou Mu Yan rolled her eyes at him and cursed secretly: \u201cFox!\u201dLan Si asked Ji Xuan to redistribute the powdered drug that he obtained from Lou Mu Yan to everyone who participated in the Trial, \u201cPut these powdered drugs away well. There are a lot of Demonic Beast packs in the Glacial Mountain Range. If you meet them again, this is also a means of saving your life.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d After everyone answered, some of them even looked at Lou Mu Yan apologetically. Their previous attitude towards her was too arbitrary.Then Lan Si and the several instructors picked through the piles of Ice Krait Serpent corpses in the cave, dug out their Crystal Cores, and gave everyone a share.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksOnly after taking a rest in the cave for the night, when everyone's physical strength and Elemental Energy returned to their peaks, did Lan Si and Yun Ji lead them on their way.Along the way, many people's attitudes towards Lou Mu Yan had changed a lot, and from time to time, some people would even strike up a conversation with her.\u201cWe've arrived at the periphery, let's take a break first. Once we enter here, we'll be in the world where Tier 4 Demonic Beasts roam. Their cultivation base is similar to yours, so be vigilant at all times!\u201dWhen they arrived at a place where green plants grew, fresh flowers intertwined, and a forest that grew vigorously, Lan Si ordered everyone to rest.Not all places in the Glacial Mountain Range were ice mountains. There was only daylight here, but in some places where the sun shone all year round, all seasons were practically like spring.After resting for a while, they continued on their way. Except after only walking for not even two hours, they heard some fighting noises and the roaring of Demonic Beasts in the woods ahead.Lan Si made a stop gesture, exchanged a glance with Yun Ji, then handed the students over to the several other instructors, before the two leapt in that direction.Lou Mu Yan looked in that direction and telepathically spoke to Mo Yan, \u201cDid the people ahead meet Demonic Beasts?\u201dIt wasn't far ahead, and if she spread her Mental Energy, then she could find out what was happening there, but there was a Demonic Sense that was super strong, where with one casual sweep, the Demonic Beast could know what was occurring a thousand li away, so she naturally knew to put it to good use.\u201cA group of humans and a Demonic Beast pack encountered each other, but it was solved quickly. The strength of that group is much stronger than your group.\u201d Mo Yan laid on Lou Mu Yan's shoulder and replied lazily.Lou Mu Yan stroked her chin, and the corner of her lips rose into an arc. The group of people ahead should undoubtedly be the pupils of the Ten Distinguished Clans.Not long after, Lan Si sent a signal to continue ahead, so Ji Xuan rushed over with everyone.After passing through the woods, one saw many Tier 3 and 4 Demonic Beast corpses lying in the open ground. There were some people sitting separately onclean grass, and they appeared to be a small team.\u201cYou guys come to rest as well for a bit.\u201d Lan Si pointed to a clean, open space to let the students of Yan'zhou Kingdom rest, while he, himself, stood with two middle-aged men to chat, seeming to be acquaintances.Lou Mu Yan swept the two groups of people and a smile rose in her eyes, but she didn't take the initiative to step forward. When she walked to the place Lan Si designated, and just as she was about to sit, there was a sound of surprise that entered her ears.\u201cMu Yan!\u201d When Ye Qing Han sat in his place to rest, he had heard that the students who participated in the Trial competition from Yan'zhou Kingdom also came. He only thought to glance over casually, but didn't expect to see the beautiful, otherworldly, white-clothed woman in the crowd.Lou Mu Yan stopped in her steps, turned her head, and smiled charmingly, \u201cQing Han!\u201dThe familiar greeting between the two surprised everyone in the woods\u2014especially the few women who had been sitting in the clearing as they looked at Lou Mu Yan with dislike in their eyes.Ye Qing Yan patted the young woman beside him, then they stood up and walked towards Lou Mu Yan.\u201cMu Yan, long time no see!\u201d Ye Qing Yan was still dressed in his dark-pattered black robe with a rare smile on his handsome face.Lou Mu Yan nodded, her eyes dyed with a smile, \u201cLong time no see!\u201d\u201cElder brother, is she the elder sister Mu Yan you spoke of?\u201d The sweet-looking and petite girl who stood beside Ye Qing Han asked with a smile.\u201cYes, she's Lou Mu Yan.\u201d Ye Qing Han's voice carried a bit of pampering, then introduced to Lou Mu Yan, \u201cMu Yan, this is my little sister, Ye Qing Le.\u201d\u201cElder sister Mu Yan, you're so beautiful!\u201d Ye Qing Le blinked at Lou Mu Yan with a natural familiarity. She didn't know why, but just liked this woman, that her elder brother spoke of constantly, at first glance.\u201cQing Le is also very beautiful!\u201d Lou Mu Yan nodded and smiled cordially.The friendliness of the girl opposite her didn't appear to be fake, so a sense of intimacy was also birthed unconsciously in Lou Mu Yan's heart. Perhaps this was simply fate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was difficult to see him reveal a smile from the bottom of his heart to anyone.Ye Qing Le, the little princess of the Ye Family, had a very lively and cheerful appearance, but she rarely truly approved of anyone. No one had ever seen her display the intimacy that she did today towards anyone.Many people were puzzled by the attitude of the Ye Clan's brother and sister towards Lou Mu Yan. Those who didn't know Lou Mu Yan's identity were all wondering who she was.It was the first time for Xue Ling and Xin Ying Xuan to see Ye Qing Han display such a gentle side to a woman. In particular, the joy and warm colour in his eyes pricked their eyes.Xin Ying Xuan had already found out Lou Mu Yan's identity before. From her point of view, this woman was just a fallen noble. The only thing that made her fear was the mysterious 'Master' behind Lou Mu Yan.Originally, she wanted to immediately get rid of Lou Mu Yan, but the other party had the Marrow Cleansing Pill. After the superiors of the Ten Distinguished Clans received this news, the moment this Trial ended, they would definitely go to Yan'zhou Kingdom to discuss this matter. The Elder of her Clan also warned her not to make a move without permission and lose a great opportunity because of something small.Xin Ying Xuan's eyes were grim. After she was warned by the Clan, she decided to temporarily let Lou Mu Yan go and wait for the Xin Clan to obtain the Marrow Cleansing Pill first before killing her. But now looking at Ye Qing Han's attitude towards Lou Mu Yan, her heart was burning with jealously. She just wanted to rush up and scratch open that gorgeous face of hers completely.\u201cElder brother Mu Bai, Mu Yan.\u201d At this time, several people from the Ling Clan also walked over from another direction. The leader was a red-haired young man and a gentle woman in plain clothes.\u201cFei Hao, Fei Li.\u201d A warm colour flashed across Lou Mu Bai's eyes.Lou Mu Yan also smiled and addressed: \u201cElder cousin brother, elder cousin sister.\u201dThe two of them were precisely the most promising of the younger generation in the Ling Clan, Ling Fei Hao and Ling Fei Li. They were Lou Mu Yan's second uncle and third uncle's child respectively. They were two years older than her, and they treated her fairly nicely.Towards the rest that followed the two, Lou Mu Yan didn't have a strong impression. She supposed that they were the pupils of the Ling Clan who just came to participate in the Selection Trial and wasn't from the main bloodline.Only when they saw Ling Fei Hao and Ling Fei Li greet Lou Mu Yan, did many talents of the Ten Distinguished Clans realise her identity. But they still wondered how Ye Qing Han and Lou Mu Yan met. The relationship between the two was obviously not shallow.\u201cI've long heard my maternal grandfather say that Mu Yan's Terminal Meridians constitution had been eradicated. But it was unexpected that we'd meet in this Trial. I hope we can participate in the Continental Tournament for Hegemony together.\u201d Ling Fei Hao's sunny and energetic face revealed a lovely dimple.Ling Fei Li beside him glared at him, \u201cWe'll speak of these matters in private.\u201dThis little boy spoke regardless of occasion. Didn't he see everyone's eyes were cast on them?\u201cLet's find a place to have a conversation first.\u201d Ling Fei Hao was just too excited to see the Lou brother and sister, so now that he had calmed down, he proposed.Lou Mu Bai nodded and smiled gently at the Ye Clan's brother and sister, \u201cMu Yan, you should accompany your friends and have chat.\u201dHe could see that Ye Qing Han was looking for Lou Mu Yan for something. Although he didn't know how they met, but as long as the other party wasn't malicious, then it was fine.\u201cAlright. I'll chat a little with Qing Han and Qing Le. Eldest brother, you guys talk first.\u201dThen, Lou Mu Bai and the people from the Ling Clan walked to a distant grassy area to sit and chat, while Lou Mu Yan's arm was wrapped around by Qing Le's and was pulled under a large tree not far away. Ye Qing Han erected an Elemental Energy soundproof barrier.Seeing Ye Qing Han's hesitate in speaking, Lou Mu Yan understood. She took Qing Le's hand to take her pulse, \u201cLet me take a look at Qing Le's body first.\u201dYe Qing Le was plagued by years of disease, and this time, it was because she had taken a pill the Clan's Alchemist had refined that could temporarily suppress the foetal poison, that she could follow into the Glacial Mountain Range.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksShe had long heard from her elder brother and Old Lu that Lou Mu Yan had excelling medical skills. Elder brother had even successfully advanced to the Sword King stage because he took the Marrow Cleansing Pill that Lou Mu Yan gifted. So she had long wanted to see the woman they constantly spoke of.Sure enough, she didn't disappoint at first glance today. She had a good impression of this woman who was only a year older than herself.Now that Lou Mu Yan wanted to check her pulse for her illness, she relaxed her body and allowed her to check.After changing Ye Qing Le's hand and continue to check her pulse, Lou Mu Yan's brows furrowed together slightly. Then, after a while, she let go and fell into deep contemplation.\u201cMu Yan, how is it? Can Qing Le's poison be cured?\u201d Seeing Lou Mu Yan furrow her brows, worry couldn't help but rise from Ye Qing Han's heart.Ye Qing Le was more optimistic. Since she was a child, she knew that she might not live past twenty years old, so this time she begged the superiors in the Clan to allow her to follow her elder brother to experience the outside world, \u201cElder sister Mu Yan, I've been living with this chronic illness for years, if there's no solution, then it's also normal.\u201dLou Mu Yan was just thinking deeply about how to cure Ye Qing Le's poison, yet who knew that it'd cause a misunderstanding from the two. She smiled back and said: \u201cAlthough the foetal poison in your body is deep, but it hasn't corroded to the internal organs yet. As long as you cure it within a year, then it'll be fine. If we drag the time longer than a year, the foetal poison flowing in your blood will slowly corrode your internal organs, and by then it'll be more troublesome.\u201d\u201cThen you mean Qing Le could still be saved now?\u201d A light burst from Ye Qing Han's eyes.Ye Qing Le froze and a look of hope rose in her eyes as she stared at Lou Mu Yan, waiting for her answer.Although she had a cheerful and optimistic temperament, but every time the foetal poison erupted within her, she always had the urge to commit suicide. If it weren't for her family, then she would've long been unable to continue to live. Now, if there was a way to completely eradicate the poison from within her body, then it would be the best result for her and her family.\u201cYes, she can be saved. But because the poison had already blended with her blood, it'll be a bit troublesome to deal with. I still need to refine an antidote pill to be used together with the Golden Needle Treatment.\u201dLou Mu Yan paused, then added: \u201cIt's just that I think the treatment should be postponed until after this Trial is over.\u201dYe Qing Le's foetal poison wasn't difficult to solve, it was just troublesome to handle. During the treatment, it also required her to treat Ye Qing Le with needles every day for a month. In the Glacial Mountain Range, they would separate immediately to complete their own Trials, so she couldn't be treated.\u201cNo hurry. I've been like this for so many years, I don't care about waiting a little more.\u201d Ye Qing Le was happy. She didn't expect that Lou Mu Yan really had a way to treat the foetal poison in her body. This made her feel a sense of hope that had never risen in her heart before.Ye Qing Han also revealed some excitement in his eyes, \u201cEverything's fine as long as it can be cured!\u201d\u201cDon't worry, I can cure this poison, I promise!\u201dLou Mu Yan could deeply feel the pain of having a chronic illness. Judging from Ye Qing Le's foetal poison, she would have an outbreak of intolerable pain almost every two months. To be able to live until now and still maintain such an optimistic temperament, it meant that Ye Qing Le was extremely tough. She admired such a girl very much.\u201cMu Yan, a mere 'thank you' is an insufficient response to such a huge favour!\u201d Ye Qing Han thought for a while and popped out this sincere sentence.Lou Mu Yan lowered her head and chuckled, then raised her head and looked at him jokingly, \u201cI still haven't treated Qing Le yet, your thanks is too early.\u201d\u201cI believe you!\u201d Ye Qing Han's handsome, sharp and angular face revealed unconditional trust. Since the time they went to the Blazing Mountain Range together, an inexplicable feeling of trust grew in him towards this woman.\u201cElder sister Mu Yan, I believe you too!\u201d Ye Qing Le smiled beautifully, with trust in her eyes.Lou Mu Yan's eyes were also dyed with a layer of deep warmth. She was very touched by this trust and was happy from the bottom of her heart.Random Note: BTW anyone reading on mtlnovel website and giving all those 5-star reviews, if any one of you happen to be here, wow, thanks!

They laughed and chatted for a while, and both felt as if they've met each other far too late.When Ye Qing Han was about to separate from Lou Mu Yan, he suddenly leaned close to her ear and whispered: \u201cThe Glacial Mountain Range hasn't been peaceful recently. Be careful when you complete your missions. If you meet people outside of Yan'zhou Kingdom and the Ten Distinguished Clans, try your best to avoid them.\u201dLou Mu Yan revealed confusion in her eyes, bit didn't ask more, nodded and said:\u00a0\u201cAlright, you two take care too!\u201dSoon, the Ye Clan's brother and sister returned to the place where the people of the Ye Clan who participated in the Trial gathered. Lou Mu Yan also went to where the Ling Clan's people were and sat down.\u201cMu Yan, you know the brother and sister of the Ye Clan?\u201d Ling Fei Hao turned his eyes then asked curiously.Lou Mu Yan said with a smile: \u201cYep, we've had some interactions before.\u201d\u201cYou can actually be so close to them, that's amazing.\u201d Ling Fei Hao raised a thumb up at Lou Mu Yan, then said in a whisper: \u201cThose two siblings are famous for being 'watertight' and they keep their distance from anyone, especially Ye Qing Han, he's exceptionally difficult to befriend.\u201d\u201cThere's such a thing?\u201d Lou Mu Yan remembered that when she first met Ye Qing Han, he definitely felt distant, but afterwards, when they went to the Blazing Mountain Range, that sense of distance gradually faded, and they even became friends with a bit of tacit understanding. She had never felt that it was difficult to approach Ye Qing Han.Ling Fei Hao leaned towards Lou Mu Yan and said: \u201cThere are three people who are considered the most difficult to approach in the Ten Distinguished Clans. Do you know which three?\u201dLou Mu Yan cooperated with Ling Fei Hao in amusement, \u201cI don't know, which three?\u201d Ye Qing Han counts as one?\u201d She found that this elder cousin brother of hers was too lively and full of energy.\u201cYep, Ye Qing Han counts as one, and there's two other people. Look over at the group of people sitting across from us. The expressionless man sitting on the very edge, wearing a black brocade robe, is the most highly valued genius of the Clan ranked number one of the Distinguished Clans, the Shi Clan's1\u00a0Shi Feng.\u201d Ling Fei Hao gestured with his mouth, indicating to the opposite direction.Lou Mu Yan glanced over with her peripheral vision and found that the man named Shi Feng was leaning against a big tree alone with his eyes closed, without any expression on his face. But she felt a familiar feeling from him.\u201cHe's an Alchemist?\u201d Lou Mu Yan remembered that this familiar feeling originated from the scent of medicine that exuded from him, so she turned her head and asked Ling Fei Hao.She was exceptionally sensitive to smell. Earlier, when she passed by the area where the Shi Clan was, she smelled a light medicinal scent that was from Shi Feng.\u201cOf course. The Shi Clan is known for their Alchemy across Tian'ling Continent. Obviously he's an Alchemist.\u201d Ling Fei Hao glanced towards Shi Feng and there was a touch of admiration in his eyes, \u201cHe's now a Grade 3 Alchemist. Nineteen-years-old and already a Grade 3 Alchemist, isn't that amazing? He's known as the first person in the Eastern Region to have such high levels of mastery in Alchemy in many years.\u201d\u201cMany Alchemists have a weird temper, so it's normal if they're hard to interact with.\u201d Lou Mu Yan herself had interacted with many Alchemists, so she naturally knew a bit about how some Alchemists didn't like to deal with people. They spent all their time indulged in Alchemy. The feeling that Shi Feng gave her was as such.This kind of indulgence was different to Huo Xiao's indulgence in Smithing. She had seen people like Shi Feng before, and he should be one who truly loved the pleasure and accomplishment when Spiritual Herbs were successfully refined into pills. They pursued perfection and strived to refine the best pill as their lifelong goal.Ling Fei Hao pursed his lips and said: \u201cIt's not just because he's an Alchemist, he's just got face paralysis2. His face is expressionless all year round. Basically no one's seen him show any excessive emotions.\u201dLou Mu Yan smiled speechlessly, considering that to be her acquiescence, then asked: \u201cAnd the last person?\u201d\u201cAnd the last person's the man in scarlet clothes sitting not far from your teacher. His name is Mu Yi and is the Young Lord of the Mu Clan that's ranked third in the Ten Distinguished Clans. He's also a Grade 3 Smith.\u201cThe most important thing is that he's already comprehended three different Elemental Energy attributes already. Although he's only at Peak-Phase Sword King cultivation base, but it's said that he already has the strength to fight a Sword Monarch.\u201d Ling Fei Hao added.Lou Mu Yan raised her eyes and glanced in Mu Yi's direction. Coincidentally, their eyes met as he lifted his. The two looked at each other, then each retrieved their gazes, \u201cThat person seems to be smiling all the time, how did you judge that he's difficult to interact with?\u201d\u201cIt's precisely because he's smiling all the time that he's hard to interact with. Because he's a smiling tiger who treats everyone with politeness, regardless of who it is. It's a different tune to Ye Qing Han's distance, but with the same results3.\u201d Ling Fei Hao said as he raised an eyebrow.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksLou Mu Yan looked at him, amused, \u201cElder cousin brother, I realise you're really bored.\u201d\u201cPfft, Mu Yan, so you realised too! He just studies these boring things every day, and he doesn't listen to us no matter what we say.\u201d Ling Fei Li beside him couldn't help but laugh aloud.Ling Fei Hao huffed, \u201cI'm just studying my opponents, you guys don't understand.\u201dLou Mu Yan and Ling Fei Li exchanged a look and saw the smile in each other's eyes. However, she did obtain two pieces of information from Ling Fei Hao's short gossip, which could be considered a gain.The several people chatted about the Ling Clan and the Ten Distinguished Clans, then the middle-aged man that was standing with Lan Si suddenly clapped his hands and said: \u201cThe Trial members of the Ten Distinguished Clans will gather and set off in a quarter of an hour.\u201dLing Fei Hao revealed a look of reluctance\u2014they had only met for a little bit and now had to separate again. Lou Mu Bai patted his shoulder with a light smile, \u201cFei Hao, this time you need to bring glory to the Ling Clan. Maybe we'll meet again within the later parts of the Trial.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201d Hearing Lou Mu Bai's words, Ling Fei Hao nodded solemnly.The current situation of the Ling Clan wasn't really optimistic. He and Ling Fei Li were the main force of the Ling Clan's Trial this time, and they couldn't make the Ling Clan lose face.Lou Mu Yan thought a bit, then took out a few packets of powdered drugs from her interspatial ring and stuffed them in their hands, saying: \u201cThese powdered drugs can deal with the Demonic Beasts and paralyse them for a few breaths. You can use these at critical times.\u201cThis is the Elemental Energy Replenishing Pill4\u00a0which can quickly replenish your Elemental Energy when you've depleted it.\u201d Then she handed two more bottles of Elemental Energy Nourishing Pills to the two as well.She believed that as the main targets of training in the Ten Distinguished Clans, they wouldn't lack pills with these types of effects. However, there's a shortage of Alchemists on this Continent, and pills were even scarcer. So presumably they wouldn't have a lot on them either.The people of the Ling Clan all treated Lou Mu Yan very well, so this could be considered her returning the favour.\u201cWow, Mu Yan, you actually have so many good things.\u201d Ling Fei Hao quickly put the things away and said with big smiles: \u201cYour Master really is nice to you.\u201dAlthough she saw that he had misunderstood, but Lou Mu Yan didn't explain, \u201cYou just take good hold of it. After the Trial ends, I'll go to the Ling Clan to visit elder cousin brother Fei Yang.\u201dSpeaking of Ling Fei Yang, the eyes of the people in the Ling Clan unanimously displayed a bit of sadness. If Ling Fei Yang could also participate in the Selection Trial this time, they believed he definitely would be able to lead them to win a few more places for the competition.\u201cDon't be discouraged. Elder cousin brother Fei Yang will definitely get better. I believe he also hopes to see you all return successfully.\u201d Lou Mu Yan had confidence in curing Ling Fei Yang, but now wasn't a good time to say it. Seeing the few people a little dispirited, she squeezed her fists in encouragement.\u201cMu Yan's right. We must do our best to win glory for the Ling Clan.\u201d Ling Fei Li's delicate face revealed a gentle smile, then she looked at Lou Mu Yan and Lou Mu Bai, saying: \u201cYou both be careful on your journey. I heard that the Trial this time isn't that simple. Take care!\u201d\u201cYou guys take care too!\u201dAfter separating from Ling Fei Hao and the others, Lou Mu Yan and Lou Mu Bai returned to where the students of Yan'zhou Kingdom were. But before they could sit down, they saw Shi Feng walk over.He stood in front of Lou Mu Yan, looked at her expressionlessly and asked: \u201cYou are Lou Mu Yan from the General's Mansion of Yan'zhou Kingdom?\u201d1author typed 'Feng Clan' here, but pretty sure it's a typo lol. Think there were at least another typo somewhere, but yeah. No wonder MTL gets even more mixed up sometimes hahaha.2it's a colloquial description in China and kind of makes fun of all those 'cool, cold, expressionless' male leads that always appear in dramas lol. In particular used to refer to men who act cool and usually to make fun of them for pretending to act like that.3pretty straightforward, but it is an idiom that translates literally to 'different tunes sung with equal skill' aka 'different approaches but equally satisfactory results'.4the same as 'Spiritual Energy Replenishing Pill'. Probably an insignificant note, but yeah hahaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 83: The Start of the Trial\u00a0MissionsLou Mu Yan watched Shi Feng walk over, but she didn't expect that this person would talk to her.Although Shi Feng was expressionless, but she could feel that he wasn't hostile. She nodded calmly: \u201cI'm Lou Mu Yan. Something the matter?\u201d\u201cI heard that you have a pill called the Marrow Cleansing Pill?\u201d Only when Shi Feng mention pills was there a slight fluctuation in his usually calm eyes.Lou Mu Yan's expression didn't change: \u201cYes, but I don't have anymore now.\u201d\u201cDo you have the pill recipe for the Marrow Cleansing Pill? I can exchange it with you for a high-level Grade 3 pill recipe.\u201d This was the first time that Shi Feng ever mentioned wanting to make such a transaction with anyone.He was very excited when he heard about the efficacy of the Marrow Cleansing Pill. The pill recipe of a pill that had such an effect, defying normalcy, was something no Alchemist could refuse. He didn't know whether Lou Mu Yan would agree to his proposal or not, but he wanted to give it a try regardless.\u201cI don't. The pill recipe of the Marrow Cleansing Pill is in my Master's hands.\u201d Lou Mu Yan shrugged and expressed helplessness.Recently, many people desired her Marrow Cleansing Pill, but Shi Feng seemed to only be interested in the pill recipe.If it were someone else, they might be tempted by the deal he proposed. After all, it wouldn't be a disadvantage to exchange a Grade 2 pill recipe for a Grade 3 High-Level pill recipe. But in her head, there existed unique pill recipes that don't even exist on this Continent, so how could she be tempted by Shi Feng's Grade 3 pill recipe.Shi Feng appeared to have expected it, but he was still a little bit disappointed. He fell silent for a while, then said to Lou Mu Yan with a calm expression: \u201cIf you want to trade in the future, you can come to the Shi Clan to find me.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Lou Mu Yan didn't refuse either.\u201cThen excuse me!\u201d Shi Feng said politely before turning to leave.Lou Mu Yan quickly withdrew her gaze that was on him. This person sure was quite polite.After Shi Feng left, she found an empty space and sat down, ignoring the gazes that were cast on her from all directions. She calmly took out a soft and delicious pastry from her interspatial ring to eat.A quarter of an hour later, the Trial teams of the Ten Distinguished Clans quickly gathered and hurried to the boundary between the outer ring and the periphery of the Glacial Mountain Range.Only the people of Yan'zhou Kingdom who participated in the Trial and the Demonic Beast corpses scattered around remained. Lan Si also returned to the team.He nipped a piece of tea pastry from Lou Mu Yan and sent it to his moth, then said with a smile: \u201cLou Mu Yan, you made these yourself?\u201d\u201cYeah, it's made with Spiritual Tea.\u201d Lou Mu Yan didn't know from where Lan Si could tell that the pastries were made by herself, but she didn't conceal it either.\u201cIt tastes pretty good.\u201d Lan Si took another piece and swallowed it.Lou Mu Yan guessed that he still had something to say, so she didn't respond, and just smiled faintly.\u201cAren't you going to breakthrough? It's dangerous after we enter the boundary between the outer ring and the inner ring.\u201d Lan Si slowly took out a handkerchief and wiped the corners of his mouth and hands, then tossed it away casually. The handkerchief vanished with the wind without a trace.Lou Mu Yan pursed her lips, \u201cMaybe, during our next rest.\u201dThe Spiritual Energy had already reached its peak within her, and her cultivation base had already reached a bottleneck. It was only because it was inconvenient to immediately advance in the Glacial Mountain Range, that's why she had been suppressing her cultivation base. Since Lan Si reminded her so kindly, then she had nothing to hide either.The corners of Lan Si's lips raised, and he didn't say anymore. Only after resting for almost two hours and after feeling that the distance between them and the team ahead had lengthened, did he tell everyone to rise and keep going.While on the way, Lou Mu Yan saw that Yun Lan wanted to talk to her, but was hesitating, so she said first, \u201cElder Cousin Brother has something to tell me?\u201d\u201cIt's nothing big, I just wanted to ask, you're very familiar with Ye Qing Han?\u201d\u201cYeah, we can be considered friends.\u201d Lou Mu Yan nodded with a smile.Yun Lan fell silent for a while, then said: \u201cThen, Mu Yan, can you help me arrange a battle him to exchange pointers?\u201d\u201cElder Cousin Brother, why do you insist on exchanging pointers with Ye Qing Han?\u201d Lou Mu Yan had always been curious as to why Yun Lan wanted to chase after Ye Qing Han so persistently.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cHis skill attributes are the same as mine. Every time I finish fighting with him, I'll always have some comprehensions. It just so happens that my current sword skill is at a bottleneck.\u201d Yun Lan explained.He wasn't that familiar with Ye Qing Han, and it was only accidental that they fought twice before. If he went to arrange a battle with Ye Qing Han, he feared that he would misunderstand, so he wanted to ask Lou Mu Yan for help.Lou Mu Yan smiled in understanding now and said: \u201cSo it's like that. Then after the Trial, I'll help you ask him.\u201dEither way, after the Trial's over, she needed to go to the Ye Clan for a month, so it was fine to take an extra person. Ye Qing Han presumably wouldn't reject either.\u201cAlright, then I'll trouble Mu Yan.\u201dAlong the way, they encountered countless attacks from Demonic Beasts, and even a few Tier 4 Demonic Beasts that lead groups, but they were all avoided.Of course, the effect of Lou Mu Yan's powdered drug took half the credit.They hurried on with their journey while killing Demonic Beasts and seven days passed. The group of talents arrived at the border between the forest and icy mountains.Lan Si and the other instructors took them to a place at the foot of the icy mountains. There sat a wooden hut, and after entering, a warm current spread towards them.In the middle of the wooden hut, there was a stove, and above the stove rose wisps of steam. There was also a kettle atop of it, and a white-haired old man sat before it\u2014Yun Cang.\u201cYou're all here. Take a seat.\u201d Yun Cang raised his eyes and nodded to everyone.Lan Si and the few instructors sat down, then the students all found a random spot to sit.\u201cLou girl, I heard that you have quite good temaking skills. Come and make a pot.\u201dLou Mu Yan lowered her eyes, pulled Lou Mu Bai together to sit beside Yun Cang, then said: \u201cYes.\u201dYun Cang smiled, took out a box of Spiritual Tea from his interspatial ring and handed it to Lou Mu Yan.Lou Mu Yan took the Spiritual Tea and as soon as she opened the lid, a rich and fragrant smell wafted to her nose. She took a few spoonsful out and started to brew tea.As expected from the Imperial Teacher of Yan'zhou Kingdom, the quality of this Spiritual Tea was much better than the quality of the tea she obtained from Shopkeeper Lu.Lou Mu Yan's actions that were like moving clouds and flowing water were very pleasing to the eye. Then she listened to Yun Cang's order and poured everyone a cup.Yun Cang's value of Lou Mu Yan and his different attitude towards her made most of the other students astounded, and they all reassessed Lou Mu Yan in their hearts.Yun Cang took a sip from his teacup and his eyes revealed some satisfaction, then said rather slowly towards everyone: \u201cStarting today, your Trial truly begins.\u201cYour first mission. Within five days, each of you must go out and kill at least ten Tier 5 Demonic Beasts and come back. You can team up to complete the mission, or you can snatch it from other people, but you aren't allowed to kill each other.\u201cAfter five days, come here to meet us. If you don't reach the number, you will be eliminated automatically. Then a small team from the Imperial Family will escort the eliminated people back to the Imperial Capital.\u201d\u201cYes, Imperial Teacher!\u201dHearing the first task issued, every student participating in the Trial here were all feeling ambitious and fervent.\u201cBy the way, you need to complete this operation alone or in any team. The instructors will no longer accompany you throughout, so pay attention to your own safety. If you die here, then everything will be over for you!\u201cI hope that you will all stay alive.\u201d Yun Cang drank all the tea in the cup and with a serious expression, \u201cRest for a night, and you'll leave early tomorrow morning. Whether you complete the mission or not, five days later, before this time, report back.\u201d\u201cWe will follow the instructions of the Imperial Teacher!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 84: Spiritual Force Body\u00a0TemperingAfter everyone scattered, Lou Mu Yan greeted Lou Mu Bai before walking to sit cross-legged atop a large tree with dense foliage not far from the wooden house.She closed her eyes and the Spiritual Energy within her body performed a few macrocosmic orbits, placing her whole body and mind in a free and empty state. One night was enough for her to advance.Streams of Spiritual Force came from all directions and quickly entered her body. A faint green force encircled her dan'tian, full of vitality.Above her head, in the sky, clusters of Spiritual Clouds gathered, and lightning bolts descended from the Spiritual Clouds, striking each of Lou Mu Yan's meridians. The Spiritual Force continuously tempered her body.Dazzling lights like coloured glaze shone down on her through the dense leaves, making the gorgeous, white-clothed young girl appear as if a stunning celestial that had descended, rippling in light and enigmatic as if behind a layer of mist.And this sight naturally stirred everyone who was resting within the wooden hut. They leapt out of the house, looked in Lou Mu Yan's direction, and were completely stunned.\u201cThis\u2014This is Spiritual Force Body Tempering?\u201d A student stammered out.\u201cIsn't Lou Mu Yan's talent a bit too strong? She's only advancing but can actually attract Spiritual Force Body Tempering. Isn't it that only the legendary constitution can cause such an anomalous phenomenon of Heaven and earth?\u201d A member of the Imperial Family said in disbelief.\u201cShe doesn't have a special or rare constitution, but it's said that people with the Terminal Meridians Constitution are actually extremely talented and Heaven-defying. It's just that it's been stopped by their Terminal Meridians. So after eradicating the Terminal Meridians Constitution, her talents and aptitudes are gradually revealed.\u201d\u201cThis truly is the so-called 'interdependence of blessings and misfortunes'. The Lou Mu Yan after eradicating the Terminal Meridians Constitution, compared to the trash from before, are like two different people, she\u2026\u201dThe students were discussing constantly, and they all sighed with mixed emotions at Lou Mu Yan's good fortune.Yun Cang, Lan Si and Yun Ji were also standing outside the hut, looking at the anomalous phenomena occurring at that large tree.Every time a Spiritual Cloud scattered, there would be even more that floated over. It was as if the white-clothed woman shrouded in a colourful glaze had a dan'tian that was a bottomless pit, incessantly absorbing the Spiritual Force of Heaven and earth. Its speed was truly breathtaking.\u201cImperial Teacher, Lou Mu Yan really doesn't have the Heavenly Spiritual Body?\u201d Yun Ji looked at Yun Cang in confusion, asking.He had never seen anyone who could attract the Spiritual Force Body Tempering anomalous phenomenon when they were advancing. Such an anomalous phenomenon was only a legendary existence, yet he didn't expect to see it today occurring on the infamous trash of the Empire.Yun Cang's gaze was deep, and with a rare smile on his face, he sighed: \u201cShe does indeed not have the Heavenly Spiritual Body, but she has excelling talent that is no less than a Heavenly Spiritual Body. The future of this girl is immeasurable.\u201dThen, Yun Cang looked at Lan Si with a serious expression and ordered: \u201cNo accident can occur to Lou Mu Yan during this Trial.\u201dWhether it was the Master behind Lou Mu Yan, or the excelling cultivation and Alchemy talents that she displayed, it all decided that she would be an extraordinary person in the future. The Empire could not lose such a talent.\u201cI will protect her secretly.\u201d Lan Si nodded, \u201cBut all the missions in the Trial need to be completed by herself, so I will not take action until a life-or-death moment.\u201d\u201cThat is only of course. If she can't even pass such a Trial, then it would be a waste of her good aptitude.\u201d A sharp glint flashed in Yun Cang's eyes, \u201cI just have a feeling that she can win a Trial quota this time.\u201d\u201cI hope so!\u201d The gaze that Lan Si cast towards Lou Mu Yan revealed a hint of extreme interest.After a few hours, Lou Mu Yan's Spiritual Energy soared. She opened her tightly shut eyes and formed a few hand-seals before her. The few Spiritual Clouds that remained in the sky were absorbed by her and the layer of thin film that blocked her advancement in her dan'tian was broken by the flooding of Elemental Energy.[WENG!!] A huge amount of Spiritual Energy poured into her dan'tian, and the light green mist expanded in size.Only after performing a few cosmic orbits in her body, was Lou Mu Yan's advancement complete. Feeling the abundant and deep Spiritual Energy within her, a confident smile rose on her lips.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksAlthough she was only at a Sword Spirit cultivation base, but the Spiritual Energy in her body wasn't inferior to that of an Initial-Phase Sword King Sword Master. Now she had another layer of guarantee for the upcoming Trial mission.Then Lou Mu Yan finished and glanced in the direction of the wooden hut with furrowed brows. There, countless pairs of eyes were staring at her, transfixed, making her feel very helpless.After eradicating her Terminal Meridians constitution, her potential talent was even better than those pampered children with special constitutions. And because of her unique Flesh Refining Manual, every time she advanced, she would attract the anomalous phenomena of Heaven and earth where Spiritual Clouds would send lightning to temper her body. She suddenly felt a headache because the scene of her advancement was too big.She didn't like being watched and liked to cause trouble even less. But as long as she could refine the Foundation Establishment Pill and take it, after successfully establishing her foundation, she could create a sight where it would conceal and isolate the anomalous phenomena of Heaven and earth during advancement from the outside world.She ignored the gazes of those people. Right now, she was bound to be questioned if she walked over, so she continued to sit on the tree and close her eyes to rest.It wasn't until when the time came for the mission to start did Lou Mu Yan jump off the branch and leave with Lou Mu Bai and the rest.After separating from the other Trial students, Yun Lan took out a beast-skin map and carefully checked it.\u201cA'Lan, you actually have a map of the outer ring and inner ring of the Glacial Mountain Range.\u201d Xiao Zi Ang looked at the beast-skin map and said in surprise.Yun Lan looked at the beast-skin map carefully then explained: \u201cThis is from my Master.\u201dAfter hearing that it was given by Yun Lan's Master, Xiao Zi Ang said excitedly with a smile: \u201cThen are there marked locations for the Tier 5 Demonic Beasts we need to find?\u201dYun Lan's Master was\u00a0that\u00a0Sword Sovereign expert of the Empire that was currently in Closed-Door Cultivation, and also Yan'zhou Kingdom's strongest Sword Master. It was also because of his support that Yan'zhou Kingdom wasn't completely reduced to the ranks of a small country.\u201cYep, there are rough coordinates.\u201d Yun Lan said to them after confirming a few points on the map: \u201cThere's a Tier 5 Ice Ape to the east of the mountain and it's also the closest place to us. Let's go there for the mission first.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201dTheir little team consisted of Yun Lan, Yun Jin, Xiao Zi Ang, Yun Luo, Chi Yi Xuan and the two siblings of the Lou Clan. Their strengths were relatively prominent among the Trial teams.With Yun Lan's map, the efficiency would be improved a lot, so it wouldn't be difficult for them to complete the missions. It saved time and trouble. Five days was enough.\u201cElder Cousin Brother, are there marked locations of Spiritual Herbs?\u201d Lou Mu Yan asked in a whisper when she walked beside Yun Lan.Yun Lan nodded: \u201cYes, but not complete. There's only markings for Spiritual Herbs that are being protected by Demonic Beasts.\u201d\u201cCan I take a look?\u201d Lou Mu Yan's eyes lit up like stars. A Spiritual Herb like the Deep Orchid would definitely be guarded by a Demonic Beast.Yun Lan smiled, took out the beast-skin map from his chest area1\u00a0and handed it to Lou Mu Yan. Then he pointed to a few places where only one word was written, saying: \u201cThese are the places.\u201d\u201cThere's the word 'orchid2' here, does it represent the Deep Orchid?\u201d Lou Mu Yan stared at the place marked on the map with the word 'orchid' as her heart skipped a beat.\u201cYes, the Deep Orchid can only be found in the Glacial Mountain Range. It's extremely rare and precious. According to my Master's notes, the Demonic Beast guarding it is a Peak-Phase Tier 5 Cold-Mist Jiao3. It's also the King of the northwest area.\u201d Yun Lan was very familiar with the things marked on the map. His Master had explained it all to him one by one before coming.Lou Mu Yan pointed to a few other markings and asked at random, but she noted down the Deep Orchid's direction and location in her heart.1probably an unnecessary explanation but you know how in ancient China, people wore robe-like clothes? (love them btw, they're so pretty!) Anyways, obviously you wrap one side of the robe over the other side to wear it, so there's a slit there to put things. Often in Chinese dramas you'd see them take things out from their chest area. Women are often seen taking things out from their sleeves.2the actual character is '\u5170' from '\u6df1\u5e7d\u5170', which is 'Deep Orchid'.3ok, based on my many years of reading Chinese novels, the word used here to describe the animal '\u86df' means a being that is more than a snake but less than a dragon. I did a brief Google and Baidu search and it came up with '\u86df\u9f99' amongst some other answers which is translated as a 'flood dragon'. \u86df are thought to be beings that are related to water only. A \u86df can eventually evolve to become a true dragon, however. There's no real English translation except 'dragon', but it's not quite. So I'm leaving it as it is haha.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 85: How\u00a0ViolentLou Mu Yan and her party quickly arrived at the Ice Ape's cave marked on the map. Sure enough, they felt three Tier 5 Demonic Beast auras in the depths of the cave.Outside the cave, groups of low-level Ice Apes were walking back and forth. Yun Lan made a gesture to the others with his hands, took out a longsword, then cut through the air.The others also took out their Spirit Treasures one by one to sweep through the low-level Ice Apes outside and in only a short while, they made their way deep into the cave.[ROAR!!] Their fight also attracted the attention of the three Ice Ape Kings deep in the cave that rushed out, beating their chests.Lou Mu Yan looked at one of the Ice Ape Kings that was more than three metres high, and fighting spirit rose in her eyes.After the Spiritual Force Body Tempering and advancing to a Sword Spirit, her body's toughness also rose a level, and the Flesh Refining Technique rose a layer too. This Initial-Phase Tier 5 Demonic Beast was the perfect opponent for to practice against right now.\u201cLeave that shortest one to me.\u201d Lou Mu Yan said as she rolled her fists.\u201c\u2026\u201d Xiao Zi Ang rolled his eyes at her and said: \u201cThat's a Tier 5 Demonic Beast. Even if you did advance to Sword Spirit, you don't need to be so wild and arrogant right.\u201dLou Mu Yan glanced at him lightly, \u201cIt's not like I'm an idiot like you.\u201d After speaking, she didn't wait for anyone else to say anything, and with a flash, she just raised her fist and charged over.She leapt up and with bare hands, directly greeting the Ice Ape that charged towards her.[BOOM BOOM!] The two collided. The Ice Ape stumbled back a few steps, while Lou Mu Yan was directly slammed into the wall opposite, shaking down a lot of rubble.However, her face not only didn't have the slightest discolouration, but instead, her fighting spirit grew more and more intense. Her exquisite and gorgeous face was dyed with a layer of faint red, then with a leap, she once again, in mid-air, punched towards the Ice Ape.The Ice Ape King had already developed intelligence, so it was completely angered by such provocation from a human that was one stage lower than itself. It beat its chest and roared a few times, then similarly clenched its hands to greet that tender fist.[BANG!!] The two fists met, but neither side was jolted back this time. They continued to fight using the most primitive physical combat method, throwing punches at each other one by one.\u201cIs Lou Mu Yan still a woman?\u201d Xiao Zi Ang watched that petite and delicate woman collide and bombard that tall, thick Ice Ape, completely stupefied. And yet she wasn't at a disadvantage at all. The traces of wildness, arrogance, and that domineering manner she revealed completely startled him.Yun Jin couldn't help but twitch the corners of his mouth. He stood beside Xiao Zi Ang with folded arms as his eyes revealed some interest: \u201cHow violent! But I like it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Xiao Zi Ang held his forehead. Were there still any normal people around?He glanced around\u2014Yun Lan and Yun Luo were practicing against one, Lou Mu Bai faced another alone, Chi Yi Xuan was cleaning up the few low-level Ice Apes that they had missed, and Lou Mu Yan was just currently fighting gleefully.He couldn't help but poke Yun Jin's arm and said: \u201cIs it really fine for us to just stand here and watch the fight?\u201d\u201cWhat's wrong with that. Those who have the abilities do more work. Just let them fight first. Their hands were itching for a long time.\u201d Yun Jin raised an eyebrow indifferently, \u201cEven if we want to intervene, there's nowhere to be of use right now, so just watch.\u201dXiao Zi Ang also realised that Yun Jin's words were reasonable, so he shrugged and continued to watch the battle. From time to time, he would even nit-picked Lou Mu Yan's fight, but he couldn't help but feel admiration towards her rise within him.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThe fight developed into a completely one-sided battle. Lou Mu Bai easily beheaded the Ice Ape King he battled while Yun Lan and Yun Luo also killed the other Ice Ape without using their full strength.Seeing that the other people's battles were already over, Lou Mu Yan didn't delay any more time either.She took two steps back, moved her fingers, and one immediately saw thin red threads of Elemental Energy Condensation reveal itself from the Ice Ape's thin fur, displayed in an octagonal shape.This was the Fire Elemental Energy Array that she quietly buried on the Ice Ape's body every time her body physically clashed with the Ice Ape's. If she wanted to kill her opponent with her physical strength alone, she still couldn't do it for the time being. Of course, if she could do another Spiritual Force Body Tempering, then she could do it.Lou Mu Yan murmured a few phrases and activated the Fire Elemental Energy in the Array. The octagonal-shaped red threads began to move quickly and gradually tightened.A moment later, the red thread firmly bound the limbs of the Ice Ape, trapping it in place for the time being. At the same time, the Eye of the Array lit up brightly in red, transforming into streams of light that shot out directly towards the centre of the Ice Ape's eyebrows!The Ice Ape wailed, then its huge body fell heavily to the ground, without a single breath remaining.The few people that were originally merely standing, watching her fight were now all stunned\u2014when did she arrange this trick? They didn't notice it at all. They only knew the constant bombardment of bodies between her and the Ice Ape, but they didn't expect that she had long planted a second means to win.\u201cMu Yan, what was the matter with that trick you just used? Elemental Energy Condensation is really this powerful?\u201dYun Jin watched Lou Mu Yan's battle from start to finish but didn't notice that she used Elemental Energy Condensation. The Elemental Energy Condensation of a sword skill was what made the Yi Clan famous, but it didn't have such potent, silent, and obscure powers.Lou Mu Yan collected her spoils, and didn't conceal either, \u201cThis is an Array formed by Elemental Energy Condensation. Those thin red threads had long destroyed the meridians in the limbs of that Ice Ape. When I decide to kill it, it can also play a restraining role.\u201dShe was most famous in the Spirit World not for her Alchemy skills, but for her Arrays. She had thoroughly researched all types of Arrays and were highly adept in them. If her strength allowed her, she could even personally arrange a few Ancient Great Arrays. Even if a Sword Sovereign expert entered, she could promise that they wouldn't be able to exit.Although at the cultivation base of a Great Sword Master, she could condense the Elemental Energy within their body, but it wasn't that powerful. However, after entering the Sword Spirit Stage, she could use many different skills. An Elemental Energy Array could also be quietly assembled, making one hard to defend against it. It made fights a lot easier.Except she was currently cultivating the cultivation skills of the Immortal Cultivation World, so advancing in the levels of a Sword Master just couldn't allow her to use certain talents. Only when she established her foundation, formed a core, formed a nascent soul and so forth, like in her previous life, could she exhibit her strengths.\u201cAren't Arrays only able to be arranged with Array Flags and Array Tools?\u201d Yun Luo asked in surprised.\u201cMost Arrays do require Array Flags and Array Tools, but they can also be constructed with Elemental Energy. But not everyone can use Elemental Energy to build an Array.\u201dLou Mu Yan stretched out her hand and a red, octagonal Elemental Energy Array was easily constructed by her. She continued: \u201cBuilding an Array with Elemental Energy not only requires one to do three things at once, but also requires the talent to enter a free and empty state at any time, and make a sketch of the Array in their heart.\u201dThe Heart Array was a Secret Manual that had long been lost in the Ancient Times. She only knew it because she accidentally discovered it in an Ancient Cultivator's cave. In the Immortal Cultivation World, there wouldn't be more than ten people that could use Spiritual Energy to build an Array.In a place like Tian'ling Continent where everything was lacking, it was probably even more impossible to find a second person who could use the Heart Array.After listening to Lou Mu Yan's explanation, Yun Luo and the rest were all speechless. In the end, wasn't it that it required talent to be able to do it. They sure didn't have the ability to achieve a free and empty state of mind at any time, nor do three things at once.Lou Mu Yan was just specifically attacking them now. It only took a few months for her to advance from an Advanced-Phase Sword Novice to a Sword Spirit\u2014this sort of speed really made them, who were the so-called geniuses, yet used more than a decade, feel ashamed.She also only used the cultivation base of a Sword Spirit to defeat a Tier 5 Ice Ape that was equivalent to an Initial-Phase Sword King strength, and not only used Elemental Energy Condensation, but could also use Elemental Energy to build an Array to kill her opponent. These methods had never been heard of before.She slowly revealed to them the edges of her talents, but every time they thought that her strength and the means she displayed had already exceeded their imagination, she could attack them again with reality\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter hunting the Tier 5 Ice Apes, the group followed the closest path on the marked map and swept up and beheaded the Tier 5 Demonic Beasts required for the mission.Three days later, on a glacial plain, green trees were dotted among the vast expanse of white, and a group of Cold Vultures flew on the clearing around the trees.When Yun Zi Mo and two other teams of students rushed to the icefield, wanting to kill the Tier 5 Cold Vultures that they received information of, they saw a large group of Cold Vultures currently fighting a few people.Among the few people lead by Lou Mu Bai, two of them cleaned the low-level Cold Vulture on the periphery, while four of them faced four Tier 5 Cold Vulture Kings among the Cold Vultures.And the white-clothed woman currently in battle with a Tier 5 Cold Vulture King unexpectedly stunned them.She was agile and fast, sped swiftly beneath the wings of the Demonic Beast, blasted and slammed with her fists covered in Elemental Energy, used her body to fight head-to-head with the Tier 5 Cold Vulture King, and yet she wasn't at all at a disadvantage.Sword Masters were more adept in long-range combats because their body's toughness couldn't be compared to a Demonic Beast's, so they were weak in close-quarters combat. But Lou Mu Yan personally let them realise that the body of a human Sword Master could also be as strong and tough as a Demonic Beast.\u201cThat's Lou Mu Yan?\u201d Ji Han Xu, who stood beside Yun Zi Mo, didn't conceal the shock in his eyes. If he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, he'd absolutely never believe that Lou Mu Yan's body was so tough.Yun Zi Mo's cold eyes deepened, \u201cShe should have practiced a flesh-refining skill. But to be able to combat a Tier 5 Demonic Beast with the cultivation base of a Sword Spirit Master, and still appear to be winning, she indeed has her own strengths.\u201dThe body of a human Sword Master, compared to a Demonic Beast, was extremely fragile. A Sword Master once developed a flesh-refining skill to make up for this shortcoming, but unfortunately, these sorts of skills were not only rare to find, but it also wasn't suitable for everyone to cultivate.He guessed that Lou Mu Yan probably obtained a Flesh-Refining Manual and trained in it successfully. Otherwise it'd be impossible to have the ability and physical quality to fight against Demonic Beasts directly.\u201cCould it be the effect of the Marrow Cleansing Pill?\u201d A fiery light flashed across Ji Han Xu's eyes.Yun Zi Mo pondered for a bit before disagreeing: \u201cEven the most Heaven-defying pill couldn't cleanse the marrow\u00a0and\u00a0refine the body. The strength she displayed doesn't seem to be improved because she took a pill.\u201d\u201cBut it's undeniable that the Marrow Cleansing Pill indeed turned the famous waste of the Imperial Capital into a genius who's not at all inferior to you now.\u201d Ji Han Xu held a firm belief in the efficacy of the Marrow Cleansing Pill. Recently, the Ji Clan was also secretly negotiating with the Lou Clan, only hoping to successfully obtain the Marrow Cleansing Pill.Yun Zi Mo's eyes displayed a look of disagreement, but he didn't say more.Presumably, there were a lot of people that thought of Lou Mu Yan in that way, but he guessed that it was actually because this woman hid her talents well. He firmly believed that it was simply impossible for a person to change so drastically due to the effects of a pill alone.After eradicating the Terminal Meridians Constitution, two of the most important factors that Lou Mu Yan relied on to achieve what she did, definitely must be her own extraordinary talents and own efforts.The jealousy in Yun Ge's eyes were inadvertently revealed and was quickly caught by Qi Le Xiang who stood not far away.She lowered her eyes to cover up the changing emotions in her eyes and thought: This time, she'd definitely not allow Lou Mu Yan to return, and would help the Gu Clan get rid of this huge nuisance and trouble.The fight remained one-sided. After Lou Mu Yan sweat to her heart's content, and her body and mind were refreshed, she arranged an Elemental Energy Killing Array to trap the Cold Vulture King.The Cold Vulture King was unwilling to reveal weakness. It was trapped, but it gathered all its Demonic Energy on its sharp beak, raised its head, then lowered it, pecking towards the weakest part of Lou Mu Yan's head.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksLou Mu Yan's eyes grew cold. A layer of glaze-like jade colour enveloped her hand. She quickly backed away a few steps, then leapt forward, and her right fist that carried boundless Elemental Energy was directly inserted into the area where the Crystal Core resided, wrenching it right out.[GAH!] The Cold Vulture King's eyes bulged, and its breath stopped abruptly in its last call.After putting away the Cold Vulture King's corpse, Lou Mu Yan walked to Yun Lan and the other's side, and said with a smile: \u201cMission complete!\u201d\u201cLou Mu Yan, you little monster. You completed your first Trial mission in only three days.\u201d Xiao Zi Ang pursed his lips and said, unreconciled. Except there was a smile of admiration in his eyes.Lou Mu Yan raised an eyebrow, stretched out her hand and patted his shoulder. Then her eyes curved into a crescent shape as she smiled, \u201cBrother, I've got to remind you that you've still got seven Demonic Beasts left to complete the mission, but there's only two days left.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The corner of Xiao Zi Ang's mouth twitched. This was precisely a caustic friend that was here just to take a jab at his heart.The others couldn't help but smile. Then seeing the people on the opposite side walk towards them, Yun Lan's eyes deepened, and he greeted Yun Zi Mo: \u201cYoung Royal Uncle.\u201dYun Zi Mo's cold eyes didn't reveal much emotion. He nodded and asked: \u201cHave you all completed your missions?\u201d\u201cWe're almost done.\u201d Yun Lan turned the conversation on its head and asked with a smile: \u201cI suppose that Young Royal Uncle must have completed your Trial missions, right?\u201d\u201cNot yet. There's still three more left until completion.\u201d Yun Zi Mo answered indifferently.\u201cI say Yun Lan, aren't you all a bit unkind.\u201d Ji Han Xu stepped forward and with a smile, as if joking, said: \u201cYou guys always intercept and kill the Tier 5 Demonic Beasts. You should at least leave some soup for us brothers when you're eating the meat!\u201dXiao Zi Ang still remembered how Ji Han Xu acted against Lou Mu Bai for Yun Ge earlier, so he said: \u201cWell who told you guys to always be slower than us. Even I haven't had any soup, so don't you guys count on having any either.\u201d\u201cOh, isn't this Alchemist Xiao? You still need to drink soup? With your identity as an Alchemist, you can just beckon and call, and wouldn't there be a lot of Sword Masters who will come and hack through brambles and thorns and sweep a bunch of Tier 5 Demonic Beasts for you?\u201d A young man beside Ji Han Xu who wore fine and splendid robes sneered, with ridicule in his voice.Xiao Zi Ang choked. He did indeed have some power to rally helpers back in the Imperial Capital because of his identity as an Alchemist, but during the Trial in the Glacial Mountain Range, everyone was a child favoured by the Heavens. So who would help him sweep up Tier 5 Demonic Beasts for a few pills.The anger in his heart rose steadily. The young man across from him who spoke was also his enemy in the Imperial Capital, so to be ridiculed like this, he truly couldn't swallow the anger. Just when he was about to resolve this using force, his arm was pulled by Lou Mu Yan.\u201cAlchemist Xiao, this Miss is willing to hack through brambles and thorns to sweep up a bunch of Tier 5 Demonic Beasts for you.\u201d Lou Mu Yan's eyes curved as they carried a brightness and continued, \u201cLet alone drinking soup, let's not even leave a single Demonic Beast fur for these eyesores.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Xiao Zi Ang felt the warmth from his arms, and his heart also warmed up. Lou Mu Yan truly was loyal.\u201cLou Mu Yan, who are you saying is an eyesore?\u201d That young man who had ridiculed Xiao Zi Ang glared at her furiously.Lou Mu Yan retracted her hand on Xiao Zi Ang's arm, picked up a strand of hair on her shoulder to play with, then raised her eyes carelessly, saying: \u201cOf course it's whoever answers is the eyesore.\u201dThis person was Gu Yan Ran's admirer. He hadn't ridiculed and bullied her any less when they met before, and now he was mocking Xiao Zi Ang. Lou Mu Yan's lips curled up into a cold arc.Want to complete the mission to kill Tier 5 Demonic Beasts? Humph, with her here, this person could dream on.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If you really have that ability, then show it to us, why only talk about it.\u201dYun Ge looked unhappy, then mocked: \u201cLet's take a bet to see just who will lose.\u201dLou Mu Yan's aunt in the Imperial Palace, as the Empress, already supressed her Concubine Mother. Who expected that now the Lou Clan's little trash's strength also suppressed her. With new grudges and old grudges, it made Yun Ge feel exceptional disgust towards Lou Mu Yan.Lou Mu Yan chuckled and raised an eyebrow: \u201cThat's what you said.\u201dWas this stupid woman really an elite raised by the Imperial Family? She not only wasn't astute nor subtle, but also got angry immediately when provoked.Lou Mu Yan couldn't help but cast a sympathetic glance at Ji Han Xu. With such a pig teammate1\u00a0as his betrothed, Ji Han Xu's entire life would definitely never be boring.In fact, she didn't know that Yun Ge's concubine mother was given the cold-shoulder by Yun Tian Chen because she once acted arrogantly towards the Empress and didn't give her any face, relying on the fact that she was highly favoured by the Emperor. As Yun Ge's talent was pretty good, she was sent to cultivate in the Imperial Family's Secret Grounds. Plus, she was the princess of the Imperial Family, so many people were willing to sell her some favours, and from a young age, she was also very distant from the complexities of the Imperial Palace and hadn't interacted with a lot of secrets. That's why it raised her to be such a simplistic, stupid, and self-centred person.Ji Han Xu naturally caught Lou Mu Yan's blatant sympathetic gaze and he couldn't help but hold his forehead. He was actually being sympathised and gloated by the once most famous trash of the Imperial Capital.But looking at his betrothed's disdainful, nasty face, he couldn't help but want to wipe some tears of sympathy for himself as well\u2026He couldn't help but assist Yun Ge last time because of their relationship, but now she was acting stupid again. He really didn't have the heart to care about it anymore. After returning, he must properly mention it to the superiors of the Clan. It was best to annul this engagement.\u201cLou Mu Yan, who can't talk big? Then we'll wait and see how you keep us from not even being able to touch Demonic Beast fur.\u201d The young man sneered and said with extreme disdain.Lou Mu Yan gave the two a like in her heart2\u2014they sure knew exactly what to do! After completing the mission, the two days left would be filled with idleness and boredom. Since it didn't really occur often that an opportunity to prank would arrive at the door by itself, she'd play with them a bit then.\u201cAlright! You two just prepare to pack your bags and return to the Imperial Capital after two days then.\u201d Lou Mu Yan smiled devilishly and the arrogance in her eyes was undisguised.\u201cHumph, what big-talk. Just wait and see.\u201d Yun Ge also couldn't help but snort, turned around and dragged Ji Han Xu with the rest, leaving the icefield. She wanted to find Tier 5 Demonic Beasts before Lou Mu Yan and the others and let that woman lose face entirely.The people from the other small team glanced at each other and followed. They were all Sword Spirit strengths, so if they wanted to successfully complete the task, they had to rely on Ji Han Xu.Yun Zi Mo's obsidian-like eyes were encircled with a layer of unidentifiable light. He took a deep look at Lou Mu Yan, addressed Yun Lan, then turned to leave.However his route was the opposite of Yun Ge's group. He had a feeling that if he followed Yun Ge, his mission would be difficult to complete.After all the people who had intruded left, worry rose in Xiao Zi Ang's eyes, \u201cLou Mu Yan, even if you want to help me retaliate against them, you didn't need to boast so wildly right. If you let them kill a Tier 5 Demonic Beast, then we'd both lose our faces terribly.\u201dAlthough he said this, he didn't have any intent on blaming her. On the contrary, there was an unprecedented excitement in his heart, as if he was going to do something amazingly terribly bad with Lou Mu Yan.He didn't know why, but when it came to Lou Mu Yan's words, he actually felt a sense of unquestioning belief. He really was spending a bit too much time with this violent woman\u2026Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksLou Mu Yan looked at him askance as if he were an idiot, \u201cYou're the only one that'll lose face, it's got nothing to do with me.\u201d After a pause, she added, \u201cLet's go quickly. Don't always think about playing dirty tricks, you still have to kill seven Tier 5 Demonic Beasts to complete the mission.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Xiao Zi Ang's forehead was full of creases. Was it impossible to speak nicely now, it was obvious that she wanted to play dirty tricks to prank people, so what did it have to do with him. Not to mention, could she not always mention the seven Demonic Beast's situation and poke his sore spots.\u201cYou guys that have finished the mission, will you be going back first, or follow us to prank people?\u201d A naughty smile rose on Lou Mu Yan's lips.Lou Mu Yan made it no secret that she was not a virtuous maiden, and she definitely wasn't a good person. But such a straightforward temperament just so happened to be something the others appreciated.\u201cSince Mu Yan is so confident, we naturally have to go and join in on the fun.\u201d Yun Lan revealed a light smile, and he couldn't help but feel that his heart was dyed with a layer of joy as he looked at the woman in front of him with her bright eyes, lively and adorable.Yun Jin loved to watch the excitement, so he blinked at Lou Mu Yan playfully and said with a smile: \u201cThey can't touch Demonic Beast fur, but me, Zi Ang and Yi Xuan's mission Demonic Beasts should be fine right?\u201dHe and Xiao Zi Ang's strength was at the bottom of the group, so they still had to kill four Tier 5 Demonic Beasts to complete the mission. Chi Yi Xuan still had two more, while the others had all completed their missions.\u201cNaturally. At the same time as making trouble, it's also for you guys to quickly complete your missions.\u201d Lou Mu Yan rolled her eyes at Yun Jin. He could even ask such a stupid question. Sure enough, after spending a long time with Xiao Zi Ang, his IQ was also dragged down.\u201cLou Mu Yan, you're sure loyal. When we return to the Imperial Capital, your brother, I, will look after you.\u201d Xiao Zi Ang wanted to reach out to hang his arm around Lou Mu Yan's shoulder to express that they were good brothers, but was deliberately blocked by Chi Yi Xuan.\u201cLet's go too and find the Tier 5 Demonic Beasts before them.\u201d Chi Yi Xuan said deeply.He felt very uncomfortable right now. He was delightedly surprised that Lou Mu Yan once again shocked and amazed him, and kept attracting his gaze, making his heart beat uncontrollably. But at the same time, he also hoped to hide her deeply so that she couldn't be coveted by other men.The Tier 5 Demonic Beasts marked on Yun Lan's map had basically been cleaned up by them, and the few that were left were rather far away.Xiao Zi Ang couldn't help but ask again, while walking: \u201cHow do we find Tier 5 Demonic Beasts without a map? Follow Yun Ge and the others?\u201dThen he immediately knocked his head and laughed, saying: \u201cThat's right! We can follow them. The moment we encounter a Tier 5 Demonic Beast, we can just rush over and kill it first.\u201d\u201cDo you think Ji Han Xu's Sword King cultivation base is just a accessory?\u201d Lou Mu Yan looked at Xiao Zi Ang wordlessly, \u201cBesides, what we want to do is play tricks on them, so naturally they need to personally watch how we don't leave a single fur for them. Do you think it's possible to do that if we try to snatch and kill the Demonic Beast after following them?\u201d\u201cThen what should we do? You must have some idea, right?\u201d Xiao Zi Ang saw the brilliance in Lou Mu Yan's eyes and knew immediately that this woman was plotting again. Luckily he wasn't her enemy, otherwise he really would be played to death.Lou Mu Yan raised an eyebrow and smiled in a dominating manner: \u201cThat's only natural. Not only do I want them to be eliminated in the first mission, but I also want them to personally witness how we put all the mission items into our own pockets.\u201dSeeing her confident, gorgeous smile, all of them unanimously lit a candle3\u00a0in their hearts for those who offended Lou Mu Yan.1common colloquial saying meaning they teammate's not only useless but causes trouble for others.2more colloquial sayings, this time is basically like how we say we 'liked' a Facebook post or other social media posts. Pretty modern word, but you know, it's a webnovel.3lighting candles is usually done for the dead, or to pray and/or bless someone, but in this case lighting candles is used to 'pray' for them, hoping they don't 'die' too badly since Lou Mu Yan really is going to prank them hard.

Yet who knew that this woman would bother him for such trivial matters.Lou Mu Yan held Mo Yan in her arms and poked him on the back, telepathically saying: \u201cDo you still want that pill refined from a Tier 5 Crystal Core? If you don't work hard, you want to take it for nothing?\u201dThen she said twaddled on: \u201cDon't you know this is also because I want to help you collect more Crystal Cores to refine into pills? Since you don't cherish it, then go back to your Spirit Pet Bangle and continue to cultivate.\u201dMo Yan took a deep breath. This woman really was 'good', \u201cThere's a Tier 5 Snow Leopard five hundred metres ahead of that group of people.\u201dLou Mu Yan's eyes were full of smiles, and she continued poking at the soft and warm little beast in her arms, \u201cNow that's right, being tactful is the solid principle.\u201dMo Yan didn't bother to talk to her anymore. After pointing the way, he just let Lou Mu Yan hold him as he closed his eyes to rest.With Mo Yan's precise instructions, Lou Mu Yan took Yun Lan and the others around to a small path and circled in front of Yun Ge and the others.Sure enough, after five hundred metres, on a low mound, they found traces of a Tier 5 Snow Leopard.\u201cWhat're you three waiting for? First come first serve, don't you want to complete your mission?\u201d Lou Mu Yan leaned on a big tree, pointed to the Snow Leopard not far away and looked at the three that hadn't completed their missions indolently.She had hunted and killed ten Initial-Phase Tier 5 Demonic Beasts already, and also gradually found that feeling of doing something to her heart's content. So it wasn't that she didn't want to help the three of them kill the Demonic Beasts, but she hoped that they would grow up on their own.The Trial mission of slaying Tier 5 Demonic Beasts a level above them wasn't just a test for those who participated in the Trial, but it was also to hone their combat skills and survivability.The three of them were dazed for a moment when they heard Lou Mu Yan's words, then two figures quickly dashed out and went straight for the Snow Leopard. Xiao Zi Ang, who was a half-beat behind, cursed, then also charged over quickly.The three men besieged and scrambled for that one Snow Leopard. In the end, it was Yun Jin who played a trick that caused the other two to be half-step slower when they were about to kill the Snow Leopard, and successfully scooped out the Snow Leopard's Crystal Core. He held it in his hands and waved it at Lou Mu Yan and the rest, a face of smugness.And it was at this moment that Yun Ge and her team also found this low mound. But when they saw the Snow Leopard's Crystal Core in Yun Jin's hands, their complexion wasn't very good.\u201cLou Mu Yan, didn't you say that\u00a0you\u00a0wouldn't let us even touch the fur of a Tier 5 Demonic Beast? Why is the person who killed the Demonic Beast my Royal Elder Brother, weren't you quite capable before?\u201d Yun Ge saw that the person who slayed the Snow Leopard wasn't Lou Mu Yan, so her heart relaxed, and she couldn't help but ridicule.Lou Mu Yan sneered: \u201cDid I ever say that I'll do it myself? Why should I bother exerting my mental effort when someone could exert themselves instead, I'm not as stupid as you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Yun Ge trembled with anger. Lou Mu Yan that bitch actually dared say she was stupid, it was truly unforgivable.Except, she only got to say one word and was stopped by Ji Han Xu behind her, whose brows were furrowed. Lou Mu Yan did only say that she wouldn't even allow them to touch a Demonic Beast, but she didn't say that she would do it herself. What's the use of arguing about these things now? He became more and more angry with Yun Ge within.\u201cEnough. Now isn't the time to argue. Let's hurry up and find the next Tier 5 Demonic Beast.\u201dNo one in the two teams had completed their first Trial mission yet. If they followed this trend, they could really be eliminated. Ji Han Xu intensely regretted why he would team up with Yun Ge.The worries in Ji Han Xu's heart, Yun Ge naturally thought of too. She sure didn't want to be eliminated in the first round of the Trial mission, so she could only glare at Lou Mu Yan unwillingly and say ruthlessly, \u201cLou Mu Yan, just you wait.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cI await your esteemed self1\u00a0anytime.\u201d Lou Mu Yan chuckled nonchalantly.A character like Yun Ge couldn't even compare to Gu Yan Ran. She really didn't pay attention to her, and she didn't have time to play with her even more. If she wanted to cause trouble, then she'll just accompany her whenever necessary.The young man also glared at Lou Mu Yan, \u201cTrash, just you want and see.\u201dHearing the word 'trash', Lou Mu Yan's pretty eyes narrowed.In the following two days, a similar scenario was acted out in the boundary of the outer ring and inner ring in the Glacial Mountain Range time and again.Just when the Trial students of the two team's found a trail of their target Tier 5 Demonic Beast, Lou Mu Yan and her group would always be ahead of them one step, not more nor less, and every time the groups arrived, the Demonic Beast would always just happen to be slayed. Indeed not a single fur was left for them.\u201cLou Mu Yan, have you played enough games?\u201d Ji Han Xu changed from his usual cheerful laughter to an expression that carried slight grimness as he looked at the dead Demonic Beasts on the ground.Lou Mu Yan wrapped her fingers around a strand of shiny black hair, raised an eyebrow and said: \u201cDidn't your people let me do this? Of course it's not enough.\u201d\u201cLou Mu Yan, those two offended you, but we haven't. Isn't it too much of you to keep robbing our target Demonic Beasts.\u201d The leader of the other group of students from the Empire Academy couldn't help but step forward and say.Lou Mu Yan tilted her head to look at Xiao Zi Ang and asked: \u201cDid I kill that Demonic Beast?\u201d\u201cNo, Yun Jin killed it.\u201d Xiao Zi Ang shook his head cooperatively.Lou Mu Yan shrugged to the group of people not far away and said, \u201cDid you hear that, the one who snatched your target Demonic Beast was Yun Jin, so what's it got to do with me?\u201dBoth teams were all rather angered by that careless, unscrupulous tone.It was true that she wasn't the one who killed the Demonic Beasts. But making the connection with the powdered drugs from before that could make Demonic Beasts unable to move temporarily, prepared by Lou Mu Yan, they all concluded that it was definitely Lou Mu Yan's 'masterpiece' for them to always, 'coincidentally', be that\u00a0one step\u00a0ahead in finding a Tier 5 Demonic Beast.Yun Jin's eyelids couldn't help but twitch, and he didn't know whether to cry or laugh. Just who was the one who ordered him to go fight before?\u201cLou Mu Yan, do you really want everyone in our two teams to be eliminated?\u201d Ji Han Xu suppressed the anger in his chest and calmly asked as he looked at Lou Mu Yan.Lou Mu Yan swept across Ji Han Xu with a look as if saying he was stupid, then said slowly: \u201cI've got no grievances against you guys, why do I want to eliminate everyone in your two teams? I'm betting with them, not you guys. Isn't it fine if you just don't follow them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d After hearing her say that, the rest also had a revelation, and they secretly blamed Yun Ge and the young boy. The two thought they were so amazing and wanted to gamble with Lou Mu Yan before, but now they were all being held back because of the two.Lou Mu Yan caught the looks on the people opposite, then reminded them kindly with a smile: \u201cThere's only one day remaining in the Trial. You all better hurry up.\u201dNeither of the two teams could do anything to her, and they couldn't delay anymore time even more. In order to complete the Trial mission, they all regrouped, then quickly went to other places to look for Tier 5 Demonic Beasts.Ji Han Xu also left Yun Ge who was pestering him, quickly leaving with the other two members of the Imperial Family. They didn't have a lot remaining to complete the mission, so there was still hope to complete it in a day.According to Mo Yan's prompt, there weren't many Tier 5 Demonic Beasts within the few thousand li nearby, and those that were left were all at Advanced-Phase or Peak-Phase Tier 5 strength. These people would still have a fierce battle left to fight. With Yun Ge and the young man's strength, the possibility of hunting down Tier 5 Demonic Beasts individually was practically zero.Lou Mu Yan also lost the interest to continue playing with Yun Ge and the boy. Xiao Zi Ang and the other two had also completed their missions, so there was no need for them to continue into the inner ring's border anymore.1the best translation I could give for the words '\u5927\u9a7e' (da jia) as of now. It literally translates to 'large carriage' and figuratively is used to refer to someone powerful in status, or simply to be polite by referring to them as '\u5927\u9a7e' and is often used as \u5927\u9a7e\u5149\u4e34, meaning 'we are honoured by your presence'. It can also be used figuratively to refer to the Emperor, amongst many other words. In this case, Lou Mu Yan's saying 'great self' sarcastically.Note: I've been changing some terminology recently. Nothing big, but I did change 'Imperial Academy' to 'Empire Academy' recently. I can't remember if I changed anything else, and I don't remember if I mentioned everything I changed. But these terminology changes are on purpose haha. To make it consistent, I also go back to the previous chapters and change it all (unless I missed some accidentally), so it's possible some terminology might be different to what you remember\u2014it's not the author changing it, it's me changing the translation to better suit the Chinese terms. Idk, I'm bored like that, and maybe it's the tiny perfectionist in me hahaha. If it is the author changing something or there's typos, if it's major, I might note it, if it's not that major, I might just translate it and not feel like making a note.

Not even a cup of tea's worth of time later, only Yun Ge and that young boy were left.Lou Mu Yan snapped her fingers and addressed Yun Jin and the others, \u201cLet's return and hand in the mission.\u201dXiao Zi Ang's eyes swept across the two people whose expressions were exceptionally ugly and asked: \u201cMu Yan, we're not going to compete with them anymore?\u201dLou Mu Yan glanced at him faintly, \u201cDo you think they can deal with a Tier 5 Demonic Beast with their strength?\u201dXiao Zi Ang looked at the two again. They were both Sword Spirit strength, so he shook his head: \u201cNaturally it's impossible for the two to deal with Tier 5 Demonic Beasts.\u201dHe was an Advanced-Phase Sword Spirit, but when he was slaying the ten Tier 5 Demonic Beasts earlier for the mission, he used items like pills, Spirit Treasures, Talismans and the like that he had on him. From time to time, he even had to rely on Lou Mu Yan and the others to barely be able to complete the mission. As for the two opposite, if they were to rely on their own strength, they definitely wouldn't be able to complete the mission.\u201cExactly,\u00a0so why waste time with them here.\u201d Lou Mu Yan walked towards a small path with Mo Yan in her arms, then made a hand gesture to the others: \u201cLet's go and hand in the mission.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Yun Lan and the others also ignored the existence of Yun Ge and the boy and left together.With tears of grievance and resentment in Yun Ge's eyes, she took a deep breath and said to the young man beside her: \u201cWe're just going to let them go like this?\u201d\u201cOtherwise what do we do? The two of us aren't their opponents at all.\u201d The young boy had always been the master of deceiving good and fearing evil. Even if he secretly despised in his heart right now, he didn't dare cause trouble for Lou Mu Yan in front of her. After he returned to the Imperial Capital, he had many ways to find the ground he lost today.Yun Ge stomped her foot and glared at Lou Mu Yan's back that had long disappeared, then turned around and headed in the direction Ji Han Xu went.She was also considered an expert when she was training in the Empire Academy's Secret Grounds, but only after entering the Glacial Mountain Range, did she realise she was, in actual fact, the very bottom of existence, and could only rely on Ji Han Xu. So if she didn't want to be eliminated, she could only go find Ji Han Xu.The young man gritted his teeth and followed in Yun Ge's footsteps to find Ji Han Xu and the others together, but in his heart he had the decision to give up the Trial. With his strength, it would be as hard as climbing the Heavens if he wanted to seize one of the six places of the Trial.Lou Mu Yan took the few people around waves after waves of Demonic Beasts,\u00a0and it took only half a day to return to the wooden hut for the Trial Mission.\u201cMu Yan, your Fire Cloud Mink sure is really powerful. Not only can it find Spiritual Stones and Spiritual Herbs, it can also help avoid Demonic Beasts at least hundreds of metres away. It was really worth that much ink-gold coins back then.\u201dYun Jin couldn't help but sigh with mixed emotions the moment he entered the wooden hut. Lou Mu Yan's eyes were truly sharp. She could even see the potential in such a Spirit Pet\u2014she was truly abnormal.A smile rose on Lou Mu Yan's lips and she stretched out her hand to smooth Mo Yan's fur who was in her arms, \u201cThat's only natural, how can\u00a0my\u00a0Spirit Pet be lacking?\u201dXiao Zi Ang rolled his eyes, \u201cLou Mu Yan,\u00a0I've discovered that you really don't have any of the reservations that girls have.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201d Lou Mu Yan raised an eyebrow. Why must she have the reservedness that girls should have, \u201cEven if I have a reserved side, I shouldn't show it to you.\u201d\u201cThen who'll you show it to?\u201d Xiao Xi Ang smiled like a curious little baby at Lou Mu Yan as he glanced at Chi Yi Xuan in his peripheral vision and found that he had stiffened.Upon hearing Xiao Zi Ang's question, Yun Lan and the others also curiously awaited Lou Mu Yan's answer.Lou Mu Yan took out a pot of Spiritual Tea and began to brew it. Her hand movements were elegant and methodical, and only after a while did she say slowly: \u201cOf course I'll show it to my future husband.\u201d\u201cPfft, Lou Mu Yan, you really have no shame. Just look at how old you are and you're already thinking about your future husband.\u201d Xiao Zi Ang laughed aloud.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksLou Mu Yan's beautiful eyes lightly narrowed at Xiao Zi Ang, causing him to shudder. He immediately shut his mouth. When this woman plotted against someone, it came in sets. It was best that he didn't offend her.\u201cThen what kind of husband does Mu Yan want to find in the future?\u201d Yun Jin approached Lou Mu Yan and asked with a smile.Lou Mu Yan was dazed for a moment. She seemed to have never thought about what sort of man she wanted as a husband in the future. In her past life, she was pursued by numerous men, as if schools of crucian carps in a river1, but there was no appearance of a man that could make her heart beat.She unconsciously rubbed the ice bangle on her wrist and a red figure surfaced in her mind. Then she chuckled and shook her head. Why did she think of that devilish man.Her originally confused eyes instantly regained their clarity, and she said with a light smile: \u201cWho knows about things in the future. Let's talk about it when I meet someone who can make my heart beat for him.\u201dHer words were also equivalent to rejecting all the men present here. Although unintentional, but it had made the few, aside from Xiao Zi Ang and Lou Mu Bai, who were originally in high spirits, downcast.Lou Mu Yan had actually faintly noticed that Yun Lan and Yun Jin were both slightly interested in her, but she didn't feel any attraction to them, so it was impossible to accept them. As for Chi Yi Xuan, it was even more impossible.For a while, the atmosphere in the wooden hut was a little gloomy. Lou Mu Bai drunk his tea as he stroked the blue and white porcelain teacup, the corners of his mouth curled up.His younger sister was just too outstanding. He didn't want to let her marry out so early either. Though he wondered just who could be worthy enough for his younger sister who was like a pearl\u2014like a jewel\u2014in the future.Around an hour later, Yun Cang walked in from outside the wooden hut. Seeing these people sitting inside, he wasn't surprised either. After examining their respective Demonic Beast corpses, he assigned the second Trial mission to them.\u201cWonderful, congratulations for successfully completing your first Trial mission.\u201d Yun Cang's wrinkled old face revealed a rare smile. \u201cYou don't need to wait for the others. You guys can just start the second Trial mission.\u201dThen he distributed a list for everyone, filled with many words. After the several people read through the list, he said: \u201cThis is the mission list for each one of you. You must find at least two-thirds of the items to pass and advance to the next part of the Trial. Less than two-thirds, then you'll be eliminated and sent back to the Imperial Capital.\u201dXiao Zi Ang stretched out his head and studied Yun Lan and Lou Mu Yan's lists, and found that they were all different. He raised his head and asked Yun Cang: \u201cImperial Teacher, why do we all have different mission lists to complete?\u201d\u201cHa, of course your missions lists are all different. Although I said that you can still team up for the second Trial mission, but I didn't say that your missions would be the same.\u201dYun Cang swept over them with a look of fun in his eyes, then said: \u201cOriginally, the duration of this mission is still five days, but you all have completed the first Trial mission a day in advance, so I'll give you an extra day's time. Six days later, return here to hand in your mission.\u201cLet me remind you that if you form a team to look for items on this list one by one, then at most you could only complete the missions of two people. So this mission tests your individual survivability and adaptive skills.\u201d\u201cThen doesn't that mean we can't form a team anymore?\u201d Yun Jin furrowed his brows, \u201cThere's so many mission items on this list, and there's no marked map, so how do we find them?\u201d\u201cWhether you want to form a team or not is up to you, but it's only efficient if you complete this mission individually. So think about it yourself.\u201dYun Cang smiled profoundly. \u201cAs for how you'll search for the items on the paper, it all depends on your respective abilities, otherwise do you think it's that easy to obtain one of the six places?\u201cAlright, after you prepare, you can start your mission.\u201d As soon as Yun Cang finished speaking, in a flash, he disappeared from the wooden hut.Lou Mu Yan held the mission list in her hands, and there was a smile brimming in the bottom of her eyes. The opportunity to individually go search for the Deep Orchid had come.At the same time, a man who wore a silver mask and flamboyant red clothes also took two people into the boundary between the outer ring and inner ring of the Glacial Mountain Range.1pretty straight forward\u2014a\u00a0lot\u00a0of men pursued Lou Mu Yan. An idiom that comes from a historical event.Note: Yay~ MX x LMY fans (including myself) will probably love the following few chapters. Just don't complain about their relationship developing too fast because I'm here all for that development. XDPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter Yun Cang left, the several people looked at the mission list in their hands again, then exchanged glances.\u201cLooks like we have to complete the missions separately.\u201d Lou Mu Bai placed his teacup down and put away the list.Yun Lan and the rest could only nod in agreement. It would be impossible to find so many items on the list without completing the missions separately.\u201cThen I'll leave first. You guys be careful.\u201d Yun Luo stood up and said before leaving the wooden hut.Chi Yi Xuan glanced at Lou Mu Yan deeply, and the hand that held the list tightened. Then he also stood up and said: \u201cI'm leaving too. Mu Yan and you all, be careful!\u201d\u201cLet's go. See you all in six days. Everyone take care!\u201d Lou Mu Yan finished the tea in her cup, then stood up and said to the several people with a smile.Although Lou Mu Bai felt uneasy about his younger sister, but he also hoped that she could grow up independently. His eyes carried some encouragement, \u201cYan'er, be careful on your way. If you encounter anyone or a Demonic Beast that you can't beat, then run. Your life is the most important.\u201d\u201cYep, Elder Brother too.\u201d Lou Mu Yan carried warmth in her eyes.\u201cMu Yan, be careful. Here's a signal flare of the Imperial Family. If something happens, you can release this signal and we'll come as soon as possible.\u201d Yun Lan took out a small, black wooden box from his interspatial ring and handed it to Lou Mu Yan.Lou Mu Yan took the wooden box and nodded with a smile: \u201cElder Cousin Brother, you guys also need to be careful.\u201d\u201cIt's really boring to do missions alone.\u201d Xiao Xi Ang said listlessly.Yun Jin patted him on the shoulder and said: \u201cBrother, you take good care of yourself. Make sure not to be eliminated.\u201d\u201cYou too. Alright, we're talking as if we'll be separated for a long time. I'm leaving too.\u201d Xiao Zi Ang sighed with a bit of reluctance in his eyes.\u00a0But this was what they must experience. And he was afraid that if he continued to delay this, he wouldn't want to go out to complete the mission alone anymore, so he quickly walked out of the wooden hut.\u201cLet's go too.\u201d Lou Mu Yan was also a bit affected by everyone's emotions.\u201cAlright!\u201dTwo hours later, Lou Mu Yan entered a hillside blooming with fresh flowers. She walked over, looked around the densely packed flowers of various colours, then finally uprooted a small pink-yellow flower among them and put it away.\u201cFinished one mission item, still nineteen more to look for.\u201d Lou Mu Yan left the hillside and said to Mo Yan in her arms.Mo Yan's indifferent eyes were as calm as water, \u201cYou can find it all in a day.\u201dLou Mu Yan's eyes curved as she reached out her hand and rubbed Mo Yan's furry head, then said with a smile: \u201cYour talent for finding Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Items really is Heaven-defying. After we finish finding the twenty mission items, I'll first find a place to help you refine the pill.\u201dMo Yan's brows were knitted tightly together as he looked up at Lou Mu Yan unhappily and said: \u201cDon't rub my head.\u201dHe, a King that reigned over a portion of the Demonic World was actually being rubbed on the head by a human woman. If other Demonic Clans knew, wouldn't he be laughed to death.\u201cRubbing your head shows intimacy. Since we're life-and-death partners, it's just rubbing your head, what does it matter? Mo Yan, sometimes you're really quarrelsome.\u201d Lou Mu Yan pursed her lips. She definitely wouldn't admit that it was because Mo Yan's furry head felt too good that she couldn't help but want to touch it.Mo Yan took a deep breath. Lou Mu Yan really evoked a lot of emotions that he hadn't felt for many years. He told himself inwardly not to argue with this woman.In the Glacial Mountain Range, there was a white silhouette that whizzed and darted about, with speed comparable to even a Tier 4 flying-type Demonic Beast.After Lou Mu Yan advanced to Sword Spirit Master, the Silk-Mist Steps that's a part of her Flash Step Manual had become a slight burden. So she utilised a faster footwork within the Flash Step, drifting towards the position indicated by Mo Yan.\u201cIt seems that I should contract a flying-type Demonic Beast\u00a0as a mount. Using Flash Step nonstop really wastes a lot of Spiritual Energy.\u201d After putting the fifteenth mission item into her interspatial ring, Lou Mu Yan muttered to herself.Mo Yan wasn't too shocked by Lou Mu Yan's ghostly skills anymore. Instead, he felt that no matter what amazing things this woman did, it was all normal.He also agreed with her thoughts, \u201cYour skills that can move and change steps is more suitable for combat. Using it for travel wastes too much energy and the speed's much slower than that of a Demonic Beast. Contracting a flying-type Demonic Beast sounds good.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cThen you pay attention. If there's a Demonic Beast that's not that bad, we'll up and get it.\u201d Lou Mu Yan couldn't help but rub Mo Yan's furry head again.Mo Yan lowered his eyes to hide the helplessness in them\u2014forget it, he'll just let this woman do as she liked.\u201cAlright. Keep going, the Ice Serpent Fruit should be in that mountain.\u201d Mo Yan probed the area using his innate talent calmly, then said as he looked towards the ice mountain in the far east.Lou Mu Yan took out a bottle of Elemental Energy Replenishing Pills. She didn't rest and utilised her Flash Step straight towards the ice mountain.Half a day passed, and Lou Mu Yan clutched a green fruit as she ran, in a rather sorry state. The roar of Demonic Beasts echoed from behind incessantly.Only after the Demonic Beast auras behind her gradually distanced and disappeared did she leap onto a big tree to recover her strength, gasping.After taking an Elemental Energy Replenishing Pill, she put the green fruit into her interspatial ring and said to Mo Yan with lingering fear: \u201cJust now it was all thanks to your pressure as a Royal Species that stopped them for a few breaths, otherwise it would've been dangerous today.\u201dThey also encountered a lot of Demonic Beasts guarding when searching for the mission items, but she easily obtained them.Except, when they were looking for the last mission item, they attracted four Tier 5 Demonic Beasts to attack, and one of them was even a late-stage Tier 5 Mammoth. She used a lot of methods, plus Mo Yan releasing his innate talent once, to be able to shake off those Demonic Beasts.\u201cI believe that even if we couldn't shake them off, you'd still be able to take care of them.\u201d Mo Yan stood on Lou Mu Yan's shoulder and spoke calmly.Lou Mu Yan rolled her eyes at him, \u201cI can take care of them, but maybe I'd have to use my trump cards.\u201d\u201cI sure do want to see just what trump cards you have left.\u201d Mo Yan just saw Lou Mu Yan use another skill he hadn't seen before, and his curiosity grew even deeper.Lou Mu Yan raised an eyebrow: \u201cYou want to know? I won't tell you.\u201dMo Yan's dark eyes deepened. He was already accustomed to the little temper that this woman occasionally exposed. He didn't answer, closed his eyes, and began to rest.Lou Mu Yan's lips curved up and didn't say anymore either. After setting up an Array to hide her aura, she took a pill to recover.Four hours later, she opened her eyes and poked the little white beast lying in front of her, \u201cI've recovered, Mo Yan, let's go find a place to refine pills.\u201d\u201cLet's go find the Deep Orchid you want first. You can refine pills anytime.\u201d Mo Yan opened his eyes and said lightly.Lou Mu Yan thought a bit, then nodded: \u201cThat's fine too! Have you detected the Deep Orchid's aura?\u201d\u201cNot the Deep Orchid's aura, but I did find the Demonic Beast, the Scarlet-Frost Jiao1\u00a0that's guarding it. It's a two hour's journey to the west. Let's go.\u201d After Mo Yan finished speaking, he leapt onto Lou Mu Yan's shoulder and closed his eyes to rest again.Lou Mu Yan's eyes were filled with joy. Was she finally going to find it?Two hours later, Lou Mu Yan stood near a deep lake wound in green mist with furrowed brows as she observed her surroundings.\u201cSomeone's coming.\u201d Mo Yan's voice suddenly resounded in her Sea of Consciousness.At the same time, a Mental Energy locked onto her location.The other party had already discovered them, and it was too late to escape. Alertness flashed across the bottom of Lou Mu Yan's eyes, and she turned to look towards the woods not far away.Not long afterwards, she saw three people walk out of the woods. The leader amongst them was tall, wore a silver mask, and his red clothes billowed in the wind, flamboyant and uninhibited.Ming Xiu's eyes were dyed with a layer of a smile, and he looked at the gorgeous, stunning, white-clothed woman opposite him as his thin lips opened: \u201cWoman, we meet again.\u201d1for some reason the author really likes the word \u8d64 (red/crimson) LOL. She named the Jiao, the Cold-Mist Jiao (\u5bd2\u96fe\u86df) in chapter 85 and now she's naming this Jiao the 'Scarlet-Cold Jiao' (\u8d64\u5bd2\u86df). Which reminds me of what I translated before, 'Chi'huo Continent' (\u8d64\u706b\u5927\u9646) uses the same 'chi' (\u8d64). I thought the one in this chapter and Chi'huo Continent are both typos but for once I'm translating ahead and she keeps using Scarlet-Frost Jiao. Which makes me remember that she has changed the names of previous Demonic Beasts too and she stuck with the changed name instead of the original, so most likely this Jiao is stuck with 'Scarlet-Frost Jiao' now. As for Chi'huo Continent, that's most likely a typo. I'll fix it up when I have to eventually. Now, why do I get the feeling it's the name of a continent in one of her other series\u2026 or a kingdom in one of her other series\u2026 Can't remember now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Master had never been so friendly to anyone before. Meanwhile the eyes of the other enchanting woman were cold and unkind.\u201cTake a guess!\u201d Ming Xiu leaned closer to Lou Mu Yan and his warm breath hit her ears.Lou Mu Yan's eyes darkened and didn't avoid him as she stared directly at the flamboyant and domineering man, \u201cFor the Scarlet-Frost Jiao, or for the Deep Orchid?\u201dA devilish smile rose on Ming Xiu's lips, and their breaths intertwined. His long and thin eyes narrowed slightly, \u201cWhat if This Highness wants both?\u201dThis woman actually came to this place, then it must be for the Deep Orchid.Lou Mu Yan stretched her hand out and poked Ming Xiu's sturdy chest, pushing him a step away, then said calmly: \u201cI want the Deep Orchid.\u201d\u201cPfft! An Initial-Phase Sword Spirit cultivation base Sword Master also wants the Deep Orchid? What a joke.\u201d The enchanting woman behind sneered, her tone carrying thick contempt.It was because she relied on her status as Ming Xiu's Right Guardian, that she could ridicule this beautiful girl that she found extremely unpleasing to the eye.Her Master had never liked being close to others and kept at least three feet away from anyone, yet who knew that he would be so intimate with a little girl that suddenly appeared from nowhere. A sense of crisis rushed up to Mo Lan's heart.Lou Mu Yan's gaze shifted to the enchanting and bewitching woman, but didn't directly reply, then immediately retrieved her gaze, raised an eyebrow, and looked at Ming Xiu, saying: \u201cYour dog's barking.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Mo Lan's enchanting face suddenly changed. The pressure of a Sword Monarch was fully exerted, and she pressed it towards Lou Mu Yan.Lou Mu Yan's eyes chilled. Was it that now everyone wanted to squish her like a soft peach1? Just when she was about to mobilise a Mental Energy tempest within her Sea of Consciousness, she saw the man before her gently wave his sleeve, and that pressure instantly disappeared.He didn't even look at the woman behind him as he uttered some cold words: \u201cMo Lan, go to the Criminal Law Hall yourself for three months.\u201d\u201cMaster.\u201d Mo Lan's eyes were full of disbelief. She bit her lip and addressed aggrievedly.\u201cOne year. Go yourself.\u201d Ming Xiu turned and looked at Mo Lan with a cold expression.The grievances in Mo Lan's heart expanded infinitely. Master had never punished her to go to the Criminal Law Hall, and yet this time, he actually punished her because of that little bitch. Just when she wanted to speak, she was stopped by the middle-aged man beside her.\u201cYou know Master's temper. If you say anymore, you won't just be going for a year.\u201d The man whispered to Mo Lan.There was reluctance in Mo Lan's eyes. She raised her head and looked at Ming Xiu, but her heart trembled from the dissatisfaction in that pair of cold eyes. It seemed that Master was really angry.Master's temperament was really impermanent, sometimes devilish, sometimes cold, sometimes gentle. She didn't know which was the real him at all, but once he was angry, whoever dared to disobey, they definitely wouldn't end well.\u201cMo Lan obeys.\u201d Mo Lan retrained the insidiousness in her eyes, lowered her head and replied respectfully.Ever since she started following Master, she had adored him. She only wished that one day2, he would have her in his heart, and even take her as his wife. So she couldn't tolerate any woman getting close to Ming Xiu. She remembered that woman in her heart, and one day, she would definitely make her die without a grave.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cGo.\u201d Ming Xiu furrowed his brows and the devilish smile had long disappeared, replaced by a cold look.Mo Lan pinched her palm tightly. She didn't want to leave. She raised her head and looked at Ming Xiu, her eyes watery and aggrieved, saying: \u201cMaster, after the matters at the Glacial Mountain Range is finished, Mo Lan will go back to be punished.\u201d\u201cNo need. Go now.\u201d Currently, Ming Xiu truly despised the deep adoration in Mo Lan's eyes to the extremes. There was no need for a Guardian who didn't know her own place to continue to be by his side.\u201cBut\u2014 PU!\u201d Mo Lan wanted to argue again, but with a casual swing of Ming Xiu's arm, she was struck back by a powerful Elemental Energy wave, and a mouthful of blood spurted out.\u201cGet lost!\u201d Ming Xiu's patience had almost been exhausted.He could already be considered indulging Mo Lan, but he didn't allow her to have any inordinate ambitions. Especially that insidious gaze cast towards Lou Mu Yan\u2014it made killing intent rise within him.\u201cMo Lan obeys!\u201d Mo Lan clutched her chest in terror, then said, unreconciled, and left.After turning around, her enchanting face became distorted, but she didn't bear grudges against Ming Xiu. Instead, she placed this debt all on Lou Mu Yan. When she came out of the Criminal Law Hall, she would make sure that this woman would feel better off dead.Lou Mu Yan's Mental Energy was very powerful, so she naturally found the hostility and killing aura Mo Lan had towards her, but she merely sneered in her heart.She raised her head and glared at Ming Xiu\u2014it was all this guy's fault for attracting rotten peach blossom3\u00a0debt, yet what did it have to do with her? Although she wasn't afraid of that Mo Lan, but she really was being innocently involved in all this.\u201cYou sure could bear hurting her.\u201d Lou Mu Yan was upset, and her eyes carried a meaningful, profound look of ridicule.Ming Xiu's phoenix eyes grew deep, and an unprecedented anger rose in his chest. He hated this little woman looking at him with eyes that carried ridicule.He stretched out his hand and gently squeezed Lou Mu Yan's chin, brought his head closer until the tips of their nose almost touched and said coldly: \u201cWoman, you're not allowed to use that look to look at This Highness.\u201d\u201cWhy not? Who are you to me? Why do I have to listen to you?\u201d Lou Mu Yan sneered. No one had ever dared to squeeze her chin.\u201cWho?\u201d Ming Xiu pondered for a while, released the hand that squeezed her chin, then suddenly placed his lips on Lou Mu Yan's lips, but only a touch, before immediately leaving, with eyes that carried dark, non-dissolvable ink4. He spoke with an arrogant, domineering manner, his voice deep and sexy: \u201cHow about being your man?\u201dHe had always hated physical contact with people, and hated the rouge smell on women even more, but he didn't expect that when he approached this woman, there would actually be an urge to have a taste of her flavour. The result was, he found that the taste of a woman's soft, glutinous, warm lips was actually pretty good.\u201cBe my man?\u201d Lou Mu Yan's bright eyes were currently filled with obscure colours. She was actually kissed by this man. For the first time in her two lives was she treated like this by a man.As the Spiritual World's Female Immortal, how could she allow herself to be so easily flirted with by a man. After a pause, she suddenly stretched out her hand and wrapped her arms around Ming Xiu's neck. Her red lips kissed his, but it also didn't linger long. When they parted, her lips revealed slight playfulness, and she said: \u201cIt seems Monarch Ming's flavour isn't that good.\u201dAfter speaking, she turned and walked forward, but ripples rose in her originally calm heart.The gaze beneath Ming Xiu's mask deepened, and the sexy, thin lips rose into an exceedingly devilish arc. This woman sure was courageous, but she damnably matched his appetite.1the original saying is 'soft persimmon' so when someone 'squeezes a soft persimmon' it means they take them as weak and easy to bully. Here it seems the author wants to be creative and say soft peach?2well, so I'm pretty sure, for some weird reason, they censored the word \u5929 or \u65e5 which means 'day', again. It happened last time in chapter who-knows-what, and it's happened again because I am certain that word fits in this context since it's something that everyone says 'one day' this, 'one day' that etc. Why so specific? Haha3'peach blossom' is often used to in many instances to describe love interests or love-related things. For example, to 'have peach blossom luck' (\u8d70\u6843\u82b1\u8fd0) means that the person is lucky in love. In this case, to attract 'rotten peach blossoms' (\u70c2\u6843\u82b1) it means to have attracted unwanted love.4just looking at someone really, really, really deeply.Note: I warned you guys the development was rather fast! But oh my, I actually forgot that kiss happened HAHA. And oh my my, I forgot Lou Mu Yan 'returned the favour' to him too HAHA. XD More, more, more to come~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She walked to the edge of the wounding green mist and scrutinised it.\u201cThis is the poisonous mist released by that Frost Jiao. It'll dissipate automatically after an hour.\u201d Ming Xiu stepped forward and stood shoulder to shoulder with Lou Mu Yan.Mo Yan on Lou Mu Yan's shoulder, with an enigmatic expression, looked at the devilishly captivating man in red who approached them. This man was very strong. This was the first thing he sensed about Ming Xiu.\u201cYou want the Scarlet-Frost Jiao's Crystal Core?\u201d Lou Mu Yan lowered her eyes, then said leisurely after a while.Both of them spoke nothing of what occurred just now, and each had their own plans.Ming Xiu replied indifferently: \u201cNaturally.\u201d\u201cMing Xiu, let's make a deal.\u201d Lou Mu Yan looked at Ming Xiu seriously.She had just learnt from Mo Han that the Scarlet-Frost Jiao hidden deep in the bottom of the lake had concealed its cultivation base using a Secret Skill. It was actually a Tier 6 Demonic Beast and could be even more powerful.Now, even if she joined forces with Mo Yan, she would still be unable to fight a Tier 6 Demonic Beast that was at the level of a Sword Monarch. At the very least, she wouldn't be able to slay it, let alone obtain the Deep Orchid, that's why she wanted to cooperate with Ming Xiu.Ming Xiu's eyes revealed slight interest and asked with a faint smile: \u201cWhat sort of trade?\u201d There was a faint guess in his heart.\u201cYour cultivation base already broke through to Sword Sovereign. The Spirit Cleansing Pill that I gave you last time has little effect on you now. Let's work together. You kill the Scarlet-Frost Jiao, I'll use its Crystal Core to refine a pill for you, and I can guarantee that it's effect will be more than three times better than you refining the Crystal Core alone.\u201d Lou Mu Yan said with calm and composure.\u201cYou want the Deep Orchid to refine a pill?\u201d Ming Xiu asked Lou Mu Yan instead of answering immediately.Lou Mu Yan didn't hide it and nodded: \u201cThe Deep Orchid is very important to me. To be more precise, it's the pill that's made with the Deep Orchid as one of its main ingredients that's very important to me.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of pill?\u201d Ming Xiu was a little curious about which Grade this woman's Alchemy skills were at.\u201cFoundation Establishment Pill. You wouldn't know even if I said it.\u201d Lou Mu Yan paused, then continued: \u201cBut if you can help me obtain the Deep Orchid, I can give you one. It's effect is similar to the Marrow Cleansing Pill, but it's a more advanced pill. It's effective even for people with Sword Monarch strength and above.\u201d\u201cThe effect is similar to that of the Marrow Cleansing Pill? There's an even more Heaven-defying pill?\u201d Even if Ming Xiu had extensive experience, he had never heard of the Foundation Establishment Pill before, but he believed this little woman's words.The Foundation Establishment Pill was actually a pill used by Immortal Cultivators1\u00a0to advance to the Foundation Establishment Stage. It could wash the marrow, cleanse the body, and expand the meridians. The most important effect was that it helped a Cultivator to establish their foundation. Of course, not every Cultivator who took the Foundation Establishment Pill was able to successfully establish their foundation. With any pill, they only played a support role.The Meditation Stage and the Foundation Establishment Stage were definitely both watersheds for Cultivators. But almost none of the Sword Masters on Tian'ling Continent had Spiritual Roots. So they couldn't establish foundations and could only use it to wash their marrow and expel all the impurities that were once hidden in their bodies.\u201cThe Foundation Establishment Pill does indeed have this effect. You're now at the strength of a Sword Sovereign. Although it won't help you expand your meridians by many-fold, but it can at least still be able to cleanse all the meridians in your body, and flush out all the negative energy impurities.\u201dLou Mu Yan looked at Ming Xiu with a deep gaze, \u201cIn fact, you're the one that's at the advantage in this trade. Just say yes or no.\u201d\u201cYou've already said all that, so does This Highness still have any reason to reject?\u201d Ming Xiu let out a low laugh.This kind of pill moved even his heart as he listened. He sure didn't know what other skills this woman had. She was like a book\u2014with every page he opened, it would pleasantly surprise him. He really was looking forward to flipping through this book page by page.Meanwhile, the middle-aged man who stood behind the two of them had completely frozen, and his expression was as if he had seen a ghost. Just what did he see just now? Master, who had always been avoidant of females as if he were afraid he couldn't evade them, actually leaned down to kiss that young girl.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThen hearing the conversation that the two didn't avoid speaking in front him, the shock in his heart couldn't be calmed for a long time. That woman was actually the Alchemist that refined the Marrow Cleansing Pill that was currently being spoken of everywhere, and she could even refine a pill that Sword Monarch strength people could use to remove impurities. This was simply too unbelievable.And looking at Master's reaction, it was obvious that he knew about it. No wonder he would look at this young girl differently. It appeared that this woman was very special, hence why it attracted their Master's attention. Otherwise with Master's temperament, he wouldn't approach others on purpose simply to win them over.He sighed. It seemed that this time, Mo Lan was over. If Master's heart truly moved for this woman, then he naturally wouldn't allow anyone to harm her. In the future, he better be more respectful to this woman. Maybe she would be their Mistress2\u00a0in the future.\u201cOf course there's no reason to refuse.\u201d Lou Mu Yan smiled, her eyes curving, \u201cThen are we going to wait for the wounding green mist to disperse before entering?\u201dShe found that hidden in this layer of green mist was extreme venom, and even if a Sword Monarch level expert inhaled it, they would be poisoned.\u201cNo need. This Highness naturally has a way.\u201d Ming Xiu unintentionally exuded a domineering attitude as if looking down upon the world. His inborn noble temperament always inadvertently made one feel respect in fear.As soon as his voice fell, Ming Xiu took out a black gem that emitted a fluorescent light. After channelling some Elemental Energy, the black gem instantly shone brightly, and a black circle of light enveloped him and Lou Mu Yan.\u201cMo Gui, you stand guard outside and don't allow anyone in.\u201d Ming Xiu said lukewarmly.\u201cYes, Master!\u201d The middle-aged man replied respectfully.Ming Xiu naturally took Lou Mu Yan's hand and stepped into the wounding green mist. Mo Yan stared at the intertwined hands with an obscure expression.Lou Mu Yan felt her left hand being wrapped in a big, warm hand, and she fell into a slight daze. She lowered her eyes and looked at the hand held by Ming Xiu, but in the end, she didn't shake it off, and let him pull her forward.Ming Xiu's lips rose into a slight arc and there was a slight smile in his cold, phoenix eyes.As soon as the layers of green mist touched the black circle of light, it would automatically scatter as if it had met its nemesis, and the toxins contained in the mist couldn't penetrate the black light circle either.\u201cThat Scarlet-Frost Jiao is releasing such a strong body venom, is it possibly advancing?\u201d After Lou Mu Yan stepped into the green mist, she felt a very small energy fluctuation that came from the deep lake in the distance.A touch of surprise flashed past Ming Xiu's eyes. With this little woman's cultivation base as a Sword Spirit, she could actually discover the energy fluctuations in the depths of that cold lake. It seemed that her Mental Energy had exceeded her cultivation base by a lot.Ever since their first encounter in the Blazing Mountain Range, he had been slightly interested in her, and even inexplicably gifted her that ice bangle that had a special meaning behind it. After discovering that she was auctioning the Marrow Cleansing Pill at the auction, he asked people to collect recent information about her, then gradually, he began to pay more and more attention to her, while she attracted his attention more and more as well.A thick layer of ink rose in Ming Xiu's deep, black eyes that were like a well. So it seemed that his heart had started moving for her long ago without even knowing when.Holding that petite, soft hand, Ming Xiu's heart felt as if it were inexplicably filled with something. For the first time, there was something that could affect his calm emotions, and he not only didn't feel dislike to this type of emotion, but even wanted to be filled more with it.He could see that the little woman only felt that he was special, or was interested in him, but her heart had yet to move for him. But he wasn't in a hurry. He would slowly, step by step, take her beneath his wing, and let her, little by little, bloom only for him.Lou Mu Yan, being able to hold your hand this time means that you'll be This Highness's woman in the future, so don't even think about being able to break free for the rest of your life.1just to clarify, Immortal Cultivators is the term for the people who cultivated the path to immortality in Lou Mu Yan's previous world. (Like how here, they're called 'Sword Masters'). They're not actually immortal (though eventually they will be if they continue cultivating ofc). 'Cultivators' with a capital 'C' refers to cultivators in the previous world as well. I think I need to do some fixing in terminology in previous chapters too. I'll do that later~2just to clarify in case people feel the word 'mistress' implies a woman who has affairs with a married man (which, unfortunately, it does have that meaning), but formally, it is the counterpart to 'Master'. I did a search and it's the only word that really fits (aside from Madame but hmmm). In Chinese, the word is \u4e3b\u6bcd which translates literally to 'main mother' and \u4e3b\u5b50 just means 'master' with the \u5b50 being an affix at the end with no real meaning. Anyways, I'll stick with Mistress for this story which means main (and only) wife!Note: XD, MX being so possessive already. Obvs if our fl doesn't like it, she wouldn't let it happen either. Hehehe. And same, Mo Gui, same, rather shocking indeed. And ahhh, yay holding hands~~~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 93: Cave Within the\u00a0CaveStep by step, the two approached the cold lake where the green mist was even denser.Wave after wave of special, cold Elemental Energy wind attacked them. Lou Mu Yan felt slight pain on her skin from the breeze. Just as she was about to mobilise her Spiritual Energy to protect her body, a sudden warmth came from the palm of her hand and spread around her body. That painful feeling instantly disappeared.Lou Mu Yan glanced sideways at Ming Xiu whose expression she couldn't quite see clearly. The strength of this man was a mystery even to her. She could only feel that he was very strong.\u201cIt's starting to advance.\u201d Ming Xiu looked ahead and said.Lou Mu Yan also felt the surrounding Spiritual Force of Heaven and earth begin to swarm into the depths of the cold lake, violently swirling. But this was only just the beginning. With the fluctuation of energy from the advancement of the Scarlet-Frost Jiao being so strong, its strength shouldn't be underestimated.\u201cYou came to the Glacial Mountain Range this time for it?\u201d Lou Mu Yan always felt that the reason Ming Xiu came to the Glacial Mountain Range wasn't so simple.Ming Xiu took off the silver mask on his face, revealing that chiselled and handsome face as if having been intricately and precisely carved. His light red lips curled into a pleasant arc, \u201cTaking its Crystal Core is just in passing.\u201dWhen Lou Mu Yan saw the devilish man's face again, she couldn't help but be amazed at the exceptional beauty again. She concealed the fluctuations in her eyes and said: \u201cYou didn't happen to come to the Glacial Mountain Range for the Trial competition did you?\u201d But their low-end Selection Trial shouldn't have attracted Ming Xiu.\u201cOf course not. I came to the Glacial Mountain Range for the Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal that's about to sublimate and take shape.\u201d Ming Xiu didn't conceal it either.Hearing that Ming Xiu replaced the words 'This Highness' with 'I', Lou Mu Yan's heart skipped a beat. Removing his honorific 'This Highness' so that she and him were considered equal, was this man showing her good will?And when she heard 'Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal', Lou Mu Yan's eyes flickered brightly.The Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal could only be formed in an iceberg at least ten thousand years of age. At first, it would be in a liquid form, which was a pale golden colour. After it condensed into a Spar, it would become a dark golden. It contained an indestructible energy, with an extremely hard texture. It was one of the best main materials for refining Natal Magic Treasures.Because the conditions for formation were very harsh, it must take more than thousands of years to crystallise. So it was even a rare Spiritual Item in the Spiritual World, with one hardly found even in a thousand years. Its price would also be sky-high. Who knew that it would actually be birthed in a land where Spiritual Items were so scarce.\u201cHow do you know that it's about to sublimate?\u201d Lou Mu Yan asked curiously with a smile.\u201cA Sword King discovered it by chance when he accidentally broke into an ice volcano. But that day, the Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal was guarded by a powerful Demonic Beast. He struggled with serious injuries and had to use a Secret Skill to escaped. I rushed over when I got the news.\u201d Ming Xiu said as he pulled Lou Mu Yan forward.Lou Mu Yan's eyes revealed some understanding. The formation of ice volcanoes were extremely unique and rare. It would only be formed in ten-thousand-year-old icebergs. Underground, there birthed fiery, thick liquid that thawed the iceberg. It wouldn't erupt, but it would produce a lot of Spiritual Items, and was also one of nature's wonders.\u201cDid the Ten Distinguished Clans of the Eastern Region also receive the news?\u201d Lou Mu Yan suddenly remembered how the Ten Distinguished Clans inexplicably set the Trial site at the Glacial Mountain Range, plus Ye Qing Han's secret words, so it wasn't difficult to imagine that the Trial was a kind of camouflage.A smile of admiration rose in Ming Xiu's eyes. This little woman was indeed intelligent. From the news of the Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal alone, she could guess the purpose of the Ten Distinguished Clans.\u201cThe first one to obtain the news was precisely the Ten Distinguished Clans, and they also sealed the news. If it weren't that I just happened to be in the Eastern Region travelling, even if I received the news, I'd have arrived too late.\u201d\u201cYou mean that other Empires and big forces don't know about this news, or even if they knew, they'd arrive too late?\u201d Lou Mu Yan's eyes glowed with brilliance. If they didn't have the participation of those large entities, then maybe she'd also be able to obtain some Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal to use to refine her Natal Magic Treasure with.\u201cIndeed.\u201d Ming Xiu saw the brilliance in Lou Mu Yan's eyes, then asked with a smile: \u201cWhat, you're also interested?\u201dLou Mu Yan rolled her eyes at him and spoke with a firm tone: \u201cThose who aren't interested in such Spiritual Items must be fools. I want to refine a Magic Treasure. If I use the Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal as the main material, then it'll definitely increase its quality by a few levels. I'm definitely going to join in on the fun.\u201d\u201cYou can also refine tools?\u201d Ming Xiu couldn't help displaying surprise.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksLou Mu Yan raised her graceful chin with a little look of confidence and pride, \u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cWho knew that I picked up a treasure.\u201d Ming Xiu liked this sort of appearance on this little woman tremendously. He chuckled and held Lou Mu Yan's hand tightly.Lou Mu Yan glanced at him, then huffed: \u201cWhat does it have to do with you?\u201dAlthough she insisted that on her lips, but her smooth, jade-white face was unconsciously dyed with a layer of pink.Ming Xiu couldn't help laughing aloud, but also stopped teasing her. Although it was fun to provoke the little wild cat, but now wasn't time yet.[BOOM BOOM!!] Suddenly, a great thunder sounded from the horizon, and lighting flashed by in the distance.\u201cIt's actually facing a Thunder Tribulation and is about to transform.\u201d Lou Mu Yan's eyes revealed slight caution.Ming Xiu's eyes darkened, and he quickly pulled Lou Mu Yan towards the deep lake, \u201cGo, let's kill it before it transforms.\u201dThe two were extremely fast. With the black gem enveloping them, the green mist couldn't get close to them, so they flew into the cold lake without any obstacles and dived towards the bottom. Thunder and lightning shined brightly non-stop.A quarter of an hour later, the two dived to the bottom of the deep lake. There was a large cave entrance below, and after entering the cave, there was a very wide, open space. On the open space, some light purple Spiritual Herbs grew sporadically, and in the deepest part, there was another cave within this cave.Lou Mu Yan's eyes lit up when she looked at the few purple Spiritual Herbs that grew sporadically\u2014these were the Deep Orchids.[ROAR!!] [HISS!!] Suddenly, two beast roars with a strong and powerful pressure came from the cave within the cave, and the whole cave shook.Lou Mu Yan and Ming Xiu exchanged glances and saw the surprise in each other's eyes. It seemed that a Demonic Beast was a step ahead and had hidden itself here, wanting to ambush the Scarlet-Frost Jiao.The most important thing was that the Demonic Beast that lurked here could actually evade both their perceptions. It wasn't only strong, but it also definitely had some sort of hidden innate talent that could conceal its figure.\u201cYou guys be careful. Although the Demonic Beast that ambushed the Scarlet-Frost Jiao is only an Advanced-Phase Tier 6 Ice Toad, but it's a Mutant Demonic Beast. Not only does it have a hidden innate talent, but it also has a venom-sac. You mustn't let the venom in its sac be sprayed on you, otherwise even if you don't die, you'd become handicapped.\u201d Mo Yan stared at the cave within the cave gravely, and informed Lou Mu Yan of the information he found.After listening to Mo Yan's words, Lou Mu Yan stared gravely ahead and reminded Ming Xiu: \u201cThe one who ambushed the Scarlet-Frost Jiao is a Mutant Toad that has a hidden innate talent, and also deadly venom. Be careful after entering. You mustn't be sprayed with the venom from its sac.\u201dMing was curious, how did this little woman know the abilities of the Demonic Beast inside? When he glanced at the little white beast standing on Lou Mu Yan's shoulders, an understanding crossed his eyes.At first glance, he also regarded it as a Fire-Cloud Mink, but he always felt that something wasn't right. Just now, the little beast sent out a very slight fluctuation of Mental Energy used for probing, that he discovered, and he just happened to know this kind of Mental Energy\u2014it was precisely the King-Class Demonic Beast, the Spirit Devourer species' innate talent.At this time, he had to admire Lou Mu Yan in his heart: This little woman's eyes sure were sharp.[BOOM BOOM!!] Fierce roars and fights resounded from the cave within the cave.\u201cLet's go take a look as well.\u201dAfter Ming Xiu finished speaking, he held Lou Mu Yan and flew into the cave within the cave and added a circle of Elemental Energy shield around her for protection.Note: Awwwwww she blushed~~~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 94: Ming Xiu\u00a0ActsBefore entering the cave within the cave, Lou Mu Yan swept away all the Deep Orchids on the ground outside. The two Demonic Beasts were currently fighting, so they wouldn't bother with the Spiritual Herbs.After entering the cave within the cave, what entered their sight was a colossal, azure blue Scarlet-Frost Jiao with two front claws, sweeping its tail against a giant toad before it.The Toad's reaction speed was also very fast, and with only a few leaps, it avoided the Jiao's tail sweep. The two protruding cheeks on its face expanded and shrunk, then it opened its big mouth, spraying a yellowish-brown liquid.A series of thunder and lightning sounded, directly blasting a gap in the cave. The lightning flashes and thunder instantly struck the Scarlet-Frost Jiao's body. It just so happened that the yellow liquid also flew at it, and being unable to avoid it, the Jiao's tail was hit by the liquid, immediately corroding several bloody holes.[HISS HISS!!] The Scarlet-Frost Jiao hissed loudly in pain, but the thunder and lightning in the air didn't restrain. Instead, it slammed down even more quickly and fiercely.That Toad was also very cunning. Each time, before the thunder and lightning struck, it would dodge a certain distance, and used the moment the Scarlet-Frost Jiao was facing the Thunder Tribulation to spray its yellow liquid in a sneak attack.After Ming Xiu and Lou Mu Yan entered the cave, both Demonic Beasts discovered their existence.The Scarlet-Frost Jiao displayed joy in its eyes\u2014it had to overcome this Thunder Tribulation while dealing with the Toad, so it had absolutely no possibility of winning. With the participating of these two humans, it potentially drag it on and let itself successfully overcome the Thunder Tribulation.Meanwhile, the Ice Toad looked at the two of them vigilantly and uttered human words: \u201cHumans, This King and this Scarlet-Frost Jiao are resolving some grudges. You can leave quickly and avoid death.\u201cIce Toad, what grudges do I have with you to resolve? You are just a despicable and shameless being.\u201d The Scarlet-Frost Jiao had just finished receiving a strike from the Thunder Punishment, then spoke human words, ridiculing it\u2014and its voice was actually a female's.Lou Mu Yan's eyes revealed slight surprise\u2014so it appeared that this Scarlet-Frost Jiao was a female.\u201cHumans, get out immediately, otherwise This King will kill you all first.\u201d The Ice Toad said, looking at Lou Mu Yan and Ming Xiu fiercely.\u201cHa, just with you, a toad1?\u201d Ming Xiu chuckled, with bare disdain in his eyes.The Ice Toad was angered, \u201cYou're looking for death.\u201d It opened his mouth, and a stinking yellowish-brown liquid spouted from its mouth, shooting directly at the two.Ming Xiu let out a cold huff, put one hand around Lou Mu Yan's waist, tapped his foot casually and easily avoided the spray of venom.[HISS HISS!!] The intensity of the lightning grew stronger and stronger, and the Scarlet-Frost Jiao was bombarded time and again onto the ground, but each time it survived, the Jiao skin would begin to fall off, and there was even a protrusion on the top of its head.Seeing that the Scarlet-Frost Jiao was about to pass the Thunder Tribulation and transform into a Jiao Dragon, the Ice Toad stared obscurely at a stone deep within the cave. Then it turned its head and sprayed more than ten streams of venom towards Ming Xiu and Lou Mu Yan.Just when the Scarlet-Frost Jiao faced the Thunder Tribulation again, it suddenly made a squatting posture, and with a spring, it landed on that giant rock. It smashed the rock with one claw, and a white, fluorescent Jiao egg was exposed.\u201cYou dare!\u201d The Scarlet-Frost Jiao, who was receiving the Thunder Tribulation, yelled when it saw that the Toad's target was indeed the Jiao egg that she birthed. It turned around, forgoing the Thunder Tribulation, and opened its mouth to bite towards the Toad, allowing the rolling Thunder Tribulation to land directly on its body.[HISS HISS!!] Because she removed a part of her energy in order to attack the Toad, the Scarlet-Frost Jiao was struck by the Thunder Tribulation, and a large bloody hole was torn in its Jiao body. But it still endured the pain and ferociously bit towards the Toad.This was a mother. Even if it failed to pass the Thunder Tribulation, it must protect the safety of the child that she birthed.The Ice Toad had long expected it to be like this, so it grabbed the Jiao egg with its claws and made a pose as if to throw the egg, \u201cScarlet-Frost Jiao, if you dare bite down, then This King will shatter the egg. The little Jiao in this egg hasn't fully formed yet, so this fall will undoubtedly kill it. You better think about it clearly.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cIce Toad, you're despicable.\u201d The Scarlet-Frost Jiao retrieved the mouth it was about to bite down with and raised its head, wailing in agony.Then the last Thunder Tribulation struck its head, and blood flowed down its giant head.Because it was not in the mood to receive the previous two Thunder Tribulations and withdrew her power to deal with the Toad, its Demonic Crystal was bombarded by the Thunder Tribulation until it was exceptionally dim. For the last Thunder Tribulation, it didn't use its all to withstand it either, so it also heralded the failing of the Thunder Tribulation.Lou Mu Yan watched the Scarlet-Frost Jiao who had failed the Thunder Tribulation, its whole body scorched black by the thunder and lightning, weak, and yet it still pushed itself to block the Ice Toad from exiting the cave.\u201cLeave the Jiao egg, otherwise we die together.\u201d The Scarlet-Frost Jiao had failed to pass the Tribulation, so its life was slowly waning, and it wasn't left with much time. Its eyes were fierce, planning to die with the Toad.The Ice Toad croaked a few times and said with a sinister smile: \u201cYou still want to stop This King, being practically half-dead, you truly are dreaming. After This King refines this Jiao egg, This King can pass the Tribulation and transform, which can be considered fulfilling your wish.\u201d[HISS HISS!!] The Scarlet-Frost Jiao looked at the smooth, white egg reluctantly, then quickly burned the Demonic Energy within its body. It would rather explode and die with the Ice Toad than see its child being refined.Looking at the scene in front of her, Lou Mu Yan felt a little touched. The act of the Scarlet-Frost Jiao rather giving up passing the Tribulation to protect its Jiao egg made it so that she simply couldn't stand by and watch.\u201cMing Xiu, let's kill that Toad. If that despicable and shameless Demonic Beast really successfully passes the Tribulation and transforms, it would be a great calamity.\u201dMing Xiu also extremely despised the Ice Toad's behaviour of stealing the egg while the Scarlet-Frost Jiao was receiving the Tribulation, so he nodded: \u201cAlright!\u201dThe Ice Toad sneered at the conversation between the two of them. It had never placed any importance on either of the two humans at all, so now it was as if he had heard the funniest joke. The two people actually wanted to kill it\u2014they truly were indulging in the wildest fantasy.\u201cThose who block me die.\u201d The Ice Toad roared. Its body suddenly grew several times larger, and the pattern on its body grew deeper.It opened its mouth wide, and another mouthful of yellowish-brown liquid sprayed out. Except this time, it wasn't a stream of liquid, but instead countless shattered drops, attacking Ming Xiu and Lou Mu Yan.Ming Xiu's eyes grew colder. A fiery red shield rose from his hand and grew in size, blocking the liquid outside.He placed Lou Mu Yan in a place far from the battle location, and, holding a giant golden sword, he slashed down in the air. A violent Elemental Energy Sword Aura flew out, slashing straight towards the Toad.The Toad's eyes revealed some shock. Obviously, it didn't expect this human to emit such a powerful Sword Aura. It mobilised the Demonic Energy within it, mixed it with venom, and sprayed out a yellow beam of light to directly greet the golden Sword Aura.[BOOM BOOM!!] The energy released by the one human one beast exploded within the cave. The cave shook constantly, and countless rubble fell.After the dust dissipated, the remaining yellow beam of light was blocked by Ming Xiu's fiery red shield, then disappeared completely, while the golden Sword Aura chopped off one of its front legs.[CROAK CROAK!!] There was slight fear in the Ice Toad's eyes. It didn't expect that this quiet human actually hid his cultivation base. His strength was a major level above itself. So it grabbed the Jiao egg, mobilised its Demonic Energy and wanted to eject itself out from the cave entrance.\u201cPut down the Jiao egg.\u201d The weak and dissociating Scarlet-Frost Jiao that was burning its Demonic Energy instantly let out a burst of energy. Its Jiao tail swept violently, and the Toad that was approaching the entrance of the cave was heavily shot down onto the cave wall opposite.But it also seemed to have exhausted all its strength as its entire Jiao body collapsed to the ground, only barely maintaining its last breaths to stare, intensely, at the Jiao egg in the Toad's claws.1in Chinese, author used a more colloquial version of 'toad' (\u765e\u86e4\u87c6 l\u00e0ih\u00e1m\u00e1), but there's no real equivalent to that in English. However, 'toad' can also be slang for 'a contemptible person or thing' in English, which is basically what they're saying in Chinese too. And random note: This Chinese word '\u765e\u86e4\u87c6' is the word used in the very popular saying you see in cultivation novels: 'a toad lusting for swan meat' XD (\u765e\u86e4\u87c6\u60f3\u5403\u5929\u9e45\u8089 L\u00e0ih\u00e1m\u00e1 xi\u01ceng ch\u012b ti\u0101n'\u00e9 r\u00f2u).Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Its entire body also slowly faded, finally becoming transparent as if it had disappeared in this space.Seeing the Jiao egg flying towards a wall, almost smashing into it, the Scarlet-Frost Jiao roared and struggled, wanting to rescue it, but it was a pity that its body was injured in the roots by the thunder of the Tribulation and its Demonic Energy was all exhausted, so it could only move a few steps before collapsing to the ground, looking at the Jiao egg with extreme grief.Then, a white silhouette flashed about, and quickly landed beside the wall that the Jiao egg was about to smash into. A slender, jade hand reached out and caught the fluorescent white egg.The Scarlet-Frost Jiao was relieved upon seeing this, but at the same time, watched the human woman who held her Jiao egg vigilantly.Ming Xiu's phoenix eyes narrowed, and a strong Elemental Force was channelled into the golden longsword. With a blow towards the entrance of the cave, the Sword Aura instantly bombarded the gravel on the floor. Several cracks spread across the ground.[BOOM!] The Sword Aura slashed the air, and when it was about to reach the entrance of the cave, it sliced off a hind leg of the Ice Toad that had concealed itself.[CROAK CROAK!!] The Ice Toad collapsed to the ground and rolled over in pain as it revealed itself, displaying infinite horror in its eyes.This human was too strong. Even if it transformed, it might not necessarily be his opponent, \u201cHuman, stop. As long as you spare my life, I'll let you order about.\u201dIn order to save its little life, the Ice Toad decided to bend down temporarily and wait to regain its strength again before attempting revenge.Ming Xiu retracted the golden longsword in his hands and turned his gaze to Lou Mu Yan, \u201cWoman, what do you say?\u201d\u201cKill!\u201d Lou Mu Yan hugged the Jiao egg and said chillingly, like spring water. This sort of despicable Demonic Beast would be an eyesore even as a slave.A layer of brilliance flowed through Ming Xiu's eyes\u2014this little woman's decisiveness indeed didn't let him down. His woman did not need the excessive clemency of women. Resolute killing was the state of mind a cultivator should possess.Hearing Lou Mu Yan's words, the fake grievance in the Ice Toad's eyes changed to ferocity and viciousness. Using his last remaining legs, it hopped up and headed directly for Lou Mu Yan.When it was approaching, it opened its large mouth and sprayed an extremely stinking yellow liquid venom. This was venom essence, the most toxic venom he had. If this woman wanted it to die, then it'll drag her down together.Ming Xiu didn't expect the Toad to change the target of attack, and his expression changed. He quickly condensed an icicle in his hands and, with a flick, it shot towards the Toad.Except the icicle's speed was just a step behind the yellow venom. Seeing that the venom was about to fall on Lou Mu Yan, he shouted anxiously: \u201cWoman, be careful!\u201d With a shifting step, he was prepared to step ahead.Lou Mu Yan's face was calm and composed, and her expression didn't change even when facing the yellow venom. A single finger beneath her sleeve kept changing forms, she closed her eyes, and then her red lips opened lightly: \u201cCondense!\u201dFollowing her voice, a series of Void Talismans appeared in the air, and intertwined quickly, turning into an intangible net, blocking in front of her.Because there was a large gap between the cultivation base of the Ice Toad King and Lou Mu Yan, the Mental Energy in her Sea of Consciousness also began to brew a tempest. A dense net composed of Mental Energy flew out of her body and fell behind the net made from the Void Talismans.The venom was sprayed onto the net made up of intangible Void Talismans, but the venom was too corrosive, so the Talismans were corroded and dissipated bit by bit, while the remaining venom continued to spray towards her.Although the filtered venom wasn't as turbulent as it was in the beginning, but it still carried a stench and strong corrosiveness. If a human body was stained with it even just a little, even if they didn't die, they'd be harmed massively.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks[PUCHI!] The scattered venom fell on the dense net of Mental Energy, still highly corrosive.Then, the dense net suddenly shank, enveloping all the venom within it and flew directly back towards the Toad.The Ice Toad couldn't keep up in speed as its two feet had been sliced off, so it was nailed to a rock by the icicle shot by Ming Xiu. Just when it thought that the venom it spat would kill the woman, something it completely didn't think of shocked it.The venom wrapped in the dense net of inexplicable energy flew directly towards it. It urgently struggled, but Ming Xiu's icicle pinned it in place and couldn't be rid of. It could only watch as the venom poured down on its head from mid-air.[CROAK CROAK!!] A few shrills sounded in the cave, and the dense Mental Energy net, after splattering all the venom onto the toad's head, collapsed automatically.Lou Mu Yan's lips curled up. This venom could indeed hurt the Toad itself. What she did was called dealing with her opponent what they dealt with her, and let it also have a taste of this flavour.Only when Ming Xiu saw this, did the nervousness in his eyes gradually fade, and a devilishly handsome smile bloomed on his pretty face. This little woman's temperament truly suited his appetite.Not long after, the roar of the Ice Toad on the ground gradually diminished and finally disappeared. Its body also slowly stopped struggling and its aura was faint.Lou Mu Yan hugged the Jiao egg as she walked towards the Scarlet-Frost Jiao's side. Seeing that it was dying, yet it still looked at the Jiao egg in her hand with affection and worry, her heart moved. She placed the Jiao egg in front of it and said: \u201cReturned to you.\u201dThe Scarlet-Frost Jiao looked at the white-clothed woman before her in perplexity. Didn't they come for its Jiao egg?\u201cYou're a great mother.\u201d Lou Mu Yan said with a faint smile. The Scarlet-Frost Jiao's act of willingly forgoing the Tribulation in order to protect the Jiao egg touched her and made her feel respect.\u201cMing Xiu, let's go.\u201d At this time, Lou Mu Yan didn't want Ming Xiu to take advantage of this opportunity, when the Scarlet-Frost Jiao was in danger, to slay and take its Crystal Core. It wasn't because she was kind, but because she felt that this Demonic Beast was worthy of their respect.Ming Xiu had no more intention of killing the Scarlet-Frost Jiao either. He nodded and walked towards Lou Mu Yan. When he walked in front of the Ice Toad, he moved his finger, and the icicle instantly turned into a puddle of water.He didn't plan on taking the Crystal Core of the Scarlet-Frost Jiao, but the Demonic Beast Crystal Core of a Tier 6 Toad King was still of some use to him, so he planned to retrieve the Crystal Core.\u201cBe careful!\u201d Lou Mu Yan suddenly felt a Mental Energy fluctuation and shouted urgently.Ming Xiu naturally noticed the fluctuations as well. His eyes grew cold, then he reached out his hand and grabbed. The Toad that was meant to be dead was grabbed by him, and with a squeeze, a few mouthfuls of putrid, foul-smelling blood and venom instantly sprayed against the wall.\u201cYou still want to struggle on your deathbed?\u201d Ming Xiu looked at the Toad coldly.Only now did the Toad's eyes display a look of despair. Who would've known that he had calculated for his entire life, only for it to be ruined in the hands of a human.He wasn't reconciled. Then his eyes suddenly burst with a vicious look. The Demonic Energy poured into his Crystal Core, and his body quickly expanded.Seeing the Toad want to explode its Demonic Beast Crystal Core, but because of its hidden innate talent, Ming Xiu couldn't find the Crystal Core's location and therefore be unable to stop it, he instantly formed an ice ball in his hands, wrapped the Toad with it, and threw it out of the cave. A layer of powerful Elemental Energy shield enveloped both Lou Mu Yan and the Scarlet-Frost Jiao.[BOOM!!] A huge explosion sounded, accompanied by a yellow smoke, and the Toad's body, together with its Demonic Soul and Demonic Crystal, withered away in this worldPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The cave outside instantly collapsed, and the cave within trembled incessantly as numerous rocks blocked the entrance.A very faint yellow smoke drifted into the cave within the cave, mixed together with the dust, making it difficult to detect.Lou Mu Yan's brows furrowed as she stared at the blocked entrance, then raised her head, looking at the ceiling of the cave where a hole was blasted open by the lightning, then asked Ming Xiu: \u201cAre we going out from the top of the cave?\u201dThe location of the cave within the cave wasn't below the cold pond, and the sky above the cave was pitch black, so she didn't know where it led to.\u201cThe passage outside the cave's already blocked. I know where the top of the cave leads to, so it's alright.\u201d Ming Xiu glanced at the hole casually and replied.The two walked together and prepared to go out from the top of the cave together, while the Scarlet-Frost Jiao, whose aura was superficial now, bore pain in its eyes, then slowly looked up at Lou Mu Yan and said: \u201cWait.\u201dLou Mu Yan turned her head and looked at the Scarlet-Frost Jiao in surprise, \u201cNeed something?\u201d\u201cI beg you to take it with you.\u201d The Scarlet-Frost Jiao touched the Jiao egg affectionately with her head, sentimental and reluctant to part with, but with firmness.\u201cWhy?\u201d Lou Mu Yan was very puzzled.The Scarlet-Frost Jiao had desperately tried to protect the Jiao egg before. Although its aura was weak right now, but as long as she protected her Demonic Crystal and continued to absorb the Spiritual Force of Heaven and earth, it should survive until the being within the Jiao egg forms and breaks the shell.The Scarlet-Frost Jiao sighed, \u201cI can't protect it. The Demonic Beasts that covet it aren't just the Ice Toad. At most, I can survive until it breaks the shell, but I've already lost the ability to protect it.\u201d\u201cThen why let me take it away? You're not afraid that I'll be harmful to it?\u201d Lou Mu Yan raised an eyebrow.She wondered why a Jiao egg would attract the coveting of other high-level Demonic Beasts. She still remembered that the Toad said that as long as it ate the Jiao egg, it could transform successfully. But under normal circumstances, the Crystal Core of a Tier 6 Scarlet-Frost Jiao was much more valuable than an unformed Jiao egg.\u201cI have no other choice. You just returned it to me, which proves that you don't have a bad nature. I believe that as long as you can take it, then you will definitely not mistreat it in the future.\u201d The Scarlet-Frost Jiao paused, then with determination in her tone, \u201cI'd rather let it be your Spirit Pet than for it to be seized by other Demonic Beasts for refining and never be able to reincarnate.\u201dLou Mu Yan felt a deep maternal love for the Jiao egg from the Scarlet-Frost Jiao. The faint fluctuation in the Jiao egg that she felt earlier when she touched it also made some softness rise in her heart. She thought for a bit, then with sincere eyes: \u201cAlright! I will definitely treat it as a partner.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201d The Scarlet-Frost Jiao's misty eyes revealed gratitude.It closed its eyes and nudged its head. A gentle force pushed the Jiao egg before it towards Lou Mu Yan.Lou Mu Yan took the Jiao egg with both her hands, pressed her lips, then bit her index finger. A drop of blood essence fell on the bright white fluorescent egg. Her two fingers formed seals in the air, and she chanted a spell.Then, a layer of warm light wrapped around the one person and one egg, and a Spiritual Energy Contract Seal Talisman revolved around the Jiao egg a few times before instantly sinking into it. Immediately, it lit up brightly, and a white light shot out from the Jiao egg, shooting right into Lou Mu Yan's forehead. The contract was completed.\u201cI signed a Contact of Equals with it. It will not only be my Spirit Pet in the future, but also my life and death partner. Don't worry.\u201dIn order to let the Scarlet Frost Jiao go in peace, Lou Mu Yan entered into a Contract of Equals with the Jiao egg in front of it.The Jiao egg is from the bloodline of the Scarlet-Frost Jiao, so it could clearly feel the power of the contract. Its high-hung heart also settled down and once again said gratefully: \u201cHuman, a mere 'thank you' is an insufficient response to such a huge favour! Let these things be considered a thank you gift for taking care of it in the future.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksAfter the Scarlet-Frost Jiao finished speaking, it released a Mental Energy that shot directly towards the wall in the deepest parts of the cave. After a few sounds of rumbling, a crack appeared on the cave wall, and a pile of Spiritual Herbs and Spars, along with dozens of Demonic Beast Crystal Cores flew out and was placed in front of Lou Mu Yan.Lou Mu Yan swept the things on the floor with her eyes and nodded: \u201cI'll accept your kindness, but I want to ask you a question.\u201d\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\u201cWhy did that Ice Toad covet your Jiao egg? And based on what you said, there'll be other Demonic Beasts who want it.\u201d Lou Mu Yan had already contracted the Jiao egg, so she naturally needed to figure out the situation.The Scarlet-Frost Jiao seemed to have anticipated Lou Mu Yan's question and said without hesitation: \u201cIts father is a Golden Dragon that met with misfortune and fell onto this interface. After its injury recovered, he was forced to tear through space and leave. I initially wished that after I successfully passed the Tribulation and transformed, our family could be reunited, but it seems that it's impossible now.\u201cThat Toad and a few nearby Demonic Beast Kings know that its bloodline contained the Golden Dragon's bloodline, so they wanted to refine it.\u201d The Scarlet-Frost Jiao sighed and added.Lou Mu Yan's eyes revealed some understanding. The Golden Dragon is a superior Demonic Beast species. The blood essence of the Dragon Clan was exceptionally precious. After refining it, it could advance one's cultivation base, and was indeed very attractive to other Demonic Beasts.\u201cLeave now, the both of you.\u201d The Scarlet-Frost Jiao suddenly said.Without waiting for Lou Mu Yan's response, it glanced at the Jiao egg in her hands with yearning and sentiment, then closed its eyes peacefully and poured the last trace of Demonic Energy into its Crystal Core.Then the Scarlet-Frost Jiao's body gradually became transparent, and finally, together with the Crystal Core, turned into a blue light and flew into the Jiao egg. It left the essence of its entire life to its child.Lou Mu Yan rubbed the Jiao egg she was holding in her hand and felt a powerful energy merge with the little thing within the egg. Her face revealed slight softness.\u201cWoman, let's go.\u201d Ming Xiu walked beside Lou Mu Yan, his handsome face revealing slight tenderness.Lou Mu Yan nodded, but her face changed the moment she looked up at Ming Xiu. She immediately grabbed one of Ming Xiu's wrists and probed it, then said with an inscrutable expression: \u201cYou\u2026 are poisoned.\u201dMing Xiu looked at Lou Mu Yan in surprise but knew that she wouldn't lie. He used his Mental Energy to probe the meridians in his body but didn't find any oddity. Just as he was about to speak, he felt a hot sensation spread all over his body.A fiery sensation continued to climbed up from his lower abdomen, and at this moment, if he didn't know what poison it was, then being a man was useless.His deep, selike eyes displayed a bit of silent endurance. He swept around and found that there were still a few wisps of yellow smoke near the edge of the sealed entrance.\u201cThat damned toad.\u201d Ming Xiu immediately mobilised the ice attribute Elemental Energy to wash his entire body as he spit those words out fiercely.Lou Mu Yan followed Ming Xiu's gaze with hers, and when she found those wisps of yellow smoke, her brows furrowed together tightly.She knew that this was the poisonous gas that gathered in that Toad's scrotum when it exploded. Even Elemental Energy couldn't block it out. This sort of poisonous gas wouldn't harm the human body, but once inhaled, while it would have no effect on women, but to men, it would be as if they had eaten aphrodisiac. If it isn't relieved in time, then one would explode and die.Her face couldn't help but be dyed with a layer of worry. There was only her and Ming Xiu here\u2014unless she needed to relieve him of it? She admitted Ming Xiu was special to her, but she had not yet reached the point of sacrificing her body for him, so she could only quickly think of other ways.The yellow smoke showed its effects quickly, and after a while, Ming Xiu felt that his entire body was hot, dry, and unbearable. His lower abdomen also felt fiery and unendurable. When he smelled the faint fragrance of medicine from Lou Mu Yan beside him, he only wanted to hold her in his arms and possess her completely.But reason triumphed over desire. He bit his tongue, sped to the place farthest from Lou Mu Yan, sat cross-legged and attempted to force the poison out.His heart did move for Lou Mu Yan, but he would never take advantage of this situation to 'take her'.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But the effect of the medicine evaporated quickly, and in only a quarter of an hour, that hot desire spread through his entire body again.The moment Ming Xiu opened his eyes, he met with Lou Mu Yan's pair of beautiful eyes dyed with worry. The fire of desire in his chest burned even more vigorously. He immediately shut his eyes and muttered a calming scripture.Lou Mu Yan's brows furrowed together and couldn't help pacing back and forth. But even when she had such rich experience in her previous life, she had never encountered such a situation before.The flush on Ming Xiu's face grew darker as the ice Elemental Energy simply couldn't suppress the explosive desire at all. He bit the tip of his tongue hard to keep his reason.\u201cMo Yan, do you have any ideas?\u201d Lou Mu Yan thought and thought but still didn't have any ideas. In the end, she could only ask for help from Mo Yan on her shoulder.Mo Yan's eyes remained light, fell silent for a moment, then said: \u201cYou won't detoxify him with yourself?\u201dLou Mu Yan furrowed her brows even more and said helplessly, \u201cI don't know.\u201dIf she must use herself to get rid of Ming Xiu's poison, then she could only suffer a loss and sacrifice her body. After all, the body of a virgin seemed insignificant compared to Ming Xiu's life.Except she hadn't yet fallen in love with Ming Xiu. For her to sacrifice her body just like this to detoxify him this time, she would feel awkward and too embarrassed, so if she could get rid of it using another way, it was for the best.With complexity in his eyes, Mo Yan looked at the flamboyant, red-clothed man, who had stabbed his thigh with a sword in an attempt to stay conscious, \u201cThere is another way to save him besides you sacrificing your body.\u201d\u201cWhat way?\u201d Lou Mu Yan's eyes lit up.\u201cDoesn't the Foundation Establishment Pill you want to refine have the effect of washing the marrow and removing impurities? As long as you refine the Foundation Establishment Pill and give it to him to use, all the impurities in his body will be discharged through the pores. The poisonous gas in body will naturally be discharged together and he wouldn't need to explode.\u201d Mo Yan said lightly.Lou Mu Yan's face displayed a bit of joy\u2014that's right! As long as all the impurities and waste gas that accumulated in the body were discharged, then the poison would naturally be eliminated. It just so happened that she found the Deep Orchid, so she now had all the medicinal resources needed to refine the Foundation Establishment Pill.She immediately took out the cyan cauldron that she won at the auction, mobilised the Fire Elemental Energy from within her and tossed a tongue of flame into the cauldron.In the previous Immortal Cultivation World, if one wanted to refine pills, aside from borrowing external fire sources, one had to cultivate to the Core Formation Stage and use Pill Flames to refine. But because there were many different attributes of Elemental Energy on this Continent, as long as one comprehended the Laws of Elemental Energy to a certain level, one could use Elemental Energy Condensation.Although she could condense Fire Elemental Energy to battle when she was a Great Sword Master, but she couldn't maintain it for a long time, so she couldn't use it to refine pills. But after advancing to the Sword Spirit cultivation base, the speed of her comprehension of the Fire Elemental Law increased by a bit, so her Fire Elemental Energy Condensation could last longer, which was enough for refining pills.Of course, the Pill Flames of Cultivators at the Core Formation Stage was even better than Fire Elemental Energy Condensation.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksWhile the best source of fire for refining pills and tools, however, still came from the Mutant Flames derived from nature. But Mutant Flames were difficult to find, and even if one found one, they would be difficult to refine, so those that owned Mutant Flames were all practically the most gifted with exceptional natural talents.Lou Mu Yan quickly threw the main ingredients into the cauldron to refine one by one, baking them into powders of different colours. Then she wrapped them up with a layer of Mental Energy, placing them in one nook of the cauldron so that it wouldn't be affected by the Fire Elemental Energy.She continued to throw several kinds of auxiliary Spiritual Herbs into the cauldron to refine, one by one. In order to not waste time, she used Mental Energy to individually wrap more than ten kinds of auxiliary Spiritual Herbs to refine and roast together.\u201cAH!\u201d Suddenly, Ming Xiu's eyes were bloodshot, and he stood up. His figure that originally wanted to walk towards Lou Mu Yan halted, used his instincts to suppress the haunting, burning desire, then turned to bombard the wall of the cave punch by punch in an attempt to vent it all out.Lou Mu Yan's heart tightened, and who would've thought that the one distraction caused her to hear a 'puchi!' sound from the cauldron. A few Spiritual Herbs failed because of insufficient fire power.She took a deep breath, retracted her gaze on Ming Xiu, gradually composed her mind and slowly entered the best free and natural state she possessed in her daily life. Then she threw some more Spiritual Herbs into the cauldron and closed her eyes to start refining.The sound of gravel falling, and the entire cave rumbling resounded around her ears, but Lou Mu Yan couldn't hear it. She cut off all the disturbances from the outside world and concentrated on refining the Foundation Establishment Pill, hoping that she, who had become rather rusty now, could form a pill in one go.Time passed bit by bit and Ming Xiu's originally pitch-black eyes were now completely bloodshot. He raised his head and looked, with great difficulty, at the calm woman who was currently refining pills, which made his heart felt more serene.But the desire had already reached a point where he almost couldn't restrain it. This was the first time in his life that he was in such a sorry state, not to mention it was in front of the woman that his heart moved for.He pressed his thin lips together and made a decision.Ming Xiu struck out a few Taoist Seals, then he sat on a rock, and gradually, a layer of frost emerged on him. The frost increased little by little, and in the end, it turned into a piece of ice, sealing his entire person within it.There was a look of shock in Mo Yan's eyes. This man's perseverance and heart were really too strong. If it were another Sword Master, even if their cultivation level was exceptional, they may have long been unable to hold back and would've reached their hands towards Lou Mu Yan already.As a Demonic Beast himself, Mo Yan was well aware of the strength of the poison in that Mutant Toad's scrotum. Mental Energy and Elemental Energy couldn't block it out, and the most important thing was that it was indiscriminate poisoning. That was, regardless of if one were a normal human or a person with exceptional cultivation base, this poison had the same result.Changing his perspective, he thought to himself that even if he were still at his peak, if he were infected with this kind of poison, he might not have maintained such a long period of reason and sober consciousness like this.Moreover, Ming Xiu, this man, was ruthless to others, but was even more ruthless to himself. When his consciousness began to blur, because he didn't want to hurt Lou Mu Yan, he actually sealed himself in ice with Elemental Energy. If he failed to thaw, then he'd become an ice sculpture forever.Mo Yan glanced at Lou Mu Yan who was concentrating on refining pills, sighed, bit the tip of his tongue hard, and a drop of blood essence shot from his mouth and fell straight into the cauldron.He didn't tell Lou Mu Yan just now, but in addition to washing the marrow and removing impurities, he also needed to add his blood essence to completely detoxify the scrotum poison of that Toad. It's just that losing this bit of blood essence that was combined with his King-Class bloodline meant that all the cultivation he did since awakening had been in vain.[WENG!!] Two hours later, the cauldron made a buzzing sound, and a few bright, smooth, and lustrous pills flew out from within the cauldron, its fragrance overflowing.A slender jade-like hand made a gentle wave, and the plump and rounded pills fell into her palm. Lou Mu Yan opened her eyes and took out a porcelain bottle, placing three of the Foundation Establishment Pills in it, then held the one that was left in her hand. She stood up and was prepared to give it to Ming Xiu to use.Yet who knew that she would see a scene that shocked her and make her heart tremble. What entered her eyes was an ice sculpture and, horrifyingly, the man sealed within was precisely that red-clothed, seductively handsome Ming Xiu.Note: Awwww Ming Xiu~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She bit her lower lip and asked Mo Yan with difficulty: \u201cHe sealed himself in ice?\u201d\u201cYes. He almost lost control just now and sealed himself in ice when he almost lost consciousness.\u201d Mo Yan's light voice carried a bit of admiration.\u201cMing Xiu!\u201d Lou Mu Yan murmured to herself while holding the Foundation Establishment Pill tightly.Her heart was deeply shaken. In order to not hurt her, this man actually harmed himself instead; he actually sealed himself in ice. This act was equivalent to suicide if it wasn't controlled well.It was the first time since Mo Yan met Lou Mu Yan that he felt such a big mood swing from her. The woman who had always been calm and composed could actually tremble lightly.\u201cHe's a very strong and confident man. Don't worry, if he wasn't certain, he wouldn't be so stupid to seal himself in ice.\u201dLou Mu Yan nodded and calmed herself down. It was an absolute lie if she said she wasn't touched. This man used all his actions to prove to her that he respected her.She held the pill in her hand and walked towards that ice sculpture. She half-squatted in front of the ice sculpture and stretched out her hand to caress the man's handsome and enchanting face through the ice.She sighed softly, and a gentle colour that had never appeared before rose in her eyes.This man sure was good\u2014he won her recognition so easily. She also had to admit right now that her heart moved. For the first time in her two lives, her heart moved for a man.Then, Lou Mu Yan hugged the ice sculpture with both hands and the Fire Elemental Energy in her body flowed out incessantly. She mobilised all the Spiritual Energy within her to transform into flames, melting the ice in her embrace little by little.[Drip, drip!] The ice sculpture was melted into droplets that kept dripping to the floor by the small tongues of flames made from Fire Elemental Energy.Two hours later, the last layer of ice that separated the two of them was completely melted by the flames and tightening of her arms, she hugged Ming Xiu's body.But his body wasn't as cold as imagined and was instead rolling with heat. The flush on his face grew deeper and deeper, like a human stove, as if, if it weren't suppressed, it would explode.While feeling the fiery body of the other party, she also felt that was was another stronger force that travelled around his entire body, suppressing the heat of desire that constantly rose from his lower abdomen.It were as if a stone was dropped into the lake of Lou Mu Yan's heart, creating circles upon circles of ripples.She quickly let go of Ming Xiu, fed the pill in her hand into his mouth, then stepped back and meditated not far away from him to restore her Spiritual Energy.Just when Ming Xiu was feeling that his whole body was about to be ignited, he was suddenly embraced by a soft body with a faint fragrance of medicine, then a pill entered his mouth and instantly melted.The medicinal effects of the pill flowed down along the meridians to his dan'tian area. When he felt that his consciousness was a little fuzzy, he heard the woman's clear voice, that was pleasant to the ear as if sweet spring water, in his Sea of Consciousness.\u201cFoundation Establishment Pill, guide to the dan'tian to refine, with no distractions, first perform three macrocosmic orbits, then mobilise the Elemental Energy in your entire body to your dan'tian to filter and purify, then\u2026\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksMing Xiu's brows knitted tightly, calmed his mind, gradually tossed away that unbearable feeling of desire and heat, and followed Lou Mu Yan's telepathic words to start to refine the Foundation Establishment Pill.The medicine took effect slowly as the Elemental Energy quickly poured into his dan'tian from his entire body, filtered, then spread out again. A refreshing feeling overflowed from the meridians all over his body, making him enter a state of cultivation as if there were no one around him.Lou Mu Yan discovered that Ming Xiu had quickly entered the state of refining and a smile appeared on her lips.This man's perseverance and self-confidence exceeded her imagination. When she used Fire Elemental Energy to melt the ice around Ming Xiu's body, she discovered that he had long been prepared. Even if she didn't do anything, he could still thaw himself, albeit ending with internal injuries, but he would allow the icy air to freeze all the toxins in his body. But by doing this, it would also greatly reduce his cultivation base.Even when the feeling of burning flames struck, this guy could still enter a focused state of cultivation\u2014his heart and control were truly abnormal. Even if his cultivation base dropped, she believed that without too long, Ming Xiu could restore his strength, and perhaps be even stronger.The moment Lou Mu Yan glanced over, she found that the flush on Ming Xiu's face had receded, and traces of black smoke emerged from the top of his head. His red clothes were also blackened by the impurities that were forced out of his body. Her eyes couldn't help but reveal a touch of astonishment.Wasn't this man's talent just too strong\u2014it only took two hours for him to finish cleansing his marrow using the refined Foundation Establishment Pill, and even discharged all the impurities and poisonous gas in his body. Such a strong talent could definitely be ranked in the top ten in the Spiritual World and had even more potential than those Almighty Immortal Cultivators with rare Spiritual Roots.Feeling a flow of energy from Ming Xiu, she knew that he wanted to use the Foundation Establishment pill to stabilise his cultivation base, so she poured a Foundation Establishment Pill out from the bottle and fed it to herself, then guided its medicinal effects into her dan'tian to refine.Then, a pure energy wandered around the meridians of her entire body, finally turning into a torrent, all rushing towards her dan'tian.Time passed bit by bit, and two days flew by in the blink of an eye. The green mist that wound around Lou Mu Yan's dan'tian doubled in size, and inside her body, it also seemed to have undergone a change so drastic it was as if the Heaven and earth had flipped.Establishing a foundation was a watershed for Cultivators. If one couldn't cross it then they wouldn't be able to improve for the rest of their lives. After the Foundation Establishment Stage, one would be able to comprehend the Laws of the Heavenly Path and lay the foundation for the Core Formation and Nascent Soul more deeply.After running the pure and dense Spiritual Energy in her body in a macrocosmic orbit, Lou Mu Yan seemed to have found the feeling of when she was cultivating as an Immortal again. A sense of security born from her heart filled the depths of her Soul.With her Soul sublimated, and the medicinal effects having expelled all the impurities from the washing of the marrow by the Marrow Cleansing Pill last time, Lou Mu Yan successfully established her foundation. Her Sword Master's cultivation base also took a step ahead and advanced to Middle-Phase Sword Spirit.She opened her eyes and found that aside from Mo Yan in the cave, there was only the Jiao egg beside her. She turned her head and scanned the place where Ming Xiu sat before, but there was no one.\u201cHe went out half a day ago.\u201d Mo Yan saw the befuddlement in Lou Mu Yan's eyes and said to resolve her confusion.A softness rose on Lou Mu Yan's face, and she reached out to rub Mo Yan's furry head, which attracted a cold glare from the other party. She couldn't help but laugh out aloud, \u201cMo Yan, thank you for that drop of blood essence.\u201dShe had already noticed that Mo Yan had incorporated his blood essence into the Foundation Establishment Pill. When she was refining the Foundation Establishment Pill, she even felt a pure Demonic Beast power integrating with her meridians. When she was washing the marrow and removing impurities, it also merged with her bone marrow. Her body's toughness also heightened a level and the Flesh-Refining Skill had also reached a bottleneck.\u201cWhere's the need for politeness between you and me.\u201d Mo Yan turned his head, feeling slightly awkward as he uttered these words.Lou Mu Yan's heart warmed, and she wanted to reach out and rub his had again but was avoided by him. She restrained her smile and said: \u201cI'll refine the pill for you later.\u201dThe power contained in that drop of blood essence of Mo Yan's probably consumed all his recent cultivation. Lou Mu Yan felt indebted, so she just wanted to quickly refine the pill that can improve his cultivation for him to refine.\u201cAlright!\u201dAs soon as the words of the one human one beast fell, Ming Xiu, dressed in his flamboyant red clothes, flew down from the hole on the top of the cave that was created by the bombardment of thunder. He walked straight to Lou Mu Yan, his gaze deep and unfathomable as the endless sea while revealing a bewitching smile.\u201cWoman, you're awake!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 99: Reveal\u00a0IntelLou Mu Yan stood up and faced Ming Xiu with a light upwards curve on her lips. The two had a tacit understanding, and neither spoke of the poisoning from before.\u201cWhere did you go? Where does the top of the cave lead?\u201d Lou Mu Yan glanced at the pitch-black top of the cave and asked.Ming Xiu took out a bag of brown fruits from his interspatial ring and handed one to Lou Mu Yan, \u201cI was afraid you'd be hungry when you wake up, so I went to find some Spiritual Fruits. This mountain top isn't far from the wooden hut of your Academy's Trial site.\u201dLou Mu Yan didn't feel hungry at this point because as long as one successfully established their foundation, one didn't need to eat food anymore, but she didn't want to let down Ming Xiu's good intention.She took the fruit and copied how Ming Xiu peeled the skin, revealing a pink fruit within. She bit into it\u2014a delicious sweet and sour taste, and it even had the slight effect of strengthening bones.\u201cThis fruit is a Qi'lin Fruit1?\u201d She hadn't seen this kind of fruit in the Spiritual World before, but it was recorded in the Tian'ling Continent's Flora Record.Qi'lin Fruit generally grew in icy places and was exceptionally rare. It had the effect of helping humans and Demonic Beasts strengthen their bones. With frequent intake, it could even achieve the effect of tempering the body.\u201cYes. I see that your body is as strong as a Demonic Beast, so you must've cultivated a special body-refining skill. I happened to know a place where Qi'lin Fruit grew, so picked it all back.\u201d Ming Xiu stuffed the entire bag of Qi'lin Fruit to Lou Mu Yan, \u201cSave it and eat it slowly.\u201dLou Mu Yan wasn't quarrelsome either. Ming Xiu didn't refine his body as he used long-range attacks every time he fought, so the effect of this Qi'lin Fruit was more suitable for her, \u201cThen thank you very much!\u201dMing Xiu furrowed his brows slightly and his devilishly handsome face approached Lou Mu Yan's, chuckling as he said: \u201cWe still need a 'thank you' between you and me?\u201dA faint pale pink rose on Lou Mu Yan's extremely beautiful face. She took a step back and changed the topic, \u201cWhen will you go to the place where the Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal is sublimating?\u201dHer heart did move for Ming Xiu, but their relationship still wasn't deep enough to be together just yet. She still had other things to do. Besides, she didn't understand Ming Xiu enough, only that this person was very powerful, had a deep connection to the Ming Chamber of Commerce Alliance, and nothing else.She wanted to go with the flow. If they were interested in each other, they would eventually be together in the future by fate. She preferred feelings that came naturally. Of course, because Ming Xiu was special to her, she didn't reject his closeness.There was a smile in Ming Xiu's long and narrow eyes\u2014this little woman didn't resist his closeness, which was a good start.\u201cAccording to the intel in the reports, there should be another five or six days left for the formation of the Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal. It only takes three days from here. I still have to go to a place to find some materials for refining Magic Tools. Do you want to come with me?\u201dLou Mu Yan thought for a moment, then raised her eyes and said: \u201cI want to go back to hand in the second Trial mission first, then head to the place where the Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal's forming, otherwise I won't make it.\u201dMing Xiu's Fire Elemental Energy comprehension was even deeper than hers, so she had sighed inwardly before, that if this person wasn't a Smith, it would truly be a waste.Hearing that he wanted to find the materials to refine tools, she understood now. This guy was indeed a Smith, and his grade definitely wasn't low.\u201cAlright. I'll give you the place where the Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal's forming, and we'll meet there in six days.\u201d Ming Xiu took out an empty jade slip, placed it on his forehead and drew a picture with his Mental Energy, then handed it to Lou Mu Yan.Lou Mu Yan took the jade slip and browsed through it using her Mental Energy, remembered the map in her heart, then nodded: \u201cAlright!\u201dThe two of them didn't stay too long either as they had their own things to do. Ming Xiu wrapped an arm around Lou Mu Yan's waist and took her out of the cave within the cave in the cold pond. Then he sent her near the small wooden hut for the Trials of Yan'zhou Kingdom before hurriedly leaving.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksInside the wooden hut, Yun Cang, Lan Si and Yun Ji were discussing with each other around the furnace over tea. They all revealed surprise when they saw Lou Mu Yan enter the door.\u201cLou girl, you've already completed your second mission?\u201d Yun Cang pointed to the position opposite him and motioned for her to sit down.Lou Mu Yan nodded with a smile and took out, one by one, the twenty mission items she collected for the three to check.Lan Si picked up her mission list and checked it against the mission items, then a meaningful, gentle smile rose on his face: \u201cLou Mu Yan, isn't your efficiency a bit too fast. You only took four days to gather all the items on the mission list. You sure hide your skills well!\u201dLou Mu Yan glanced at Lan Si and was too lazy to beat around the bush with him. She rubbed the back of the little beast in her arms and said: \u201cI can find these items on the mission list this time mainly because of him.\u201dLan Si and the others followed her words and cast their gazes on the Fire Cloud Mink with what appeared to be a life-like flame on his forehead, and they came to understand.The Fire Cloud Mink's ability to find Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Items were known by all, but they didn't expect that the one won by Lou Mu Yan would be this powerful. They really didn't know if she was just lucky or because her eyes were sharp. Lan Si believed that it was the latter more.Lou Mu Yan stretched out her hand to pour herself a cup of tea, took a light slip, then raised her head to ask Yun Cang: \u201cImperial Master, may I ask if I can do the next mission yet?\u201d\u201cNot yet. You have to wait for the next round's list of names to come out before you're given a mission. But you're sure to enter the next, final round of the Trial.\u201d Yun Cang's wrinkled face revealed a rare, kind smile. Towards Lou Mu Yan's performance, he was very satisfied.\u201cHow long must we wait?\u201d Lou Mu Yan asked with furrowed brows.Seeing that she seemed to be thinking about things, Lan Si looked at her and asked with a smile: \u201cYou have something to do?\u201d It definitely wouldn't be something simple for her to ask the time so urgently like this.Lou Mu Yan reviewed the information provided by Ming Xiu in her mind. Recalling that when she pushed the door open earlier, she seemed to have heard the three mention the Ten Distinguished Clans, so she guessed that the three still didn't know about the news of the Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal for the time being.The Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal was to be birthed and the Ten Distinguished Clans concealed and sealed the news\u2014so there must be powerhouses hidden in the Trial teams. Although Ming Xiu was there, but there would be no guarantee everything was foolproof. She might as well tell this news to the three of them, which could help her better reap benefits during the confusion.\u201cYes, I'll be hurrying to a place in two days.\u201d Lou Mu Yan nodded, and then made an appearance as if she were thinking about something. After a while, she asked the three: \u201cI wonder if Imperial Teacher and Instructors have heard a piece of news?\u201d\u201cA piece of news? We haven't heard anything recently.\u201d Lan Si exchanged glances with the Imperial Teacher and continued: \u201cLou Mu Yan, don't keep us guessing. Just tell us directly.\u201dLou Mu Yan chuckled softly, took another sip of tea from the cup, then said slowly: \u201cDo you know why the pupils of the Ten Distinguished Clans came to the Glacial Mountain Range for their Trial?\u201d\u201cWe're also curious about that, but we've looked into it and found nothing unusual.\u201d Lan Si stared at Lou Mu Yan, then asked solemnly: \u201cUnless Lou Mu Yan, you heard something about it?\u201dThey also suspected that this time the Ten Distinguished Clans came to the Glacial Mountain Range with a purpose, but the news sent back by the spies weren't anything unusual. Although they were still sending people to investigate, but Lan Si just felt that Lou Mu Yan discovered some sort of secret.\u201cThe main purpose of the Ten Distinguished Clans this time isn't the Selection Trial, but rather they discovered the location of where the Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal will sublimate, and they're using the Trial as a guise to cover for their movements.\u201d Lou Mu Yan spoke of the news that even these three didn't know of firmly.\u201cWhat?\u201d Yun Cang and the others looked at Lou Mu Yan incredulously.Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal! So it was the Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal\u2014that\u00a0sort of Spiritual Treasure that was difficult to find even in a thousand years. No wonder the Ten Distinguished Clans would seal the news and use selecting the participants for the Continental Tournament for Hegemony as a cover to come to the Glacial Mountain Range for the Trial. So it turned out that they indeed had a deeper purpose.1Qi'lin (\u9e92\u9e9f) also known as kirin, no real English translation except for 'unicorn', but 'unicorn' is a different species altogether in China too (aka \u72ec\u89d2\u517d du jiao shou). Leaving it as the pin'yin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100\nJul 31, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 100: Various Parties\u00a0DispatchedThe shock in the eyes of the three weren't concealed. Hearing such explosive news made them all unable to sit still.\u201cLou girl, how did you get this news? Is it accurate?\u201d Yun Cang's expression was deep and solemn.Lou Mu Yan nodded with certainty: \u201cI'm certain the news is accurate. But it's not convenient to tell Imperial Teacher how I obtained it.\u201d For the time being, she didn't want to disclose that she and Ming Xiu knew each other to others.Yun Cang knocked on the table lightly. He guessed that Lou Mu Yan's news came from the Ling Clan. After all, the Ten Distinguished Clans sealed the news jointly and they had investigated it for so long yet received no definitive news, so it was impossible for her to obtain this secret from someone else.\u201cLan Si, Yun Ji, what do you two think?\u201d Yun Cang looked up at the two and asked after a bit, which also fully demonstrated his trust in the two.A smile of interest rose on Lan Si's gentle and refined face, \u201cSuch an opportunity, naturally we should go join the fun.\u201dThe Heavenly Frost Golden crystal was very useful to him. Since he knew that this thing was being born, then he naturally wanted to go compete for it.\u201cI also think it's necessary to join in the fun.\u201d Yun Ji's eyes also displayed some enthusiasm and desire.Yun Cang nodded, then asked Lou Mu Yan: \u201cLou girl, do you know the location of where the Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal is forming?\u201d\u201cI do. According to the intel, there is still around six days left until the formation of the Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal.\u201d Lou Mu Yan replied with a smile.\u201cWith a Spiritual Item like the Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal being formed, I believe that the Ten Distinguished Clans have also sent out experts in accompaniment. I will send a message to the Empire to ask for reinforcements.\u201d Yun Cang immediately told the two of them: \u201cWait one more day, and you two take those students who've completed the second Trial mission there. I'll arrive later.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Lan Si and Yun Ji replied.On the second day, the students participating in the Trial returned one after another. Yun Zi Mo, Lou Mu Bai, Yun Lan, Yun Jin and Xiao Zi Ang all completed their tasks before night.But what surprised Lou Mu Yan a little was that among the people who returned, aside from Ji Han Xu and Fu Chen who were within expectations, the winner of the Earth Class, who was hostile towards her, named Le Xiang also completed the second Trial mission.She lowered her eyes to hide the look in her eyes and became more wary of Le Xiang in her heart. This woman felt rather not simple to her.At night, as the time ordered by the Imperial Teacher arrived, Lan Si announced to those who had returned: \u201cCongratulations to all of you for successfully passing the second round of the Trial test. Now I have one important thing to tell everyone.\u201dSeeing the confusion in the eyes of the several people, Lan Si also stopped keeping them suspenseful, \u201cWe have received reliable intel that the purpose of the Ten Distinguished Clans coming to the Glacial Mountain Range for the Trial is actually not to compete for the quota, but because they discovered where the Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal was about to sublimate and form. I will take you there to have a look.\u201cThis time, it doesn't count as a Trial mission. The final Trial mission is to be determined and will continue after returning.\u201cOf course, if you can get even a tiny amount of Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal, then it's considered your fortuitous encounter. You don't have to hand it in to the Academy or Empire.\u201d Lan Si then added, \u201cYou can choose to go or not to go.\u201dHearing it was the Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal, the eyes of those here lit up brightly. No one wanted to miss such a good opportunity, so no one chose to withdraw.\u201cVery well. You have one night to rest. We'll leave early tomorrow morning.\u201d Lan Si's gaze swept over them with satisfaction and ordered.\u201cYes!\u201dAt night, Lou Mu Yan and Lou Mu Bai, together with the others, sat drinking tea and chatting.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksDrinking a cup of warm tea in such cold weather was very comfortable, so as long as they were within the wooden hut, Lou Mu Yan would make a pot of Spiritual Tea.\u201cYan'er, did you hear this news from the Ling Clan? Or from Ye Qing Han?\u201d Lou Mu Bai felt that it was strange ever since he learnt that the news was told to the Imperial Teacher and the others by his younger sister.The Ten Distinguished Clans were together in this, so they definitely wouldn't allow anyone to spread such news this time. That's why he constantly felt that Lou Mu Yan's source for the news wasn't from the Ling Clan or the Ye Clan, but he couldn't guess who else would know such secret information.\u201cNeither. A friend told me.\u201d Lou Mu Yan shook her head but didn't tell them about Ming Xiu. Based on what occurred during the auction last time, her elder brother and the others didn't know that guy.Lou Mu Bai's indifferent eyes grew darker, but he didn't continue to ask any more, \u201cLet's rest first. We still need to hurry over tomorrow.\u201dYun Lan and the others also saw that Lou Mu Yan didn't want to say any more, so after hearing Lou Mu Bai's words, they all sat alone and started to recover their physical strength and Elemental Energy.Outside the wooden hut, in a place hidden in the thicket, a woman stood under a big tree as if waiting for someone.Not long after, a man in a black cloak appeared next to the woman. His face couldn't be seen clearly, and his voice was hoarse, obviously deepened on purpose, \u201cHow's the plan being completed?\u201dThe woman froze, then immediately recovered her calm and said respectfully: \u201cLord Secret Envoy, Lou Mu Bai and the others always surround Lou Mu Yan, so it's difficult to act. During the second Trial mission, she was too fast, and I lost her, but now there's an opportunity.\u201d\u201cOh? What opportunity?\u201d The man suppressed the anger that made him almost berate her.\u201cThe Ten Distinguished Clans found the place where the Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal's going to form. We'll rush there tomorrow with Lan Si. By then, there'll be a lot of people snatching for it. In the confusion, it'll be much easier to get rid of Lou Mu Yan without being discovered.\u201d The woman said cautiously.The man froze for a moment, obviously not expecting to hear such news, \u201cWhat? You mean the Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal? No wonder the Ten Distinguished Clans would choose to complete their Trial in the Glacial Mountain Range. So it's because they discovered such a peak-grade Spiritual Item.\u201cDo you know when the Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal will form?\u201d The man paused, then asked with a hint of excitement in his tone.\u201cThere's still around six days before forming.\u201d The woman replied.The man drew his cloak tighter around him, then asked: \u201cDo you know the specific location?\u201d\u201cThat's not clear. Lan Si didn't tell us in detail.\u201d The woman's eyes carried with it slight obscurity.The man considered it a little, then said: \u201cAct according to the plan. When you get to the location of the Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal, you must take advantage of the chaos to find a chance to dispose of Lou Mu Yan. Of course, it would be better to kill Lou Mu Bai together as well.\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201d\u201cWhen you leave tomorrow, remember to leave a secret signal. I'll lead some people to follow secretly.\u201d From the man's throat sounded a sinister cackle, \u201cWe'll definitely obtain the Heavenly Frost Golden Crystal. When that time comes, we'll send people to cooperate with you to kill those siblings. Go back first, don't let that old bastard Yun Cang discover your identity.\u201d\u201cYes, Lord Secret Envoy!\u201d The woman quickly turned and returned to the wooden hut, while the man disappeared into the woods as if he had never appeared before.After a while, Lou Mu Yan opened her shut eyes and looked at the person, who had just pushed open the door to enter, thoughtfully.Early the next morning, Lan Si and Yun Ji led the few instructors and students who had completed their second Trial mission towards an area near the inner ring of the Glacial Mountain Range.At the same time, the Ten Distinguished Clans eliminated a portion of their pupils and let them continue using the Selection Trial as a cover, allowing various parties of superiors to lead their Clan's core pupils in the same direction.With all parties surging, in addition to the human Sword Masters, there were also many high-level Demonic Beasts appearing in the area near the inner ring of the Glacial Mountain Range, and they all headed in one direction.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
