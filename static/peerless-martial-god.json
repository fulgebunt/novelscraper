The weak is humiliated while the strong looks down on the world.Martial Spirit. The innate talent of the people in the continent is considered as the warrior\u2019s soul. It can be said that the achievements of a warrior is closely linked to their martial spirit.There are numerous types of martial spirit. Nature spirits such as fire, ice, hurricanes, lighting, etc. Weapon spirits such as knifes, guns, swords and halberd. Beast spirits such as the white tiger, the crazy rhinoceros, the violent ape and the dragon snake. In addition there are also many powerful soul spirits such as the immortal spirit.The martial spirit, it will evolve and increases its strength with its master\u2019s cultivation.The city of Yangzhou, Lin family mansionLin Feng opened his eyes and stared at the ancient and unrefined room. In this strange yet familiar room, his eyes revealed a hint of bitter frustration.\u201cTo think that I survived!\u201d Lin Feng whispered in his heart. At that moment, his bitter smile vanished and a hint of a smile appears on the corner of his mouth.That\u2019s right. He was originally a senior student from Hua Xia Jiang Nan School. However, due to a car accident, Lin Feng crossed over to another world and ended up possessing a junior that shares his name.Lin Feng felt somewhat depressed but it was not due to the face that he crossed over to another world. On Earth, he was an orphan and was single-handedly bought up by his grandfather. One day, after seeing Lin Feng\u2019s college admission notice, his grandfather finally felt relieved and died due to overworking. He left Lin Feng enough money in his bank to pay for his college. This amount of money can be considered a fortune in the village. And for his grandfather to save up this last bit of inheritance for Lin Feng, he neglected his health.Lin Feng studied very hard in college and would always get best scholarship. He wanted to rely on his own effort to change his fate, to fulfill his grandfather\u2019s wish. But Lin Feng gradually understood that no matter how hard he work and how much effort he put in, it means nothing in this era where your parent\u2019s influence plays an important role. During his senior year internship, a cocktail party was held in one of the hotels. During the party, a wealthy second generation kid made a female student that intern with him drunk. After that, people started to silently leave. Understanding what was happening; Lin Feng went to stop him.In the end, his four years of effort came to naught. He was expelled from school on the grounds of indecent assault on his female schoolmate. In fact, the evidence was irrefutable as the female identified him personally. His kind-hearted actions bite him in the end. He was sued by the female he helped as well as the wealthy kid. With both witnesses and evidences there, Lin Feng who has neither money nor influence was unable to fight against the law suit. His fate at that point of time was already sealed. Sentenced to jail for eight to ten years, he was completely derailed from society.When he saw the wealthy kid and the female schoolmate happily hugging each other when being affectionate in an Audi car, Lin Feng jumped into a random car and with a smile, he drove into the Audi. Lin Feng vaguely remembers the two fearful yet dirty faces that contain the dirtiness of this corrupted world.In his previous life, Lin Feng no longer has any lingering worries. Therefore, he was not depressed due to the fact that he crossed over to another world. He was depressed due to the factthat he seemed to have possessed the body of a trashy young master with a trashy spirit.This Young Master Lin that possesses the same name as him was originally an outer sect disciple of Yun Hai. In the Yun Hai Sect, he was frequently bullied by his own cousin, beaten nearly to death and finally kicked out of the sect\u2019s doors. It was due to the fact that the young master was half dead did Lin Feng managed to seize the opportunity to cross over and possess his body.\u201cSince I managed to gain a new life, I will never let the tragedy repeat itself\u201d Lin Feng said while he lay on his bed and clenched his fists. To the young master soul that was reluctant to completely disperse, Lin Feng said \u201cDo not worry. From now on, you are me and I am you. I will no longer let myself be bullied.\u201dHaving fused with majority of the original \u201cLin Feng\u201d soul, Lin Feng was very clear on what kind of world he is currently in. The strong is respected. As long as you have sufficient strength, all power and influence would have to bow down in front of you and this includes even the supreme imperial authority.And to those who seek to walk the Martial Arts path, not only do they need to have talent above others but they would also need to have a strong heart as well as incomparably tenacious will. The former young master \u201cLin Feng\u201d was somewhat weak but the him now is different. The current Lin Feng barely escaped death and crossed over to a different world. In addition to the pain and suffering he went through, his will is no doubt much tougher than the young master \u201cLin Feng\u201d.It was as if the soul felt Lin Feng\u2019s strong will, it finally started to slowly weakened and at last the two souls fused together perfectly.\u201cHong!\u201d The moment the soul fused together, Lin Feng felt the soul tremor and the stun knocked him unconscious. Time passes and Lin Feng finally opened his eyes again. His brow wrinkled slightly and he carefully felt the throbbing of his soul.Sitting up, Lin Feng moved his conscious. Immediately, a particular atmosphere spread. At this moment, Lin Feng felt that he was wrapped in shadow.\u201cDid you hear? Lin Feng that trash is still not awake. I bet that he is near death\u201d\u201cHa, a trash like him is better off the sooner he dies. He throws the face of the Lin family.\u201dTheir talk in the distance had travelled to Lin Feng yet he was not angry. Instead, he showed a strange look. The voices apparently transferred from a long distance away yet the him now could hear everything clearly. Not only that, he was able to hear all the noises within several hundred meters.Moreover, Lin Feng discovered that his vision became even better and he became even more sensitive to his surroundings. In addition, he suddenly understood the previously misty and unclear marital arts path.Moving his conscious once again, a small snake spirit appeared behind Lin Feng. Its small body curled up, this snake was the one that people laugh at to be a trash spirit. As the snake\u2019s species is unknown, he was unable to increase his ability.\u201cTwin Spirit!\u201dAt this moment, Lin Feng was not worried about the snake spirit. Instead, he had a stunned look on his face. Slowly, a hint of smile appeared on his face. That\u2019s right. The black mist spirit was a newly awakened spirit. Even though he does not know what type of spirit the shadow is, but with the snake spirit, he possesses two spirits.A person that was born with two spirits is also known as twin spirit. In fact, in the mainland, people who can cultivate two spirits are known as geniuses. The trash that everyone looked down on at this moment had twin spirit.\u201cLet\u2019s call you the dark spirit for now.\u201d Lin Feng showed a faint smile. To be able to have twin spirit must be due to his fused soul. Having two souls being combined into one, having two spirits is not surprising. As for this spirit\u2019s ability, at this moment it would seem that it is able to enhance his physical fitness.Closing his eyes, Lin Feng began to meditate. Slowly, the world\u2019s essence started flowing into Lin Feng\u2019s limbs and bones while nourishing the body and martial spirits.Two hours later, Lin Feng stopped meditating and started to emit a milky foul air from his nose. Right after that, he felt that his whole body became fresh and he felt carefree as even the soreness of his body disappeared.\u201cSo this is the cultivation of a warrior, fascinating.\u201d Lin Feng looked at his fist and with just a little strength, a crackling sound full of energy sounded out.The speed of his practice seems to be faster as compared to his memories. Lin Feng walked out of his room and in front of him was a huge courtyard. In the courtyard, wooden stakes and stone pillars are there for him to practice. Arriving in front of the stone pillars, Lin Feng used the martial technique \u201cNine Heavy Waves\u201d. The wind started whistling and pierced the air. It was as if space was being twisted by waves after waves.\u201cHa!\u201dAt this point of time, Lin Feng shouted. He straightened his waist and abdomen and sent out a meteor-like punch onto the stone pillar, creating a loud thunder sound. The stone pillar instantly exploded into piles of dusts and scattered onto the ground.Moreover, the air pressure continued on even after shattering the stone pillars. The air pressure produced several loud sounds and caused the air to move forward like waves. This air pressure created cracks at another stone pillar two meters away.\u201cThis punch should have over 6000jin strength.\u201d Lin Feng was very satisfied with its effect. Right now, his power has been restored to the peak and his Qi has reached the fifth layer. Even the martial technique \u201cNine Heavy Waves\u201d that he trained in has turned even stronger. Previously he could only achieve five heavy waves but now he had actually broke through to having six heavy waves. It was due to his breakthrough that he was able to use his Qi and send out 6000jin of strength.\u201cSeems like the dark spirit not only enhanced my vision and hearing but also my speed and comprehension\u201d Lin Fen smiled. He being called trash was not only due to his snake spirit but also due to his poor comprehension ability. The talented at his age would have already reach the sixth Qi layer or higher. Yet, he was only at the fifth layer. In addition, his comprehension ability was also lower as compared to the others. Even when he practiced only one martial technique, he was stuck at the fifth heavy wave, causing him to be ridiculed.But now, the cultivation problems he faced seemed to varnish with the appearance of the dark spirit. Being able to enhance the overall martial arts quality of a person, it seems that the dark spirit is no ordinary spirit.\\nNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 - Continuous BreakthroughPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 2: Continuous Breakthrough\u201cXiao Feng.\u201d The voice came from the middle-aged man standing in the courtyard. This person with a strong body and disposition looked somewhat similar to Lin Feng.\u201cFather\u201d he was indeed the head of the Lin Clan and he is also Lin Feng\u2019s father. Due to the soul fusion, Lin Feng currently possesses both the thoughts and feelings of the previous Lin Feng. Thus, he felt natural calling that person, father.\u201cXiao Feng, you\u2019re\u2026.ok!\u201d Lin Hai\u2019s face quivered. Lin Feng was sent back to the Lin Clan with his life hanging by a piece of thread and all this while he had been in a comatose state. Lin Hai had already lost all hope and started to help Lin Feng prepare his funeral. But at this moment, he was surprised to see that his son alive. How could he not be delighted?\u201cYes, Father. I have completely recovered\u201c. Lin Feng smiled when he saw how happy Lin Hai was. This gave him a very warm feeling. When his grandfather died in his previous life, he had to face the coldness of human nature alone and had never enjoyed this kind of warm feeling before.\u201cGood, Good.\u201d Lin Hai heavily patted Lin Feng\u2019s shoulder. A glint of light flashed past his eyes as he looked at the stone pillar that was turned into dust. His own brothers has been eyeing and waiting for him to fall so that they could snatch the Family\u2019s Head seat. Those bastards must be feeling rather disappointed now that Lin Feng had recovered so soon.It was at this moment did Lin Hai suddenly emit bursts of cold chills, causing Lin Feng to feel that his body had frozen.\u201cFather is indeed a strong fighter in the soul layer. Just by sending out his aura, he would be able to freeze the people below his strength.\u201d Lin Feng said in his heart. In the path of Martial Arts, the first layer would be Qi. Only by slowly directing the essence of heaven and earth into one\u2019s body, refining ** (Original text by author\u2026\u6dec\u70bc**) and training your spirit would one be able to form Qi. Thereafter, one would have stepped into the Soul layer. In the Soul layer, one can finally practice the martial arts laws. The mastery of the laws means that one will be stronger than anyone and with just one step, a man can be killed. And Lin Hai was one of the experts in the Soul layer.\u201cXiao Feng. Who did this?\u201d Lin Hai\u2019s face was gloomy. When Lin Feng was sent back, he was already half dead. This proved that the opponent had indeed wanted Lin Feng\u2019s life. And it was the truth. The opponent did wanted \u201cLin Feng\u2019s\u201d life. (TN: \u201cLin Feng\u201d in this case is the original young master that died)\u201cFather, please let your child handle this matter by himself.\u201d Lin Feng did not tell Lin Hai that he was wounded by his third uncle\u2019s son, Lin Heng. In the Lin\u2019s Family, his third uncle and eldest uncle acts in collaboration and is always coveting the family\u2019s head seat. In fact, in terms of their strength and influence, it is not much weaker when compared with Lin Hai. Adding on to the fact that Lin Heng\u2019s natural talent is rather good and he is one of the outstanding students of Yun Hai Sect, this was why Lin Heng dared to wound Lin Feng lawlessly.This hatred, Lin Feng has to pay it back himself. The way of the martial arts does not allow any regrets or it would eventually become a barrier to a warrior\u2019s training.Lin Hai looked somewhat surprised at his son and at this moment, he saw that Lin Feng\u2019s attitude has changed and his eyes was firm and resolute. He no longer showed and give off the feeling that he was weak and dispirited.It would seem like this incident was a blessing in disguise. Lin Hai was pleased in his heart and nodded his head. \u201cGo with me to the family meeting tomorrow. I would like to see how they would kick me off my position.\u201dNight time, in the Lin Family\u2019s purple bamboo forestLin Feng was sitting cross-legged on the ground and behind him was a cluster of black shadows. This shadow that has almost completely blended into the darkness was indeed the dark spirit.While training, Lin Feng discovered that when he uses his dark spirit, his practice speed is more than five times slower. Therefore, he had to push himself and ignore the additional mental fatigue that accumulated when using his dark spirit during his training. Since God had given him a second chance, he must naturally live well. In this continent, only the strong is respected and admired by people and can do anything they want.Wrapped around Lin Feng was a faint milky light that shined brightly in the darkness. This light only appears when the essences of heaven and earth have condensed to a certain extent.The talented when practising would have a faster rate of heaven and earth\u2019s essences to gathering around their body and at this moment, Lin Feng was in that state.Right now, Lin Feng was breathing steadily and looked peaceful and calm. The heaven and earth essences are flowing through his body and dissolved in his blood vessels, strengthening his bones and physique.After a long time, the light flashed and Lin Feng\u2019s body suddenly became like a black hole and in an instant, he swallowed the entire milky white heaven and earth essence into his body.Opening his eyes, a fleeting light flashed across his eyes. Lin Feng stood up and a hint of a smile appeared. He had broken through in one night to the next layer. At this moment, he has reached the sixth Qi layer.However, Lin Feng was not satisfied. From his memories, he knew that the nine Qi layers was only the starting point of martial arts. The real martial arts experts are able to fly in the sky and travel beyond the highest heaven. How carefree and happy would it be? In his previous life, that would have been seen as a God.Thinking about it, Lin Feng started to sway his fist and a whistling sound came forth. A momentary burst of wave energy caused the surrounding bamboo to explode.Qi is separated into nine layers. With every increase of one layer, his strength is increased by a thousand jin. Right now, he is in the sixth Qi layer and possesses the strength of 6000jin. And if he uses the martial technique \u201cNine heavy waves\u201d which he has trained till the sixth wave, he would be able to send out a force of 6500jin. However, it was still not enough to Lin Feng. If he was able to practise till the seventh wave, with one fierce wave after another bursting out, at that point he would be able to send out a force of 7000jin which would be equivalent to the pure strength of a warrior in the seventh Qi layer.Under the ferocious force of over 6000 jin, the fragile purple bamboo exploded endlessly. The entire space became ocean-like and the howls of the fist and its shadow were the only thing left.It was at this point of time, did one of the bamboos not explode but instead, rebounded back. When Lin Feng saw that, the speed of his punching slowed down.\u201cThe Nine Heavy Waves technique was created based on the ocean\u2019s waves. Every wave would be stronger than the previous wave and it is domineering. However, not matter how dominating it is, it would also have a gentle side. It was only when toughness and gentleness combine together would it become unprecedented.\u201dEnlightened, Lin Feng\u2019s fist was no longer constantly dominating. But instead, it was now occasionally tough yet occasionally gentle.\u201cHe\u201dLin Feng shouted while sending out a punch.\u201cHong, Hong, Hong\u2026.\u201dSounds of explosion busted out. Six booms, seven booms\u2026\u2026 eight boomsThe purple bamboos touched by the qi waves were all completely turned into dust.\u201cEight waves, strong..\u201d Lin Feng withdraws his fist and took a deep breath as he looked at the now empty space in front of him. Having gained comprehension of the \u201cNine Heavy Waves\u201d technique, he was able to breakthrough two stages and reached the eighth wave. It must be known that martial techniques become more and more difficult to train in as it reaches the later stages. For people in the fifth Qi layer, it would be easy for them to comprehend up to the fifth wave. However, people in the eighth Qi layer might not necessarily gain the comprehension to the eight waves. But Lin Feng had done it.\u201cNow that I should possess the strength of 7500jin and as long as I fully comprehend the notion of combining both toughness and gentleness together, that would be when the \u201cNine Heavy Waves\u201d technique is completed.\u201d Lin Feng felt pleased in his heart. Martial techniques would become increasingly difficult to practice in the later stages but the power of the techniques would be several time stronger. The him now possesses the strength of 7500jin. Even if he faced a warrior in the seventh Qi layer, he would still be able to put up a fight.The Lin Feng in the past was looked down on by others as he was not even able to win against a normal fifth Qi layer warrior. But the Lin Feng now, although he had only arrived in this world for a day, he had improved and now possesses the might of a seventh Qi Layer warrior.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 - Overbearing Violence \u2013 Alice 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 3: Overbearing Violence \u2013 Alice <3Early in the morning, the Lin Family appeared especially lively. This was due to the family meeting that was occurring soon and everyone is heading towards the field in the middle of the mansion.\u201cDid you hear? This time, not only did eldest uncle come, but third uncle came as well. Looks like this time they are all aiming for the family head seat.\u201d\u201cHe He, although the patriarch is strong, however that trash of a son might have already died. He was even sent back personally by people of the Yun Hai Sect, totally disgracing the face of the Lin Family. In addition, eldest uncle is always displeased with the patriarch. He would surely use this chance to launch an attack. Who knows, the family head seat might change its owner today.\u201dThroughout the journey, everyone in the Lin Family was whispering non-stop. The crowd knows that today\u2019s family meeting would surely be extraordinary.Lin Feng and Lin Hai are currently making their way to the field as well. Seeing that Lin Feng is safe and sound, hints of colors flashes past countless people\u2019s eyes. Some of them were even thinking how is this trash not dead yet. But under the might of Lin Hai, majority of them did not dare to speak their mind.\u201cThis trash sure is lucky to still be alive\u201d A shrill voice sounded out suddenly. This made majority of the people there raise their head and they saw a passerby with an extraordinary aura walk towards them.The one that spoke was a youth. He is the son of Lin Hao Ran who is the third uncle of the Lin Family. Both him, Lin Yun and Lin Feng are at the same age of fifteen. However, Lin Yun is at the sixth Qi layer.\u201cSo it was Lin Yun. No wonder he dared to say that.\u201d When everyone saw third uncle, Lin Hao Ran and eldest uncle, Lin Ba Dao, walking together, they all knew that both of them came with ill intentions.\u201cSay that again.\u201d A cold glint flashed past Lin Hai\u2019s eyes while he stared at Lin Yun. This caused a flash of fear to flutter across Lin Yun\u2019s face and he dared not look at Lin Hai directly.\u201cSecond brother, you\u2019re getting more and more outrageous as the family head. To think that the older generation is bullying the younger generation.\u201c Lin Ba Dao said in a mocking and cold tone.\u201cHa. I, Lin Hai, am still the family head. To think that Lin Yun is so uneducated, how improper is that\u201d Lin Hai responded indifferently.\u201cSecond brother is so imposing. But I\u2019ll like to see how much long you can act like this as the family head.\u201d Lin Hao Ran said in a harsh tone \u201cYour trash of a son was kicked out of Yun Hai Sect and had to be carried back home. He had completely thrown away the face of the Lin family. How could people not gossip about it?\u201d\u201cHow much longer can I stay imposing? Lin Hao Ran, are you trying to say that I may soon lose my seat as the family head? Do you think you can get this seat? Are you even qualified?\u201d Lin Hai took one step forward and a cold chill started emitting from his body. Lin Yun could only run and hide behind Lin Hao Ran as he felt his body turn ice-cold.\u201cWhether am I qualified or not, only the elders can have the final say. When did it become your turn, Lin Hai.\u201d Lin Hao Ran\u2019s face darkens. He did not expect Lin Hai to be so overbearing today and to be so unlike his usual self.\u201cSo you admitted it. I, Lin Hai am still currently the family head. For your son to curse my son to die in front of me, what sort of punishment does he deserve?\u201dLin Hai did not back off and the cold air became even heavier. The surrounding air\u2019s temperature continued decreasing and white frost were starting to form.\u201cThe family head is no doubt the family head. He gives off of aura of dignity. To think that he would be the one launching an attack on third uncle first.\u201d The crowd looked over and they all held a hint of respect and admiration for Lin Hai in their heart. They had thought that Lin Hai would passively deal with the attacks launch by third uncle and eldest uncle today.\u201cLin Hai, do you think that I am afraid of you.\u201d Lin Hao Ran came prepare. After saying that, a powerful heat wave surged out and fought head on with the chill.\u201cFather possesses the ice spirit and therefore, he mainly practices in ice techniques. However, Lin Hao Ran possesses the fire spirit and so he practices mainly in fire techniques. Water is the bane of fire. No matter how hard Lin Hao Ran fights, he would not be able to win against my father. The main lead this time is clearly not him.\u201dLin Feng who was standing at the side gazed towards Lin Ba Dao to see him revealing a hint of sneer at the corner of his mouth before saying, \u201cSecond brother, the family meeting is starting soon. Could it be that you as the head of the family deem that the elders are not even worth your attention?\u201dIn the Lin Family, the elders hold the highest authority. They exist only to appoint the next family head. Therefore, Lin Ba Dao had used the power of the elders\u2019 presence to pressure Lin Hai and make him take a step back.\u201cTsk.\u201d Lin Hai gave a look of disdain toward Lin Hao Ran and withdrew his Qi before leaving together with Lin Feng.Lin Hao Ran was naturally aware of the disdain look given by Lin Hai and cold chill flashed past his eyes. This time, your trash of a son was lucky to still be alive. But next time, he would not be so lucky.Lin Hao Ran\u2019s oldest son, Lin Heng Nai was an outstanding disciple of Yun Hai Outer Sect and it would only be a matter of time before he gets promoted to be an inner court disciple. Even if he is just an inner court junior, as the son\u2019s status grows, so does the father\u2019s. At that point of time, his position in the family would naturally go up as well. It would be to the point where a mere family head would not be able to reach.On the other hand, Lin Ba Dao\u2019s daughter is even more talented. She had already joined the inner court of the Hao Yue Sect and her future is bright and limitless. Within the three brothers, only Lin Hai\u2019s son possesses poor talent and is known as a trash. This was what Lin Ba Dao and Lin Hao Ran is relying on. Right now the elders have a much better impression of them and this is something Lin Hai can\u2019t influence.Four to five hundred people of the Lin Family had gathered in the field and in the middle of the field, there was a green stone platform. At this moment, the decision makers of the Lin Family are on it.\u201cElders, a few days ago, it was an honor for the people of the Yun Hai Sect to have come to our house. However, it was to actually send back to us a half dead trash, completely throwing away the face of our family. Therefore, I suggest disowning Lin Feng from the family. He does not have the qualifications to be a part of the Lin Family.Lin Hao Ran stood up and respectfully faced the elders while directly launching his attack.\u201cYou\u2019re actually so blunt to go straight to the point. But, I the family head have yet to say anything. When did it become your turn to talk? Go back to your position.\u201d Lin Hai knows very clearly about the goal of Lin Hao Ran. He would like to see how the other party is going to expel his son out of the family and seize the position of the family head.\u201cSecond brother, what you said is not right. Although you might be the family head, but third brother is also considered a member of the family. He was just thinking about the family. Your trash of a son had really completely thrown away the face of our family and should be expelled.\u201d Lin Ba Dao overbearing voice resounded and directly attacked Lin Hai.\u201cMy own son, I will discipline him myself. How is it related to the clansmen and it is certainly not up to you. Lin Ba Dao, I know that you have been eyeing my seat. How about this? Today, you and I would have a duel. If you win, I will leave the family with my son. However, if you lose\u2026 you better stop farting.\u201dLin Hai stood up and walked directly to the middle of the platform. Strong Qi started emitting out towards Lin Ba Dao. Even if you do not want to fight, you have to fight.Lin Feng looked at his father with a changed attitude. Aggressiveness that can scare people, only the strong will be respected. Only the strong have the right to speak. He also wanted to make the other party shut up with his own strength.\u201cI only fear that you are inadequate.\u201d Anger surged inside Lin Ba Dao when he heard Lin Hai saying that his words are farts. He walked towards the platform and stood opposite Lin Hai.All the elders remained silent. In fact, they were happy that this situation occurred. If Lin Hai could not even win against Lin Ba Dao, along with the fact that he has a trash for a son, the family head seat would naturally move today.\u201cI would like to see based on what can you be so haughty.\u201d Lin Ba Dao sneered only to see Lin Hai ignoring him. Cold chills started surrounding the stage. Hundreds of people in the audience could feel the piercing chill seeping into their body and bones at the same time.This is the power of a spirit. Lin Hai\u2019s spirit is the ice spirit. Once released, the surrounding would completely change as it gets eroded by the ice.\u201cGreat distance ice-bound\u201d Lin Ba Dao had just wanted to release his own spirit. But when he heard Lin Hai\u2019s voice, the sound of a click travelled outwards with Lin Hai as the center instantly. Cold chill covered the entire stage and spread to its surrounding. The entire platform was covered in snow white ice and at that moment, Lin Ba Dao had become frozen in ice and turned into an ice man.\u201cBoom!\u201d an explosion sounded and the ice cracked. Lin Ba Dao flew out of the platform and blood spouted out of his mouth before he fell heavily onto the ground.All the elders stood up and were shocked with the scene in front of their eyes. Lin Ba Dao had unexpectedly collapsed with only one blow.\u201cGreat distance ice-bound, Lin Hai\u2019s ice-bound technique had actually reached the eighth stage. No wonder he is so strong.\u201d The great elder eyes flashed. Lin Hai possesses the ice spirit, coupled with the powerful ice-bound technique, he had frozen Lin Ba Dao instantaneously and strike a deadly hit in one breath. If his reaction speed had been half a beat slower, I\u2019m afraid this duel would not be over so soon.The people of the Lin Family were all dazed. This was the first time they saw such a domineering Lin Hai. He was even more domineering as compared to Lin Da Bao.Lin Da Bao spouted out another mouthful of blood and looked at Lin Hai with a cloudy look. However, Lin Hai did not care. He could guess that Lin Feng\u2019s injury was undoubtedly related to his two brothers. Since they wanted to kill his son, there was no need for him, Lin Hai to take into account their brotherhood.\u201cElders, please continue with the family meeting.\u201d Lin Hai paid his respect to the elders before returning to his seat as if nothing had happened.\u201cHe, He. Lin Hai, as the family head, your cultivation had improved and you have set a good example. I believe that the people of the Lin family will work even hard. The purpose of this meeting had been reached. Everyone is free to go.\u201d Great elder gave a small smile. To continue the family meeting now would have no meaning at all.\u201cGreat elder, if that\u2019s the case, I will retire first.\u201d Lin Hai paid his respect to the great elder and stood up with Lin Feng.\u201cLin Hai, I would like to see how much long you can protect this trash.\u201d Said Lin Hao Ran coldly as his goal had not been reached.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Trash, the disgrace of my Lin Family.\u201d Lin Yun echoed. However, as he saw Lin Hai\u2019s eyes sweep past him, he quickly shut his mouth.\u201cXiao Feng, Let\u2019s go.\u201d Lin Hai did not want to bother with them. However, Lin Feng did not go. Instead, he turned around and started walking towards Lin Yun. This scene made the people of the Lin family confused as they did not know what Lin Feng is doing.Lin Hai was also looking at his son in surprise, only to see Lin Feng walking in front of Lin Yun before saying: \u201cLin Yun, you keep blabbering that I am trash. I would like to ask you, if one day you find out that you\u2019re worse than me, how humiliated would you be?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re dreaming. How could you, this trash be compared to me?\u201d Lin Yun did not expect Lin Feng, a trash to say those words to him and could not help but give off a mocking sound.Lin Feng eyes flashed and he chuckled before indifferently saying: \u201cLin Yun, I, Lin Feng, challenge you to a duel.\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 - Wielding A SwordPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Lin Feng finished speaking, the whole field had quietened down.Lin Feng took the initiative to issue a challenge to Lin Yun?Even Lin Hai was stunned and looked at his son in surprise. The elders on top of the platform who were preparing to leave, sat back down and looked at Lin Feng with great interest.Lin Hao Ran gave a cold smile yet his heart at this moment was suppressing his anger. He did not expect that the trash would take the initiative to fight his son.\u201cLin Yun, accept the challenge.\u201d Lin Hao Ran\u2019s gaze held an intense look as his eyes fell upon Lin Yun.Lin Yun looked at Lin Feng and felt insulted. In the family, his talent could only be considered ordinary. It was only in front of Lin Feng could find his pride and raise his head high up. Thus, every time he saw Lin Feng, he was more than happy to taunt him a few times. But right now, it was exactly this trash of the young generation that actually dared to challenge him, causing his face to darken.\u201cI will stop if you can receive three of my moves.\u201d Lin Yun said while walking out. He plans to defeat Lin Feng with the most brutal methods so as to let him understand how much of a trash he is.\u201cIf you can receive one of my punches, it will be considered as my defeat.\u201d Lin Feng shook his head and said indifferently. The indifferent tone sounded as if Lin Yun would not be able to receive even one of Lin Feng\u2019s punches and this caused his complexion to turn gloomy instantly.The crowd was stunned and could only look at Lin Feng speechlessly. This fellow must have gone mad. To think he would actually say something so boastful.\u201cNo matter how beautiful the words said by the trash are, he is still a trash. Using the advantage of the words, is something only a trash like you would do.\u201d Lin Yun sneered.Lin Feng laughed. He\u2019s using the advantages of words? He had only said a few words.\u201cReceive my punch\u201d Lin Feng is unwilling to waste any more time with idle talk. After his voice faded, he moved his body forward, raised his fist and immediately brandished it towards Lin Yun.\u201cOne punch?\u201d Lin Yun eyes flashed cruelly and he did not evade that punch. Instead, he raised his own fist. He wanted to let Lin Feng know the huge disparity between their skill levels.The air started vibrating and a tyrannical wave appeared on Lin Feng\u2019s fist, produced a fluttering sound. However, the crowd could only see heavy waves moving towards Lin Yun before passing through him tyrannically.Martial Technique, Nine Heavy Waves!Lin Yun\u2019s complexion changed suddenly as he felt how strong the force of oppression is. But it was too late to withdraw now. Both fists clashed and Lin Yun felt the aggressive waves travel through his fist and past his body forcefully. Each wave was stronger than the previous one and it was never-ending.\u201cPu!\u201dWith a groan, Lin Yun\u2019s body flew out. Everyone was dumbfounded. This scene was exactly the same as the fight between Lin Hai and Lin Ba Dao previously. Lin Yun, without the slightest resistance was sent flying with only a single punch.Lin Hao Ran stood up and stared dumbly at Lin Yun who was lying on the ground.\u201cHow could, how could this be possible\u2026\u201d Lin Yun was as shocked as Lin Hao Ran and was unable to accept the cruel reality.When the crowd heard Lin Yun\u2019s words, they remembered what Lin Feng had said previously. \u201cYou keep blabbering that I am a trash. I would like to ask you, if one day you find out that you\u2019re worse than me, how humiliated would you be?\u201d The present scene had without doubt proved the proud words said by the youth.\u201cThis is the trash young master of the Lin Family?\u201d Looking at Lin Feng, everyone in the audience knew that to be able to send Lin Yun flying with one punch, the punch must have at least 6000jin in strength.\u201cYou keep blabbering that I am a trash. Now that you can\u2019t even receive one of my punches, where does that leave you?\u201d Lin Feng said ironically and looked at Lin Yun with a vicious look in his eyes.\u201cAnd you. You\u2019re a senior yet you keep saying the word trash all the time. Now, your son has been defeated by me with just one punch. You\u2019re always saying that I am a piece of trash, now won\u2019t you have to say that your son is a piece of trash as well.\u201dRaising his head, Lin Feng looked over to Lin Hao Ran and said.\u201cYou\u2019re only at the sixth Qi layer. Does this insignificant strength allow you to be so arrogant here?\u201d Lin Hao Ran\u2019s face turned very ugly and rebuked him.\u201cI\u2019m not being arrogant here. I am just returning what your son and you have been giving to me.\u201d Lin Feng is unwilling to say anything more. He turned to leave and said: \u201cIf you shame others, other people will also shame you!\u201d\u201cIf you shame others, other people will also shame you!\u201d Lin Hai whispered softly and lights flashed past his smiling eyes. His own son had really changed. To think he is actually able to say such philosophical words.Lin Feng returned to his room in the courtyard and began practicing again. Although he had conquered and passed the fifth Qi layer, it was not enough for him to stand up tall. Lin Heng, who had beaten him up and threw him out of the sect doors, is naturally more talented as compared to Lin Yun. And he was currently in the eighth Qi layer.In addition, there are also Lin Ba Dao\u2019s children. Their talent can be said to be several times higher as compared to Lin Yun. Especially Lin Ba Dao\u2019s daughter, Lin Qian. It has been said that she had already reached the ninth Qi layer.In three more months, the annual meeting would be held. At that time, everyone in the Lin Family, even those who are training in the sects would come back. If he does not increase his cultivation rapidly, it would be him that would be shamed the next time.Cultivation is endless. Time passes the fastest when a warrior is practicing. To a warrior who is able to absorb the heaven and earth essences, not eating or drinking for ten days is not a problem. The world\u2019s vitality is no doubt the purest essence.Ten days had passed and Lin Feng finally stepped out of his room. He slowly exhaled a long breath. In this ten days period, he had reached the boundaries of the sixth Qi layer and would be able to reach the seventh Qi layer very soon.Quickening his pace, Lin Feng walked toward his father\u2019s, Lin Hai\u2019s room.\u201cXiao Feng, isn\u2019t it ok to practice at home. Why must you return back to the sect?\u201d Lin Hai was worried when he heard Lin Feng said that he wanted to return to the sect. Lin Hai still bears a grudge in regards to the previous incident and is unable to let it go.\u201cFather, some things are inevitable. If I hide at home to practice, father will always be sheltering me. How would I be able to grow and become a strong martial arts warrior?\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s eyes showed a strong determination. The sect\u2019s strength is much greater compared to the Lin Family\u2019s. There are strong martial techniques as well as intense competition in the sect. It is only in there would he be able to grow even faster.Seeing the stubbornness in Lin Feng\u2019s eyes, Lin Hai sighed in his heart. His son has really grown up. It is true that staying at home to practice and staying under his shelter is a cowardly behaviour. It would be impossible to become a strong martial arts warrior that way. However, standing from his point of view, he is unwilling due to his parental love towards Lin Feng.\u201cSince you insist on returning back to the sect, as your father, I will not stop you. However, you have to pay attention to your own safety.\u201d said Lin Hai as he nodded his head.\u201cDo not worry, father. I will practice hard and have them all under my foot.\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s speech held a strong sense of self-confidence. With his dark spirit, his cultivation speed is many times faster as compared to the average person. His comprehension ability had also become stronger. In addition, with a determined heart, he had reasons to believe that he would not be worse off as compared to those so-called \u201cgeniuses\u201d.Lin Feng did not bring anything much, only a horse, a bag of dry food as well as some silver.\u201cFather, I\u2019m off.\u201d Outside of Yangzhou city, Lin Feng looked at his father as he said his farewells.\u201cAh. Be careful.\u201d Lin Hai nodded.Riding the horse, thousand snows, they disappeared from Yangzhou city.In the endless vast land, Lin Feng was riding on horseback. Galloping between heaven and earth, a surge of pride and ambitions bloomed in his heart.In his previous life, Lin Feng had loved martial warriors shows. A lone knight riding a horse while singing and travelling around the world with a sword. He did not expect that in this life, he would have the chance to ride on a horse and travel through the world freely.A pot of liquor, a song of broken love, and a wild life!One hero wielding a sword and travel the world; for pride, the world will bleed and dye the green sky!In this life, he was fated to be extraordinary. In this life, he was destined to live imposingly!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 - Unsheathing the swordPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTen thousand miles separated Yang Zhou City from the Yun Hai sect, even though Li Xue could travel across a thousand miles a day, it still took Lin Feng ten days to arrive.However, during these ten days, Lin Feng didn\u2019t waste time. In his previous life, Lin Feng had never been that warm-blooded, He had never experienced such a feeling of ardor. Unwittingly, his state of mind had improved greatly. Walking on the path of cultivation had now enabled him to reach the seventh Qi layer. \u201cWhere water flows, a canal is formed\u201d as the saying goes. Besides, practicing had enabled him to master the Nine Heavy Waves martial arts technique to a new level.These days, Lin Feng possessed a much more powerful physical strength than in his previous life. His actual strength was actually close to 8500 jin which was immensely powerful for the seventh Qi Layer of cultivation.The Yun Hai sect was located in a mountain chain called Yun Hai Hill. Yun Hai Hill wasn\u2019t really the biggest mountain in that mountain chain but it covered such a big area that it was easily visible from the distant sky. Yun Hai Hill even looked like a city when looked down upon from the heavens. It was surrounded by eight mountains which, unlike Yun Hai Hill, seemed to rise into the sky as if reaching for the heavens. The Mystical beauty of this mountain owes itself to Feng Shui, it provides a great luck and destiny.As he moved closer.\u201cHalt! Come down off that horse!\u201d said two mountain guards quite coldly while giving Lin Feng a mocking smile. These two guards were also Yun Hai sect\u2019s disciples.Lin Feng looked at them in a disdainful way. Meanwhile, another disciple riding a horse rode past and continued on towards the mountain. Lin Feng pointed at him: \u201chow come you\u2019re not preventing him from getting in?\u201d.\u201cHmph\u201d, one of them smiled expressing both ridicule and anger: \u201chow can you compare yourself with the normal disciples? You almost got killed before, you piece of trash\u201d.So it was only a matter of power and status. Lin Feng smiled. These mountain guards, even though they belonged to the Yun Hai sect, were only there for decoration. Their level was so weak. However, if someone wants to come in, they must pass the mountain guards. Even though their job wasn\u2019t that important, they had the power to prevent people from getting in. Powerful disciples like the one who previously rode past didn\u2019t have to tell them anything.\u201cWeak ones must be bullied and humiliated\u201d, Lin Feng said while smiling sarcastically. He didn\u2019t come down off the horse\u2019s back, he just pulled on the reins. Qian Li Xue neighed and reared back.\u201cHow dare you, you piece of trash\u201d, yelled the two guards at the same time. Lin Feng raised his fists and punched the air creating two shock waves which struck towards the guards. The sudden extremely powerful burst of air struck them so violently that it knocked them back.\u201cIf this happens again, I will cripple you\u201d, Lin Feng hurtled by. Only those who were powerful had the possibility to express themselves. The two guards struggled back to their feet, while gasping and wiping the blood from the corner of their lips. They saw Lin Feng was already far away and it made their anger boil from within. A piece of trash was still more powerful than them, no wonder they were only fit to be mountain guards.Within the Yun Hai sect, if 15-16 year-old teenagers had reached the sixth or seventh layer on the path of cultivation, their talent was defined as average. Those who had reached the eighth layer were considered as outstanding geniuses. Everybody within the Yun Hai sect would show them admiration. As for 15-16 year-old ones who reached the Ling Qi layer, their power would be acknowledged in the entire Xue Yue country.Unlike these geniuses, if a 15 year-old doesn\u2019t make any progress within the Qi layers, they will be looked down by the others. Lin Feng\u2019s level was so low that the others called him \u201cpiece of trash\u201d. He was bullied by other people and they all considered him to be worthless trash.The fact that Lin Feng had come back to the Yun Hai sect spread very quickly amongst the sect\u2019s disciples. Lin Feng, the piece of trash, was infamous in the Yun Hai sect. Lin Feng, while walking within the sect\u2019s territory noticed people were staring at him; all of them had different expressions on their face. He turned a deaf ear to what was happening. Moving forward within the Yun Hai sect, he walked over the Xing Chen Pavilion.The Xing Chen Pavilion was a place within the Yun Hai sect where disciples were provided with various martial cultivation techniques and martial skills. Every day, many disciples would go to the Xing Chen Pavilion to practice. That day was no exception and the Pavilion was filled with disciples.Suddenly,\u201cLin Feng\u201d,Lin Feng stopped walking when he heard a voice. He looked around him and shortly after noticed a teenager whose face looked quite cold.\u201cYou\u2019re quite resilient, it seems you haven\u2019t died yet\u201d. The teenager was Lin Heng. He was the culprit who tried to murder Lin Feng last time they had seen each other, Lin Hao Ran\u2019s eldest son.Lin Feng gave him a quick glance and smiled mockingly. Lin Heng had only reached the eighth Qi layer while Lin Feng was at the seventh Qi layer but had also mastered the Nine Heavy Waves technique, he wasn\u2019t inferior to Lin Heng whatsoever. Lin Feng only had to learn and practice one or two more skills and he would certainly be able to defeat Lin Heng.Lin Feng ignored Lin Heng and immediately entered the Xing Chen Pavilion. Improve his skills and strength first, and then take his revenge.\u201cNext time, I will definitely kill you and send you home to your father to bury\u201d Lin Heng said furious to see that Lin Feng was ignoring him. Lin Heng\u2019s eyes were like piercing daggers as he stared at Lin Feng.In front of the Xing Chen Pavilion, there was an old man sitting. That old man was staring absent minded at the horizon.\u201cElder\u201d, Lin Feng bowed to greet the old man. He was the only one there to protect the pavilion. The Xing Chen Pavilion was a very important place but the old man guarding it didn\u2019t look like he was that important. It reminded Lin Feng of a film he watched in his previous life. It depicted an old powerful monk in a Shaolin temple who was simply cleaning the floor like a servant. Lin Feng thought that scene was particularly deep and unmeasurable, enigmatic and impossible to fully comprehend. As someone who had been granted a second life, he was able to understand the meaning of such actions.The old man\u2019s expression suddenly changed and he started to pay attention. He was quite surprised to see Lin Feng acknowledge him. A short moment after, he started nodding his head which expressed how pleasantly surprised he was: \u201cseventh Qi layer, you can only choose and practice skills introduced on the first floor, at most two skills\u201d.\u201cI understand\u201d, Lin Feng replied. The Xing Chen Pavilion was divided into three floors, students of a lower level didn\u2019t have access to the same resources as their fellow disciples of a higher level. The latter had a card to access these higher-level resources. Thus, lower-level disciples could only access resources on the first floor.The resources available on the first floor are all yellow-level skills and methods. However, there is a huge amount of them. It is thus possible to find skills and methods which are the most suitable for one\u2019s self. They are Yun Hai sect\u2019s basic skills and methods. All of them are better than any of the skills which can be found within Lin\u2019s family.What Lin Feng needed the most at the moment were skills so he started to look for books in the skill bookshelf.\u201cSeven-Tyrant Fist, One Tyrannical Fist \u2013 Seven lethal strikes, skill suitable for those who possess the martial spirit\u201d.\u201cHurricane blade, Transform the air itself into a weapon and launch multiple wind blades, skill suitable for people who have the air spirit\u201d.\u201cRampaging Ox, yellow level top grade martial arts skill, skill suitable for beast spirits\u201d.Lin Feng browsed through all these books quickly turning the pages and then putting them back into the shelf. He possessed the dark spirit. He was capable of strengthening all skills possible. His understanding ability was also quite high. Basically, there was absolutely no restriction when it came to learning new skills. He could learn and practice them all, which is one of the advantages of having a dark spirit. However he still could not find a skill he wanted.\u201cCool-breeze sword, Quick and skillful, using this skill must be done with natural grace and elegance, fits people who have the sword spirit\u201d.Lin Feng\u2019s facial expression changed and he suddenly stared at this book. He was looking forward to carrying a sword and traveling around in all corners of the country helping people in need and shedding the blood of those with evil intentions. He was filled with gratitude for his second chance and a thirst for vengeance. Unable to describe his feelings, he was feeling quite happy but he still had the impression that it wasn\u2019t exactly the skill that he needed or really wanted.\u201cSword unsheathing skill, sword unsheathing is a skill which kills at lightening speed, a fast one-hit kill, suitable for people who possess a sword spirit\u201d.\u201cSword unsheathing\u201d, Lin Feng stopped moving, it seemed that the use of that sword was different from that of other swords. Traditionally, what swordsmen liked the less was the moment of unsheathing a sword because it is a critical moment during which a certain amount of time is lost and thus delays the moment when the attack can be carried out. Nevertheless, sword unsheathing was a skill made to kill people. Unsheathing the sword had killing for its sole purpose. The most powerful moment of that skill was unsheathing the sword and striking with one movement, if you missed once, you could only consider yourself defeated.Furthermore, sword unsheathing wasn\u2019t the same as other skills. It had only one level, one movement. Unsheathing the sword, killing people was the ultimate attainment, the highest achievement. One quick movement and the sword is showering in the blood of your enemies.\u201cI choose it\u201d, Lin Feng took the book \u201csword unsheathing\u201d and then got ready to choose a body movement technique. After all, he had to ensure he would be able to kill in one hit at all times. If defeated, the only solution, assuming you could run fast enough, was to escape. Leaping onto roofs, vaulting over walls, was also something that could be useful but that\u2019s something everyone dreams of, right?Lin Feng then chose another book called Moonlight Feather which was a agility technique. Anyone who could master these skills could become so powerful that nobody would see them. In fact, nobody would see anything but your shadow and their own death. Gathering the books together, Lin Feng went to the old man to check them out.\u201cSword unsheathing\u201d, whispered the old man, and went on: \u201cYoung man, sword unsheathing\u2026 it\u2019s the first time that it is picked up by someone. Nonetheless, you need to know that if someone has already unsheathed their sword and you still haven\u2019t unsheathed yours, if your speed is slower than that of your opponent, the outcome is obvious, you are doomed. One can say that this skill is very powerful but it requires a high level of achievement, you must be quicker than any opponent and only then, you will be able to kill them in one hit\u201d.\u201cI understand\u201d, Lin Feng knew the elder was showing kindness in making him aware of the weakness. If someone were too slow to unsheathe their sword, then killing in one hit would be impossible and that meant putting yourself in a critical and dangerous situation.\u201cYou clearly understand the implications, then that\u2019s a good thing. If you cannot successfully kill in one hit, Moonlight Feather is an excellent movement skill for escaping\u201d. The old man stopped talking and checked out Lin Feng\u2019s books. Furthermore, books borrowed from the Xing Chen Pavilion had to be returned within one month. Borrowing them for more than a month would influence other Yun Hai sect members\u2019 training as they would be unable to borrow them as well.\u201cThank you, Elder, thank you for guiding me\u201d, Lin Feng picked up the books and politely thanked the old man showing him gratitude.\u201cUn\u201d, the old man smiled while nodding his head and handing over a flexible sword, \u201cyou can use this sword as a belt because it is very soft, this sword is of no use here anyway, you can take it and have fun\u201d.Before Lin Feng could say thanks,\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, no need to thank me so many times. Go and train!\u201d the old man noticed that Lin Feng wanted to thank him again and waved goodbye to him.Lin Feng scratched his head not knowing what to say. He took a closer look at the sword.Sword unsheathing combined with wearing the sword as a belt would enable you to attack someone by surprise and kill them in one swift motion.Lin Feng nodded, smiled at the old man and then left.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long while since I\u2019ve seen such an interesting young man\u201d whispered the old man to himself. Immediately after that, the old man got back into his initial position staring at the horizon seemingly lost in thought.These days, young people were concerned with training to improve their actual strength, but more and more did it impulsively while forgetting and neglecting the traditional foundations of martial skills.Not Sane: Since no one has picked this up since the amazing Alice dropped it, I will be continuing this project.

    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6 - The Arrow SpiritPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Yun Hai sect was surrounded by eight mountain peaks. Each of these mountains was connected with the other in perfect harmony. Yun Hai sect\u2019s disciples could thus easily go to these high-altitude mountain peaks. These mountains, which made the region a blessed heaven, were filled with caves where disciples could go and concentrate on their training in peace. These mountains were extraordinarily high and covered a vast area. Going to these mountains was therefore an easy way to find peace and tranquility for cultivation.Lin Feng was walking over a precipice decorated by overhanging rocks. He was surrounded by perilous cliffs and precipices. When looking around him, he could see a boundless sea of clouds. Such a sight would make anyone feel carefree, relaxed and joyful.However, Lin Feng did have the heart to enjoy the sight. He had been uninterruptedly practicing the sword unsheathing skill over and over again.\u201cBOOM\u201d was the sound emitted by the stones under Lin Feng\u2019s sword each time he hit them. Lin Feng\u2019s sword left a long and slender opening in the stones each time it hit.Lin Feng had already been training for seven days. He had been training without rest which could be seen by the varying sword marks on each stone.Sword unsheathing was a skill which required developing two aspects: speed and power. These two were the ultimate goal of the practice. At the moment of unsheathing the sword, a strong power was also necessary. As far as the angle at which the sword had to be unsheathed is concerned, unsheathing it at irregular angles was also necessary. Indeed, pulling it out using predictable patterns could put the user at the enemy\u2019s mercy, as he could guess what the next movement would be. The sword unsheathing skill was definitely not a regular technique.Lin Feng was dripping with sweat because he had been training every day from morning to evening. Uninterrupted practice was the only way to increase his strength. Persistently repeating the movements required a tenacious and incomparable willpower and determination. That was the only way to become stronger on the path of cultivation. Lin Feng hadn\u2019t forgotten his previous life. He couldn\u2019t forget. Although that world was filled with lofty sentiments and righteous ardor, one also had to go through hardships in that world. Being weak and lacking power could lead to getting killed. Weak and powerless, that sounded like what Lin Feng was when he almost got killed by Lin Heng.However, Lin Feng\u2019s dark spirit was gaining in vitality every minute, like he is in a trance state. He then stopped practicing the skill for a moment and recalled his spirit back into his body.The spirit was the cultivator\u2019s soul and it had to be cherished, unceasingly using it consumed one\u2019s vital essence too much.Lin Feng put his sword back into its sheath. The sheath was made of a ferocious animal skin which had a sparkling gem embedded. Then, he started training again, but this time he practiced the Moonlight Feather Agility technique.The sun which was once high in the sky was now sinking into the horizon. Lin Feng rested for a while looking at the sea of clouds making wave-like motions. On his face was a resplendent smile.He then unsheathed the sword and held it forward; watching the dark red light from the sunset slowly move down the sword, imagining it as blood flowing endlessly. He felt like a god looking down upon creation. This place gave him a view of the surrounding mountains and the aura he was currently emitting was one of strength with a ruthless coldness beneath. \u201cIt\u2019s about time to find a cave to practice\u201d. Lin Feng rested for a while, then got up and walked over to the mountains.It wasn\u2019t long until Lin Feng found a few caves for cultivation. They were always occupied by other people though. Then, Lin Feng arrived in a valley where a mountain stream was flowing. He decided to walk along the mountain stream when something drew his attention and made him stop walking.\u201cA ray of sunlight between these mountains!\u201d Before him were two peaks. The middle of these two peaks looked like the marks he left when hitting rocks with his sword. It looked very narrow in between as if the path could only accommodate two people walking side-by-side. The path looked as narrow as the ray of sunlight.\u201cI wonder what there is over there!\u201d Lin Feng thought to himself. He then moved closer with curiosity. It seemed that the mountain stream and the ray of sunlight came from the same place.At a distant place, two disciples saw Lin Feng move towards that ray of sunlight. They couldn\u2019t help but laugh at him and criticize him: \u201cthat piece of trash is not very lucky, he doesn\u2019t seem to know that is the place where our senior sister Liu Fei trains. It is quite surprising that he dares go in there\u201d.\u201cLiu Fei\u2019s strength is incomparable to ours, she is much stronger than we are, much stronger than most of our fellow disciples, a true genius. Senior Sister is the only correct way of addressing a genius such as her\u201d.While the two disciples were whispering, Lin Feng had already walked several hundred meters into the area where the ray of sunlight was coming from and finally arrived. Before his eyes opened up a wide panorama. That place was one of exceptional charm and was extremely vast. On the left was a gigantic lake out of which silk-like hot steam was evaporating. It surprisingly seemed to be a natural hot spring.\u201cIt\u2019s such a nice place, I could have bath.\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s clothes were sticking to his skin as he had been sweating heavily. He took off his top and directly jumped into the natural hot spring.\u201cSo comfortable!\u201d Lin Feng was filled with happiness when he suddenly heard a noise coming from somewhere in the water. Suddenly, he saw a girl\u2019s head come out of the water. Her hair looked very soft. It was a 15-16 year-old young girl. She had arched eyebrows and a delicate oval face. She was very beautiful. In this world, female cultivators were very beautiful because they cultivated purer bodies. She was a charming natural beauty and certainly didn\u2019t need to put make-up on.Nonetheless, that young girl\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t make her look very amicable. Her eyes were filled with flames of anger. Liu Fei was holding her breath and practicing in the water. She was very surprised to see another Yun Hai sect\u2019s disciple. Even more she couldn\u2019t stand seeing him without his top in the water where she practiced every day.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know someone was in here\u201d said Lin Feng with an apologetic smile. He then got out of the water and recognized the most beautiful female fellow disciple.Liu Fei\u2019s expression hadn\u2019t changed though and she still looked furious. Who didn\u2019t know this was Liu Fei\u2019s training place after all? Who didn\u2019t know the sunray mountain was Liu Fei\u2019s? That pervert had willingly come with the intention of seducing her.Lin Feng really didn\u2019t know someone was there though. In his previous life, Lin Feng was a coward and had never ever come to that side of the region to train.Even though Liu Fei was extremely beautiful, Lin Feng, who indeed did think she was alluring, really had no hidden intentions. He put on his clothes at lightning speed and started leaving.\u201cAnd where do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d heard Lin Feng. That was Liu Fei\u2019s voice coming from behind him as he was leaving. Liu Fei had said that with a cold and detached voice. Lin Feng turned around and saw Liu Fei holding a bow and an arrow in her hands.\u201cWhere do you think?\u201d said Lin Feng looking at her angrily. He didn\u2019t intend to seduce her. It was a mere misunderstanding and nothing more. Also, he had apologized already.She didn\u2019t reply. Liu Fei\u2019s bewitching body adopted a battle ready position. She pulled back the arrow placed in the bow in a position ready to shoot. She was ready to let it go. She shot the arrow which made a whistling sound. The golden arrow broke the air and thrusted towards Lin Feng.\u201cHow strong\u201d.Lin Feng starred at the arrow as it was moving towards him. He had absolutely no hesitation and started his Nine Heavy Wave technique. Heavy wave explosions were heard while the arrow was getting closer and closer to him.At the moment when the arrow approached so near that it was about to reach him, the arrow and the nine heavy waves collided. The arrow collapsed into the waves, hung up in the air for a few seconds before falling onto the ground.\u201cDo you want to kill me?!\u201d said Lin Feng whose voice was filled with rage. That arrow had a 7000 jin power. If it had been Lin Feng\u2019s previous life, he would have been dead already.\u201cYes, so what?\u201d said Liu Fei while pulling out another arrow. An illusory golden arrow suddenly appeared by her side.Lin Feng was shivering out of fear. A sensation of cold spread throughout his body. The illusory arrow was facing him. The illusory arrow was a guided arrow which meant it could detect if someone was alive and automatically aim at them.The arrow could automatically aim at breathing people. That was one of the particular characteristics and abilities of those who possessed the arrow spirit.\u201cBzzeeomm\u201d. The bowstring emitted a noise while the twinkling arrow moved towards him getting closer and closer.\u201cMoonlight Feather Agility\u201d, Lin Feng jumped ten meters backwards. Lin Feng had sent another wave into which the golden arrow crashed, what looked like an explosion\u2026 but that time the wave had for sole effect to slow down the arrow. It didn\u2019t stop it. The noise coming out of the collapse was scary and made Lin Feng\u2019s heart palpitate. The arrow was going straight towards Lin Feng\u2019s forehead.Liu Fei stood out from her Yun Hai sect\u2019s fellow disciples and was considered to be out of the ordinary, to be an outstanding disciple. She had reached the ninth Qi layer. Using her arrow spirit, her strength could exceed 9000 jin. Thus, Lin Feng\u2019s Nine Heavy Waves was obviously not enough to stop her arrow.Lin Feng fell down because of the energy released by the clash of the wave and the arrow. As Liu Fei\u2019s arrow spirit could control the arrow, which by the way made the arrow seem alive, she made it turn around and continued to try and kill him.\u201cAhhh\u201d shouted Lin Feng! Suddenly, the twinkling arrow vanished in a bright white light.\u201cI, Lin Feng, will always remember this\u201d.The distant voice stupefied Liu Fei. She looked around only to see her arrow cut into two. Lin Feng had already disappeared from the place. He had left at an amazing speed.\u201cThis is the arrow light\u201d whispered Liu Fei\u2026The two disciples who had watched the scene all along saw Lin Feng escape. They couldn\u2019t help but be seized with terror. Liu Fei surprisingly hadn\u2019t killed that piece of trash.Maybe Liu Fei was unwilling to fight and kill him.They had seen Liu Fei\u2019s wet clothes stick to her body. They thought about how graceful her body was. She was filled with endless charm. It made them gulp with desire. The only way for them not to drool was to keep their mouth closed. The only thing they could do was to peep and enjoy such a rare scenery.Everyone knew that Liu Fei was very powerful. Within the Yun Hai sect, many people courted her. There were some extremely skillful disciples who courted her. The two disciples who had just been peeping at her couldn\u2019t match with these extremely skillful disciples. If anyone learnt that they had seen Liu Fei\u2019s utterly attractive body, they would be killed in a very ugly way.Second release!

    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 - Black Wind MountainPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter some time Lin Feng finally arrived in a safe place. Cold feelings filled his heart. He was thinking about how the strong controlled the world and dominated the weak. He could see from this encounter that those with power in this world have no regard for human life. Indeed, if they felt like killing, then they would just kill, provided they were strong enough.He had had no intentions when going to the place where he saw the ray of sunlight inside a cave. He had just gone there to have a look and was going to leave as fast as he had went there. However, Liu Fei had wanted to kill him even though they were both Yun Hai sect\u2019s disciples.\u201cThose who have the arrow spirit have the ability to track people and engage in a battle with them using long range attacks while keeping their distance. But in the case of a close fight, I certainly would be able to kill her in one hit.\u201d Lin Feng thought using the sword was quite a satisfying experience. His speed was as fast as lightening and his strikes like thunder splitting the air. The arrow getting so near and then breaking into two was a sign that he hadn\u2019t been wasting his time training that much. He hadn\u2019t endured all this in vain.Lin Feng had been practicing without interruption for seven days back then in the mountains over the precipice. Thanks to his dark spirit, he had been able to understand many things. Only at the moment when his spirit had been using too much of his vital essence, he had recalled it back into his body and had then practiced the Moonlight Feather Agility technique.\u201cLiu Fei\u201d thought Ling Feng while recalling her beautiful face. He went and picked up a piece of wood and began making a fire to hang his clothes to dry, he was still soaking from the hot spring.Not so far away from Lin Feng appeared four shadows. All of them must have been Yun Hai sect\u2019s disciples.\u201cOver there is someone, we should invite him to join us and come along. The more powerful people who join us, the better\u201d said one of them who was wearing light green robes.\u201cBut you don\u2019t know just how powerful he is, right?\u201d said a tall, imposing disciple. Nobody, however, opposed the idea.The group of four people was composed of 3 men and 1 girl. While they were walking and approaching Lin Feng, the girl noticed Lin Feng\u2019s topless body. She couldn\u2019t help but blush. \u201cHello, can you put your clothes on?\u201d she said to him in a shy voice.Lin Feng looked at the young girl\u2019s eyes. Although she wasn\u2019t as beautiful as Liu Fei, her face was delicate and pretty. Her skin looked soft and beautiful. In her previous life, she had definitely been a beautiful girl but Lin Feng though that girls in that world were much more beautiful that in the previous world because they walked on the path of Cultivation.\u201cOk\u201d said Lin Feng cooperatively. Lin Feng was quite an easy-going person and therefore quickly agreed. Getting along with him was no hard task.\u201cSo what\u2019s the deal? What do you guys want?\u201d asked Lin Feng while putting his clothes on.\u201cAlright, the situation is as such, we want to go to the Black Wind Mountain and attack some ferocious wild beasts. We\u2019d like to invite you to come with us in which we case we would equally share precious collected items. Are you interested?\u201d explained the young man wearing light green robes. Black Wind Mountain was located northwards of the Yun Hai Mountain in the Wild Beast forest. It was extremely vast. Some disciples conjectured that the Black Wind Mountain was much vaster than the entire Yun Hai mountain chain. When the Yun Hai sect had chosen to settle in the Yun Hai Mountain, they had probably thought of the fact that the Black Wind Mountain was near. After all, wasn\u2019t it a perfect place for Cultivators to challenge themselves and test their own strength and abilities? Indeed, hunting and killing ferocious wild beasts enabled them to gather useful items while training and improving their life and death experiences at the same time.\u201cOk, I accept\u201d said Lin Feng without overthinking his answer. He really wanted to go with them and get stronger, by the quickest possible route.\u201cAwesome! That way, we are now five people, if we run into level nine ferocious wild beasts, it won\u2019t be a big deal.\u201d The young girl was obviously happy that Lin Feng had agreed to join them. The strongest Cultivator of the group was a young male disciple wearing white robes, who wasn\u2019t very talkative. He had reached the eighth Qi layer. The other three had reached the seventh Qi layer. They, including Lin Feng, were all Yun Hai sect\u2019s disciples. The three others had reached the seventh Qi layer, just like Lin Feng. Therefore, they had at least some talent, unlike his former self.Ferocious wild beasts are divided into nine levels compared to the nine Qi layers. Therefore, they all hoped not to encounter a level nine ferocious wild beast, or even stronger, which would put them in a risky and dangerous situation.\u201cYounger brother, that guy there is my fellow disciple Han Man. The girl there is my fellow disciple Jing Yun\u2026 and the guy there is my fellow disciple Jing Feng, he is also the strongest Cultivator in our group\u201d explained the young man in light green robes. The big and tall young man, called Han Man, and the young girl, called Jing Yun, gave a brief smile to Lin Feng. The toughest of them, the young man wearing white robes, looked at Lin Feng in an apathetic, nonchalant and indifferent way.\u201cMy name is Lin Feng\u201d said Lin Feng while smiling.\u201cLin Feng the piece of trash\u201d said the young man wearing white clothes known as Jing Feng. These were the first words he had said since their encounter. Lin Feng gave him a sarcastic smile. \u201cJing Yun, junior sister, it looks like we\u2019ve been wasting our time. Dragging him around will be an absolute burden.\u201dThe other three had obviously already heard Lin Feng\u2019s name before. There are many Yun Hai sect\u2019s disciples and even though they may never have met Lin Feng, they have all heard his name.Lin Feng frowned. The three others, considering the awkward situation, looked embarrassed.\u201cLin Feng, younger brother, Jing Feng is a talented man of high abilities. He has reached the eighth Qi layer on the way of Cultivation. It is hard for him to put his arrogance aside. Don\u2019t lower yourself to his level. Act as if you hadn\u2019t heard him, just ignore his remark. We are here because we want to get together.\u201d The tall and young man, called Han Man, comforted Lin Feng, against all expectations. He spoke honestly without being afraid of revealing his feelings.\u201cExactly, my senior fellow is right!\u201d said both Qing Yi and Jing Yun approving their fellow disciple\u2019s words. The young man wearing white clothes, Jing Feng, eventually groaned yet said nothing.Lin Feng saw the three others were sincere which comforted his feelings. He also didn\u2019t refuse to join them. Thus, the five of them left and started walking over to the mountains. They eventually arrived at the Black Wind Mountain.\u201cLin Feng, the Black Wind Mountain covers an extremely vast area. I am afraid only Yun Hai sect\u2019s teachers and most experienced Cultivators really know how big it is. We should always stay on the outer edges.Lin Feng nodded. He knew from the beginning that Han Man was a man of wise words and didn\u2019t intend to disagree with him whatsoever.The Black Wind Mountain\u2019s foliage was dense, filled with grass, trees, thistles and thorns. Its trees were very thick and dense which allowed for adequate places to hide. It was also a small heaven for ferocious wild beasts.\u201cLevel five breeze wolf, catch him!\u201d said Han Man suddenly. A pair of shiny eyes could be seen inside a shrub.Qing Yi pulled out his sword from his back. His sword had the color of the moon. It looked like silver mercury was flowing out of it onto the ground.\u201cTshhh!\u201d a light sound was emitted by the Qing Yi\u2019s sword as he stroke the breeze wolf\u2019s head. He had killed it in one hit.\u201cbreeze wolf\u2026 killed in a wonderful way, as expected.\u201d Said Han Man while laughing cheerfully. Han Man went to help Qing Yi to pick up useful items the level five ferocious wild beast contained.\u201cLevel five ferocious wild beast\u2026 that\u2019s all.\u201d Said the white robed and arrogant, Jing Feng, in a disdainful and apathetic tone.Lin Feng shook his head when he heard these words. He has only reached the eighth Qi layer\u2026 Although he was more than an ordinary Cultivator which did make him talented, he didn\u2019t count as a genius of an extraordinary level. Being arrogant and considering everything and everyone as worthless and inferior didn\u2019t suit his limited success.They gathered the items and continued walking. Every once in a while, they would meet a ferocious wild beast but all of them hadn\u2019t exceeded level seven so they were all quite easy to dispose of.\u201cHaha, the bag is getting heavier and heavier. We already have 30-40 items. The harvest is not too bad.\u201d Said the tall and sturdy Han Man, who was in charge of carrying the bag. He couldn\u2019t help but smile as the weight of the bag increased.\u201cBut we already walked a few dozen kilometers inside the Black Wind Mountain. We may encounter stronger and stronger ferocious wild animals. We should be careful. If it gets too difficult, we should retreat\u201d reminded Qing Yi.\u201cI understand\u201d replied Han Man while staring into the distance.\u201cLevel eight ferocious wild beast, it is a brutal ape\u201d whispered Han Man while looking in the front. The beast that appeared had a colossal body. Brutal apes are known to be extremely violent and famous for having a matchless strength that could rip apart a tiger. It is one of the strongest beasts on the edges of the forest.\u201cJing Feng, I\u2019ll stay by your side\u201d Jing Yun said to Jing Feng. A level eight ferocious wild beast couldn\u2019t hurt Jing Feng. He was much stronger than them in comparison.\u201cHehe, Jing Yun, why are you worried? It seems that there\u2019s someone enjoying the fruits of our work. He hasn\u2019t been battling at all. Does he really intend to keep relying on us without moving a single finger?\u201d said Jing Feng harshly while glancing wickedly at Lin Feng.Lin Feng laughed sarcastically. He intended to rely on them without doing anything? He hadn\u2019t fought yet because Han Man and Qing Yi had always taken the initiative to go to the front battle. They had always been the quickest to jump head first into battle. In case of real danger, would he watch with folded arms, without being affected and not lifting one finger? In the case they would meet a level eight ferocious wild beast, Jing Feng wanted to let Lin Feng fight it. After all, in Jing Feng\u2019s eyes, Lin Feng was nothing but a piece of trash. A piece of trash couldn\u2019t fight a level eight beast which meant the final outcome would be his death.\u201cJing Feng, what do you mean? Except for you, none of us is able to fight a level eight ferocious wild beast. If you let Lin Feng fight one of them, isn\u2019t the same as killing him?!\u201d said Qing Yi who was obviously not happy to hear what Jing Feng had just said.\u201cNot doing anything and sharing our items with us, isn\u2019t it cheap? If he died, wouldn\u2019t we have more for ourselves?\u201d said Jing Feng in a disdainful tone.\u201cJing Feng, we came together so we should stick and progress together! Lin Feng trusts us so we must stay together!\u201d said Han Man in a clearly bad mood.\u201cHuh? If you want to protect him, that\u2019s fine but I don\u2019t want to take care of that piece of trash for free\u201d said Jing Feng still in a cold and detached voice. At that moment, the brutal ape was already coming towards them.\u201cI will try\u201d said Lin Feng a few steps away from the level eight ferocious wild beast. That beast\u2019s strength was equivalent to that of a Cultivator who\u2019d reached the eighth Qi layer. Lin Feng wanted to challenge himself and see who really was the strongest.\u201cYou can\u2019t! If you fight a level eight ferocious wild beast, you will die!\u201d said Jing Yun very worried \u201cJing Feng, you\u2019re too pathetic!\u201dHearing these words, Jing Feng\u2019s face became really angry. He looked at Jing Yun\u2019s lithe and graceful body in a vicious manner, \u201cif you were not a beautiful girl, I would have already disciplined you\u201d.\u201cI\u2019m coming to help you\u201d said Han Man while putting down the bag full of items. He then went to Lin Feng\u2019s side.\u201cCount me in as well,\u201d said Qing Yi doing the same as Han Man.\u201cAnd me as well, are the three of us able to defeat that ferocious wild beast?\u201d said Jing Yun silently praying in her head.\u201cYou are overestimating yourselves and your abilities\u201d said Jin Feng behind them while laughing in an arrogant way. The level eight brutal ape is a very aggressive and extraordinary strong beast. A few Cultivators who have reached the seventh Qi layer cannot defeat such a monster.Lin Feng glanced at those who had joined him and felt had a warm feeling deep in his heart. He warmly smiled at them.scratching his nose to express his lack of confidence, Lin Feng said: \u201cperhaps, I can\u2019t fight this ferocious wild beast\u2026 only perhaps.\u201dAs promised here is chapter 7.

    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 - Hell WolfPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 8: Hell WolfLin Feng\u2019s words made Jing Yun stupefied the two others, they glanced at Lin Feng with astonishment. Immediately after that, they saw Lin Feng dash forward without hesitation.\u201cLin Feng, this is not the right situation to show off your abilities\u201d, Jing Yun said worryingly. Even though they had never seen Lin Feng in a fight, they all knew he was well known for being a piece of trash. Even if these days, Lin Feng had been exerting himself to train really hard, his level was at most the same as theirs, but he wanted to see if his strength matched that of a level eight brutal ape, how could that be possible?It was too late, he had already dashed forward before anyone could stop him. The brutal ape saw that he actually had the audacity and impertinence to move forward to attack. It stamped furiously on the ground with its thick muscular legs making the ground vibrate under its steps, as its colossal body was speedily advancing towards Lin Feng. The brutal ape had vicious eyes as it charged forward gaining more speed. It looked like a mountain of thick furred muscle was trying to charge Lin Feng, creating earthquakes in its path.It seemed that Lin Feng didn\u2019t know how strong the level eight demonic beast was which made Jing Yun\u2019s heart jump with fright. Jing Yun was so frightened that she could barely breathe. The beast was brazenly rushing towards Lin Feng.Jing Yun had the feeling that Lin Feng was going to be trampled and crushed beneath the ape\u2019s thick muscular legs. She was so scared that she closed her eyes, unable to watch the horrifying scene.\u201cBOOM!\u201d. A titanic shockwave trembled throughout the air. Jing Yun, whose eyes were closed clearly felt the entire space shake and vibrate. Then, she heard the brutal ape roar in a violent rage.When she opened her eyes, she just saw the brutal ape lying on its back three meters away. Lin Feng had silently moved back to her side, looking miraculously unharmed, it seemed it had been no problem at all.\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Jing Yun couldn\u2019t believe her eyes, Lin Feng hadn\u2019t suffered the slightest injury during the collision with the brutal ape. She looked at Qing Yi and Han Man only to see that their eyes were as wide open and filled with astonishment just like her. They had seen with their own eyes that Lin Feng had repelled the brutal ape with ease. That scene had shocked them to the core.However, that was a level eight monster, without a basic power of 8000 jin, it would have been impossible to defeat the brutal ape, let alone defeat it with seemingly no effort.Behind, Jing Feng was also stunned, stumped for words. The piece of trash had repelled a brutal ape? Unbelievable!\u201cLevel eight Brutal Ape\u2026 it should have high quality leather and plenty of thick meat\u201d whispered Lin Feng. These days, he had reached the seventh Qi layer and his practice had solid foundations. Added to that, he had mastered the Nine Heavy Waves technique which allowed him the strength of 8500 jin. Besides, the essence of the Nine Heavy Waves technique was determined by the accumulation of powerful shock waves combining to produce an explosion of power many times greater than the original waves. Therefore the waves, at the moment when they hit the brutal ape, must have reached an explosive power close to 9000 jin. At that moment though, the brutal ape stood back up, letting out a bloodcurdling roar and sending itself into a frenzy.Lin Feng dashed forward, closer to the roaring brutal ap. He started using his Nine Heavy Waves again and thrust his arm out emitting a loud \u201cBOOM!\u201d. The brutal ape\u2019s body was colossal making it impossible to avoid the attack in time. Thus, it had no choice but take the attack head on and resist as much damage as possible.\u201cLet me test my skills on you.\u201d Said Lin Feng while calmly walking towards the brutal ape. Suddenly his left fist thrust forward, violent waves began to combine and rush up his arm and out of his fist. \u201cBOOM!\u201d\u201cCRACK!\u201dA violent cracking sound like the snapping of twigs quickly followed.Jing Yun and the others were all astonished at the scene. brutal ape? At that moment, Lin Feng was even more brutal and beast like than the brutal ape. Unceasingly punching using his technique Nine Heavy Waves, showing no signs of stopping. The vibrations in the air were sweeping over several hundred miles. Layer upon layer of insanely oppressive waves were sweeping over the area which demonstrated to everyone exactly how powerful he was.\u201cHe\u2019s really making full use of the Nine Heavy Waves technique! He\u2019s using it in such a skillful way! The power is on a completely different level! He has brought his technique to the point of perfection, which many are not capable of reaching in this lifetime.\u201d Qing Yi definitely didn\u2019t think Lin Feng could be called a piece of trash.\u201cThe air is still full of Lin Feng\u2019s power, the waves are not stopping. I\u2019ve heard that understanding how to use and control Nine Heavy Waves to higher levels is extremely difficult. Lin Feng\u2019s natural talent is amazing\u201d Said Jing Yun looking lost in thought.\u201cMonstrous\u201d said Han Man scratching his face and looking gloomy.\u201cBzzzzz\u201d the shaking feeling stopped and the area became calm again. Lin Feng turned around and looked at the three others: \u201cyou guys come pick up the precious items, I am too exhausted.\u201d\u201cOh\u201d said Han Man realizing the brutal ape was already a beaten corpse. His lip was trembling with excitement at the precious materials. Taking all of the precious items from the brutal ape\u2019s body required great strength. Its skin was extremely thick. Even though it was dead, it was extremely difficult to split its skin open. Lin Feng must have transformed into something not of this world considering how he had violently slaughtered the brutal ape.\u201cHaha, Lin Feng, you\u2019re monstrously skillful. Let\u2019s just hope we do not come across level nine ferocious wild beasts though, we might not be able to stop them\u201d Han Man said while laughing cheerfully. He then put the items in the bag and put it on his back.Lin Feng laughed and said: \u201clet\u2019s keep moving forward, perhaps we\u2019ll come across some more level eight ferocious wild beasts.\u201d\u201cThat was just a stroke of luck. That beast couldn\u2019t strike back\u201d said a sarcastic voice coming from behind them. They then saw Jing Feng walk past and walk ahead.\u201cJing Feng, you\u2026\u201d Jing Yun and the two others looked furious. That guy really had a spiteful mouth. Twisting the story like that.The group continued to walk. While Jing Feng was walking in the front and was expecting ferocious wild beasts to come out allowing him to demonstrate his superior skills, but no living thing would approach, there were no signs of life in any direction. Jing Feng was furious.\u201cIt seems like something is wrong here\u201d Lin Feng said. That part of the forest, compared to other parts, was exaggeratedly calm and quiet.\u201cSomething is wrong indeed\u201d Qing Yi and the two others, who had been walking quite fast, started to slow down and noticed Jing Feng, who was walking ahead, was coming back closer to them.Everyone was looking at Jing Feng and suddenly a Hell Wolf appeared in front of him. The wolf had a hideous twisted face. It looked like a demon.Seeing the face of a Hell Wolf was so unbearable that Jing Yun covered her mouth with both hands. She started shaking out of pure fear.\u201cThe hell wolf is a level nine ferocious wild beast. Within the group of ordinary beasts, he is by far the cruelest one. It likes to eat people slowly one bite after the other without immediately killing them which makes your death a long and excruciating one\u201d Said Qing Yi with a trembling voice. It seemed that they had just run into the one monster that every Cultivator feared the most when coming to the Black Wind Mountain: the hell wolf. Not only was the hell wolf extremely cruel but it was also so quick that it was near impossible to escape from it.\u201cPiece of trash, we\u2019re fighting this one together. You use your Nine Heavy Waves to distract him, while I look for every opportunity to kill him\u201d said Jing Feng while stepping back towards the others. His voice was deep and forceful. He was obviously talking to Lin Feng.\u201cPiece of trash? You want me to come distract him so that you can find an opportunity to escape with your tail between your legs?\u201dLin Feng said with a grin: \u201cYou attempted to throw me to my death, you thought I was just going to trust you?\u201d\u201cYou have no choice, otherwise everyone will die\u201d said Jing Feng boiling with rage, while continuing to move backwards.\u201cI don\u2019t think that way though. It seems like you haven\u2019t fought yet. You want to live off us without moving a single finger. I am not willing to feed a piece of trash for free though\u201d said Lin Feng, his grin getting bigger. Lin Feng had thrown Jing Feng\u2019s own words back in his face.While talking, Lin Feng glanced at the others who were standing by him to make them retreat to a safe distance.Jing Yun and the two others retreated without a second thought. The hell wolf they were facing would only kill them if they confronted him. Besides, Jing Feng\u2019s recent behavior had bitterly disappointed them. Free from affectation, they were not going to rush ahead and help.\u201cAlright\u201d said Jing Feng while looking at them in anger. A sharp slice of air was suddenly formed by a bright and splendid sharp sword which appeared behind Jing Feng\u2019s body.\u201cSword spirit.\u201dLin Feng was astounded. No wonder that guy was so arrogant. Amongst all the spirits that existed, the sword spirit was one of the strongest and most powerful spirits. Those who possessed the sword spirit could carry out powerful sword attacks and kill in one hit.Because the sword spirit was a powerful one, many Cultivators who didn\u2019t possess the sword spirit practiced hard to develop their sword skills. For example, Qing Yi who possessed a wind spirit was extremely quick which enabled him to be skillful and agile at using a sword.The long sword was unsheathed and such a dazzling gleam shone that it blinded everyone.The hell wolf roared and suddenly threw himself towards the others. Its sharp claws refracted tiny rays of light.The sword, which looked like a rainbow, and the cold sharp claws of the hell wolf collided emitting a thunderous sharp metallic sound.\u201cIts claws are quite sharp!\u201d Thought Lin Feng to himself. The hell wolf was, as expected, not an ordinary beast. The sharp claws of the hell wolf and the sword had collided with each other. The hell wolf was so powerful that its strength had thrown Jing Feng ten meters backwards. A big crater appeared where they clashed. Jing Feng had obviously endured an exceptionally powerful attack.As the hell wolf\u2019s claws were about to touch the ground, it had already jumped again not allowing Jing Feng chance to relax. It moved fast as a lightning.Jing Feng moved his sword, letting neither wind nor rain pass through to him in a pattern that looked similar to a spider web. He then stepped back and found out that the hell wolf had eventually disappeared from his sight.Above!Jing Feng was absolutely horrified. He had absolutely no hesitation, he threw his long sword high in the air and rapidly moved back.\u201cBastard!\u201d Cursed Jing Yun. Jing Feng simply couldn\u2019t win against the hell wolf, so he threw his sword and escaped without caring about the others.\u201cIf I die, you will die too.\u201d Jing Feng\u2019s facial expression was hideous. He went towards them.\u201cFuck off!\u201d Lin Feng said and used his Nine Heavy Waves and thrust his fist towards Jing Feng.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s waves were so powerful that Jing Feng got thrown back. Immediately after that Jing Feng gave a blood-curdling scream. The hell wolf\u2019s claws were deep into his back, blood splashed and he fell down onto the ground.\u201cYou want to die?!\u201d Said Lin Feng whose facial expression was ice-cold. If you abandoned others, they\u2019d abandon you. In Lin Feng\u2019s case, if you attacked him, he\u2019d strike back.\u201cOwww wooooo!\u201d The hell wolf was howling. He let lose wild shrieks and howls. Its claws were still on Jing Feng\u2019s body on the ground. It was not hurrying to kill Jing Feng. The hell wolf\u2019s cold eyes were looking at Lin Feng which gave everyone the chills.\u201cWhat\u2019s to be done? The wolf is hurting him but not killing him because it likes to kill its prey slowly. It likes to make its prey suffer to an extreme extent\u201d said Qing Yi while looking at Jing Feng seeing that he was unable to fight it anymore. It gave Qing Yi a dreadful sensation.\u201cWhat is the hell wolf\u2019s weakness?\u201d Asked Lin Feng suddenlyQing Yi looked at Lin Feng in a surprised way.\u201cThe hell wolf is a very quick attacker, its attacks are strong and powerful. It can\u2019t protect itself very well. Its neck is especially vulnerable, but it can use its sharp claws to protect itself. If you want to reach its neck, you must deal with its claws first\u201d said Qing Yi while his forehead was dripping with sweat. Lin Feng\u2019s Nine Heavy Waves could cover a large area and had an insanely strong power. Nine Heavy Waves wasn\u2019t a quick attack, for him to avoid the hell wolf\u2019s claws and reach its neck seemed like an impossible task.They were trapped. If they tried to escape the hell wolf would catch them with ease, they could only stay and watch as they one by one were tortured to death. Lin Feng to everyone\u2019s surprise took a step forward accidently while still in thought. The hell wolf\u2019s ears pricked and it was now coldly glaring at the group, its razor sharp claws dripping blood\u2026.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 - Throat Slitting SwordPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cArghh!\u201d Lin Feng had noticed his mistake while stepping forwards.He had just made a small step. It scared Jing Yun gulped as the fear welled up in her throat. What did Lin Feng intend to do? The hell wolf was the second cruelest beast after the soul spirit beast. Even some of the most skilled Cultivators who reached the ninth Qi layer would have no other choice but to run and escape from a hell wolf.Without taking the time to tell them what he was about to do, Lin Feng had started running towards the hell wolf, gaining more and more speed with each step.Seeing what was happening, Jing Yun was overcome with fear, the others were also terrified beyond belief.\u201cAahhh woooooo!\u201d The hell wolf started howling in surprise when it saw Lin Feng was running directly towards him. The hell wolf\u2019s demon like face looked hideous. Its eyes were gleaming with an extremely cold light. The sight would chill even experienced warriors.The hell wolf, whose claws were still slowly piercing in and out of Jing Feng\u2019s body, jumped in the air with a blood-curdling howl. Its body slowly turned black and a brilliant white light began glowing over its body, covering its whole black body in a white radiance.\u201cLin Feng! Come back!\u201d Shouted Jing Yun but it was already too late. Lin Feng started using his Moonlight Feather Agility and his speed sharply increased to reach the highest speed possible.Qing Yi and Han Man were so frightened that they were frozen stiff. Their hearts were beating so fast that it seemed like time had stopped for a moment. They did not have any time to realize what was happening before the fight had already started.An amazingly bright meteor-like streak suddenly appeared in the air in front of the wolf. When the light vanished, it seemed like time had stopped. Lin Feng had stopped moving, all signs of life were gone. The hell wolf landed triumphantly with a growl.Silence\u2026Jing Yun\u2019s hands were covering her mouth. She looked on at the scene terrified. Lin Feng was actually dead\u2026It was suddenly so quiet. \u201cGrrr-aawoo\u2026\u201d. The hell wolf fell down on its side with shock filling its eyes. On its neck was a mark, which looked like an extremely thin red silk thread out of which was flowing a small endless stream of blood.\u201cThe hell wolf died!\u201d Said Han Man and Qing Yi while looking at the scene before them, gasping with astonishment.\u201cLin Feng, how do you feel?\u201d Asked Jing Yun, whose voice was febrile, while looking at Lin Feng who was still standing on his feet but no longer moving, not even a sign of breathe could be seen.Jing Yun\u2019s voice dropped in intensity. Qing Yi and Han Man were also very nervous to see Lin Feng like that. They had seldom been that nervous.Finally, Lin Feng moved. He slowly turned around. His eyes were sparkling and he was grinning wholeheartedly.\u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d said Lin Feng spreading his arms out in a stretching motion. He remembered the instant he had attacked. Sword unsheathing, it had looked a silver firefly streaking across the sky. It was lightening fast with such unbelievable power. One of the prerequisites of the sword unsheathing skill was, of course, to be faster than the opponent.\u201cPheww!\u201d Jing Yun let out a sigh of relief. They could finally relax again. They had the feeling that they were back to themselves, the same as when they originally met Lin Feng in the mountains.Instead of talking, they were looking at Lin Feng as if he was a monster.\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d Said Lin Feng embarrassed while scratching his face. The way they were looking at him made him feel like he had forgotten to put on clothes, it was unnerving.\u201cMetamorphosis!\u201d Han Man, whose teeth were clenched, said only that one word. Lin Feng was quite puzzled by the fact that Ying Jun and Qing Yi were solemnly nodding showing that they felt the same as Han Man.\u201cLin Feng\u2026 you have a sword spirit\u2026\u201d Qing Yi obviously knew that the light which streaked through the air a moment ago had been caused by a sword. Only a sword could have been that quick.\u201cYou\u2019re misunderstanding, I just learned a sword skill\u201d nodded Lin Feng. Only those who had the sword spirit and a powerful sword could master sword skills.\u201cI\u2019m misunderstanding? How could it be that you don\u2019t have a sword spirit?\u201d Asked Qing Yi showing obvious suspicion.\u201cI really don\u2019t have a sword spirit\u201d said Lin Feng shaking his head. Qing Yi breathed in a mouthful of cold air. How could someone who didn\u2019t have a sword spirit use a sword at the speed of lightning? Lin Feng\u2019s skills were terrifying. For example his Nine Heavy Waves technique, he could already master that technique at the highest possible level of achievement.\u201cI am suspecting you are able to practice and use skills belonging to all categories. Am I right?\u201d Asked Qing Yi forcing a timid smile while shaking his head. He hadn\u2019t asked what Lin Feng\u2019s spirit was though. After all, there were some people whose spirits were so strong and powerful that it enabled them to use skills belonging to different categories. Those kind of people would not share the true identity of their spirits. Besides, Lin Feng hadn\u2019t even used his spirit so far. Therefore, it made it difficult for Qing Yi to guess what Lin Feng\u2019s spirit was.Lin Feng was just smiling. At that moment, it indeed seemed like Lin Feng was able to learn and practice any kind of skill. Besides, it also seemed that he had a strong learning ability.\u201cA level nine ferocious wild beast\u2026 This time we\u2019re collecting lots of precious items\u201d said Han Man with a smile on his face. He took out his dagger and started carving up the precious materials from the body of the beast while talking: \u201cLin Feng, you killed that hell wolf on your own. If you hadn\u2019t been here, then we\u2019d be dead by now. These materials are yours and only yours.\u201d\u201cJing Yun, Qing Yi, you have no objection to that, right?\u201dQing Yi and Jing Yun smiled and agreed, if Ling Feng hadn\u2019t been there, they would have died a cruel and horrifying death.\u201cI don\u2019t agree. Everything we picked up from the beasts until now should be divided equally among the four of us\u201d said Lin Feng shaking his head. When the others thought he was a weak Cultivator, they made him walk behind them. Even though the entire reward could be his for killing the hell wolf on his own, Lin Feng wasn\u2019t the kind of person who saw profit and forgot morality.They all saw Lin Feng had determination in his eyes and nodded one after the other and said: \u201calright\u201d.\u201cYou guys seem like you\u2019ve forgotten about me\u201d said a weak voice. It was Jing Feng, who else could it be?Jing Feng had been attacked by the hell wolf and his back had been shredded into pieces. The hell wolf had trampled him and crushed his bones. At that moment, Jing Feng was unable to get back on his feet and was looking up at Lin Feng and the others from his pitiful state on the ground.\u201cDamn it! Get lost!\u201d Said Han Man extremely aggressively cursing at Jing Feng. Not only had that bastard let them fight against the brutal ape alone, even though it was extremely dangerous, but he was also the one who had led the hell wolf towards them and had forced them to deal with it even though they could have died.\u201cLet\u2019s go. He can put his life in the hands of the gods\u201d said Jing Yun who was furious.As the four of them were about to leave, they heard Jing Feng say in a ghastly tone: \u201cyou guys shouldn\u2019t forget that my older brother knows that we came to the Black Wind Mountain together. If I die and that you get out of here alive, what is my brother going to think?\u201dHan Man and the others stopped walking and turned around looking at Jing Feng with hesitation.\u201cThe best solution is for you to bring me back and share the precious items with me. Otherwise, you will die.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Asked Lin Feng. That guy was half-dead yet still insane enough to arrogantly threaten them.\u201cHis brother, Jing Hao, is one of the best disciples, currently sixth on the rankings. He\u2019s an extremely powerful Cultivator who has reached the ninth Qi layer. He also has a sword spirit. He\u2019s extremely strong\u201d explained Qing Yi to Lin Feng who immediately understood.Lin Feng started walking and went towards Jing Feng with an ice-cold smile on his face.\u201cTrash, help me get up\u201d said Jing Feng ordering Lin Feng.Lin Feng was stupefied and with something like a smile yet not a smile on his face said to Jing Feng: \u201cI really admire your courage.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s voice dropped. He unsheathed his soft sword. Lin Feng was emitting a cold blood chilling glare.\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Asked Jing Feng feeling oppressed from head to foot, a feeling a chill run down his spine.\u201cLin Feng!\u201d shouted Qing Yi. Jing Hao was an amazing disciple, the sixth best Cultivator of the sect. He was extremely strong. Even though Lin Feng was extremely strong as well, his level was still low after all. Qing Yi didn\u2019t think that Lin Feng could offend Jing Hao.Lin Feng looked at Qing Yi and the two others and asked them: \u201cin view of his behavior, do you think that if we rescue him, he will just let us off?\u201dThe groups faces all instantly froze. Cold sweat was flowing down their back. Indeed, Jing Feng\u2019s expression was obviously revealing that if they rescued him, he was most likely planning something sinister.\u201cWe have never offended him. He thinks he is always in the right. Then, he\u2019ll make false charges against us again. That will be our end. Not only has he not mended his attitude, but he also ordered us to save him. On top of that, he also wants us to equally share all our items with him. Do you still want to save such a person?\u201dLin Feng patiently explained these things to them. Even though they were all precocious, they were all only 15-16 after all. Lin Feng who had gone through a lot, in his previous and current life, had more experience.The three others all nodded to what Lin Feng had said. They were indeed scared that if they brought Jing Feng back, Jing Hao would seek revenge for Jing Feng.Lin Feng turned around, looked at Jing Feng and saw that he was, at last, frightened.\u201cI swear that if you bring me back, I will not seek revenge, and also I will not ask you to share any of the gathered items\u201d said Jing Feng while crawling pathetically on the floor.\u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d Lin Feng unsheathed his sword which flashed in a dazzling gleam and cut off Jing Feng\u2019s throat. When your life is at stake, who would trust your words? If only Jing Feng had seen his errors earlier, he may have received mercy.Lin Feng was looking at Jing Feng, his eyes were open, but no life could be seen, they just stared at Lin Feng in shock. Lin Feng\u2019s heart was pounding. Of course, on such a journey, blood and corpses were hardly avoidable things, but he was still inexperienced.\u201cIf Jing Hao comes and looks for you, tell him the truth, tell him that I\u2019m the one who killed Jing Feng\u201d said Lin Feng looking indifferent while smiling. Lin Feng was not scared of Jing Hao just because he had reached the ninth Qi Layer.I felt like giving everyone something in the morning to brighten their day.Since I have had a few comments and personal messages, I would like to clarify some things.My name\u2019s not Alice, that is the translator who worked on the first 4 chapters. So the 4 messages I have moderated saying I need to learn better english, well these do not really apply to me.Yes my grammar is turrible, I am well aware of that.English is actually my first language and I work as a translator as a living. The sentence structure of this story is extremely hard to adapt to English without major rewrites (which the author has asked to keep to a minimum) So I cannot just rewrite the whole story for you.You are free to go machine translate at any point in time.I am translating for money! This one is what angered me the most. Yes I have bonus chapters available, alongside my regular releases. So far I have released 5 chapters in 4 days, with around 9 hours of work and my donations were $27 total. My fee for this as a business document would be around $110 per chapter and that is not including the unique terminology and naming which needs to be done because of the genre which would make me charge more.I live in London, England. I have a well paid job and no reason to translate this other than to benefit all of you, I can happily stop at any point. The amount of hate messages I have received are not welcome, if you have a problem, I am sure you can dedicate the next 2 years of your life to learning a new language.*Rant over*I hope you all enjoy this chapter, I decided to release an extra chapter, even with the shocking amount of hate messages, one even mailed directly to my email address.Please can you reblog/post this everywhere possible. I cannot post on reddit yet so someone please link this for me.Have a great day xo xo\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 - Life or Death arenaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLooking at Lin Feng as if he was an unreachable hero, Han Man grinned: \u201cwe\u2019re like brothers. You killed Jing Feng. We would not have had the conviction to act. We will all share the responsibility for it. People may call me many things, but no one has ever called me a coward.\u201dHe had easily grasped the real reason why Lin Feng had killed Jing Feng. He had done everything with his own hands as he didn\u2019t want to get them involved in any future trouble. Han Man felt true admiration for Lin Feng. Lin Feng\u2019s heart was true and his kind actions made his pure intentions easily seen through.\u201cExactly, if there are consequences then we can share the burden together. Besides, Yun Hai sect\u2019s disciples are not permitted to kill each other, so we are safe within the sect. Even if Jing Hao was suspicious that we had killed Jing Feng, he could not retaliate \u201d Qing Yi determined.\u201cDo not forget about me, I am also with Lin Feng until the end\u201d said Jing Yun blushing. Her smile was particularly beautiful at this moment.\u201cAlright\u201d said Lin Feng happy to have made such good friends. Qing Yi was right, even though the Yun Hai sect didn\u2019t mind things happening outside of the sect, they had still imposed strict restrictions within the sect in order to stop anyone causing any problems.Lin Feng crouched down and started searching Jing Feng\u2019s body looking for the things he had been carrying. He took out a book: it was a skill book.\u201cRoaring Thunder: Sword Skill.\u201dLin Feng opened the skill book while whispering the name of the skill. Roaring Thunder was a yellow level skill. If the skill was mastered to perfection, each hit would look like a lightning strike followed by an explosive roar of thunder. The roar would travel in the trajectory of the sword with tremendous destructive power.\u201cRoaring Thunder is a sword skill from the Xing Chen Pavilion. Jing Feng\u2019s two brothers had recommended this to practice. It is a powerful skill but is particularly hard to learn and master to the point where you can always make roars of thunder appear.\u201d\u201cI also practiced that skill but I failed to grasp its concept. My power when using it is limited\u201d explained Qing Yi. Qing Yi was training to become a sword Cultivator, therefore he had read many of the sword skill books previously.Lin Feng simply nodded. He had only been practicing three skills: Nine Heavy Waves as both an offensive and a defensive technique, the indispensable movement technique Moonlight Feather Agility and Sword Unsheathing which enabled him to swiftly strike with monstrous killing power. If he practiced Roaring Thunder, he could combine it harmoniously with Nine Heavy Waves and at the same time achieve a new power which could possibly overcome the Sword Unsheathing skill.\u201cAre we going back now?\u201d Jing Yun asked Lin Feng. These days, they all considered Lin Feng as the leader of the group.\u201cSince we\u2019re already here, why hurry back? Wouldn\u2019t it be better to look for more ferocious beasts to hunt?\u201d said Lin Feng who didn\u2019t want to go back to the sect early. In the Black Wind Mountain, he could get battle experience and practice the Roaring Thunder skill at the same time. Wasn\u2019t it much better this way?The others didn\u2019t have anything to fear by staying. Lin Feng was there with them, provided they didn\u2019t run into extremely strong ferocious beasts, they wouldn\u2019t be in any danger especially now that Lin Feng had shown his true power. There was no need to hurry back to the sect.\u201cIf we could get some profound pills in exchange for the materials we have collected, that\u2019d be good\u201d said Jing Yun looking forward to harvesting more ferocious beasts. A profound pill was a pill which helped improve a Cultivators\u2019 training and enabled them to reach higher Qi layers. It was an extremely useful item for Cultivators. However, it required killing lots of ferocious beasts in order to get a single profound pill. Items which were tradable for a profound pill could only be found in higher level ferocious beasts making it extremely dangerous.Lin Feng\u2019s eyes were shining. He remembered how useful a single profound pill could be to lower level disciples. Even though he was able to defeat level eight ferocious beasts with little effort, he was still at the seventh Qi layer which was still only an average level within the disciples. If he could reach the next Qi layer, he maybe wouldn\u2019t have to rely on the Sword Unsheathing skill anymore and would be able to defeat a Cultivator who had already reached the ninth Qi layer.Five days later, in the middle of the thick and dense forest, powerful roars were heard from Ling Feng\u2019s sword. Small explosive sounds were crackling in the air all around. The sounds produced by the sword still made Jing Yun jump from fright.\u201cBOOM, BOOM\u2026..\u201d Trees were splintering and bursting apart from contact with the thunderous roars. Lin Feng was using his sword so gracefully and elegantly that it seemed like the sword was dancing in the air. You would not be able to tell from a glance that his sword held such a terrifying power.\u201cBeing able to use the Roaring Thunder skill like this after five days, he really is a monster\u201d said Qing Yi while making a wry smile and observing from a safe distance. He had also practiced sword skills and had already practiced the Roaring Thunder Sword skill. He knew how difficult it was to use. Lin Feng had been practicing for five days and every single hit produced a loud explosive sound. That was an astonishing achievement. Qing Yi\u2019s heart was feeling heavy watching this.\u201cDon\u2019t compare yourself with Lin Feng. He is using a clouded leopard as part of his training\u2026\u201d said Han Man with both hands crossed over his chest while looking at the fight between Lin Feng and the clouded leopard. What made Lin Feng so terrifying is that he could have killed the ferocious beast at any time, but instead was using it for training. He was so quick at using the sword that it seemed like an invisible wall appeared in front of him, blocking anything which approached. Even if the clouded leopard was extremely quick, there was no way it could match Lin Feng\u2019s speed.\u201cHAAAA!\u201d shouted Lin Feng cheerfully while stabbing the clouded leopard in the head causing its head to rumble then violently explode into pieces.Lin Feng sheathed his sword with a smile. He was extremely satisfied with the Roaring Thunder skill. The skill had reached a level now where it made the roaring sound with each strike. If Lin Feng managed to perfectly master the skill, it would be even stronger than Nine Heavy Waves. Its biggest advantage was that it was an attack of pure oppressive force.Lin Feng\u2019s face looked delicate and his facial features gave a handsome yet gentle feeling. In comparison with what he looked like in his previous life, he looked more refined.Han Man started picking up the precious items from the corpse of the leopard while mumbling that his original intention was to come to improve his own skills, hunt and kill some ferocious beasts, but now he was just collecting the precious items Lin Feng had left behind. He was not unhappy though as he was benefitting a lot from watching Lin Feng fight against level seven and eight ferocious beasts.\u201cHan Man, how many profound pills can we get in exchange of the materials we collected from the beasts?\u201d Lin Feng asked.\u201cThirteen at least.\u201d Said Han Man whose eyes were filled with excitement. They hadn\u2019t imagined that they would collect so many items. That was all thanks to Lin Feng. If Lin Feng hadn\u2019t been there, then it would have been difficult to kill level seven ferocious beasts.\u201cVery good, we can each have 3 profound pills. We can exchange the other materials for useful items or weapon. Now, we can go back to the sect and enjoy our hard work.\u201dProfound pellets were a very efficient way to increase a person\u2019s power on the path of Cultivation. Pills were most effective the first three times, after each pill the Qi within the body would begin to show resistance. The first pill would cause the body to overflow with Qi and the probability to reach the next Qi layer would be extremely high. Each following pill the effect would greatly decrease and after the third the pill effects would be minimal.\u201cThree profound pills.\u201d Han Man and the others were all extremely happy. There were many pills to choose from and they would have the opportunity to cultivate to the eighth Qi layer with the help of pills. Within the Yun Hai sect, the lowest Cultivators are at the fifth Qi layer. Disciples who had reached the seventh Qi layer were also considered average. Only those who had reached the eighth Qi layer received the full benefits from the sect.During those days with Lin Feng they had started to understand his personality and how he acted. He was determined on his path of Cultivation and had an incredible god-like aura which radiated from him at all times.\u201cLet\u2019s go back\u201d said Lin Feng.The first thing they did after returning to the sect was go and exchange their precious items for twelve profound pills which each of them were given three. Lin Feng also exchanged some extra materials for a long sword. Han Man got himself a new axe. Qing Yi exchanged items for two earth profound pills which would strengthen one\u2019s basics on the foundation of Cultivation. Qing Yi was finally aware that the foundation of his Cultivation was not strong enough.What Jing Yun exchanged with her items somewhat surprised Lin Feng: beauty pills. These profound pills were used to make a woman more attractive and beautiful. If an evil woman used beauty pills, they would not have a great effect as it would reflect the nature of their Qi essence. Jing Yun however was a very pure and innocent girl and it would have an increased effect on her beauty. Lin Feng didn\u2019t understand why she had chosen beauty pills as she was already incredibly beautiful to him.\u201cWhy are you looking at me that way?\u201d Jing Yun asked Lin Feng who could not stop staring at her. She couldn\u2019t help but blush and look away.\u201cNothing, it\u2019s just that you\u2019re already very beautiful. I do not feel you should change in any way\u201d Said Lin Feng who suddenly looked very embarrassed before starting to laugh awkwardly. Since Jing Yun had chosen the beauty pill, who was he to intervene.\u201cLin Feng, do you plan to go back?\u201d Han Man asked Lin Feng. He was thinking that if they had the opportunity, Lin Feng and he could go back to Black Wind Mountain together and collect even more materials.\u201cLet\u2019s practice and improve our skills first. I think being at the seventh Qi layer is still too low within the sect\u201d said Lin Feng. It was indeed only enough to be considered average by others.\u201cIndeed, we all need to improve our skills as Cultivators. Lin Feng, considering your current strength, you can go anywhere to practice. I don\u2019t think anyone would stop you\u201d Said Han Man shaking his head. He then recommended a distant place where there was an immense canyon. It was Yun Han sect\u2019s most famous place: Stormy Gorge.The Yun Hai sect was surrounded by eight extremely high mountain peaks. In the middle of the Yun Hai sect\u2019s mountain peaks was the Stormy Gorge which had a deepest point of a few hundred meters. It covered extremely vast area and was divided into several areas like an underground city. The gorge was vast and many different landscapes could be seen within. If you entered it, maybe you\u2019d end up in the middle of a forest or possibly a desert oasis.Provided they didn\u2019t enter the gorge looking for people to fight, no matter what their level, the Yun Hai sect would encourage its disciples to go and gather near death experiences. Only the strongest of disciples would enter the Stormy Gorge. Being weak and still entering would just lead to certain death.Therefore Yun Hai sect\u2019s disciples who hadn\u2019t at least reached the eighth Qi layer wouldn\u2019t dare go to the Stormy Gorge.Besides, there was another place deep inside the Stormy Gorge called the Life or Death arena. Provided a disciple voluntarily set a foot into the Life or Death arena, they could fight to the death over a grudge and if they accidently got killed, the Yun Hai sect would not get involved. While direct killing was not allowed here, once beaten within an inch of their life it was near impossible to return safely. Some people would even secretly kill wounded disciples as they attempted to return to the sect. If you had enough power, you could even publicly kill another disciple and the sect would turn a blind eye.The people who would enter the Life or Death arena had their family members or best friends killed and were unable to live without getting revenge.\u201cOf course I will go\u201d said Lin Feng looking towards the area where the Stormy Gorge was located. Observing a crowd of people on the horizon heading towards the gorge, his expression changed greatly as he remembered the past.If it had been when Lin Feng had only reached the fifth Qi layer and people still could call him a piece of trash, he would have had no choice but to watch the fighting in the Stormy Gorge from a distance while avoiding all other disciples.This is of course how he was tricked.Friday is here!!!

    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 - RevengePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySpecial Thanks to Gary R, Dean L and Hiram P.T for sponsoring this chapter.Three days after returning, Lin Feng was sitting in his room meditating. He could sense the vital Qi of heaven and earth much more clearly. A thin mist had appeared in the air of his room emanating a faint multicolored glow.Floating near Lin Feng\u2019s body was the illusory dark spirit and it seemed to be absorbing the essence of the universe and combining itself with the universe\u2019s power. If Lin Feng had been able to see his spirit then he would have noticed that his dark spirit had become more defined and was taking on the shape of a human figure.At that moment, the vital Qi of heaven and earth surrounding Lin Feng suddenly penetrated and flooded his whole body rushing towards his dantian. His eyes opened completely shocked at what had occurred because an abnormal essence had penetrated into him and was circulating within his body. The vital Qi which had invaded his body had caused him to break through to the eighth Qi layer.\u201cI ate the three Profound Pills and finally reached the eighth Qi layer.\u201d Lin Feng thought to himself with a smile. He was initially at the seventh Qi layer but was not close to reaching an advancement anytime soon. There was still a large distance to cover on the path of Cultivation to reach the eighth Qi layer. Three Profound Pills was the price for him to reach the next level, but it was worth it.\u201cNow if I battled with a Cultivator of the ninth Qi layer, I should be able to come up with a way to defeat them.\u201d When he was still at the seventh Qi layer, his Nine Heavy Waves had the energy of 8500 jin and Roaring Thunder could reach a destructive energy of 9000 jin. However against Cultivators who had reached the ninth Qi layer he would have had no chance and could at most delay his own death. Now he could confidently engage in a battle with them knowing if he didn\u2019t win he could at least escape to fight again another day.With a deep breath and after patting down his robe, Lin Feng left his room. It was a beautiful autumn day and the sun was shining brightly above him. He had a pleasant feeling of warmness all around.\u201cLowly trash, you finally made up your mind to die and crawled out from under your rock.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s good mood was ruined by the voice he heard.\u201cLin Heng.\u201d Lin Feng said while looking to his side. He saw Lin Heng ten meters away from him with arms folded, arrogantly showing Lin Feng his back without fear.As a rule, Yun Hai sect\u2019s disciples were not allowed to force their way into other disciples\u2019 rooms. Many disciples preferred to cultivate in their room and being disturbed by others could have serious consequences on their cultivation. Therefore Lin Heng hadn\u2019t dared break the sect\u2019s rules to disturb Lin Feng in his room and he had been waiting outside for two days.Turning around, Lin Heng stared coldly at Lin Feng. Lin Heng\u2019s eyes revealed his murderous intentions. It had been three days since Lin Heng had received a letter from his parents in which they said that Lin Feng, the piece of trash had injured his little brother Lin Yun. They also said he had humiliated and insulted his father and little brother during the meeting of elders. Lin Heng had been planning a way to once again trick Lin Feng.\u201cPiece of trash, I heard that nearly dying gave you a small boost in strength. With your little power would you dare come to the Stormy Gorge and help me settle my grudge by killing you?\u201d said Lin Heng in a mocking tone.Lin Fen\u2019s face was calm but inside he had a cold smile on his face. Last time he had been tricked by Lin Heng into going to the Stormy Gorge, he had been beaten to the brink of death. He hadn\u2019t killed him though because the Yun Hai sect had a rule which stipulated fellow disciples who entered the Life or Death arena were not allowed to directly kill each other. Many disciples would leave opponents with only an inch of life remaining. Many would die on their way to receive medical treatment and the lucky ones would not die but be maimed for life.He had already killed the Lin Feng of this world using that method. At that time Lin Feng was nothing but trash who was only at the fifth Qi layer, compared to Lin Heng who had reached the eighth Qi layer, who would have cared even if he outright killed the trash?The strong were the ones who dictated the rules here. The strong killed the weak, this was the law of this world. Any rule could be broken with enough strength, but the law of the world remained the same.\u201cMy time for revenge has come so quickly, this must be fate\u201d thought Lin Feng while smiling indifferently. Lin Heng had killed Lin Feng\u2019s in the past. Lin Feng was going to avenge his previous self.Lin Feng started walking towards the Life or Death arena.\u201cTrash, Coward, you don\u2019t dare?\u201d said Lin Heng sarcastically seeing that Lin Feng was ignoring him.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say we\u2019re going to the Stormy Gorge?\u201d said Lin Feng apathetically leaving Lin Heng stupefied. A small and cruel smile appeared on Lin Heng\u2019s mouth. A piece of trash was always just a piece of trash. He barely survived with his luck and is stupid enough to fight me again? This time he would not give Lin Feng even a small chance to survive. Even though he wasn\u2019t going to kill Lin Feng in the Stormy Gorge, he would wait for him to come out injured and kill him in secret before he could receive medical treatment.In order to go to the Stormy Gorge, one had to travel down numerous steep cliffs. At the entrance to Stormy Gorge were Iron chains hanging down the cliff face. If a Cultivator was not strong enough to jump down then he would use the chains to climb down.Considering Lin Feng\u2019s abilities he was able to jump down the cliff but he wasn\u2019t going to show his skills because if Lin Heng saw, Lin Heng would notice how strong Lin Feng was and would run away like a scared dog. He did not want to miss this rare opportunity and grabbed the iron chains to climb down.\u201cTrash will always be trash. You still need help to enter the Stormy Gorge.\u201d said Lin Heng with a mocking smile. Lin Heng looked down and jumped, soaring through the air like a roc. His movement skills made him so light that it seemed he could fly. As he was about to land, with a flip he smashed his feet deep into the earth beneath and came to an immediate halt.\u201cIncredible, who was that?\u201d said the people who had just seen Lin Heng land. They couldn\u2019t help but gasp in admiration.\u201cI know him, it\u2019s Lin Heng who has reached the eighth Qi layer. He\u2019s extremely strong\u201d said another disciple.Cultivators\u2019 vision and sense of hearing would become extremely developed as they transformed with each new level. Those disciples could see Lin Heng even though they were a hundred meters above the gorge looking in.They had finally arrived at the Life or Death arena. There was no grass or trees, only a sand covered landscape with large rocks piercing the surface of the sand like small mountains. Some Yun Hai sect\u2019s disciples were passing by and couldn\u2019t help but stop and watch when they saw Lin Heng and Lin Feng. They wanted to see a fight which could be the end of another cultivator.\u201cHehe, I really wouldn\u2019t have thought that a piece of trash like you would dare come. Last time you nearly died, but today I will make sure you return in a coffin.\u201d said Lin Heng while laughing. His laugh was flippant and impudent. Lin Heng wanted to come to the Stormy Gorge and kill Lin Feng, but he never thought Lin Feng would agree a second time.\u201cYou can always try if you have the ability\u201d said Lin Feng who felt saying anymore would be wasted breath.\u201cA piece of trash like you dares say some insane things just because you defeated my little brother Lin Yun. I will show you today that a Cultivator who has reached the eighth Qi layer has a strength which makes him capable of anything. Lin Feng, you are the same piece of trash as before.\u201dLin Heng was moving towards Lin Feng while shouting these words. He tried to give Lin Feng a simple punch to the face. One punch would be enough to finish this battle, the beating would come after.Lin Feng lifted his hand to stop the punch with his palm.Lin Heng couldn\u2019t help but laugh coldly. That piece of trash had suddenly used the palm of his hand to stop his punch. Was that even possible?\u201cLet me break your hand!\u201d A brilliant white light from Lin Heng\u2019s hand and was pouring out of Lin Heng\u2019s fist. He wanted to use his fist to crush Lin Feng\u2019s palm beyond repair.\u201cDream on!\u201d said Lin Feng calmly. A shockingly powerful strength came out of his palm. At that moment Lin Heng had the impression he was standing before an ocean of boundless powerful waves. The waves were overwhelmingly oppressive and violent. Not only had Lin Heng lost all his strength and arrogance, but at the same time the waves were crashing down onto his arms. His right hand had already started to swell and turn purple from the pressure.\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d said Lin Heng confused. He had the feeling that his hand was being crushed by a powerful invisible force. His entire body was being crushed and the extreme power of the waves was still increasing. He needed to escape quickly.\u201cYou think you can run with your tail between your legs?\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s face was ice-cold. The palm of his hand closely pressed against Lin Heng\u2019s fist. He was following Lin Heng not allowing even the slightest increase in distance between them.\u201cCRACK\u201dA loud spine chilling sound could be heard all around. Lin Heng felt an incomparable pain in his entire arm as if his bones were cracking and would explode at any moment. He wanted to pull his arm away but he couldn\u2019t, he wanted to run away but he couldn\u2019t, Lin Feng was overpowering him in both strength and speed. The gap between them was so great, this was simply a slaughter.They were so close to each other that Lin Heng could see every detail of Lin Feng\u2019s face clearly. Lin Feng eyes were cold and a wicked grin was painted across his face. Lin Heng suddenly felt his knees go weak with fear, was Lin Feng only toying with him?When had that piece of trash surpassed him? Lin Heng just wanted to give up and run away.\u201cHow should I finish this?\u201d said Lin Feng while laughing a bone chilling laugh. Lin Feng\u2019s Nine Heavy Waves technique was crashing out violently, and Lin Heng was being crushed by the waves of which the power reached 9500 jin. It felt like his entire arm was being crushed by a giant python.\u201cCRUNCH\u201dBlood sprayed out of his mouth as he hit the floor. A violent pain spread throughout his forearm and he could not bear such unimaginable pain. His bones had cracked and the muscles were torn beyond repair.\u201cYou\u2019re my uncle\u2019s third son\u2026 you\u2019re my cousin\u2026 but your side of the family and Lin Ba Dao act secretly together to carry out such despicable deeds. You know nothing of love and affection, insulting and humiliating me over and over again. You even came here to murder me a second time. You are pitiless and heartless so don\u2019t blame me for being merciless and cruel.\u201dLin Feng was looking at Lin Heng on the ground as he said these very cold words. If someone wanted take Lin Feng\u2019s life, his philosophy would be \u201ca tooth for a tooth\u201d no matter who the person was.\u201cNo. I am your cousin, please spare me.\u201d Lin Heng could feel Lin Feng\u2019s ruthlessness all over his body. At that moment he could clearly feel the killing intent directed towards him. Lin Heng was terrified.\u201cWhen you tried to kill me, did we stop being cousins? \u201c. Lin Feng said sharply then bombarded Lin Heng\u2019s dantian with the Nine Heavy Waves technique. Suddenly Lin Heng gave a blood-curdling screech as his face became pale.\u201cI have crippled your cultivation. Now you can live your life being called \u2018trash\u2019, like you always did to me.\u201dLin Feng said coldly then turned around and left. Not far away some Cultivators who had reached the eighth Qi layer saw how ruthless Lin Feng had been in that battle. Lin Feng did not approach them, but they each hid away to avoid conflict. If they angered Lin Feng would he also cripple their cultivation? They did not wish to find out, as a life with crippled cultivation was a life filled with suffering and agony.\u201cLin Feng you dared to cripple my cultivation. You will not get away with this\u201d said Lin Heng maliciously while burning with rage. He was furious as he had become a piece of trash himself. He hated Lin Feng\u2019s father from the bottom of his heart. He regretted the whole situation but he didn\u2019t want to wait for his revenge. He would immediately seek help from his cousin, a girl called Lin Qian who had already reached the Ling Qi layer and her spirit had awoken. In the Hao Yue sect, she had already been recognized as a powerful disciple. Lin Qian knew that Lin Feng\u2019s father had hurt her father Lin Ba Dao during their last meeting. Lin Qian had already prepared to come to the Yun Hai sect to kill Lin Feng herself.What a pity that he had tried to kill Lin Feng himself. Lin Heng hated everything. He hated himself for having failed and he hated the future he would have with a crippled cultivation.He would make sure Lin Feng suffered a fate much worse than his own.It was slightly delayed as I had accidently translated chapter 12 instead of 11 and did not realise my mistake until editing. So I wasted over an hour of my time but at least the next chapter only needs me to edit and proofread. It will either be the next sponsored chapter or my regular release on Monday. I was hoping it would have been sponsored already so I could say I was psychic and not stupid ???? heheTomorrow will also be a slave day which is a possible 5 sponsored chapters. I will not be doing anything tomorrow so I can either translate or watch a scream the TV series marathon. I may even surprise you, if I can motivate myself to translate. I find it easier to keep translating once I start, but actually starting is the problem.I am Goddess Procrastination!I hope you all enjoyed this. I think it is a very satisfying chapter and I know you will all love what comes next. I am updating the index slightly. Take a look if you want xo xo\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12 - Lin Feng\u2019s spiritPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySpecial Thanks to Anonymoose &amp; Gary R for this sponsored chapter. I am going to start work on the next 3 chapters ahead of schedule in case of sponsored chapters today or during the week. Trouble is on the horizon in the next chapters so I have a feeling I will need to be prepared to release extra when the action starts.In the city of Yangzhou was the Lin\u2019s family house. Lin Hai was sitting alone in one of the rooms longingly staring at a portrait on the wall.It was the portrait of an extremely beautiful woman. Her eyes were a deep blue like a calm ocean. Shockingly there was a ferocious beast which was wrapped around her shoulders. It looked like a snake but that was not the impression it would give, it held its head high looking down at everything as if an ancient god looking down at the insignificant creatures below. Its eyes from this portrait alone would burn deeply into your soul and leave a lasting impression.\u201cMeng He it looks like little Lin Feng has finally become an adult. I see more of you inside him every day and he even inherited your spirit. Maybe he doesn\u2019t know what this spirit means but by the time his spirit awakens, He will see how great a gift his mother has given him\u201d\u201cThe day will come when that useless snake spirit will shake the world. Our son was never trash, he always had the potential for true greatness hidden inside of him\u201d.Lin Hai standing in front of the portrait murmured to himself with an expression full of love and also a strange sadness.\u201cThey all think that I have lost my memory, but I could never forget you in my lifetime. When Lin Feng\u2019s spirit awakens, I will tell him everything. Soon he will enter the empire and follow his destined path.\u201dLin Hai\u2019s eyes showed a strong emotion welling up inside him. He once had doubts that his son would ever be able to awaken the spirit. His son was not ordinary and now he could finally see him unlocking the potential which lay hidden inside his body. Lin Hai was convinced Lin Feng\u2019s spirit would awaken shortly.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Lin Feng naturally didn\u2019t know the secret hidden by his parents. He had no memories of his mother. Lin Hai had never told Lin Feng anything about his snake spirit.Lin Feng had crippled Lin Heng\u2019s cultivation which made him feel relieved as if a weight in his heart had been lifted. It meant that the last of old Lin Feng\u2019s regrets before his death had vanished. He had finally gotten his revenge.Lin Feng wasn\u2019t going to leave immediately when he could practice and gain some more experience in the Stormy Gorge. Every person that came into the Stormy Gorge did it with the sole purpose of fighting to become stronger. Even if he didn\u2019t take the initiative to go and provoke others, he was convinced others would come to fight him.\u201cIt\u2019s you\u201d said a cold and detached voice. Lin Feng looked around looking for the voice and saw a beautiful female body; every curve seemed to be imprinted in his memories. Even though he couldn\u2019t see the face, the silhouette was enchanting.Lin Feng had some doubts as the girl was wearing a mask to hide her identity. He didn\u2019t know many people in the Yun Hai sect. He knew Han Man, Qing Yi as well as Jing Yun. That person obviously couldn\u2019t be any of them, could it be someone he knew as the old Lin Feng? Lin Feng was confused.\u201cLast time we met you ran away at such speed that even I couldn\u2019t follow. Shall we test how good your escape skills are now we are out in the open with nowhere to run?\u201d said the girl in front of him laughing coldly. The girl took an arrow from her quiver and grabbed the bow which was strapped on her back. Lin Feng immediately knew why he had recognized her. He remembered everything, she was Liu Fei, the girl from the hot spring in the mountains. Lin Feng firmly remembered her name because Liu Fei\u2019s arrow filled with killing intent had nearly ended his life on their last encounter.She was not going to give him a chance to escape, she knew he was hiding his power before so she immediately used her spirit. Lin Feng could feel that her spirit was targeting him and he was slowly being locked as its target.\u201cThe bow is the weapon of choice for long range fighters however the bow has no ability in close quarters combat. If I close the distance between us it will be harder for her weapon to show its true potential.\u201d thought Lin Feng. He had absolutely no hesitation and dashed towards Liu Fei with a shocking speed.\u201cYou really want to face me in close combat?\u201d said Liu Fei laughing sarcastically. She pulled the arrow and in an instant it shot from the bow. The arrow created an incredible pressure accompanied with a hissing sound. The bowstring was still shaking with a buzzing sound.\u201cClangggg!\u201d Lin Feng unsheathed the sword from his back.Nine Heavy Waves! Roaring Thunder!\u201d Nine Heavy Waves was pouring out from Lin Feng\u2019s left hand and shooting outwards. The power of the arrow weakened with each wave that it collided with. Then as the combined power of Nine Heavy Waves and Roaring Thunder struck, the arrow lifelessly cracked in two and fell onto the ground.\u201cMoonlight Feather Agility!\u201dHis body didn\u2019t stop for even a fraction of a second. He kept moving closer while using his Nine Heavy Waves technique to disrupt the air around him. His Moonlight Feather Agility technique was extremely smooth as if he had already used it a million times before.Liu Fei did not only have a beautiful face but she also had a powerful combat strength. She was the eighth on the list of disciple rankings.She knew Lin Feng wanted to close the distance so she had jumped back immediately after having shot her arrow. She was an expert at fighting with a bow and she had clearly learnt some excellent movement skills. By the time Lin Feng had broken the first arrow into two, her hand was already charging her bow with tremendous amounts of Qi, but this time\u2026 with three arrows knocked in place.\u201cGoodbye.\u201d Said Lin Feng who was running at an incredible speed. He then suddenly changed destination and jumped towards a small grove of trees. Liu Fei\u2019s movement technique was extremely profound. Lin Feng\u2019s technique however was only a hair better than Liu Fei\u2019s technique. Even though he could get close it required time, during this short time it was enough for Liu Fei to shoot a few arrows. She had just attempted to shoot three arrows at once and with three arrows shot from her bow, Lin Feng could feel the immediate threat to his life.Which is why the moment Lin Feng saw that she was putting three arrows into her bow, he had quickly changed his plan and decided to escape from sight. That was the best way to hinder Liu Fei\u2019s fighting strategy. Also when fighting on an open area the distance between them was vast however in this grove of trees she would need a line of sight to target him. Liu Fei using her arrow spirit was definitely able to bring out her maximum fighting potential on an open plain.\u201cLooks like I have underestimated the power of a Cultivator who has reached the ninth Qi layer, it\u2019s not that easy to fight against and win\u201d Lin Feng thought feeling gloomy. He hadn\u2019t known that Liu Fei had reached the ninth Qi layer which was the highest Qi layer before advancement. She was already able to control her arrow spirit and her bow harmoniously using her Qi. Her long-range power was a nightmarish. His previous thoughts of fighting with ninth Qi layer disciples and easily winning were immediately extinguished.But Lin Feng didn\u2019t get discouraged. He was convinced that if he managed to make Liu Fei enter the grove of trees then the victory would be his.\u201cHumph!\u201d laughed Liu Fei ironically behind him. She started pulling on the bowstring which emitted a powerful pressure as it was pulled back farther and farther.An intense and dreadful sensation spread throughout his body. Lin Feng understood Liu Fei was about to shoot and his body was warning him of the danger. Lin Feng held his sword tightly in his hand. He needed only two breaths to reach the grove of trees and he would be safe.\u201cWhere are you running!\u201d said Liu Fei in a slightly panicked tone.A sword had suddenly come into vision which shocked Lin Feng. He could sense that he was in great danger. He was dashing forward with all his strength when suddenly he stopped and then jumped back.\u201cBOOM!\u201d broken earth flew all around. There was an explosion in front of Lin Feng and an extremely deep sword mark had appeared leaving a crater in the ground. If Lin Feng had continued to walk towards the grove and been even a second late then that sword would have cut Lin Feng\u2019s body apart.Lin Feng\u2019s expression changed as he saw a man in the grove that was wearing white robes and holding a long sword in his hand. A moment ago it had been his sword which had created the mark in the ground.\u201cLiu Fei, how has that bug offended you? Do you want me to help you kill this bug?\u201d the disciple standing in the grove was disdainfully looking at Lin Feng and appeared to be someone who thought very highly of themselves. In his eyes, Lin Feng was an ant and he would kill him without hesitation, Liu Fei just had to nod and give him the signal to act. He would kill Lin Feng immediately if she asked him to do so. Even if the sect prohibited killing fellow disciples directly, there would be no reason for them to punish him because he had a high status above those bugs making him untouchable.\u201cOne of the sect\u2019s Elite disciples\u201d Lin Feng saw the badge on the man\u2019s clothes. Lin Feng was trembling with fear and felt like time itself had frozen. If Liu Fei asked him to attack Lin Feng then he would do it. Lin Feng would need to dodge at his highest speed or he would be beheaded immediately.\u201cYu Hao, Stop interfering with other peoples business.\u201d Liu Fei said but she hadn\u2019t shot her arrow. It is not that she was showing mercy to Lin Feng or had forgiven him, it was only because Yu Hao was courting her but she had absolutely no interest in him. So she hadn\u2019t asked him for help, because she didn\u2019t want to owe anything to Yu Hao and using this moment to kill Lin Feng would indebt her to Yu Hao.She recalled her spirit back into her body and put her bow back onto her back. She said to Lin Feng: \u201cConsider yourself lucky this time, next time the best thing you can do is not to run into me, otherwise you will not be as lucky as today.\u201dWhen she finished talking, she turned around and walked into the distance.\u201cLiu Fei, why do you always leave immediately?\u201d said Yu Hao shaking his head then immediately shot into the distance, not even giving a look at Lin Feng.\u201cBOOM!\u201d another explosion sound rung out in front of Lin Feng and a very deep sword mark was left in the ground.\u201cConsider yourself a lucky bug, next time I see you provoking Liu Fei, I will have to crush you\u201d said Yu Hao whose voice came from a distant place.Lin Feng was still standing in the same place, not moving in the slightest. Even though the sword had caused an explosion of power in front of him, he for some reason was not scared.Liu Fei thought she was extremely strong and because Lin Feng dared to come into the hot spring where she trains to provoke her, she wanted to kill him. Yu Hao was an elite disciple and his strength was extremely powerful. He had no reason or malice towards Lin Feng, but was also about to kill him without speaking a word to him. Lin Feng had been in this world for a short time but Lin Feng had understood and learnt from experience in what it meant to be strong: to be respected; to be ruthless.\u201cYu Hao, when I reach the Ling Qi layer, you will look into this bug\u2019s eyes as I take the sword from your hand and then drive it into your heart.\u201dLin Feng saw the extremely deep marks left by the sword in the ground and a ray of light flashed through his mind, right after he turned around and left the place. He was convinced that someday his hard work and innate gifts would make him strong enough to take his revenge and he believed that day would not be far away.I hope you all enjoyed this.

    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 - Battle in the Life or Death Arena (Part 1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLin Feng didn\u2019t continue his training in the Stormy Gorge. Instead he decided to leave the gorge and was once again standing at the top of the cliff looking down upon the gorge.Looking down into the gorge he could see it was a boundless canyon as far as the eye could see. There were thousands of people inside training. It was a place filled with endless battles and cultivation. That was the Yun Hai sect\u2019s culture which bred the strongest cultivators. Here you would be beaten to within an inch of life and forced to climb back to the sect with your broken body. Only the strong will thrive here and the weak will be the fertilizer for the strong to grow.Lin Feng walked around the canyon outside the Stormy Gorge and to his surprise came across some of his friends. He was happy to see Han Man and Jing Yun again so quickly.\u201cLin Feng\u201d shouted Jing Yun. She couldn\u2019t hold in her excitement meeting Lin Feng again.\u201cJing Yun, how is it possible that you are even more beautiful than the last time I saw you\u201d said Lin Feng complimenting her while smiling sheepishly.In comparison with a few days before, Jing Yun really had become even more beautiful and pure. Lin Feng knew it was because of the beauty pills, but he never would have thought it would have such a great effect.Jing Yun blushed when she heard Lin Feng and couldn\u2019t help but look away. She said in a soft voice: \u201cWhy are you bringing that up?\u201d\u201cHaha, Lin Feng you have to be less bold, Jing Yun is still very shy.\u201d said Han Man straightforward as always. \u201cLin Feng, we were initially getting prepared to come and look for you and never thought we would bump into you so soon\u201d.\u201cCome look for me? why? what\u2019s going on?\u201d asked Lin Feng.\u201cLin Feng, did you reach the eighth Qi layer when you ate your share of Profound Pills?\u201d Han Man was looking forward to seeing Lin Feng as he had killed a Hell Wolf when he was still at the seventh Qi layer, he was surely going to be even more shockingly powerful after having reached the eighth Qi Layer. \u201cYes, I had a breakthrough recently. How about you guys?\u201d said Lin Feng while smiling.\u201cIf an ignorant fool like me could reach the eighth Qi Layer so quickly, obviously a monstrous talent like you would have.\u201d said Han Man while grinning: \u201cJing Yun hasn\u2019t reached it yet as she needs some more time before she can advance to the next level. Qing Yi hasn\u2019t come out yet either but he should be at the bottleneck for advancement.\u201dLin Feng nodded. Even though Han Man had a carefree behavior, he cultivated a little bit more efficiently than Jing Yun and Qing Yi so it was normal for him to be the first one to reach the eighth Qi layer.\u201cHan Man, you still haven\u2019t told me why you were looking for me.\u201dHan Man scratched his head and felt slightly embarrassed which left Lin Feng speechless. \u201cLin Feng, I have also reached the eighth Qi layer. I want to go to the Stormy Gorge and test my strength but I may get massacred by cruel Cultivators. I wanted to ask you to accompany me and only if we encounter a strong and merciless disciple will you need to get involved. I am a guy who can endure a beating or two.\u201dHan Man was grinning while asking Lin Feng for his help. Lin Feng directly understood what Han Man meant and would only need to get involved if a life was on the line. He of course wouldn\u2019t refuse the request of such a good friend.\u201cWhen do you want to go?\u201cTomorrow we can head out. I want to prepare some masks first.\u201d Han Man saw that Lin Feng didn\u2019t hesitate at all when he gave his answer. He felt even more admiration for Lin Feng as he was a true friend. Not only was this guy abnormally strong but he also had no arrogance at all. He didn\u2019t argue about anything and always kept things fair between them. He was the one who had killed almost all the ferocious beasts back in the Black Wind Mountain, yet he had insisted to share the items equally with everyone involved.\u201cNo problem. Just give me a shout when you\u2019re ready to go\u201d said Lin Feng straightforwardly.People who enter the gorge all chose to wear a mask which Lin Feng originally did not know. The reason many chose to enter was in order to fight other disciples. Losing was a disgrace and winning could cause a blood feud. Wearing a mask was a way to overcome all of these issues.\u201cI also want to come, Lin Feng can stay by my side at all times and protect me. I know I will be safe with him by my side\u201d said Jing Yun in a charming yet innocent voice. Lin Feng was stupefied. Both Han Man and Lin Feng were staring at Jing Yun wide eyed. Was this really the shy girl from before?\u201cWhy are you two looking at me like that?\u201d said Jing Yun glancing at them and stamping softly on the ground.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, don\u2019t worry\u201d said Lin Feng smiling and continuing as if nothing had happened.Lin Feng and Han Man thought it was strange to see her so bold while still acting like a cute and innocent child. Han Man was looking at Jing Yun confused at the change he had seen. He had been really dumbfounded to hear Jing Yun say she wanted Lin Feng to protect her. How fearless was she to be so direct.\u201cAlright you can come with us too. We should be discreet and not go looking for trouble.\u201d said Lin Feng quickly analyzing the situation before agreeing. There were many extremely talented Cultivators down in the gorge and to some extent it was frequented by Elite disciples. Elite disciples were all relatively proud and aloof. They would refrain from attacking ordinary disciples without being provoked. So with Lin Feng\u2019s help, they were convinced that they could go down in the gorge without getting into too much trouble. Elite disciples could kill other disciples without repercussions from the sect. They had the power to do as they pleased.Lin Feng had the bad luck of accidentally coming across both a ranked disciple who wanted to hunt him down and a pompous Elite disciple. His luck really was terrible.After having all the details confirmed they all departed in different directions. Lin Feng went back to his room and continued to cultivate without stopping to sleep. Seeing how weak he was compared to others, had strengthened his willpower and he felt a flame ignite in his body as if it was screaming for him to be the strongest.The morning after Han Man had come to pick up Lin Feng and they both immediately left to go and meet Jing Yun.The Yun Hai sect was extremely large. The ordinary disciples\u2019 rooms covered several districts and this area was the size of a small town.Lin Feng and Han Man arrived to the place where they had agreed to meet with Jing Yun. They saw that Jing Yun\u2019s face was pale and worried. There was a young boy standing in front of her talking with an evil look on his face.\u201cJing Yun, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Lin Feng asked while approaching at an increased speed.\u201cGet lost, you piece of trash! Can\u2019t you see that I\u2019m talking to Jing Yun? What makes you think you have the right to interrupt me?\u201d said the young boy to Lin Feng while narrowing his eyes. He knew Lin Feng in the past and would often join in bullying him.\u201cLin Feng, you are finally here!\u201d said Jing Yun to Lin Feng smiling at him and ignoring the young disciple\u2019s remark.\u201cShall we go?\u201d said Lin Feng mockingly while not even looking at the young boy. Han Man, Lin Feng and Jing Yun all turned to leave without even glancing back at the young disciple.\u201cWait, wait, Han Man, Jing Yun\u201d said the young boy while grabbing Jing Yun\u2019s sleeve to stop her from leaving.\u201cGet lost. Can\u2019t you see we have something to do? What makes you think you have the right to interrupt me?\u201d Lin Feng said, throwing the young disciples words back at him while knocking his hand away from Jing Yun.Powerful waves shot from Lin Feng\u2019s palm directly towards the young disciple. The power contained in this small action had caused the young boy who was at the seventh Qi layer to crash into the floor several meters away and spit out a mouthful of fresh blood. He looked at Lin Feng gasping with astonishment.\u201cGet lost, you piece of trash!\u201d said Lin Feng which shocked as it was a slap in the face. Lin Feng didn\u2019t stop in the slightest and continued to walk away. When had the piece of trash, Lin Feng, become so fierce?\u201cThat disciple sure acts rashly, Jing Yun, who is he?\u201d asked Han Man to Jing Yun.Jing Yun\u2019s face got tense when she heard the question. She looked at Lin Feng and Han Man and said: \u201cHe was saying that he saw the beheaded body of Jing Feng in the Black Wind Mountain and it was clear that it had been done by a sword technique. Jing Feng\u2019s big brother, Jing Hao is now searching for those who were with Jing Feng. He had come to threaten me with this information.\u201dHan Man was stupefied. No wonder Jing Yun had lost all color from her face.\u201cIf he comes, then he comes. Let fate take its course and do not worry about the small problems.\u201d said Lin Feng who was remarkably calm.\u201cConsidering that he is not an Elite disciple within the sect, he would not dare attack us while within the sect\u2019s territory. We have to be a little bit more careful in the Stormy Gorge to avoid unnecessary conflicts.\u201d said Han Man while nodding in agreement with Lin Feng.It did not take long for the group of three to arrive at the Stormy Gorge. Lin Feng had arrived in much less time than when he was hiding his power, he was actually shocked at his own speed.Inside the Gorge they had spotted a Fortress made of solid compact earth. That earth fortress was covering a huge area. It looked like dozens of ordinary people could live in there with ample room. Even though it was made of earth there was no doubt that it was completely sturdy. It looked like even a strong raging storm would cause no damage to this fortress. In the Stormy Gorge it was common for a disciple to create a dwelling, but this one was unique.Han Man touched the fortress. There was no dust from deterioration and no sticky feeling from the earth absorbing the rain. They really had no idea how such a fortress had been built.At that moment a silhouette emerged from the earth fortress. It was a person who was also wearing a mask and was cautiously exiting his dwelling. The person glanced at Lin Feng and the two others momentarily then in a panic left at full speed which stupefied everyone present.Lin Feng and the others understood what had happened. They all looked at each other and smiled. People in the Stormy Gorge were not weak and had all reached the seventh or eighth Qi layer as a minimum, some had reached levels even higher. There were many different skills practiced by thousands of disciples in this gorge and it would be common to find previously un-encountered skills. Under those circumstances, who would not retreat when encountering a group of three people who suddenly approached?Did those three people come together with cruel intentions towards the disciple who was alone? This kind of thing was not rare in the Stormy Gorge.\u201cIt looks like we have to separate or we will scare many people away.\u201d said Lin Feng while smiling and moving away. The most important thing was for Han Man to gain experience in combat. Lin Feng just had to stay back and make sure there were no unexpected dangers.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14 - Battle in the Life or Death Arena (Part 2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayToday\u2019s sponsored dosage is brought to you by Gary R. Special thanks to him for supporting my work and all of your reading addictions xoxoIt\u2019s currently quite late here. I woke up to get a glass of water and saw this so decided to give you an earlier release. My second proofread may not be perfect as I have just done it half asleep sat here in my PJs..My toes are freezing!Enjoy! Thank you all for supporting this series xo xoJing Yun continued to stay close to Lin Feng\u2019s side. She was only at the seventh Qi layer and was too weak for her to be left alone. The seventh Qi layer was the lowest level in the Stormy Gorge so that wasn\u2019t adequate for her to go out and battle other disciples.Han Man understood Lin Feng\u2019s intentions by leaving him alone. If Lin Feng was constantly at his side protecting him then he wouldn\u2019t be able to fight and gain experience at all. It was crucial for him to rely on his own strength from this point onward.Walking alone in the Stormy Gorge did not require much time before someone approached him. He could see the person\u2019s eyes through the mask which revealed a clear intention to fight.There was no time for an exchange of words. The disciple immediately charged into Han Man while raising his fist emanating a powerful Qi.\u201cHow unlucky, Han Man has run into a Cultivator of the ninth Qi layer.\u201d said Lin Feng while smiling and observing from a distance. Han Man had already guessed his opponent\u2019s level from the powerful Qi that he was releasing from his fist. He had no time to worry about the difference in strength; he concentrated the Qi of his entire body into his fist and then released all the strength he had in one strike while giving a loud and powerful shout.The power of this punch had made Han Man step back a few meters while his opponent hadn\u2019t moved a single inch. It was as if his fist had struck against an iron wall and it was obvious from a single exchange which of them was stronger.\u201cEighth Qi layer\u2026 You\u2019re so weak. I thought I could gain some experience. How disappointing, I\u2019m leaving.\u201d said the opponent in an apathetic tone. He then turned around and started leaving.He had lost interest in Han Man. Many Cultivators found joy and pleasure in being cruel and merciless. However those who were serious towards the path of Cultivation found no pleasure in acting cruel without provocation and would be more focused towards strengthening themselves. Those disciples found satisfaction in fighting opponents of a similar level and to some degree fighting opponents even stronger than themselves would help them gain insight. This was a way for them to really challenge themselves and unlock their potential while getting much needed battle experience.\u201cWait, wait!\u201d Han Man shouted.He had come to the Stormy Gorge for the first time today, how could he accept being defeated that quickly? He immediately released the power of his spirit. A yellowish brown light started floating around his entire body as if he was in symbiosis with the Earth beneath his feet and his Qi energy began to grow in strength.\u201cEarth spirit\u201d said the opponent showing a sudden interest and right after said: \u201cYour spirit is not bad, let me see if you can take my three profound punches.\u201dAfter the opponent finished his sentence, he took a single leap and appeared in front of Han Man.\u201cBOOM\u201dThe yellowish brown color which was surrounding Han Man suddenly emitted an extremely radiant light as dust filled the air around them. Han Man was propelled six steps backwards while blood started oozing from the corner of his mouth.Seeing the opponent ready to leave once again.\u201cCome back\u201d said Han Man while wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth. His bravery could reach the heavens as he continued to stand firm, his fighting spirit was soaring. The yellowish brown light surrounding his body was shining brighter and brighter as if he was draining all the power from the very land itself.\u201cKABOOM\u201dHan Man was propelled eight steps backwards while his opponent was propelled three steps backwards.\u201cDelightful!\u201d said his opponent. His fist started glowing with a white light and then he warned Han Man: \u201cBe careful, I\u2019m going to use one of my strongest skills on this punch.\u201d\u201cAlright\u201d replied Han Man while starting to charge towards his opponent. Each of his steps was making the ground violently shake, like a powerful war horse galloping at full speed towards battle.\u201cUse the strength that you have borrowed from the Earth\u201d shouted Lin Feng while watching from a distance, completely captivated by the battle. He wouldn\u2019t have thought that Han Man would understand how to use his spirit in such a unique way. Combining the power of his Earth Spirit and the earth beneath his feet could greatly increase his strength.\u201cBOOM!\u201d their two fists collided. A cloud of dust shot in all directions from the shock wave between Han Man and his opponent, making it impossible to see what had happened. When the cloud of dust had vanished, Han Man was sitting on the ground meditating.\u201cYou unexpectedly understood what that other disciple said. Well done.\u201d said his opponent while smiling and getting up from the ground. He also had blood coming from the corner of his mouth. He hadn\u2019t expected Han Man\u2019s last attack to be so powerful. He had been slightly injured but it was worth it for him. He had gained valuable insights thanks to this fight.He didn\u2019t spend more time with Han Man and immediately vanished into the distance.\u201cWhat an interesting guy\u201d said Lin Feng while moving towards Han Man. He felt a degree of respect for the disciple Han Man had just battled with. \u201cHe was an honorable fellow.\u201dLin Feng and Jing Yun obviously knew that Han Man had learnt more about his spirit and gained an insight into his cultivation path. They didn\u2019t want to disturb him so they sat next to him and waited for him to finish gaining his insight.That fight had enlightened Han Man. What had just happened was a rare moment of divine enlightenment. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if Han Man\u2019s strength started increasing at lightning speeds once he fully understood his new insight. Lin Feng and Jing Yun admired him. He had entered the Stormy Gorge and had a flash of realization right after his first battle.A short while after, Han Man\u2019s body suddenly started emitting a strong Qi stupefying Lin Feng and Jing Yun who looked at each other gasping with astonishment.\u201cThe strength is so powerful and unique that it gives a deep and oppressing feeling. Is this really the power of enlightenment?\u201d thought Lin Feng.The path of Cultivation was a vast and there were many different routes to take within cultivation. Lin Feng had only just started walking on the path of Cultivation. He couldn\u2019t imagine how powerful some Cultivators were and he knew that these strong cultivators could destroy mountains or crush entire cities in their way with ease.It\u2019s said that Cultivators upon reaching the level of immortals can fly into the heavens and penetrate into the depths of the Earth. These cultivators would have an unlimited lifespan and could move at speeds faster than light. Lin Feng could only envy, as such power could only be imagined by someone like him who had never experienced it. He wondered if he would ever be able to fly into the heavens and look down upon the world.While Lin Feng was lost thought, someone in the distance was coming towards them at incredible speed. When he saw Han Man who had just made a huge step on the path of Cultivation, he laughed mockingly.\u201cWake up\u201d said an ear-splitting voice making the atmosphere vibrate and shocking Lin Feng and the others into awareness.\u201cWaah\u201d shouted Han Man, who spat out a mouthful of blood and started breathing heavily.His eyes turned red in anger as he was staring at the distant silhouette. He had the feeling he was beginning to understand the concept of his new strength but when he heard the voice it had interrupted his breakthrough. Besides, the deafening voice had shaken his defenseless body so much that he was spitting out blood.\u201cHow insolent\u201d said Lin Feng with eyes filled with killing intent. He was staring at the silhouette in the horizon. That person had intentionally addressed Han Man and interrupted his flash of enlightenment causing damage to Han Man\u2019s body.Han Man walked towards the silhouette and asked furiously: \u201cWhy did you interrupt me?!\u201d\u201cNo reason, I just did it for fun.\u201d The person was not wearing a mask and had a teasing smile on their face. None of them had seen this disciple before or heard of someone so mischievous.\u201cYou did this for fun?!\u201d said Han Man while walking forwards, rage spreading throughout his body. He understood how rare the flash of enlightenment was but that person had voluntarily interrupted him in that very important moment and on top of that, he had injured him.\u201cHehe you want to fight? But it\u2019s not so fun to fight here in the gorge, if you want to have your revenge, why don\u2019t you come to the Life or Death Arena?\u201d asked the young person in a disdainful tone showing hatred for Han Man.\u201cAlright.\u201d replied Han Man without hesitation trying to control his extreme anger.\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you\u201d said the young person while leaving in the direction of the Life or Death arena.\u201c\u201dHan Man, it is hard to determine his strength in comparison with yours and going to the Life or Death Arena is very dangerous.\u201d Lin Feng warned Han Man.\u201cI\u2019m able to determine his strength with just a glance. He is the same as me: eighth Qi layer.\u201d replied Han Man which surprised Lin Feng. Was Han Man able to sense other people\u2019s Cultivation level?\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but I\u2019m also able to sense Jing Yun\u2019s Cultivation level as well as yours. It\u2019s maybe one of the effects of the flash of realization I just had. Maybe I could explain if I was not interrupted.\u201d Han Man\u2019s explanation didn\u2019t convince Lin Feng. Han Man started walking towards the Life or Death Arena while clenching his fists.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Lin Feng was really skeptical. Jing Yun and Lin Feng followed Han Man putting their trust in their friend\u2019s words. If Han Man\u2019s flash of realization really enabled him to sense other people\u2019s Cultivation level and the opponent was really a Cultivator of the eighth Qi layer then there shouldn\u2019t be a great danger if they are evenly matched.The Life or Death Arena was located in a canyon at the middle of the Stormy Gorge. There were ten seats for viewing above the rocky terrain on the boundary of the arena, but as the area was extremely vast, many would gather around and watch the battles from a distance.Two silhouettes entered the Life or Death Arena which promptly drew the attention of the cultivators in the area. In a flash, many people were rushing over to watch the fight.Even though the amount of people who come into the gorge was huge, there are very few people who ever enter the arena. After all inside the Life or Death Arena you had to risk your life. If you didn\u2019t hate someone with all your heart then why take those risks? Most people who would go into the arena would do it to fight against an opponent of similar strength which made the battles interesting to watch.Therefore when Han Man and his opponent came to the Life or Death Arena, the amount of people surrounding the area was enormous. In the Stormy Gorge there were some people who watched this area waiting for a bloody battle and would spread the news to fellow disciples at incredible speed.\u201cWe all come to the Life or Death Arena to settle our grudges. My goal is not to settle any grudge, because today your fate has already been decided by someone else.\u201d said the young boy to Han Man while a creepy smile covered his face: \u201cHan Man, remember the name of the one who is going to take your life, my name is: Jiang Huai\u201dLin Feng standing on the sand dunes outside the arena felt a shiver run down his spine. When he heard what Jiang Huai said, he knew something was wrong. How did he know that it was Han Man behind the mask?\u201cYou know me?\u201d said Han Man furious.\u201cHehe.\u201d a sinister smile crept over Jiang Huai\u2019s face. A burning energy suddenly started emerging from his body accompanied by blazing flames. At the same time an illusory flame appeared on his back: A fire spirit.\u201cHe is indeed a Cultivator of the eighth Qi layer\u201d said Lin Feng feeling the energy coming down from the Arena.Han Man\u2019s earth spirit similarly started to burst out. He started running forwards. Even though he wasn\u2019t running very fast, the energy and the strength released by his body made every footstep send small quakes through the floor.\u201cFlame Detonation\u201d a powerful wave filled with flames shot towards Han Man. When Jiang Huai saw that Han Man had abruptly stopped and taken a posture which made him look like an unmovable mountain, Jiang Huai shouted: \u201cI will smash this mountain before me! Ha ha ha\u201d.Their two fists collided and both Han Man and Jiang Huai suddenly stopped moving, exactly where they had just collided. Neither of them overpowering their opponent.Jiang Huai frowned and stopped laughing. He hadn\u2019t expected Han Man to be that strong. A malicious grin appeared on his face and he thrust out with his left fist but Han Man easily blocked it with his palm. Suddenly he threw a white dust from his right hand directly into Han Man\u2019s eyes. He carried this dust to blind enemies stronger than him.\u201cDie!\u201d said Jiang Huai while throwing a punch at Han Man\u2019s chest.\u201cDamn! How shameless.\u201d cursed Lin Feng who then saw shadowy figures moving towards the life or death arena\u201cIn the Life or Death arena people sometimes lose their life. Do not worry it will be your turn soon Jing Yun\u201d said the shadow in a chilling tone. Jing Yun was terrified when she saw his face.\u201cJing Hao.\u201dShe shouted loudly. She saw the other disciple behind Jing Hao, it was the young disciple who had been injured by Lin Feng earlier that day and now everything had been made clear. This was all a trap to begin with.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 - Battle in the Life or Death arena (part 3)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThank you to Joseph G for this sponsored chapter. xoxo\u201cBOOM!\u201d \u201cHa ha ha\u201dJiang Huai circled around and attacked the defenseless Han Man from behind. He didn\u2019t intend to let him get even the smallest chance to rest. He punched Han Man repeatedly as the powder had blinded him. The sound of Han Man\u2019s bones cracking and a loud spine chilling shriek filled the air. However this was drowned out by the laughing of Jiang Huai who was taking joy in every last moment of Han Man\u2019s suffering.\u201cThat guy really is shameless. He must have planned to use that powder from the start. How despicable!\u201d There were more and more people gathering around the Life or Death arena. Some of them were talking to other disciples all had their eyes fixated on the fight.\u201cIn The Life or Death Arena there is no rules on fighting fairly, you can resort to whichever method needed to win.\u201d said Jing Hao.Nonetheless, Lin Feng acted as if he hadn\u2019t heard that remark and moved towards the arena, suddenly Jing Hao blocked the way, there would be no saving Han Man as his punishment was to be beaten to death in front of everyone.\u201cLet me pass.\u201d Said Lin Feng.\u201cEighth Qi layer and you still dare to come and challenge me. I am avenging my dead brother Jing Feng this has nothing to do with you, unless you want to get involved in my personal grudge?\u201d threatened Jing Hao not really paying much attention Lin Feng.\u201cGet Involved? You do not want me, the person who killed your brother to get involved? I beheaded him as he begged for the mercy he would not have shown others. Now let Han Man come down off the stage and let me replace him. If I don\u2019t go into the Life or Death arena willingly, how will you be able to avenge your pathetic little brother?\u201d Lin Feng said.Jing Hao was sixth in the disciple rankings. Lin Feng had monstrous talent but could he be compared to those in the top rankings, it was not possible. Han Man had a face filled with protest when he heard what Lin Feng had said, but his voice was too weak to protest.\u201cHuh?\u201d Jing Hao\u2019s couldn\u2019t believe what he had heard and slowly wrath filled his eyes. He quickly shouted: \u201cJiang Huai, stop attacking.\u201dWhen Jiang Huai heard Jing Hao, he stopped fighting immediately and stood looking at Jing Hao waiting for his next order.\u201cYou can come over and replace Han Man if you dare\u201d Jing Hao said pointing at Lin Feng with murderous intentions in his eyes.He didn\u2019t need to speak such useless words. Lin Feng jumped into the arena in a flash. He could see that Han Man\u2019s face was drenched with blood and his body was mangled. Bones could be seen piercing out from his skin, many fingers were not in the correct position and his breathing was heavy with a wheeze. Lin Feng wiped the blood covering Han Man\u2019s eyes as at this point he could not move his arms, he was barely breathing. This reminded Lin Feng of how he had been left here before in the same condition.\u201cHan Man, can you make it out of the arena alone?\u201d Lin Feng asked Han Man.\u201cNo problem. I am not dead. Please just go and avenge me.\u201d said Han Man grinning, enduring the intense pain all over his body.\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s felt a pain in his chest when he saw Han Man\u2019s smile. That guy was really stubborn, it was clear he did not have the strength to go alone.He helped Han Man stand up and using Lin Feng as a crutch to lean upon, started moving to the edge of the arena. Lin Feng stopped upon hearing Jing Hao\u2019s voice: \u201cJiang Huai, you know what to do.\u201d\u201cI understand, I have to kill them both.\u201d replied Jiang Huai.Jing Hao, who was satisfied with the answer, nodded in agreement.\u201cIn the Life or Death Arena, you are not the ones who get to decide your own life or even your friend\u2019s life. You want to replace him? No problem, you will die first instead of him and then he will die.\u201d Jing Hao said carefree while watching Lin Feng who had continued moving Han Man to the edge of the arena.\u201cIs that so?\u201d said Lin Feng with a grin covering his face, letting Han Man rest on the edge of the arena.At that moment, Jiang Huai was charging towards them surrounded by a powerful fire Qi.\u201cFire Bomb! Die together!\u201d shouted Jing Huai. A ball made of flame suddenly appeared in his hand, emitting a strong scorching heat which seemed to overwhelm the very air itself.\u201cGet lost!\u201d said Lin Feng while unsheathing his long sword. A roar of thunder spread throughout the entire arena. Immediately the flames were enveloped by the thunderous roars, but the sword didn\u2019t decrease its momentum and shot towards Jiang Huai who was still running forward, leaving a small hole in his chest where the sword had pierced directly through him.\u201cSplash, splash\u2026\u201d drops of blood were falling from the wound in Jiang Huai\u2019s chest. Lin Feng was looking at Jiang Huai with powerful killing intent.\u201cI\u2019m going to die?\u201d said Lin Feng while laughing. He thrust out his sword again. There were roars of thunder all around. Jiang Huai tried to run and avoid the attack but it was too sudden for him to react. He was hit by the shockwave of the sword which made his body fly up into the air before heavily falling back down onto the stone floor.Jiang Huai couldn\u2019t avoid a single hit. Every time he got to his feet he was sent flying into the air and crashed heavily onto the rocks beneath.\u201cRoaring Thunder skill\u2026 the thunderous roars that come from his sword\u2026 he\u2019s able to use the Roaring Thunder skill and create a thunderous roar each strike! Which genius of our sect is that?\u201d people in the crowd couldn\u2019t hold back their excitement but they couldn\u2019t recognize Lin Feng as he was wearing a mask. If they could, many would pinch themselves to wake from the illusion.Jing Hao was seized with horror. His faced looked hideous as he had been humiliated. Jiang Huai surprisingly couldn\u2019t fight Lin Feng, killing him seemed to be an impossible mission. Jiang Huai could only attempt to escape and run to Jing Hao, who would protect him.Jiang Huai saw Lin Feng\u2019s long sword getting closer. He was lying on his stomach, seemingly unable to get to his feet, but he didn\u2019t stop crawling in the opposite direction of Lin Feng unconsciously. His face was filled with terror and despair.\u201cI\u2019m not fighting anymore, I give up, you have won!\u201d\u201cI have won?\u201d Lin Feng looked like he had heard the best joke in the world. Jiang Huai had nearly killed Han Man. If Jiang Huai had been strong enough then he would have killed Lin Feng and Han Man, but now he was declaring himself defeated. Admitting defeat, was that really enough after everything he had done?\u201cDIE!\u201d shouted Jiang Huai suddenly. A white powder flew towards Lin Feng. Meanwhile, Jiang Huai pounced towards the edge of the arena. Luckily Lin Feng had not let his guard down even for a second.\u201cJing Hao, protect me, quickly.\u201d said Jiang Huai while dashing in Jing Hao\u2019s direction. Lin Feng was following behind him like a shadow.Something heavy had fallen onto the ground outside of the arena boundary with a \u2018THUMP\u2019. It was actually Jiang Huai\u2019s body which had fallen down from the rocky arena platform onto the ground beneath but he was smiling because he had landed in front of Jing Hao and even more importantly, outside of the arena.Jing Hao couldn\u2019t come in the arena to intervene as fights in the Life or Death arena were duels; if he had intervened he would lose face. However after having moved to the boundary area, there was no restriction with him taking action here.\u201cToo bad you didn\u2019t kill me in the Life or Death arena.\u201d said Jiang Huai while looking mockingly at Lin Feng who was still on the edge of Life or Death arena. The Life or Death arena was a battle arena where one\u2019s life was at stake. Jiang Huai had stepped out of the arena. If Jiang Huai was still in the Stormy Gorge, Lin Feng could still chase and secretly kill him but because Jing Hao was there, he wouldn\u2019t act rashly.\u201cIs that so? When he has stepped out of the Life or Death arena, his life will no longer be in my hands but in the hands of the gods. Killing him is against the rules?\u201dAfter saying this Lin Feng created powerful waves using his Nine Heavy Waves technique and shot them in Jing Hao\u2019s direction.Jing Hao had a malicious smile on his face. The Nine Heavy Waves smashed into his palm not even leaving a mark.\u201cRoaring Thunder.\u201dLin Feng threw himself towards Jing Hao brandishing his sword using his Roaring Thunder skill.Jing Hao unsheathed his sword and replied using the same Roaring Thunder skill.\u201cNine Heavy Waves, Go Die!\u201d after finishing his Roaring Thunder skill, Lin Feng jumped into the air like a tiger and his Nine Heavy Waves shot out which didn\u2019t completely stop Jing Hao\u2019s Roaring Thunder but had weakened it and the Waves continued to flow like an endless ocean.Jing Hao looked surprised as he hadn\u2019t expected Lin Feng\u2019s skills to be this powerful. Lin Feng would take advantage of every opening and use his Roaring Thunder skill. Each of Lin Feng\u2019s strikes were aimed at Jing Hao\u2019s vital points. With each shock wave which was stopped another would follow, flooding the gorge with its shockwaves. Each time there was no other choice but for Jing Hao to step back and retreat.By the time he had neutralized all of Lin Feng\u2019s attacks, he had realized his mistake. Lin Feng was standing next to Jiang Huai. Lin Feng\u2019s long sword was pointed towards Jiang Huai\u2019s neck.\u201cWhen combining Nine Heavy Waves and Roaring Thunder it created a powerful combination which even forced Jing Hao to step back. Even though it was only a few steps, he can still be proud of himself.\u201d\u201cJing Hao is sixth on the disciple rankings. His strength is above average. He has even perfected his Roaring Thunder skill. I would have never thought that guy would master the Roaring Thunder technique on equal terms with Brother Jing Hao and would even force him to take a step back.\u201dPeople in the crowd were discussing loudly. Lin Feng was only at the eighth Qi layer. Jing Hao was one of stronger disciples of the sect and even some disciples of the ninth Qi layer wouldn\u2019t even be able to defeat him even if they fought him together. But Lin Feng was able to make Jing Hao step back and had Jiang Huai\u2019s life in his hands. Who could have imagined this turn of events?Hearing all the people commenting on the fight, Jing Hao couldn\u2019t stop himself from getting angry. He was very famous amongst the disciples of the sect. Because of Lin Feng he had lost face and been humiliated.\u201cHow dare you! Go on! I dare you to kill him! I will make your life a nightmare, such a nightmare that you will want to die every day.\u201d Jing Hao was shouting at Lin Feng who was holding his sword over Jiang Huai.\u201cPlease let me go\u201d begged Jiang Huai who was shaking,\u201cLet you go? In your dreams. You can die like a dog here.\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s sword flashed and slit Jiang Huai\u2019s jugular.The scene was incredibly shocking. Jiang Huai laid there wide eyed watching the scene of his own death. A constant stream of blood sprayed from the wound, rising in the air then falling into the sand. Blood mist was thick in the air and all around was dark red sand.\u201cHave Courage!\u201d said members of the crowd pitying Lin Feng\u2019s fate. Jing Hao had a spine chilling sensation watching the scene unfold in front of him. Lin Feng had surprisingly ignored what he had said, ignored the clan rules and directly killed Jiang Huai in such a brutal way. Lin Feng had completely disregarded Jing Hao\u2019s warning.No matter what, Jing Hao would never stop hunting Lin Feng, so why would he care about idle threats?\u201cYou managed to humiliate me today and even if I cannot kill you now, I will make you suffer a fate worse than death\u201d said Jing Hao furiously.The entire crowd thought Lin Feng was very unlucky. He had made Jing Hao furious and had broken the clan rules. Even if Lin Feng didn\u2019t die, he was about to be tortured to the point of wanting death and that would only be the beginning. Lin Feng was a skillful disciple but against one of the top ten disciples within the ordinary disciple rankings, nobody thought he was strong enough to resist.Jing Yun was so nervous that she could hardly breathe. Unfortunately she was a weak Cultivator and she couldn\u2019t help Lin Feng. Jing Hao could kill her in one strike from his sword.Everyone was looking at Lin Feng. Lin Feng remained silent. He turned around slowly and jumped back into the Life or Death arena.\u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d asked people in the crowd while looking at Lin Feng who was already back in the arena. They were all stupefied.Lin Feng arrived in the middle of the arena; he turned around and then looked at Jing Hao. In an icy cold tone, Lin Feng said: \u201cWhat are you waiting for? You\u2019re next.\u201dAt that moment a complete silence covered the gorge. Lin Feng had challenged the sixth ranking disciple in the life or death arena.I did warn you guys that things would get interesting! I hope you enjoy all the cliffhangers hehe xoxoGood disciples don\u2019t break sect rules! Bad Lin Feng!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 - The way of the worldPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLin Feng was wearing a mask so nobody could recognize him, even though he wouldn\u2019t be recognized by the top disciples who populated gorge. He had mastered the Nine Heavy Waves technique as well as the Roaring Thunder skill which proved he was a monstrous talent and would definitely draw attention.Jing Hao was the sixth strongest disciple within the sect ranking system and was above Lin Feng in cultivation at the ninth Qi layer. Jing Hao had made his name famous by defeating three disciples who were also at the ninth Qi layer in a three-on-one battle.Lin Feng\u2019s level of cultivation was a whole layer below Jing Hao, but everybody had seen Lin Feng force Jing Hao to retreat. He had killed Jiang Huai who was one of Jing Hao\u2019s closest followers. Jing Hao had lost face, he had allowed an unknown disciple who was only at the eighth Qi Layer to force him into retreating and even watched as his follower was killed in front of his eyes. At the moment when everyone was expecting Jing Hao to unleash his fury and force Lin Feng into a pitiful state, Lin Feng had already stepped back into the Life or Death Arena. While everyone staring disbelievingly at his action, Lin Feng wasted no time and challenged Jing Hao in the most condescending way.\u201cMaybe, he knows that his fate is already sealed and has chosen to die in battle\u201d said a disciple in the crowd. Lin Feng was only at the eighth Qi layer after all and his strength was relatively low in comparison with Jing Hao.Jing Hao felt humiliated and didn\u2019t know how such a turn of events had come about. He had never been humiliated in such a way since he had joined the Yun Hai Sect.\u201cSince you are requesting to die, who better than me to kill you.\u201d said Jing Hao full of hatred. Since he had seen Lin Feng use the Roaring Thunder skill, he knew that Lin Feng hadn\u2019t lied to him, he definitely had the strength to kill Jing Feng.Not only had he killed his little brother but he had also humiliated him in front of a large crowd of disciples. This could not be tolerated.Jing Hao stepped into the arena as a strong force began to rise from his sword. Behind Jing Hao was a floating illusionary sword pointing towards the heavens. It was Jing Hao\u2019s sword spirit.\u201cJing Hao was wasting no time and immediately started using his sword spirit. He wants to show Lin Feng the gap between their powers.\u201dEverybody guessed what Jing Hao intended to do. He wanted to show how powerful he was compared to the commoner in front of him.\u201cUnsheathe your sword and I will let you have three sword strikes before I attack. Let me see what your puny strength can do with three sword strikes\u201d said Jing Hao while holding his sword and arrogantly looking down on Lin Feng.Lin Feng grinned. He immediately used his Moonlight Feather Agility. Like moonlight during the day, he disappeared from sight then appeared in front of Jing Hao. Many illusory swords began to form then shot from Lin Feng\u2019s hand palm directly at Jing Hao. When they arrived in front of Jing Hao, all these illusory swords combined into the tip of Lin Feng\u2019s sword and then smashed down into Jing Hao. A deafening thunderous roar spread throughout the atmosphere.\u201cHow strong. He is really a master at using the Roaring Thunder skill\u201d. When the crowd heard the noise, they looked at the scene horrified. The sounds emitted by his attacks sounded like lightening tearing through the air and then exploding on impact. These sounds could even scare the disciples watching from a distance.Jing Hao\u2019s expression which was initially extremely carefree suddenly tensed. He had underestimated his opponent and could not let his guard down.The thunderous roars made the air in the gorge start to tremble. An extremely powerful illusory sword was hovering in the air in front of Jing Hao acting as a shield.\u201cFirst attempt\u201d said Jing Hao mockingly.Lin Feng didn\u2019t lose his concentration. He believed in his power and ability. Countless thunderous roars exploded as Lin Feng prepared his second strike. This would be much more powerful than the first strike.Jing Hao was still just protecting himself and not attacking. He was using his illusory sword as a shield knowing with his higher cultivation and sword spirit, he could counter any type of attack.For his next strike Lin Feng started charging at Jing Hao, however he suddenly thrust his sword forward and loosened his grip of the hilt. The sword continued to move along its trajectory and flew through the air at Jing Hao.\u201cWhat is he doing?\u201dThe crowd was as stupefied as to what Lin Feng had just done. Lin Feng had concentrated all his Qi into the tip of the sword then shot it towards Jing Hao. If Jing Hao accepted this attack like before, then he would damage his sword spirit with the impact. This was not an option for Jing Hao.Jing Hao was stupefied for a second and then smiled to himself. Did Lin Feng really think this would work?Jing Hao started to move backwards while bringing his sword upwards in an arc and with an elegant movement he had skillfully countered the force of the sword sending it flying powerlessly into the air.After Lin Feng let go of his sword he was already charging at incredible speed towards Jing Hao. Using his Moonlight Feather Agility technique it seemed as if his feet did not touch the floor as they disappeared before anyone could clearly see them.\u201cSecond attempt.\u201d said Jing Hao arrogantly as he watched Lin Feng approach him at incredibly speed. He did not feel threatened, he was merely toying with Lin Feng. Lin Feng had landed in front of Jing Hao however his sword had landed on the floor behind him.\u201cYou really want to die?\u201d said Jing Hao while biting his tongue. Lin Feng had not stopped to collect his sword which was flying through the air. He began to strike towards Jing Hao with his fists, this way he was unable to count the third sword strike and would be humiliated by being forced to take Lin Feng\u2019s blows without ever retaliating. All he wanted was to show Lin Feng the difference in their power, but again he would be forced to lose face because of Lin Feng.Then Jing Hao heard Lin Feng say something which shocked him to the core: \u201cthat\u2019s enough. I am done playing now\u201d.Lin Feng had stopped in front of Jing Hao with eyes filled with killing intent and suddenly a thunderous roar was heard. A bright and blinding light flashed through the air between the two figures before disappearing from sight.Jing Hao looked stupefied and horrified at what had just happened. It seemed like he had understood what Ling Feng had meant. Jing Hao was not the predator in this fight and instead it was Lin Feng who was toying with him. Would the result have been different if he had not arrogantly given Lin Feng three strikes? Jing Hao no longer had the opportunity to regret his actions as he had already taken his last breath.\u201cThird attempt\u201d Said Lin Feng as his voice filled the air surrounding the arena which was deathly silent.Jing Hao was still stood in the middle of the arena unharmed but to everyone\u2019s surprise, Lin Feng had simply walked past Jing Hao and picked up his sword which was previously sent flying. The whole arena was completely silent, everyone had heard it. As Lin Feng\u2019s words echoed throughout the canyon the only other sound was of Jing Hao\u2019s body slumping down onto the floor with blood seeping from a previous unseen wound on his neck.Everybody was watching the scene stupefied and couldn\u2019t believe it their eyes. Jing Hao had lost?How had Lin Feng attacked?\u201cSword unsheathing skill.\u201d In the crowd there were many Elite disciples. They had seen the light of the sword which passed between Lin Feng and Jing Hao. Because the sword was too quick, it looked like a meteor flashing through the sky before disappearing.Suddenly everyone started to discuss the battle they had just watched. They could not believe what they had just witnessed.The sixth ranked disciple had been defeated by Lin Feng and the outcome of the battle had been his death.\u201cWho is he?\u201dEveryone was wondering which disciple had been so arrogant to directly kill two people in succession. How had he overcome Jing Hao who was ninth Qi layer and was one of the best disciples of the sect? Lin Feng had shown that he was the true genius and no one doubted his skill after this display. The news that someone had defeated Jing Hao was going to spread quickly within the Yun Hai Sect.At that moment, on the top of the gorge many people were discussing the last sword strike of Lin Feng.Not so far away from the gorge inside a bustling pavilion. A relaxed old man was staring blankly into the distance and smiling as he whispered: \u201cThat young man has already learnt how to master the Sword Unsheathing skill. He really does have incredible talent.\u201dThe old man was the one Lin Feng had met at the Xing Chen Pavilion, who had reminded Lin Feng of an extremely powerful fictional monk from his past life. That old man would have never thought he would see the sword he gifted to an interesting young disciple appear in the Life or Death Arena. That is how he had recognized Lin Feng.The Stormy Gorge was a place where many Yun Hai Sect disciples chose to go and practice the control of their cultivation and martial techniques within real battle. The top disciples of the sect, including many Elite disciples, were the disciples who populated the Stormy Gorge. You could see that the Yun Hai sect was an outstanding sect from just looking at the sheer number of its disciples in the gorge who were watching the fight from the sidelines.Except for the old man, Jing Yun and Han Man, there was only one disciple in the crowd who knew the identity of who had just killed Jing Hao. That man was called Guo Hai, the young disciple who had used Jing Feng\u2019s death as a pretext to blackmail Jing Yun. The result was that he had been beaten back by Lin Feng. Afterwards he had looked for Jing Hao and remembered what Lin Feng and the two others were wearing so he could identify the group. He had been tracking them as they went down into the gorge. This was all part of his plan as he would use Jing Hao to kill Lin Feng and Han Man then take Jing Yun as his reward.Guo Hai had watched as Lin Feng killed Jing Hao which was utterly unexpected. He was so terrified that he secretly tried to escape knowing that he would be next.\u201cYou want to leave now\u2026 but isn\u2019t it too early to leave now that you have been so successful with your trap?\u201d said Lin Feng to Guo Hai in an ice-cold tone. Lin Feng had paid careful attention and had already seen that Guo Hai had been hiding behind Jing Hao and whispering in his ear.Guo Hai stopped and had a shiver run down his spine as he felt Lin Feng\u2019s cold gaze piercing through his back.When Guo Hai heard Lin Feng, he turned around. Guo Hai was smiling but it was a smile to hide his terror which was ugly to behold.\u201cYou must be mistaken senior brother, I have nothing to do with the events which have happened here!\u201d Guo Hai said in a respectful tone, pretending he did not know it was Lin Feng.\u201cOh so want to lie and say that you do not know me?\u201d said Lin Feng smiling. His face revealed clear killing intent which he made no attempt hide.\u201cPlease remember we are in the Stormy Gorge and not in the Life or Death Arena. You cannot act rashly\u201d said Guo Hai in a shaky and fragile voice, who could feel Lin Feng approaching with the intent to kill.\u201cI know.\u201d said Lin Feng sounding indifferent.\u201cBOOM!\u201dPowerful waves suddenly crashed heavily onto Guo Hai pressing him against the ground. Guo Hai had no chance, he didn\u2019t even attempt any resistance. After Lin Feng had killed Jing Hao, would he have the strength to resist such a powerful opponent?Lin Feng grabbed Guo Hai using only one hand and threw him directly into Life or Death Arena. Lin Feng then picked up his sword and approached Guo Hai who was struggling to stand after landing so heavily onto the rocky arena.\u201cNow you are in the Life or Death Arena, so there are no problems.\u201dThe crowd looked at Lin Feng, they were speechless in shock. How audacious could one person possibly be?\u201cThis wasn\u2019t my decision, I didn\u2019t decide to step in here myself. You are violating the sect\u2019s rules by doing this. How dare you so blatantly break the sect\u2019s rules?\u201d Guo Hai hadn\u2019t expected Lin Feng to throw him into the arena. He started shaking from head to toe with fear.A light suddenly flashed between Lin Feng and Guo Hai, sending his head flying into the air.\u201cDoes the sect really have such rules? Then I will just have to ignore them\u201dLin Feng said with a hint of anger as he finally sheathed his sword.If the sect really had rules, would have Liu Fei dared take out her bow and try to kill him without discussion?If the sect really had rules, would the Elite disciples really threaten him with death without being provoked?These rules obviously do not apply to all disciples. If you are strong enough, if you master enough skills, if you have a high status within the sect, there is one rule: the rule is that there are no rules. It was as if he was daring the elders of the sect to try and punish him for killing other disciples.Lin Feng doesn\u2019t take pleasure in killing people. In Lin Feng\u2019s previous life, if you killed people then you would be sentenced to death. However in this world several people tried to kill him even though there was no grudge between them. It enabled Lin Feng to understand that in this world, only the strong would survive. It was a cruel world, therefore if people wanted to kill him, then he would mercilessly kill them. Anyone who attempted to take his life would lose their own no matter their family connections, status or gender; all would be cut down by his sword.Lin Feng went back to Han Man who was sat on the edge of the arena smiling. He said to Lin Feng: \u201cI never doubted that you would kill them\u201d\u201cRules or no rules, they were already dead.\u201d Said Lin Feng while smiling.and they all lived happily ever after.The endSlightly late on my release today as I was working late. This is Wednesday\u2019s regular release.Unfortunately there is no cliffhanger for you today. Just Lin Feng daring an extremely powerful sect to punish him. I am sure that will go down well. hehe xoxoThank you to everyone for your support! I hope you enjoy this chapter.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Special thanks to Jaskirat K &amp; Joseph G. Luckily for you all there is no cliffhanger today. I thought I would still give you the sponsored chapter on my day off since I worked late yesterday and didn\u2019t manage to finish it in time for you. This chapter was one of the harder ones.Thank you everyone for the continued support! It really means alot xoxoLin Feng and Jing Yun were in Han Man\u2019s room, they were staring at Han Man and worriedly looking at his injuries.\u201cThese injuries are very serious.\u201d said Lin Feng while checking Han Man\u2019s injuries. Although cultivators had a higher natural healing ability than other people, his injuries were very serious. It seemed like every part of his body had been damaged from his broken bones to internal injuries inflicted on his organs. It would be impossible for him to recover without any assistance.\u201cNo problem, my life has always been tough. I won\u2019t die so easily.\u201d said Han Man with an optimistic smile.\u201cWhat about your cultivation?\u201d Said Lin Feng staring at him. Han Man dodged Lin Feng\u2019s glance. He couldn\u2019t look at Lin Feng\u2019s eyes. That\u2019s right, even though he wasn\u2019t going to die, his cultivation was damaged and without proper care he would eventually turn into a cripple, with less strength than even an ordinary person.\u201cLin Feng, let\u2019s go to the Black Wind Mountain kill some ferocious beasts to get some items to exchange against Immortal Pills to heal Han Man.\u201d said Jing Yun. Han Man was just another disciple of the sect and there were a great number of disciples to replace him. If you were not an Elite disciple, the Sect would eventually only provide you with basic accommodation. If you had rendered a great service to the sect or if you had an extraordinary strength then they would make you join the Elite disciples. Those who showed rare capability on the path of Cultivation became important and respected sect members. As ordinary disciples they couldn\u2019t count on the sect\u2019s help as far as Han Man was concerned, what would be the benefit for the sect to waste such precious materials to save a normal disciple?\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t work, his injuries are too serious. Even if an ordinary pill can cure him, the side effects will be too harsh on his damaged body\u201d said Lin Feng shaking his head.\u201cWhat should we do then? Is there another solution?\u201d asked Jing Yun.Lin Feng suddenly stood up, turned around and walked towards the door.\u201cI\u2019m going to the Precipice of the Abyss. Wait for me. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d said Lin Feng calmly.Complete silence filled the room which Lin Feng had just left. Jing Yun shivered nervously clenching her fists.Han Man was smiling. Even though his face looked as if he was happily smiling you could see his eyes becoming moist.The Precipice of the Abyss\u2026Only a guy like Lin Feng could come up with such an idea\u2026Only a guy like Lin Feng would dare to go there with his cultivation\u2026The Precipice of the Abyss was one of the most mysterious and sacred places of the Yun Hai Sect. It was even more famous than the Life or Death Arena.There were not many people who engaged in battles in the Life or Death Arena but every once in a while, there would be some. However there were extremely few people who went to the Precipice of the Abyss. Those who dared to go there were those who were truly seeking either enlightenment or death. Within the Yun Hai Sect many disciples heard the name of the Precipice of the Abyss, but they had never laid eyes or heard stories from what was inside. It was too dangerous to even attempt to enter and those who did, never returned to tell the story.Everyone had heard that if you passed the test of the Precipice of the Abyss then the Sect would acknowledge you and you would receive a priceless treasure. Needless to say if you failed the test then the consequences would be disastrous.On the top of the Yun Hai Mountain, there was a mystical cave which was very difficult to reach for ordinary disciples. That cave was the passageway to the Precipice of the Abyss.At that moment, Lin Feng was at the entrance leading to the cave.\u201cI, Lin Feng of the Yun Hai Sect dare to challenge the Precipice of the Abyss!\u201d shouted Lin Feng in front of the entrance.His voice penetrated into the walls of the cave and didn\u2019t stop echoing for what seemed like an eternity. After a short time a voice replied, however this voice did not echo and seemed to arrive from inside the cave instantly.\u201cCome in.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d replied Lin Feng and immediately started walking inside the cave.The passage was dark and there would be no light to be found this deep within the cave, but it was still possible to barely make out the surroundings. On both sides of the cave there were paintings and symbols drawn on the walls. He continued walking forwards and could already see part of the cave in which there was a small light. He immediately headed towards the light.Inside this part of the cave there was a bed made of stones, a single table and chair with a candle atop. It was a very rustic room. On the bed sat an old man wearing a black cloak. His eyes were closed and he wasn\u2019t moving at all, there were not even signs of breathing. After a long time the old man spoke.\u201cYou want to go to the Precipice of the Abyss?\u201d Said the old man wearing the black cloak with his eyes still closed.\u201cYes, I do.\u201d replied Lin Feng.\u201cAnd for what reason do you want to go there?\u201d\u201cMy friend has been injured. He has broken bones and his internal organs have been heavily injured too. I need the sect\u2019s support to save him from becoming a cripple. I need pills which can cure him without the side-effects.\u201d replied Lin Feng unperturbed.The old man wearing the black cloak opened his eyes. His expression was profound as if his stare was penetrating into Lin Feng\u2019s soul; it was as if he could see through him.\u201cIf there was such an easy way to get pills then all disciples would attempt it, but you are only at the eighth Qi layer. Passing the exam of the Precipice of the Abyss will be extremely difficult\u2026 Release your spirit so that I can see it.\u201dLin Feng nodded. A small snake appeared but as the dark spirit appeared it instantly hid itself and was undetectable.\u201cWhat! Really?\u201d said the old man wearing the black cloak while frowning. Even though he had a broad knowledge, he had never thought that such a spirit existed. It seemed like the snake was flying in the air but it was thin and looked weak. It did not look like a ferocious beast and instead looked weaker than a house pet.\u201cYou can go to the Precipice of the Abyss through this passage.\u201d Said the old man pointing to one of the passage ways. In that room, there were many passageways all leading to different places all of which required taking different exams.\u201cThank you, Elder.\u201d said Lin Feng nodding. Then he entered the passage without any hesitation or regrets.When the elder saw Lin Feng enter the passage, he shook his head. Eighth Qi layer and his spirit was so incredibly weak. It was almost impossible for him to pass the exam in the Precipice of the Abyss. The passage the old man had just shown to Lin Feng led to the Precipice of Zhangu. That was the least dangerous exam and Lin Feng could come out at any time. However, its degree of difficulty was the highest of all exams.(TL: \u6218\u9f13: Zhangu: chinese war drum, I decided to go with this name for easier translation)Lin Feng had come for his friend so the elder in the black cloak didn\u2019t want Lin Feng to get injured too seriously. Therefore, he had opted to let Lin Feng enter the only place where he could forfeit and return if he thought it was too difficult.The drums hadn\u2019t emitted a sound for a hundred years which also meant nobody had been able to pass the exam of this passageway in a hundred years.Lin Feng entered the passageway. It was pitch black inside. There was countless hand carved stone steps leading down this passage. There was over a thousand steps to the top and at the end he could see a simple yet large square room. Lin Feng arrived at the room and saw a huge stone doorway which was the only entrance to the room. As Lin Feng approached, these huge stone doors began to open themselves letting Lin Feng enter.\u201cWhat a mysterious place.\u201d Whispered Lin Feng. The passage suddenly open and allowing him entry.A pure and fresh air assailed Lin Feng\u2019s nostrils. This room was enveloped in clouds and mist and there was a slight chill in the air. The room itself gave a dangerous yet mysterious aura.In the room there were eight large drums. These drums looked like the war drums from his previous world which would be played during military attacks. They looked identical to the war drums of his world.\u201cBooom.\u201d The large doors made of stone closed behind him. Lin Feng turned around and saw words written in big letters.\u201cIf only one makes the sound, doesn\u2019t that mean I have succeeded?\u201d Lin Feng had understood the meaning behind these large letters which were carved into the back of the stone doors. He then moved to the center of the area and looked around.He didn\u2019t know what made these drums so mysterious. He just had to make one drum make a sound to pass the exam.\u201cHA!\u201d Lin Feng dashed towards a drum while condensing the Qi in his fist and randomly punched the drum.\u201cDoooonnnng\u201d the drum made a muffled sound. Invisible sound waves were released from the clock drum which made Lin Feng step back in shock.\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Feng frowned. He dashed forward again and concentrated 5000 Jin of power in his fist then punched the drum directly.\u201cDooonnnnngggg\u201d a strong vibration spread throughout the atmosphere. The vibrations began to combine into a powerful wave. Once all the waves had combined into one the single remaining wave was launched directly back to Lin Feng.\u201cBoooom\u201d The powerful wave crashed onto Lin Feng which knocked him into the air and sent him flying backwards.\u201cCough, cough\u201d Lin Feng fell on the ground and coughed twice. Seeing the blood come out of his mouth stupefied him.Was that Nine Heavy Waves?Lin Feng\u2019s eyes stared blankly at the drum. He had just been attacked by the Nine Heavy Waves technique and that Nine Heavy Waves power was far greater than his own understanding. These drums were able to return attacks and duplicate the strength of the attacks they returned.How intriguing. How did these drums return my attacks?Lin Feng was sitting and thinking deeply on the current situation. The first and the second time, he had only managed to make a muffled sound like a \u201cdooong\u201d. The drums hadn\u2019t emitted anything close to a genuine drum sound on either of his strikes. To make things worse, the stronger his attacks were, the stronger they came back at him. It really was a mystery which seemed impossible to solve.\u201cI\u2019m doing something wrong. Since this is an ancient sect exam, there must be a way to pass the exam. It\u2019s just that I haven\u2019t thought about the solution yet. Moreover, the elder in the black cloak knows that I\u2019m an eight Qi Layer cultivator and that my spirit is weak. He must have chosen the easiest exam for me. If I can\u2019t pass the easiest exam then how would I ever gain support from the sect to help Han Man?\u201dLin Feng was thinking deeply then he suddenly jumped to his feet. At that moment he had perfectly understood what he was doing wrong as well as the elder\u2019s intentions. It wasn\u2019t the easiest exam, it was actually the most difficult one. The old man back in the cave actually hoped that Lin Feng would come crawling back in the face of difficulties. This was a test on how stubborn he could be in his path to becoming an immortal.\u201cDark spirit, come out\u201d thought Lin Feng. Lin Feng released his dark spirit. Immediately, his vision could pierce the secrets of the world. When he used his dark spirit, all of his abilities and skills became more powerful, including his power of understanding.His long sword emitted a metallic sound. A thunderous roar spread in throughout the atmosphere and bombarded onto a drum.\u201cPsshhhh\u201d\u201cBooom\u201dA whistling sound and a thunderous roaring filled the atmosphere of the cave. The attack struck the drum but then as before the power was reversed and duplicated. The sword shook and he tried to stop the counter attack.Lin Feng\u2019s clothes were torn apart. There was blood flowing from wounds on Lin Feng\u2019s body. This was exactly what Lin Feng had predicted. The powers of the counterattacks were exactly twice the power of his previous attacks. Even though he was trying to protect himself, it didn\u2019t work.\u201cI just have to improve my skills.\u201d said Lin Feng without retreating. He used roaring thunder again, but this time to attack another of the eight drums with his full power.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 - Emerging PowerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOver the Precipice of Zhangu, a strong wind was whistling. Sword Qi could be seen shooting in every direction. An insanely strong wind could be seen on the edge of the cliff, it was a powerful whirlwind of sword Qi.The sword Qi became thicker and more violent as you moved closer to the eight drums. Unending whistling noises as well as thunderous roars were filling the atmosphere and causing a violent wind to appear all around.Lin Feng forgot how many times he had used his roaring thunder skill to strike at the drums. The Qi released from the sword became a transparent layer around Lin Feng\u2019s body in an attempt to protect him from any attacks. The powerful sword attacks continued bombarding the drums. Lin Feng\u2019s body was covered with wounds from head to toe. Some wounds were scratches while others were so deep you could see the bone. Anyone who could see him would think he had just fought in the most terrible of battles.But it seemed like Lin Feng had forgotten everything, He was immersed in the infinite Qi of his sword and began unlocking its mysteries, defending himself, attacking, defending himself, attacking again\u2026If someone had been there looking at Lin Feng, they surely would have cried out in alarm for him to stop damaging his body. Each time he conducted an assault on a drum, he was defending himself against the counterattack. Then he would attack the drum again using Roaring Thunder. Even though the counterattacks were twice as powerful as his own attacks, he was endlessly attacking them.\u201cThere has been no sound yet.\u201d The reality sobered him up. Even though it was extremely dangerous for him to do that, he understood how much he had progressed. Before when he had been practicing the Roaring Thunder skill he had thought that he had reached the highest level possible and had complete mastery of the technique. There on the Precipice of Zhangu he understood that he didn\u2019t master the skill and had only truly understood the basics. Compared to a truly strong cultivator, his technique would be at the level of a child not long from his mother\u2019s breast.At the beginning he was using only half of his power to attack a single drum. Then as time progressed, he attacked two, then three, until he had begun attacking all eight drums. He was attacking all eight drums while receiving their counter attacks, each time he would receive a counter attack many times more powerful than his original attack. If he wasn\u2019t careful then the counterattacks could destroy a limb or crush his ribs. His sword technique had grown to a much deeper understanding.As time progressed he increased the power of his attacks and continued to train. The power of his attacks became twice as strong, then three times as strong, he continued until the power of each of his strikes was amplified in power by seven times the power of his original attacks. Every time he had thought that he had reached his limits he then would discover how to surpass that limit. He then multiplied his power by seven and attacked all eight drums at the same time. His body had become used to the pain and pressure created from constantly enduring this kind of harsh training.Unfortunately the drums were just making the same muffled noise and didn\u2019t emit the noise which would pass the exam.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026There were an innumerable amount of people gathered around the Life or Death Arena.\u201cWhat happened here? The Elders are coming.\u201d said the crowd while staring at the person in the Life or Death Arena. They felt puzzled.\u201cIt\u2019s senior disciple Chen Xing, two months ago he became the strongest ordinary disciple, because he defeated an Elite disciple in one hit and was allowed entry into the elite disciples. What is he doing here?\u201d\u201cHehe, who cares about Chen Xing? Haven\u2019t you seen Tu Fu and fellow disciple Ling Hu are here?\u201d\u201cWhat! You\u2019re saying that Tu Fu and Ling Hu are in the crowd?!\u201dThe crowd was noisy and all sorts of discussions could be heard about the reason behind these events. Tu Fu was very famous in the Yun Hai Sect. He was allegedly the strongest Elite disciple. As far as Ling Hu, the Yun Hai Sect could say it didn\u2019t have a single disciple who didn\u2019t know him as he was regarded as the strongest disciple of the sect. Ling Hu He Shan had surpassed everyone\u2019s level on the path of Cultivation within the sect, including that of some elders.How was everyone supposed to keep calm after seeing such a strong disciple at the Life or Death Arena?On the horizon the wind was growing uneasy. There was a legendary looking roc in the sky, spreading its wings and soaring toward that location, everyone could see that it was extremely powerful.\u201cIt\u2019s coming.\u201d said the people around the Life or Death Arena while looking at the silhouette flying in the sky. They were all tense.The speed of the legendary roc was extremely fast. In a flash it had already arrived within stormy gorge. The Yun Hai Sects crowd of disciples burst into an uproar again. They were giving shouts one after the other.\u201cOh my\u2026 There are people\u2026! Two people are riding the legendary roc. Can you see there is also a beautiful girl up there.\u201dPeople watching this scene could feel their hearts racing with excitement. The legendary roc was carrying people and there was even a very beautiful girl. What a mind blowing scene! It was too much for those lower disciple, they had already seen too many shocking things today.\u201cI apologize for having kept you waiting.\u201d The bird landed in the Life or Death Arena. The speed at which it had been flowing and arrived was unconceivable. The crowd saw it clearly\u2026 that roc was a spirit. Both wings were spread wide and it looked like a real roc. The roc spirit was that of a young unknown disciple, his expression was strange\u2026 he looked extremely handsome and extremely evil at the same time.\u201cHow young! He has such a strong roc spirit at his age? How did he become so strong?\u201d\u201cWait, wait. I heard that in the core disciples of the Hao Yue sect, there is a highly ranked disciple who has a roc spirit\u2026 it is even difficult to compare him to a human\u2026..\u201d\u201cAbsolutely, that core disciple enjoys a well-deserved reputation. He has amazing Agility techniques. His spirit can also carry others on a flight with its strength.\u201d said some elders of the sect. He was indeed the first disciple of the Hao Yue sect, his name was Chu Zhan Peng. A short while ago, the Yun Hai sect received a letter written by Chu Zhan Peng saying he wanted to enrich his knowledge and exchange pointers with an outstanding disciple of the Yun Hai sect. And besides he would immediately come in the Life or Death Arena, of course for a fight.Chu Zhan Peng became a core disciple in the Hao Yue sect, he was extremely famous in the Xue Yue Country because of his status. He was the sixth strongest disciple of the country. Hardly would it be an exaggeration to say that no man in the entire Yun Hai Sect could match his strength. Ling Hu He Shan wasn\u2019t going to fight Chu Zhan Peng. The sect wasn\u2019t willing to challenge him. However, if he, himself, challenged someone, the clan had no choice but to accept.\u201cDear Elders, you\u2019re flattering me. This is my female junior apprentice Lin Qian. Not long ago she had already reached the Ling Qi layer. This time I am coming because my apprentice Lin Qian heard that Yun Hai disciples are all strong and powerful, therefore she wanted to come and broaden her knowledge. I was hoping that you could help her achieve enlightenment by allowing a match of similar strength. She would learn a lot from such a battle\u201dChu Zhan Peng introduced the beautiful girl who was on his side. Chu Zhan Peng still looked both handsome and evil at the same time.Mo Xie insulted Chu Zhan Peng silently in his thoughts. Chu Zhan Peng had a certain reputation and could not be easily rejected. He had sent the letter in advance and planned some type of scheme.\u201cGo Chen Xing, you\u2019re the one appointed to battle Lin Qian. Show her our sects techniques and teach her through battle.\u201d Chen Xing had reached the Ling Qi layer two months before when he had defeated an Elite disciple. He was already at the first bottleneck of the Ling Qi layer. If he couldn\u2019t defeat Lin Qian, no other Yun Hai Ling Qi disciple would be able to defeat her.\u201cYes, Elder.\u201d said Chen Xing while nodding. He then went in the middle of the Life or Death Arena to face Lin Qian.\u201cFellow practitioner Lin Qian, let\u2019s start\u201d said Chen Xing while releasing his spirit. Suddenly a layer of rocks covered his body. This made him look like a huge golem monster made completely of the hardest rocks.\u201cThis is Chen Xing\u2019s rock spirit. Not only is this an outstanding defense ability but his attacks are also extremely powerful. He will clearly win this without needing any more skills.\u201d said an older disciple while staring at Chen Xing with confidence.Even though Chen Xing was covered with gigantic rocks, his speed hadn\u2019t decreased and he could move with incredible speed like before he was covered. In the blink of an eye, he had arrived in front of Lin Qian. He lashed his fist in the direction of the thin and frail Lin Qian which made everyone feel worried for the safety of this beauty.\u201cIce\u201d whispered Lin Qian. A freezing cold air coming from her body spread began freezing the air around her. This sudden attack froze Chen Xing\u2019s rocky hand in place which gave him the feeling he had hit an iron wall, unable to strike forward.Then Lin Qian suddenly grasped Chen Xing\u2019s fist using her both hands. Ice spread on Chen Xing\u2019s arm and then violently spread until it covered his entire body.\u201cThat ice spirit is so powerful, she really does have natural talent!\u201d Mo Xie said. Everybody was born with a spirit, but the same spirit in different people didn\u2019t have the same strength. The spirits strength would depend on level of cultivation, natural gifts, martial skills and many other variables which made it impossible to become so strong without the correct foundations for cultivation.Mo Xie was not worried about Chen Xing. After all he had a rock spirit so his defense skills were extremely high.\u201cFire\u201d whispered Lin Qian coldly. Chen Xing was suddenly covered in flames and his frozen body was trembling. His rocky body started to crack which caused him to give a blood-curdling scream. Everybody was staring in shock as his rocky body was blown to pieces.\u201cIce and fire.\u201d Mo Xie\u2019s face suddenly changed. A universal spirit, it was probably a universal spirit.\u201cLin Qian\u2019s strength is high. I lost.\u201d said Chen Xing looking depressed as he no longer had his body made from rocks to protect him. He went back to stand at Mo Xie\u2019s side, The crowd burst into an uproar. He lost. He actually lost.The Yun Hai sect had chosen an elite disciple to battle and he had been defeated. The Elders cheeks were burning, they had lost face.Chu Zhan Peng still had that enigmatic smile on his face. He glanced at everyone: \u201cHehe, as expected the disciple chosen by the Yun Hai Sect is very strong, but my junior disciple chosen by the Hao Yue Sect is extremely strong as well. The people who can beat her in this continent are few.\u201d\u201cI, Chu Zhan Peng wanted to find an outstanding disciple in the Yun Hai Sect to exchange pointers with Lin Qian, but I originally came because I had something to ask.\u201d\u201cWhat request do you have?\u201d Mo Xie said looking anxious.\u201cMy junior apprentice has an uncle and her uncle\u2019s son is called Lin Feng. He is truly insane. He humiliated some elders of their family and injured their clan\u2019s disciples. He is just an arrogant ordinary disciple. I hope the Yun Hai Sect will deliver him to me. I don\u2019t want the Yun Hai Sect to be known for having such disciples.\u201dMo Xie understood everything when he heard these words. That was Chu Zhan Peng\u2019s purpose behind all these events. Chu Zhan Peng knew that if he had directly asked to get a member of the Yun Hai Sect then the letter would have been refused as this would cause the sect to lose face. However he was very smart, he made Lin Qian defeat a Yun Hai Sect\u2019s elite disciple and then the words he carefully chose so that the clan wouldn\u2019t lose face by giving him Lin Feng.Of course if Mo Xie didn\u2019t accept Chu Zhan Peng\u2019s request, then he wouldn\u2019t be as friendly as he had been until that moment.\u201cIt seems like Lin Qian means a lot to him, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have come to the Yun Hai Sect for such a small matter. The universal spirit was indeed a very strong one. That\u2019s precisely what has brought him here for revenge.\u201d Mo Xie had already made a decision and said to the others: \u201cGo and bring Lin Feng here.\u201dWhen he heard these words, Chu Zhan Peng smiled and Lin Qian\u2019s eyes seemed to fill with killing intent.Lin Feng couldn\u2019t know what had happened in the Stormy Gorge as he was still training on the Precipice of Zhangu.Lin Feng was surrounded by an immense amount of sword Qi. Every hit he carried out with his sword was almost strong enough to kill him with a single strike and then it would be returned many times stronger. His dark spirit was completely released. He was using his Roaring Thunder skill without any flaws. There was a white light surrounding his body and thunderous roars were spreading throughout the atmosphere. It was a terrifying scene to anyone who could see.Lin Feng was in a complete frenzy and used all of his strength to bombard the drums. He was completely unaware at this point the sect was searching for him, to bring him to his execution.Here is Fridays regular release.

I will do a maximum of 4 chapters today.Enjoy! All hell is about to break loose. hehe xoxoLin Feng had completely released his dark spirit. Sweat was dripping all over his body as he struggled with every breath.The attacks had become overwhelmingly powerful. Lin Feng was definitely an exceptional talent which could only be seen every ten thousand years. It was almost like he was wielding ten thousand swords simultaneously. The thunderous roars had consumed the entire atmosphere within the precipice.Lin Feng was stunned at the progress he had made. He was able to predict when and how the counterattacks would strike back at him. He didn\u2019t stop attacking the drums for even a single second. If he stopped even briefly, the sword Qi from a single counterattack would crush him. Lin Feng had not anticipated this kind of situation.\u201cHow did it become powerful?\u201d Lin Feng had thousands of theories but could not comprehend his current situation. Lin Feng was never able to release such a powerful energy, so how could his returned energy be so much stronger. Even a Cultivator who had reached the Ling Qi layer would find it hard to release such a powerful attack.\u201cSince I started using the Roaring Thunder skill the energy from each attack has been accumulating and the sword Qi is getting stronger and stronger. This is how it reached such a tremendous power.\u201d Thought Lin Feng while still dodging each and every counter attack.The sword Qi had transformed into an unknown force\u2026 a force which seemed to be invincible.\u201cEven though Han Man had only reached the eighth Qi layer, it seemed like he was able to reach a perfect fusion with the Earth beneath his feet. The Earth was giving its power to him. It is precisely because he used the power of the Earth combined with his abilities that he was able to defeat Cultivators of the ninth Qi layer in the three punch match and even cause an injury to that disciple.\u201dLin Feng suddenly thought about the fight between Han Man and the Cultivator of the ninth Qi layer which gave him a brilliant idea. He had initially thought that Han Man could use the Earth\u2019s power because his spirit was an earth spirit but Lin Feng realized that this type of thinking was wrong. This power was all around us at all times and anyone could use this power as their own.Each time he used Nine Heavy Waves to attack the drums, the drums counterattacked.Each time he used Roaring Thunder to attack the drums, the drums counterattacked.Lin Feng had realized that if the eight drums didn\u2019t have the potential to attack. If Nine Heavy Waves bounced from the drums to come back at Lin Feng, it was because of the power within the attack. If Roaring Thunder bounced from the drums and came back at Lin Feng, it was because of the power of his Roaring Thunder skill.\u201cThe power!\u201d Lin Feng had a bright smile on his face. He suddenly changed the way he was using his sword and each of his attacks became more skillful and elegant. His sword play had become graceful and while each of his movements required unparalleled skill, when used by Lin Feng it seemed as easy as breathing.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026In the Stormy Gorge, in the Life or Death Arena suddenly a group of people approached from the sky.When the crowd in the Gorge saw these people, everyone from the Yun Hai Sect looked at them with the utmost respect. However in their hearts they were all a bit nervous and stunned at the turn of events. Chu Zhan Peng was one of the eight officials of the country; However the Yun Hai Patriarch reigned supreme over everyone within his territory, even though both sects had similar status. He was the great leader of the sect which made all of the Yun Hai Sect elders anxious upon his arrival.\u201cPatriarch, Great Elder\u201d Every member of the Yun Hai Sect bowed at the same time to greet the two special hosts.\u201cChu Zhan Peng greets Patriarch Nan Gong and Great Elder Mo.\u201d Said Chu Zhan Peng to the two who were calmly moving in his direction while slightly bowing with respect. He still had a strange smile on his face making him look handsome while giving away his treacherous intentions.\u201cYoung Master Chu Zhan Peng, how have you been these days?\u201d Nan Gong Ling looked at Chu Zhan Peng while nodding his head. Nan Gong Ling was middle aged but still had signs of youth on his face and he was surprisingly calm in front of the junior patriarch. His youth showed he had spent less time than most on the path to cultivation but still had a mature composure.\u201cNan Gong Ling is the youngest Patriarch the Yun Hai Clan has ever had throughout its history. Although you are not yet as strong as my father, but if we had to fight, I would have a lot of pressure and the outcome would be unknown. Your power is extraordinary for such a young age.\u201d Said Chu Zhan Peng looking calm. He was secretly amazed by Nan Gong Ling. Nan Gong Ling was the strongest disciple of the Yun Hai Sect in the past hundred years. He had become the Yun Hai Sect\u2019s Patriarch when he was only forty years old. His reputation was known throughout the world of cultivation.\u201cMy father is much stronger these days than when you had last seen him. He also told me to greet you when I left to come to the Yun Hai Sect.\u201d Chu Zhan Peng\u2019s father was actually the Patriarch of the Hao Yue Sect.Nan Gong Ling nodded and said: \u201cMo Xie, Chu Zhan Peng came here as a guest, how can you let him stand.\u201d\u201cThe great Chu Zhan Peng came to the Yun Hai Sect because he wants us to deliver him one of our ordinary disciples called Lin Feng.\u201d Mo Xie said explaining.\u201cBecause of an ordinary disciple?\u201d asked Nan Gong Ling frowning in irritation.Chu Zhan Peng quickly interrupted Mo Xie and said \u201cPatriarch Nan Gong Ling, Lin Feng is the son of this junior female apprentice\u2019s uncle. That young man has no regard for his elders and betters. He has injured one of his male cousins. He also insulted and humiliated his uncle, the father of my female junior apprentice. Therefore, my female junior apprentice wanted to come to solve their personal grudges.\u201dChu Zhan Peng was facing the great elders and the patriarch of the Yun Hai Sect, so he was careful not to sound too excessive with his words or he may not leave with his life. He wanted Nan Gong Ling to accept his request. Therefore he was using a mild and humble tone. However, Nan Gong Ling wasn\u2019t that kind of a person and he perfectly understood what was going on.\u201cMo Xie, how do you want to handle this?\u201d Asked Nan Gong Ling.Mo Xie didn\u2019t immediately reply. He secretly glanced at one of the great elders who was standing next to Nan Gong Ling.\u201cThat child, with no regard for his elders and betters is guilty. He should be expelled from the sect\u201d.Mo Xie was guarded in his speech. If he had directly said that he would deliver Lin Feng to Chu Zhan Peng to save face, it would definitely anger Nan Gong Ling. Lin Feng was still a Yun Hai Sect disciple after all. How could he deliver one of his disciples to the Hao Yue Sect without question? But saying he would expel Lin Feng from the Sect implied that everything that happened after would have nothing to do with the sect anymore as Lin Feng wouldn\u2019t be a disciple any longer. How cruel could Mo Xie possibly be to this ordinary disciple his own face?Nan Gong Ling was frowning and shaking his head. He knew exactly what Mo Xie had meant in his words. Nan Gong Ling would not willingly hand over any of his disciples.\u201cPatriarch, his behavior is harmful to our sect and its reputation, if he stayed in the Yun Hai Sect, it would be a disaster in the future. Mo Xie is begging that you expel that disciple for the well-being of the other disciples of the sect.\u201d Said Mo Cang Lan; one of the great elders from the sect.Everyone around them had perfectly understood the situation. A solution had to be found. Mo Cang Lan, as one of the Great Elders was also in charge of enforcement within the sect. His position within the hierarchy of the sect was extremely high. He was also Mo Xie\u2019s father. After what he said, it could be easily understood what the consequences for Lin Feng would be.\u201cOrdinary disciple.\u201d Whispered Nan Gong Ling. He was inwardly startled but didn\u2019t show it. He didn\u2019t approve Mo Xie\u2019s decision but Mo Cang Lan was a chief figure in the sect. Nan Gong Ling couldn\u2019t make Mo Cang Lan lose face because of a simple Ordinary disciple. Abandoning Lin Feng was the only solution.At that moment, Nan Gong Ling was about to agree.\u201cGOOONNNG\u201d A deep soul piercing sound was heard and it seemed that the sound echoed through the mountains, each vibration making all those present tremble slightly. It sounded like the gods were marching to battle in the heavens and these were the war drums they played.The whole crowd was puzzled. Where did such a loud and terrifying sound come from? They could not think what had caused the sound they had just heard. The Patriarch of the Yun Hai Sect, Nan Gong Ling had chills run down his spine as a light twinkled in his eyes. That was the sound of the drums on the Precipice of Zhangu.Mo Cang Lan was amazed. His eyes were twinkling as well. He gazed into the distance towards a certain mountain range. There was a precipice in that chain of mountains. On that overhanging cliff, there was a small room with eight drums. The drums there had not emitted a single sound in more than a hundred years.\u201cGOOOOONNG\u201d Another drum sound was heard as if it was rushing down from beyond the highest heavens.\u201cThat\u2026 That\u2019s the second drum! Impossible!\u201d Nan Gong Ling could not believe what he has just heard. Right after that, the smile on his face could not be removed. Only the most gifted and the strongest disciples, referred to as geniuses could make the drums emit a sound. They were looking forward to announcing that the Yun Hai Sect had an outstanding disciple, a true genius among geniuses.Nan Gong Ling\u2019s mood wasn\u2019t good because of what had happened with Chu Zhan Peng. Being in such a situation because of a disciple while being a large sect like the Yun Hai Sect was embarrassing. But at that moment, Nan Gong Ling had forgotten these events and could not contain his excitement. It had been more than a hundred years since the beating sound of the drums had been heard. Now he had heard the beating sound of the drums twice.\u201cI don\u2019t know who that disciple is\u2026 Unbelievably he was able to pass the test of the Precipice of Zhangu.\u201d Said Nan Gong Ling. He was asking himself who had passed the test. He had completely forgotten that problem with Chu Zhan Peng.\u201cGOOOOONNNGGG\u201dThe third beating sound of the drums spread throughout the sky above the Yun Hai Sect. That time, almost everyone in the Yun Hai Sect looked at the heavens with a slight fear showing in their eyes, but some of the stronger disciples could somewhat tell the direction the sound was coming from and nothing more. The strongest disciples knew the sound they were hearing. It had been a long time since they had been so thrilled.Nan Gong Ling was also staring at the sky. The history of the clan dated back a thousand years\u2026 and it had been three hundred years since three beating drum sounds were heard.\u201cPhewww\u2026\u201d Nan Gong Ling was breathing deeply and struggling to contain his excitement. The Patriarch of the Sect was so young and yet in his generation he would bring untold glory back to the Sect.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 - The Unknown ForcePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe sound of the drums from the Precipice of Zhangu had given an unprecedented shock to the members of the Yun Hai Sect. Each time they thought the beating sound of the drums would stop, another one was heard.When the seventh drum sound was heard, the Yun Hai Sect members quieted down. Only the pure sound made from beating the drums was remaining in the total silence that had spread across the Sect.The entire Yun Hai Sect was still in confusion but many had the feeling of good fortune arriving on the sect. It was as if the vibrations in the air and sound coming from those drums were the only things left in the universe. It was as if the entire Yun Hai Sect and even the entire universe was enveloped by the power of those drums.Nan Gong Ling was standing with his hands clasped behind his back. He was gazing into the distance towards the Precipice of the Abyss with an amazed look on his face. Nan Gong Ling\u2019s robes were swinging in the gentle breeze that was blowing over the area. Not a sound could be heard from him. Everyone else who was standing around him, Mo Cang Lan, Mo Xie, the Yun Hai Sect\u2019s disciples, Lin Qian and even Chu Zhan Peng were gazing into the distance. They had the feeling that on that mountain was a god beating his war drum to announce he had been born. A new God of War had descended.Inside the cave in the mountains, the old man wearing a black cloak had stood up and was looking at the overhanging cliff slightly surprised. He had a solemn and respectful facial expression.The old man wearing the black cloak protected the Precipice of the Abyss, which was a sacred place for the Yun Hai Sect. Even though few people knew he existed, the Patriarch of the Sect Nan Gong Ling, when he saw this elder he would bow out of respect.The old man had seen that Lin Feng was only at the eighth Qi layer and that his spirit was quite weak, so he had made him go through the passageway that led to the precipice with the hardest exam hoping that Lin Feng would be able to return in one piece once faced with the difficulties of the exam. He had never thought that considering the circumstances, a disciple of only eighth Qi Layer while using a weak snake spirit would be the first to successfully pass that exam.What impressed the old man is that the beating sounds of the drums seemed to remain in the air for an extended time and the entire Yun Hai Sect was consumed in that sound. The seventh beating sound of the drums had already been heard.In the thousand year history of the Yun Han Sect, such a miracle had never happened. Nobody had ever managed to make the drums beat so many times and on top of that the sounds were never this profound.The old man entered the passageway towards the Precipice of Zhangu. He was walking up the flight of stairs step by step with the same respectful and solemn expression on his face as before. It looked like he was expecting the eighth beating sound of the drums.At that moment, the sword Qi was still filling the atmosphere completely creating an unknown force, but now it was no longer disorganized. It was following Lin Feng\u2019s hand in which he was holding his long sword. Lin Feng at that moment looked invincible.\u201cThe force of the sword, it can be found everywhere.\u201d Lin Feng thought while smiling. These drums were intriguingly marvelous. There had to be enough power in each attack for the drums to produce a strong enough counterattack which could then be used to produce a beating sound. This is what Lin Feng was precisely doing at that moment. He was producing more powerful attacks to increase the sword force in the atmosphere to attack the drums so that they could produce beating sounds.\u201cI already made the drums beat seven times. Let\u2019s make them beat one last time. That would be eight beats for eight drums. The last one has to be perfect and I\u2019ll pass the test of the Precipice of Zhangu. Then I will have to thank that Elder\u201d Said Lin Feng. At that moment Lin Feng thought that this actually was the easiest test on Heaven Mountain within the precipice of abyss and the Elder really had been lenient with his request.He held his long sword in his hand and the entire atmosphere was fusing with his sword and absorbing an incredible amount of energy.\u201cHERE COME THE DRUMS!\u201d shouted Lin Feng. The Sword Qi turned into a radiant light and the drums beat one last time.\u201cGOOOOOOONNNNNNNNGGGG\u201d the last drum emitted a sound which spread throughout the entire atmosphere of the Yun Hai Sect to the point that the mountains were vibrating. The vibrating sound lasted for a while. Lin Feng\u2019s Dark spirit which was behind him vanished from sight. Triumphantly he sat down,with no power left he slumped his body across the floor.\u201cNow I should be able to find some pills which will cure Han Man.\u201d Even though Lin Feng was exhausted, he had a big smile on his face.A loud rumbling sound was suddenly heard. The large stone doors of the precipice opened. There was a silhouette to be seen inside the doorway. It was the old man wearing the black cloak who had pointed him to this trial.Seeing that it was the old man and remembering the familiar black cloak, Lin Feng while struggling he once again rose to his feet. He then said to the old man: \u201cElder, did I finally pass the test? Will I be able to get the pills I need for my friend?\u201dThe old man looked at Lin Feng who had a smile on his face while still looking completely stupefied. Immediately after that an unknown expression appeared on his face. Lin Feng wasn\u2019t aware of what he had done but maybe he had angered this esteemed elder. He hadn\u2019t come with the goal of achieving something unprecedented. He had just come to get some medicine for his friend who was injured and did not care about what he had achieved in the sect. Status and power meant nothing if he had no friends to share them with.\u201cOf course you can.\u201d Said the old man in the black cloak while smiling. He took out a jar full of unknown profound pills and threw it at Lin Feng saying: \u201cThere are some healing pills inside. One is enough to cure your friend completely. How you use the others is something you can decide by yourself. These pills are precious and you might need them later.\u201d\u201cThank you, esteemed Elder.\u201d Lin Feng was surprised. According to the old man, one pill was enough to cure Han Man\u2019s injuries. Such a pill was beyond extremely precious and valuable. The old man had given him an entire jar. Understanding the old man\u2019s status and strength, Lin Feng knew the old man wasn\u2019t trying to fool him but was wondering why he would go so far for such an easy test.\u201cYou passed the exam so you deserve it. However you should remember this, don\u2019t share the fact that you passed the exam of the Precipice of Zhangu with random people.\u201d Explained the old man to Lin Feng. Lin Feng had only reached the eighth Qi layer and had managed to produce eight drum beats. No matter how Lin Feng had done that, his talent in the Yun Hai Sect\u2019s entire history was never seen before. He was a real genius. The old man hoped Lin Feng wouldn\u2019t raise the attention of any evil people before he had the chance to fully bloom.In the Xue Yue Country including the Yun Hai Sect, there were certain people who secretly hunted and killed extremely skilled and outstanding disciples before they could gain power. It was not a rare thing for jealousy to be born of those with talent. Today the sounds of the drums had been heard throughout the entire Sect\u2019s territory, it would probably make him the biggest target within the Sect. It would be best if he could lay low and not cause any trouble, then after a few years he would shine, otherwise his path would be a truly bloody one.\u201cAlright.\u201d Lin Feng didn\u2019t clearly understand why the old man in the black cloak was saying that but he was still nodding his head.The old man in the black cloak raised his head and looked in the distance: \u201cProtector Bei, take him back.\u201dLin Feng was stunned. There were only perilous cliffs and precipices here. One could see very far in the distance when looking around and there was clearly no one else around. Obviously the old man wouldn\u2019t be talking to the air.\u201cOk, old friend, let\u2019s go back young\u2019en.\u201d Said a voice coming from the middle of the mountains in the distance. Lin Feng raised his head and saw someone falling down from the sky. This old man had a familiar looking face and had two gigantic wings, two dream-like snow-white wings. They looked like the wings of a crane. This was a crane spirit.\u201cStrong Cultivators can fly and they can even carry people through the skies. I would have never thought that the Yun Hai Sect had such Cultivators.\u201d Lin Feng found the scene absolutely fascinating. He had the feeling a hurricane was coming and that he was unable to stand firm or move away.Sand and small stones were flying around in the air. The crane-like silhouette landed on the overhanging cliff. Lin Feng was staring: it was him!Lin Feng knew the person who had appeared. It was the old man of the Xing Chen Pavilion. He still looked sluggish and had a neglected appearance. He looked the same as the last time, but with a giant set of wings on his back.\u201cThe Elder who was in charge of protecting the Xing Chen Pavilion was as expected, not even slightly ordinary.\u201d Said Lin Feng to himself convinced.\u201cYoung man, I will introduce you. My old friend is one of the protectors of the Yun Hai Sect. You can call him Protector Kong. I am one of the protectors of the Yun Hai Sect as well and you can call me Protector Bei.\u201d The old man\u2019s mood seemed to be particularly good. Protectors of the Sect have an extraordinary status in the hierarchy, to the extent that even if the Patriarch of the Sect was to see them, he would not dare be insolent.The ones who became protectors showed extreme devotion and loyalty towards the Sect. Their abilities were far above that of other disciples. They only cared about the Sect; that was the only thing they had in their mind. How could the Protector Bei not be happy that Lin Feng had passed the test of the Precipice of Zhangu?\u201cProtector Bei, Protector Kong.\u201d Lin Feng was smiling at the two old men. Two protectors of the Sect\u2026 They were probably within the strongest Cultivators of the Sect.Protector Kong silently nodded his head. Shortly after, he went back into the cave. His body just vanished into the darkness of the passageway.\u201cMy old friend spends his time in this cave every day. It\u2019s common for him not to speak for days. He never did speak much so it doesn\u2019t matter. \u201c Protector Bei was shaking his head. He then said to Lin Feng: \u201cWe\u2019re leaving too.\u201dThe crane spirit appeared briefly, its wings flapped in the air giving a hurricane-like sensation. Lin Feng only felt his body flying up in the air guided by a mysterious power. There was nothing under his feet, only the distant ground. Lin Feng had the feeling he was dreaming. In the previous world, it would have been impossible to fly up in the air like this without the assistance of technology.However in the Continent of the Nine Clouds, extreme power and strength enabled some Cultivators to look down on the world from above.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21 - Questioning an ElderPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySpecial Thanks to No Name Required for this sponsored chapter.I hope you all like the new website. We have another chapter coming shortly. I will leave you with this cliffhanger hehe xoxoIn order not to draw other people\u2019s attention and to remain discreet, Protector Bei had decided to make Lin Feng move to another room which was also designed for Ordinary disciples, but it was situated in the forest, far away from many disciples.Lin Feng could not wait and started heading towards Han Man. When he passed his new training room, he didn\u2019t even give it a glance and continued forward.\u201dLin Feng.\u201dLin Feng turned around and saw a disciple who was surprisingly waiting at the door of his training room.Lin Feng was annoyed because that room was supposed to be kept secret. It was disciple\u2019s sacred training place. Lin Feng wasn\u2019t expecting anyone, so how did they know where to look for him. The disciple had even taken the liberty to open the door and look inside. What if there were private or even secret things within that room?\u201cYou know about the Sect\u2019s rules, you are not allowed to enter other disciple\u2019s rooms.\u201d Lin Feng said as his anger was building. He knew that disciple, his name was Hou Qing. He was ranked within the top 10 ordinary disciples of the Sect. He was also in charge of making sure that the rules of the Sect were respected by the Ordinary disciples. Lin Feng knew him because of the status he held within the Sect. Besides, he also knew Lin Feng.In the Yun Hai Sect, Mo Cang Lan was one of the great Elders. He enjoyed a high status. He was also responsible for making sure that the rules of the Sect were being respected by everyone. In the Yun Hai Sect the people in charge of making sure that the rules of the Sect were being respected were numerous. There were some who had to watch the Ordinary disciples and others who had to watch the Elite disciples.Hou Qing often abused the power he had as a disciple in charge of maintaining the rules of the Sect. However Lin Feng had not expected him to dare break one of the most sacred rules within the sect.\u201cOf course I know that rule. But such a rule doesn\u2019t need to be applied when it comes to you, piece of trash.\u201d Hou Qing looked sluggish. He wasn\u2019t looking straight into Lin Feng\u2019s eyes. In his thoughts, Lin Feng was still the piece of trash he used to be when he was at the fifth Qi layer.\u201cFollow me.\u201d Said Hou Qing.\u201cI have no time.\u201d Lin Feng started walking again. Han Man was still injured and was waiting for his pills. Why would he give Hou Qing face when he had better things to do with his time.\u201cHuh?\u201d Hou Qing was stunned when he saw that Lin Feng was ignoring him. He was furious and his figure suddenly vanished.A madly strong wind started blowing and a silhouette appeared in front of Lin Feng. It was Hou Qing.Hou Qing was very proud of his Agility Technique as he knew how strong it was, especially when he saw Lin Feng was frowning. The piece of trash was obviously shocked by such great skills.\u201cOne of the Elders of the Sect wants to see you. Are you not going?\u201d said Hou Qing in a mocking tone, as if Lin Feng had been making a fool of himself.\u201cOne of the Elders wants to meet me?\u201d said Lin Feng who was surprised. Was it because of the Life or Death Arena killing? Impossible, he had killed everyone who had known his true identity. Was it because of what had happened at the Precipice of Zhangu? Impossible, Protector Kong didn\u2019t want that news to spread within the Sect, Protector Bei wouldn\u2019t want that either. They definitely wouldn\u2019t let Hou Qing know about it or send him to pick up Lin Feng. They also knew he would have business with Han Man.One of the Elders surprisingly wanted to meet Lin Feng and there was no reason to refuse.\u201cWait for me for a little while, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Said Lin Feng to Hou Qing and walked away, which left Hou Qing stunned once again. That guy had learnt that an Elder wanted to see him and he dared make one of the sect elders wait. Hou Qing was furious but he then remembered that Lin Feng was going to have to face the reality later anyway, so it was only a matter of time.Lin Feng went to Han Man\u2019s room as quickly as he could and he gave him three pills. Han Man gladly accepted them and swallowed them immediately. Lin Feng had given him three of his priceless profound healing pills to make sure there was nothing left unhealed within his friend. He made sure to sit next to the bed waiting for his recovery.\u201cLin Feng, did you go to the Precipice of the Abyss?\u201d Jing Yun asked uncertain while looking at Lin Feng.Lin Feng nodded. He would not lie to Han Man or to Jing Yun but when he remembered the words of the protectors; he could only nod without making a sound.Jing Yun already knew that he had been successful when she saw Lin Feng\u2019s expression. Jing Yun somehow knew that he had gone to the Precipice of the Abyss, taken some pills and come back. She also knew that if anyone could pass the exam it would be Lin Feng.Han Man had the sensation of waves that were flowing in his body from an unknown source. He opened his eyes and looked at Lin Feng in astonishment. He didn\u2019t say anything but he felt thankful to have such an amazing friend. He could feel countless warm waves of healing energy were flowing into his body without stopping.\u201cLin Feng. Thank you\u201d said Han Man. During the short time he spent with Lin Feng there was already no doubt about them being true friends. Han Man would always remember the name of such a friend in his heart. If the heavens ever threatened to punish Lin Feng then they would first have to punish Han Man in his place.What a true friend! He had killed Jing Feng and wanted to bear the consequences alone, he had shared precious items with them even though he had killed the ferocious wild beasts on his own, he was also able to kill Jiang Huai and Jing Hao by himself and then he was also able to go to the Precipice of the Abyss and pass the exam only to save his friend Han Man. In this world it would be hard to find someone who would do so much for someone they had known for such a short time. Lin Feng truly valued all of his friendships and the people he would call friends.After a short time, Han Man could feel that his body had almost completely recovered. He could feel that his body was still recovering. There was no longer any pain just the sensation of pins prickling his skin. He has shockingly recovered so fast.Jing Yun saw how quickly Han Man was recovering and that the bruises on his face had disappeared. She was amazed at how quickly the profound healing pills affected the body and how strong they were.\u201cThese pills are very useful, as expected from the protectors\u201d Lin Feng thought when he saw how quickly Han Man was recovering. Lin Feng was smiling and had finally started to relax.\u201cHan Man since you are recovering so quickly. I can no longer stay with you as I have something I must attend.\u201dBefore leaving Lin Feng took three pills out of the jar and gave them to Jing Yun. He said: \u201cJing Yun, If his injuries don\u2019t completely recover then you must immediately give him these three profound healing pills. I am relying on you for this task.\u201d\u201cLin Feng, don\u2019t worry, I will do as you say.\u201d Jing Yun took the three profound healing pills and then watched as Lin Feng left.Lin Feng was following Hou Qing as they were going towards the Stormy Gorge and more precisely towards the Life or Death Arena. Lin Feng saw that there were many disciples gathered around the arena. He had no idea what could have happened and why they were all gathered at such a place when there were no sounds of battle.More importantly he was wondering which Elder wanted to see him and for what reason.\u201cPatriarch, Elder Mo, I brought Lin Feng.\u201d Hou Qing said respectfully taking Lin Feng to the Life or Death Arena.\u201cThis is our Yun Hai Sect\u2019s Patriarch Nan Gong Ling and Great Elder Mo Cang Lan.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s jaw had almost hit the ground upon those words. He didn\u2019t expect to meet such important people and they had directly called for him. He looked around and saw Chu Zhan Peng and Lin Qian. Lin Qian looked at him with a cold smile on her face.\u201cWhat is she doing here?\u201d\u201cLin Feng, do you know the crimes you have committed?\u201d Mo Xie asked Lin Feng with a sinister and dark look in his eyes.\u201cElder, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Said Lin Feng shaking his head and feeling cold sweat dripping down his back. Mo Xie was an esteemed Elder within the sect. Lin Feng felt that something really bad was about to happen.\u201cYou don\u2019t understand? You are a disciple and you don\u2019t understand your elders, you hurt your brothers and sisters, insult your elders and your betters. You are the shame of the Yun Hai Sect. You are a disgrace. You are trash.\u201d Mo Xie had made sure to embellish the charges and even made sure to humiliate him because of the agreement he had made with Chu Zhan Peng to save face. Because Lin Feng was a mere Ordinary disciple, nobody would question Chu Zhan Peng on how he had intended to dispose of him. Nobody wanted the patriarch of the Yun Hai Sect to be alarmed.He had embellished all these accusations in front of everyone and intended to have Lin Feng expelled from the Yun Hai Sect. He had made sure to apply as much pressure as possible so a mere ordinary disciple could not rebuke his accusations.\u201cDisgrace, Trash, making the Yun Hai Sect lose face?\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s eyes looked perplex and then he looked at Lin Qian and understood what was going on. He couldn\u2019t understand Elder Mo Xie though and why he would stand on Lin Qian\u2019s side. Even though Lin Feng wasn\u2019t a famous disciple, he was still a disciple of the Sect.\u201cWhy are you not talking? You can all see how guilty he is simply by his unwillingness to defend from these accusations?\u201d Mo Xie said coldly looking at Lin Feng who remained silent.\u201cElder, you listed many of the charges against me without evidence. I am just an ordinary disciple and apparently the words of the little people do not matter much to the almighty esteemed elders of the Yun Hai Sect. Even if I proved my innocence, I am already deemed guilty by such a wise all knowing and all seeing Elder. Do I need to say anything?\u201d\u201cHow impudent\u201d shouted Mo Xie who didn\u2019t expect such sharp words from Lin Feng. Lin Feng had indeed made a reference to how lowly ordinary disciples were treated and how the elders could accuse anyone of anything without even needing proof of their accusations.\u201cHow dare you speak back to me! I\u2019m one of the Elders of the Sect, My duty within the sect is to questions disciples on their crimes. Do you even realize speaking back to an Elder of the sect is a crime itself?\u201d\u201cIf I don\u2019t say a word then you take it as me admitting my guilt to all of your accusations. However when I choose to speak, you accuse me of going against an elder who is performing his duties. I, Lin Feng, would like to ask such a biased Elder, who exactly are you working for? Surely the master could not have wandered far from his obedient lap dog?\u201d shouted Lin Feng.When he came to accuse Lin Fen, Mo Xie was already convinced of the crimes that he had committed as if he had witnessed them. Nothing could change his mind. He thought Lin Feng was guilty of bringing shame to the sect. He treated Lin Feng like an animal. Lin Feng knew that Mo Xie would make things difficult for him no matter what he did. Not saying a word would be a crime, but arguing would be a crime as well. Why would he need to restrain his actions when he was already guilty either way?In front of the entire crowd, all members of the Sect, Lin Feng looked down on Mo Xie and was not frightened at all.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Tomorrow is another slave day, but I will try and keep it to 2-3 chapters if possible.Special Thanks to all you supporters, even more to Metazone for sponsoring this chapter. You have all made me feel so welcome and I really hope you will support Pan Pan just as much as you have me. You have really made my experience with translating this novel an absolute joy and I love you all for that xoxoSo to thank you. Here is another cliffhanger\u2026 Enjoy!\u201cThat guy is really brave. He actually dares to speak back to an Elder.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a madman who acts recklessly. It seems like he\u2019s tired of living.\u201dThe crowd was discussing loudly looking on with eyes filled with pity. They obviously hadn\u2019t expected Lin Feng to be audacious enough to directly confront an Elder.In the Continent of Nine Clouds, it was a period of great prosperity for the Sect. The Sect was so strong that it could almost call itself a nation. They could bring either peace or destruction wherever they went without anyone batting an eye. Within the Sect there was a fierce competition for power. The ranks in the hierarchy were extremely strict. First, there were the Ordinary disciples and the Elite disciples which were the seedlings within the sect. Then there were Ordinary Elders and Grand Elders. Ordinary was the lowest ranking whether it was an elder or a disciple. Each had their own parts to play within the sect and no one went against the hierarchy.Lin Feng was an Ordinary disciple and that\u2019s all. Between him and Mo Xie, the difference in status; within the hierarchy of the Sect was huge. If Mo Xie wanted Lin Feng to live, then he would live, if Mo Xie wanted Lin Feng to die, then he would die. This was the difference between them.Mo Xie was shocked and embarrassed because Lin Feng had directly spoken out against him and made him look a fool.\u201cHou Qing, is contradicting a Sect\u2019s Elder a crime?\u201d Mo Xie said as he was intensely staring at Lin Feng and not moving at all.\u201cArguing against an esteemed Elder, is the highest crime and he should be expelled from the sect. He should have his cultivation crippled for offending an elder of such high regard and then have his position in the sect revoked.\u201d Said Mo Xie.How did Hou Qing not understand what Mo Xie meant? How could he miss such a great opportunity?\u201cElder, Hou Qing thinks that Lin Feng is guilty of all crimes of which he has been accused, He should cripple his own cultivation and should be expelled from the Sect.\u201d He said with a wry smile.\u201cNo need, he has worked so hard to acquire such meager skills, we should pity the pitiful. Just go cut off one of his arms and then you can expel him from the Sect.\u201d Mo Xie said in a magnanimous tone as if he was being generous to Lin Feng.\u201cHow vicious.\u201d Lin Feng hated him. He thought Mo Xie was unfair. It was at that moment that Mo Xie had been added to Lin Feng\u2019s list and as long as Lin Feng lived Mo Xie\u2019s blood would eventually spill. Lin Feng was accused of many crimes; he would be expelled from the Sect no matter what. He would instantly be given to Lin Qian as a gift. He was scared that Lin Qian and that creepy young guy wouldn\u2019t let him live if they captured him. They had obviously come to take his life.In fact, it was precisely what Lin Feng had anticipated. Because they had sent an Elder after him, the situation was already hopeless. He would die if he complied, he would die if he resisted.\u201cOn the path of Cultivation those who don\u2019t have sufficient power and natural talent will die. The Sect is also unreliable and can no longer be trusted.\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s heart was like a mirror. This world, everything that had happened, the thing you could count on is your own power. This moment was also solidifying Lin Feng\u2019s concept of this world, an Elder wanted to rip his arm off and to expel him from the Sect; based on false accusations, but that did not matter.Lin Feng glanced at Nan Gong Ling. The patriarch of the Sect hadn\u2019t said a word so far. He did not want to be part of what was happening and so distanced himself.\u201cEverything requires strength and natural talent. At the moment, I am not strong which means I need to unveil my real talent.\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s thoughts were quick. \u201cIf there is no solution, then I should reveal what I did at the Precipice of Zhangu\u201d.When he had made the drums beat, two protectors of the Sect had shown up and personally accompanied him back to the Sect. Lin Feng still had doubts as the exam he had passed was an easy one. The exam that he had passed as he initially thought wasn\u2019t an easy one. He had fooled himself into thinking it was easy because of the Protectors kindness.At that moment, Hou Qing was already in front of Lin Feng with evil intentions. Many people were staring at them. Even some great Elders were watching with disdain at the execution of an ordinary disciple. Hou Qing was feeling nervous and excited at the same time. That was a great opportunity for him to show his skills to the Elders.\u201cPiece of trash, you can cut off your arm yourself. There is a huge difference between my strength and your strength. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re worth fighting.\u201d Said Hou Qing in an arrogant tone.Lin Feng saw Hou Qing\u2019s twinkling eyes and felt exasperated. Hou Qing didn\u2019t have a strong personality. For one of the best Ordinary disciples, he was just a pathetic weakling.\u201cI would rather see how you were planning to take my arm.\u201d Said Lin Feng while unsheathing his sword and held it firmly in front of him. He was standing calmly and didn\u2019t attempt to move an inch from where he was originally standing. He felt like an unmovable mountain, he had no fear remaining.\u201cHaha, if it has to be like that, then I will show the elders how you really are worthless.\u201d Said Hou Qing who obviously knew Lin Feng wasn\u2019t going to cut off his own arm. A moment ago he had humiliated Lin Feng and made himself appear merciful which would have a great impact on the elders.\u201cDancing Wind: Agility Technique.\u201dHou Qing vanished in a flash. Dancing Wind: Agility Technique. He had mastered his agility technique to perfection. His moves were so quick it was as if he was dancing on the wind.\u201cFellow disciple Hou Qing is amongst the ten best ordinary disciples. His agility techniques are outstanding for someone within the ordinary disciples. How could Lin Feng compete with him?\u201d\u201cThat guy can still stand and look that calm. He\u2019s looking for death, this fight is already over.\u201dThe crowd was looking at Hou Qing who was as quick as the wind. The crowd was loud. Hou Qing was one of the best ordinary disciples. When he was using his agility techniques, even those who were higher in rankings than him, were not able to match his speed.When Mo Xie saw Hou Qing\u2019s agility technique, he smiled a confident smile. It seemed like Hou Qing\u2019s strength had increased again. He hoped Hou Qing would be able to be one of the five best Ordinary disciples of the Sect by the beginning of the following year so that Mo Xie as his teacher would also gain in reputation.Whether Hou Qing could defeat Lin Feng or not, Mo Xie had never considered that as a plausible question. Lin Feng was merely at the eighth Qi layer. He estimated that Lin Feng would only be able to make three moves before Hou Qing took his arm, without Lin Feng being able to see his movements.Amongst the people who were present, sadly it seemed like there was only Lin Feng who believed that he would win, everyone else was prepared to see Lin Feng\u2019s blood. He was holding his sword out with only one hand and he stood motionless like a mountain. Hou Qing was incredibly quick and did not stop dancing from side to side around Lin Feng.At that moment, a strong whistling wind appeared and Lin Feng\u2019s robes were like a flag in the wind. His long hair was flying in all directions, yet he still remained unmoving. Suddenly, Hou Qing\u2019s silhouette vanished again.\u201cIt\u2019s the end. Fellow disciple Hou Qing\u2019s agility techniques are just too exceptional for even elite disciples.\u201dThe battle hadn\u2019t even really started that the crowd was already coming to conclusions.Everybody could only see that Lin Feng had closed his eyes. He was feeling calm and his robes were still being blown by the wind created from Hou Qing dancing around him. His breathing was steady and his heart was calm. Suddenly, he stopped breathing and only concentrated all of his senses on the current location of his opponent.Lin Feng\u2019s sword suddenly moved. His sword was dancing on the wind as if copying Hou Qing\u2019s skill. He looked graceful and agile with only calmness on his face.\u201cAAAHHH\u201d a loud scream was heard coming from above Lin Feng\u2019s head. Suddenly an oppressive energy filled the atmosphere and shocked many of the onlookers.\u201cToo Weak\u201dLin Feng only said these two words. His sword was still shining and spotless. Right after that, the entire crowd saw blood splash in all directions.The whole crowd was gasping in shock. What they were looking at was inconceivable.Hou Qing had been unable even retaliate against Lin Feng. He had lost. It had been an easy win for Lin Feng, he had cut off one of Hou Qing\u2019s arms in a single strike during Hou Qing\u2019s agility technique.\u201cHow is that even possible?\u201d\u201cHow did Lin Feng do that?\u201dshouted some of the ordinary disciples. They were extremely surprised especially since many of them had heard Lin Feng\u2019s reputation and that he was called a piece of trash by many ordinary disciples. How could he have cut off one of Hou Qing\u2019s arms in one attack with such little effort?All these ordinary disciples hadn\u2019t seen clearly how Lin Feng had attacked but the Elite disciples had all seen very clearly. Lin Feng had been so quick using his sword that he had managed to borrow strength from the wind and cut Hou Qing\u2019s arm, to many onlookers it seemed that it was actually the wind itself which cut off the arm before the sword had even reached.\u201cA sword that can fuse with the wind and borrow its strength. Did the Xing Chen Pavilion have such sword skills?\u201d asked Nan Gong Ling as it was the first time in his life that he had seen such a thing. Lin Feng\u2019s sword-play had been wonderful. It could really been defined as perfect. He hadn\u2019t used any unnecessary strength in his attack. He had followed the wind and had cut off one of Hou Qing\u2019s arms. This was Lin Feng\u2019s exact goal as if he had wanted to take Hou Qing\u2019s life, he could have done that in one hit before anyone was able to react.Lin Feng hadn\u2019t practiced any particular skill for his sword to fuse with the wind. It was just an insight that he had gained when he was at the Precipice of Zhangu, he had realized that the sword, the sky as well as the all things within creation, all had a force which could be used. The sword had a sword force, the wind had a wind force. He had just used that wind force. He had followed the wind with his sword which had created a fusion between the sword and the wind and then cleanly sliced off his opponents arm.\u201cWasn\u2019t that him using the wind force?\u201d asked Nan Gong Ling considering that possibility. But he immediately rejected that idea because Lin Feng was only at the eighth Qi layer, how would he be able to comprehend what using the force of wind was?A Cultivator of the Qi layer couldn\u2019t use forces from the elements. Only Cultivators who had reached the Ling Qi layer and a few geniuses were able to use forces of the elements. If a Cultivator of the Qi layer wanted to use those forces, he could only do that using the power of his spirit. A cultivator could use forces only by using his spirit but during that fight, Lin Feng hadn\u2019t released his spirit at all.\u201cThat piece of trash has become strong. No wonder he became insane. However as far as I\u2019m concerned, that piece of trash is as before, still a piece of trash. That will not change today.\u201d Thought Lin Qian who had seen Lin Feng cut off his opponent\u2019s arm in one hit and one single attempt. She was at the Ling Qi layer and her spirit was becoming stronger and stronger and was on the brink of awakening. She had an ice and fire universal spirit. That small piece of trash, Lin Feng, was no match for her.Mo Xie looked extremely embarrassed at that moment. He had appointed Hou Qing to cut off Lin Feng\u2019s arm and hadn\u2019t thought Lin Feng would cut off one of Hou Qing\u2019s arms effortlessly in a single strike. It was as if he had been slapped in the face. Lin Feng had to die.Lin Feng hadn\u2019t noticed everybody\u2019s face. He was looking just as calm as before. He had put his sword carefully back into his scabbard. He looked at Hou Qing who was on the ground, on his knees and didn\u2019t feel the least bit of pity. He just continued to stay unmoving as if nothing had happened.\u201cOne of the top ten within the ordinary disciples ranking. It\u2019s clear that when you said I was not worth fighting that you were not prepared to lose your own arm.\u201d Lin Feng was looking at Hou Qing mockingly and said: \u201cI really don\u2019t understand why you allow yourself to be that arrogant when you are so pathetically weak, I would be ashamed if I was your teacher.\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 - The Terrifying ShadowPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayExtra special thanks to Joseph G, he has been extremely supportive of this series and is clearly an addict. He has been a complete darling from the start. Thank you xoxoThis is the first of two chapters which have been sponsored today. I will not be staying up extremely late like yesterday as I have work, so all donations from here on out will go to sponsored chapters during the week.TL Note: To give a dog a bad name and hang it is an idiom to give someone a reputation they will then be unable to remove. I could not think of another way to phrase it.I hope you all enjoy!! The next release will be in around 45 minutes, I just need to edit and proofread it now.Hou Qing was using his other hand to cover the bloody wound where his arm used to be. Blood was pouring endlessly out of the wound and through his fingers to form a puddle on the floor. He looked absolutely terrified and couldn\u2019t come to grips with how he had lost his arm. The scene was so shocking that no one could believe what they had just seen.\u201cYou, it must have been luck! If you didn\u2019t have such good luck then\u2026.\u201d Hou Qing said while looking at Lin Feng in a sinister way. At that moment he still believed that Lin Feng hadn\u2019t beaten him and that Lin Feng\u2019s strength was hugely inferior to his. Everything that happened when he randomly swung his sword must have been luck, how could he even know where Hou Qing was? Lin Feng had just been lucky and when he was slashing the air managed to accidently strike the arm. Hou Qing wasn\u2019t the only one to think that way, many ordinary disciples within the crowd had the same train of though. They really couldn\u2019t believe that Lin Feng had seen Hou Qing moving at such high speeds and simple used a single strike to accurately slice off his arm.\u201cI do indeed have great luck.\u201d Lin Feng looked surprised for a second then smiled and replied. He had really been lucky indeed to have this opportunity to knock Hou Qing down a notch.\u201cNext time, I will not go easy on you and I will give you no chance to retaliate\u201d said Hou Qing walking unsteadily. He moved away from Lin Feng and moved through the crowd of disciples. His arm had been cut cleanly off and this was not an injury he could leave without medical assistance. His wound required medical assistance as quickly as possible or he would lose his life along with his arm. He had already lost so much blood that it was hard for him to stand.\u201cI hope that you will not be as foolish as to challenge me to a \u2018next time\u2019.\u201d said Lin Feng feeling powerless and shaking his head. Hou Qing still didn\u2019t accept the fact that he had lost and attributed Lin Feng\u2019s victory to luck, with that kind of temperament then he would come back for revenge and end up losing his other arm.\u201cYou dared to injure a disciple in charge of dealing out justice when the Sects rules are not respected. The Sect doesn\u2019t mean anything to you, it\u2019s clear in your eyes that you see us as something you can disrespect.\u201d Mo Xie was blaming Lin Feng once again, accusing him of whatever he wished to suit his needs at the time.While smiling, Lin Feng said to Mo Xie: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to give a dog a bad name and then hang him. If I understand what you mean properly, you\u2019re saying that I should have let him cut my arm and then get expelled from the Sect and on top of that I should still have the Sect in my heart. Don\u2019t you think that your analysis in itself, is ridiculous and laughable, Elder?\u201dLin Feng was provoking Elder Mo, They all wanted to cut off his arm then expel him from the Sect and on top on that they wanted him to care about giving the sect the respect it deserves. Lin Feng admired Mo Xie for being able to say such stupid things with a straight face.\u201cPatriarch, am I allowed to add something to what has been said already?\u201d asked Lin Feng completely disregarding Mo Xie yet again. If there was someone who had the power to make decisions in this situation, it was definitely Nan Gong Ling.Nan Gong Ling had an expression on his face which showed that he couldn\u2019t help but be interested in this young disciple. He was actually was very interested in Lin Feng and his actions. Lin Feng was neither overbearing nor subservient, neither arrogant nor humble. Lin Feng was completely calm and composed even though in such a seemingly disastrous position. That was exactly the temperament required to be a great Cultivator and to improve with leaps and bounds on the path of Cultivation. \u201dYou may speak.\u201d Nan Gong Ling said nodding his head.\u201cPatriarch, I was told to come over as an elder wanted to meet with me personally. I upon arrival immediately heard the Elder accuse me of various things, namely of being guilty of bringing shame upon the sects name and making the sect lose face. He called me the disgrace of the Sect and a piece of trash. When I try to provide an explanation to defend myself, he immediately calls me names and says I am contradicting him. Because I chose to defend my innocence he wants my arm to get cut off. I would like to ask. Isn\u2019t it Elder Mo, who made his decision based on his own personal opinion, guilty of bringing shame to the sect and causing it to lose face? As an Elder in charge of making sure that the rules are respected, isn\u2019t he supposed to represent the Sect in dealing out justice, rather than upholding his own biased injustice?\u201dLin Feng\u2019s sharp and precise words had shocked the entire crowd who now really believed he had gone insane.\u201cAudacious.\u201d a strong Qi had surrounded Lin Feng where he stood. Mo Xie hated Lin Feng so much that he wanted to kill him there on the spot before he could lose any more face to this young disciples words.\u201cI am not audacious. The Sect wants to abandon and expel me without finding the truth behind the accusations. Why not be audacious anyway? I would like to ask you Elder Mo, the crimes you accuse me of, who said I had committed them in the first place?\u201d Lin Feng was smiling and completely calm, he wasn\u2019t scared of confronting Mo Xie.\u201cYou Trash! You injure your own family members, you humiliate your elders. Do you not dare admit it?\u201d\u201d Lin Qian said in a cold tone.\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is\u2026 I see.\u201d said Lin Feng smiling. \u201cIt seems that the crimes Elder Mo accused me of came from her. It was my cousin who told you all of this, correct?\u201d\u201cYes, so what?\u201d said Mo Xie whose murderous intentions were becoming stronger and stronger in the depths of his heart. Even if Lin Qian and Chu Zhan Peng were not the ones to land the killing blow, they still wished for his death.\u201cHehe, since you admit it, Elder Mo, I would like to ask you a question in the presence of the Patriarch. You listened to her side of the story in order to accuse me of various crimes, but are you an Elder of the Yun Hai Sect or an Elder of the Hao Yue Sect?\u201d\u201cHow dare you! Daring to humiliate me, an esteemed Elder within the sect. I will cripple your cultivation now. Clear out the way. There is no more room for discussion.\u201d Mo Xie had come to the end of his patience. Allowing Lin Feng to talk that way about him had caused his brilliance and reputation as an Elder to be completely ruined.\u201cEverybody here knows what is right and what is wrong. It\u2019s just that I am not an Elite disciple within the sect, so I cannot defend myself. Only the strong were respected. If you want to cripple my cultivation, just do it, there is no need make up groundless fabricated charges against me. \u201d while Lin Feng said that, he didn\u2019t stop looking at Nan Gong Ling.If Nan Gong Ling prevented Mo Xie from attacking, Lin Feng would still be a Yun Hai Sect disciple in his heart even if he was expelled. However if Nan Gong Ling let him attack then Lin Feng would quickly tell them what had happened at the Precipice of Zhangu. Then during the confusion, Lin Feng would escape, as it could get dangerous for him and he wouldn\u2019t want to be a Yun Hai Sect disciple anymore anyway. If the Sect didn\u2019t want Lin Feng, why would he need the Sect? Lin Feng didn\u2019t have the least bit of servility in the depths of his heart and bones. He would never be any mans servant as long as he lived.Nan Gong Ling was carefully considering everything that had happened. Mo Xie was moving closer and preparing to swiftly attack Lin Feng.Nan Gong Ling was paying attention to Lin Feng\u2019s facial expression. He was staring at Lin Fen\u2019s completely calm eyes with intrigue.\u201cHis will and determination are extremely strong. He remains absolutely calm when facing danger. Besides, his natural abilities are good. He could join the Elite disciples in a few years. He could become a very important person within the sect and one day we may require talent such as his.\u201d\u201cMo Xie is an esteemed Elder. His achievements on the path of Cultivation are not insignificant. His natural talent and hard work also plays an important role in his development. He could climb up the hierarchy in the future. Even though what is happening today is Mo Xie\u2019s fault, he is an Elder after all and besides, he is Mo Cang Lan\u2019s son.\u201dNan Gong Ling was considering everything that had occurred and calculating his response at extremely quick speeds. He was the Patriarch of the Sect. Whatever problem there is, he must always distinguish things clearly and understand the advantages and disadvantages of doing something. If something can be of benefit to the Sect then it has to be done, if it is unfavorable for the Sect, then it shouldn\u2019t be done. This was the simple understanding which all patriarchs followed.He of course knew that Mo Xie had made a mistake concerning the ongoing problems. The problem was that if he stopped Mo Xie from acting, it would be the same as making him lose face. If he allowed him to attack, he would feel a great loss for the sect in his heart. Besides, he had no choice but to take into consideration Mo Cang Lan as well and couldn\u2019t make him lose face either. After all, Mo Cang Lan had the status of Great Elder within the Sect. He had rendered heroic services to the Sect.As a comparison, there was Lin Feng who certainly had some potential but he truly was an insignificant figure compared to the elders.Nan Gong Lin\u2019s hesitations made Lin Feng laugh at himself for ever believing in the sect. He laughed at his own ignorance. Even though he had defeated Hou Qing, one of the ten best Ordinary disciples, Lin Feng was still in everyone\u2019s eyes an Ordinary disciple, besides Mo Xie was an esteemed sect Elder. How could Nan Gong Ling make Mo Xie lose face because of Lin Feng? Lin Feng wasn\u2019t extremely strong so he shouldn\u2019t put himself in dangerous situations. In their minds it was Lin Feng\u2019s own fault for not being strong enough or having enough talent to be worth protecting.\u201cIgnorant child.\u201d Mo Xie said, as he was getting closer to Lin Feng. These words stabbed Lin Feng\u2019s eardrums. His smile revealed his murderous intentions, he wanted to kill Lin Feng. He was an Ordinary disciple, nothing more. Actually daring to oppose Mo Xie would be really reckless.\u201cLin Feng is dead!\u201d shouted disciples in the crowd. But Lin Feng could only blame his own powerlessness.\u201cWhat a pity that I can\u2019t cripple his cultivation myself.\u201d said Lin Qian while smiling coldly. It was quite an unexpected situation for Lin Qian but the result was the same, those were Lin Feng\u2019s last moments anyway.A strong and powerful energy was paralyzing Lin Feng. The hair all over his body was erected, he was about to open his mouth, but at that moment the force oppressing him all over his body disappeared without leaving trace.\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Feng was stunned. That was unexpected. How could that force suddenly vanish? Besides, how could it disappear that way without leaving trace?Mo Xie wasn\u2019t far from Lin Feng but at that moment he stopped walking towards Lin Feng. Mo Xie\u2019s pupils were dilated as if he had seen something unimaginable. Furthermore, a godly strength was oppressing Mo Xie\u2019s entire body.Many people didn\u2019t understand why Mo Xie had stopped. Nan Gong Ling as well as Mo Cang Lan were all astonished at these turn of events.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d Lin Feng was looking at Mo Xie\u2019s expression and then looked at his body. Lin Feng was as shocked as everyone else and could hardly believe what he was seeing.\u201cI\u2019m not mistaken\u2026\u201d Lin Feng was so shocked that his eyes couldn\u2019t be more open than at that moment. On Mo Xie\u2019s body, there was a shadow which looked like a human body. Besides, that shadow was moving even though Mo Xie was like paralyzed.It\u2019s a shadow. It really looked like exactly like a human\u2019s shadow.The scariest thing though was that Lin Feng could only see the shadow but couldn\u2019t see to whom it belonged.It wasn\u2019t only Lin Feng paying attention, the Patriarch as well as everyone was abnormally shocked and looking at the shadow enveloping Mo Xie\u2019s body.\u201cCome back, get lost you trash.\u201d said a voice which filled the entire area. Only the voice could be heard. Nobody could see who had said it, but the voice felt like it contained an immense power which shook everyone to their core.The voice which they had heard made many people start trembling in fear, many wanted to drop to their knees. That shadow which had come out of the void had scared everyone present and their bodies were begging to escape with an almost primal instinct.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 - A Strong HeartPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis is the second sponsored chapter for today. Special thanks to likyliky for bringing this chapter to us. As a bonus it is not a cliffhanger. I am not that evil!I hope you all enjoy the story and continue to support the work! Happy Reading, I hope I didn\u2019t make any mistakes in my sleepy daze. I will be popping off to bed shortly, so goodnight all, sweet dreams xoxoMo Xie Looked down and saw the dark shadow which was moving under his skin. It gave him an ice cold sensation which ran all the way down his spine. What sort of nightmarish thing is this to be moving under the skin of its victim? He could feel that he no longer had control of his own body.Mo Xie could barely move his body under the power of the shadow. He could feel that there was a man facing him and that that man was using his energy to paralyze him through the shadow but he couldn\u2019t detect where he was or who he was. It was as if he didn\u2019t exist.\u201cThat is actually him.\u201d Said Nan Gong Ling whose eyes were twinkling. He was stunned. He couldn\u2019t believe that the one controlling the shadow was actually inside Mo Xie\u2019s body. The shadow suddenly emerged from Mo Xie\u2019s back.\u201cMo Xie, come back.\u201d shouted Mo Cang Lan. He was one of the Great Elders of the Yun Hai Sect, how could he not be scared of what he had just witnessed. He was already sixty years old and had a broad knowledge about the techniques of cultivators within the world and knew of many types of spirits. He knew about the origin of the shadow and exactly how dangerous this situation was.\u201cIt is a shadow spirit. It\u2019s an extremely mysterious but dangerous kind of spirit. It is said that if a Cultivator has a shadow spirit and it awakens, that Cultivator would be able to penetrate into the body of others and take complete control of the bodily functions. Some powerful spirits can even stop a person from breathing while inside them, forcing them to suffocate without being able to defend themselves. The scariest part of a shadow cultivator was the fact that once inside your body, how would you attack them without causing damage to yourself. With each attack you may cause the shadow no damage but weaken your own defenses against the shadow.The shadow spirit could bring fear to even the most battle hardened cultivators. If the owner of a shadow spirit was evil and wanted to kill someone, it\u2019d be very easy for them to do so. Nobody wanted to offend the owner of a shadow spirit no matter what their level of cultivation. Mo Cang Lan definitely did not want his family to offend a shadow cultivator.Mo Xie took a few steps back while looking extremely pale. He was unable to do anything. He was so shocked by what had just happened to him, such a strong power completely consumed him.\u201cGreeting fellow cultivator, I don\u2019t know who you are or how we can assist you, but we will try. What brings you to us?\u201d Mo Cang Lan asked the shadow which was moving on the ground. He thought the person controlling the shadow was at the same place as the shadow.\u201cTake care of your Sect and not your own personal grudges, don\u2019t try to see where you can take advantage of other people within the sect and the members of the Sect will be able to keep their face.\u201d The voice echoed through the atmosphere again. With a gentle breeze, the shadow suddenly disappeared from sight completely.\u201cHow terrifying.\u201d Everyone in the crowd could feel their heart in their throat; at this point it was hard for anyone to take a breath. The Aura was so oppressive and the shadow spirit was terrifying.\u201cWho was that man? It briefly seemed like he was talking directly to the Patriarch.\u201d Discussions could be heard all around.\u201cIt must be someone who is guarding the Sect\u2019s best interests in secret. This is why he got involved because we were giving a disciple to another sect. The great Elders of the Sect surprisingly didn\u2019t know anything about this either. It seemed like a Yun Hai Sect had a hidden dragon.\u201dNan Gong Ling had a wry smile on his face. There was only one person who knew to whom the shadow belonged and it was him.When Nan Gong Ling thought of what he had done, he felt guilty. He weighed the pros and the cons of the different possibilities and took his position within the Sect very seriously. He always tried to do everything for the benefit of the Sect but had somehow forgotten the reputation of the Sect that time. He had worried about personal gains and losses too much, without considering the sect as a whole.\u201cChu Zhan Peng, let\u2019s finish for today. Please send your father my best regards.\u201d Said Nan Gong Ling while looking at Chu Zhan Peng.Finish for today? Lin Qian was stunned. How could she leave and let Lin Feng off?\u201cSenior please\u2026\u201d Lin Qian said in a low voice expressing anxiety. Chu Zhan Peng then smiled and said: \u201cPatriarch Nan Gong Ling, I came to Yun Hai Sect because I think you have many geniuses and heroic Cultivators within your sect. I really looked forward to seeing them. I don\u2019t know who, amongst all the disciples of the Sect, wants to practice with me. We could exchange pointers and it will definitely help us both gain insights.\u201dEven if Chu Zhan Peng\u2019s words sounded moderate and polite, he had no other choice but to talk that way. He wanted to provoke the Sect into fighting and losing face.Lin Feng understood everything perfectly, it all became very clear. He understood the reason why Lin Qian and the evil looking man had come to the Yun Hai Sect.\u201cJunior Patriarch Chu Zhan Peng, you are famous throughout the country, everyone knows your name. Our disciples in the Yun Hai Sect would have to practice very hard to engage in a balanced battle with you. If there is an opportunity at some point for a fight, I would be pleased to inform you and you could return at that time\u201d\u201cPatriarch Nan Gong Ling\u2026\u201d\u201cDo all of the Hao Yue Sect\u2019s disciples hold their life in no regard? It seems you would like me to repeat myself?\u201d said Nan Gong Ling in an extremely cold tone. Chu Zhan Peng still wanted to talk this matter over. Nan Gong Ling had already given him two hints that he wanted the two of them to leave. He had done his best not to make him lose face.Maybe Chu Zhan Peng had inherent skills and abilities but he was very proud and was making the patriarch of the Yun Hai Sect lose face. The Hao Yue Sect was stronger than the Yun Hai Sect but Nan Gong Ling was older and stronger than Chu Zhan Peng. Would he really dare make the patriarch lose face within their own territory?Chu Zhan Peng seemed extremely tense as he forced the words from his mouth and said, while smiling: \u201cAlright, I will take my leave.\u201dHis roc spirit flew away creating a hurricane-like wind behind. Chu Zhan Peng was holding Lin Qian as they were both riding the flying roc spirit. The hurricane-like wind created by the roc spirit was so strong that many people fell down. Everyone was confused at what had just happened.\u201cI, Chu Zhan Peng, will remember this.\u201d The legendary bird flew away high in the sky. Those who had fallen down got back on their feet. Everyone in the crowd was feeling depressed. Chu Zhan Peng had belittled them and their sect.\u201cLin Feng, during the annual meeting, I will kill you! Unless you plan to hide behind the Yun Hai Sect forever.\u201d Lin Qian said.Lin Feng looked at the flying roc. He had a cold smile deep within his heart. Did he need to hide in the Yun Hai Sect?Nan Gong Ling looked at the crowd on the ground. He had lost face but Chu Zhan Peng was too arrogant and nobody in the Sect could confront him openly.\u201cIn five years, I hope there will be someone in the Yun Hai Sect who has reached the same level on the path of Cultivation as Chu Zhan Peng.\u201d Said Nan Gong Ling. Even if Chu Zhan Peng was one of the officials within the Xue Yue Country, that didn\u2019t justify his arrogance. The Yun Hai Sect didn\u2019t know how powerful the other high officials of the country were, but they knew the incredibly strong cultivation of Chu Zhan Peng.\u201cLet\u2019s finish for today. Everybody, go back now.\u201d Nan Gong Ling waved and told the crowd to disperse and resume training.Mo Xie wasn\u2019t moving. He was looking at Lin Feng with pure hatred filling his eyes. Of course, Lin Feng would remember Elder Mo and would take his revenge.\u201cI said we\u2019re done for today.\u201d Shouted Nan Gong Ling loudly to Mo Xie who was still staring at Lin Feng. His voice made Mo Xie shiver. He then left and followed Nan Gong Ling.\u201cI must be careful and pay close attention to that guy from now on.\u201d Said Lin Feng to himself. He was so weak at this moment. He had a long way to go until he\u2019d reach Mo Xie\u2019s level on the path of Cultivation.Lin Feng was about to leave but then heard a voice.\u201cIf you want people to respect you, you have no choice but to become strong and powerful. Otherwise, you will be humiliated and even if you die, nobody will care.\u201dLin Feng stopped. These were Nan Gong Ling\u2019s words. Lin Feng had heard them and taken them to heart.\u201cOf course, I know.\u201d Lin Feng said and felt a certain warmth in his heart which made him smile in his thoughts. Lin Feng was on his way to become stronger.Lin Feng was sitting crossed-legged in the mountains, in a cave, meditating. The Qi of the heaven and earth turned into a white light which drowned into Lin Feng\u2019s body and was strengthening his bones while making his flesh more resilient.Cultivating and practicing. Lin Feng had been training so hard that you could clearly see his strength increasing by leaps and bounds. The Qi of heaven and earth had purified his blood and made his entire body stronger. That Qi had drowned into his body and been completely absorbed without wasting even the slightest amount. He was getting stronger with each passing moment.Qi layer, this was the first level of cultivation. A cultivator had only the basics at that level. It only made your basic Qi a bit stronger. Becoming stronger was only possible by cultivating more than anyone else and training harder than everyone else.Lin Feng was eager to improve his strength. He needed to become stronger than anyone. He was eager to break through to the Ling Qi layer. Only then would he be able to become an Elite disciple. Everybody would be forced to respect his power then.If he managed to break through to the Ling Qi layer, his spirit would awaken. With his spirits and his mastery, he would become a fearsome opponent.Exactly like Chu Zhan Peng and Lin Qian whose spirits had awakened. Chu Zhan Peng could fly high in the sky and carry people on the back of his spirit. Lin Qian could control ice and fire by using her universal spirit.Lin Feng trusted that if his strength and power increased, his spirit would awaken and with his spirit he could increase his strength many times.Therefore, once Han Man recovered from his injuries completely, Lin Feng would go into closed door training within one of the eight mountains and cultivate hoping to break through to the Ling Qi layer as quickly as possible. He has understood that he would need to increase his strength or he would not be respected in this world.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25 - The power within the Ling Qi layerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySorry for the late chapter. This is the regular release from Monday. I had half translated the content yesterday but I have been extremely sick. It appears I may have pushed myself too hard during the weekend along with meeting a friend who had just got over a virus, was probably not the best idea. I am slowly recovering in my PJs and I look a complete mess!!I hope you all enjoy this Chapter. Please let me know if I made any mistakes in my poorly state and I will fix them. I will be back at full power soon, good news is I can get some extra translating done when I feel better xoxoTen days later, Lin Feng\u2019s Qi had become much stronger. There was a brilliant milky white aura around him as he sat meditating.Outside his training cave there were two silhouettes in the distance who were getting closer and closer to the cave in which Lin Feng was cultivating.\u201cThis is such a nice place. It\u2019s so peaceful and quiet. This place would be extremely beneficial to our cultivation.\u201d Said the young man who saw the cave. He couldn\u2019t help himself but smile radiantly.\u201cXue Er, should we practice here?\u201d\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to practice.\u201d Said the girl standing next to him who was radiating sex appeal. She was wearing a skintight red robe which looked like a gentle fire was hugging all of her curves, she was extremely attractive.\u201cHehe, when I\u2019m with the incredibly beautiful Xue Er and have such beautiful scenery around, then wouldn\u2019t it be more fun to press you between my legs rather than do something boring like training?\u201d The young man was incredibly thin and pale, he didn\u2019t look like a Cultivator.The girl wearing the tight red robes looked at the young man with a hint of disdain. She didn\u2019t refuse the opportunity to train though. Cultivators required extremely large amounts of money when training because to have access to weapons and profound pills of high quality, it would require extremely large sums of money. If you were born from an ordinary family and didn\u2019t dare to go hunt and kill some ferocious wild beasts, it was impossible for you to receive the help of such treasures. The girl who was wearing the skin tight red robe could be seen with a glance to not have much talent and her family was probably commoners or of very low status. Because she wanted to improve quickly on the patch of Cultivation, she stuck together with the thin young guy, no matter how unpleasant it was.Lu Fei was eighteen years old and had reached the ninth Qi layer. He could borrow the forces from the elements and was naturally talented. His status was also secured by his brother, Lu Liang, who was an Elite disciple of the sect. Therefore the young girl, Xue Huan would have sexual relations with Lu Fei so that she could get some profound pills for training and at the same time could enjoy carnal pleasures.When they entered the cave, they saw Lin Feng sitting in a meditative position and cultivating. They looked at each other with a confused look. They would never have thought that this cave far away from the view of others would be occupied for training.\u201cIt seems like we have to find another place.\u201d Xue Huan said with regret.\u201cFind another place? Why? I can tell he is at the eighth Qi layer. I will make him go somewhere else to train.\u201d Said Lu Fei shaking his head.\u201cIt\u2019s not good to disturb others training\u201d Said Xue Huan politely smiling.\u201cChill out, that guy\u2019s strength is low, he\u2019s weak. Wait here, I\u2019ll go cripple his cultivation for ruining the mood before I throw him out of here.\u201d Said Lu Fei with an evil smile on his face. There were some strong Cultivators who would attack weak Cultivators practicing in caves for no other reason than causing them a minor irritation. It was a risky thing to do though, because if these weak Cultivators became strong, they would seek revenge, so even some cruel Cultivators didn\u2019t dare and do it. Those who still did these types of attacks would cruelly cripple the opponent\u2019s cultivation to stop any chances of revenge.\u201cHehe\u201d Xue Huan giggled and just nodded without saying anything. She agreed because people who went to caves were very few and a cave was really a great place to practice. Only the strong could use those benefits.\u201cLittle boy, wake up.\u201d Said Lu Fei in a cold mocking tone while sensing Lin Feng\u2019s Qi.Lin Feng opened his eyes. There was an incredibly cold killing intent which filled the cave. He had been woken up by Lu Fei and Xue Huan when they had come into the cave but he thought they would leave without bothering his training. It seemed like his thoughts were a bit too simplistic, these people\u2019s intentions were worse than what he could imagine. He had heard them discussing what their intentions were.\u201cYou want to kick me out and cripple my cultivation?\u201d asked Lin Feng coldly.\u201cIf you heard what I said, then get moving and cripple your cultivation yourself, If you do it yourself it will be less painful.\u201d Said Lu Fei.\u201cVery good.\u201d Said Lin Feng nodding. He stood up right after and slowly walked towards Lu Fei.\u201cYou haven\u2019t crippled your own cultivation and you think you can just walk away?\u201d said Lu Fei smiling coldly to Lin Feng who was about to leave.\u201cDid I ever say that I was planning to leave?\u201d said Lin Feng with a teasing expression on his face. He suddenly stamped on the ground which made the entire cave shake. Right after, Lin Feng flew out of the cave at incredible speed directly at Lu Fei.\u201cHuh?\u201d Lu Fei frowned. As he had suddenly seen the fist that was flying towards him.\u201cBOOOM!\u201d\u201cAhhhh\u201dLu Fei\u2019s arm broke into pieces and was hanging loosely from his shoulder. A devilish hand appeared around his neck and lifted him off the ground.\u201cI want to ask you, how did you intend to cripple my cultivation?\u201d asked Lin Feng looking at Lu Fei. His body was emitting a cold and deathly Qi. Xue Huan looked pale, she had never expected Lin Feng to be this strong.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was wrong, I didn\u2019t know you were so strong, let me go please, I will just leave peacefully.\u201d Lu Fei grabbed Lin Feng\u2019s arm with his hand, he was trying to make Lin Feng let go of his neck. His voice was shaky and he was struggling to breathe.\u201cDo you think that saying you know you were wrong is enough?\u201d Lu Fei thought he was the stronger cultivator at the beginning. He wanted to cripple Lin Feng\u2019s cultivation and then force him from the training cave so he could do immoral acts with the young girl. At that moment he knew he couldn\u2019t escape, saying that he knew he was wrong, would it really be enough? That would be too easy. If Lin Feng had indeed been weaker than Lu Fei, Lu Fei would have already crippled his cultivation.\u201cIf you want to cripple other people\u2019s cultivation, you must take into consideration that they may be able to cripple yours as well.\u201d Said Lin Feng punching Lu Fei dantian with incredible force, which made him shoot through the air and land heavily on the ground several meters away.Lin Feng then looked at Xue Huan standing on the other side and shouted at her: \u201cGet lost!\u201dXue Huan was shaking a little. She ran out towards Lu Fei and helped him leave the cave together with her.\u201cYou dare to cripple my cultivation, I can only be satisfied with your death.\u201d Shouted a voice outside of the cave. Lin Feng ignored the shouts and kept practicing.But then, shortly after, he was interrupted again. Lu Fei and Huan Xue had come back and this time, they had brought another disciple with them.This disciple seemed to be nineteen years old. He resembled Lu Fei a bit but his face looked like that of an eagle. He looked even more evil than Lu Fei.\u201cBro, that bastard broke my arm. He also crippled my cultivation. Go and kill him for me.\u201d Lu Fei said as his face was twisted in anger like an demon.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will cripple his cultivation, break both his arms and legs, which will be your revenge.\u201d Lu Lian said while staring at Lin Feng which gave him the feeling that a fierce animal was gazing at him.\u201cAlright.\u201d Said Lu Fei while nodding.Lin Feng frowned. Even though Lu Liang hadn\u2019t shown his Qi yet, Lin Feng could feel, by looking at Lu Liang\u2019s eyes, that he was much stronger than Lu Fei, and even stronger than Jing Hao who was ranked sixth within the ordinary disciples.\u201cYou dared cripple my brother\u2019s cultivation, I will show you how terrible the consequences are.\u201d Said Lu Lian to Lin Feng.Lin Feng said nothing and took a few steps forward, the energy in his entire body suddenly changed and became oppressively powerful.The entire atmosphere around them began to fill with insanely strong waves of energy. Lin Feng had used his Nine Heavy Waves which made the entire space around them vibrate. The air around them began to howl with the power emitted by these waves. Lin Feng, who was at the eighth Qi layer, could use his Nine Heavy Waves to increase the power of his strikes and they could emit strength beyond 9000 jin. It could even reach 9500 jin at times. Each of his attacks would be extremely powerful.\u201cYou intentionally hide your skills as a cultivator to target those weaker and you even crippled my brother\u2019s cultivation, but your strength is still not enough to fight against me.\u201dWhen Lu Liang felt Lin Feng\u2019s power, he thought that he was actually at the ninth Qi layer. He had thought that it was due to his brother\u2019s ignorance. His brother enjoyed that young girl\u2019s presence and had offended a strong cultivator while he was training.A blood curdling shout suddenly burst through the atmosphere. Lu Liang was the one that had shouted. It didn\u2019t sound like a sound a human could make at all. It sounded like the howl of an extremely violent ferocious beast.Lu Liang had transformed his hand into claws and his Qi was turning into demonic Qi.As Nine Heavy Waves touched the claw, Lin Feng immediately retreated and looked at his own hand, his skin was ripped off and there was blood. His hand in that brief encounter had become extremely painful.\u201cLing Qi layer\u201d said Lin Feng while looking at Lu Liang. Lin Feng could already carry out attacks with the strength of 9500 jin but Lu Liang could stop them. Lin Feng knew that his opponent had already surpassed the original Qi layer of strength.\u201cYou\u2019re finally regretting what you\u2019ve done now, what a pity\u2026 It\u2019s already too late.\u201d Said Lu Liang mockingly. He didn\u2019t deny that he had already reached the Ling Qi layer. He actually had reached this level of strength a few months before. He was extremely strong. When releasing his Qi outside of his body, he could greatly increase his power. A cultivator of the Qi layer had no chance against a Cultivator of the Ling Qi layer.\u201cI regret indeed. I regret that I didn\u2019t kill Lu Fei a moment ago and spared his pathetic little life.\u201d Lin Feng said while unsheathing his long sword from his back. He started moving extremely quickly using his Moonlight Feather Agility. It was better to fight than die while cowering.Thunderous roars started spreading throughout the atmosphere of the mountain. Lin Feng\u2019s long sword started to glow with a radiant light and thrust towards Lu Liang, about to stab him.Lu Liang couldn\u2019t avoid the attack. His claws like hooks immediately faced the sword and grabbed it before it could stab through his body. The collision between Lin Feng\u2019s long sword and Lu Liang\u2019s claws created an explosion of power. Lin Feng\u2019s sword was pushed slightly aside.\u201cRoaring Thunder!\u201d shouted Lin Feng. His sword emitted a whistling sound and then a rumbling noise. When Lu Liang\u2019s claws touched Ling Feng\u2019s sword, Lu Liang felt a strong and violent power resembling the power of a storm.\u201cWhoosh\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s long sword looked like the wind. The sound of the sword coupled with the sound of the thunderous roars was extremely terrifying to the onlookers.\u201cBooom.\u201dA strong force was emitted. Lu Liang suddenly released his spirit, it was a mighty eagle spirit which fell within the category of beast spirits. The eagle spirit was an extremely violent and wild spirit. Chu Zhan Peng\u2019s roc spirit had more magnificence than the eagle spirit.The sound of the eagle was heard. Lu Liang\u2019s claws were glowing. The light that was glowing on his claws became a single streak of light and enveloped Lin Feng\u2019s long sword in a flash.\u201cYou cannot compete with someone of the Ling Qi layer with your level of strength.\u201d Said Lu Liang who eyes were twinkling. He felt threatened by Lin Feng which is why he had released his spirit.Since Lin Feng had passed the exam of the Precipice of Zhangu, his Roaring Thunder was even stronger than previously. Even though Lin Feng was only at the eighth Qi layer, he was as strong as other Cultivators of the ninth Qi layer thanks to his skillful attacks. He had really mastered all of his skills.But when Lu Liang released his eagle spirit, he became much stronger and could block Lin Feng\u2019s sword attacks using the Qi from his claws.But could someone of the Qi layer really not fight against someone of the Ling Qi layer? Lin Feng didn\u2019t think so and he was certainly going to risk his life to find out.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 - You Again!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHere is wednesdays regular release. I will also be releasing a sponsored chapter later today. Thank you for everyone who wished me well when I was sick. I came on and the comments made me feel much better! I however was still horribly sick which did not magically recover as I had hoped. Thank you again, the comments did make me feel better.I hope you enjoy this chapter xoxo more to come later todayLin Feng was only at the eighth Qi layer but Lu Liang still perceived Lin Feng as a threat. Lin Feng was absolutely convinced that if he had reached the ninth Qi layer then this would be a completely balanced fight between them.\u201cNine Heavy Waves.\u201d The atmosphere filled with an oppressive aura as the waves poured from Lin Feng\u2019s fist. The colossal shock waves surged towards Lu Liang.\u201cFracturing Claws!\u201d Lu Liang lifted up his hand, his fingers were now claws which looked like razor sharp hooks. Suddenly, a strong Qi burst forth from his body and dominated the atmosphere within the mountains. The powerful waves vanished like smoke with no resistance.\u201cRoaring Thunder!\u201d Lin Feng thrust his sword towards Lu Liang. Every one of Lin Feng\u2019s movements would disturb the atmosphere with vibrations. Even his long sword which had been carefully stopped between Lu Liang\u2019s claws was vibrating with power. Lin Feng was becoming more of a problem over time. Lu Liang had the feeling of numbness coming from his hand, so he had no choice but to let go of Lin Feng\u2019s sword.But when Lu Liang let go of Lin Feng\u2019s long sword, he thrust his claws directly towards the unsuspecting Lin Feng. Lin Feng could sense the change in power and felt the initial shockwave which made him groan with pain as he was sent flying with the power from the strike.Lu Liang had an eagle spirit. He had a sharp and precise destructive power; this was his main strength. Physical strength was secondary to him but his attacks could still reach the strength of 10 000 jin which represented a superhuman physical strength.Lin Feng doubted in his mind, he was not sure if he could win this fight. The difference between the eighth Qi layer and the Ling Qi layer was too big. There was a huge gap between the Qi layer and the Ling Qi layer. Fighting someone of the Ling Qi layer when at the Qi layer was a gap in power that could not be crossed with technique alone. Lin Feng really wanted to defeat Lu Liang but that was unrealistic.\u201cRoaring Thunder.\u201d Lin Feng wielded his sword to strike out again. Lin Feng didn\u2019t take the initiative to attack though.\u201cWoosh\u201d\u201cSwish\u201d\u201cWoosh\u201d\u201cSwish\u201dSword strikes one after the other, Lin Feng was striking repeatedly in the air around him. Endless thunderous roars could be heard from the air around him. The entire cave was full of thunderous roars as if the God of Thunder had gone on a rampage within this mountain.In the short amount of time it took Lin Feng to deliver these multiple strikes, Lin Feng\u2019s body was surrounded by an aura of Qi which filled the air. He was enveloped in the devastating Qi from his sword looking like a bubble surrounding him.\u201cDefense? You still think you can defend? I will take this opportunity to show you how laughable your defense will be against attacks from an opponent at Ling Qi Layer.\u201d Said Lu Liang while laughing. The wings of the eagle spirit started to move and the eagle threw itself in Lin Feng\u2019s direction. A powerful Qi collided into the energy bubble made completely from sword Qi.\u201cBOOOM!\u201dLin Feng who was enveloped in the Sword Qi felt that he was sitting in a small boat which carefully floated upon a large ocean. Currently his boat was not tranquil and was being tossed back and forth from a gigantic storm which had invaded his large ocean. The opponent\u2019s Qi was bombarding the Qi bubble from every direction making it hard for the bubble to completely protect him from every strike. His body had received some damage from the strikes which had passed the Qi Bubble. However, the ocean of Qi still looked as calm and graceful as ever.\u201cSoaring Eagle\u201dLu Liang saw that the Qi from his claws had almost no effect on Lin Feng. Lu Liang crouched down and both his hands transformed his Qi into eagles which flew up in the air then begun to soar downwards directly towards Lin Feng inside the Qi bubble. The Qi eagles soared down into Lu Liang\u2019s claws which struck out at Lin Feng.\u201cBOOOM\u201dThe shockwave from this attack caused the sword Qi around Lin Feng to shake violently. Lin Feng\u2019s body also shook a little bit before he could fully stabilize himself, The Qi bubble had stabilized again and Lin Feng returned to his motionless state.When Lu Liang saw that he couldn\u2019t carry out any efficient attack on a Cultivator who had yet to pass into the Ling Qi Layer, he went into a frenzy of madness. His entire body turned into an eagle and he began to wildly attack in the direction of Lin Feng.Lin Feng was enduring stronger and stronger attacks. Lu Liang\u2019s power in his wild fury was growing stronger with his fury. The entire cave was full of thunderous roars which were being emitted by the sword Qi surrounding Lin Feng. Rocks had started to fall from the cave roof then explode from the pressure which gave the impression that the cave was ready to collapse at any moment.Lin Feng had blood dripping from the corner of his mouth. All of Lu Liang\u2019s attacks were now releasing strength no less than 12,000 jin. His attacks followed an irregular pattern as he was just striking wildly, making it hard to correctly dodge incoming attacks. Lin Feng\u2019s body was growing more and more damaged as he continued to endure the relentless attacks.\u201cI should finish this.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s eyes were cold. He gently moved his long sword slowly through the air which released an invisible pressure. An incredible amount of sword Qi was moving from the atmosphere towards his sword. Incredibly powerful thunderous roars were being unleashed with only a slow and gentle movement of his sword.Sword Force, The natural energy of the sword had surrounded him. This is the true power of Roaring Thunder which can annihilate anything in its path!A truly devastating force was being emitted from Lin Feng\u2019s sword the whole atmosphere was consumed by the presence of his sword. Lu Liang was aware that an incredible power was moving closer to him, his eagle spirit was shaking and immediately began to retreat. The Sword force was so violent that the eagle spirit had retreated in a flash.Lin Feng didn\u2019t stop moving his sword which was gathering more and more sword Qi Inside. He started using his Moonlight Feather Agility technique to approach the retreating Lu Liang. Terrifying thunderous roars were coming from Lin Feng\u2019s sword and bombarded Lu Liang.\u201cSoaring Eagle.\u201d Shouted Lu Liang while his two hands unleashed Qi which once again turned into two eagles which rose into the air. The Qi combining again into his claws was incomparably powerful.\u201cBOOOOOOOOM!\u201d A terrifying explosion of power filled the cave completely. The entire cave was trembling.\u201cMoonlight Feather Agility!\u201dLin Feng\u2019s entire body transformed into a ray of moonlight, illuminating the entire cave. As he moved towards the exit of the cave, his sword flashed out.\u201cAAAAAAAAHHHHHH\u201d A horrible shriek filled the air.\u201cBASTARD!\u201d shouted Lu Liang in a thundering rage, whose arms were completely drenched with blood. He had been severely injured by taking Lin Feng\u2019s attack. If Lu Liang had not moved back at the moment of the attack, he may have lost his life.Lu Liang would have never thought that a guy of the eighth Qi layer could fight him, injure him and on top of that\u2026 kill his own brother right in front of him.Lu Liang hugged his brother\u2019s dying body. His expression was savage and his face was completely twisted with grief and anger. At that moment he truly looked like a demon. There was a massive amount of blood flowing out of Lu Fei\u2019s throat. He had already taken his last breath.Lin Feng had managed to slit his throat during his escape from the cave. It was Lin Feng\u2019s revenge masterpiece.\u201cAs long as I, Lu Liang, am alive in this world, you will never have peace.\u201d Lu Liang\u2019s voice resonated in the cave and sounded like it came from a demon locked in hell. Xue Huan was terrified and was shivering in fear. She was leaning against the wall of the cave as she no longer had the strength to stand by herself. She had also never thought that Lin Feng\u2019s strength would be so powerful that even Lu Liang would end up in such a miserable state.If Lin Feng had heard Lu Liang\u2019s shouts, he would have a sarcastic smile on his face from the result of his masterpiece. Lu Liang would chase him forever and he would never have peace. Why would he need to say such useless words. If he chased him forever then he would suffer the same fate as his brother.Lin Feng was no longer generous enough to let a person leave with their life a second time. This was the deal he had already made clear. Yet Lu Fei still came back for revenge. He would only let Lu Fei keep his life once.Lin Feng wasn\u2019t the kind of person who was evil. He would never take the initiative to go and provoke others. He didn\u2019t frequently kill other people if he didn\u2019t need to, but if others provoked him and tried to kill him, he obviously protected himself and resisted.Lin Feng ran for half an hour and gradually slowed down. He coughed up blood that he had been restraining since the fight. Lin Feng was also injured heavily in the fight and was actually at a larger disadvantage, if the fight continued he would have lost his life. This is why he left a distraction behind for his opponent and left while pretending to be unharmed. After all, there was a huge level difference between his opponent and him. He was only at the eighth Qi layer and had fought against a Cultivator of the Ling Qi layer\u2026 that fight\u2026 he was proud of himself.He took out the jar filled with profound healing pills. He took out a healing pill, put it in his mouth and swallowed it immediately. A refreshing and comfortable sensation spread throughout his body. He had the feeling that his thoughts which had become slow, suddenly became clear and quick again. He could think clearly and quickly again, he felt refreshed. In an instant, his wounds were all cured.\u201cWhat an efficient profound pill!.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s eyes revealed how pleasantly surprised he was. No wonder Protector Kong had said that one was enough to cure Han Man. Lin Feng had found it suspicious as he did not believe he could easily receive a jar of pills which were such high quality. He had given three pills at once to Han Man and he had even given three more pills to Jing Yun in case they were not enough. Where there is precaution, there is no danger, but at that moment Lin Feng understood how powerful and rare these profound pills really were.Not only did Lin Feng have the feeling his injuries were completely recovered but he also had the feeling that his strength had once again greatly improved.\u201cNo wonder so many Cultivators want to use profound pills, they are extremely powerful. Even healing pills have such a great benefit to cultivation.\u201dIn the Continent of the Nine Clouds, many Cultivators concocted profound pills and fabricated weapons. The ones who could concoct profound pills and create weapons were extremely respected as they were masters amongst masters. They had a very high status in society as it was rare to find someone talented in these fields of expertise. There were people who concocted healing pills within the Yun Hai Sect as well, but because Lin Feng was only an ordinary disciple, he still hadn\u2019t had the opportunity to come into contact any of these masters.Engaging in battles is the best way to improve on the path of Cultivation as it is not artificially created by an outside power. These profound pills were just an aid that had to be used alongside struggles within battle. Lin Feng had obviously gone through a lot of hardships on the path of Cultivation already. He now had to find another good place to practice and consolidate his knowledge from this battle. This could be the opportunity to break through to the ninth Qi layer. After breaking through to the ninth Qi layer, he would go back to Yangzhou City and attend the annual meeting with his cousin.Lin Feng turned around and looked at the landscape. It looked surprisingly familiar.\u201cIt was here originally.\u201d Thought Lin Feng with shiny eyes. He immediately gazed into the distance and smiled.He could see two mountains in the distance which seemed to have been split open by a sword. These were the mountains where he had seen the sunlight passing through the mountain\u2026 but had run into a ruthless girl there.\u201cI found such a nice cave to practice. I wouldn\u2019t have thought that there were such nice places around here. I guess I will have to make it my own.\u201d Lin Feng obviously wasn\u2019t going to forget that that girl had tried to kill him twice. This time, he was going to see if her attacks could even reach a hair on his body.Lin Feng walked quicker and quicker towards the mountain cave. He then arrived and entered without hesitating whatsoever.When Lin Feng entered the cave out from which the sunlight was shining through, some people saw him and couldn\u2019t help but be stupefied at such a spectacle. They stayed outside to watch Lin Feng be forced from within the cave. That disciple dared get into fellow disciple Liu Fei\u2019s restricted area without permission. He really was acting recklessly. As long as he did not act foolishly when inside then he would be forced outside and beaten for his crime.A short instant later, Lin Feng had entered into the open area inside the mountain again. He was standing in front of the hot spring. There were still many caves there. If there was nobody to disturb, those were really perfect for cultivation.At that moment, just like last time, Liu Fei\u2019s was under the water of the hot spring cultivating, her head was beneath the water making it only possible to see her upon inspection. Her eyes were closed and she was holding her breath to cultivate. That way of practicing was a great way to improve one\u2019s breathing techniques. By improving her breathing technique, Liu Fei could shoot multiple arrows in a single breath. The power of her arrows would also be stronger and more powerful.Lin Feng did not recklessly jump in this time. He was waiting for her to resurface.When her beautiful face appeared on the surface of the water, Liu Fei saw Lin Feng standing there. She couldn\u2019t help but be surprised. She immediately narrowed her eyes with a hint of anger. She said in an ice cold tone: \u201cYou again.\u201d\u201cIndeed, it\u2019s me again.\u201d Said Lin Feng with a cold tone hidden in his voice. After having fought against a Cultivator of the Ling Qi layer, he felt he had enough power to engage in a battle with Liu Fei. Even though Liu Fei one of the best Ordinary disciples, Lin Feng felt confident. After all, Lin Feng was not as strong that Jing Hao and he had defeated Jing Hao. However their fighting styles were different and he had to be careful.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I feel so happy to benefit such a great community of people. Thank you for all the support xoxoEnjoy!\u201cThere are certain people in the world who are perverts, some are degenerates and there are others who are not serious about practicing the art of cultivation. The only thing they have in common is their filthy and perverted thoughts.\u201d Thought Liu Fei as she saw that Lin Feng was looking at her while laughing.\u201cI need to ask, how many lives do you have to act so foolishly?\u201d she asked with a hint of anger.Liu Fei while talking had quickly sprung from the hot spring. Her clothes were completely soaked with water again and became skin tight, revealing all of her hidden curves. She was extremely attractive, she was as delicate as a swan. If it had been Lin Feng\u2019s previous world then many people would be absolutely crazy about her and dedicate themselves to worshipping her.But this was not that world, this was not the old Lin Feng. His heart wasn\u2019t that of an ordinary person any longer. When looking at Liu Fei, he felt cold and detached, his heart was as unmoving as stone.\u201cI would have never thought she would confuse me for a pervert and take all of my actions as an attempt to take advantage of her.\u201d Thought Lin Feng but he remained completely calm. If Liu Fei thought he was a pervert, he would teach her a lesson. An evil smile slowly crept onto his face as he was staring at her.Liu Fei saw that Lin Feng\u2019s face had perverted intentions and she could not suppress her anger. She was already getting ready to shoot an arrow through his heart and kill him.\u201cYou really are looking for trouble, do not blame me for being heartless.\u201dThe sound of her arrow cut through the air with a whistling noise. Her arrow was surrounded by a sparkling light and created a small explosion when colliding with Lin Feng\u2019s Heavy Waves.\u201cShe has gotten much stronger since the last time we met.\u201d Thought Lin Feng. He used his Nine Heavy Waves to retaliate against her arrow. The vibrations of the waves spread throughout the atmosphere around them and the arrow immediately crashed into the ground.Lin Feng\u2019s Nine Heavy Waves was much stronger than before and he had increased his skill with using it in battle by leaps and bounds. So it was easy for him to stop Liu Fei\u2019s arrow with his current strength. His Nine Heavy Waves had a strength far superior to 9,000 jin.\u201cNo wonder you dared to come back. But do you really think you are strong enough to attempt perverted things with me?\u201dLiu Fei released her arrow spirit. It automatically targeted Lin Feng. Liu Fei took an arrow out, put it in her bow and slowly pulled her bowstring with all of her strength. The sound of the bowstring vibrating under the pressure could be heard.\u201cGo.\u201dHer arrow was much faster and contained a great deal more power than her previous arrow.Lin Feng angrily groaned as this battle was already more difficult than he had hoped. He took a small step and used his Nine Heavy Waves on the incoming arrow. The power of the waves unleashed was terrifying.The arrow was blocked by the waves but the arrow had pierced all the way through to his fist, leaving his hand feeling slightly numb. While the arrow had stopped his fist still contained some power which showed that his attacks contained slightly more power than the arrow.\u201cHuh?\u201d Liu Fei frowned. That pervert has made huge progress in such a small period of time.Liu Fei shot another arrow which was filled with all her killing intent.\u201cYou think that only you can attack in a fight?\u201d Lin Feng said while smiling coldly. Lin Feng used his Moonlight Feather Agility and approached Liu Fei at an incredible speed. The moment when the arrow was about to strike him, a flash of light appeared before the arrow and as he sheathed his sword, the arrow split into two.Liu Fei was staring in complete shock. Lin Feng had progressed much too fast. He cut her arrows in mid air while still approaching her at incredible speed. His movement speed and ability to cut down her arrows was simply too fast. She had not seen him unsheathe his sword and only saw the moment he had begun to sheath his sword again.Liu Fei seemed quickly stepped back and made sure to keep the distance between her and Lin Feng. She then took out three arrows at once.\u201cThree arrows at once. The strength of the attack will exceed 9500 jin. Show me how you intend to block such an attack.\u201d Said Liu Fei silently to herself. She took a deep breath and simultaneously shot the three arrows directly towards Lin Feng.\u201cPRRRRRROOOOMMMMMM\u201d Lin Feng immediately unsheathed his long sword and the sound of thunderous roars could be heard with each movement of his sword. The arrows could not even get close to Lin Feng before being completely repelled by the Qi released from his sword.Roaring Thunder combined with his knowledge of sword Qi, Lin Feng\u2019s sword alone was stronger than the arrows but when combined with the sword Qi within the atmosphere, he wielded such a terrifying amount of power. The sword had blocked the three arrows with just the light of his sword Qi.\u201cHow\u2019s that even possible?\u201d Liu Fei\u2019s eyes stared at the scene in shock. With her current level of strength, she could only shoot three arrows at once. That was her absolute maximum power. If she used five arrows at once then the power of her attack could only reach 9000 jin, this was an attack which sacrificed the power of each arrow to increase the number of arrows for use in a group fight. In a one on one battle it could only display slightly less power than shooting the three arrows at once.But Lin Feng could break three arrows before they were able to get close.She looked at Lin Feng and suddenly a smile appeared on her face. She made sure to keep the distance between them the same as when the battle first started. Liu Fei suddenly shot three arrows towards Lin Feng again.The result was exactly the same as the first time she used this attack. Lin Feng broke the arrows in one hit using his sword Qi which was still glowing in the air around his sword.Before she even had time to attack again, Lin Feng\u2019s sword was approaching Liu Fei\u2019s throat and she had got lost in her own thoughts. She remembered when Lin Feng appeared in here for the first time, when he could hardly withstand a single arrow from her. The second time she had met him in the Stormy Gorge, it seemed like he had made more progress with his strength and had even wanted to kill her. This time was the third time, however this time it was her who could not even take a single attack from Lin Feng.\u201cHow is this possible? How could he progress at such speed?\u201dLiu Fei felt satisfied with her own training speed and thought she was extremely talents compared to others around her. She constantly improved her skills and cultivation on a daily basis. The power of Lin Feng\u2019s attack was just too powerful, she could not even defend herself against it. Then suddenly his sword stopped right before piercing the delicate skin on her throat.Lin Feng had a smile on his face and he gave the impression he was looking at something worthless which could be used and thrown away. When Liu Fei saw his face, her whole body froze from head to toe with fear.\u201cWhat do you intend to do to me?\u201dLiu Fei stared at Lin Feng and bit her down on her soft lips. She could only endure her fate.Lin Feng glanced at Liu Fei who was soaking wet. Her body was tightly hugged by her wet robes and her curves were captivating. She could send any man into a frenzy of desire\u2026 Lin Feng let out a deep sigh filled with emotion. This girl was extraordinarily beautiful but she was too violent and her heart was merciless.Lin Feng looked longingly at the curves of Liu Fei\u2019s attractive body and let out a groan.Then with a smile of indifference as if he way toying with her, he said: \u201cDon\u2019t think too highly of yourself! I\u2019m not interested in someone like you at all. Get lost, I am going to train\u201dLin Feng stopped talking and started to sheathe his sword. Without even glancing back he headed towards one of the caves to train. He had wanted to kill her but the look on her face showed that she had truly believed with all of her heart that Lin Feng had always held perverted intentions. He could not justify killing her over the misunderstanding when they met. Next time however he would not be so generous.Liu Fei was stunned as she watched Lin Feng. She bit her pink lips so hard that her lips had started to bleed.Liu Fei was sixteen years old and had reached the ninth Qi layer. She could use her bow very skillfully and combined with her arrow spirit, her attacks were extremely powerful. Within the Yun Hai Sect, there were no ordinary disciples who dared fight with her. She had strong natural abilities and was extremely skillful with her techniques.Additionally, she had a very beautiful face. Everyone in the Yun Hai Sect was aware of her, to the extent that of the people who were seeking her affection, elite disciples were amongst the lowest in ranking. Therefore, she had thought that Lin Feng was a pervert like many others that she had come across in the past because of her beauty. Why else would he strip down and then jump into the hot spring where she was training? She then realized that the whole time she had been giving herself airs.On that day, not only had Lin Feng humiliated her in a contest of strength but he had also hurt her ego and self respect.\u201cDon\u2019t think too highly of yourself!\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s cold, disdainful and detached words had profoundly hurt her feelings.\u201cNext time, I will show him.\u201d Thought Liu Fei. However, she didn\u2019t leave. She jumped into the hot spring again and started to practice her breathing techniques under water. This was the best place to improve her shooting abilities and develop the power of her arrow spirit in the quickest possible time.Lin Feng went into a huge cave.In this cave which went deep into the mountain, there was a stone bed and a clean set of robes. Liu Fei had obviously been practicing here.\u201cThat woman really had chosen a nice place to train.\u201d Lin Feng was satisfied with the cave. In the Yun Hai Sect\u2019s history the new disciples would use the training grounds of the previous eras. These caves had been made by the ancestors of the sect. Their children and grandchildren had used these caves and they were still being used. They belonged to every member of the Yun Hai Sect. The caves belonged to nobody, only with enough strength could you secure a training location. In some cases people would steal valuable items or materials from the cave. This showed how amazing these training areas were for disciples.Lin Feng sat on the stone bed and released his dark spirit. If someone came in, Lin Feng could immediately sense their presence and hide his spirit.Lin Feng entered into a state of meditation. The Qi of the Heaven and Earth had begun to invade his body from the atmosphere around him. Lin Feng immediately started to practice intensely.A short time passed.The Qi of heaven and earth became restless and begun to form a whirlpool. A radiant white light appeared and penetrated into Lin Feng\u2019s dantian.When Lin Feng opened his eyes, he had a remarkable light in his eyes and was grinning from ear to ear.\u201cI have broken through to the ninth Qi layer. Now there should be no one I have left to fear beneath the Ling Qi layer.\u201dWhen Lin Feng was at the eighth Qi layer, he could already fight against someone of the Ling Qi layer but in his battle he had been severely injured and if he had not escaped after the clash from their power, he would have most likely lost his life. Cultivators who had reached the Ling Qi layer had an incredible strength and many of them had already awakened their spirits which made them incredibly strong. Lu Liang, the cultivator he had fought on the other day, who was at the Ling Qi layer, had an eagle spirit. Even though his eagle spirit was extremely violent and powerful, it was still not a fully awakened spirit. Amongst the disciples who had reached the Ling Qi layer, he was still pitifully weak compared to others.Even though everybody had the opportunity to see their spirit awaken, not everyone was able to make it awaken. Some would have great difficulty attempting to awaken their spirit. Lin Feng was aware of that.\u201cI don\u2019t know how much time I have left, but I should have a breakthrough before the annual meeting.\u201d Lin Feng didn\u2019t continue his cultivation instead he stood up and left the cave. He saw Liu Fei in the hot spring and she looked as angered by his presence there as she did when they first met.Liu Fei was staring at Lin Feng. She had the feeling that he had changed since their battle over the hot spring, but she was incapable of spotting exactly how he had changed.\u201cHow many days was I cultivating?\u201d Lin Feng asked without taking notice of Liu Fei\u2019s facial expression.\u201cTwenty days.\u201d Replied Liu Fei coldly.\u201cThat long?\u201d Lin Feng frowned. He would have never thought that he had been meditating for such a long time.\u201cExactly what breakthrough did you have in those twenty days?\u201d shouted Liu Fei who couldn\u2019t bear not knowing any longer.\u201cI just broke through to the ninth Qi layer.\u201d Replied Lin Feng. Immediately after, he vanished in a flash.Lin Feng suddenly rushed out from the mountains and begun heading to the annual meeting in a hurry. There wasn\u2019t much time until the annual meeting. It was about time to go back to Yangzhou city.Liu Fei was stupefied. She could not describe the feeling she was having at this exact moment, but she felt powerless.When Lin Feng was still at the eighth Qi layer, he could easily defeat her. Before she had thought that she was a talented genius. Then Lin Feng had entered her life and shattered her self confidence completely. He did not want her beauty and had far surpassed her talent. What was left for her to have confidence in?\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 - The Whistle Wind RestaurantPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis is a regular release. I missed the regular release Friday as I had to work late.Today is going to be a very busy slave day. I have just finished translating upto chapter 32, I will now be editing them and posting for your reading pleasure.Also since I keep getting messages about Aho Updates. I have applied to them about 3 weeks ago, they have not accepted me yet. Please go and annoy them about accepting me, rather than commenting here.This was one of the toughest chapter for me to translate so far. I really had a tough time! I hope you enjoy xoxoThe end of the year was approaching and Yangzhou City was bustling with activity. Numerous disciples would return home from their various sects and visit their family members.At the end of the year, all the cities and villages of the country had a grand annual meeting. In The world of cultivators these annual meetings were about showcasing talent and gaining recognition within their family.In Yangzhou city, larger Clan\u2019s would all have an internal annual meeting with only members of their clan. During the annual meeting, the older generations within the clan would check the progress of disciples of the younger generations. Once in a while, in the entire city of Yangzhou, some powerful clans would also organize meetings between themselves and other clans, during which they would check which clan had the greatest future potential and the strongest fighting force.At the Whistle Wind Restaurant, There was a group of young disciples, they were all people from the great Clan\u2019s of Yagzhou City. Many outstanding disciples had gathered there to drink wine and discuss about the upcoming annual meetings.\u201cI heard that Lin Qian\u2019s spirit was close to awakening after she had broken through to the Ling Qi layer and because of this she was selected as a Hao Yue Sect elite disciple. Lin Yu, do you think all of this is really true?\u201d asked a young disciple who was holding a feather fan. Everybody was looking at Lin Yu with questioning gazes.\u201cAll of this is obviously true. When she reached the Ling Qi layer, Lin Qian saw her strength increase drastically. For our ceremony, I think that the Lin Clan will be able to showcase extraordinary talents.\u201dLin Yu had a smile on his face. His father was Lin Feng\u2019s uncle and also aiming for the seat as head of the clan, so Lin Yu\u2019s status within the family was obviously adequate enough to declare his opinions on behalf of the Lin Clan.\u201cHahaha. She just broke through to the Ling Qi layer, that\u2019s not an achievement. In my family, Gu Yan already broke through that layer over six months ago. The Lin Clans members obviously do not engage in enough battles, they clearly prefer to cultivate within the safety of their sects.\u201d said the young man wearing a yellow jacket who was sitting in front of Lin Yu. In Yangzhou City, the Gu Clan and the Lin Clan were always hostile with each other. How could he acknowledge anyone within the Lin Clan?\u201cThe time at which one broke through to the Ling Qi layer is insignificant. In my family, Wen Jiang has already reached the second Ling Qi layer. Except for the daughter of the city master, Na La Feng, who can compete with such strength?\u201dThe Wen Clan also didn\u2019t give the impression that this generation of disciples would be weak.The young man holding the feather fan didn\u2019t forget to offer his opinion, his clan had very strong ties within the city government, he couldn\u2019t help but have a teasing smile on his face: \u201cWen Jiang already broke through to the second Ling Qi layer. What a gifted cultivator, what an amazing talent.\u201d\u201cYou invited me here to listen to these stupid and pointless discussions?\u201d said a voice in the background, it was cold and detached which caused everyone to stop talking. It was a young girl who was extremely pretty, but she gave off an icy aura.\u201cOf course not. I invited everyone to come to tell you some news. This year, on the second day of the annual meeting, apart from my clan and members from The Three Great Clan\u2019s of Yangzhou, other outstanding people can also join. Qiu Lan, you should be able to understand what this means?\u201dNa Lan Hai smiled warmly. Everybody had understood. In the past, the city of Yangzhou also had an annual meeting but it was limited to the offspring from the four strongest Clans. They wouldn\u2019t have thought that this time, they would allow other people to join. It seemed like they wanted to solicit the participation of other young people within the city who might be full of potential. They could use this to recruit young talents early.It is said that Qiu Lan is an orphan but her reputation in Yangzhou City was already well established. It was due to her incredibly beautiful appearance as well as to her cold temperament and of course, her natural talent.Qiu Lan nodded her head. She also felt like finding out what kind of abilities the offspring from the four strongest Clan\u2019s were capable of.\u201cHehe, now the upcoming ceremony is certainly going to be wonderful. I heard that the piece of trash of the Lin Clan has progressed in his training and that he even injured Lin Yun as well. I think that the piece of trash will be coming to join the annual meeting as well.\u201d said the young man from the Gu family, with a bright smile on his face. He could feel the excitement welling up inside him.\u201cGu Song, what do you mean? My Lin Clan has a lot of outstanding disciples coming to join our meeting, why would we need a piece of trash to join?\u201d replied Lin Yu who obviously understood to whom they were referring. If he wanted Lin Feng to join the annual meeting then it was obviously to make fun of the Lin Clan, he wanted to ridicule the younger generations of his Clan.\u201cHehe, you\u2019re calling a member of your own family a piece of trash\u2026 that doesn\u2019t seem appropriate.\u201d replied Gu Song with a smile.\u201cA piece of trash is a piece of trash. Why wouldn\u2019t it be appropriate? Besides, I, who is also a member of the main family by blood, sooner or later I will definitely\u2026\u201d Lin Yu didn\u2019t have time to finish his sentence as something had stopped him. He simply groaned and didn\u2019t continue to talk.Right at that moment, the piece of trash they were talking about was riding Qian Li Xue and was about to enter Yangzhou City.After having been traveling for ten days, one could barely see travel fatigue on Lin Feng\u2019s face. Sitting on Qian Li Xue was exhausting but Lin Feng\u2019s facial expression was particularly radiant and didn\u2019t reveal the least bit of sluggishness.Compared to the last time that Lin Feng was in Yangzhou City, his appearance was much sturdier and he looked many times stronger than before. His facial expression was hardened and he looked more like that of a man who knew what he wanted from life.With his sword sheathed neatly on his back, his silver shining belt around his waist and riding triumphantly atop Qian Li Xue, Lin Feng drew the attention of many people. In view of his attire as well as his gentle yet vigorous appearance, he was probably a disciple belonging to one of the powerful Clan\u2019s within the city, who practiced cultivation within a large sect but had come back to participate in the annual meeting.\u201cKeep going.\u201d said Lin Feng. Qian Li Xue had slowed down and stopped galloping when it reached Yangzhou City.\u201cEEEyah\u201dLin Feng passed by a restaurant and a voice came from the top of the building. Even though the sound of the voice had been slight, Lin Feng\u2019s sense of hearing was extremely sharp. Lin Feng raised his head and just saw someone looking at him.\u201cHehe, who is it down there\u2026? Could that be the young master of the Lin Clan? It\u2019s really a coincidence for you to appear at such a time.\u201dThe young man was looking down at Lin Feng mockingly. A short instant later, many faces appeared at the window of the top floor. Amongst them, there was a gloomy face which seemed familiar.\u201cLin Yu.\u201d Thought Lin Feng. Lin Yu was his cousin and held a high status within the Lin Clan, but he had only reached the eighth Qi layer. He wasn\u2019t talented compared to others within the clan, so he used the fact that his bloodline was tied to the main family to elevate his status amongst others.\u201cHmph\u2026\u201d Lin Yu had no respect for Lin Feng at all. He frowned in anger. He hadn\u2019t expected to run into Lin Feng there. The others would use Lin Feng to ridicule his Lin Family even further.\u201cLin Feng, we are a few disciples gathering here before the annual meeting. Since we have crossed paths, please come upstairs and sit with us.\u201d As expected, Gu Song immediately invited Lin Feng to join them, obviously not with the best of intentions.\u201cLin Feng, you travelled over such a long distance, go home first and have a rest.\u201d said Lin Yu who was clearly not willing to see Lin Feng come and join them.Lin Feng was smiling sarcastically in his heart. His status was still young master within the Lin Clan. Lin Feng saw that Lin Yu had not shown even a small amount of politeness to him. Not only did Lin Yu not show him the least bit of politeness but on the contrary had spoke to him in a disrespectful way. Anything that Lin Feng did, Lin Yu contracted it.\u201cWhatever I do, I see it on your face that you\u2019re not satisfied.\u201d Lin Feng thought. He then looked at Gu Song and said: \u201d Alright, I will come upstairs.\u201d\u201cWait, wait.\u201d Lin Yu\u2019s voice became colder and he then added: \u201c Lin Feng, you shouldn\u2019t come to this place. Honestly, you should just run along home.\u201d\u201cHow dare you.\u201d shouted Lin Feng looking straight into Lin Yu\u2019s eyes and then added in an ice cold tone: \u201cWhat status do you think that you hold within the clan, which gives you the nerve to dare talk to me like this?\u201dLin Feng wasn\u2019t the coward and the weakling he was before. His father held an extremely high status within the clan, he was the head of the Lin Clan. Lin Yu had therefore no right to put himself higher in the hierarchy of the family than Lin Feng. If Lin Feng wasn\u2019t a strong cultivator, other people would still think they could bully him when his father was not present.When Lin Yu heard Lin Feng talk to him like that, he boiled with anger. He obviously hadn\u2019t expected that Lin Feng would have changed so much. This response was completely unreasonable for such a weakling. Lin Yu\u2019s face had turned red with anger. He had no idea how to reply to Lin Feng. Lin Feng\u2019s status within the clan was higher than his own, he was the young head of family. Even though Lin Yu was his cousin, he still didn\u2019t have the right to act arrogantly towards Lin Feng, even if Lin Feng had openly embarrassed him.\u201cHehe, that\u2019s the attitude that Lin Feng has as the young family head of the Lin Clan.\u201d said Gu Song hoping to see them quarrel, making Lin Yu even more furious.At that moment, Lin Feng had already come down from his horse and handed the reins to the owner of the restaurant. Immediately after that, he went up to the third floor and headed to the private room the other disciples were in.Eight people were sitting at the table, all of them were young disciples from powerful Clan\u2019s.When they saw Lin Feng enter, nobody said a word. Everyone had their respective seat and they sat their quietly sipping on their wine. They all ignored Lin Feng. Even Gu Song, who had invited Lin Feng to come up a moment ago, remained silent and was grinning.\u201cHmph, the piece of trash is making a fool of himself. Even as the young master of the Gu clan. What status do you even have to make fun of my clan?\u201d said Lin Yu who didn\u2019t even look at Lin Feng as if he was talking to himself.\u201cThe son of the family head, this is my status. You may have forgotten, Lin Yu, but that piece of trash is the son of the head of the Lin Clan.\u201d reminded Gu Song. He enjoyed assisting to that kind of situation the most, seeing the Lin Clan lose face.Lin Feng smiled. Everybody was looking at Gu Song. Lin Feng made a few steps forwards to Gu Song.\u201cMay I sit?\u201d\u201cWhat makes you think that you can sit here?\u201d said Wen Shan impolitely. In Yangzhou City, there were four powerful Clan\u2019s. The family which belonged to the master of the city was the strongest one. There was ongoing hostility between the other three great clans, there was an especially large amount of tension between the Gu Clan and the Lin Clan. The Gu Clan wouldn\u2019t miss an opportunity to attack the Lin Clan. The Wen clan obviously also wouldn\u2019t miss an opportunity to do so.\u201cOh, what exactly do you mean?\u201d Lin Feng didn\u2019t look at Wen Shan, and only asked Gu Song.\u201cYou don\u2019t understand? You Piece of trash, nothing gives you the right to sit with us.\u201d said Gu Song to Lin Feng in a disdainful way. Lin Feng really had no idea how low his status was compared to these disciples.\u201cAh I understand, you\u2019re making fun of me right?\u201d Lin Feng said while not losing his temper. He was as calm as before.\u201cWhatever, get lost.\u201d Gu Song shouted angrily. He had expected Lin Feng would cower and retreat allowing him to humiliate the Lin Clan.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 - TeasingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySpecial Thanks to Gary R for this sponsored chapter. I hope you all enjoy, more to come later today!!Tonight will be a good night for PMG fans ???? xoxLin Feng had a cold smile on his face. He reached towards the table, grabbed a cup of wine, inclined the cup and slowly poured it over Gu Song\u2019s head.Everybody stopped talking looked stupefied. They obviously would have never thought that Lin Feng would dare to retaliate to such humiliation and they especially never thought he would actually pour wine over Gu Song\u2019s head.The entire crowd was shocked and continued watching the scene with interest, especially Lin Yu who had a resplendent smile on his face. Not only was he able to see Gu Song lose face but he was also going to be able to see that piece of trash get crushed by Gu Song. That wonderful scene was taking place right before his eyes, how could he not be happy?Gu Song clearly hadn\u2019t expected such a thing from Lin Feng either. He had his eyes closed because some alcohol had gone into his eye which caused a small stinging pain. He then wiped the wine from his face using his bare hand.He then opened his eyes which began to narrow with anger. His eyes had become so narrow that he looked like a deadly viper.\u201cThat piece of trash has run out of luck today. He will not die but I will make him wish he was dead.\u201d Everybody saw Gu Song\u2019s ice cold expression. It seemed like there would be more hostility between the Lin Clan and the Gu Clan in the future.\u201cYou dared to pour wine over my head?!\u201d said Gu Song whose eyes were slightly red. The tone of his voice was low, he had said it calmly, but that had made it even more frightening. Gu Song was furious.\u201cDid you not see it was me because your eyes were closed? Quick, someone fetch me another cup of wine.\u201d said Lin Feng while gesturing for more wine.\u201cI honestly don\u2019t understand. Where does a piece of trash like you find the courage to do such a thing? Have you even considered the consequences of what you did? Or have you maybe stupidly thought that Lin Yu would stand up to protect you?\u201d said Gu Song in a tone which was trying to ridicule both Lin Feng and Lin Yu.Lin Feng didn\u2019t reply right away. Instead, he grabbed a bottle of wine which was still on the table, opened it and then lifted it above Gu Song\u2019s head. Gu Song stood there shocked as the wine continued to pour over him, not only soaking his face but soaking his whole body with wine.\u201cI also don\u2019t understand why you use the term \u201cpiece of trash\u201d that much. Are you trying to scare me? Or is it to cover up that terrible feeling which you have deep inside, because you are so insignificant? Are you hesitating now? Does the bastard of the Gu Clan have no courage? It makes us wonder whether that is inherited from his common blood or from that of the Gu Clan.\u201dGu Song was the son of the head of the Gu Clan and one of the maids. He was undoubtedly a young master but of a lesser rank in the hierarchy of the Clan. That was Gu Song\u2019s deepest regret, the simple mention of this had given him the sensation of a knot in his heart. He also utterly detested other people mentioning it to his face. Lin Feng\u2019s words had clearly touched on a very sensitive subject.\u201cYou want to die\u2026\u201d As expected, Gu Song\u2019s expression changed and he looked even more evil. He was boiling over with fury and his killing intent could not be hidden.Gu Song, without hesitation thrust out his fist in an attempt to strike Lin Feng, his fist whistled through the air at an incredible speed.Everyone who was sitting at the table was trembling with fear at the speed and power of such a punch. Gu Song was truly enraged. That punch was aimed at smashing Lin Feng\u2019s head with enough power to rip it from his neck. He had attacked with the intention to behead Lin Feng with his bare hands.Lin Yu, unlike the others, could not help but smile even more, the smile on his face was remarkably large. He had really hoped from the bottom of his heart, that Lin Feng would die a painful death from Gu Song\u2019s strike.But things didn\u2019t happen the way that he had wished. Gu Song\u2019s punch stopped halfway between him and Lin Feng. Of course, it wasn\u2019t Gu Song showing mercy. It was because the palm of a hand had stopped his punch completely. This hand had stopped the punch completely and in one motion closed, grabbing hold of Gu Song\u2019s fist. It seemed the palm of that hand had easily stopped Gu Song\u2019s punch, there were no signs of damage and it actually looked rather effortless. Gu Song\u2019s face turned red and he was unable to move his fist away from the palm. It was Lin Feng who had reached out and stopped the punch as naturally as breathing. There were no signs of struggle on his face and he was still very relaxed and calm.\u201cHuh?\u201d everybody was in a state of shock. How was such a thing even possible? How could Lin Feng block such a powerful attack so easily? Besides, Lin Feng\u2019s facial expression hadn\u2019t changed at all while Gu Song was clearly struggling to remove his fist from the grasp of Lin Feng.\u201cActually, I don\u2019t understand either. You are just another worthless bastard from the Gu Clan and you think you have the right to tease me. You call me a piece of trash\u2026 what status do you hold?\u201d\u201cCRUNCH\u201dGu Song gave a horrible shriek. A sharp pain invaded his fist. The pain made his face look hideously distorted. Lin Feng had crushed the fist with his hand strength alone.\u201cGet lost. I have decided to let you leave with your life\u201d said Lin Feng while waving his hand which was holding Gu Song\u2019s Fist. Right after, Gu Song was thrown out of the window on the top floor. Everybody heard the sound of Gu Song\u2019s body landing heavily onto the ground outside followed by painful moans.Everybody at the table was completely stunned. Gu Song was at the eighth Qi layer and he had, in the blink of an eye, been injured and then thrown out of the window by that piece of trash. What had just happened?\u201cPheww\u2026\u201d everyone let out a deep sigh. Is this really the piece of trash of the Lin Clan?Lin Feng had a quick glance at everyone. Immediately after, he looked at Lin Yu. Seeing that Lin Feng was calmly looking at him, Lin Yu could not help but be completely terrified. That\u2019s right, Lin Yu had just called Lin Feng a piece of trash and yet standing before him was a terrifying monster which was hard for him to recognize as Lin Feng.It seemed like Lin Feng had gone through a complete transformation. He had turned into a ferocious beast which was hiding in human form. Lin Feng used to be completely different. Lin Feng was known for being timid and weak. But at that moment, Lin Feng looked like a powerful an unmoving beast. His temperament was wild and powerful. Was this really the piece of trash he knew?\u201cWhat was the name which you just called me?\u201d Lin Feng asked Lin Yu.Lin Yu\u2019s lips slightly moved but there was no sound which could escape his throat. He actually didn\u2019t know what to answer. He was so terrified of the person stood in front of him.\u201cA piece of trash?\u201d Lin Feng said smiling coldly. Right after, Lin Yu sensed a cold wind and a sharp sound echoed through the air. Suddenly his face felt like it was burning from the pressure given by the wind. It was extremely painful.Lin Feng had given him a slap across the face.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lin Yu covered his face. His facial muscles were all on fire. Lin Feng had surprisingly given him a slap in the face while in the presence of everyone else\u2026 but when Lin Yu saw that Lin Feng was still staring at him as calmly as before, he swallowed down the things he wanted to say and did not make another sound.\u201cNext time you want to say something, watch your words. Remember what status you hold and what status I hold.\u201d Lin Feng said in a cold tone. After that, he stopped paying attention to Lin Yu and ignored him. He passed behind Lin Yu and went over to Wen Shan.\u201cWhat do you intend to do?\u201d asked Wen Shan while remaining his vigilance and looking worryingly at Lin Feng. That guy was able to throw Gu Song out of the window, He was not only strong but also daring.\u201cAre you scared?\u201d asked Lin Feng in a teasing way.\u201cI\u2026\u201dWen Shan wanted to open his mouth but stopped before saying anything. Suddenly, an ice cold killing intent emerged from Lin Feng\u2019s body which made Wen Shan\u2019s scalp go numb. He swallowed his fear and looked down at the ground. Just like Lin Yu a moment ago, his face turned red and was unable to find the courage to retaliate.\u201c\u2026am the Piece of trash.\u201dThe ice cold killing intent which had emerged out of Lin Feng\u2019s body had vanished. Lin Feng then turned around and headed back outside. Nobody even dared give him a glance.\u201cArghh\u2026\u201d Wen Shan groaned from his embarrassment. He was holding his glass of wine so firmly that it shattered in his hand. Even though Lin Feng hadn\u2019t touched him, the way Lin Feng had forced him to cower, had made him feel incredibly ashamed and humiliated at himself. He had thought Lin Feng had no right to sit with them but during the confrontation with Lin Feng, he hadn\u2019t dared move a single finger to the extent that Lin Feng hadn\u2019t even needed to touch him once. His cup of wine along with his self respect were both now shattered into pieces .At that moment, Lin Yu\u2019s state of mind wasn\u2019t any better than that of Wen Shan. He even could still feel Lin Feng\u2019s hand mark on his face. Why did he feel so low? As Lin Feng was standing in front of him, he had made him lose the courage to even resist a slap to the face.Everyone else sitting at the table remained silent. They all wanted to humiliate that piece of trash of the Lin Clan. They hadn\u2019t expected he would be able to humiliate them like that. These young cultivators claimed to be the best juniors in Yangzhou City\u2026 One had been injured and thrown out of the window by Lin Feng, the other had been slapped in the face and the other one had been so scared that he had called himself trash. Did Lin Feng really not have the right to sit with them?Qiu Lan\u2019s eyes were shining. She was the strongest cultivator of the group. She had already reached the Ling Qi layer. As Lin Feng was still standing there, she could clearly feel that Lin Feng had a certain natural aura which made people feel ashamed of their inferiority.As far as Lin Feng was concerned, he hadn\u2019t thought at all that his appearance in the restaurant on that day would have made all these people think so much about him. He just didn\u2019t want to get humiliated, insulted and called a piece of trash any longer. That group of disciples from the powerful clans were used to setting themselves above the masses. Lin Feng couldn\u2019t bear looking at their ugly and repulsive faces so he had taught them a lesson in humility.Qian Li Xue slowly trotted past the Whistle Wind Restaurant, Gu Song was watching Lin Feng\u2019s silhouette leaving unhurriedly in the distance. His face clearly revealed that he planned to get his revenge on the trash of the Lin Clan by any means necessary.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I wonder what Cultivation level he has reached now?\u201d\u201cHehe. He came back but there\u2019s only possibility: he will lose face for his father and himself at the annual meeting. The sons and daughters of the upper members within the clan are all incredibly powerful now. Even though Lin Feng has reached the seventh Qi layer, he is still very weak.\u201d\u201cYes, indeed. That piece of trash could defeat Lin Yun but who was Lin Yun compared to the talented practitioners within the Lin Clan. If I were him, I would hide away in his Sect and never come out.\u201dMany of the clan members were making these remarks quietly in private as they did not want to offend the Head of the Clan. The great majority of clan members were secretly sneering at Lin Feng. Even if Lin Feng had the status of young head of clan, he was still a piece of trash.At that moment, Lin Feng had already arrived within the head residential quarters, it was not very big, but it was sturdy and clean. This is where only his father and He were permitted to live.\u201cFather.\u201d said Lin Feng when he arrived in Lin Hai\u2019s room. He saw that his father sitting down and seemed to be painting.\u201cLittle Feng, you came back.\u201d Lin Hai said while raising his head. He put the picture he was painting to the side and warmly smiled at Lin Feng.\u201cYes, the annual meeting will take place in seven days. I came back to join the meeting with the rest of the disciples sent to other sects.\u201d Lin Feng briefly looked at the painting his father had put to the side. In his memories from the previous Lin Feng he knew that Lin Hai liked the sense of tranquility. It seemed related to his passion of painting. He did not like to be disturbed when he was painting. However, Lin Feng had never seen any of Lin Hai\u2019s paintings.\u201cLittle Feng, you shouldn\u2019t join the annual meeting. Let them go and agitate each other alone.\u201d Lin Hai said while shaking his head.\u201cFather, why is that?\u201d\u201cHehe, this year\u2019s annual meeting, they all can\u2019t wait to see us lose face, I don\u2019t care about them but you better be careful, little Feng.\u201d said Lin Hai while heaving a heavy sigh. The Lin Clan had been changing in the recent days and it was no longer calm and peacful. His two brothers, a few cousins and even a few elders had already started establishing a plan in order to make him abdicate his spot as head of the clan.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, father. I will be fine.\u201d said Lin Feng while shaking his head. He had already broken through to the ninth Qi layer, even if some strong people wanted to confront him during the annual meeting to make him lose face, Lin Feng would be able to return the favor. He has no one to fear below the Ling Qi Layer.\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Hai was surprised by his son\u2019s reaction and was staring deep into Lin Feng\u2019s eyes. He couldn\u2019t help but smile when he noticed how self confident Lin Feng was.\u201cHaha, if my son wants to go, then he will go. We will go to the annual meeting and they will see that making me abdicate is no easy task.\u201d\u201cBut, Little Feng, you really have to be careful during the annual meeting. I heard that Lin Qian has already reached the Ling Qi layer. She will not appreciate that her father lost face during the meeting of elders\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a rumor. She has already broken through to the Ling Qi layer. But I do not plan to let her easily try and harm me.\u201d said Lin Feng whose eyes were emanating a cold killing intent. Lin Qian had gone to the Yun Hai Sect because she wanted to kill him. Before leaving the Yun Hai Sect, she had also threatened him that if they meet again at the annual meeting then she would kill him. He was going to see how Lin Qian was planning to act against him during the event.\u201cFather, I am going to practice first. Come and collect me on the day of the annual meeting.\u201d said Lin Feng while leaving. Even though Lin Feng wasn\u2019t weak, Lin Qian had an ice and fire universal spirit which wasn\u2019t easy to deal with. It was better for him to gain as much strength as possible in the short time he had. Even a small amount might save his life.At that moment, outside of the residential quarters of the Lin Clan, a colt was galloping, there was a hurricane full of flames around its body. Lin Qian was riding on the back of a Fire Colt. She was wearing a fiery red set of robes which matched her colt and made her look like she was an extremely wealthy noble. Her magnificent posture at that moment would have made anyone unable to utter a single bad word against her. She was like a queen who was looking down at the lowly masses with disdain.\u201cYour Grace.\u201d the entrance guard said to her respectfully. They all respected her much more than they respected Lin Feng. They didn\u2019t even dare look at Lin Qian. Her temperament made them feel unworthy. They knew that she would eventually hold a great position within the clan.Lin Qian did not glance sideways and immediately entered into the residential area of the Lin Clan. She looked extremely arrogant as if she truly believed she was royalty. She was followed closely by two people wearing the robes of the Hao Yue Sect and they quickly followed her into Lin Clan quarters.\u201cHer Grace really doesn\u2019t look the same as before. She is much more beautiful than I remember and she also looks even more elegant. Her Grace, Lin Qian has no equal within the Lin Clan.\u201d said one of the entrance guards as he watched her walk into the Lin Clan Quarters.\u201cOf course, she has broken through to the Ling Qi layer. She extremely strong and beautiful\u2026 and Her Grace, Lin Qian is only sixteen years old. She has a bright future opening up to her. She is far better than that piece of trash who calls himself the young master. Her friends also all look extremely strong. They must be the elite of the Yue Hao Sect.\u201d said the other guard. In their eyes, Lin Feng and Lin Qian had absolutely nothing in common, they were incomparable. One was in the Hao Yue Sect and had a status that was on the same level as royalty, the other had a lower status than the dirt beneath their shoes. There were no doubts in their mind, Lin Feng had no choice but to look up at her like a lowly peasant for all of his life.Lin Qian and two Hao Yue Sect\u2019s disciples arrived to the residential quarters in the blink of an eye, the speed at which they had moved left storm of wind behind them. People were much more agitated than when Lin Feng had arrived. All the clan members began to gather around their future leader like flies. Some clan members and even some elders were already heading towards the garden of the house where Lin Ba Dao lived to give him their respects. A bright future was awaiting Lin Qian, full of opportunities, which wasn\u2019t the case of all the members of the Lin Clan.That\u2019s why many people in the Lin Clan were willing to help Lin Ba Dao to climb in the hierarchy of the clan. That way, Lin Qian would obtain more power. She would be the glory of the clan. All these people helping Lin Ba Dao would obviously also gain favor from his daughter in the future. With her future prospects, they could only humble themselves in front of Lin Ba Dao.In comparison with the residential quarter where Lin Qian lived, Lin Feng\u2019s area of residence looked desolate and abandoned. Nonetheless, Lin Qian hadn\u2019t forgotten the promise she had made Lin Feng. She glanced in the direction where Lin Feng lived with killing intent in her eyes, her gaze was as sharp as a sword.\u201cThis time, I will make sure to take good care of you.\u201d Lin Qian said while glaring at Lin Feng with a ruthless smile.Two days later, Lin Ba Dao\u2019s eldest son, Lin Hong, also returned to the clan. Lin Hong was studying in a mountain village called Xue Ying. Xue Ying Mountain Village was not a Sect but their strength was not the least bit inferior to that of a large Sect. It had an extremely good reputation in the Xue Yue Country. Besides, the Xue Ying Mountain Village only accepted cultivators who possessed snow and ice spirits.Lin Hong had also greatly improved his cultivation since the last time by leaps and bounds. He had broken through to the ninth Qi layer. One more little step would enable him to break through to the Ling Qi layer. The entire Lin Clan was thrilled to have such great talents within the younger generations. It seemed like the entire future of the clan was under the complete domination of Lin Ba Dao.Apart from Lin Hong, a myriad of other members of the younger generations were coming back, belonging to different branches within the clan. The annual meeting was drawing closer and closer.Lin Ba Dao\u2019s house had a constant stream of visitor and his courtyard was as visited as a marketplace, it seemed like he had already become the head of the Lin Clan. To the extent that there was absolutely nobody around the house of the real head of the clan, Lin Hai. It was extremely desolate around his residence. No one had bothered to come and pay him resepect like they had done for Lin Ba Dao.Finally, the annual meeting was about to start. Everybody belonging to the Lin Clan was extremely excited. They were wondering what level the juniors of the clan had reached during their practice away from the clan. The disciples would be judged into groups of weak, average and strong. Many were wondering where their sons and daughters would fit within the clan rankings, all secretly hoping that their descendants would be within the strongest rankings, securing them a great future within the clan. They were also wondering if some new geniuses were going to reveal their talents and distinguish themselves within the younger generations. During the event, all the results are announced publicly.The annual meeting was one of the most celebrated and joyous days within any clan as it showed the future prospects of the clan. A great amount of talent in the younger generation would provide the clan more prestige and glory in the future.Three months ago, some people had wanted Lin Hai to abdicate but Lin Hai was so strong that it was frightening and intimidating. But during the annual meeting, they would have more courage than at any other moment of the year. Lin Qian would prove that the future of the clan is with Lin Ba Dao. Some Lin Clan members also had friends from other clans who had come to witness the events.Lin Feng came out of his room while stretching his arms. He took a deep breath and took the time to appreciate the sun in the sky.Lin Feng hadn\u2019t thought that this day was any different from the previous days before it. The status of the head of the clan. Lin Feng didn\u2019t care, what he was looking for was the highest peak on the path of cultivation. Only the strongest could demand the attention of others. The Head of the clan was just a fabricated name. If someone was strong and powerful enough, then nobody could oppose him. Who would dare to disobey?Lin Feng still knew that his father also didn\u2019t care about such things either. Lin Hai wasn\u2019t too attracted by power and influence. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be that calm and serene after such events. If the Lin Clan didn\u2019t organize major events, he would almost never show his face and appear in public. Only by him appearing in public would the others have the ability to criticize him and try to force him to abdicate.\u201cLittle Feng, you are already finished practicing.\u201d said Lin Hai approaching towards Lin Feng. He had come intending to wake him up from his meditation.\u201cYes\u201d said Lin Feng while nodding.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThey left together towards the annual meeting.The number of people within the annual meeting of the Lin Clan was huge. Everybody had already arrived much earlier and they were all excitedly waiting for the upcoming events. When Lin Feng and Lin Hai arrived at the annual meeting, many people stared at them. Every person had a different expression, however the majorities were expressions of mocking or disdain.\u201cIt\u2019s Lin Feng.\u201dMany people were looking at Lin Feng with cold expressions. Some of the faces that could be distinguished from the others were that of Lin Heng whose cultivation had been crippled by Lin Feng, as well as Lin Yun, Lin Qian, Lin Yu and of course, there was also Lin Feng\u2019s third uncle Lin Hao Ran. Lin Hao Ran\u2019s two sons were Lin Yun who had been humiliated by Lin Feng and Lin Heng whose Cultivation had been crippled by Lin Feng. All in all, it was easy to say who hated Lin Feng the most in the Lin Clan.Lin Hao Ran even hid Lin Heng away and made him stay out of sight so he would not lose face. He didn\u2019t want anyone to know what had happened between Lin Heng and Lin Feng. Also, he didn\u2019t want to see Lin Feng\u2019s father proud that the plan to cripple Lin Feng has backfired and destroyed Lin Hao Ran\u2019s standing within the clan.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 - Let The Fun Begin!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySpecial thanks to Jasim A, he enjoys reading this during his classes. So he was nice enough to sponsor this chapter and the next completely! Thank you for the support xoAnother chapter to be released after this. Then I will finally get a break aka hibernation.I hope you all enjoy xoxoxLin Hai and Lin Feng were moving towards the host who was standing on the large stage. On a platform to the side with a raised seating area sat Lin Ba Dao, Lin Zhen, Lin Hao Ran and Lin Qian. They were sitting upright with their heads held high, setting themselves high above the others as if they were the masters of the Lin family.When the clan elder Lin Zhen saw that Lin Hai and Lin Feng were approaching, he stood up and said in a clear loud voice: \u201cyou have finally arrived, we are thus ready to start the annual meeting.\u201dWhen Lin Hai heard Lin Zhen, he stopped walking and stared at him. Everybody then stared at Lin Hai stupefied wondering what was wrong with him.\u201cLin Hai, what\u2019s wrong, what are you doing?\u201d asked Lin Zhen seeing that Lin Hai had stopped walking.\u201cHmmm, Lin Ba Dao, I would like to ask you, who\u2019s the current head of the Lin Clan?\u201d asked Lin Hai in an icy tone.Lin Ba Dao was stunned but he pretended to be calm as he replied: \u201cYou, Lin Hai, of course.\u201d\u201cThen, I have another question for you, isn\u2019t the annual meeting of the Lin Clan of paramount importance?\u201dcontinued Lin Hai looking straight into Lin Zhen\u2019s eyes.\u201cOf course, it is. Every year, the annual meeting of our clan is the most important event of the year.\u201d\u201cVery good, then I have another question, who is charge of managing that major event?\u201dLin Zhen\u2019s face started to look desperate when hearing all of Lin Hai\u2019s questions. He obviously knew what in Hai meant with all those questions.\u201cThe Clan Head is in charge.\u201d\u201cSince I have a clear understanding now that everything is handled by the Clan Head, Lin Zhen, I would like to ask you, what on earth do you think you are doing up there?\u2026 I am still the head of our Lin Clan, correct?\u201d Lin Hai\u2019s tone was extremely harsh.Lin Zhen and Lin Ba Dao had been acting hand in hand with each other to try and force Lin Hai to abdicate. It was not a secret and had been going on for such a long time that almost everybody knew about it. Lin Zhen was becoming more and more impertinent. Today he even announced the beginning of the event without waiting for Lin Hai to be seated.\u201cHehe, uncle, you came a bit too late. The esteemed elder is just doing what he\u2019s supposed to do, is it wrong for him to carry out his duties? Uncle shows no understanding.\u201d Lin Qian said in a neutral tone.\u201cSHUT UP!\u201d shouted Lin Hai who had released his temper. \u201cYou dare to interrupt the head of the family while he\u2019s talking? Lin Ba Dao, take good care of your daughter\u2026 what kind of terrible education has she received until now?\u201dLin Qian had a ugly face which was twisted in anger. She insulted Lin Hai deep in her heart. That guy hasn\u2019t been the clan head for a long time and he is already starting to lose his temper?\u201cShe\u2019s at least much stronger than your son, that piece of trash is the one who should be educated.\u201d Lin Ba Dao said while staring Lin Feng in the eyes and smiling coldly. Everyone in the Lin clan had complimented Lin Qian for her achievements, how could Lin Hai dare to insult her?\u201cWatch your words. A very small clan head of the Lin Family, in the eyes of my Sect, is a tiny individual with no power.\u201d said a girl of the Hao Yue Sect who was standing next to Lin Qian while smiling coldly. That girl was wearing magnificent robes. She had a very unkind look on her face, much like Lin Qian. She was an elite disciple of the Hao Yue Sect. She had a low opinion of the Lin Clan and did not believe it was worth giving them face.\u201cYou\u2019re saying that your Yue Hao Sect is really extraordinary, then why are you sitting equally with Lin clan members? It seems that my father, the only head of the Lin Clan, never actually invited you to join us. You seem to be a really shameless person, I see that the Yue Hao Sect is extraordinarily shameless.\u201d said Lin Feng who had remained silent until now. He couldn\u2019t bear it anymore so he decided to open his mouth. Who could compete with him when it came to wits? He had the experience of two lifetimes. In that world, language had a profound meaning.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d the facial expression of the mean girl suddenly changed but she immediately smiled coldly after and said: \u201cThe piece of trash of the Yun Hai Sect also dares to open his big mouth.\u201d\u201cWhether or not I am a piece of trash is not the problem at the moment. I, at least, have honor and a sense of integrity, not like a certain person, coming to someone\u2019s clan and insulting the head of their clan. Are all the Hao Yue Sect\u2019s disciples like this? How extraordinary indeed.\u201dLin Feng was being incredibly sarcastic. Everybody\u2019s face immediately changed.\u201cYou animal, you dare insult and humiliate the Hao Yue Sect.\u201d said a Lin clan elder who had stood up. He was furious.\u201cThis is truly hilarious, she is in the middle of the Lin Clan and stands before you all and insults the head of the Lin Clan and there\u2019s immediately someone standing up to defend her. I would like to ask you, Seventh Elder, are you a member of the Lin Clan or a whipped dog of the Hao Yue Sect?\u201dLin Feng\u2019s words were sharp and incisive like a sword cutting deep into the Elders pride. Lin Feng had been firm when saying these words and questioned the integrity of the elder.\u201cMy son is correct. I also want to ask you a question, Seventh Elder, is your family name also Lin?\u201d asked Lin Hai continuing Lin Feng\u2019s argumentation. Lin Hai was extremely surprised at that moment too. Not only had his son made huge progress on the path of cultivation but his way of speaking had also become extremely eloquent. Lin Feng\u2019s words had become as flowing as blood.\u201cAlright, I made a mistake, you are indeed the head of the clan. The annual meeting is of paramount importance. It cannot be delayed. So please come up and manage it as a head of Lin Clan.\u201d said Lin Zhen who had received Lin Ba Dao\u2019s approbation. They had found a compromise. Actually, they wanted to see how long Lin Hai and Lin Feng could be that aggressive.\u201cHum.\u201d Lin Hai wiped his sleeves then walked over to the platform and then sat amongst them.\u201cHow long are you still going to be so proud? You dare to insult the elite disciples of my sect. Lin Hai, I want you to pay attention to the fate of that piece of trash you call a son.\u201d Lin Qian thought to herself.\u201cLet the annual meeting begin.\u201d Lin Hai looked at the stages which were created for practice battles between clan members. The Lin Clan was composed of over five hundred people. Around eighteen of them were young people of the youngest generation of the clan but there were about seventy young people who belonged to the golden age of talent within the Lin Clan. Unfortunately, there were some clan members who were unpredictable and would try to harm his son. The Lin Clan was not a single entity and there were smaller factions attempting to increase their power. If Lin Hai had abdicated, that would have been a mistake and would have driven the clan into chaos.Lin Hai had bitter feelings. Why did he need to have all these worries about the Lin Clan and its future?\u201cFather, don\u2019t worry. I will not let anyone do me any harm.\u201d Thought Lin Hai who was feeling guilty. He remembered what his father had said to him on his deathbed. Unfortunately, he hadn\u2019t been able to apply it.The annual meeting was actually a big test for all the juniors of the Lin Clan to see how much they had progressed and to see what the future prospects of the Lin Clan looked like.There was also some fighting involved in the annual meeting to test the strength of the junior generation.The Second Elder of the Clan went on the fighting stage and said in a clear and loud voice: \u201cThe first round of the annual meeting will be as such: it\u2019s a free for all, everyone comes on the fighting stage and the last thirty-two members left can continue to the next round.\u201dThe Second Elder of the Lin Clan stepped down from the stage and the junior disciples of the Lin Clan all went on to the fighting stage.Lin Feng nodded while looking at his father, Lin Hai. He also stepped on the stage.\u201cI don\u2019t know if Lin Qian will be focused on me from the very start.\u201d Thought Lin Feng who was standing on the stage with complete concentration on his surroundings.Seventy three young disciples had arrived on the stage. Everyone was extremely vigilant, especially the weaker ones. They were easy targets for the others to quickly reduce the numbers.Lin Qian was still standing there unmoving on the stage. Many other disciples were giving up and leaving the stage. They didn\u2019t dare provoke others who were stronger than themselves. The goal of the first round was to eliminate the weakest ones. The strong ones rarely really attacked at that stage except for if they were looking for trouble. Lin Qian was without a doubt one of the strongest disciples on the stage. Most of the disciples on the stage couldn\u2019t compete with her.As far as Lin Feng was concerned, he quickly noticed that many people were staring at him. Many people had twinkling eyes when looking at Lin Feng as if they were looking at a pile of gold with greed in their eyes. They all considered him an easy target.Some battles had already started on the stage. A young clan member who was wielding a spear was rushing towards Lin Feng. Everyone near him started to surround him. Lin Feng obviously knew they were not worth his time.\u201cGet lost, get down off the stage. If you stay here then we will force you to lose face.\u201d said Lin Wu with an expression revealing how much he despised Lin Feng. He was the son of the Seventh Elder, with whom Lin Feng had argued and humiliated.Lin Wu was at the seventh Qi layer six month ago when they had last met, with his ongoing training, he had probably reached the eighth Qi layer already. His strength was similar to that of Lin Yu.\u201cHe\u2019s mine.\u201d said an ice cold voice, sending shivers down the spines of many clan members. Lin Feng then saw Lin Qian wearing her red robes looking as arrogant as ever.\u201cIt\u2019s all the same to me.\u201d Lin Wu was obviously not going to argue with Lin Qian and opened the way for her.Lin Qian walked over to Lin Feng and said: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, nobody will touch you during the first round. You will successfully move forward to the next rounds. If you were to be knocked out this early, there would be no fun at all.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Feng said stupefied. He wouldn\u2019t have expected Lin Qian to protect him and prevent him from getting knocked out of the competition so early. That was amusing but not losing so early\u2026 what could he have against that? Of course Lin Feng understood, if Lin Qian hadn\u2019t been protecting him, he could have lost during the first round due to the sheer numbers he was facing.However, in the Life or Death Arena of the Yun Hai Sect, Lin Feng had defeated a cultivator of the ninth Qi layer in one hit.\u201cWhat is Lin Qian doing, why is she taking care of that piece of trash and protecting him?\u201d said Lin Zhen who was ready to watch Lin Feng make a fool of himself but instead saw Lin Qian protect him. He couldn\u2019t help but ask Lin Ba Dao about the turn of events.\u201cDon\u2019t you think that seeing such a piece of trash making it to the second round is a really funny joke? Besides, the second round is composed of several small fights, everyone has to fight a few times. In this kind of situation do you think that a piece of trash will be able to return unharmed when the time comes for the numerous fights of the second round? We just have to wait for the second round, which is where the real fun will begin.\u201d\u201cHehe, how could I not think about that? This will be an entertaining event indeed.\u201d Lin Zhen was delighted by the explanation. He could already imagine Lin Feng getting completely crippled in one hit during the second round.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 - The First BlowPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySpecial Thanks to Jasim A, he is supporting all of your addictions.I paid special attention to make sure it landed on a cliffhanger!!! haha it was not me, if you want to blame something then blame your own lack of donations. If there was $20 more I would have translated another chapter ahead of time ????(TL: If you want to blame something then blame your own lack of strength)I have an IV filled with monster energy to stay awake. I have been working a full 10 hours on those 5 chapters, if you include my breaks inbetween ???? ok maybe 8 1/2 if we don\u2019t include breaks. hehehe I hope you enjoyed my release day.Thank you all for supporting me, I will possibly do another slave day tomorrow as well ^^ xoxoHalf an hour later, the first round which consisted of eliminating the weakest clan members had finally come to a conclusion. Only thirty two clan members were still on the stage. The ones who had been eliminated were mostly at the fifth or sixth Qi layer and were not very strong compared to the talented disciples within the clan. There were also some clan members who had reached the seventh Qi layer but who had run out of luck during the fights and been eliminated. Others had been attacked by multiple opponents and were knocked off stage using their numbers.There were also some who had not moved a single finger at all during the first round: Lin Qian as well as her older brother Lin Hong, Lin Wu, Lin Yu and Lin Feng.\u201cHehe, that guy is really lucky. Lin Qian surprisingly helped him move forward to the next round.\u201d\u201cI wonder why Lin Qian helped him get to the second round.\u201dLin Feng was the subject of all sorts of comments. Of course, many of these comments, regarding why he was able to move onto the second round, were inaccurate. He could have easily dealt with all the disciples outside the stage and would only have been eliminated with bad luck.In the contest of the second round there were four groups of eight fighters. All had to wait for their turn to fight. Every single fighter of a group had to fight the seven others of his group. The two best fighters of one group would be able to move onto the third round.First, the groups had to be formed and then they would be announced by the Second Elder. Lin Qian was put in the first group.\u201cLin Feng, Lin Yan, Lin Tao, Lin Yue, Lin Ran, Lin Li, Lin Cai Zhu, Lin Yu, you\u2019re all in the fourth group.\u201dWhen he heard the names of the ones that were in the fourth group, the Third Elder laughed: \u201cAll the weakest ones are in the fourth group. Considering Lin Yu\u2019s strength, there should be absolutely no problem.\u201d\u201cLin Yu should dominate all the others in the fourth group by far.\u201d Said Lin Ba Dao politely.\u201cHaha, you bet. If Lin Yu had to battle with Lin Qian, he would take the initiative to give up.\u201d Said the Third Elder who had agreed with Lin Ba Dao\u2019s words.\u201cDo you know what rank Lin Feng will hold within the fourth group?\u201d whispered the Third Elder while unconsciously looking at Lin Hai.The gigantic battle stage for the second round was divided into four different stages. Dividing the larger stage into four smaller stages was a way for all the participants to engage in battles at the same time and progress onto the next round together.\u201cFirst group: Lin Qian versus Lin Han; second group: Lin Hong versus Lin Lei; third group: Lin Wu versus Lin Xiao; fourth group: Lin Feng versus Lin Yan.\u201dPeople in the crowd had longing in their eyes when they heard who was fighting the first fight within the first group. Everyone was only paying attention to that stage. It seemed like the Second Elder had voluntarily arranged the battle that way.All the first group fighters were quite well known. There was nothing to say about Lin Qian and her brother Lin Hong. Lin Wu was also a famous figure amongst the disciples of the younger generation. Even though Lin Feng was weak, everyone knew who he was in the crowd. That is the reason why Lin Feng was chosen and not Lin Yu.The eight fighters were in their respective areas of the large stage. The fighters who attracted the most attention from the crowd were Lin Qian and Lin Feng. They were curious to see how strong Lin Qian was. They were also curious to see what Qi layer was reached by Lin Feng, the Lin Clans piece of trash.\u201cI give up.\u201d Said Lin Han of the first group quite straightforwardly, which disappointed a lot of people in the crowd. Nonetheless, many of them were able to understand Lin Han. Honestly, who would have the guts to go up and fight with Lin Qian?\u201cFirst group: Lin Qian wins.\u201d Announced the Second Elder.As the first fight of the first group didn\u2019t take place, everyone\u2019s attention then focused on the battle of the fourth group.Lin Feng versus Lin Yan.\u201cI am unwilling to humiliate myself and my sword fighting against him, I give up.\u201d Said Lin Yan who had reached the seventh Qi layer and who had a sword spirit. The crowd saw that Lin Yan, who had reached the seventh Qi layer, was looking at his opponent in a very arrogant way.\u201cFourth group, Lin Yan wins.\u201dThe second elder announced the result of the fight of the fourth group.\u201cWhat?!\u201d Lin Feng was stunned. Lin Yan won by saying he gave up?!But Lin Yan seemed to think it was as it should be by right and left the arena calm and unperturbed.\u201cWhy are you still up there on the stage?\u201d asked the Second Elder to Lin Feng who wasn\u2019t moving at all.\u201cHave I given up?\u201d asked Lin Feng.The Second Elder frowned. That guy was really unable to tell good from bad. Eliminating him directly was a way to help him, not to make a fool out of himself.\u201cGiving up, not giving up, it\u2019s all the same. Hurry up and come down of the battle stage.\u201d\u201cSince I haven\u2019t given up, what gives you the right to declare Lin Yan as the winner?\u201d asked Lin Feng ignoring what the Second Elder had just said.\u201cI am the Second Elder and I am one of those in charge of leading the annual meeting.\u201d\u201cHehe, it seems like nobody is attaching importance to me, the head of the clan.\u201d Said Lin Hai calmly. He remained calm while containing his rage. \u201cSecond Elder, in the presence of every Lin Clan member currently present here, you are violating the rules of the annual meeting by immediately declaring Lin Yan\u2019s victory. What gives you the right to do so?\u201d\u201cClan Head, that battle doesn\u2019t need to take place, we all know the result already. I am helping you not to lose face by acting that way. There is no need to take it to heart.\u201d\u201cHelping me not to lose face? You are intentionally trying to make me make a fool out of myself. Now, you can come down, the Sixth Elder is now in charge of leading the battles.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t agree.\u201d Said Lin Ba Dao.\u201cI don\u2019t agree either, the Second Elder\u2019s position is justified.\u201d Said Lin Hao Ran and Lin Zhen together.\u201cDo you intend to force my hand?\u201d said Lin Hai glancing at all of them, including others who were not directly blood related to the Lin family.\u201cSo what if I want to do it this way?\u201d said Lin Hai smiling coldly.\u201cClan Head, The Second Elder hasn\u2019t made any mistake. You have no right to deprive him of his right as an organizer of the annual meeting. If you insist on having it your own way, you are just using public office to avenge private wrongs. You are just scaring everyone who is a member of the Lin Clan using your status as clan head.\u201d Said Lin Hao Ran with a smile on his face.Lin Hai smiled coldly and said in a low voice: \u201cI know what you guys want to do. You are just finding pretexts though, so I am using pretexts as well.\u201dThe ones to whom Lin Hai was referring pretended to look confused as if they didn\u2019t know what Lin Hai meant.They only saw Lin Hai turn around and begin addressing the crowd of Lin Clan members: \u201cMy son Lin Feng and Lin Yan will fight. Lin Feng hasn\u2019t given up. None of them has given up yet. By declaring Lin Yan the winner, I think that it proves that he despises the traditions of the Lin Clan. Besides, there are some people here who think that I am abusing my power to retaliate against personal enemies; that is why I am now giving an explanation to every single one of you. If Lin Feng does lose indeed, it will prove that I was wrong, and I will abdicate from my position as a Clan Head.\u201dThe crowd burst into an uproar when they heard Lin Hai\u2019s words. Lin Feng was only at the sixth Qi layer three months ago. He was maybe only at the seventh Qi layer at that moment. How was he supposed to fight against Lin Yan? Wasn\u2019t he giving the others an opportunity by acting so recklessly in regards to his son?Lin Ba Dao\u2019s eyes were sparkling with delight. He hadn\u2019t expected that Lin Hai would say these things to the crowd. Wasn\u2019t it like finding another excuse to take over the position as Clan Head?\u201cBut if Lin Feng wins, it will prove that the Second Elder really despises the traditions of the Lin Clan and I will severely punish him.\u201d Lin Hai\u2019s tone gradually changed to a much colder tone. Everybody was starting to feel a chill within the air. Lin Hai was gambling with his position as a Clan Head at stake.\u201cI agree.\u201d Lin Ba Dao immediately said. He had a calm expression on his face. How was Lin Feng supposed to win against Lin Yan?\u201cI also agree.\u201d Said Lin Zhen.\u201cAlright, what about you, Second Elder?\u201d Lin Hai said looking at him straight in the eyes.The second elder was secretly insulting him in his heart. Even if Lin Feng won, it had nothing to do with the issues going on with Lin Ba Dao and Lin Zhen. These two scoundrels had obviously agreed because they couldn\u2019t miss the opportunity to remove Lin Hai. That decision just made the Second Elder feel like they had not considered his position. He shook his head and replied: \u201cI Agree.\u201d\u201cWhat a shame.\u201d Lin Hao Ran was cursing in a low voice. Lin Feng had been able to cripple the Cultivation of his son, Lin Heng. Lin Feng was at least at the eighth Qi layer. Lin Yan would lose without doubts. He wanted to prevent them from doing it that way but Lin Ba Dao and Lin Zhen had replied too quickly. At this moment he was feeling as bad as the Second Elder.\u201cLin Yan, get on the battle stage. Go and fight Lin Feng.\u201d Said the Second Elder cold and detached while glancing at Lin Hai. Lin Hai was going to have to surrender his position as the Clan Head.Lin Yan got back on the battle stage. Sneering at Lin Feng, he said: \u201cThe piece of trash will also lose face. On top of that, you are getting your father involved in the situation. However, I, Lin Yan, will play a role in who will become the new Head of Clan, not bad!\u201d\u201cIf you use your sword the same way that you use your words, I would recommend stepping back down.\u201d\u201cDie!\u201d said Lin Yan while unsheathing his sword and throwing himself towards Lin Feng.\u201cShadow Sword\u201d\u201cGet lost!\u201d said Lin Feng calmly without raising his voice. He jumped to the side. The Qi of Lin Yan\u2019s sword immediately vanished. Right after, a fist appeared in the gap left by Lin Yan\u2019s sword and shot directly towards his chest, sending him flying through the air and off of the stage.His long sword landed on the stage. Lin Yan was lying on the ground beneath and looked utterly confused by what had happened. He had been defeated\u2026. How had he been defeated?\u201cYour sword, your speed, your accuracy, your reaction speed\u2026 You have absolutely no skill in battle. Your fighting style is full of flaws. You are a humiliation and a disgrace for both the sword you carry and the Lin Clan name. You are a piece of trash.\u201d Lin Feng kicked Lin Yan\u2019s sword and sent it flying towards Lin Yan.Not only was Lin Yan extremely confused but the whole crowd was also utterly speechless at what had happened. It was the same as three months before when Lin Feng had defeated Lin Yun. Lin Feng had only needed one hit. He had looked so relaxed and it had seemed like an extremely easy victory for him.Everybody was looking at Lin Feng. Lin Feng was self confident and even a bit arrogant at that moment. The piece of trash had completely changed to the extent that he was able to defeat Lin Yan, who was at the seventh Qi layer, in one hit.\u201cHow is that possible? How could something like this happen?\u201d asked the Second Elder whose body was trembling with fear. He could feel an ice cold glare consuming him from head to toe. The Head of the Clan, Lin Hai, was slowly walking towards him with eyes filled with killing intent.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At that moment the crowd had just noticed that Lin Hai was already on the battle stage and was approaching the second elder.\u201cWhat do I want? You haven\u2019t forgotten our deal of a moment ago, right? Lin Hai said smiling coldly.\u201cBrother please listen, The Second Elder\u2026 no\u2026. Lin Ye is a member of our clan after all\u2026 He has always worked hard and performed a valuable service for the clan. Please forgive him this time.\u201d Lin Ba Dao said loudly as he quickly tried to block Lin Hai\u2019s path.\u201cForgive him? Lin Ba Dao, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re ridiculous? A moment ago, you had all taken advantage of my son and you were completely indifferent. Did you ever ask yourself, how much I, Lin Hai, as head of the clan, have done for the benefit of the Lin clan? Are you saying that you intend to go back on your promise in front of everyone and leave that kind of impression on the young members of the clan?\u201dLin Hai\u2019s was extremely strict with his rebuke which made Lin Ba Dao embarrassed to have said anything in the first place. The entire chain of events could speak for itself. He wanted to go back on his words but had no argument as to justify his actions. If he went back on his words now then he would surely lose face.\u201cNow, move out of my way. I would like to announce that Lin Ye, Second Elder, is no longer in charge of his functions. In addition, I\u2019m going to teach him a lesson.\u201d Said Lin Hai while moving past Lin Ba Dao.\u201cIf you think things will go that smoothly then you underestimate me.\u201d Said Lin Ye while quickly turning to flee.\u201cWhoosh\u201d\u201cWhoosh.\u201dLin Hai flicked both of his sleeves lightly which caused the atmosphere to violently vibrate and become icy cold. This was followed by a groan from Lin Ye. He was trying to escape but his body had become completely stiff and he could no longer move an inch. His bones were cold and brittle to the touch. His whole body was covered in a layer of ice and his skin felt like it was burning from the cold.\u201cBOOOM!\u201dThe ice covering his body shattered causing a terrifying impact. Lin Ye\u2019s entire body was still freezing over and the ice was penetrating deep into his body. Blood was flowing out from the corner of his mouth but the warm sensation only lasted a moment before that blood would freeze solid. He collapsed onto the ground, unable to keep himself standing. His body looked like it had shrunk as he curled into a ball and rolled on the ground. He was shaking all over and all he could do was try and keep himself as warm as possible. Only his malicious looking eyes were still staring at Lin Hai. With each movement, layers of his skin which had frozen solid were breaking apart causing unbearable pain.Lin Ye wasn\u2019t a weak cultivator. He couldn\u2019t be defeated that easily by most of the clan members, but he didn\u2019t dare fight against Lin Hai. Lin Hai was like an unmovable mountain, he was unable to tell how strong Lin Hai was exactly, but fighting him was courting death.Many people watched the scene like statues, unmoving with mouths wide open in shock. They hadn\u2019t expected that Lin Hai would be so powerful and even use his powers in cruel ways. It was clear that Lin Ye had enraged the head of the clan and was being punished for it. It was also a clear warning, by showing just how easily he could deal with an elder of the clan, he was warning those who plotted against him that they would be risking their lives. After all, the Second Elder was Lin Ba Dao\u2019s assistant.\u201cNow, lets continue with the annual meeting, I assign the Sixth Elder to take over from where Lin Ye failed. If you cannot follow clan rules or want to refuse then tell me now.\u201d Said Lin Hai while rolling up his sleeve which made him look incredibly imposing.Lin Feng was looking at his father full of admiration, he was smiling from ear to ear. His father was so strong and in this world only the strong deserved respect. Lin Hai didn\u2019t usually give such displays of his strength, this was not because he was not strong enough but rather he did not enjoy needless displays of strength.Nobody dared to call into question what Lin Hai had done to an elder of the clan. Even though Lin Ba Dao and Lin Zhen were furious, they just had to contain their anger and stay silent.The battles continued. Lin Feng was the strongest of the fourth group. Only Lin Yu was at the eighth Qi layer, all the others were at the seventh Qi layer. Six battles later, nobody had been able to take a single blow from the piece of trash, Lin Feng. There was only Lin Yu and Lin Feng left to fight within the fourth group.As far as the other groups were concerned, in the first group, Lin Qian hadn\u2019t fought a single battle, all her opponents had given up before even attempting to fight. In the second and the third group, Lin Hong as well as Lin Wu were undefeated. They had won all their battles as expected. There was another disciple who stood out and his name was Lin Hen. Nobody had expected him to be that strong as there was not much known about his strength previously. He had won all of his battles, but unfortunately he had to fight Lin Wu next. Many clan members thought it would be a good experience to humble him.Finally the rankings were already in place and soon the third round would begin. The last battles of the third and fourth group were taking place. However the top eight clan members had already been decided.\u201cThird group: Lin Wu versus Lin Hen. Fourth group: Lin Feng versus Lin Yu.\u201d Announced the Sixth Elder. Everybody looked very interested again. These four cultivators were all undefeated in their previous matches. They wanted to see how long Lin Hen would last against Lin Wu. The majority of the crowd was focused on watching to see if Lin Feng would be able to defeat Lin Yu who had already reached the eighth Qi layer.The crowd erupted in cheers for the upcoming fights. Lin Hen was fighting with Lin Wu who was one of the best junior cultivators of the Lin Clan. This would surely be a great battle to watch.They had been shocked by Lin Feng but they didn\u2019t expect much from him as he was previously only sixth Qi Layer. He could have only reached the seventh Qi layer at most or maybe had just broken through to the eighth Qi layer. How was he supposed to be win against Lin Yu who was already at the peak of the eighth Qi layer? Many members of the clan still had trouble removing the previous association of Lin Feng being useless and a piece of trash. So many assumed he would surrender his next fight.The four practitioners stepped onto the arena. Lin Hen was pretty straight forward, he cupped his hands before his chest as a sign of respect and said: \u201cWe have already qualified for the third round, we do not need to fight unnecessary battles with other clan members.\u201d\u201cEven though we already qualify for the next round, I, Lin Wu, always welcome a fight. I want to show everyone who the strongest of our group is.\u201d Said Lin Wu while shaking his head in refusal.\u201cI Surrender.\u201d Said Lin Hen while smiling and completely ignoring Lin Wu\u2019s wishes to fight.\u201cLin Wu wins.\u201d Said the Sixth Elder with a wry smile. It was his son that had just given up\u2026\u201cCoward.\u201d Lin Wu said insulting Lin Hen, then turned around and left. On stage there was only Lin Feng and Lin Yu left.\u201cHehe, finally. Lin Yu will fight that piece of trash. I hope that Lin Yu can teach him a good lesson.\u201d Said Lin Ba Dao in an ice cold tone. He had thought that Lin Feng would get crippled during the second round but he hadn\u2019t expected that Lin Feng had actually become so strong in such a short period. He was no longer weak, like many had thought. He hadn\u2019t lost a single battle so far in the fourth group and had not even used more than a single strike.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Lin Yu is a true member of the Lin Clan, he will definitely show that piece of trash what it means to be strong.\u201d Said the Third Elder confidently. He was very confident about his son\u2019s abilities and skills. It would be difficult for Lin Yu to finish amongst the top three at the end of the annual meeting but he was hopeful that his son would finish amongst the top five within the younger generation.\u201cLet\u2019s watch and enjoy the show.\u201d Said Lin Ba Dao while nodding.Lin Yu\u2019s confident expression had vanished but he still tried to keep his head calm. He couldn\u2019t forget that moment when Lin Feng had slapped him. He hated Lin Feng bitterly for that but at the same time, he was also terrified of the monster that stood before him. That piece of trash that was also the clan\u2019s young master, had changed into a mysterious beast. Gu Song wasn\u2019t weak but had been injured and thrown out of the window by Lin Feng. Lin Yan could use his sword with great skill but when he battled with Lin Feng, his sword had looked like a toy in the hands of a child. Lin Yu didn\u2019t have even have a small amount of self confidence in beating Lin Feng.He could feel the pressure created by the entire audience staring at him, Lin Yu could not help but gulp with the amazing pressure he was under. He really was stuck between a rock and a hard place. Everybody was waiting for him to teach Lin Feng a lesson, including his own father but did he even have the power to do such a thing?\u201cSince we\u2019re already qualified for the next round, do we really need to fight?\u201d asked Lin Yu in a very soft voice.Lin Feng had a fake smile on his face and kept glaring at Lin Yu yet remained silent.\u201cBastard.\u201d Thought Lin Yu. He then took a deep breath and said: \u201cI give up.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dThe Third Elder as well as the crowd were all stupefied when they heard Lin Yu.\u201cDid he just give up\u2026?\u201dAt the moment when everyone couldn\u2019t wait to see Lin Feng be taught a lesson, Lin Yu surprisingly acted the same way as Lin Hen and chose not to battle.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Lin Ba Dao asked looking extremely puzzled.\u201cMaybe Lin Yu wants to humiliate him during the finals.\u201d Guessed the Third Elder without being convinced of his own words.The second round finished. The top clan members were Lin Qian, Lin Hong, Lin Feng, Lin Yu, Lin Wu, Lin Hen, Lin Ying as well as Lin Li.The third round was also the finals. It consisted of one-on-one battles.Lin Ying and Lin Li were staring at Lin Feng with longing eyes. They were praying to fight against Lin Feng, they had no grudge with Lin Feng, they had only wanted to guarantee a spot in the top four.\u201cFirst battle: Lin Qian versus Lin Ying.\u201d Said the Sixth Elder. Lin Ying\u2019s face turned white in a second. That was the unluckiest situation he could be in. He was assigned to fight the strongest of all the young clan members.\u201cLin Qian, even though I probably will not be able to touch you even once, I still wish to fight. I hope that you can show me how great the distance between us is.\u201dShe had no other choice but to fight against Lin Qian. That was going to be her last battle. Everybody was aware that she was definitely going to lose, but she would not surrender her pride.\u201cI will.\u201d Replied Lin Qian cold and detached to the extent that she even looked somewhat arrogant.\u201cLet\u2019s Begin!\u201d shouted Lin Ying advancing towards Lin Qian. She didn\u2019t even release her spirit. She was going to lose in any case, but this was a matter of the Lin Clans pride. She only wanted to see how strong Lin Qian was so she could aim to one day be as strong as her.\u201cIce.\u201d Shouted Lin Qian. Lin Ying\u2019s hand hadn\u2019t even touched Lin Qian yet but her hand was already feeling extremely heavy as if it weighed one thousand jin and the speed had dropped drastically.In an instant, Lin Qian\u2019s tiny hand was already on Lin Ying, whose body was already covered with a layer of frost.\u201cYou lose.\u201d Lin Qian shook her hand and Lin Ying immediately collapsed onto the ground. Lin Ying was shaking on the ground from the cold. She looked similar to the Second Elder a moment ago, but much less pitiful.\u201cHow strong! So that what a cultivator of the Ling Qi layer is capable of. What a power! Good thing that I don\u2019t have to fight against Lin Qian.\u201d Said the others who felt lucky they didn\u2019t have to fight against Lin Qian.\u201cFirst battle: Lin Qian wins. Second battle: Lin Hong versus Lin Yu.\u201d Announced the Sixth elder.\u201cI give up.\u201d Said Lin Yu making a wry smile. He was obviously not going to fight against Lin Hong. He hadn\u2019t thought he would successively give up twice. He was eliminated.\u201cSecond battle: Lin Hong wins. Third battle: Lin Feng versus Lin Li.\u201d\u201cPheww, awesome.\u201d Lin Li had a big smile on his face. Lin Li was at the peak of the eighth Qi layer. He thought all the others would be quite hard to defeat but Lin Feng should be an easy win.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34 - The Final Eight (Part 2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySecond release here for you all. Special thank you goes to Joseph G &amp; Eddy R. Joseph told me not to tire myself out, he is clearly not supporting your addiction\u2026KILL!!! hehe Special thanks to him for supporting the chapters and looking out for me xoxoI hope you enjoy this one. I made sure it was a cliffhanger, because I know you all love Cliffhangers. ????\u201cIt seems like today is my lucky day.\u201d Said Lin Li while getting onto the battle stage and facing Lin Feng.Lin Feng was completely expressionless. When he saw Lin Li\u2019s resplendent smile, he thought: \u201cLucky Day, eh?\u201d Lin Li was maybe going to think differently a short instant later.Lin Feng did seem to be very lucky to most of the clan members watching the annual meeting. During the first round, Lin Qian had helped him to move into the next round. During the second round, the strongest of the group, Lin Yu, had given up and shown him mercy. It had been so easy for him that he did not even have the chance to show his full strength and many believed he had recently broke into the eighth Qi Layer. And even during the third round, he was still extremely lucky, his first fight was against the weakest of all the remaining participants: Lin Li. He would still not have the chance to show his strength.\u201cMaybe the Sixth Elder had arranged things that way.\u201d Thought Lin Feng.\u201cYou can attack first, okay? Let\u2019s have a good fight\u201d said Lin Li as if he had already won the fight and was selecting his next opponent.\u201cAlright.\u201d Said Lin Feng while nodding.\u201cMoonlight Feather Agility, Nine Heavy Waves.\u201d Shouted Lin Feng. As Lin Feng arrived right next to Lin Li, Lin Li was still smiling.The shock waves within the air caused a huge pressure to consume the atmosphere. Terrifying wave upon terrifying wave was vibrating through the air around Lin Feng\u2019s fist. Lin Li\u2019s smile was still on his face but at the same time he looked terrified, he had planned to withstand the attack and then win by showing overwhelming strength but now he was terrified of his opponent. Wasn\u2019t it too late to take his words back?\u201cBOOOM!!\u201d\u201cYou Lose.\u201dLin Li\u2019s body flew away. His smile was almost rigid on his face and that looked really embarrassing. One punch, one punch was all it had taken to eliminate him. He no longer believed he was lucky.\u201cIt seems like nobody has put Lin Feng in their eyes. How strong is he?\u201d thought Lin Li.Only Lin Feng knew how powerful his attacks could become. It seemed like his nine heavy waves were in perfect fusion with the entire universe surrounding them, they even seemed to borrow the power of the atmosphere as it was consumed by the vibrations. His waves gave the impression of being in the middle of a vast and boundless ocean which nobody could escape. There was no choice but to be swallowed by the powerful waves.The most terrifying thing was that Lin Feng hadn\u2019t received a single injury in any of his fights. Lin Feng\u2019s effortlessly dodged all incoming attacks and dealt with his opponent with a single blow. There was not even a speck of dust on his robes, he was untouchable.\u201cPiece of trash\u2026..Is this what we call a true genius?\u201d Lin Li didn\u2019t have the least bit of hate or resentment in his eyes. He was staring at Lin Feng with respect and even a hint of remaining fear. He knew that Lin Feng had shown him mercy and was terrified by the outcome if he had not received mercy.\u201cLin Feng wins.\u201d Declared the Sixth Elder. The crowd deeply sighed.\u201cIt had to be a trick. Lin Li was at the eighth Qi layer. This must have been something which was previously arranged. He is truly cunning\u201d\u201cWhat Qi Layer is Lin Feng even at?\u201dThe entire crowd suddenly had the impression that the piece of trash they were looking at had completely transformed and become something mysterious. He had either become extremely sly and cunning or held the strength of eighth Qi Layer. No matter which it was, he had gained the curiosity and respect of many clan members.\u201cHe took him by surprise with a sneak attack. That piece of trash is the same piece of trash as before. He\u2019s just a coward.\u201d Said Lin Wu in an extremely disdainful tone when he heard all the comments of the crowd.\u201cThat\u2019s right. It must be that way. Lin Feng could only win with a sneak attack because Lin Li was unprepared. Otherwise, how could he have thrown Lin Li from the stage that easily?\u201d said some clan members in support of Lin WuThey thought that they had understood what had happened from Lin Wu\u2019s words and some people had even started insulting Lin Feng.But Lin Feng ignored the comments as this was nothing he had not heard previously, however now he would make them all pay. All those who had humiliated him would be punished. A piece of trash? Took him by surprise? Everyone will be disappointed.Fourth battle: Lin Wu versus Lin Hen.While looking at them on the battle stage, Lin Feng\u2019s eyes showed curiosity. During the last round, Lin Wu and Lin Hen were in the same group but during the last fight of their group, Lin Hen had refused to fight and surrendered. But this round, Lin Hen and Lin Wu were opponents again, could it be that the Sixth Elder had done this on purpose?\u201cWe have already made it this far, we do not need to fight unnecessary battles with other clan members. Do we even need to fight?\u201d said Lin Wu jokingly while looking at Lin Hen. Lin Hen was just a coward scared to fight, nothing more.\u201cThere is no need.\u201d Replied Lin Hen while shaking his head and smiling.\u201cSuch a coward.\u201d\u201cHe is making the Lin Clan lose face.\u201dMany people started to insult him. Lin Hen had already qualified before when he gave up so that was excusable, but giving up now was really unforgivable. That was a disgrace to the Lin Clan.\u201cCoward. If you\u2019re not fighting then get lost! Get down off the battle stage.\u201d Said Lin Wu who was really angry to hear him give up again.Lin Hen was looking at Lin Wu and suddenly had a strange expression on his face. He didn\u2019t get down off the battle stage, instead, he moved forwards to Lin Wu.\u201cI will just count down from three to one, if you don\u2019t get off my stage before the time is up, then do not blame me for being merciless.\u201d Said Lin Hen.Killing intent could be seen on his face. Suddenly a powerful chaotic energy surrounded his body and crashed down onto Lin Wu.\u201cThree.\u201d Counted Lin Hen.At that moment, Lin Wu\u2019s entire body was trembling, he looked like he was frozen with fear. Sweat was beading from his forehead and his face could show his fatigue. He was staring at Lin Hen with eyes filled with shock.\u201cHow is that even possible? How did you possibly?!\u201d Lin Wu was going insane: \u201cHow can you have the strength of a cultivator who has reached the Ling Qi Layer?!\u201dLin Wu wasn\u2019t the only one who was stupefied. Everyone else in the crowd was stupefied. Ling Qi layer. He has just used the power belonging to cultivators of the Ling Qi layer. That quiet and introverted Lin Hen had been hiding his power this whole time. Everyone was shocked at how this young man had hidden such a great power.Ling Qi layer\u2026 apart from Lin Qian, amongst the juniors, it seemed like there was only Lin Hen who had broken through to the Ling Qi layer\u2026 and it seemed like Lin Qian was the most outstanding of all the young disciples.The Sixth Elder was beaming with satisfaction. He had a huge smile on his face. Lin Hen had been secretly cultivating and hiding his abilities. As long as he didn\u2019t show his abilities, it was very difficult for others to tell that he had reached the Ling Qi layer. Which showed how careful he had been to hide his power.\u201cHe is good at hiding his real power.\u201d Lin Ba Dao thought while looking at the Sixth Elder. But suddenly he realized there was still hope.\u201cYou better adapt to the circumstances.\u201d Said Lin Ba Dao looking at the Sixth Elder with a cold smile. Once the annual meeting was over, he would again attempt to become the Head of the Clan. Lin Ba Dao couldn\u2019t understand why the previous head on his deathbed, had passed his power to Lin Hai and not to him. Lin Hai was seldom in the Clan when he was young, he would often travel and hide from the clan his destination. Lin Ba Dao was a pillar of the Clan and had dedicated his life to it.Becoming the Head of the Clan had always been Lin Ba Dao\u2019s dream and because he continued to fail at his attempts, there was a knot in his heart.\u201cTwo.\u201d Lin Hen\u2019s energy was becoming stronger and stronger. It was oppressing Lin Wu so much that he could hardly breathe. He had never felt such a horrible pressure and he regretted his previous arrogance.Everybody believed that Lin Wu was at the eighth Qi layer but he had actually broken through to the ninth Qi layer not long before. He had thought that he would amaze everyone at this year\u2019s annual meeting but his dream hadn\u2019t come to reality. He had not been given the chance to show anything exceptional to the audience. Lin Hen was threatening him at that moment and telling him to leave while he still could, otherwise he would have to bear the consequences.\u201cBefore you insult and humiliate other people, you better think twice. I am not willing to fight against you for the sake of the clan. It is not because I am less powerful than you. I despise you and if it were not for the blood we share, I would kill you where you stand\u201d Said Lin Hen. He seemed like a completely different person. The power of the chaotic energy was still increasing and Lin Heng was about to make his final count.\u201c\u2014-\u201c\u201cI give up.\u201d Said Lin Wu who felt that he was about to be crushed by the force of the chaotic energy. Then he turned around and left the battle stage without looking back.\u201cLin Hen is so strong!\u201d said the crowd as if they were worshiping him. Breaking through to the Ling Qi layer is the dream of every young Cultivator. Reaching it before the age of twenty gave even more chances to break through to even higher layers later such as the Xuan Qi layer or even the extremely powerful Sky Qi layer.\u201cVery interesting.\u201d Said Lin Feng who was laughing. Lin Hen had broken through to the Ling Qi layer\u2026 The Sixth Elder had probably voluntarily arranged the battles like he did to promote his own son\u2019s fame. Lin Hen had given up during the second round so he really wanted to see Lin Hen fight Lin Wu during the third round. He was happy that Lin Wu had been taught a lesson in front of such a large crowd. He even surrendered like a coward, which he was calling Lin Hen previously.\u201cPiece of trash, what gives you the right to laugh at me? You\u2019re the disgrace of the clan.\u201d Lin Wu\u2019s expression was hideous when he saw Lin Feng\u2019s smile. He couldn\u2019t help but shout at him extremely loudly, to the extent that his shout resonated in the entire fighting arena.When people heard that Lin Wu was shouting at Lin Feng, they couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter.Especially Lin Ba Dao who said: \u201cLin Wu had lost against Lin Hen who had reached the Ling Qi layer so he hadn\u2019t lost face at all, but I wouldn\u2019t have thought that a piece of trash would dare laugh at him. He really shameless, he\u2019s truly a disgrace.\u201dWhen Lin Zhen heard these few words, he directly felt much better and said in a cold tone: \u201cThat piece of trash is overestimating his capabilities.\u201dLin Hai who wasn\u2019t far from them had an extremely cold expression and was repressing the urge to kill them on the spot.Lin Feng was stupefied. He clearly hadn\u2019t thought that Lin Wu had anything to be angry about, he had just been unlucky to have provoked the wrong person with his arrogance. Why would he then try to bully him?\u201cWhat are you looking at, piece of trash? Instead of hiding behind your daddy, wouldn\u2019t you prefer fighting against me?\u201d Lin Wu was so furious that there was no space in his heart to contain his wrath so he used Lin Feng to release all his anger.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time that I see such a ridiculous and laughable person. You just got humiliated because of your own arrogance so you are attempting to bully me. Pathetic.\u201dLin Feng shook his head and then moved towards Lin Wu.\u201cI will just count down from three to one, if you do not leave my sight, then do not blame me for being merciless\u201dLin Feng had used almost the same words as Lin Hen. The entire area suddenly turned silent. Only Lin Feng\u2019s voice could be heard.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 - To The Death! - Lin Feng Vs Lin QianPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySpecial Thanks to Joseph G AGAIN!!! likyliky &amp; anonymous. They have sponsored this chapter, so please thank them!I will try to get the 4th release edited and released shortly.Enjoy xoxoEveryone watching felt confused by Lin Feng\u2019s actions, Lin Hen had already broken through to the Ling Qi layer so it was normal for him to threaten Lin Wu.But Lin Feng was doing the same now and was telling Lin Wu to get out of his sight. The previous shame and humiliation had already made Lin Wu enraged. He had been humiliated by Lin Hen and hadn\u2019t felt anger but the fact that that piece of trash dared to humiliate him was unbearable. He felt like a knife was stabbing his heart and his anger could be seen on his bright red face.\u201cDo you want to die?\u201d Lin Wu was releasing clear killing intent and his gaze was like a wild beast.At that moment an extremely strong force surrounded Lin Wu and came crashing down onto him, even though it wasn\u2019t as strong as Lin Hen\u2019s chaotic energy, Lin Wu once again felt fear fill his heart. He had once again been surrounded by an oppressive force that was crushing down onto his whole body.\u201cThree.\u201d Lin Feng started the countdown in a low voice. The power of the force which was crushing Lin Wu\u2019s body was growing stronger and stronger over time. Lin Wu was almost suffocating from the energy filling the atmosphere. All his feelings, wrath, shame, resentment suddenly all vanished. The only feeling he had left was fear and self preservation.He was at the ninth Qi layer and the piece of trash which was facing him was using energy strong enough to suppress him. Was he also Ling Qi Layer?Everybody was confused, they only saw that Lin Wu was suddenly panicked and gasping for breath. Lin Feng was walking slowly and calmly towards Lin Wu which gave everyone the impression that time had stopped. Even if the crowd could sense the Qi contained within the force which was released by Lin Feng, it was in perfect harmony with the elements.Lin Feng looked like a completely different person in the eyes of the Lin Clan members. Lin Feng seemed to be in perfect balance with the elements and forces between heaven and earth.\u201cTwo.\u201d Said Lin Feng while taking another step forward. Even if he wasn\u2019t shouting, his words felt like a hammer stroking Lin Wu\u2019s chest. Lin Wu\u2019s heart was pounding. He could only think of ways to flee this current situation. However he could barely move.The force had become much stronger than the initial pressure. Lin Wu was still feeling extremely oppressed and at the same time was trying to escape backwards. It didn\u2019t even look like a battle was happening. It looked ridiculous, his confidence had disappeared even though Lin Feng had only taken two steps forward.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Lin Wu is trying to escape?\u201d whispered members who were watching the events.\u201cI really think that Lin Feng has unlocked his hidden talent, can he really be called trash anymore? It\u2019s almost as if he has unsheathed a sword and is cutting down the pride of anyone who was trying to obstruct his way.\u201d\u201cThere is one last word left.\u201d Said Lin Feng while smiling at Lin Wu but it seemed like Lin Feng was making fun of Lin Wu. Lin Wu, was a true coward in every sense of the word, when faced with the pressure stronger than his own, he never even attempted to fight.Lin Wu had a spear in his hand which fell down onto the ground. He looked very weak and fragile. Lin Hen hadn\u2019t needed to humiliate him that much, he knew himself that his strength wasn\u2019t sufficient to fight back against the Ling Qi Layer. Lin Feng\u2019s force though had completely destroyed his self confidence and humiliated him much worse than Lin Hen. He had the feeling that he was never truly strong and the strength he had was just a fantasy created by his arrogance when bullying the weak. That kind of humiliation was truly scary and would take root deep inside the subconscious, making any advancements in the path of cultivation much more difficult.\u201cI give up.\u201d Said Lin Wu while biting his lips. He seemed to gain a small insight into the world. He used to regard himself as infallible, he believed he was extremely powerful and because of that he was extremely arrogant. He couldn\u2019t bear thinking about how he used to be.\u201cGive up?\u201d said Lin Feng while smiling. \u201cI said to get out of my sight. Since I can still see you, I will give you one last chance to get out of my sight by crawling on your belly like the worm you are.\u201dHe was humiliating him over and over again. Could the anger that he felt be satisfied with only words?If Lin Wu had been able to defeat Lin Feng, Lin Feng would have been humiliated and endlessly bullied. Lin Wu would have never let him off so easily\u2026 but when Lin Wu found out that he couldn\u2019t defeat Lin Feng then he would just give up, were these words really enough? What about the horrible things he had said before? Could they be forgotten that easily?It was obviously impossible. Lin Feng wasn\u2019t a sage, he was just an ordinary young man, an ordinary young man with feelings such as hate, love, courage and revenge.\u201cI give up. Isn\u2019t it enough? You really want me to crawl away?\u201d Lin Wu was furious and had started yelling again.\u201cIs giving up enough to make us even? You call me a piece of trash, the disgrace of the Lin Clan\u2026 how should I punish you for your insults. Do you think it\u2019s enough? You got humiliated by him and then take it out on me. Do you think it\u2019s enough?\u201d said Lin Feng while smiling coldly. \u201cNow you realize that you cannot compete with me and only say a few words and you think it\u2019s enough. Are you looking to die today?\u201dLin Wu was extremely scared.\u201cIt seems like time has come.\u201d Lin Feng had a smile on his face. \u201cI will give you one last chance. If you do not get out of my sight, you will bear the consequences of your actions.\u201dWhile saying this, Lin Feng kept moving forwards. Lin Wu groaned and immediately laid down on the ground. He looked extremely ashamed and weak.Lin Feng had an aura which was filled with killing intent which left Lin Wu extremely frightened. Regardless of his feelings of shame and resentment, Lin Feng\u2019s killing intent scared him back to reality. He has never felt such a murderous intent before, it was truly terrifying.\u201cI\u2019ll get out of your sight.\u201d Said Lin Wu while forcing a smile. His smile was filled with regret and shame. He crawled on the ground away from Lin Feng.\u201cPiece of trash. Disgrace of the Clan.\u201d\u201cThat piece of trash is the same piece of trash as before.\u201dWhile crawling on the ground, Lin Wu remembered all the horrible names and insults he had given Lin Feng. He knew that he was acting like a fool. He was at the ninth Qi layer, he was an outstanding disciple and one of the clans future stars, why had he ended up being so petty?Everybody in the crowd was looking at Lin Wu crawling on the ground. They couldn\u2019t believe their eyes. They only thought that Lin Feng was insane, suddenly demanding Lin Wu to crawl on the ground and get out of his sight. They wouldn\u2019t have thought that he had meant it or that Lin Wu would actually do it.\u201cLin Wu.\u201d Said Lin Zhen. He was shaking. How did such an event come to pass? His son should have the same prideful expression on his face that he always had, he should be the pride of the Clan, a true genius who is just a little weaker than Lin Qian\u2026 but in such a short time, Lin Wu had been humiliated twice, to the extent that the second time, he was crawling on the ground like a worm.\u201cBastard.\u201d Lin Zhen was furious. He wanted to kill Lin Feng on the spot.\u201cUugh.\u201dLin Hai lazily sighed when he saw that Lin Zhen was furious. It seemed like the entire space was growing colder, ready to punish Lin Zhen for any actions he made.\u201cCalm down.\u201d Lin Ba Dao had noticed that Lin Zhen was furious and apathetically added: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, that piece of trash will not be arrogant for much longer.\u201dLin Zhen was still as furious as before. He stared at Lin Hai and then sat down. He knew that he could not do as he pleased as long as Lin Hai was there.\u201cLin Feng wins.\u201d Said the Sixth Elder while staring at Lin Feng.Lin Feng wasn\u2019t like the great majority of the junior members of the Lin Clan. He hadn\u2019t inherited a fire or ice spirit, instead he had inherited a small snake spirit. But that small snake spirit wasn\u2019t like a normal beast spirit. Nobody knew what use it had, it didn\u2019t seem to be that strong or powerful. Because they could not sense its power and did not know the uses of such a spirit, it was deemed a trash spirit. That is why Lin Feng was called a piece of trash by everyone. He was regarded as a disgrace.Lin Feng also practiced at an extremely slow pace on the path of cultivation which made him even more infamous within the clan. Everybody despised him. But that piece of trash had defeated Lin Yan and had made Lin Wu, who considered himself above ordinary members of the clan, crawl on the ground like a worm. Was he still the piece of trash he used to be? Was his spirit really useless?\u201cWhen the father is a dragon, the son can never be a snake.\u201d Thought the Sixth Elder. He then said \u201cHave a rest for half an hour and then we\u2019ll continue with the upcoming battles.\u201d\u201cElder, we four are not tired, we don\u2019t need to rest. Let\u2019s continue now, please.\u201d Said Lin Qian in a nonchalant way. Even if she was extremely arrogant towards the other members of the Lin Clan, she was slightly more polite recently. Elders of the Lin Clan didn\u2019t mind her being arrogant but Chu Zhan Peng did not like her arrogance, she was being taught to not be arrogant to those who are stronger than her.\u201cMy sister is right, let\u2019s continue now.\u201d Added Lin Hong. Both brother and sister had reached the semifinals. This day was a wonderful one for Lin Ba Dao and his standing within the clan. This would make his attempt to become clan head go very smoothly.The Sixth Elder looked at Lin Feng: \u201cWhat is your opinion?\u201dRegarding his son, Lin Hen, he already knew his opinion. Which only left Lin Feng.\u201cNo problem, we can continue.\u201d Said Lin Feng while nodding. Until that moment, he hadn\u2019t really used his power anyway.\u201cIf you\u2019re all alright with it, then let\u2019s continue right now.\u201d Declared the Sixth Elder. \u201cThe semifinals will be as such: Lin Feng versus Lin Hong and Lin Qian versus Lin Hen. Lin Feng and Lin Hong, you can start first.\u201d\u201cThe Sixth Elder unexpectedly made Lin Hen fight against Lin Qian. He must really expect a lot from him.\u201d\u201cLin Hen is at the same level as Lin Qian, they have both broken through to the Ling Qi layer. Lin Hong is also extremely strong but couldn\u2019t compete with them. As far as Lin Feng is concerned, it\u2019s also impossible for him to defeat Lin Hen. Only Lin Qian could compete with him. The Sixth Elder probably thinks like that and that\u2019s why he arranged the battles that way. The way the battles are arranged is not important anyway, what is important is strength.\u201dEverybody was making all sorts of comments on the matchups. But at that time, Lin Ba Dao stood up and said in a clear loud voice: \u201cSixth Elder, would you allow me to say a few words?\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Said the Sixth Elder while nodding.\u201cThese four juniors are at the highest ranks of this year\u2019s annual meeting, they represent the new generation of our Lin Clan and its future prospects. I think that forfeiting should be declared invalid. Only fighting until one of them can no longer continue, they should fight like true warriors of the Lin Clan until the end. That way, they will be forced to fully exploit their potential and perhaps even gain insight towards their path of cultivation.\u201d Said Lin Ba Dao with assurance while looking at Lin Hai every once in a while as if he was trying to provoke him.\u201cHow cruel. It seems like he really wants Lin Hong to cripple Lin Feng.\u201d Said some members of the crowd. They had all understood Lin Ba Dao\u2019s thoughts. They could tell that he had nothing but cruel intentions.\u201cClan Head, what do you think about my proposal?\u201d Lin Ba Dao asked Lin Hai who had the feeling that Lin Ba Dao was constantly positioning his knife behind Lin Hai\u2019s back with the words \u201cClan Head\u201d. He was smiling at Lin Hai. If Lin Hai didn\u2019t accept, Lin Feng would lose face. If he did accept and Lin Feng lost, that would ruin the reputation of his family. Lin Ba Dao had seized this opportunity to destroy his competition.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Lin Feng had already shown more strength than expected. He felt gratified but Lin Ba Dao\u2019s proposal was insane. Even if Lin Feng managed to defeat Lin Hong, what would happen during the final? Lin Ba Dao wanted to see Lin Feng die by the hands of one of his children.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? The Head of my Clan cannot show some courage and resolution. Allow our juniors to show what they are capable of in a real battle.\u201d Lin Ba Dao said when he saw that Lin Hai was hesitant and not replying.\u201cFather, hurry up and accept.\u201d Said Lin FengLin Feng couldn\u2019t help but shiver a little bit. Lin Feng\u2019s family had never done wrong to Lin Ba Dao\u2019s family and had never considered them as enemies, they even considered them as close relatives but Lin Ba Dao\u2019s family was constantly trying to manipulate Lin Hai and would constantly make attempts on Lin Feng\u2019s life. Since they wanted to do things in such a way, Lin Feng\u2019s would have to return the favor.Lin Hai looked at Lin Ba Dao\u2019s expression. He looked extremely confident. Lin Hai just said one word: \u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cAlright, Lin Hai definitely deserves to be the Head of the Clan. He\u2019s brave. Since the Clan Head has agreed, let\u2019s get started! Sixth Elder, allow Lin Qian and Lin Hen to fight first, please.\u201d Lin Ba Dao looked high-spirited and vigorous. He was feeling very satisfied. Since Lin Hai had accepted, everyone just had to wait and see.\u201cOk.\u201d Said the Sixth Elder while nodding.\u201cYou should give up. You cannot defeat me.\u201d Said Lin Qian while getting on the fighting stage. She was dusting off her red robes which remained untouched, she looked insufferably arrogant.\u201cEven if I cannot defeat you, we still have to fight to determine the results.\u201d Lin Hen said preparing to start fighting. He released his fire spirit and the atmosphere became unbelievably hot. Heat roared from the stage and the whole crowd could feel warmth on their faces.\u201cYour spirit has also awakened, not bad. What a pity though that it\u2019s only a fire spirit. It isn\u2019t worth much. You still won\u2019t have a chance when fighting against me.\u201d Said Lin Qian in a cold and detached tone. On the path of Cultivation, one of the major steps was to reach the Ling Qi layer and then to have one\u2019s spirit awaken. Some people\u2019s spirit became much stronger when it awoke and where as some spirits did not vary much from others and were just average strength.After being awakened, Lin Qian\u2019s universal ice and fire spirit had become infinitely stronger. Her control over the elements of ice and fire had reached new heights.Her universal ice and fire spirit appeared behind her back. The clear ice was covered in flames. The raging flames were covering the ice and the fire seemed to be emitting frost at the same time. The atmosphere was sometimes extremely hot, sometimes extremely cold, it was an extremely strange feeling for the crowd who continued to feel the altering temperatures.\u201cI had heard that Lin Qian\u2019s universal ice and fire spirit was about to awaken. It wasn\u2019t only a rumor. It really is an awakened spirit. She really is the genius of the Lin Clan. Lin Feng, that piece of trash, is not even worthy of her attention.\u201d\u201cExactly. No wonder so many of the elders support her. Besides, the universal ice and fire spirit is a high class spirit. She can practice fire as well as ice techniques. Which can also greatly improve her agility techniques, by combining knowledge of fire and ice based techniques and using them simultaneously. She will definitely become a powerful practitioner.\u201dWhen Lin Ba Dao heard these clan members whisper about his daughter, he couldn\u2019t help but have a huge smile on his face. All the elders next to him were also smiling.\u201cEverlasting Snow!\u201dLin Qian had said in an apathetic tone. The ground turned into ice. A white fog was rising in all directions and formed clouds which emanated an icy aura.Ice has a restraining effect on fire, therefore Lin Qian had used an ice skill to counter Lin Hen.\u201cScorching Magma.\u201d Shouted Lin Hen. He opened his hand and there was a blazing hot fireball in his palm.\u201cIce Spike.\u201d Said Lin Qian contented and not scared at all. Ice collapsed into Lin Hen\u2019s hand and in an instant, his hand was enclosed within a layer of ice.\u201cIgnite.\u201d Said Lin Hen while coughing because of the ice within the air which hurt his lungs. The ice turned into vapor which froze the air making it hard to breathe. Lin Hen\u2019s hand was extreme painful, he couldn\u2019t tell exactly where the pain was but he had the feeling his head was going to explode.\u201cBOOOM!\u201dA sudden explosion and Lin Hen was sent flying backwards. The center of his palm was burned black. The flesh and blood of his hand was in terrible shape.\u201cLin Hen.\u201d Said the Sixth Elder with worry.\u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201d Said Lin Hen while biting his lip. He was shivering and his jaw could not stop moving, one could hear the sound of his clacking teeth. He was enduring a strong and violent pain. The pain in his hand was agonizing as the ice was trying to freeze the wound causing even greater pain.\u201cWe will have a rematch in the future.\u201d Said Lin Hen while staring at Lin Qian. He then turned around and left. It made his father sigh. Even though Lin Hen wasn\u2019t really naturally talented, he was extremely determined and stubborn. He wanted to become a man of overwhelming power. Even if he did not have talent, he would work harder than anyone else to become strong.\u201cYou will never be able to defeat me, give up on trying.\u201d Said Lin Qian arrogant as always. She was going to be so strong in the future that nobody in the Lin Clan would be able to compete with her. If no one could touch her now, how would they in the future when she grew stronger with her spirit.\u201cUniversal fire and ice spirit\u2026 She is able to use two elements of antagonistic power in the blink of an eye. Her potential will continue to increase.\u201d Lin Hai was frowning. The stronger Lin Qian was, the more dangerous it became for Lin Feng.\u201cIt\u2019s your turn.\u201d Said Lin Qian while smiling coldly at Lin Feng and then came down off the battle stage.Lin Feng raised his head and looked at the clear and boundless sky and the sun.Lin Feng was walking slowly towards the battle stage and then stepped onto it. Lin Hong was already waiting for him there.\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this opportunity for a long time.\u201d Said Lin Hong while looking at Lin Feng.\u201cI know.\u201d Said Lin Feng while nodding.\u201cYou never had a single hope for victory. You are going to fight me now but even if you had fought against Lin Qian, it would have been the same, there was never any chance for you to come out of the unscathed.\u201dLin Feng just laughed. Lin Hong had so much self confidence that surrounded him like an aura. Lin Feng, in his eyes, had no value.\u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d asked Lin Hong. \u201cDo you think that because you won against Lin Wu, you can compete with me? If you believe we are the same then you are still too immature and overestimate your abilities.\u201d\u201cJust go ahead and say that you are unmatched beneath the heavens. Say that I will never see such an amazing talent such as yourself in the next ten thousand years. \u201d said Lin Feng in a teasing tone.Lin Feng hadn\u2019t even fought against Lin Wu and had managed to make him crawl on the ground like a worm. Lin Hong who hadn\u2019t broken through to the Ling Qi layer yet and thought he could be that self confident.Obviously, Lin Hong was furious at those words.\u201cAlright, I understand. I will just have to kill you.\u201d Lin Hong said with an evil look. Behind him appeared an ice and snow spirit and a freezing cold Qi surrounded his body.\u201cLing Qi layer. Lin Hong had also broken through to the Ling Qi layer. He was also hiding it.\u201d Shouted members of the audience\u201cNo wonder that their father plays a dominant role in the Lin Clan. His son and daughter are both geniuses which are only seen every thousand years. They have both broken through to the Ling Qi layer. This is incredible for our clan\u2019s future prospects. I think the clan definitely needs to change its Head of Clan now.\u201d Many people were getting very agitated thinking that Lin Ba Dao should become the Head of the Clan. They thought it would mean the rise of the clan into new heights of fame and glory. They thought the clan would become the strongest in Yangzhou City under the control of Lin Ba Dao.\u201cFor this year\u2019s annual meeting, I will end up on the battle stage with my sister. You are just a pitiful appetizer before the real fight. You will be crippled with a single strike, your father will step down as Clan Head, he will need the spare time to care for his crippled son.\u201d Said Lin Hong revealing his true vile nature.An ice cold Qi had invaded the entire atmosphere. The Xue Ying Mountain Village only accepted cultivators who possessed an ice and snow spirit. Ice and snow skills, agility techniques, abilities were all extremely powerful. Lin Hong was studying all of these skills at the Xue Ying Mountain Village. His body was diffusing an extremely cold air and it was clear that he wasn\u2019t the least bit weak. He was as strong or maybe even stronger than Lin Qian.Very quickly, Lin Feng\u2019s body was covered with a white layer of frost and snow. They hadn\u2019t even properly started the battle but Lin Feng was already affected by his opponent.\u201cRoaring Thunder.\u201d Lin Feng took the initiative to strike the first blow. Thunderous roars filled the atmosphere which stupefied everyone. When they saw the sword which was emitted radiant rays of light, they could tell that Lin Feng was also hiding exceptional power. Nonetheless, everyone still only had eyes for Lin Qian, Lin Hen and Lin Hong because they had all broken through to the Ling Qi layer.Lin Feng\u2019s sword thrust towards Lin Hong.Lin Hong wasn\u2019t taking it seriously. He just sluggishly raised his palm and an ice-cold Qi emerged. Lin Feng\u2019s long sword was covered with frost and snow as it was deflected.\u201cRoaring Thunder.\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s movements were quick and agile. His sword, while shaking from the vibrations of the attack, also shook off the frost and snow that was covering it and once again thrust towards Lin Hong.\u201cHmph.\u201d Lin Hong was smiling coldly. Lin Hong\u2019s palm shot towards Lin Feng\u2019s sword. An extremely strong ice Qi arose which made the point of Lin Feng\u2019s sword vibrate. A strong energy was starting to fill the atmosphere.\u201cThe Ling Qi layer\u2026 Cultivators who have reached it are strong. Strong Qi, agile, physical strength\u2026 They\u2019re really much stronger than Cultivators of the Qi layer.\u201d Lin Feng sensed an extremely strong power going through his sword. He felt gloomy in his heart but his face never changed from his relaxed smile.\u201cNine Heavy Waves.\u201d Lin Feng pulled his sword back and instantly strong shock waves ran down his arm and shot out from his hand, aimed directly at Lin Hongs chest.\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Hong frowned. He would have never thought that Lin Feng was able to use two different skills using both his hands at the same time. That was an extremely difficult thing to achieve but the way Lin Feng did it was completely flawless.\u201cPiss off.\u201d Shouted Lin Hong. Even though he had broken through to the Ling Qi layer, he wasn\u2019t dominating the battle at all, against all of his expectations. Ice and snow started whirling together in the air as if they were dancing. The waves suddenly came to a halt and could not move forward.Lin Feng did not stop and repeatedly thrust his sword towards Lin Hong.Lin Feng\u2019s sword was whistling through the air and thunderous roars were still increasing within the atmosphere. Lin Feng was standing on his feet as firmly as a mountain without taking a step backwards. His sword looked like a ferocious dragon which called forth a violent thunderstorm.\u201cWow.\u201d Said Lin Hai in a low voice. This is Lin Feng\u2019s true power. Movement, skills, techniques were all far above expectations: quick, agile, skillful.Lin Hong was forced to move back with an ugly expression on his face. Even though he had only made a step back, he was a Cultivator of the Ling Qi layer and he was wildly arrogant and presumptuous. He even said that Lin Feng wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand a single blow. Yet each sword attack seemed quicker than the last and Lin Feng had forced him to step back. Obviously, his face was not as bright as when he believed he could defeat Lin Feng in a single strike. He was being humiliated by someone who has not reached Ling Qi Layer.He could no longer contain his fury at the humiliation he had suffered.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 - Lin Hai\u2019s FuryPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHere is Monday\u2019s regular release. To all those who complained about the cliffhangers from before, you have not seen anything yet.P.s does anyone know a good advertising network for this site? I obviously don\u2019t want adult advertisements or those annoying videos that burst through your speakers, making you wonder where the sound is coming from.Enjoy xoxo\u201cI am going to kill you!\u201d Lin Hong shouted. \u201cFrozen Shadows!\u201dThe atmosphere became deathly silent and as the temperature started to drop drastically, the ground was starting to freeze solid. An unusual snow started to fall from the sky, shadow snowflakes, they completely surrounded the arena and some even started to whirl around Lin Hong creating what looked like a shield of snow. The temperature continued to drop lower and lower until everything within sight had started to freeze over.\u201cIf you want to kill me, you first need to have the skills to do it.\u201d Said Lin Feng as snow continued to fall heavily onto him, his eyebrows were frosty which made them look white but his eyes were like black holes which consumed all life from the atmosphere around him. He stood in place unmoving and as calm as ever.He took a step forward and the whole stage began to shake, not only the stage but the earth beneath began to tremble violently. The energy contained within Lin Feng\u2019s Qi had not weakened within this world of snow, but it had also become much stronger than ever before.Increasing the energy within his Qi led to increased strength, Lin Feng was determined to finish Lin Hong off quickly by using all of his power. He started to absorb the force contained within the ice and snow then concentrated all of the force into his fist and the tip of his sword. He was not only using the force from the snow and ice within the area but was also borrowing force from heaven and earth. The force which he had absorbed to this point was on a terrifying level.Lin Feng concentrated force into his left fist while his right arm would thrust out and create earth-shattering thunderous roars in the direction of Lin Hong.The power of his Roaring Thunder was growing more and more terrifying with each thrust of his sword. His attacks had started to look like real lightning bolts bursting through the air. It seemed like the entire snow filled atmosphere was getting cut into pieces by the power of thunder and lightning.Lin Hong\u2019s pupils shrunk in shock. Lin Feng\u2019s sword was even more powerful now than just a moment before. The snow atmosphere created was intended to weaken his attack power, not increase it. Not only were his attacks growing stronger but they also emanated a strong force. It seemed like the force of all the elements were becoming sword force which consumed the snow, adding to its power.Lin Hong raised both his hands up in the air, Lin Hong wasn\u2019t underestimating Lin Feng\u2019s power any longer. He started using a strong Qi of ice and snow, which began to fill the air before disappearing into Lin Feng\u2019s sword. Lin Hong could not believe his eyes, his power was being absorbed and converted into the opponents attack power.\u201cAnything that stands in the way of a Sword Master will be annihilated! There is no power which can dominate the sword!\u201d Said Lin Feng. He made another step and his sword started radiating light. The power contained within the tip of this sword looked more powerful than anything within heaven and earth.Lin Feng began walking towards Lin Hong. With each step a thunderous roar filled the air as his sword thrust against the snow between him and Lin Hong.Lin Hong stepped back, and then stepped back again. He was unconsciously retreating as his body could sense the danger.Lin Hong looked like he had just seen a ghost. His face was incredibly pale.At that moment, the entire crowd was absolutely amazed at what they could see. Lin Feng was continuing to advance while Lin Hong retreated.\u201cHow is this even possible?\u201d\u201cHow could Lin Feng be so strong?\u201d\u201cLin Hong has broken through to the Ling Qi layer! Yet he continues to retreat from Lin Feng\u2019s sword.\u201dThe crowd did not know how to explain the fact that Lin Feng was so unbelievably strong. The difference between the Qi layer and the Ling Qi layer wasn\u2019t small, it was a huge gap which required a cultivator to be extremely talented to overcome the difference in power, and to do it at such a young age required a true genius. How could Lin Feng, the trash of the Lin Clan, have become a genius in such a short time?Lin Ba Dao was even more astonished. His face had become extremely twisted and ugly. His killing intent towards Lin Feng had grown even stronger.Lin Hai looked amazed, he had a big smile on his face and a proud look in his eyes. No wonder Lin Feng had so much confidence. He was so strong when using a sword, it seemed like Lin Feng had hidden his true strength his entire life.\u201cIt seems like Little Feng has never released his spirit. If his spirit awakens, what kind of spectacle would it be?\u201d thought Lin Hai. His thoughts were racing. He felt endlessly gratified. It seemed like he was witnessing the abrupt rise of his son. It seemed like his son wasn\u2019t a piece of trash actually, but rather a legend in the making.Lin Hai glanced at Lin Ba Dao in a teasing way.\u201cARGHHHH\u201d Lin Hong was going insane. He was shouting like a madman while trying to create another snow based barrier.\u201cWhy are you shouting?\u201d asked Lin Feng while smiling coldly. The Qi of the sword was rolling in the atmosphere creating strong gusts of wind which conquered anything that came into their path. Lin Hong had no chance to win any longer. Every attack he used would only strengthen the force contained within Lin Feng\u2019s sword.\u201cWhoosh\u201dLin Feng\u2019s sword made a whistling sound. The Qi of Lin Hong\u2019s snow shield was destroyed by Lin Feng\u2019s sword again. This time however, Lin Hong wasn\u2019t able to withstand the full attack. His clothes were ripping into pieces and blood was dripping down his body. The sword had not struck him but the Qi from the attack had caused him to end up in such a sorry state.Lin Hong could feel a chill running down his spine as his body grew cold. It was the first time that his own Qi had made him feel cold, so cold that it was chilling him to the bone. Even more shocking the Qi which injured him was his own. Not only was he injured but his life was now at stake. Lin Feng\u2019s sword had no mercy contained within. If there was a single opportunity, Lin Feng\u2026 would kill him.That\u2019s right, at that moment, Lin Hong became aware of how dangerous the situation had become for him. Until now, he had thought that he would be able to attack Lin Feng without retaliation, able to take Lin Feng\u2019s life but he had never thought that the situation would be the exact opposite.Lin Hong hated himself for not practicing his agility techniques. He could not see a way for him to retreat from this situation. All of Lin Feng\u2019s attacks were flawless. He was in complete fusion his sword Qi.\u201cBOOOM!\u201dA strong wind destroyed the snow filled atmosphere. Lin Feng had started to move and the atmosphere itself was twisting and exploding. It looked like the apocalypse and the only thing left standing within was a single sword.\u201cThis looks dangerous.\u201d Lin Ba Dao looked glum and shouted: \u201cYou animal, you are clearly stronger, don\u2019t you dare\u2026!\u201d\u201cShut up! Lin Ba Dao, have you forgotten that you are the one who suggested this situation? Now that Lin Hong is not able to defeat Lin Feng, you want to intervene?\u201d said Lin Hai preventing Lin Ba Dao from getting involved. He moved and seemed to disappear, he was instantly in front of Lin Ba Dao. He no longer had any mercy left for Lin Ba Dao, he had given up hope. Even if Lin Hai still had friendly feelings for Lin Ba Dao from the past, Lin Ba Dao bore a bitter hatred for him and his son. Considering Lin Ba Dao wanted to take Lin Feng\u2019s life, Lin Hai could only be just as ruthless.\u201cAAAHHHHH\u201dLin Hong gave a horrible shriek making Lin Ba Dao\u2019s face change drastically. \u201cOut of my way!\u201d He shouted as he tried to move past Lin Hai.\u201cDon\u2019t imagine you can act as you wish with such little power.\u201d Lin Hai released his spirit, it seemed like the universe had frozen and time had stopped. Lin Ba Dao had frozen over where he stood.\u201cI am not in the mood anymore, since you and your direct family constantly tries to take my life. You should just die here.\u201d Lin Feng was gazing at Lin Hong who was covering his wounds trying to prevent the blood from spilling onto the stage. Lin Feng looked completely heartless at this moment. He watched Lin Hong with a cold smile on his face.Lin Feng looked like he was deciding whether to chop him in half horizontally or vertically.\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d shouted a fragile voice. It was Lin Qian. Her Ice and fire spirit burst out of her body. Lin Feng had the sensation he was burning and freezing at the same time. Lin Qian was quickly approaching him.\u201cGet lost!\u201d Lin Feng turned around. He thrust out his sword and unleashed all of the contained force and an endless amount of Qi.\u201cBOOOM!!\u201dThe ice and fire filling the atmosphere dispersed in an instant.\u201cDie.\u201d shouted a cold voice from behind him, before Lin Feng could turn around a sword had already pierced his throat.An extremely strong power was unleashed within the atmosphere and Lin Feng was sent flying backwards. Blood began to spray endlessly from his throat as he flew through the air.\u201cYou have no integrity and no morals.\u201d Lin Hai shouted in a long and mournful cry. While Lin Hai was preventing Lin Ba Dao from getting involved, Lin Zhen rushed to the stage and used the opportunity to cut Lin Feng\u2019s jugular.\u201cIce Age!\u201d Lin Hai had gone into a rage. The entire atmosphere froze, Lin Zhen had a gloomy face as he sensed an incomparably strong ice Qi strike him in the face. Everyone in the crowd had been frozen into place.\u201cHelp me!\u201d shouted Lin ZhenIt was already too late. Lin Hai\u2019s palm was already in front of him and then smashed down into his chest. His pupils were wide open while staring at Lin Hai.\u201cYou\u2026 actually \u2026.dared to kill me\u2026\u201d Blood was uninterruptedly spilling out of Lin Zhen\u2019s mouth. Lin Hai didn\u2019t just attack Lin Zhen\u2019s chest but had sent his ice Qi into his body which had destroyed most of his organs. Lin Hai had already sealed Lin Zhen\u2019s fate.\u201d Lin Zhen, you attacked my son by surprise, I will never forgive you.\u201d Lin Hai\u2019s tone was extremely cold. Lin Hai\u2019s hand was shaking with anger. Lin Zhen\u2019s eyes were wide open and staring at Lin Hai with hatred and resentment as he slowly died.Everyone looked as rigid as statues. Had the Lin Zhen been killed so easily?At that moment, the entire crowd looked at Lin Hai. Their eyes were filled with fear. Only an extraordinary strength of this level could bring terror to the hearts of everyone present. Was there really such a monster within the Lin Clan?. At that moment, Lin Ba Dao didn\u2019t dare move a finger.Lin Hai turned around and looked at Lin Qian and said in a cold and detached tone: \u201cA genius of the Hao Yue Sect? A genius of the Snow Shadow Mountain Village? Both of you are shameless trash.\u201dLin Qian bit her lips. She could see Lin Hai\u2019s murderous intentions. She didn\u2019t dare say a word. He started walking, his eyes were filled with killing intent. Everyone feared that a single sound could cause the deaths of everyone present.He was moving towards Lin Qian because Lin Hong had lost the battle but Lin Zhen as well as Lin Qian had attacked Lin Feng by surprise. When they thought that Lin Hong would be able to defeat Lin Feng, they wanted to push the battles as far as possible without the possibility of surrender, hoping that Lin Feng would die. When they found out that nothing was happening the way they had expected, they wanted to get involved and attacked Lin Feng by surprise and cut his throat, how could Lin Hai not be furious?\u201cWhat do you intend to do?\u201d Lin Qian asked staring at Lin Hai.\u201cExterminate you all.\u201d Said Lin Hai with a clear voice. At that moment, nothing could calm his anger.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38 - The Honorable ElderPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySpecial Thanks to Carlton W for this chapter. This will be the first of 3 chapters released tonight.Also check out the new chat ???? Hope you all enjoy! xoxo\u201cWould you dare to kill me?\u201d Lin Qian asked whose face looked completely frozen.\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d replied Lin Hai grinning with the same killing intent filling his eyes.\u201cLin Hai, do you know what you are doing?\u201d shouted Lin Ba Dao and some other elders who were in panic.\u201cLin Hai, you bastard! Who do you think it is that you are threatening?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense to me. Today, I will kill anyone who gets in my way.\u201d Lin Hai said while his eyes looked over the crowd. His gaze pierced like daggers.Lin Hai looked at the elders miserable expressions, narrowed his eyes and suddenly a distant voice was heard.\u201cIs that so?\u201dSomewhere in the territory of the Lin Clan, a vast and powerful force with an incredible Qi burst out. Immediately after, the crowd noticed a human silhouette about a kilometer away. The figure flew at an incredible speed, moving over the crowd and landing on the fighting stage.It was an old man. His eyebrows were as black as ink, he looked extremely mysterious. His frame was sturdy and he was as tall as Lin Hai. He looked extremely similar to Lin Ba Dao.\u201cHonorable Elder.\u201d whispered Lin Hai and then immediately smiled but it looked like a sorrowful smile. It was his uncle: Lin Rui.Lin Rui is usually always practicing cultivation within the Lin Clan territory. Each time there was a problem, whether it was important or not, the Head of the Clan and the Elders dealt with them. Lin Rui would almost never break his training and come to meet with the clan.\u201cHonorable Elder.\u201d everybody was stupefied at the display of power he had just shown. Flying through the sky like he was walking in a quiet and peaceful courtyard, it required incredibly strong agility techniques and a high level of cultivation.Lin Feng was lying on the floor powerless as blood still poured from his throat, he quickly swallowed a few profound healing pills. His wound had begun to heal, but he had lost so much blood that he could only lay there while the pill healed him. While looking up at Lin Rui from the ground, he remembered that he had seen him only twice. The Honorable Elder almost never came out.\u201cHonorable Elder, Lin Hai, the Clan of the Head, attaches no importance to the Lin Clan. He groundlessly killed the Seventh Elder\u201d\u201cRight now, he also wants to kill an unprecedented genius of the Lin Clan, Lin Qian. He even threatened all of the elders and clan members present.\u201d\u201cHonorable Elder, please punish Lin Hai for all of his crimes.\u201d said the elders, as if Lin Hai was at the origin of all the problems within the clan.Lin Hai Could only laugh at his situation.\u201cLin Hai, what are you laughing at?\u201d asked Lin Rui in an apathetic tone.\u201cI\u2019m laughing because they are really shameless. Initially, wasn\u2019t the Honorable Elder supposed to support the clan from the background and not get involved with the clan, unless the clan was in danger?\u201d Said Lin Hai sarcastically.\u201cHow impudent and presumptuous. How dare you talk to me like this?\u201d Lin Rui said in an ice cold tone and anger filled his eyes.\u201cUncle, I am the Head of the Lin Clan. Even if you have the status of an Honorable Elder, it doesn\u2019t give you the right to concern yourself with how I handle the affairs of the clan. As clan head, my decision is the final decision on these matters\u201d said Lin Hai stubbornly. He was standing with his back straight and head held high while looking Lin Rui in the eyes.\u201cWhat nerves you have! The Honorable Elder is not just any elder, he is also an elder of your own bloodline. You have the audacity to make no distinction between juniors and seniors. That itself counts as a crime against the clan.\u201d Lin Ba Dao said in an attempt to incite unrest.\u201cA crime? I only said that I am the Head of the Clan and my decision on clan affairs are final, that\u2019s a fact.\u201d Lin Hai knew what the inevitable outcome of that situation was going to be. He turned around and went towards Lin Feng.A palm filled with ice suddenly shot towards Lin Hai.Lin Hai kept walking towards Lin Feng, ignoring the incoming attack. The palm of ice landed firmly on Lin Hai\u2019s defenseless back. It was an extremely powerful attack, Lin Hai\u2019s entire body was immediately covered with frost and a chill filled his body. He was completely white from head to foot and suddenly flew towards Lin Feng looking like a kite with a broken string.\u201cHuh?!\u201d shouted Lin Hai surprised. He was kneeling down on the ground. He had flown over to Lin Feng and been caught mid air. He was shocked that his son was not dead and seemed unharmed when he caught him. Nonetheless, his facial expression hadn\u2019t changed since the beginning.\u201cUncle, you attacked me from behind when I was defenseless. From now on, there is no bond that exists between me and this clan and from this day forward I am cutting my blood ties with you.\u201d Said Lin Hai with blood spilling out of his mouth. He had been attacked by surprise by Lin Rui. He could feel the cold piercing through to his bones and was slightly shivering from the cold. If Lin Feng hadn\u2019t caught him as he flew through the air, he would have landed much farther away.\u201cPfff, we are indeed blood related. You are my family, so I will not kill you. Just get lost.\u201d Lin Rui said coldly. He hadn\u2019t expected that Lin Hai wouldn\u2019t block the attack so he had attacked without hesitation. He had mixed feelings about what had just happened. Lin Qian was starting to be well known in the clan as a genius. She had a bright future before her and she would raise the clan to new levels of fame and status. If the clan rose in fame and status then Lin Rui could also gain benefits.\u201cThe skills and abilities of that piece of trash, Lin Feng, greatly improved but a useless spirit remains a useless spirit. Lin Feng will never be able to reach the same level as someone like Lin Qian.\u201d thought Lin Rui.\u201cLittle Feng, we\u2019re leaving.\u201d whispered Lin Hai to Lin Feng in a soft and fragile voice.Lin Feng nodded. He was still unable to speak. In his heart he could feel nothing but hatred and regret. He looked like a ghost, he had lost so much blood that it was shocking that he was still alive.Lin Feng was able to stand but he needed Lin Hai\u2019s support to walk. Lin Feng didn\u2019t even look back at the clan because their faces were already engraved deep into his heart.All the members of the Lin Clan looked at him and his father leave. Many members of the clan were confused in their hearts about what had just happened.Lin Feng was known as a piece of trash by everyone. Yet he had such a powerful force fused with his attacks, such a terrifying Qi, such skillful sword play, he had defeated a cultivator of the Ling Qi layer and he even made Lin Wu crawl on the ground like a worm\u2026 could a piece of trash accomplish such things?Lin Hai had killed the Lin Zhen in one strike and had threatened everyone present saying that he would kill them if they tried to get in his way, if the Honorable Elder hadn\u2019t appeared, who could have stopped him?Unfortunately, Lin Ba Dao had his talented daughter, Lin Qian. Otherwise, Lin Hai would have stayed the Head of the Lin Clan. Regarding Lin Feng and Lin Hai, the opinion of the Lin Clan\u2019s members had changed, they deserved respect and could be proud of their actions.\u201cWhat a pity, if we had only worked together then we could rejuvenate the clan and would have no more worries.\u201d thought the Sixth Elder while looking at the two silhouettes on the horizon. He then sighed in regret as he wasn\u2019t strong enough to change anything that had happened. He could only remain silent and accept the situation as it was.Lin Hai was meditating in his room. A white and foggy Qi was surrounding his body and started to penetrate into him, it was healing all of his wounds and removing the ice Qi which had penetrated into his body. Not long after, he opened his eyes and a dazzling light was surrounding his body.\u201cFather, how are you feeling?\u201d asked Lin Feng who was next to him.\u201cThe injuries are almost completely healed. Little Feng, these pills are amazing. Where did you get them?\u201d asked Lin Hai while grabbing the medicine bottle containing the profound healing pills. Immediately after taking a pill, his injuries suddenly looked much better. He had rapidly recovered from his wounds.\u201cIt seems that if I have the opportunity, I\u2019ll have to thank Protector Kong.\u201d Lin Feng had a big smile on his face. He wouldn\u2019t have thought that these pills would have such a powerful effect on his father. On that day when Han Man was injured, Lin Feng had already thought that these pills were mysterious, almost mystical. The Honorable Elder\u2019s attack on Lin Hai would have turned Han Man into meat paste. Lin Hai\u2019s injury was much more serious than that of Han Man. Only because Lin Hai was much stronger than Han Man, had he survived such an attack.However, as before, the profound healing pill was able to make Lin Hai recover in no time. This showed how powerful these pills were.\u201cFather, one of the protectors within the Yun Hai Sect gave them to me.\u201d replied Lin Feng.\u201cOh.\u201d Lin Hai nodded. \u201cLittle Feng, you should go back to the Yun Hai Sect. In a short time, you will probably surpass Lin Qian by leaps and bounds.\u201d\u201cSurpass Lin Qian?\u201d Lin Feng smiled in his heart. He had not even put Lin Qian\u2019s level in his eyes. The path of cultivation was vast, how could he pursue such an insignificant thing as trying to surpass Lin Qian?\u201cFather, what about you? Where will you go?\u201d Lin Feng held back his words on his current goal being much greater. He would rather find out if his father had planned to stay with him.\u201cI\u2019m getting ready to go to the Imperial City.\u201d\u201cThe Imperial City?!\u201d Lin Feng was stupefied. The Imperial City is without doubts the biggest, busiest, the most powerful and prosperous city in the Xue Yue Country. In the Imperial City, a small Clan like the Lin Clan could easily disappear without a trace\u2026 the Imperial Clan was unsurpassed and extremely powerful.Actually, it was also possible to regard the Imperial Clan as a sect, as the strongest Sect of the entire Xue Yue Country.\u201cDon\u2019t worry Little Feng. Even though the Imperial City is full of extraordinary Cultivators, I am not going there to cause trouble or kill people. I\u2019m just going there because I feel like visiting. There will not be any problems if I go there. Practice more and once you are stronger, come to the Imperial City to see me.\u201d said Lin Hai who saw that Lin Feng was frowning and worry could be seen on his face. Lin Feng immediately looked more relaxed which made Lin Hai smile.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s leave.\u201d Lin Hai said while standing up. He just picked up a few paintings and scrolls then they left together. They eventually arrived outside the city and came to a halt.They looked at the vast and boundless horizon stretching across the sky which seemed endless. Lin Hai spat towards the city, turned around and said to Lin Feng while smiling: \u201cLittle Feng, we are not taking the same road, you leave first, ok?\u201d\u201cFather, I want to stay here until you are leaving. You can leave first.\u201d said Lin Feng while shaking his head.Lin Hai looked at him a bit surprised, then smiled and said: \u201cAlright, Little Feng, people are dangerous and many have evil intentions, be careful on your journey.\u201dWhen he finished talking, Lin Hai jumped on a horse and quickly disappeared into the distance. His silhouette gradually disappeared. Lin Hai had seen Lin Feng display his power during the annual meeting and was therefore feeling more relaxed. He had the feeling that Lin Feng did not need his advice anymore, but he could not stop himself from worrying as his father.Lin Feng watched while his father\u2019s silhouette disappeared into the horizon. He raised his head, gazed into the sky and then immediately rode Qian Li Xue back into Yangzhou City.\u201cHow is it possible to leave things as they are? If I had defeated Lin Qian during the annual meeting, then they would never have treated my father in such a way. I will show the Lin Clan!\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I have translated it but it is completely un-edited and needs to be rewritten in parts.Enjoy xoxoThe rain was heavily flowing down. The sky was filled with rain clouds and the scent of rain filled the air.Pedestrians on the streets were running from place to place to try and find shelter from the storm.A young man with a stern look on his face was slowly riding a horse down the street, unbothered by the rain. He was wearing a black waterproof cape and was slowly heading towards the Whistle Wind Restaurant.\u201cTake good care of my horse.\u201d said the young man to one of the restaurant staff as he handed over the reins of his horse. He then calmly walked into the Whistle Wind Restaurant.Because of the rain, the Whistle Wind Restaurant was bustling with people and the sounds of laughter could be heard all around. The ground floor of the restaurant was so full that it was hard to move within the crowd. The restaurant was filled with all sorts of people who had come to watch and participate in the annual meetings. The sounds of drunken conversations could be heard all around, the atmosphere was dense with the discussion of rumors and events.\u201cHave you heard what happened? Yesterday, Lin Hai and his son, that piece of trash called Lin Feng, were expelled from the Lin Clan. The Lin Clan had finally decided to remove the trash from their doorstep.\u201d\u201cHaha, I think the news is already widely spread in the entire city of Yangzhou. No need for you to tell me. Lin Ba Dao is extremely strong, news has already spread about how he defeated Lin Hai and chased him from the clan. However, not only is he very strong but his son and daughter are greatly talented, they have both already broken through to the Ling Qi layer\u201d\u201c They can be proud of themselves to reach such a level at a young age. They are much stronger than that piece of trash will ever be. They say Lin Ba Dao defeated Lin Hai and kicked him from the clan after he ruthlessly attempted to interrupt the fight between Lin Feng and Lin Hong, Lin Feng would have been killed by Lin Hong if the fight continued. How shameless can a clan head be, to attack those of the younger generation without warning!\u201dThere were surprisingly a large amount of people commenting what had happened within the Lin Clan. Lin Feng had arrived on the first floor and was about to sit down when he heard the comments from the people discussing. He stood up and started heading back down to the ground floor of the restaurant.\u201cThese lies which are spread about the Lin Clan\u2026 Obviously, we left because we couldn\u2019t stand it anymore\u2026 are Lin Ba Dao and his family really such geniuses?\u2026\u201d Lin Feng thought sarcastically. Lin Ba Dao\u2019s audacity seemed to have no end, he had even said that he personally defeated Lin Hai. Lin Feng was keeping calm in the face of the unexpected rumors.\u201cDear guest, how may I help you?\u201d asked a server while greeting Lin Feng.\u201cI would like a bottle of wine and some pickles.\u201d Lin Feng said. In a flash, what he ordered was already on the table, the restaurant was very used to the busy atmosphere at this time of year.\u201cI heard that the Whistle Wind Restaurant is the place to come to hear the latest news. I wonder if someone could tell me about the annual meeting for Yangzhou City.\u201d thought Lin Feng while pouring some wine into his glass. He raised his glass and toasted that his father was finally free from the Lin Clan, he savored every drop. The alcohol gave him a warm sensation in his stomach, the wine tonight was quite strong. It was completely different from the alcohol Lin Feng had drunk before. He was used to receiving the finer wines on the top floor of the restaurant.At that moment, three people walked into the Whistle Wind Restaurant. There were two females and one male. Everybody in the restaurant had their eyes on the three people who had entered. The young man didn\u2019t need to speak, he just continued to fan himself with his feathered fan. They had just emerged from an extremely elegant carriage and all had a feather fan in hand. They all looked extremely confident and self assured. The two girls were both wearing green robes, one light green while the other had a tinge of blue within. Not only did they have a commanding presence but they were also extremely beautiful. The face looked delicate and their bodies were also extremely alluring.The crowd was paying attention to one of the girls in particular.Even though it was raining, that girl didn\u2019t have a single drop of water on her body. She was wearing a set of green robes with a hint of blue. She looked as serene and as a calm as the ocean, It looked like the color of her robes complimented each of her physical features. Every part of her body was fascinating to the eye. Her eyes were clear as water. She was extremely attractive, seduction seemed to be something engraved in her soul. The beautiful girl wearing light green robes standing next to her had lost all her splendor by standing next to such a beautiful girl.\u201cNa Lan Hai, you go upstairs first, I\u2019m staying here for a moment.\u201d said the other young girl. Her voice was pleasant to the ear.\u201cAlright.\u201d replied Na Lan Hai still holding her feather fan. Immediately after, she went to the first floor. Then, the young girl wearing the light green robes glanced at the room looking for a good place to sit.\u201cMiss, it looks like there are no seats.\u201d The young girl wearing light green robes looked around the room but didn\u2019t find a place to sit, the restaurant was crowded more than usual.\u201cMiss, wait for a moment please.\u201d the young girl wearing light green robes had noticed there was a young man sitting alone at his table. She started to move towards Lin Feng.Lin Feng raised his head, looked at the young girl wearing light green robes and asked: \u201cIs there something I can help with?\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d said the young girl while throwing one silver coin on Lin Feng\u2019s table and then said: \u201cI\u2019m giving you this silver coin in exchange for your table.\u201dLin Feng was stupefied and then slightly smiled. He also took out a silver coin and put it on the table as well.\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d asked the young girl while frowning.Lin Feng raised his head and gazed directly into the young girls eyes and said: \u201cI think you look unpleasant. Therefore, I am giving you this silver coin to go and find another table far out of my sight.\u201d\u201cYou Dare\u2026\u201d said the young girl while looking confused and angry. Right after, she said in a cold and detached tone: \u201cHow dare you, do you even know who I am?\u201dLin Feng remained silent and shook his head. He continued to pour wine in his glass and drank it.\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn who you are. Now run along\u201d said Lin Feng unexpectedly in a very cold tone.When the young girl heard Lin Fengwith his impolite speech and cold tone, she could not help but be angry, she suddenly released a strong Qi from her body. Lin Feng had a stunned expression on his face. The young girl was younger than him and she had already broken through to the eighth Qi layer. No wonder that she had such an arrogant attitude.\u201cWhat? Are you scared now?\u201d asked the young girl who had noticed Lin Feng\u2019s expression. She had a smile of victory on her face, like a child who had just won an arguement.Lin Feng was stupefied again at her reaction but remained silent. \u201dLu Er, please don\u2019t cause trouble.\u201d said a soft and gentle voice. It was the beautiful and fascinating girl wearing the green robes with a hint of blue. She was gazing at the young girl in light green robes with disapproving eyes.\u201cLu Er is always like this. Please don\u2019t blame her.\u201d said the beautiful girl to Lin Feng while smiling. Her words were like a pleasant spring breeze. Right after, she moved towards Lin Feng\u2019s table and sat down with him, she looked very at ease.Lin Feng frowned. He hadn\u2019t heard any of them apologize for their actions, almost as if they did not have to explain themselves to him. Besides, the girl in the green and blue hadn\u2019t even asked Lin Feng if he agreed before she sat down.\u201cDo I look like one of your servants? In this world there are masters and there are servants. Today, I am the master of this table and I did not give a servant like you permission to sit.\u201d said Lin Feng in a sarcastic tone.The beautiful girl was speechless, then she groaned in displeasure. Everywhere where she went, everybody obeyed and respected her. If she sat at the same table as someone else, that person should feel extremely honored. Most men had no chance to even meet her eyes let alone be seated at the same table as her. On that day, she hadn\u2019t thought she would come across someone like Lin Feng who would ridicule her.\u201cMiss, we should teach this ignorant person a lesson.\u201d said the young girl wearing light green robes, she had become even more angry at Lin Feng\u2019s words.\u201cForget it, Lu Er.\u201d said the beautiful girl while shaking her head. Then, she stood up and said: \u201cSince he doesn\u2019t welcome us, let\u2019s just find another table.\u201d \u201dIt\u2019s just that some people lack tact. Next time, we should pay more attention and avoid these people.\u201dWhile saying that, the beautiful girl had turned around and left.\u201cMiss Na Lan, that guy is unable to recognize you and how great you are. Your family is one of great power. Don\u2019t lower yourself to his level. I have a lot of respect for you. If you wish, you can sit here.\u201d said people in the crowd while inviting the girl to sit with them.The beautiful young girl, didn\u2019t refuse this time, she nodded and accepted which made the person inviting her overjoyed at his luck.\u201cThat guy is so lucky, why didn\u2019t I invite her first..?\u201d groaned people in the crowd watching the scene. They infinitely regretted they hadn\u2019t made the first move.\u201cWhat kind of guy is that? He really must not have eyes. Miss Na Lan wants to sit with him which is something that happens once in a lifetime\u2026 and he refuses. That was maybe the luckiest event of his life. He is a complete idiot.\u201dLin Feng could hear all sorts of comments all around him. Lin Feng shook his head. Servility, arrogance, power and all the things related\u2026 People clung to rich and power people. Lin Feng only believed in mutual respect. If someone respected Lin Feng, then he\u2019d respect them. The girl in green and blue robes and the girl in the light green robes hadn\u2019t respected Lin Feng from the beginning to the end, should he have acted in a servile way even though they hadn\u2019t showed him any respect? He would never lower himself to living on his knees.Lin Feng had heard from the surrounding conversations the status that the girl wearing green and blue robes held. She was the only daughter of the head of the City. The beautiful and talented Na Lan Feng.\u201cContrary to what one might expect, Na Lan Feng and Lin Qian actually are pretty similar. They consider everything and everyone as worms beneath them. They ignore everyone and just care about themselves. They are both very selfish individuals.\u201d Lin Feng thought while shaking his head. Concerning Na Lan Feng, there were many rumors about her in which she sounded to be wonderful and perfect but in reality she was the opposite.\u201cMiss Na Lan Feng, now that you arrived, why not come upstairs for a chat? We might even invite you to join us.\u201d said a cold voice coming from the higher levels of the restaurant. The entire crowd was stunned. Who was audacious enough to talk to her like that? Who dared to be so rude?\u201cHaha, I made the young miss of the Lin Clan wait for a long time, well then, Na Lan will come and join you.\u201d said Na Lan Feng while laughing. She immediately went upstairs.\u201d young miss of the Lin Clan?\u201d\u201cThat was Lin Qian of the Lin Clan. No wonder she dared talk to Na Lan Feng that way.\u201d\u201cI heard that Lin Qian has completely transformed. There is no comparison possible between past and present. She has an amazing talent and she has an excellent reputation within the Hao Yue Sect.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, it must be Lin Qian. I would have never thought that the city of Yangzhou could have two amazingly beautiful young girls with such talent.\u201dThe voice heard a moment ago was indeed Lin Qian\u2019s voice. She had the same arrogant voice as before. Lin Feng had immediately recognized it.Lin Feng learnt many things while listening to what people were saying in the restaurant. He also heard news of what was happening in the city. On that day, one of the most amazing junior cultivators in the restaurant was Na Lan Feng but that wasn\u2019t all. Lin Qian had also come as well as other younger disciples of the Gu Clan, of the Wen Clan\u2026 They were all sitting upstairs, completely unaware that Lin Feng was sat beneath them.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This is the best I could do to not leave on a cliffhanger.Special Thanks to Matazone and Anonymous for sponsoring this chapter. Much love xoxoEnjoy. xoLin Feng stood up and moved towards a dining table surrounded by the group talking. Their expression immediately changed when they saw him approach. After all, Lin Feng hadn\u2019t behaved in a friendly manner towards the girls who tried to join him. He had offended Na Lan Feng who was idolized by everyone.\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d asked one of the guests in an unfriendly tone way while staring daggers at Lin Feng.Lin Feng took out two silver coins and threw them on the table. He smiled and said: \u201cMay I take a seat with you?\u201d\u201cYou can. Of course, you can.\u201d The expression of the people on the table immediately changed. They had quickly become friendly and cheerful to have Lin Feng join them. In the Nine Clouds Continent the currencies consisted of precious stones alongside gold, silver and bronze coins. Extremely rich families had precious stones but they still needed silver and gold coins for daily expenses. Considering that a cultivator had lots of expenses, nobody would refuse silver or gold coins that were easily available. They quickly made room and prepared a chair for Lin Feng to sit and asked him: \u201cBrother, what do you need help with?\u201d\u201cEh, it may sound a bit weird, Na Lan Feng and some other outstanding cultivators have gathered together, what are they doing exactly?\u201d asked Lin Feng.\u201cBrother, this is something everybody knows. The senior cultivators of the City are preparing for the annual meeting in Yangzhou City. Na Lan Feng invited a few people to come so that she could pass on some information to the most outstanding young clan members and explain what her clan wishes to gain from the tournament. Of course, Na Lan Feng has other things in mind\u2026\u201dThat person stopped talking in order to keep Lin Feng in suspense: \u201cAs everybody knows, every year, the clan in control of Yangzhou City organizes a tournament to which a myriad of young cultivators participate and engage in battles. This year is no exception. Na Lan Feng is a representative figure in the clan of the city master. She invited all these outstanding disciples to explain them a few things but also\u2026 to get information on her enemies.\u201d Lin Feng laughed at the information. The Yangzhou City tournament was obviously no secret. He had come back to Yangzhou City precisely because the tournament was about to take place. This is why he hadn\u2019t returned to the Yun Hai Sect and decided to stay longer in Yangzhou City.\u201cI heard that the meeting was going to be different from the past ones. I heard that they were going to invite outstanding disciples from clans which are not established in Yangzhou City. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or if it is just a rumor?\u201d Lin Feng continued to ask.\u201cThat\u2019s right. There is indeed such a thing. Qiu Lan is very famous in Yangzhou City. The master of the City wanted her to gather all these people for that reason. All of the outstanding disciples who want to join the Yangzhou City tournament will need to meet with Qiu Lan.\u201d\u201cI understand. Thank you so much for all of the information. It has helped me greatly.\u201d said Lin Feng politely. He had already learnt everything he wanted to know. Lin Feng hurried to finish his alcohol and his pickles. The atmosphere of the restaurant had become too noisy for him and was giving him a headache.\u201cNa Lan Feng, is that the boy over there, who surprisingly dared to talk to you in a disrespectful way, we should go and cripple him.\u201d said a voice in an evil tone which suddenly made everyone in the restaurant go silent. Right after that, everybody saw people standing on the stairs leading to the first floor. Two silhouettes were slowly moving down. It was the girl wearing light green robes who had just accompanied Na Lan Feng as well as Na Lan Hai who had just went upstairs.\u201cThat young boy is out of luck.\u201d The crowd couldn\u2019t help but look at Lin Feng. They all felt sorry for the fate which was about to befall Lin Feng.\u201cThat guy acted too recklessly. He caused unwanted trouble. I hope he can fix his mistakes. You must be careful who you offend as the world is vast and there are many hidden dragons that you cannot offend.\u201dEverybody in the restaurant was whispering while looking at Lin Feng. These were going to be his last moments for having offended Na Lan Feng. Asking for forgiveness wouldn\u2019t give him any mercy.However, Lin Feng hadn\u2019t noticed everybody\u2019s reaction. He had a headache and was too tired to think. He had drunk alcohol and couldn\u2019t see other people\u2019s faces clearly, he was actually quite drunk.\u201cArgh, he should die for his insults.\u201d Na Lan Hai was grinning and his expression looked ice cold. He was slowly walking towards Lin Feng.\u201cYou have too much self confidence, daring to act so indifferently.\u201d said Na Lan Hai who had arrived next to Lin Feng while looking down at him. \u201cYou offended Na Lan Feng, the princess, prepare to bear the consequences.\u201d\u201cWhy are you wasting time with words? Just cripple his cultivation, immediately.\u201d said the young girl in light green robes impatiently.\u201cHehe, alright.\u201d replied Na Lan Hai moving his fan. That fan made him look smart and elegant but it was also as sharp as a blade.Lin Feng finally sobered up slightly on seeing this. He evilly glanced at Na Lan Hai. His cold expression made Na Lan Hai shiver. It was Lin Feng, indeed, it was him.The force abruptly vanished. Na Lan Hai hadn\u2019t expected that the one who had offended Na Lan Feng would be the person at the focus of all the rumors: Lin Feng.Na Lan Hai obviously knew all these rumors were not true. Not so long before, he had witnessed Lin Feng\u2019s strength with his own eyes in the Whistle Wind Restaurant. Not only was he strong but he was also ruthless and showed no mercy to those who offended him, not caring about their background. Maybe strong and ruthless were not the right words, it was more like he was actually a monster in human form, he wasn\u2019t strong or ruthless, it was just his nature to overpower and kill weaker animals.Na Lan Hai had also heard that Lin Feng\u2019s father had been expelled from the Lin Clan. However, he hadn\u2019t heard that it was because Lin Ba Dao was extremely strong but because it had required the Honorable Elder to stop him from exterminating the clan. He had also heard that Lin Feng made a shocking display of power and it had required an elder and two disciples of the Ling Qi Layer to stop him.\u201cGet lost.\u201d said Lin Feng in an ice cold tone which sent shivers down Na Lan Hai\u2019s spine. Lin Feng was exactly as he had imagined, he was terrifying. Lin Feng\u2019s words cut him like a knife and the thought of angering Lin Feng had made Na Lan Hai take a step back.\u201cNa Lan Hai, Are you not attacking yet?\u201d said the young girl wearing light green robes seeing that Na Lan Hai hadn\u2019t crippled Lin Feng\u2019s cultivation yet and had instead stepped back. She couldn\u2019t help but be furious at the events. Not only did it seem that Na Lan Hai hadn\u2019t heard what she was saying but he had also turned around and said: \u201cLet\u2019s leave, quickly!\u201d While saying these words, he immediately started to leave.\u201cIs it Na Lan Feng who asked you to come?\u201d asked Lin Feng in a cold and detached tone which made Na Lan Hai slow down in his retreat. He didn\u2019t reply. He continued to walk and pulled the young girl wearing light green robes as a sign that he wanted her to leave as well. Lin Feng smiled inside. It was very clear to Lin Feng at that moment what had happened. Those people who thought so highly of themselves, once finding out his identity, they didn\u2019t dare attack. Even if they still looked dominant, were they still talking with the same arrogant tone as before? Lin Feng hurried to drain his cup in one gulp and stood up. He then put on his black rain cape and a straw hat then immediately left. The entire crowd had only looked at his figure as he confidently walked out unharmed.The crowd in the Whistle Wind Restaurant looked at that strange young man. They had so many questions they wanted to ask him.\u201cWho is that young man who made the arrogant Na Lan Hai retreat and look scared?\u201d asked people in the crowd. They had thought Lin Feng would die. They hadn\u2019t expected that his opponent would cower upon the sight of him. Na Lan Hai\u2019s expression when looking at Lin Feng had obviously been one of complete terror. His actions showed that he did not dare provoke that young boy.\u201cNa Lan Hai, what was that?\u201d asked the girl in light green robes while furiously shaking Na Lan Hai\u2019s hand off of her.\u201cThat was Lin Feng.\u201d replied Na Lan Hai.\u201cThe piece of trash of the Lin Clan?\u201d\u201cLu Er, what piece of trash of the Lin Clan? Do you believe all these lies? Do you really believe he was expelled from the Lin Clan for being weak? According to what we know from our clan reports, Lin Feng made Lin Wu crawl down on the ground like a worm. He had almost killed Lin Hong, who has broken through to the Ling Qi layer. Lin Qian interrupted the fight and with both their powers they could not stop Lin Feng\u2019s attack. If it wasn\u2019t for an Elder who interrupted the fight, Lin Hong would have already taken his last breath.\u201d\u201cWhat? Are you saying that he was able to defeat Lin Hong who has broken through to the Ling Qi layer? How is that even possible? You must be mistaken\u201d said the young girl.\u201cEverything I\u2019m telling you is absolutely true. If you don\u2019t believe me, wait a moment, we can ask the young Miss.\u201d said Na Lan Hai with a wry smile on his face. Before seeing Lin Feng at the Whistle Wind restaurant the last time, he would have also thought that those were all fake rumors about Lin Feng, that he was only a piece of trash, the disgrace and shame of the Lin Clan. He would have thought the rumors were spread by the other clans to cause the Lin Clan to lose face. However, he had eventually found out that those rumors were voluntarily spread by some Lin Clan members who had witnessed the events. It was clear that Lin Ba Dao had spread counter rumors to achieve his own goals. Lin Hai had also been wrong about his son. He did not know that Lin Feng wasn\u2019t the same weak willed and cowardly person that he was before. Lin Feng walked out of the Whistle Wind Restaurant and jumped onto Qian Li Xue, He didn\u2019t travel very far from the restaurant. He went to an inn which was near the Whistle Wind Restaurant. He went to an inn because he couldn\u2019t go back to the Lin Clan and had nowhere else he could stay. There was no other place to stay in Yangzhou City other than an inn.He immediately selected one of the best rooms: spacious and quiet. So that nobody would disturb him. He sat down and immediately started to meditate. He could feel a hunger within his body after suffering that near fatal wound. It was as if his body was yearning for more power and the strength to rule over all. He only needed more power and then no one could treat him the way they had treated him and his father. With their own strength, Lin Feng and Lin Hai would make their own reputation and crush those who had belittled them in the past.One day, Lin Feng would make the Lin Clan members regret the treatment they had given him and his father at the annual meeting. Lin Feng would make the Lin Clan regret from the bottom of their hearts, he would make them wish they could change their actions. With his own strength he would have his revenge and that day, was not that far in the future.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 - AssassinsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHere is Wednesdays Regular Chapter \u2013 Seems I may have drifted into the land of nod. Turns out I am really tired hehe late nights translating for you guys!!Enjoy xoxoxIn the room, Lin Feng was sitting on his bed while meditating peacefully. Lin Feng had released his dark spirit and was focused on absorbing the Qi which he gathered around himself. His sense of hearing when in this state was far above ordinary cultivators. If he wanted to then he could even hear what was being said back in the restaurant. This was because of his concentration and his dark spirit which was amplifying all of his senses. The Qi of heaven and earth was uninterruptedly penetrating into Lin Feng\u2019s body. A faintly discernible white light had appeared. The Qi felt like a strong wind which could turn into a typhoon at any point. It was his Qi which was growing strong to the peak of the Ninth Qi Layer.He was waiting to overcome the bottleneck and have a surge of power once again rush into him, and then Lin Feng could break through to the Ling Qi layer. He would be able to kill those who opposed him much easier than before, with his skills and technique, he could even kill a ninth Qi layer disciple without them even noticing anything. At that moment, some shadows outside were approaching the inn, it was clear that they were headed directly towards the inn. The group immediately entered into the inn unnoticed, using an incredible agility technique, which made them look like ghosts walking through the crowd. They were all carrying a bow which was made from ox horns. The strength of these bows was extraordinary. Cultivators of the Qi layer would gain a huge amount of power from using these ox horn bows.\u201cHe\u2019s in room number 2. It\u2019s best not to disturb him. That would be too troublesome. Let\u2019s handle this as quietly as possible\u201d Said one of the shadows who was standing outside of the group. The shadow was holding a feathered fan in their hand. They all quickly moved towards room number 2. No one within the inn had even noticed their presence.A short instant after, about ten shadows had appeared in front of the door to room number 2. They were extremely agile and graceful, almost no sound could be heard from their movements. Almost nobody could hear them, the only person who was aware of them was Lin Feng who had noticed them before they had even arrived at the inn. The strength of the shadows varied from person to person and it was impossible to tell their strengths from a glance.\u201cshish shish shish.\u201d The shadows had grabbed their bows off of their backs, they then with as little sound s possible knocked an arrow into the bow and drew the bowstring back.\u201cFIRE!!\u201d\u201cPssshhh, Psssshhh, Pssshhh.\u201d The sounds of the arrows piercing through wood filled the air within the inn, causing many people to suddenly notice the sound. These arrows were so powerful that they broke the wooden door open completely and within the room a there was a \u2018thump\u2019 followed by a rolling noise.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d shouted one of them taking the lead to charge into the room and check the results of what had just happened.When they entered the room however, there was not a soul in sight. The wooden bed of extremely high quality had been damaged by the arrows. In the bed was a human shaped figure which was made from various materials, but there was nobody there. Two of the shadows took the initiative to move farther into the room while remaining vigilant at all times. Suddenly, a whistling sound of a sword cutting through the air could be heard followed by a terrifying thunderous roar. All that could be seen within the darkness was a set of ruthless and bloodthirsty eyes staring towards the shadows. Cold silver light flashed through the air, it was a sword. Thunderous roars echoed within the air. Two horrifying screams could be heard from inside the room. The two shadows which had initially moved deeper into the room had come back into vision. This time they were corpses rolling along the ground, back towards the group.At the moment when these people entered into the inn, Lin Feng already knew that they were here. He originally paid them little attention and could not care for what their business was. He was in a trance like state in the middle of his practice. When he heard them arrive in front of his room, he had quickly regained his senses and understood the situation. It seemed like they were coming to kill him. Lin Feng had been hiding inside the room, away from the door as to not be hit by arrows. He had been leaning against the wall. He had chosen the wall which was a dead angle, so there was no chance of using a bow to strike him there. It was also impossible for the others to see him from outside. That was also very convenient as he could ambush the enemy from within the darkness. When Lin Feng had seen the power and strength of the arrow which had penetrated into the room, Lin Feng had considered himself very lucky to have noticed them first. If Lin Feng hadn\u2019t hidden within that dead angle, he would have been immediately shot dead by the arrows.But while considering his good luck, Lin Feng\u2019s heart was also filled with killing intent. His body was overflowing with a murderous aura which made him seem like an ancient mythical beast. That\u2019s why he had immediately killed two people, he could not suppress the urge to kill. It was almost as if there was a demon waiting in the shadows.\u201cCome, my sword has not tasted enough blood yet!\u201d said a bloodthirsty voice from within the darkness.Lin Feng gripped his sword tightly again and suddenly his figure had completely vanished. Two screams were heard from outside the room. Lin Feng had used his Moonlight Feather Agility to move outside and kill two of the assassins who felt safe outside. As the other assassins outside of the room looked at what had just happened with horrified expressions, Lin Feng used the opportunity to jump out of the window.\u201cChase after him.\u201d Shouted one of the assassins taking the lead while clearly angry at the situation.Like wild beasts they jumped out of the window, each having a bloodthirsty look on their face. It was a rainy night and it was unnaturally dark as the clouds blocked even the moonlight. If cultivators didn\u2019t have such amazing sight, they would hardly be able to see the road, especially when running at full speed. However, it didn\u2019t influence Lin Feng at all. Thanks to his dark spirit, he had amazing senses which were above others at his level. His five senses were extremely sharp and acute. He was able to see the road as clearly as he did during the day. The people following him were growing closer and closer with each second. The noise of their feet stamping on the wet ground had filled the air. The group was extremely large for just one person.\u201cWhoosh\u201dThe arrow flew past Lin Feng with a buzzing sound. Not far from his ear, the air itself was torn apart by the force created from the arrow. \u201dThe one who just shot that arrow has reached the ninth Qi layer. His power is comparable to that of Liu Fei. They are all far from being weak.\u201d Lin Feng thought while a shiver ran down his spine. Liu Fei was at the ninth Qi layer and she was extremely strong. Besides, she also had an extremely strong arrow spirit. Mentioning how strong her arrows were was pointless, it was obvious to anyone who had experienced them. On top of that, those following Lin Feng had a power comparable to that of Liu Fei. They were powerful and very well trained.Lin Feng would have never thought that some people would come to kill him in the middle of the night, why would they want to take his life?\u201cwhoosh, whoosh\u201dAnother two arrows flew past his head. He was less and less convinced that he would be able to keep avoiding the arrows if this continued. Not only were these people extremely strong but it also seemed that they had received intensive archery training. Their shooting accuracy was extremely high. If there was one flaw in his footwork, if he gave them one opportunity, a single arrow could kill Lin Feng.\u201cIt won\u2019t work this way. If I continue like this, I\u2019ll end up exhausted without any strength left and they will be able to finish me easily.\u201d thought Lin Feng while avoiding another arrow. He was feeling hopeless. Actually, all these people seemed to be at the ninth Qi layer. Besides, they could use their bows to the point of perfection and they were working with each other in perfect harmony. It even seemed like they were moving in formation. Even if Lin Feng is better at using agility techniques than them, it seems impossible for him to break away from that group of assassins. Lin Feng\u2019s feet were splashing in the wet mud and his robes had become covered in a layer of mud. It was still raining heavily like before. Lin Feng\u2019s robes were completely soaked. Lin Feng dodged quickly to the side to avoid another arrow. He then suddenly stopped and then turned around in the blink of an eye. Revealing his messy appearance.\u201cMoonlight Feather Agility.\u201d\u201cDie.\u201d In a flash, not only did Lin Feng stop running away, but he also used his agility technique to go back in the direction of his pursuers. Lin Feng skillfully wielded his sword which flashed in the darkness, roaring thunder could be heard vibrating through the atmosphere and merging with the heavy rain in perfect harmony. Blood had started to flow onto the ground, the rainwater on the ground was turning red with blood . The shadows that were running towards Lin Feng had been sliced through without consideration. Five of the assassins had been beheaded by Lin Feng in one smooth strike. The remaining assassins quickly retreated 10 meters. Their careful eyes were staring at Lin Feng. They were still very vigilant. They were all young and since the beginning of the battle, Lin Feng had already killed a large number of them.Lin Feng watched the group\u2019s movements through the raindrops. One of those people was wearing a black rain cape and was holding a folding fan in his hand. \u201dNa\u2026 Lan\u2026 Hai\u2026\u201d Lin Feng looked at him with and ice cold glare. That folding fan, that was a fan he remembered, Na Lan Hai\u2019s fan.He glanced at all of them, smiled coldly and said: \u201cSo many outstanding practitioners, only a few clans have such outstanding people in Yangzhou City but considering how many have come for me, is there really anyone outstanding within such a clan?\u201dNa Lan Hai, was calmly standing in the middle of the group when he heard these words, he couldn\u2019t help but roar furiously:\u201cThey all say that Lin Hai\u2019s son of the Lin Clan is a piece of trash. The Lin Feng that I know is not a piece of trash, he is a real genius, able to adapt to all sorts of situations, he is also very smart and resourceful\u2026 Too bad that\u2026\u201d\u201cToo bad that\u2026. What?\u201d Said Lin Feng\u201cToo bad that you are a true genius, but nobody will ever know.\u201d Na Lan Hai said with an evil grin: \u201cEven if you\u2019re a genius, it will be of no use once you\u2019re dead. With your death the smudge on Na Lan Feng\u2019s reputation will be gone.\u201d\u201cSo Na Lan Feng hates me because of a minor incident, because I pointed out her mistakes? So she has sent the mighty troops of Yangzhou City to chase and kill me in secret?\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s tone of voice was clearly mocking them. These people were all well trained. They were not ordinary cultivators. When Lin Feng looked at them carefully again, he clearly understood that they were the troops of Yangzhou City.There was one thing that Lin Feng didn\u2019t understand though. Na Lan Feng had been the first one to disrespect and disregard Lin Feng, that is why he had made her lose face. However was that insult worth her mobilizing the city troops to kill him? It seemed like Lin Feng hadn\u2019t anticipated that Na Lan Feng would use her status and power to have him disposed of in secret.\u201cDo you know how honorable and respectable Princess Na Lan is? She holds an extremely high status. Do you think that you have the right to humiliate her? Even if you die, it will not be enough of a punishment for having disrespected Princess Na Lan.\u201d Na Lan Hai said in a loud voice with an indifferent tone, as if everything he had said was perfectly logical.\u201cPrincess Na Lan? Honorable and respectable?\u201d Lin Feng grinned. Even if she was the Yangzhou City head\u2019s daughter, it also didn\u2019t give her the right to be that arrogant and conceited. Lin Feng wouldn\u2019t have thought that Na Lan Feng would stoop so low as to use her father\u2019s power to settle a small and petty grudge. She saw Lin Feng as nothing but an ant, her personality was just as rotten as Lin Qian.\u201cYou want to kill me? Shall we get started \u2026\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s dark spirit appeared behind his back. In the middle of that spirit, the spirit had no Qi and made no sound, many had not even noticed that he had released his spirit. Lin Feng had to pay attention to each and every attack as each one would be lethal, a small mistake would cost him his life. Lin Feng\u2019s dark spirit seemed to look around as if it had its own set of eyes. Lin Feng could sense everything that was surrounding him, including the ground beneath his feet. Nothing could escape from Lin Feng\u2019s senses at that moment, he could sense even the slightest of movements within the air.\u201cWhoosh\u201dAn arrow flew past Lin Feng\u2019s ear, so close it had almost hit. Lin Feng wasn\u2019t really surprised and had dodged it with ease which made the one who shot the arrow look slightly shocked. In the darkness of the night, his eyes were calm and murderous, he looked like a fierce beast gazing at its prey.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 - Darkness of the NightPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 42: Darkness of the NightLin Feng had released his dark spirit and he was not aware of how sinister he looked at that moment. He was calm and calculating, staring with eyes filled with no emotion. The practitioner who fired the arrow was stunned at such a terrifying gaze. Lin Feng seemed calm and at the same time murderous, under such a situation how was it possible to be so calm?Lin Feng took a step forward and used Moonlight Feather Agility. Lin Feng was instantly in front of a group of people, making them unable to use their bows at such a close distance.The long sword as it sliced through the air made a terrible wailing noise. Lin Feng was thrusting his sword towards them and each strike was more precise than the last. With every movement he was dodging an attack and blocking another with his sword. Everyone was furious. He was not only dodging their attack calmly, but he had also killed so many of them already\u2026 now they could not use their bows, they were slowly being pushed back.\u201cRelease your spirits and kill him.\u201d shouted Na Lan Hai furiously but he could not help but subconsciously retreat. As Lin Feng had arrived right in front of them, he was the most terrified of all, when he looked into Lin Feng\u2019s eyes he could see overwhelming murderous intent, but even more terrifying was how calm and composed he was. Na Lan Hai\u2019s heart was pounding, his entire body was shaking with fear. When everyone heard Na Lan Hai, they all moved forwards and released their spirits. The night was exceptionally dark tonight but releasing that many spirits immediately lit the area with prismatic light.An assassin with a vine spirit had managed to sneak behind Lin Feng. That spirit gave its cultivator a body that was flexible and strong. When the strength of its cultivator had become high enough, he could use his vine spirit to constrict enemies. The cultivators body would become like a vine, it would be almost boneless and was able to change forms.He was surrounded by vines that were spreading and extending throughout the atmosphere. It didn\u2019t seem to follow a precise trajectory, but was wild and untamed. When the cultivator saw that his hand was almost upon Lin Feng, a hideous grin appeared on his face. Immediately after, when the assassin seemed to be so proud of himself, a silver light appeared in the air and pierced him in the eye and through the back of his skull. His body was supported by the sword which simply tilted downwards and the assassins head slid down the sword, until it was completely removed.The sword strike was so precise, so quick and so flawless that it was scary. There was not a single ounce of wasted energy or unnecessary movement. He had killed that cultivator in a single strike, in such a terrifying way. The scariest part was that Lin Feng still remained calm as he watched the impaled head slide off his sword.Lin Feng didn\u2019t stop and instead used this to his advantage to attack. Lin Feng\u2019s sword was streaking across the night sky like a meteor. Another stream of blood splashed in the air, another person fell down dead. As the moonlight pierced the clouds and the dark night was illuminated, it seemed like a world of blood.These cultivators were all at the eighth and ninth Qi layers. Each time Lin Feng attacked, it was almost impossible for them to dodge a single strike ad Lin Feng\u2019s speed and accuracy were beyond perfect. They could do nothing to resist such a monster.\u201cWHOOOM.\u201d a heavy meteor like object was crashing through the air towards Lin Feng\u2019s head. If he allowed himself to be hit, he might not die, but he would be unable to win this fight and would be killed because of that. His life was balancing on a thin line.\u201cYou think I will let you dodge?\u201d At the moment when Lin Feng was attempting to dodge, a spear was piercing through the air and blocking his escape, the spear was amazingly powerful. He was being attacked from the front and the rear simultaneously. This was a strategy developed through battle and targeting Lin Feng\u2019s certain death.\u201cDie.\u201dLin Feng shouted loudly, then he threw his long sword with incredible speed, the sword pierced through the air and finally plummeted deep into the spear weilding opponent\u2019s chest. The assassin stood there with disbelieving eyes as he looked down to see the sword piercing through his chest. He felt like it must be a nightmare, this could not possibly be reality. He had never thought that Lin Feng would dare to dispose of weapon and use it to kill one of the attackers. Lin Feng was at the ninth Qi layer and was much stronger than each of them. However, he was clearly outnumbered by a great deal. Only one of them needed to reach Lin Feng and he would be severely injured. These injuries could even cost Lin Feng\u2019s life. Lin Feng should be vigilant and very defensive, however he had just risked his life on that last gamble. Lin Feng had thrown away his sword for the sake of killing another one of the group. It was terrifying to witness such disregard for his own life, with such a calm and calculating face.The one with the sword deep in his chest was just staring at Lin Feng. These were his last moments and he wanted to watch how Lin Feng was going to die as the meteor crashed into his head.\u201cSwish\u201d Silence filled the atmosphere. Lin Feng was holding a luminous sword. The meteor still hadn\u2019t reached its destination. Instead the cultivator with the meteor spirit, his head had been sent flying in the air, completely removed from his body. Lin Feng was using his soft sword and at this moment he was drenched in blood. \u201cThis is my fate.\u201d his opponent closed his eyes and his body collapsed onto the ground with a loud crash. The head of the one who had been beheaded a moment before fell down from the air onto the ground. Everyone looked on, frozen as if time had just stopped. They were asking themselves who could have survived that last sword strike.Sword Unsheathing. At the moment when the sword was unsheathed, the opponents head was sent flying. How could Cultivators of the ninth Qi layer compete with a strength and power such as that produced by the Sword Unsheathing skill?The opponents had forgotten to attack but Lin Feng didn\u2019t forget. Flashes of light one after the other appeared as Lin Feng slashed through the air. Each light was accompanied by a stream of blood. The current scenery was a landscape of blood. Each strike with his sword reached its target, not a single movement was wasted. Each strike was precise and deadly. At that moment, Lin Feng had forgot the meaning of mercy. Apart from being calm, as he bathed in this world of blood and took life after life, he could only feel indifferent. Na Lan Hai looked at each corpse as it fell to the ground, body after body was falling to the ground in a rain of blood. He was shaking and his mind had wanted to run but his legs were too weak. Each body represented a cultivator above the eight Qi Layer and there was now dozens of those bodies scattered on the ground. They represented the strong potential in Yangzhou City and particularly in the clan which controlled the city. At that moment, they were all lying dead on the ground and had fallen as easily as straw. They had all been killed one after the other by Lin Feng. All these people were supporters of Na Lan Hai and had contributed to his success. Lin Feng had killed so much talent belonging to his clan, it was a devastating blow.What was it that made Lin Feng\u2019s sword so deadly? What was it in Lin Feng\u2019s eyes that scared Na Lan Hai so much? Was it because he looked so calm? It looked like Lin Feng was used to slaughtering people as if they were cattle. The whistling sound of his sword cutting through the air was getting more and more intense to the point that with each whistle it seemed like the rain had stopped making sounds. The entire atmosphere was filled with the sword Qi and there was no room for anything else. The extremely strong Qi was also getting more and more powerful with each strike.\u201cRUN!!\u201d Na Lan Hai who was scared beyond belief had somehow come back into reality. Na Lan Hai had only one thought: get him and his clan as far away from that demon as possible. Without the least bit of hesitation, Na Lan Hai turned around and started running. \u201cYou want to leave now\u2026? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a bit too late?\u201d said a cold voice that seemed like the darkness itself speaking. The sound of the sword attacking suddenly stopped. Only the sound of Lin Feng\u2019s steps on the wet ground could still be heard.\u201cSplash\u201d\u201cSplash\u201d\u201cSplash\u201dNa Lan Hai stopped walking and turned around. He was staring face to face with Lin Feng. His face was twisted and ugly. He was trying to smile but tears rolled down his cheeks and whimpers escaped his mouth.\u201cLin Feng, you know that this has nothing to do with me. It was the young Miss who ordered us to kill you. I only acted under orders as it is my duty, nothing more.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Said Lin Feng while nodding which made Na Lan Hai suddenly regain hope. \u201cThat is why I must put the dog out of its misery, otherwise it will continue to be forced to do these things by its master\u201d Immediately after, Na Lan Hai saw a bright silver light flash through the air and it was the last thing he saw. His head had been cleanly removed from his body.When Lin Feng saw Na Lan Hai collapse, he remained expressionless. He turned around and saw the piles of corpses. There were dozens upon dozens of corpses lying on the ground. The soil had been dyed red with the blood spilt. He did not have time to stop, instead he started walking into the distance.\u201cNa Lan Feng.\u201dA low voice echoed through the darkness of the night and it seemed like the darkness was moving.Lin Feng didn\u2019t know how long he had been walking. He arrived in a territory under nobody\u2019s control. He sat in meditation on the ground. His body was absorbing the Qi of heaven and earth and releasing it from his body at the same time. The Qi around Lin Feng\u2019s body turned into a glowing essence. That essence surrounded his body like an aura. His dark spirit was thrashing around. Lin Feng knew that he was about to break through to the Ling Qi layer. It was said that the spirit is a part of one\u2019s soul. The soul could provide many unique abilities. While sitting on the ground, Lin Feng\u2019s eyebrows strongly shook. At that moment, Lin Feng had a very strange feeling but he was unable to describe it. It was as if something was calling out to him. At that moment, Lin Feng felt a strong pain throughout his body. He knew that the most dangerous moment had arrived.Only those with an extremely strong determination were able to make their spirit awaken. Everybody knew that on the continent, without an extremely strong willpower and determination, the spirit could not awaken. The pain became stronger and stronger. Lin Feng felt like his soul was being torn into pieces, slice by slice, piece by piece. Lin Feng was suffering so much that he bit his lips so hard that blood began to flow.\u201cSo painful, how can it be so painful?\u201d Lin Feng had underestimated the moment of the spirit awakening. He would have never thought that it would be so painful. He had nearly died in the past. The pain that he had endured before was nothing in comparison with that of the spirit awakening. This pain was inhumane. It gradually stopped raining but Lin Feng did not notice. Lin Feng was still soaked but he wasn\u2019t sure if it was because of the rain or because of the sweat. He only knew that his body was in agonizing pain.\u201cAHHHHH\u201d shouted Lin Feng extremely loudly. The pain hadn\u2019t stopped. An even stronger pain invaded his body. The soul was being torn apart even more than before. It made him wish he could die and end his suffering.\u201cIf I am unable to endure this pain, my spirit will never awaken. I will have to continue being bullied by others like when my father and I had to leave the Lin Clan. Lin Qian or the Na Lan clan will continue to make attempts on my life. These repeated humiliations were unbearable. One person can only take so much humiliation and regret.\u201d Lin Feng persevered and kept thinking about his Father and the humiliation he recieved. Nobody could stop him at that moment, nobody could prevent him from becoming stronger, not even the gods. The pain was unable to make Lin Feng lose hope and determination. It seemed like Lin Feng\u2019s willpower was actually willing the pain away. Lin Feng also became more relaxed in his heart. His spirit should be able to awaken without any problem.\u201cAAAA\u2026..AAAAAAHHHHH!!\u201d Lin Feng gave a shout with unprecedented brutality. Lin Feng was suddenly shaking from head to toe. A pain infinitely stronger than what he had previously gone through until that moment invaded his body. It made Lin Feng close his eyes and grit his teeth. The seven apertures of Lin Feng\u2019s head, eyes, ears, nostrils and mouth were all bleeding.\u201cFUCK!! NOO! I cannot go like this!!!\u201d Lin Feng cursed. Immediately after, Lin Feng collapsed lifelessly on the floor.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 - Spirit AwakeningPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 43: Spirit AwakeningLin Feng had fallen into a dream like state. In this dream state his soul had drifted from his body. His soul was floating through the endless darkness, it seemed like a world made only of darkness.In this dark world, there was no sign of life. Lin Feng didn\u2019t know how long his soul had been trapped inside the darkness. There was only a single light within the darkness, it was a small radiant light which had fascinated him.\u201cWhat an amazing light!\u201d The more Lin Feng approached that light, the brighter and the more gorgeous it became. He found out that the light was stretching through the infinite darkness and it was impossible to reach. The light had formed a spiral above his head and became a very familiar shape, it shaped itself as a book. It seemed like the Qi of the entire universe was within this book and had been there since the creation of the universe. This book had seemed to contain all of the information of the entire universe since the beginning of time itself. Lin Feng stared at the book as if it was a precious gift which had been given to him by the universe, his eyes were radiating a fascinated light. When Lin Feng opened the book and looked inside, he found endless words streaming through the pages. The stream of words began to flow off the page and into Lin Feng\u2019s body, it seemed like all of the information recorded within the book was being absorbed into Lin Feng\u2019s body.\u201cBOOM!\u201dA sound rang through the air, it had sounded like Lin Feng\u2019s body had exploded from the amount of information being absorbed through his skin. Lin Feng couldn\u2019t help but powerlessly sit down on the ground. He had returned from the world of darkness and was sat down on the floor. The night was still dark and the rain was heavily pouring from the sky, it had seemed like almost no time had passed while he was inside that darkness. How could he find that magnificent book which contained such information? How could he return the sacred and magnificent light within the darkness?\u201cPhewww\u2026 Phewww\u2026\u201d Lin Feng was breathing heavily. His body was shaking from the pain, his body had long passed the limit for how much pain he could endure. However he was still alive and thanks to that pain, he had seen a world of darkness which seemed to contain the secrets of the universe.When Lin Feng had been suffering from torture a moment before, he had really thought he was going to die from the pain of having his soul shredded. The pain was beyond any he had ever felt in this world, how could a human being endure such a pain? The pain had been so severe that he had actually collapsed and almost died.\u201cDo other people have to go through such a pain and agony when they try to awaken their spirit?\u201d Lin Feng was looking at the deep into the darkness of the night. He did not understand how so many people had awakened their spirit through so much pain, he had actually believed for a moment that he had died. Even though Lin Feng didn\u2019t think that he was gifted or talented, he did have some confidence in his own will power. He could not help but think how people with less will power than himself could even endure half the pain which had struck his body. When his spirit was attempting to awaken, he was filled with three phases of endless pain which invaded his body and shredded his soul. Each time he was stuck by the pain, it was more intense and terrifying than before. During the final phase, the pain was so terrifying that his body had actually collapsed, while his mind could endure, his body had collapsed from the pain. Thanks to his determination and infinite willpower, he had been able to endure the pain for much longer than his body should have been able. That is why he hadn\u2019t immediately collapsed and instead he had started to bleed from his ears, eyes, nose and mouth.\u201cMaybe, the moment when the spirit awakens is a different experience for every person. Maybe it was only like this for me because of my spirit.\u201d While saying his thoughts out loud, Lin Feng\u2019s heart started pounding and he released his spirit. Lin Feng suddenly had an indescribable sensation. His surroundings seemed to have completely changed. Lin Feng wasn\u2019t in the same place any longer, instead he had returned to the world of darkness. This time however he could feel his surroundings and was much more aware of everything around him. He had the faint sense that he could see and hear everything around him, even though it was all in darkness. He could sense the grass as it swayed from the wind that was blowing. He could sense every raindrop as it fell heavily onto the ground. He had become extremely calm and he began to sense everything around him. He continued to move around and sense the changes. He did not know how much he had changed or how powerful his senses were at this point, but it seemed that at this moment he had become omniscient. He could sense everything in the world around his, it was all part of him.What was evening more shocking to Lin Feng was that he was able to see everything, however the eyes he was using did not look like his own eyes. They were terrifying eyes which did not look human. He could not help but tremble when looking into the eyes, what a scary feeling they gave. \u201dDark\u2026 spirit.\u201d Lin Feng realized his brain was much faster than before and he could comprehend things more clearly than before. The power of his spirit was almost scary to him. It seemed like his power was as infinite as the darkness around him. His heart started pounding again. A colossal shadow had emerged from his back. The shadow itself was shaped as a spiral. On the top of the shadow, there was a magnificent and sacred looking book in suspension. The book began to open.\u201cIs this a spirit?\u201d Lin Feng had a questioning look in his eyes. It seemed like that shadow was able to influence Lin Feng\u2019s spirit which he had released into the darkness. Everything seemed to be so clear. The scene looked just like in his dream: an endless darkness, and within that darkness was a bright light. The book had appeared and was floating quietly above his head. In Lin Feng\u2019s memories, a spirit which could be released twice didn\u2019t exist. It was as if that spirit had two layers which could be released. The first layer was a shadow which merged with the world itself and created the world of darkness. The second layer was a celestial book. Lin Feng had thought that his spirit had initially failed to fully awaken. But not only did it seem that it hadn\u2019t failed, but that it also had gone beyond common knowledge.\u201cCelestial book\u2026 A book spirit\u2026\u201d Lin Feng didn\u2019t know what kind of spirit he had at that moment. In the Continent of the Nine Clouds, there was an infinite amount of skills and spirits. The awakening of a spirit also constituted a considerable change. There weren\u2019t many people who could fully understand the mysteries of spirits. They only knew that there were a lot of different spirits which would all be different once awakened, depending on the person who had awakened the spirit. The book spirit was a mysterious and mystical one, Lin Feng was in awe. Its strength didn\u2019t reside in releasing attacks or protecting him during a fight. It was inefficient in both offence and defense but those who possessed a book spirit could write down unusual things within the book. These unusual and extraordinary things could greatly influence the cultivation speed of those who possessed such a spirit.\u201cOh my god\u2026\u201d Lin Feng sighed. Suddenly, within the dark pupils shone two radiant silver lights, it looked like the sun was shining within these dark eyes. It happened for short moment and then the silver lights disappeared. Lin Feng was thinking deeply. These small lights meant that the first page of the book had been opened. It seemed like he had been granted magical powers by the universe.\u201cI will call you my celestial spirit.\u201d Lin Feng whispered. His spirit gradually dissipated and Lin Feng\u2019s eyes became normal again. His eyes returned to normal and the terrifying darkness had left. He could see clearly and normally. He only had a strange sensation remaining on his back. He turned his head, a white colored Qi was still flowing from his body endlessly. Lin Feng could use the Qi heaven and earth as he wished, he could create a shocking power with this Qi. Lin Feng had broken through to the Ling Qi layer. After the awakening of his dark spirit which was the first layer, he was able to release the second layer of his celestial spirit. Even though his small snake spirit hadn\u2019t been able to awaken, Lin Feng was still extremely satisfied.Releasing the first layer of his celestial spirit would be enough to greatly increase his strength. The second layer, his book spirit, would provide him with support which would benefit him on his path of cultivation and it did not require being released for him to gain the benefits.\u201cFirst Ling Qi layer\u2026 From now on, I am unstoppable.\u201d thought Lin Feng confidently while smiling. He could feel how terrifying the changes were within his dark spirit. The first layer of his celestial spirit was his dark spirit, but its power was terrifying. From that moment, if Lin Feng met Lin Qian, he would have no problem defeating her. Even if Lin Qian was extremely arrogant, she still had an ice and fire universal spirit, but it was nothing when compared with his dark spirit. It was still raining but the sun had started to rise on the horizon. Some rays of sunlight had started passing through the atmosphere. Lin Feng stood up and looked at his clothes which were soaked from the rain. He couldn\u2019t help but smile. Sitting outside all night had been an insane experience. Lin Feng raised his head and gazed into the distance and he thought about what had happened during the night when he had ruthlessly slaughtered dozens of cultivators back in the city. If he had been a little bit weaker, he would have died in a tragic death.\u201cNa Lan Clan of Yangzhou City, Na Lan Feng, you will sooner rather than later, regret what you did last night.\u201d Lin Feng stood up and started walking.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Please let me know if this problem still occurs!Enjoy xoxoxIn Yangzhou City, on City Avenue there was a huge crowd gathered. The atmosphere was extremely lively and noisy.\u201cSix people, plus Qiu Lan\u2026 there is still one spot left. That\u2019s much too scary. Each and every one of them is extremely strong. I will definitely take the final spot\u201d said a young man in the crowd confidently.\u201cIn your dreams\u2026 They already chose the eighth one; it\u2019s Feng Qian. Feng Qian is at the ninth Qi layer. He\u2019s much stronger than anyone else within the clan. A moment ago, he didn\u2019t insist on participating but that\u2019s just that he didn\u2019t feel like it\u2026 He has now made his move because he was annoyed that he was not selected sooner. How could you possibly fight against Feng Qian?\u201d Said the person standing beside him.\u201cScary.\u201d Said the young manWhen the young man heard the name \u201cFeng Qian\u201d, his face changed in a flash. He felt extremely depressed. It seemed that this time, the Clan head wasn\u2019t going to choose him. The Na Lan Clan had always organized an annual tournament, however this year, apart from the four biggest clans, and external clans who were not located in Yangzhou City, outstanding disciples belonging to other small clans could also participate. However, these small clans were only allowed to send eight disciples to participate in the tournament. On the same basis, the clans within the city, the Na Lan Clan, the Gu Clan, the Lin Clan and the Wen Clan were also allowed a maximum of eight disciples. These disciples were supposed to represent the most outstanding disciples of Yangzhou City. This had made participating in the tournament a real honor and privilege which would allow outstanding disciples of all clans to show their abilities to a large number of people.Unfortunately for some people, the Na Lan Clan as well as the other three big clans had already chosen their participants. Qiu Lan was chosen as one of the participants, because she was extremely strong. At that moment, there were already seven people which meant the clan had to choose one last disciple and this position in the tournament was most likely to be Feng Qian.Feng Qian was wearing blue robes. He was slim and had an arrogant look on his face. At that moment, he had arms folded over his chest as he walked out of the crowd and said in a cold and detached way: \u201cThat last participant is me.\u201dWhen people saw how arrogant he looked, they could not help but be filled with hatred and regret. Some of the younger generation wanted to duel with him and measure themselves against him but considering his strength, they had to be careful. It seemed like they were only going to be able to watch as members of the audience. Feng Qian looked at the several hundreds of people who were present with a look of disdain.\u201cSo many pieces of trash. They are all cowards. No wonder they were not chosen and I\u2019m the one who was chosen to participate.\u201d Said Feng Qian in a spiteful tone as he started to head towards the main hall. In the main hall, there were already seven people sitting in a calm state. These were precisely Qiu Lan as well as the six others who had been chosen to participate.\u201cThat guy is really as arrogant as the rumors say.\u201d\u201cThey say that he is extremely cruel to all of his opponents and will even use diabolic methods to win.\u201d\u201cWho would dare challenge him? The consequences of challenging him would only be disastrous.\u201d\u201cHe would probably cripple their Cultivation.\u201dSaid the many people in the crowd. Even though many people hated Feng Qian, nobody dared open their mouth. Feng Qian was savage and cruel. Amongst people of the Qi layer, there were very few people who could defeat him which made him even more arrogant and prideful, he enjoyed bullying those weaker than him.The people within the crowd had no choice but to look at him join the others in the main hall.\u201cWait, wait, wait.\u201d said a loud voice. In the quiet crowd, that voice was particularly clear and loud. The crowd was surprised for a moment and then they could see a young man approaching from the distance. This young man was wearing white robes. Even though his robes didn\u2019t look expensive, he looked clean and pure from head to toe. He was carrying a long sword on his back. His body was looked sturdy but gentle. The crowd found him fascinating. He looked as limpid as water. He gave an aura of mystery to all those who laid eyes on him.His clear eyes were filled with deep profound understanding. His appearance and age did not seem to match with his wisdom. When people in the crowd saw him, they were gasping with admiration and had a feeling of inferiority in his presence.The young man who had appeared was actually Lin Feng after having had a shower and changed his clothes. After having asked around, he had quickly learnt that there was a selection for the upcoming tournament happening and he quickly hurried to the location.Feng Qian looked at Lin Feng, his arms still folded over his chest. He looked at Lin Feng in a disdainful way while grinning and said.\u201cYou are telling me to wait?\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d Said Lin Feng looking like he didn\u2019t understand Feng Qian\u2019s expression. He indifferently nodded.Feng Qian was still grinning and then looked at Lin Feng as if he had compassion for him, even though Lin Feng was a few years younger than him. He then smiled and said: \u201cDo you know the consequences for making me wait?\u201dLin Feng smiled wryly and was a bit surprised. On the path of cultivation, there were many people who were talented and thought they were geniuses. It seemed like those kinds of people liked to show off their powers against those weaker than themselves, as if they were playing a role which had to appear noble and strong. It had become clear to him that people in this world would continue to play these roles and act foolishly for the sake of appearances.Lin Feng started walking towards Feng Qian with complete calmness on his face.The crowd was wondering what was going on and started to watch Lin Feng. Was that guy insane? He was about sixteen years so he could have only reached the seventh or eighth Qi layer, yet he still thought he could compete with Feng Qian who belonged to one of the most powerful of the small clans in Yangzhou City and he was even considered a genius. That young guy wanted to challenge Feng Qian\u2026 but only the most talented, the most gifted and the most outstanding disciples of Yangzhou City could compete with him. How could this unknown young man possibly fit that criteria.\u201cIt looks like you also want to enter into the main hall. I really don\u2019t know if I should admire you for your courage, but what you\u2019re doing is extremely foolish\u2026 however since you want to challenge me, I will cripple your cultivation for being foolish enough to think you are worthy to stand on the same level as me.\u201d said Feng Qian clearly directing his hatred towards Lin Feng.\u201cShiiing!\u201dThe metallic sound of a sword cutting through the air filled the atmosphere and a bright light filled the space in front of Feng Qian. Immediately after, Feng Qian fell down onto the ground and began to roll around while groaning. Blood was pouring out of his mouth. He was coughing heavily and more blood was filling his mouth. Feng Qian raised himself to the point he was kneeling on one knee. Blood was unceasingly spilling out of his mouth\u2026 drops of blood were endlessly falling onto the ground.Lin Feng simply put his sword back into his sheathe with a \u2018Clink\u2019 sound.The people within the crowd just stared at what had happened in shock. They were all trembling with excitement and fear. Lin Feng\u2026 had Lin Feng defeated Feng Qian in a single strike?\u201cHow powerful!\u201d said a man while shivers ran down his spine. Not only was he about sixteen years old but Feng Qian had been unable to carry out one single attack against him. Lin Feng had even shown mercy and had been gentle when using his sword, otherwise, Feng Qian would have immediately been killed.\u201cYou really do talk crap, way too much crap. You should be more careful with your words\u201d said Lin Feng in a cold tone while not even looking at Feng Qian who was behind him, kneeling on the floor. Then, Lin Feng continued walking towards the main hall. Feng Qian was looking at Lin Feng with disdain\u2026 and in the end Lin Feng didn\u2019t even give him another glance as he wasn\u2019t worth it. While looking at Lin Feng from behind, Feng Qian had a million thoughts at the same time.\u201d You really do talk crap, way too much crap. You should be more careful with your words.\u201d He continued to repeat the words that Lin Feng said to him.The path of cultivation is full of surprises. The sky is vast and the ocean is deep, who knows exactly how vast and deep they are. The world could be flipped upside down in instances, some cultivators believed themselves lucky to be such strong geniuses only to find they are only small fish in a very large pond. To keep being lucky, to remain a strong genius, a cultivator would need to possess a strong willpower and determination towards training. A cultivator like Feng Qian of the ninth Qi layer was like a frog at the bottom of a well. He could not see how vast the world really was. Therefore, being arrogant and provoking wasn\u2019t a good behavior to adopt and Lin Feng\u2019s sword had taught him a long deserved lesson. Strength was everything in this world.While struggling to get onto his feet, Feng Qian was looking at Lin Feng\u2019s back and was bowing. He wasn\u2019t holding awe and veneration for Lin Feng, it was rather that he felt thankful that Lin Feng had taught him that his arrogance could cost him his life and gave him a great lesson: the road of cultivation is not one in which you should provoke others. It was also not one in which you could allow yourself to be provoked without retaliation.That event had made a lot of people feel puzzled but some people\u2019s expressions were resplendent as if they had understood what had just happened in front of them. However, Lin Feng hadn\u2019t noticed these expressions. He wasn\u2019t completely in the main hall yet when the seven others\u2019 expressions suddenly changed when they saw him approaching. Qiu Lan was particularly surprised. In the Whistle Wind Restaurant, she had seen him and obviously knew a lot about Lin Feng. She also knew everything about the problems Lin Feng had within the Lin Clan.\u201cI will be participating in the tournament this year.\u201d Lin Feng said sounding relaxed yet strict while looking at Qiu Lan. He was bold and straightforward, he insisted that he had to participate.\u201cHow audacious!\u201d said a disciple sitting next to Qiu Lan while slapping the table, which made the wooden table crack in a loud bang. \u201dWho do you think you are? Thinking that you can actually talk to Qiu Lan as you wish.\u201d said the angered disciple, he was called Wu Xiao. Everybody was fantasizing about the beautiful Qiu Lan. Besides, she was extremely powerful and was at the pinnacle beyond the ninth Qi layer. Feng Qian\u2019s power was nothing in comparison.He had seen how Lin Feng had defeated Feng Qian in one hit and how easy it had seemed for Lin Feng. He had thus noticed how strong Lin Feng was. Therefore, at that moment, Wu Xiao\u2019s behavior was just an empty show of strength to gain Qiu Lan\u2019s attention and make her like him.Lin Feng glanced at Wu Xiao and then walked towards him after which Wu Xiao immediately stood up and released a strong Qi, ready to engage in a battle.The white and dazzling light of the sword flashed and stabbed Wu Xiao so quickly that he had had no time to react at all. He gave a horrible shriek not able to strike back.Speed. After having broken through to the Ling Qi layer, Lin Feng\u2019s swordplay had become incredibly quick and agile, even more so than before. Lin Feng grabbed Wu Xiao\u2019s neck and carried him to the entrance of the main hall.\u201cWhy would a piece of trash like you, want to participate in the tournament? How pointless.\u201dWhile saying this in a loud voice, Lin Feng kicked Wu Xiao\u2019s body which flew out of the main hall and rolled down the steps onto the ground of the main square where the crowd was.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I hope you all enjoy the build upEnjoy xoxoxo2A5\u201cIs that Wu Xiao?\u201d\u201cIt is, it is Wu Xiao.\u201dShouts of surprise filled the air around the crowd as they watched Wu Xiao fly out of the main hall and roll down the steps.Wu Xiao was much stronger than Feng Qian. He was quite famous in Yangzhou City, but this genius had also been defeated by that unknown young man who had entered the main hall. Being injured and publicly humiliated was the price that he paid for angering Lin Feng. Lin Feng had shown him no mercy and insulted him as he kicked him from the main hall.\u201cWho is that young disciple?\u201d\u201cHow arrogant!\u201d\u201cWhich clan does he belong to?\u201d\u201cI have never seen him before today, where did he come from?\u201dEverybody who was there wanted to know who that young man was. They did not believe that there was such a genius within Yangzhou City who had escaped their attention for so long, a disciple who was this strong would have come to the attention of the smaller clans by now. However they had absolutely no idea who this young man was, How was such a thing possible?If everyone knew who that arrogant and domineering young man who had just entered the main hall was, they would be astonished to know that it was the piece of trash who had been expelled from the Lin Clan. According to the rumors he was expelled along with his father for being trash, his father had even attacked a junior clan member to protect Lin Feng. They would be shocked that the trash within these rumors was the powerful and domineering young man in front of their eyes. The other disciples, who were in the main hall all belonged to the smaller clans within Yangzhou City, they were all the talented and powerful members of the younger generations. The disciples who made up the eight participants were the strongest talents which the smaller clans could develop.The day of the annual tournament had finally arrived and there was a huge commotion as the crowd watched members from the larger clans arrive in the arena. This would be a chance for them to see all of the talents which would shape the future of the city. They would not have this opportunity often.\u201cLook over there, seated on the southern part of the arena are the members of the Lin Clan. The one in the middle is Lin Ba Dao. It looks like the rumors are true, Lin Hai\u2019s Cultivation was crippled by Lin Ba Dao and then his son and him were expelled from the Lin Clan.\u201d Discussions could be heard while many people were looking at where the Lin Clan members were sitting. One could hear all sorts of comments from the crowd. There was a constant discussion and many people were paying attention to the Lin Clan because of the rumors which were circulating in Yangzhou City. It had caused a sensation throughout the city. At that moment, the rumors were confirmed.\u201cThat\u2019s Lin Qian\u2026 how beautiful! But she\u2019s a bit scary, she has already broken through to the Ling Qi layer\u2026 and she\u2019s only sixteen years old. She\u2019s amazing. I wish she could on day become my wife.\u201d\u201c\u201dIn your dreams\u2026 oh keep it down, if people from the Lin Clan hear you, they\u2019ll cripple your cultivation or even worse behead you.\u201d\u201cHehe, I\u2019m just saying. Look over there, the Na Lan Clan has also arrived, that\u2019s the head of the City and the princess Na Lan Feng.\u201dThe crowd continued to make comments as the people arrived in the arena. At that moment, the members of the Na Lan Clan had already arrived and had taken their respective seats in the arena, close to the stage.Na Lan Xiong was famous, tall and sturdy, he looked extremely prestigious. Only by looking at him, it was easy to guess that he had an extraordinary power.When Na La Xiong saw the expressions of the people in the crowd, he smiled and then immediately said: \u201cToday, everybody was able to come to the tournament that I organized. I, Na Lan Xiong, am extremely happy. However, if anyone dares to make trouble, I, Na Lan Xiong, will not hesitate and will deal with you in a very rude manner.\u201dMany people nodded. They were facing the Na Lan Clan\u2026 even if they wanted to cause trouble, they first needed the skills and abilities to do so.\u201cAlright, enough with my useless speech. I know that all of you haven\u2019t come to listen to an old man like me. Let\u2019s invite our outstanding young cultivators to come onto the battle stage, alright?\u201d said Na Lan Xiong and then he sat down. Everybody nodded when he finished speaking. All the young and outstanding disciples were getting ready to make their appearance on the stage.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 - The Tournament BeginsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySpecial Thanks to Velkin for this sponsored chapter. This is the third release and my goal tonight is eight\u2026Wish me luck. I hope you all enjoy xoxoxThe huge battle arena was composed of many fighting stages. On each of the fighting stages, eight silhouettes could be seen. The Na Lan Clan was set higher than the others and its participants were standing on the highest stage in the middle of all the others. They looked like warlords looking down with supremacy. The other participants surrounded them on their own fighting stage like the stars surrounded the moon in the night sky. There was also the major clans such as the Gu Clan, the Lin Clan, the Wen Clan. Qiu Lan had played a big role in the organization of the smaller clans. At that moment, along with the Na Lan Clan members, there was an old man sitting next to Na Lan Xiong who stood up. He was staring at the fighting stages.\u201cToday is our yearly tournament. The purpose of this tournament is to test the strength of the most outstanding young cultivators of Yangzhou City. Therefore, nobody should show mercy. Those who are defeated are allowed to surrender and in case someone gives up, the fight will immediately be terminated. If nobody surrenders the fight then the fight will continue unceasingly until someone collapses, or even dies.\u201dWhen the old man finished talking and the crowd burst into uproar\u2026 the fights could go on until someone died if nobody gave up\u2026 how cruel! There were some extremely proud and arrogant cultivators who attached a lot of importance to their face and prestige. Losing a battle by giving up was especially humiliating for them. Therefore, very few people were going to willingly surrender a battle. Even if they knew that they had no chance of winning, they would continue to fight to protect their honor and dignity. But that sentence made the crowd think carefully. There were no restrictions and battles could be fought to the death. If there had been restrictions, two opponents of an equal strength who refused to give up, could be fighting endlessly which could end up in a deep and bitter hatred for the opponent.\u201cHow wise, how brilliant!\u201d said many people supporting the old man\u2019s words. The old man had obviously done this as a ploy to increase the hatred between the other clans, by forcing them to watch as their talented clan members would rather die than surrender. He had done this to stop the hatred between the younger generations, but increase the hatred of the older generations. That way, those who didn\u2019t agree wouldn\u2019t criticize the Na Lan Clan. After all, they were the clan who was hosting the tournament and had made a perfectly reasonable rule. However, it also meant that Na Lan Clan members could be killed within the arena. The crowd knew they were going to see some people die and that the different clans of Yangzhou City would once again sow the seeds of hatred for one another. Na Lan Xiong wanted to see the other clans hate each other. Even though the three other clans knew what Na Lan Xiong had in mind, they had no choice but to agree.Since they didn\u2019t want to lose face and as they were considered as the best clans in the city, all they could do was tell their young disciples to strive for victory with all their strength. Besides, the old man had also said that those who wished could give up and the battle would immediately end. Therefore, that rule was double-edged and couldn\u2019t be really contradicted as the choice was given\u2026 But who would accept having their own clan regarded as inferior to the others?\u201cI finished writing down the names of all those who are participating in this year\u2019s tournament. I have also finished organizing the battles. I don\u2019t know if anyone has any objections to my work.\u201d Said the old man while looking at the members of the three other powerful clans.\u201cHehe, everything was organized by the Na Lan Clan\u2026 I, of course, agree.\u201d Said the head of the Gu Clan even though it seemed like he didn\u2019t really care.\u201cThe previous tournaments were organized by the Na Lan Clan and were managed by them as well, this time is obviously going to be the same.\u201d\u201cI have no objection either.\u201d said Lin Ba Dao who was obviously not going to oppose the Na Lan Clan.\u201cI represent the Na Lan Clan and I would like to thank all the clan heads for their cooperation.\u201d said the old man while looking at the members of the three other clans and then declared: \u201cThe rules are as such and are applied from the very first battle: being defeated leads to elimination, winning allows you to continue.\u201d\u201cAnd now, let me announce what the battles will be. All of those who hear their names can stay on stage, the others can come down and wait. On the Na Lan\u2019s stage, Na Lan Feng will fight against Wen Xin of the Wen Clan; on the Eastern Stage, Gu Yun of the Gu Clan will fight against Lin Wu of the Lin Clan; on the Southern Stage, Lin Yu of the Lin Clan will fight against Wen Feng of the Wen Clan; on the Western stage, Na Lan Zhu of the Na Lan Clan will fight against Feng Qian; on the Northern stage, Duo Ming will fight against Gu Qing Jr. of the Gu Clan.\u201dThere were five fighting stages, so there could be only ten people fighting at once. There were forty people in total. Four rounds were enough to eliminate half of them and so that only twenty people would be left. Those who hadn\u2019t been called stepped down from the stages while those who had been called were going onto their respective stages.\u201cHahaha, Wen Xin is really unlucky, having to fight Na Lan Feng as a first battle.\u201dEven though Wen Xin was not weak, she had no chance to win.\u201cI heard that Lin Wu of the Lin Clan has become quite strong. He has already reached the ninth Qi layer. It seems like he\u2019s definitely going to be the one to win the battle on Eastern Stage.\u201d\u201cOn the southern stage, Wen Feng should win the battle. On the Northern Stage, Feng Qian should win. Concerning the last stage, even though Duo Ming is extremely mysterious and wearing a mask, Gu Qing Jr. is almost invincible so Duo Ming is pretty unlucky there.\u201dThe battles hadn\u2019t even started and everyone in the crowd was making predictions as if they were certain of the outcomes. After all, the crowd knew almost all these young disciples, who the majority had originated from Yangzhou City, and had a deep understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.But on the Northern Stage, Duo Ming also attracted the crowd\u2019s attention. He was wearing a mask, they had never heard of him and there was something fascinating which surrounded him like an aura. He carried an air of mystery. Too bad that he was going to fight Gu Qing Jr. He was already doomed and was going to lose immediately. Indeed, Gu Qing Jr. had already reached the peak of the Qi layer. There were not a lot of Cultivators of the Qi Layer who could fight against him and win. His only real opponents were mostly within the Ling Qi layer. Gu Qing Jr. was also quite famous in the region. Thus, it was impossible for Duo Ming to defeat Gu Qing Jr.The predictions of the crowd were also quite accurate. Wen Xin didn\u2019t fight against Na Lan Feng and gave up. Even though face and prestige were extremely important, giving up when facing Na Lan Feng was nothing to be ashamed of. Fighting against Na Lan Feng definitely meant dying.On the Eastern and Western stages, results were gradually coming out and the predictions of the crowd were correct each time. Lin Wu, Wen Feng and Feng Qian were about to defeat their opponents and move onto the next round of the tournament. Only the battle on the Northern Stage was still in progress and it had made everyone within the crowd grow speechless.In Gu Qing Jr.\u2019s eyes, Duo Ming didn\u2019t even exist, he regarded Duo Ming as an ant to crush beneath his boot on his path to cultivation. Gu Qing Jr. kept looking at the battles on the other stages rather than defeating his own opponent. After all, he would be able to move forward to the next round at any time he wanted, so he wanted to get familiar with the fighting styles of his following opponents.\u201cI will not fight against Na Lan Feng, so I hope I will not be matched with her in the upcoming battles. Lin Wu and Wen Feng will be very easy to defeat. As far as Feng Qian is concerned, it seems like his strength has greatly improved recently but I should be able to dispose of him really quickly as well. Victory will be a piece of cake if I have to fight these three\u2026\u201dGu Qing Jr. was lost in deep thought and continued to act as if the young man who was wearing the silver mask didn\u2019t exist at all while thinking about the next rounds.Finally, Feng Qian had his hand on his opponent Na Lan Zhu\u2019s throat. Na Lan Zhu didn\u2019t want to keep fighting and surrendered the fight. Everybody\u2019s attention was on the Northern Stage.\u201cIt finished. How quick!\u201d said the crowd amazed. It seemed like the first round was about to come to an end.\u201cGu Qing, stop wasting time.\u201d said the head of the Gu Clan sounding indifferent yet slightly arrogant as if Gu Qing could end the battle as soon as he wished.\u201cAlright, I will do as the clan head requests.\u201d replied Gu Qing Jr. Then, he looked at Lin Feng who was hiding his identity with a silver mask and said coldly:\u201cGet down from here yourself, you\u2019re not worth fighting.\u201d Lin Feng touched his silver mask, one could only see his eyes and a small part of his face but it was impossible to see his facial expression.Lin Feng had also been ignoring Gu Qing Jr. he hadn\u2019t hurried to fight and had also been observing the other battles. He didn\u2019t have to worry now either. Gu Qing Jr. was extremely arrogant and rather than fighting had told him to get off the stage. Lin Feng was already used to those cultivators who thought that they were untouchable and did not give respect to others, but demanded respect in return, those so-called geniuses.\u201cDid you not hear what I just said? I\u2019m telling you to get down from here\u2026 so get lost! If you are not smart enough to get down yourself, I will immediately kill you.\u201d Gu Qing Jr. saw that Lin Feng wasn\u2019t reacting at all and then frowned.The talented individuals within the powerful clans despised cultivators who considered themselves as geniuses but didn\u2019t belong to a clan which held a status like the powerful clans. Without the strong support behind them, they would have to work extremely hard for minimal gains. How could a cultivator become a man of great talent if he didn\u2019t belong to a powerful clan? People like Dou Ming who didn\u2019t belong to a powerful clan would have no reputation and could be disposed of by his clan at any point. That is why Gu Qing Jr. despised such cultivators and regarded them as beneath his notice.\u201cI haven\u2019t changed my mind yet so seize that opportunity and get lost.\u201d said Lin Feng in a voice full of hatred. As he spat out those words filled with hatred, it had surprised everyone in the crowd. Right after, some people grinned, could it be that that guy was insane?Qiu Lan wasn\u2019t laughing though. She thought that Lin Feng was very mysterious, almost mystical. He seemed extremely strong compared to others within the tournament. She had seen how Lin Feng had made Wu Xiao collapse with just a single strike.\u201cGu Qing Jr., I hope you are prepared to die.\u201d shouted Feng Qian who was focusing on what was going on the Northern Stage. He had come to understand that Gu Qing Jr.\u2019s behavior would just lead to his death. After receiving a lesson from Lin Feng, he has greatly matured and come to realize his own mistake. The less respect that was given to Lin Feng, the less mercy he would show.Gu Qing Jr.\u2019s face at that moment had changed and he no longer looked as if he was at ease. He couldn\u2019t believe what Lin Feng had just said to him. He couldn\u2019t believe that a young man, who didn\u2019t belong to a powerful clan such as his own, would dare to talk to him that way. He was the second ranked disciple of the Gu Clan amongst all the disciples of the Qi layer. He was regarded as an extremely strong and talented disciple by all the members of the Gu Clan.\u201cFinish him.\u201d Gu Qing Sr said in a loud yet calm voice which made everyone shiver. Lin Feng would lose, that was obvious but Gu Qing Sr meant that he wanted Gu Qing to kill Lin Feng where he stood.\u201cAlright.\u201d said Gu Qing Jr. who noticed that his father, who was also the clan head, had become extremely furious. He quickly started moving at an incredible speed. He wasn\u2019t going to give Lin Feng any chance to surrender.\u201cPoisonous Fist!\u201d shouted Gu Qing Jr.His fist was emitting a whistling sound as it started breaking through the air as if he was shattering the atmosphere into pieces.But Lin Feng remained motionless like a mountain. At the moment when the poisonous fist was about to reach him, a bright light flashed in front of his body. The sword was too fast for anyone to see what had happened.It seemed like time had stopped and everything remained motionless. No one in the crowd had seen what had happened or why Gu Qing Jr had stopped moving. Suddenly Gu Qing Jr\u2019s body fell heavily onto the ground as his head started to roll away from his body. The crowd stared on in complete silence.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47 - Duo Ming\u2019s SwordPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis was a slightly harder chapter for me. Very long and needed a few rewrites. To all those coming from Reddit, share the love over there!!! I need the love from you guys to punish myself to this extent for you hahaSpecial Thanks again to Velkin for this chapter. xoxoI hope you all enjoy!The crowd was looking at Gu Qing Jr.\u2019s dead body lying on the ground of the Northern Stage. He had been killed with a single strike which was so fast that many could only see Lin Feng sheathing his sword. Not only had the strong and powerful Gu Qing been killed in a single strike, but he had also been killed in the blink of an eye and had been given no chance to surrender.\u201cThat sword\u2026 how fast! How skillful!\u201d Said a man in the crowd, mouth wide open, almost drooling. They hadn\u2019t even been able to see what had happened as the movements were so fast. The crowd was unable to see what kind of sword skill had been used by this mysterious masked disciple. They only knew that it had happened with extreme speed and precision. The sword had disappeared as quickly as it had appeared.Only someone who had practiced his skills to perfection was able to carry out such precise attacks, his sword looked like an agile shadow that avoided the gazes of the crowd. The crowd was looking at Lin Feng and thinking about the flash they had just seen. He had obviously used a sword skill during that split second and with it unleashed devastating power. He had been able to kill Gu Qing Jr. with ease.\u201cAmazing!\u201d Feng Qian was looking at Lin Feng speechless. He imagined what would have happened if he had been the one fighting against Lin Feng. He would not have noticed the sword before his head was already removed from his body. Even if what had happened the previous day had changed his views and had made him more determined and respectful, even with a few more years of cultivation, he wouldn\u2019t want to face the Lin Feng before him.Gu Qing Sr. stood up while looking at the battle stage. His face grew red with fury and his face viciously twisted in anger. While looking at his son\u2019s headless corpse on the battle stage, he released an extremely strong Qi. Gu Qing Jr. was dead\u2026 One of the most outstanding junior disciples of the Gu Clan was dead. He hadn\u2019t been able to even react to his opponents sword. Gu Qing Sr. hated Lin Feng from the bottom of his heart.\u201cYou dared kill him.\u201d said Gu Qing Sr. in a voice which sounded like a thunder which made everyone\u2019s heart beat faster.Lin Feng raised his head and looked at Gu Qing Sr. who was in a towering rage. Lin Feng\u2019s pupils were pitch black and he then said: \u201cAre you insinuating that I should have stood here and done nothing and just let him kill me? How stupid are you?\u201dWhen Gu Qing Sr. heard these words, he remained silent. He really wanted Gu Qing Jr. to kill Lin Feng, how could he not allow Lin Feng to kill Gu Qing Jr.? In life, there are such principles as defending one\u2019s own life. Because Gu Qing Jr. was a member of the Gu Clan, he thus wanted Gu Qing Jr. to kill Lin Feng. However, Lin Feng killing Gu Qing Jr, even if it was justified, was still a crime in his eyes.\u201cYou\u2019re very good. You will not live much longer.\u201d said Gu Qing Sr. in an indifferent tone. He had made no attempts to conceal his killing intent. As the crowd heard these words, they felt compassion for Lin Feng. Even though he was extremely strong and had been able to kill one of the most outstanding disciples of the Gu Clan with one strike, there was no chance that the Gu Clan would let him leave alive.\u201cMy name is Duo Ming.\u201d said Lin Feng while looking straight into Gu Qing Sr.\u2019s eyes. He then went down off the stage and his voice echoed throughout the arena as he said: \u201cIf any of your Gu Clan cross paths with me, I will decorate this arena with their heads.\u201d\u201cEeh\u2026\u201dThe crowd was stupefied by Lin Feng\u2019s words. It seemed like he had directly challenged the powerful Gu Clan and spat in their face. He sounded insane, too insane. He had also sounded insufferably arrogant. He was an ordinary young man and he surprisingly dared threaten the large and powerful Gu Clan, he said that he would kill any of them if they found themselves in his path. He was challenging the entire Gu Clan. He was defying all of its members.Obviously, all of the young members of the Gu Clan who heard him burst into an uproar and cursed in rage. However, even though the words coming out of their mouths were fierce, many of them were extremely nervous. They thought that the best thing would be to never cross his path. He had killed Gu Qing Jr with a single effortless strike\u2026 In the Gu Clan, except for those of the Ling Qi layer, they feared that nobody would be able to fight against Lin Feng and return with their head. The best result would be to have Lin Feng fight the stronger members of the Gu Clan, like Gu Yan, that way, he would be able to avenge Gu Qing Jr.\u2019s death.They had no doubts when it came to Gu Yan\u2019s strength. He was a cultivator of the Ling Qi layer. Lin Feng would never be able to compete with him even if he was extremely strong.\u201cIf I come across him, his death will be tragic and brutal.\u201d said Gu Yan standing amongst the other members of the Gu Clan while looking at Lin Feng with ice cold murderous intentions in his eyes. He would kill him and torture him to regain the clans face.The first round hadn\u2019t taken a lot of time and now it had come to an end. There were twenty people left within the tournament. There would be two more fights on each stage and ten people would be remaining.In This round, Lin Feng wasn\u2019t going against a member of the Gu Clan. He was going to fight against an amazing and outstanding member of the Na Lan Clan: Na Lan Chen.\u201cIf you can fight, then fight, if you don\u2019t feel like fighting, then just surrender.\u201d said Na Lan Feng to Na Lan Chen, as before she was setting herself high above the others in an arrogant way while looking at the Northern Stage.\u201cAlright.\u201d said Na Lan Chen while nodding but he was eager to test his strength. Even though he wasn\u2019t as famous and popular as Gu Qing Jr., he was also at the ninth Qi layer, he thought that Gu Qing Jr.\u2019s reputation was undeserved. He thought that because Gu Qing Jr. had underestimated Lin Feng, he had caused his own death to be so swift. This time, Na Lan Chen was definitely going to defeat Lin Feng and make himself famous and gain the status and respect that came with it.Lin Feng, whose face was still under his mask, was looking at Na Lan Feng with a ice cold glare. If they could fight then fight, otherwise just surrender? What was that supposed to mean? Lin Feng hadn\u2019t forgotten what had happened on that night when the Na Lan Clan had sent their clan members to chase and kill him. All of that had happened only because he had refused to allow Na Lan Feng to sit down on his table.\u201cI will use all my strength in this battle. I will make you lose. I will show everyone how prestigious and powerful my clan is compared to others.\u201d said Na Lan Chen while staring at Lin Feng and getting prepared to fight.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s start quickly then.\u201d said Lin Feng while smiling coldly. He wanted to see how powerful and prestigious the Na Lan Clan really was.\u201cDivine Arm spirit.\u201dEven though Na Lan Chen wanted to protect the Na Lan Clan reputation and make it even more famous, he still didn\u2019t dare go easy on Lin Feng. Therefore, he released his spirit. Behind him had appeared a thick and muscular arm spirit, reaching towards the sky as if it wanted to climb its way to the heavens.\u201cOnly those who are directly blood related to the Na Lan\u2019s possess that Divine Arm spirit. How majestic!\u201d\u201cIt is said that the Divine Arm Spirit can give its owner the strength of a god. How could one defeat the possessor of such a powerful spirit?\u201d\u201cOne punch and his opponent will be killed.\u201dBecause he had released his Divine Arm Spirit, Na Lan Chen was extremely confident and carried out a ruthless surprise attack towards Lin Feng.\u201cDivine Punch!\u201dNa Lan Chen shouted. His punch hadn\u2019t reached its destination yet but aura surrounding the fist was breaking through the air and shattering the atmosphere. It was clearly a elemental force.\u201cHow powerful! So that is the strength of that Divine Arm Spirit which can only be possessed only by members of the Na Lan Clan.\u201d\u201cNot only is Na Lan Chen already at the ninth Qi layer but he can already use elemental forces\u2026\u201dThe whole crowd was stupefied. Lin Feng was surrounded by the strong Qi contained within the punch and the air was distorting around him. The shadow of a fist had filled the entire sky.\u201cYou want to die.\u201d Lin Feng said. A cold silver light flashed through the air. Brilliant rays of light filled the atmosphere. With only one strike the gigantic fist shadow had completely disappeared without trace. There was only the resplendent light of Lin Feng\u2019s sword which at this moment looked glorious.Na Lan Chen\u2019s facial expression had changed. He didn\u2019t stop releasing punches which made him step back each time. He had prepared a chain of strikes incase his first strike had failed.\u201cDie.\u201dLin Feng said only one word and Na Lan Chen felt like his heart had been stabbed. A overpowering light suddenly burst out from the sword, it burst through the atmosphere and then penetrated deeply into Na Lan Chen\u2019s throat. His body was sent flying backwards, his body landed heavily on the ground and his head was only attached by a small amount of flesh, there was a huge hole through his neck. His eyes were open wide and were filled with complete shock.The Divine Arm Spirit of the Na Lan Clan\u2019s was able to accomplish great miracles.. but Lin Feng\u2019s sword was also able to accomplish great things.\u201cThe sword strike is strong, but its user is terrifyingly strong.\u201dWhen the crowd saw Na Lan Chen\u2019s body collapse, they felt chills running down their spines and they were staring blankly at Lin Feng. As before, one strike had been enough to kill his opponent.Na Lan Xiong, the head of the Na Lan Clan, was also seized with terror and was rigidly staring at Lin Feng.\u201cYou are damn brave. You surprisingly dared to kill a member of the Na Lan Clan.\u201d After a moment of hesitation, Na Lan Feng shouted those words extremely loudly and angrily towards Lin Feng.Lin Feng raised his head and looked at Na Lan Feng. Then, he smiled coldly and said: \u201cI understand your rules now, Na Lan Clan members are allowed to kill others but others are not allowed to kill members of your clan. You\u2019re really beyond shameless.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Na Lan Feng said furiously and then stopped herself. She didn\u2019t know if she should reply. \u201dJust wait until you fight against me.\u201d said Na Lan Feng looking glum. Her beautiful eyes were filled with killing intent.Lin Feng ignored Na Lan Feng\u2019s remark, immediately turned around and came down off the stage. He didn\u2019t feel like speaking useless words to children.\u201cDuo Ming\u2026 he looks like a conqueror when he uses his sword.\u201dEverybody was looking at Lin Feng and sighed with jealousy. Only a fearless or an extremely brave person would dare to provoke Lin Feng again. Those who hadn\u2019t been eliminated yet also looked concerned. They were all sighing and hoping that they wouldn\u2019t have to fight against that him. That would be the best possible scenario for them. That guy was able to kill with one swift strike and when fighting against him, there was absolutely no chance to surrender the fight before he attacked.The second round came to an end very quickly and only ten people were left. Ten people left, five stages. Another round would be enough.\u201cHave a quick rest and then we\u2019ll continue with the third round.\u201d announced the old man who had stepped on the stage.The crowd was slightly disappointed. They couldn\u2019t wait to watch the next battles. There were ten people left. All the clans had their main representatives in the remaining disciples. The Lin Clan still had two participants. Against all expectations, the Gu Clan only had one person left. Those who were left were the strongest within the tournament. However all eyes were fixed on the masked disciple, Lin Feng.\u201cThis round should be amazing considering the strength of those left.\u201d\u201cIt is very clear how strong they are. Na Lan Feng, Lin Qian as well as Wen Jiang should be the three strongest. Then there should be Gu Yan of the Gu Clan and Qiu Lan. Then, there is Lin Hong of the Lin Clan who has already broken through to the Ling Qi layer. As far as the extremely strong yet arrogant Duo Ming, those who haven\u2019t broken through to the Ling Qi layer shouldn\u2019t be able to defeat him.\u201d\u201cIf he\u2019s lucky, he should be ranked seventh. If he\u2019s lucky, he should be able to move on to the next round.\u201dThe crowd was discussing the upcoming rankings. Everybody else nodded showing that they agreed with the previous statements. These should be quite accurate predictions. If Duo Ming managed to be ranked directly after those who had reached the Ling Qi layer, that would be beyond extraordinary.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I should release the next one within an hour. I took a small\u2026.not so small\u2026kinda long break earlier. lol Tiredness is kicking in, so I need to finish them quickly!!! 3 more to goEnjoy xoxoxThe break was a short one to allow the final 10 to regain their composure from the last battles. None of them had any substantial injuries from the previous fights. The old man declared the beginning of the third round. The crowd was burning with enthusiasm at the upcoming battles.Amongst the ten people qualified for this round, six of them were at the Ling Qi layer. Duo Ming couldn\u2019t be as strong as them but was still extremely strong. There were only three people in whom the crowd wasn\u2019t very interested. Thus, most of the fights were going to be fascinating. This was going to be an entertaining show. There were some stages which strongly attracted people\u2019s attention. On one of them, two participants of the Ling Qi layer were going to fight: Qiu Lan against Lin Hong. The other battle which drew people\u2019s attention was Gu Yan against Duo Ming.The other three battles were not that interesting. Na Lan Feng, Lin Qian as well as Wen Jiang could immediately conclude and move on to the next round. The predictions of the crowd were almost completely accurate. Those facing Na Lan Feng and Lin Qian had immediately given up. Wen Jiang had been fighting against Feng Qian. Even though Feng Qian had fought with all his strength, Wen Jiang had easily won the battle after three hits. Feng Qian had been blown off the stage with an explosive force. Wen Jiang hadn\u2019t even used all his strength to deal with Feng Qian. The difference between a cultivator of the Ling Qi layer and one of the Qi layer was too big; if they fought, the result was usually obvious.At this moment, the crowd was currently paying attention to the fight between Qiu Lan and Lin Hong. They were both followed with great interest by the crowd and the victor of this battle was not clear.On the Northern Stage, Gu Yan was looking at Lin Feng with an ice cold look and killing intent had completely filled his eyes. He had a murderous look and a evil grin on his face. What a stroke of luck! He had eventually been chosen to fight against Lin Feng. If Lin Feng didn\u2019t give up, Gu Yan would kill him and avenge Gu Qing Jr.\u2019s death. He hated Lin Feng so much that he could feel it in his bones.\u201cIf you are too scared to fight, then hurry up and get lost. Don\u2019t make us respectable cultivators, lose face.\u201d said Gu Yan looking at Lin Feng with a mocking gaze. Lin Feng, as usual, was standing there calm and quiet.Then he said in a cold and detached tone: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to try and provoke me into a fight with you. Don\u2019t worry, I was never planning to run away from you.\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201d When Gu Yan heard Lin Feng\u2019s words, he laughed demonically. He had managed to make Lin Feng angry enough to fight and had made sure he would not surrender without giving Gu Yan his revenge. He wouldn\u2019t have thought that Lin Feng would actually accept his challenge so easily.\u201cHow ignorant. I will teach you what it means to have broken through to the Ling Qi layer. There is a huge difference between me and you.\u201d thought Gu Yan while smiling coldly. He didn\u2019t even release his spirit because it might scare Lin Feng away and make him surrender the fight.Immediately after, Gu Yan started walking slowly towards Lin Feng. At that moment, about ten steps were separating Lin Feng and him when he suddenly started moving his hand. An extremely strong explosion spread through the atmosphere in Lin Feng\u2019s direction. An amazingly intense energy was blocking the sky and covering the earth to the extent it was impossible to see Lin Feng at the moment.\u201cYou will die for having dared to provoke me and the members of my clan.\u201d shouted Gu Yan.A second wave of intense power was moving towards Lin Feng. Even if Lin Feng couldn\u2019t endure the first attack, he would kill Lin Feng no matter what. He wanted to kill Lin Feng more than anything. He would not allow Lin Feng to leave this arena alive. Otherwise, he, the best young disciple of the Gu Clan, would lose face and it would be a humiliation for the Gu Clan.At the moment when his powerful attack was going to crash onto Lin Feng\u2019s body, Gu Yan was already grinning with a cruel smile and was patiently awaiting the screams of pain. However, at that moment, the same resplendent light as before radiated in the atmosphere and filled the whole sky. The energy of Gu Yan\u2019s attack started looking like it was being torn apart like paper. It was growing weaker and seemed like it was going to vanish at any moment.\u201cDie.\u201d shouted Gu Yan loudly looking unaffected. He moved his hand and immediately added some force into the previous wave that seemed like it was going to collapse. The attack that he unleashed had looked like it could topple the mountains and overturn seas. This attack was more than enough to kill an opponent who had broken through to the Ling Qi layer.\u201cI REFUSE.\u201d\u201cBOOOM!!!!.\u201dThe voice who which loudly said \u201cI REFUSE\u201d sounded calm and indifferent. A sword Qi suddenly emerged and it looked like it could pierce the heavens themselves. Gu Yan\u2019s energy shattered into tiny pieces. His Qi had completely vanished. There was only the light of the sword which seemed to be standing above everything within the Universe.\u201cLing Qi layer!\u201d said Gu Yan looking deathly pale. How could he have not anticipated that Lin Feng could have been hiding his actual strength? He was too arrogant and conceited.The sword looked desolate and it smelt like death. It was emanating a piercingly cold Qi which seemed to have an unstoppable destructive power. That sword user was conquering everything that laid in his path. His power couldn\u2019t be stopped.The sword suddenly slashed out with incredible destructive power. It felt like it was consuming everything around it.\u201cNot good!\u201d\u201d shouted Gu Qing Sr. who had turned pale with fright. He stood up but it seemed like it was too late already. Gu Yan had been saying he would kill Lin Feng in one hit all along. His quick surprise attack hadn\u2019t even given him a small advantage. At that moment, he was unable to counterattack and was even more unable to block the sword attack.\u201cSWISH\u201dA stream of blood spilled out from Gu Yan\u2019s throat. Gu Yan, who had reached the Ling Qi layer, fell lifelessly onto the floor, his head rolling across the floor of the arena. This was also the first time that a cultivator of the Ling Qi layer had died so far during the tournament. He had died in a single strike.At that moment, all the members of the Gu Clan stood up. They were looking at Lin Feng in despair. They were shaking with anger and fear. The sight of their clans bright future lying headless on the floor of the stage made them feel desperate.\u201cI WILL KILL YOU!!!\u201d shouted Gu Qing Sr. so loudly that it hurt people\u2019s ears.Na Lan Xiong frowned and said: \u201cHead of the Gu Clan, how dare you? Have you forgotten that this is a tournament which was organized by the Na Lan Clan?\u201dGu Qing Sr. looked at Na Lan Xiong completely shocked. He did not think anyone would stand in his way of removing an insignificant bug. He eventually groaned in dissatisfaction and sat down. However, from the way Gu Qing Sr. was looking at Lin Feng, it was obvious that he was never going to let him off.\u201cWhat? Gu Yan died. Like the other before in a single strike?\u201d many people who were initially watching the fight between Qiu Lan and Lin Hong were astonished. Na Lan Xiong and Gu Qing Sr. had drawn their attention when shouting. When they saw Gu Yan\u2019s head which had been separated from his body, they turned pale.Many people were regretting that they had missed such a wonderful battle. They hadn\u2019t thought that the battle would turn out to be that interesting and that a young disciple of the Ling Qi layer would actually get killed, especially by an extremely strong and mysterious young man called Duo Ming.\u201cAll of us have made an error of judgement. Duo Ming has also broken through to the Ling Qi layer.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s incredibly strong. His strength enables him to move on to the next round.\u201dNot only the crowd thought that but Na Lan Xiong while looking at Lin Feng\u2019s back who was getting down off the stage had a similar thought. This young man could defeat cultivators of the Qi layer in a single strike with his sword but he could also defeat cultivators of the Ling Qi layer in one hit\u2026 He is terrifyingly strong. Nobody had realized his potential before. At that moment, the other battle had also finished and was won by Qiu Lan. She had won against Lin Hong. At that point, all those selected to continue to the next round were known. Na Lan Feng, Lin Qian, Wen Jiang, Qiu Lan and Duo Ming!The two who did not belong to a powerful clan had won again: Qiu Lan and Duo Ming. The Gu Clan had no participant anymore and their top two disciples had been beheaded by Lin Feng.The old man announced a short break again. \u201dFourth round, Lin Qian can wait, Na Lan Feng will fight against Wen Jiang and Qiu Lan will fight against Duo Ming.\u201d The crowd was really excited. The last battles were finally going to start. Na Lan Feng\u2019s strength was obviously incredible. Wen Jiang however, was even stronger than Na Lan Feng and Lin Qian as he had already broken through to the second Ling Qi layer. These battles were going to be very exciting. There was also that incredibly strong Duo Ming who had killed three people with a single strike. His battle against Qiu Lan was probably going to be the same sort of battle. Now that the strongest disciples had been decided, the battles would now take place on the main stage.The first battle was going to be between Na Lan Feng and Wen Jiang. \u201dWen Jiang, you are quite strong but as before, you will not fight against me.\u201d said Na Lan Feng in an extremely arrogant way, sounding like a royalty talking down to a servant, showing disdain for everything and everyone.\u201cHA, I broke through to the second Ling Qi layer\u2026 you are only at the first Ling Qi layer, you should be the one giving up.\u201d Wen Jiang said contradicting her.\u201cWhat a moron!\u201d shouted Na Lan Feng while releasing her spirit. Immediately after, her Divine Arm Spirit had appeared behind her back. The most shocking thing was that her Divine Arm Spirit slightly differed from that of Na Lan Chen who had been killed by Lin Feng. Her Divine Arm Spirit was gold. It looked like the gold light radiating from the arm couldn\u2019t be stopped by anything.\u201cOnly a golden Divine Arm Spirit can be regarded as a perfect Divine Arm Spirit.\u201d Said Na Lan Xiong while smiling.In a hundred years, Na Lan Feng was the only one to have a golden Divine Arm Spirit when her spirit was awakened.\u201cShe definitely deserves to be called the Princess of Yangzhou City. She has a golden Divine Arm Spirit and it looks so strong and powerful.\u201d The crowd was shivering and was moved by the Princess at the same time. Wen Jiang thought that losing was not an option and released his spirit as well. On his back appeared a Great River spirit. Great waves were unceasingly flowing with a crashing sound. That was the spirit of the Wen Clan: the Great River spirit.\u201cIn this world, nothing can be considered bizarre, really.\u201d sighed Lin Feng while looking at the spirits released by the fighters. An arm can become a spirit\u2026 and on top of that it can be gold. Rivers could also be spirits\u2026 The number of different spirits which existed was unimaginable. Nobody could imagine how many there were. Anything could become a spirit in this world.Lin Feng was looking at Lin Qian. If his predictions were right, Na Lan Feng would win that battle and would then wait during the next round which would mean that after winning against Qiu Lan, he would battle against Lin Qian.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was because of her overpowering spirit.Since the very beginning, Na Lan Feng had only used one skill: Divine Punch. But in comparison with that of Na Lan Chen, Na Lan Feng\u2019s skills were infinitely more powerful. Her force had a earth shattering power and each strike was extremely heavy. Each time Na Lan Feng carried out an attack, it made Wen Jiang step back a few meters. At some point, he had been shaking so much from receiving the strike that he could not defend and the following strike had severely injured him so he could no longer fight, he had no choice but to give up.\u201cNa Lan Feng is so strong. She\u2019s the Na Lan Clan\u2019s princess\u2026 It\u2019s not surprising that she\u2019s extraordinary. Nobody can compete with her.\u201d Many people were filled with emotion when they saw how strong and beautiful Na Lan Feng was, they had the feeling that she was invincible. They were filled with admiration and worship. Not only was Na Lan Feng extremely beautiful but she was also extremely talented. Many people wished they had the same innate gifts as Na Lan Feng. They were very excited to see how she would develop and what other powers she would show in the future.The second battle was about to begin. Lin Feng was going to fight against Qiu Lan. The crowd could no longer contain their excitement and many were cheering. Even though the battle was probably not going to be as spectacular as the one they had just watched, it should also be quite intense. Besides, they didn\u2019t know how strong Duo Ming really was and were wondering if he could really defeat Qiu Lan. Lin Feng and Qiu Lan were looking at each other and Qiu Lan had a smile on her face. \u201dI do not need to fight any longer in this tournament, I surrender this battle.\u201dThe crowd was astonished when they heard the word \u201csurrender\u201d. Qiu Lan had played a role in the organization of the annual tournament, she had contributed in selecting who would join and now that she had to fight Duo Ming, she had given up\u2026?\u201cCould it be that Duo Ming and Qiu Lan have already fought before and that Qiu Lan knows that she can\u2019t defeat Duo Ming?\u201d wondered the whole crowd lost in confusion. They were trying to guess what was really going on as they really couldn\u2019t clearly understand the situation in front of their eyes.\u201cAlright, nothing can be done. Lets move to the next battle.\u201d said the old man indifferently.\u201cFor the last battle, the three remaining participants will step onto the main stage. The last one remaining on stage will be the winner.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Feng was stupefied. He had thought that the old man would make him and Lin Qian fight first and that there then would be a final battle. He wouldn\u2019t have thought that all of them would be fighting each other at the same time in a free-for-all fight. But as before, Lin Feng went back onto the main stage and walked towards the other participants: Na La Feng and Lin Qian, who had just come up onto the main stage as well.\u201cPhewwww\u2026 this decisive battle. Let\u2019s try and guess who is going to win.\u201d\u201cIt should be Na Lan Feng. She\u2019s extremely powerful and has a Golden Divine Arm spirit. She\u2019s almost invincible. Lin Qian and Duo Ming shouldn\u2019t be able to compete with her.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think. Lin Qian hasn\u2019t used all her strength, so it is impossible to judge. She hasn\u2019t even released her spirit yet. Do you know even what spirit Lin Qian possesses?\u201d\u201cI agree, with her Universal ice and fire spirit. She\u2019s incredibly strong. I actually think that the one who has the biggest potential to win is Lin Qian.\u201dEverybody was giving their own opinion about who was going to win or lose. All of them thought that either Lin Qian or Na Lan Feng would win. Nobody thought Lin Feng had a chance to win. Even if Lin Feng was now regarded as being extremely strong, the crowd still thought that there were only two people who had a chance to win within the three remaining participants.Two amazing yet arrogant female Cultivators from Yangzhou City: Na Lan Feng and Lin Qian. The contrast between them and the strange masked young boy was too great for anyone to attach any importance to him. The three participants were on the stage, each of them standing in one corner of the stage but Na Lan Feng was staring at Lin Qian since the beginning. Lin Qian was also continuously staring at Na Lan Feng. They were staring at each other as if they were fighting a one-on-one battle. It seemed like they had forgotten about Lin Feng. Lin Feng looked at the two girls and smiled deep in his heart. They both wanted to kill him but at that moment, they didn\u2019t even know his real identity and were completely ignoring him.\u201cNa Lan Feng, you will regret what you made me go through on that night. And you, Lin Qian, you made me and my father leave the clan, you wanted to kill me and my dad\u2026 The time for revenge is slowly approaching.\u201d thought Lin Feng. In that cold and cruel world, Lin Feng particularly appreciated and cherished the tenderness and affection that he received any hostility would also be engraved in his memories. In this world, one could only rely on themselves.After a while, Na Lan Feng\u2019s attention was finally drawn away from Lin Qian. She had an arrogant smile on her face. \u201dYou\u2019re quite strong, if you wish, you can join my clan, the Na Lan Clan. Concerning everything that you just did, well, I could forget everything. Besides, I can also personally help you practice cultivation once in a while.\u201d Na Lan Feng had a huge smile on her face. She unconsciously looked utterly arrogant, she didn\u2019t do it on purpose, but could not hide the arrogance which had been engraved into her soul. Concerning the thing that had happened a moment ago and that she could forgive, she was obviously talking about the fact that Lin Feng had killed Na Lan Chen.\u201cYou\u2026 want to help me practice cultivation?\u201d murmured Lin Feng. The girl, who thought she was the best in the world, wasn\u2019t only half arrogant, she was really completely arrogant down to the last fibre of her being, as expected.\u201cIndeed, I, personally, can help you practice cultivation.\u201d said Na Lan Feng who didn\u2019t know what Lin Feng really meant. She even thought that Lin Feng felt extremely honored. She was still smiling and said: \u201cyou have to understand that this is a once in a life opportunity. This usually never happens in the Na Lan Clan. You really are lucky.\u201d Actually, Na Lan Feng\u2019s proposition was really attractive to ordinary people, many ordinary cultivators would have dreamt of being offered such an opportunity. Besides, she, herself, was really attractive and her smile was terribly sexy. However this was not a tournament for normal people, which showed just how arrogant she actually was.\u201cThat would be a dream if it happened to me\u2026 even if I had that dream, I would be smiling even after waking up\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Princess Na Lan\u2026 personally\u2026\u201dMany people in the crowd envied Lin Feng so much and were looking on with envious eyes. He was really incredibly lucky. Could the audience which was filled with ordinary people really be the judge? \u2026 did Lin Feng even need Na Lan Feng\u2019s help to practice Cultivation? It was like she was offering him coal and saying it was a diamond.\u201cHmm, should I feel extremely flattered?\u201d asked Lin Feng in a joking and teasing tone. Because of Lin Feng\u2019s mask, Na Lan Feng was unable to see his facial expression. However, the tone of his voice had changed in comparison with before.\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you feel that way?\u201d asked Na Lan Feng now feeling indifferent with a smaller smile on her face than before. Lin Feng remained silent for a moment. She was as arrogant and conceited as before, she was the best in the world when it came to arrogance.\u201cHahahaha, Na Lan Feng, I would have never thought that you were truly so incredibly stupid. I really don\u2019t understand what help or advice, someone as stupid as you, can give me on the path of cultivation.\u201dAt that moment, laughter sounded from within the crowd. Then, a figure shot through the crowd, it flew like a legendary bird and immediately landed on the main stage. This person looked extremely arrogant. It was a young man who looked incredibly majestic and unreachable. His face was very thin. He radiated arrogance from head to toe.\u201cBai Yuan Hao.\u201d Na Lan Feng said while looking surprised. She narrowed her eyes as she hadn\u2019t expected him to come.\u201cIndeed.\u201d said the young man while looking at Na Lan Feng. He was looking at her with a smile on his face. \u201cNa Lan Feng, in the Imperial City, you are an ordinary person, nothing more. I would have never thought that you called yourself a princess in Yangzhou City. You are so arrogant and top of that seem to be so incredibly satisfied with yourself. You\u2019re such a cheap maid.\u201d\u201cSHUT THE HELL UP.\u201d Na Lan Feng shouted extremely aggressively in an ice cold tone.\u201cHuh? Are you getting angry because I called you a cheap maid? So it must be true that you\u2019re convinced that you are a real princess\u2026\u201d that young man didn\u2019t even give her a glance and continued to grin.\u201cWell, you\u2019re just a worthless dog as well, nothing more.\u201d said Na Lan Feng in a cold tone trying to humiliate him.\u201cBy telling me this, are you admitting the fact that you\u2019re a cheap maid?\u201d said the young man while laughing making Na Lan Feng\u2019s go rigid with anger. She didn\u2019t look beautiful at all at that moment.\u201cShut up!\u201d shouted Na Lan Feng flying into a rage out of humiliation. When they heard that conversation, the crowd was quite confused. The Yangzhou City\u2019s Princess, who was so popular and whose reputation was amazing, was being called a cheap maid by a random person? That young man who had just come out was obviously a nobody talking nonsense.\u201cHow audacious, you actually dared to come to the tournament which is organized by my clan, the Na Lan Clan and conduct yourself in such an disrespectful way. You really want to die.\u201d said Na Lan Xion while staring at that young man furious.\u201cShut up you scum.\u201d said the young man while turning around. He then looked at Na Lan Xiong looking furious and said: \u201cYou are the head of the Na Lan Clan, nothing more, and you dare boast shamelessly. Let me tell you, if I wish, I can make your entire clan disappear like fire under water.\u201d\u201cGrrrrr\u2026\u201d Na Lan Xiong was so furious and enraged that he was going insane. He wouldn\u2019t have thought that that man would be so insolent. The crowd was extremely confused and didn\u2019t understand anything that had happened. They were wondering who that young man who had just appeared really was. He seemed to be even more arrogant than Na Lan Feng or Lin Qian. He even dared to threaten the head of the Na Lan Clan and insult him.\u201cAlright. Alright. I, Na Lan Xiong, would like to see how you intend to make my clan, the Na Lan Clan, disappear.\u201d said Na Lan Xiong who was smiling and no longer looked furious. It was the first time in Yangzhou City that someone dared talk to him that way. That guy was boundlessly wild and arrogant.\u201cFather, can you let me, your daughter, solve that problem myself?\u201d Na Lan Feng had suddenly asked her father that question which left Na Lan Xiong stunned. He was at that moment shaking in fear\u2026 Na Lan Feng meant that\u2026\u201cBai Yuan Hao, why are you not in the Imperial City and why did you come to Yangzhou City?\u201d\u201cI came to ask for the repayment of a debt.\u201d said Bai Yuan Hao while smiling. Immediately after, he looked at Lin Feng and said: \u201cAlright, you, come down.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Feng frowned. Bai Yuan Hao was ordering him to come down as if he was Lin Feng\u2019s superior.Lin Feng looked at Bai Yuan Hao and didn\u2019t move. Bai Yuan Hao frowned and said in an ice cold tone: \u201cGet the hell down now, come down off that stage immediately!\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Who exactly do you think you are by ordering me to come down like that?\u201d said Lin Feng in a tone filled with disdain.The crowd started to think that everyone was becoming even more crazier than the last person. They were so crazy, they suited each other perfectly. Lin Feng wasn\u2019t important in these people\u2019s eyes and after all, they still despised him.He wanted to see who despised him and who he could really count on in the end. It would make things much easier for him in the future to know who his real allies and enemies are.\u201cWhat do I intend to do?\u201d said Bai Yuan Hao with an evil smile on his face. He sneered at Lin Feng and said: \u201cI am using you. You are my pet dog, nothing more\u2026 and you dare ask me what I intend to do?\u201d\u201cQiu Lan, there\u2019s nothing great about the people you chose to come. Even though their strength is so-so, they dare to disobey orders.\u201d Qiu Lan made a wry smile and shook her head, then she said: \u201cDuo Ming, you cannot fight against my bro. You should never fight against him. Get down now, ok?\u201d\u201cBro??\u201d the crowd was stupefied. Qiu Lan suddenly called that wild and arrogant young man \u201cbro\u201d.\u201cI just came here to participate in the annual tournament, that\u2019s all. I am under nobody\u2019s control.\u201d said Lin Feng as cold and detached before adding: \u201cWhether I am his opponent or not, you are drawing final conclusions too early.\u201d\u201cHehe, I wouldn\u2019t have thought that in such a small place as Yangzhou City, there would surprisingly be someone who would dare talk to me, Qiu Yuan Hao, that way. really audacious to the extreme.\u201d\u201cQiu Lan, Qiu Yuan Hao, your family name is also Qiu?!\u201d asked Na Lan Xiong standing and looking extremely surprised. \u201dYou guessed right, my family name is also Qiu. Qiu Lan and I were once members of the Qiu Clan in Yangzhou City. One night, you made our clan, the Qiu Clan, disappear, vanish like a fire under water.\u201d Qiu Yuan Hao\u2019s expression was ice cold and was looking at Na Lan Xiong with fury. \u201dThat year, every member of the Qiu Clan was extremely powerful, we had a great many geniuses\u2026 All had extremely strong spirits. It even became the strongest clan of Yangzhou City. Nobody would have ever thought that you, head of the Na Lan Clan, would be so scared just because the Qiu Clan had become so strong. One night, you carried out a surprise attack on the Qiu Clan, slaughtering its members and their families. You almost killed everyone and exterminated our bloodline. That debt of blood, you can\u2019t have forgotten it, right?\u201dThe crowd was shaking in fear. Qiu Yuan Hao and Qiu Lan had belonged to the Qiu Clan in the past. In the crowd, everybody had heard about the Qiu Clan who was extremely powerful and relied on Vital Golden spirits\u2026 The Qiu Clan was like an unstoppable comet, nobody was able to defeat them and they were extremely famous. But one night, it completely disappeared from Yangzhou City without trace. Some people thought that the entire clan had moved to another place. Some other people thought that they had been killed by an unknown enemy. But the crowd would have never thought that the Qiu Clan had been annihilated by the Na Lan Clan. They had not only slaughtered them but also destroyed the evidence extremely well.Na Lan Xiong\u2019s heart was pounding. He was filled with rage and fury. Killing intent was making his eyes glow, He had never thought that there were survivors of the Qiu Clan.\u201cWhat? You want to silence witnesses by killing them?\u201d said Qiu Yuan Hao with an evil smile on his face before adding: \u201cNa Lan Xiong, I advise you not to get too excited. Your clan, the Na Lan Clan, will not continue to exist for a long time. Wait for me to come and get my revenge. Wait for me to annihilate your clan. Tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow, the name of your clan will not exist anymore in Yangzhou City.\u201d\u201cIs that so? I would like to see how you are going to make us, the Na Lan Clan, disappear.\u201d said Na Lan Xiong while smiling coldly.\u201cFather!\u201d At that moment, Na Lan Feng said again. She was looking at her father while shaking her head which made everyone stupefied. It seemed like Qiu Yuan Hao\u2019s words were not lies. He probably had a huge force behind him to back him up. Otherwise, Na Lan Feng would not over cautious like that. She seemed to be scared of them.\u201cBai Yuan Hao, I don\u2019t believe that you would ever touch me.\u201d said Na Lan Feng in a cold tone.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare kill you, but I definitely will dare humiliate you. Today, I came to Yangzhou in order to make my clan, the Qiu Clan, shine again, and to make people understand how filthy and evil your clan is. Your clan is disgusting. Wait and see, someday, I will come back to Yangzhou City, that will be the day when your clan disappears. Qiu Yuan sounded proud of himself and said: \u201cAlright, you three continue your childish thing\u2026 the geniuses of Yangzhou City, haha, how ridiculous, how amusing!\u201d\u201cIf you have enemies, then you should get your revenge. But you shouldn\u2019t use me as a stepping stone.\u201d Lin Feng said while looking at Qiu Yuan Hao and then added: \u201cOnce the tournament finishes, your problems will have nothing to do with me.\u201d\u201cHow stupid and foolish. Who do you think you are? If I, Qiu Yuan Hao, want to kill you, then I will kill you. An insignificant doggy like you still dares to show off. Since you don\u2019t want to close your big mouth, you should stay here forever and make this your grave.\u201d said Qiu Yuan Hao while smiling evilly.\u201cAn insignificant dog? You can kill me if you want to? Truly ignorant\u201d said Lin Feng in an evil tone while shaking his head. Qiu Lan and Qiu Yuan Hao were filled with an intense and deep hatred. He could understand why and where that hatred came from. Therefore, he had showed respect to them but Qiu Yuan Hao thought he was better than everybody else and he continued to insult and trying to humiliate Lin Feng. Since it was this way, Lin Feng had no reason to try and understand him and his hatred or show compassion to him.\u201cYangzhou City geniuses? Today, I want to show to everyone that you are just a bunch of trash.\u201d said Qiu Yuan Hao in an impudent way. He then released his spirit, immediately, his entire body was covered with a magnificent golden light looking like rays of sun light. As the top of the arena was not covered, sunlight was refracting on his spirit which made it look even more majestic. The eyes of the people in the crowd were stunned by this magnificent view. His spirit was even more dazzling than Na Lan Feng\u2019s golden Divine Arm Spirit.\u201cThat\u2019s a real golden spirit, how awesome!\u201d said the crowd amazed. At that moment, Qiu Yuan Hao\u2019s body looked like a gigantic and invulnerable mountain of gold.\u201cNa Lan Feng, you proclaimed yourself as genius, you are extremely arrogant because you possess a golden Divine Arm Spirit, try and have a fight against me.\u201d Qiu Yuan Hao\u2019s long hair was fluttering in the air. His entire body looked was majestic, coupled with the golden aura which had surrounded his body\u2026 The crowd had the feeling the feeling that he was invincible.He stamped heavily on the main stage which made everyone shake. The entire crowd could already see how powerful he looked but being affected by his attack from such a distance had confirmed how powerful he was.\u201cInvincible Golden Body\u201d Qiu Yuan Hao\u2019s Qi was extremely powerful and made an incredibly loud noise. He then punched in the direction of Na Lan Feng and it looked like that punch was going to be fatal. Invincible Golden Body was a skill which Qiu Yuan Hao had accidentally discovered. It was one of the lowest skills of the Xuan category. Besides, coupled with his Golden Body Spirit, it was even more powerful. The power of the attack was truly amazing. Relying on that combination of spirit and technique, Qiu Yuan Hao could kill many cultivators of a similar strength.\u201cDivine Punch.\u201d When Na Lan Feng saw that Qiu Yuan Hao was about to attack, she did the same and started an attack with a loud shout. She didn\u2019t think that her Divine Arm Spirit was going to be much weaker than the spirit of her opponent.\u201cBOOM, BOOM\u2026.\u201dPower versus power. The entire atmosphere was shaking. Between the two golden punches, a splendid Qi appeared and made a whistling sound as it cut through the air. It then turned into a violent hurricane which shot into the atmosphere.\u201cLet me crush you.\u201d The brilliant golden light on Qiu Yuan Hao\u2019s body became even more radiant. An incredible strength emerged all around his fist. Na Lan Feng groaned and was knocked back ten steps. She was now breathing heavily. She was still looking at Qiu Yuan Hao. He still had his cold and arrogant smile on his face. He was breathing normally and there wasn\u2019t a single sign of exhaustion at all. The arrogant and prestigious girl of Yangzhou City couldn\u2019t even withstand a single attack when facing that opponent. She was already exhausted and about to collapse.\u201cThat Divine Punch is strong.\u201d Divine Punch was an extremely powerful attack but Qiu Yuan Hao\u2019s Golden Body spirit hadn\u2019t been defeated yet. It was much stronger and incomparably more powerful. \u201dYou dare call yourself a genius. That kind of foolishness is only possible in a small city like Yangzhou City. Only in such a miserable place, can you play that little game and make a show of authority, that\u2019s all.\u201d Then he turned and looked at Lin Feng and Lin Qian \u201cIt should be the two of you on this stage, I don\u2019t mind teaching you a lesson once, I want you to understand that you have an exaggerated opinion about yourselves. I also wanted to show all these people, these good-for-nothings what kind of people you are and yet dare call yourselves geniuses.\u201dQiu Yuan Hao was extremely arrogant and confident in his power. He thought that every single person in Yangzhou City was a piece of trash, a good-for-nothing. However, he had defeated Na Lan Qiu a single attack so he actually had the right to be that presumptuous and arrogant. \u201dThat young man is really an outstanding talent. He is an authentic genius and extremely powerful.\u201d The crowd was looking at Qiu Yuan Hao as if he was a deity. They thought that his strength was incredible. The person in whom the crowd had faith, miserably lost against Qiu Yuan Hao, what kind of person had such power?In the Continent of the Nine Clouds, everybody only supported strong Cultivators. \u201dWell, what about you? Are you not making a show of authority in Yangzhou City?\u201d At that moment, Lin Feng had said those words as if he had spat them directly into Qiu Yuan Hao\u2019s face, which stupefied everybody in the crowd. He was really audacious, suddenly daring to humiliate Qiu Yuan Hao.Qiu Yuan Hao looked indifferent and even had a teasing expression in his eyes. He then said: \u201cLook at that, how brave. Once again, you\u2019ve been playing the role of my little doggy. This time, I will have mercy on you, I will not kill you. However, as a punishment for your insolence, I will make your life a living hell and destroy that rotten mouth of yours.\u201d\u201cLittle doggy, rotten mouth\u2026 I noticed how rich your vocabulary is. However, I think that you are the one who spends his life being a little doggy.\u201d said Lin Feng while grinning and sneering at Qiu Yuan Hao. Even though Qiu Yuan Hao\u2019s spirit was powerful, his strength was equivalent to that normally reached when at the first Ling Qi layer, otherwise, his punch a moment before wouldn\u2019t have just made Na Lan Feng step back of a few steps.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201d yelled Qiu Yuan Hao. He liked to call other people names but what he hated the most was being called names by other people. His body started glowing in a golden light and he threw himself towards Lin Feng\u2026\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I MADE IT! 8 chapters today!!!!!I hope you all enjoyed it and continue to support the series xoxox bed time for this evil bunny!A golden palm carrying an extremely strong pressure was rushing towards Lin Feng. The crowd could already imagine Lin Feng getting blown away by that palm strike. Na Lan Feng had been defeated by a similar attack, what about Lin Feng?\u201cGet Lost!\u201d\u201d said Lin Feng strictly. The light of his sword was dazzling as it filled the eyes of everyone watching. The resplendent sword light and the golden hand enhanced each other\u2019s beauty. As a result of their collision, a loud sound similar to that of a gong spread throughout the atmosphere.Qiu Yuan Hao\u2019s golden body not only allowed him to carry out formidably strong attacks but also enabled him to greatly enhance his defense. It seemed like he was impervious to spears and swords. Thus, Lin Feng\u2019s sword was unable to hurt him.That was precisely what Qiu Yuan Hao relied on, his defense skills. He relied on them as much as he relied on his arrogance.\u201cHahaha, are you kidding me? You little doggy, you\u2019re just a piece of trash. You\u2019ll never be able to hurt me.\u201d said Qiu Yuan Hao sneering at Lin Feng. His golden light began to once again fill the air. Lin Feng just sensed the colossal oppressing strength against his sword. That strength made his sword shake so much that he almost had it slip from him grasp.\u201cReally?\u201d replied Lin Feng indifferently. If the sword was used quickly, it could never be stopped. It could overrun all fortifications. A sword user could crush and annihilate everything in his path. Nobody could survive a sword that they did not see.There were a myriad of weapon spirits but the sword spirit was one of the strongest and most powerful weapon spirits which existed. Even though Lin Feng didn\u2019t have a sword spirit, his knowledge when it came to swords surpassed that of a great majority of cultivators who had a sword spirit.\u201cSword force.\u201d Lin Feng whispered. His sword was dazzling. Brilliant rays of lights started to consume the atmosphere. An extremely strong Qi was concentrated in the tip of his sword and emitted a loud explosion.\u201cBOOOOOOM!\u201dLin Feng\u2019s sword collided with Qiu Yuan Hao\u2019s spirit again. A sound like tearing paper spread throughout the air. Qiu Yuan Hao\u2019s facial expression immediately changed. He, who was incredibly strong, had had to step back to avoid that powerful sword and could not rely only on his defenses.When Lin Feng saw that Qiu Yuan Hao had stepped back, he put his sword on his shoulder and said while smiling coldly: \u201cYou said that I was unable to hurt you, well then, why did you just step back?\u201dWhen Qiu Yuan Hao heard those words, his face twisted in anger and while staring at Lin Feng, said: \u201cI admit that I underestimated you but I am stronger than you. You\u2019re still a little doggy, no a little chicken who cannot even withstand a single attack.\u201d\u201cYou talk a lot, but everything that leaves your mouth is crap.\u201d Lin Feng said sounding exhausted. \u201cIf being a genius means opening one\u2019s big mouth and stupidly judging other people, then you definitely are a real genius, a true genius, a genius unmatched beneath the heavens\u201d\u201cHow fearless. Duo Ming has been brave in the face of danger this whole time. He has no fear.\u201d When the crowd saw that Lin Feng had made Qiu Yuan Hao step back, their expression was bright. They already regarded Duo Ming as someone great. They used to think that Lin Feng only had a little power, they had underestimated him\u2026 but at that moment, they really thought that he was stronger than Na Lan Feng or Lin Qian.Na Lan Feng and Lin Qian were also watching Lin Feng and started to think very highly of him. They had thought that Lin Feng wasn\u2019t that strong before but at that moment, they realized how ignorant they had been. Actually, Duo Ming was the person to be careful of, he was on a higher level than them both.\u201cEven though we can\u2019t see his face, he\u2019s obviously very young and he\u2019s a real genius. He must have been gifted ever since his birth. If he could join my clan, the Na Lan Clan, that would be a great help.\u201d said Na Lan Feng who really hoped Duo Ming would join her clan. Then, she walked towards Lin Feng and said: \u201cDuo Ming, I admit that I underestimated you. With such strength like yours, my clan, the Na Lan Clan, will really respect you. Please join my clan and support us in the future. Then, you will able to meet me everyday no matter what, wouldn\u2019t that be great for you. Please join?\u201dNa Lan Feng sounded arrogant and self-confident again. She had recovered from her previous emotions. Relying on her natural beauty and feminine charms, she tried to convince Lin Feng to meet her every day. Both would gain a lot from such a relationship. Besides, she was really beautiful so she was convinced that Lin Feng would not refuse her suggestion.\u201cGet lost.\u201dWhat nobody had expected was that Lin Feng had not only rejected Na Lan Feng\u2019s proposition but had also brandished his sword in her direction, which made him look extremely ruthless.Na Lan Feng\u2019s pupils were dilated. She released her Divine Arm Spirit and started her Divine Punch and bombarded his sword.But nothing happened, the long sword didn\u2019t even move a millimeter. Then, a thunderous roar spread throughout the atmosphere carrying an insanely violent and explosive Qi within. It looked beyond terrifying.Na Lan Feng\u2019s expression suddenly changed. She quickly dodged the attack. She was extremely quick.\u201cBOOOM!.\u201dLin Feng thrust out his left hand which was followed by a loud explosive noise. That punch turned into a multitude of fist shadows superposing one another. Each fist shadow was stronger than the last. It looked like he had created a flood of punches.They were moving towards Na Lan Feng at an unimaginable speed.Na Lan Feng groaned. She was blown backwards and looked extremely fragile and weak. She slid backwards to the edge of the main fighting stage. One more step backwards and she would have fallen off.At that moment, the crowd didn\u2019t know what was going on anymore, they were too confused. Lin Feng had astonished them too many times.Each time Lin Feng moved, they found him amazing, but each time, they also realized they had been underestimating him. It seemed like his strength was ever increasing. It looked like they were underestimating him over and over again. Even at that moment, Lin Feng had defeated Na Lan Feng quickly and efficiently.They remembered how they had thought that Na Lan Feng and Lin Qian were definitely going to win this fight and had never put the young man in their eyes. They were thinking that they had been ridiculous and foolish. If Qiu Yuan Hao hadn\u2019t been there, Lin Feng would have deserved to be designated as their grandfather.The crowd were not the only ones to think that way. Na Lan Feng and Lin Qian, but especially Na Lan Feng, thought that they were the only ones who had a chance and were ignoring Lin Feng when the three of them were on the battle stage, getting ready for the final battle. They had almost forgotten that Lin Feng was even there. They had really underestimated him. At that moment, they also realized how ridiculous they had been. They realized by underestimating him, they could have both died beneath his sword.\u201cYou are so strong\u2026 would you please help me practice and improve my cultivation skills\u2026?\u201d said Lin Feng while looking at Na Lan Feng as he was blatantly humiliating her. Lin Feng was filled with indignation and anger because of that arrogant girl\u2019s behavior but what enraged Lin Feng the most was that that girl didn\u2019t respect people\u2026 and she wanted other people to respect her, otherwise why would she send her troops at night to attack the offenders by surprise. Lin Feng couldn\u2019t stand the arrogant and haughty girl.Na Lan Feng was utterly ashamed of herself when she remembered what she had said. She had the feeling she was truly foolish.\u201cJoin your clan, meet you everyday, who do you think you are? You think you are alone at the top of the world, you think others are beneath you. What gives you the right to think that I would ever want to meet you every day?\u201dLin Feng continued to talk and made Na Lan Feng understand how ridiculous she was and that she had no right to be arrogant.Na Lan Feng had the feeling that her face was burning. She couldn\u2019t refute anything that Lin Feng had said.At that moment, Na Lan Xiong was looking at them. He was staring at Lin Feng who was filled with anger and whose expression was ice cold. He had defeated Na Lan Feng so easily. That Duo Ming really looked like he was going to kill the arrogant Na Lan Feng, the greatest disciple of the Na Lan Clan, a real genius.The crowd hadn\u2019t been so excited as at that moment. Lin Qian, Na Lan Feng, Duo Ming as well as Qiu Yuan Hao, all were geniuses, all were stronger than the other.None of them had a strength which could make the crowd despise them, but some of them were so insanely strong that the crowd\u2019s blood was boiling in excitement, for example when looking at Lin Feng.He gradually was showing more and more strength, he was gradually becoming more and more insane. So far, he hadn\u2019t been so furious and enraged as at that moment. The more ruthless he became, the more excited the crowd became. Nobody was even willing to fight against him anymore. He was really hot-blooded and merciless.\u201cOh, you\u2019re still there. I have no intention to fight against you to prevent you from taking your revenge\u2026 but do you think that trying to humiliate me over and over again and thinking that you are the best person in the world makes you an amazing person?\u201dLin Feng had turned around and was looking at Qiu Yuan Hao and then said in an ice cold tone: \u201cYou say that Na Lan Feng is extremely arrogant and sets herself high above everyone else\u2026 that she can act that way only because she is in a small and miserable town like Yangzhou City\u2026 what about you? Are you not acting in the same way? Genius? calling me a little doggy and a chicken\u2026 now, I would like to ask you, what makes you a genius?\u201dLin Feng said that while walking. He released his spirit for the first time.All of them seemed not to have noticed that they had all released their spirit at least once\u2026 but Lin Feng had not released his spirit the whole time.In his eyes, the entire world became darkness. Lin Feng\u2019s eyes became pitch black. He looked truly evil. It looked like he had two black holes instead of eyes. He looked like a demon.Everything around him seemed to slow down. Every movement, every person and their face, every single thing\u2026 Lin Feng could see everything around him at the same time and it was crystal clear as if everything was moving in slow motion. Nothing could escape from Lin Feng\u2019s attention. He knew what everyone was doing at any given time.He could also hear his own heart palpitating. He could even sense his own blood circulating in his veins. He could sense every single movement that Qiu Yuan Hao was making, including his respiration.Lin Feng was unable to speak at that moment though as if he, was an omnipotent deity, as if he was in every single moment at the same time, as if he was a gigantic pair of eyes able to observe every single thing in the universe at the same time\u2026 but eyes couldn\u2019t speak.Through the silver mask that Lin Feng was wearing, Qiu Yuan Hao could see Lin Feng\u2019s eyes. He had begun to tremble with fear, he had never felt so much fear in his life. He couldn\u2019t realize what he was seeing. What was wrong with Lin Feng\u2019s eyes? Why did it seem like he was staring into the eyes of death itself?At that moment, Qiu Yuan Hao was confused and terrified. He could feel the fear penetrating deep into his bones and was shivering like he was frozen. He must be having a hallucination, there was nobody in front of him.Lin Feng was clearly standing in front of him but Qiu Yuan Hao couldn\u2019t feel his presence at all. It was just as if he was closing his eyes and couldn\u2019t see people or sense other people\u2019s presence near him. It was as if the place where Lin Feng stood was a black hole which absorbed his presence.\u201cBOOM!\u201d\u2026.\u201cBOOM!\u201d\u2026\u2026.\u201cBOOM!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026At that moment, the atmosphere was extremely silent. Everybody was staring at Lin Feng as if he was the only person within the universe.Even though Lin Feng\u2019s steps made almost no sound at all, each and every one of his steps caused a terrifying sensation in their hearts, it sounded like their hearts were trying to burst from their chests. This was fear, this was terror. It was a primal instinct, everyone wanted to do only one thing\u2026.Run.With eyes filled with fury, Lin Feng was drawing closer and closer to the frozen Qiu Yuan Hao with every step.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This is my first release of tonight.Also thanks to Readtilltheybleed, he made a very creative comment which I now use for synopsis.Enjoy! xoxoxAt that moment, Lin Feng was shrouded in a mysterious aura of darkness. His steps seemed to be corresponding to some kind of special cosmic rhythm. That cosmic rhythm seemed to follow the same laws as that of elemental forces.The sword could diffuse a strong sword force with each strike\u2026 heaven and earth would also naturally produce a force which filled the world.When Lin Feng released his spirit, he could sense and comprehend things in a way that was shockingly advanced, he could understand the mysteries which confused cultivators who were several realms higher. Millions of thoughts were circulating in his brain at full speed. These thoughts gave Lin Feng strange perceptions and a feeling of understanding a higher realm.\u201cCelestial spirit, transforms me into something unknown and unbelievably strong\u2026.\u201d thought Lin Feng very pleased but it was impossible to see it on his face. Lin Feng\u2019s right hand reached down and begun to remove his belt.\u201cHuh?\u201d the entire crowd was looking at Lin Feng\u2019s movements and could not believe he had just removed his belt. What was he planning to do?\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a sword!\u201d Everybody\u2019s eyes seemed even more shocked that his silver belt had become a sword. They had already seen that Lin Feng was carrying a sword on his shoulder but they hadn\u2019t paid attention to what was around his waist\u2026 Lin Feng seemed to be holding something which resembled a soft and flexible sword.Lin Feng was getting nearer and nearer to Qiu Yuan Hao. At that moment, an extremely strong sword Qi was revolving around Lin Feng\u2019s body. Lin Feng\u2019s body seemed to look like the handle of a sword and the Qi which was emanating from his sword and body had formed a blade like shape in the air above him..\u201cIs that a spirit?\u201d The entire crowd had a strange feeling and didn\u2019t really understand what was going on. Could it be that Lin Fen had a sword spirit? Otherwise, how could he be surrounded by such an insanely strong sword Qi?The crowd seemed to have come to the realization that Lin Feng hadn\u2019t released his spirit at all\u2026 He hadn\u2019t needed to\u2026 he could display a strength above that of the geniuses before them, without releasing his spirit.With each step that he took, the sword force was becoming stronger and stronger. Just by looking at the sword, everyone could tell that the killing force contained was growing with each passing moment. Even though Lin Feng was filled with murderous thoughts and his face was shockingly calm, it also seemed like he was slightly happy.\u201cThe ten thousands things of creation possess a force, it is part of their innermost nature and the sword itself has a force\u2026 why keep using sword Qi when there is unlimited force?\u201dBefore, Lin Feng would need to release a lot of sword Qi to use the sword force but at this moment he was not releasing his own sword Qi, but was using the Sword force and taking the Qi from the sword into his body. He could freely control the force to his will. He could now borrow force whenever he wanted. Therefore, he could unleash as much sword force in a single strike as he pleased. He was no longer limited by his own Qi.His entire body and aura was starting to look like a sword, like an extremely sharp and ruthless sword!Lin Feng, deep in his heart was growing happier and happier. The sword Qi in his body and the atmosphere was also becoming more and more vigorous. However at the same time, Qiu Yuan Hao was growing more and more concerned, a look of fear was covering his face.The whole atmosphere was being consumed by the pressure of the sword force and it felt like the sword was trying to consume him and bathe in his blood. He could only panic, he could sense that Lin Feng was a threat to his life and at any moment his life could end.Lin Feng could really tear through his Golden Body Spirit with such a terrifying sword force.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t wait any longer, I should retreat.\u201d thought Qiu Yuan Hao. His confidence had been crushed by that enormous sword Qi and terrifying sword force. Besides, Lin Feng\u2019s force was showing no signs of decreasing, instead it was still growing stronger. He was scared to approach Lin Feng because he feared that he wouldn\u2019t be able to come out of the encounter with all of his body parts.Qiu Yuan Hao would have never thought that he would end up in such a situation facing a nobody in Yangzhou City. He wasn\u2019t even famous, he was an unknown. On top of that, his sister had invited him to join the annual tournament, so how could he be so strong? Lin Feng at this moment was looking at him as if he was looking at a street mutt.Qiu Yuan Hao decided to start releasing his Qi again, he could not accept such humiliation from a nobody. His golden body was surrounded by a radiant golden light and he began releasing his colossal strength. His entire body was emanating a powerful Qi and he was even using an incredible force.\u201cInvincible Golden Body!\u201dIn an extremely loud shout, Qiu Yuan Hao eventually decided to attack. He coated his fist in his indestructible aura and launched his fist towards Lin Feng.\u201cBOOM!\u201dAs his fist crashed through the air, the sound of explosions filled the air as if he was shattering the atmosphere which restrained his fist.\u201cDie\u201dLin Feng said that word in a low voice and suddenly, an incredibly powerful sword force emerged out of his body and tore the atmosphere apart, then rushed towards Qiu Yuan Hao\u2019s body .The force of the sword made Qiu Yuan Hao\u2019s body distort. Sounds of tearing and ripping could be heard from inside his body. It sounded like his body could be torn apart at any moment.The sword force which was unleashed was accompanied by an extremely powerful Qi. The sword flashed through the atmosphere cutting everything in its path and an extremely dazzling light filled the air.The sword struck against Qiu Yuan Hao\u2019s chest.\u201cCRRRAAAACCK!\u201dQiu Yuan Hao\u2019s body cracked open like an egg as his protective layer shattered into pieces. His spirit was disintegrated. Blood splashed everywhere and Qiu Yuan Hao\u2019s body was launched backwards.It was now clear that he was weaker than Lin Feng. The strong cultivator who had come from the imperial city, same as those who had come before him, had not been able to withstand a single strike carried out by Lin Feng.At that moment, the crowd was astonished, stunned, stupefied and was staring blankly at Lin Feng.How terrifyingly strong. That was pure and undeniable strength. No one was able to deny the power that he had just unleashed.Whether it was a genius or a powerful disciple mattered not, Lin Feng had only needed a single strike to deal with them.\u201cPhewww\u2026. Duo Ming is the real genius today. He was definitely the hero of the day. Nobody could compete with his strength or defy his wrath. That haughty girl actually thought she was worthy of him, but Duo Ming is someone who is favored by the gods.\u201dThe crowd was still staring silently at Lin Feng. He definitely had gained a special esteem and respect within their hearts.\u201cNa Lan Feng considers herself as above the rest of the world, the strongest, the most beautiful\u2026 Surprisingly, she even wants to become a mentor for Duo Ming on the path of cultivation, that brat does not have eyes.\u201d\u201cQiu Yuan Hao is also extremely arrogant and thinks he is invincible. He humiliated and insulted Duo Ming, called him a little doggy. Now, he can\u2019t even withstand a single attack when facing Duo Ming. He is actually the little doggy. He actually thought he could be that arrogant in Duo Ming\u2019s City but he was wrong, he better learn his lesson and behave in Yangzhou City.\u201d\u201cOnly Duo Ming is a true genius. He has received a blessing from the heavens and the earth. He is the most talented and the most powerful person in Yangzhou City.\u201dLin Feng couldn\u2019t know what the crowd was thinking. He was looking at Qiu Yuan Hao lying on the ground. Lin Feng was expressionless. That was the price to pay for humiliating and despising others for no reason.Lin Feng turned around and didn\u2019t look at Qiu Yuan Hao again. The black holes he was using as eyes then turned towards Lin Qian. On that day, Lin Feng was going to use Lin Qian and wipe away all his past humiliations.\u201cIt looks like you and me are the last ones left. Let\u2019s continue.\u201d said Lin Feng showing no emotions, which frightened Lin Qian. She did not know what he intended to do.Her strength was very similar to that of Na Lan Feng. Qiu Yuan Hao had been able to defeat Na Lan Feng with ease.But the strong and powerful Qiu Yuan Hao had not been able to block Lin Feng\u2019s sword which gave Lin Qian the impression that she had no chance to defeat Lin Feng at all.\u201cWho the hell is that guy? Surprisingly he is so strong\u2026\u201d Lin Qian whispered. On that day, her self confidence had been crushed.She used to think that she was amazing because she had reached the first Ling Qi layer. She used to think that she could defeat anyone who was before her. She was a true genius and no one else mattered. Her state of mind was the same as that of Na Lan Feng.Then Qiu Yuan Hao had appeared from nowhere and made her understand that even though she had reached the first Ling Qi layer, there were many others who were still stronger than her and much more talented.But at the moment when she had thought that Qiu Yuan Hao was incredibly strong, Lin Feng had cut him down with a single sword strike. This had made her feel extremely inferior.\u201cI think it\u2019s useless to continue after these events.\u201d said Lin Qian sounding cold and detached. Even though her self confidence had been crushed, she still didn\u2019t want to show it.. She didn\u2019t want to admit that she wanted to surrender.Lin Feng\u2019s pitch black eyes looked like they were smiling. Even at that point, Lin Qian was unwilling to stop acting high and mighty.Moonlight Feather Agility. Lin Feng\u2019s body vanished without trace.\u201cLin Qian, step back!\u201d said someone shouting extremely loudly. Lin Ba Dao was frightened and didn\u2019t want Lin Feng to attack Lin Qian. He had been paying attention all along. When he saw Lin Feng\u2019s move, he immediately warned Lin Qian. At the same time, his body transformed into a whirlwind breaking through the air and moving straight towards the fighting stage.Lin Qian was also aware of the danger and she immediately released her Universal Ice and Fire spirit. Both Ice and fire was coming out of her hands and she threw herself towards Lin Feng whom had appeared in front of her.\u201cBOOOM!\u201dLin Feng blocked the attack, the ice had melted and the fire was extinguished. Immediately after, his body shot towards Lin Qian. He would show no mercy at all, a single sword strike.Lin Feng thrust his sword at Lin Qian.\u201cLet\u2019s see if you dare!\u201d shouted Lin Ba Dao while trying to intervene. A scorching fire was unleashed from the palm of his hand and moved to block Lin Feng\u2019s sword.\u201cBOOOM!\u201dThe fire was unimaginably powerful and had weakened the power of the sword which was about to crash into Lin Qian\u2019s body but the force of the sword still struck her and sent her flying towards the edge of the fighting stage, she was alive but gravely injured.\u201cHow dare you violate the rules of the annual tournament like that?\u201d Lin Feng shouted and then added: \u201cBecause you are worthless, you need to make a spectacle of yourself and need the help of the older generation to back you up, what a disgrace. The Lin Clan has finally shown its true colors. How shameless!!\u201dNa Lan Xiong remained silent. That whole tournament had deviated too much from what he had planned. Since it was this way, he felt like everything right now was meaningless. Lin Feng had injured his daughter, Na Lan Feng, could Na Lan Xiong have mercy on Lin Feng?\u201cHow audacious. Who do you think you are, to be that arrogant?\u201dLin Ba Dao saw that Na Lan Xiong remained silent, he didn\u2019t hesitate at all and tried to slap Lin Feng\u2019s silver mask.Lin Feng didn\u2019t try to avoid the attack. His silver mask directly fell down onto the ground and his real face appeared.\u201cIt\u2019s you\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s you\u2026\u201dLin Ba Dao and Lin Qian said these words at the same time. When they saw Lin Feng\u2019s real face, they were stupefied. They felt like a blizzard was spreading through their veins and an icy cold chill ran down their spines.At the same time, all the members of the Lin Clan in the crowd were stupefied when they saw Lin Feng\u2019s real face. That insanely strong and powerful young man surprisingly is a member of the Lin Clan\u2026 or actually a former member of the Lin Clan who had been expelled for apparently being weak!!!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 - A Fierce TigerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySpecial Thank to Chikezie I &amp; Kevin M for this chapter. This is the second chapter of the day.I did just wake back up, so I am going to try and finish the third one then go to bed. I really need my energy drinks\u2026..but I have to work in the morning \u2026.. ????Please point out any errors that you see, I cannot guarantee my proofreading skills when I have just woken up.Enjoy xoxo\u201cIt\u2019s him. No wonder\u2026 no wonder that he would dare attack me. I sent troops, but he killed them all, now I am next.\u201d Na Lan Feng was extremely surprised. She was shaking from fear as she had sent a large number of people to kill him but he had killed them all, leaving no survivors.When she remembered what had happened at the Whistle Wind Restaurant, Na Lan Feng had a bitter feeling in her heart. What had given her the right to act towards Lin Feng over such petty problems? She was regretting all of her actions to this point. She had created a terrible enemy for herself and her clan.When the crowd saw the expression that the Lin Clan members had, they were surprised. They were confused and were wondering who the mysterious person under the mask was. Who was that guy who made the Lin Clan members so shocked?\u201cImpossible, how did you become this strong?\u201d Lin Qian couldn\u2019t believe what she had witnessed, all that strength that he had displayed. An insanely strong and powerful young man, he was a genius. She would have never considered that he could have strength to fight her, she used to think he was a piece of trash. The feeling she had at this moment was unbearable, if he was really trash then what was she?\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt. Your eyes are correct. I am Lin Feng, the one that you all despise so much, also known as the \u201cpiece of trash\u201d within the Lin Clan.\u201dLin Feng sounded indifferent. His simple answer made the hearts of the Lin Clan members extremely heavy. This young man should have been the glory and pride of the Lin Clan, with him by their side, their future would have been glorious. They should have hailed him as a hero but instead they had ridiculed him and expelled him from the clan. What complete foolishness they all had, they did not deserve such a genius.The crowd was stirring and growing restless. The Lin Clan had abandoned Lin Feng. The rumors said it was a piece of trash who almost died against Lin Hong. Everybody in the Lin Clan despised him. Could this terrifying young man really have needed help from his father against someone so much weaker than himself? The rumors were beginning to sound more and more untrue.What had happened on the stage was shocking. Nobody would have thought Qiu Yuan Hao would appear. They had discovered a genius, but that genius was the one known as a piece of trash according to rumors from the Lin Clan.\u201cNo wonder that he was wearing that silver mask!\u201dMembers of the audience slowly started to understand the chain of events that had occurred and why this mysterious young man had no background.\u201cLin Qian, people as arrogant as you are very rare. You think that you stand at the top of the world, looking down on others. But it is only possible for you to be that way within the Lin Clan, that\u2019s all. Never say that you are a genius because all you are is a foolish little girl. Lin Ba Dao, you are a weak shell of a man compared to my father, you will never be as strong as him. But you acted in collusion with the Honorable Elder to overtake the power and make my father abdicate. On top of that, you wanted to expel him from the clan. You believe in Lin Qian\u2019s power more than anything, thinking that she will someday be the hope for the clan\u201d\u201cBut now, everybody can see that Lin Qian cannot compete with me. She\u2019s a worthless little girl who can only run her mouth. Don\u2019t you feel stupid? Don\u2019t you think you are laughable? Are you not ashamed of yourselves? Don\u2019t you regret what you did? Of course, I understand that you are not going to admit it even if you do regret what you did. However, today is only the beginning. Today I have only proved how stupid, foolish and shameless you all truly are. Your words, your faces\u2026 you are all filthy. Someday I will return with my Father and we will take justice.\u201dSuddenly, Lin Feng had stopped being silent. Every single sentence he had said had penetrated deeply into the hearts of the Lin Clan members. It moved them and shocked them.Lin Feng was right. Every member of the Lin Clan had dared despise Lin Hai and wanted Lin Ba Dao to become the head of the Lin Clan. It wasn\u2019t because Lin Ba Dao was strong though because Lin Ba Dao wasn\u2019t even in the same league as Lin Hai. All of this was because of Lin Qian and her talent. They all looked at her as if she was a deity. They had thought that Lin Qian had limitless power. They had thought that she could make the Lin Clan rise up and that they would all benefit in the future.But they would have never thought that their beloved and cherished Lin Qian could be surpassed by someone else, especially by another genius who had been expelled from the clan. The most bitter thing was that he was the son of the former head of the clan\u2026That was the beginning, nothing more. Lin Feng would become much stronger. He had huge potential and limitless talent. Would Lin Qian ever be able to catch up to him?Why had a genius like him been expelled from the Lin Clan? Why had nobody acknowledged him when he defeated Lin Hong? Why had nobody given him the chance to prove them wrong? Why had they continued to think that Lin Qian was their only hope and raised her above him in every possible way? It wasn\u2019t until this moment that the Lin Clan truly understood the grave mistake that they had made. They had treated a hero, such a rare genius with nothing but disdain, they had brought the hatred of him and his father down upon themselves. Had any of them truly been thinking of the clan?Regret? Of course, the Lin Clan members regretted everything. They knew that nothing could ever turn back time before they had made such mistakes. They had made a big mistake by hurting a genius of Yangzhou City. Even an extremely strong cultivator who had come from the Imperial City wasn\u2019t a match for a single strike from Lin Feng.\u201cYou animal, shut the hell up!\u201d shouted Lin Ba Dao furiously because he couldn\u2019t bear hearing Lin Feng\u2019s words anymore.\u201cLin Ba Dao, you are a worthless clan member. Using my father\u2019s uncle to overtake his power. Your goal was to create confusion within the Lin Clan. You never cared about our family ties, about the same blood flowing in our veins. From the bottom of your heart, all you ever wanted was kill my father and me. Lin Ba Dao, you are not even worth being called an animal yourself, you are nothing but a worm. I am ashamed to think that we share the same blood. Even if I am not part of the Lin Clan anymore, knowing that we share the same blood will always be a disgrace to me. Even if no one ever finds out we share the same blood, knowing this fact makes me sick.\u201dEvery single word Lin Feng had said was like a sharp knife stabbing Lin Ba Dao\u2019s heart.Lin Feng was usually a quiet person, he would never spend long times speaking. He wasn\u2019t an expert when it came to the expression of his feelings and emotions\u2026 but who could ever understand him, he had already lived another life?Lin Ba Dao\u2019s heart was pounding furiously. He could never forgive Lin Feng. He had no regret and could only feel the hatred inside himself.\u201cHead of the Na Lan Clan. Please don\u2019t blame me for interfering in this match.\u201d said Lin Ba Dao while looking at Na Lan Xiong.\u201cThese are your clan\u2019s internal affairs. I obviously have no right to intervene.\u201d replied Na Lan Xiong in an indifferent tone.When he saw them, Lin Feng smiled coldly. He had humiliated and injured Na Lan Feng. Na Lan Xiong already hated him bitterly. But Lin Ba Dao was still scared to be beaten by Na Lan Xiong because he had broken the rules of the tournament.\u201cIn my eyes, this annual tournament is a big fa\u00e7ade. You only want the Na Lan Clan members to win. You can\u2019t stand losing to anyone else. I don\u2019t want to participate in these kind of stupid events again. It\u2019s clear that if a genius injures a member of your clan, you will later send people to attack them by surprise. The Na Lan Clan is a huge joke. Truly shameless.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s black eyes looked ice cold. People were still shocked by Lin Feng\u2019s aura. There was no one that did not have their eyes fixed on Lin Feng after the power he had shown.\u201cLin Qian, didn\u2019t you want to kill me? So now, I will take your life.\u201dLin Feng said that while laughing evilly. He started walking towards Lin Qian. Lin Ba Dao was shaking in anger. He was in front of Lin Qian obstructing the way.\u201cDIE!\u201d shouted Lin Feng demonically. He unsheathed his long sword from his back and moved it in Lin Qian\u2019s direction. Thunderous roars spread throughout the atmosphere.\u201cDo you think you even have a chance?\u201d Lin Ba Dao shouted while looking at Lin Feng who had unsheathed his sword. A strong Qi filled the atmosphere and thunderous roars filled the air.\u201cMoonlight Feather Agility.\u201dLin Feng suddenly vanished but didn\u2019t move towards Lin Ba Dao and Lin Qian, he rather moved to a more distant place.\u201cOh NO!.\u201dNa Lan Xiong turned pale with fright. He stood up. He raised his head and saw Lin Feng above Na Lan Feng\u2019s head as if he was falling from the sky. Lin Feng\u2019s target was Na Lan Feng!!Na Lan Feng also found out that she was Lin Feng\u2019s target and was filled with shock. She saw his eyes filled with darkness moving closer\u2026 she attacked with a Divine Punch, but Lin Feng could use his soft sword with extreme speed. Na Lan Feng\u2019s fist shadow vanished and Lin Feng\u2019s cold sword was pressed against in Na Lan Feng\u2019s throat.\u201cHow dare you!?\u201d shouted Na Lan Xiong short before arriving near Lin Feng.\u201cOne more step and I will kill her\u201d said Lin Feng in an ice cold tone. He looked expressionless. Nobody had any doubt when it came to Lin Feng. If Nan Lan Xiong made one more step, Lin Feng would probably kill Na Lan Feng.Na Lan Feng was looking at Lin Feng\u2019s darkness filled eyes. She had never been in such a situation. In Lin Feng\u2019s black eyes, she was just a worthless little brat. He had taken her as a hostage very easily as if she truly had no strength. At that moment, Na Lan Feng obviously understood that Lin Feng had taken her as a hostage.The crowd was looking at Lin Feng while remaining speechless. That remarkable young man who seemed to be blessed by the god was also extremely reckless and ambitious.Everybody thought he was insane and he surprisingly dared humiliate every clan again and again. The crowd could only stand there in silence as they watched these events.Maybe when they had seen Lin Feng appear for the first time when he had joined the tournament, they already had the feeling that things were not going to go as planned. Even the events with Qiu Yuan Hao were unexpected, Lin Feng however had been insulting all of the powerful clans from the moment he first appeared. He had been offending everyone because of something that happened before the tournament. Na Lan Feng had made a mistake before and it seemed like Lin Feng had already planned to use her to escape.This was a ruthless and insane young man. Only somebody as strong as Lin Feng could be so reckless with his actions. Only someone as insane as Lin Feng could have planned this from the start.His words were mysterious and his actions were insane. He had drawn the attention of the entire crowd.When Lin Ba Dao wanted to take his revenge, Lin Feng had pleasantly surprised the entire crowd with his words, including Na Lan Xiong.Lin Ba Dao and Na Lan Xiong were helpless in front of Lin Feng, who was holding Na Lan Feng as a hostage. They looked like monkeys who were dancing to his tune.Lin Feng was like a fierce tiger, he had completely captured his prey!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Lin Feng was in absolute control.Lin Feng was using his Celestial Spirit and that moment he was able to see everything extremely clearly as if he was looking down on the world frozen in time..The moment when he had released his Celestial Spirit, his brain had started operating at an incredible speed and could solve even the most challenging problems. Everything that was happening around him was instantly processed by his brain and nothing was escaping his attention.Every single word Lin Feng had said fascinated the crowd and drew their attention. Na Lan Xiong and Lin Ba Dao were furious at this turn of events. At the moment when Lin Feng had threatened to kill Lin Qian, he hadn\u2019t killed her and instead had taken Na Lan Feng as a hostage.The most fascinating thing was that even though Lin Feng\u2019s brain was operating at an incredibly terrifying speed, he remained calm and level headed.Lin Feng sighed, his Celestial Spirit had completely changed him as if he had transformed into something no longer human. His spirit enhanced all of his skills and abilities. Besides, that was also only the first layer of the Celestial Spirit. There was also the second layer which could be released used at any time, his Book Spirit.\u201cLet her go.\u201d Na Lan Xiong said with a voice filled with killing intent.\u201cLet her go? Is that even possible?\u201d said Lin Feng while smiling evilly in his heart. As before, his face was expressionless which made him look exceptionally ruthless.\u201cI can guarantee that if anyone tries to get near me or tries to attack me, I swear to you all that the first one to die will not be me.\u201dLin Feng had said these ruthless words with almost no change in his expression, showing no fear. His words felt like a slap in the face. Na Lan Xiong could not help but twist his face in anger.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s soft sword slightly moved. In a flash, a thread of blood appeared on Na Lan Feng\u2019s throat even though the soft sword had only slightly pressed on her throat. Na Lan Feng was terrified when she felt a sharp burst of pain. Lin Feng\u2019s pitch black eyes made her especially terrified. She didn\u2019t believe that Lin Feng would let her go easily once they escaped. His eyes look inhumane and heartless, there were not the eyes of a man but that of a demon. She may truly die at his hands.Na Lan Feng obeyed Lin Feng and started walking towards the exit.\u201cRemember my words.\u201d said Lin Feng while looking at Lin Ba Dao who was very close to him at this moment. Lin Feng once again pressed his sword against Na Lan Feng\u2019s throat and another trace of blood appeared.\u201cStep back.\u201d shouted Na Lan Xiong at Lin Ba Dao who was standing at a strategic point. He could see that Lin Ba Dao was still planning to attack Lin Feng.Na Lan Xiong\u2019s tone made Lin Ba Dao shiver. He hated Na Lan Xiong for standing in his way. He would have never thought that Lin Feng would be so sly and take Na Lan Feng as a hostage. Nobody would dare to confront him, for fear of angering Na Lan Xiong.\u201cLin Feng, if I let you off, will you let my daughter go?\u201d asked Na Lan Xiong with a stern tone.\u201cAre you trying to have me kill her right here and now?\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s black eyes just stared at Na Lan Xiong showing no emotion. Na Lan Xiong felt powerless against facing Lin Feng. He didn\u2019t dare do anything because in Lin Feng\u2019s eyes was pure darkness which made him look incredibly evil. He was scared that Lin Feng would be angered and kill Na Lan Feng.They didn\u2019t talk much longer. Lin Feng and Na Lan Feng gradually disappeared into the horizon. Even if Na Lan Xiong couldn\u2019t do anything, he was still praying that nothing tragic would happen to Na Lan Feng.Finally, the crowd saw Lin Feng\u2019s silhouette disappear into the distance. They could not help but sigh a breath of relief at seeing him leave. They had felt like this was all a chaotic dream. They were all exhausted at the events which had come to pass. Lin Feng had done so many astonishing things. Everyone had more than enough excitement for one day.\u201cLin Feng.\u201d\u201cLin Feng.\u201d\u201cLin Feng.\u201dIn every corner of the city, only one name could be heard. The Na Lan Clan, the Gu Clan, even Qiu Yuan Hao and Qiu Lan, all had just one name in their mind and on their tongue: \u201cLin Feng.\u201dLin Clan members all seemed to carry a look of regret and deep thought on their faces. Lin Feng was a prodigy who had once belonged to the Lin Clan but when he had revealed his power and become known as a great talent, the glory wasn\u2019t attributed to the Lin Clan. Actually, it was the opposite, they were going to suffer from harsh criticism. A talented young man who was once a member of the Lin Clan had been expelled from the Clan for being weak. How could they have been so stupid?No matter what, after the battles of that day, Lin Feng had already gained an incredible reputation within Yangzhou City.Very quickly, people in Yangzhou City would all hear the name, Lin Feng. The former piece of trash of the Lin Clan had become a genius who had received the blessing of heaven and earth, however he was stupidly thrown away by the Lin Clan.Lin Feng obviously didn\u2019t think about that and didn\u2019t really care. All he wanted was to leave Yangzhou City. He didn\u2019t know when he would go back to Yangzhou City. He only knew that when he would go back there, people would respect him and acknowledge his power. There would be nobody who would dare disrespect or despise him. He wouldn\u2019t need to rely on a hostage next time. He would come and go freely as he pleased.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Ten days later, Lin Feng had arrived at the Yun Hai Sect on Qian Li Xue. gazing at the mountains where the Precipice of the Abyss was situated. He could not help but remember fond memories.The path of cultivation was like a mountain which you continue climb and then one day, you can look down at creation from the top of the world.Even though Lin Feng had shown outstanding talent in Yangzhou City, he wasn\u2019t the least bit conceited. He only knew that he had made some progress on the path of cultivation, but the world was big and the path was long.He didn\u2019t know exactly how vast the Continent of the Nine Clouds was or how powerful the people were. There was no reason to be arrogant when he truly knew so little. There were many geniuses in the continent, for example, that man who accompanied Lin Qian who had a legendary roc spirit. He was so young and much stronger than Lin Feng. He already had the power to confront Yun Hai Sect Elder. He dared come to the Yun Hai Sect and demand respect.\u201cWhen I get back to the pavilion, the first thing I should is choose new techniques of higher difficulty and take the exam to become an elite disciple. Joining the Elite Disciples will enable me to be a real Yun Hai Sect disciple and I\u2019ll be able to participate in the internal affairs of the sect. At the moment, I can\u2019t do anything as an Ordinary Disciple.\u201dLin Feng was thinking about what he was going to do and it was already clear to him what he had to do next.At that moment, he could hear the thunderous hooves of horses in the distance, the ground was shaking.Lin Feng was surprised. He immediately turned around and saw a cloud of dust rise into the air. Armored horses were galloping at full speed.\u201cChi Xue!\u201d Lin Feng was stupefied. Those armored horses were the color of blood. Everyone knew of these horses, it was an extremely valuable horse. It was three times faster than his Qian Li Xue and it was extremely expensive.It was said that a Chi Xue cost a thousand gold coins. It was also said that some special troops had Chi Xue horses. These troops would most likely be battle hardened soldiers.But what were these troops doing in a territory which was under the domination of the Yun Hai Sect.The precious armored horses were approaching at full speed. The people riding them were all soldiers who looked extremely well trained. They were all ferocious and looked extremely dangerous.\u201cThese people can go wherever they want, whenever they want. They are not like the self proclaimed masters and geniuses of Yangzhou City.\u201d thought Lin Feng while slightly trembling at the sight of them. These people were extremely strong, deadly warriors. They were real masters to the extent that the weakest ones of the group would have at least reached the ninth Qi layer but the great majority would have broken into the Ling Qi layer long ago.They are really elite troops\u2026 The smell of blood fills the air even miles away.There were about thirty of them and when they got close to Lin Feng they suddenly slowed down. They raised their heads and looked at the mountain where the Yun Hai Sect was located, this was their destination.Lin Feng had a strange feeling and his expression changed. He could see a figure which looked familiar, when his eyes focuses he could recognize the person.\u201cIt\u2019s her!\u201dOn one of these Chi Xue, there was a girl wearing a red armor, she looked grandiose and heroic. Besides, she was extremely beautiful. Lin Feng would never forget her face.\u201cShit.\u201d Lin Feng thought while remaining vigilant. He hadn\u2019t thought he would meet her there. She was obviously with this group of deadly warriors. That incredibly beautiful girl was a respected and illustrious disciple of the Yun Hai Sect: Liu Fei.\u201cIs that you?\u201d said Liu Fei coldly. She looked angry while looking at Lin Feng. He had dared to disrespect her before. She hadn\u2019t taken her revenge yet, but had not forgotten about it.Lin Feng was cursing in his mind. The group that was with her, they were all much stronger than the group he killed in Yangzhou City. They looked like battle hardened warriors. If they wanted to fight, Lin Feng would be unable to compete with them. That group was so much stronger than him. He was in a desperate situation as they were both faster and stronger than him, he did not want to fight.\u201cFei Fei, you have a problem with that guy?\u201d said a young man next to Liu Fei while looking at Lin Feng. Because Liu Fei looked angry, that guy had also started to show anger.\u201cNo problem, he\u2019s one of my fellow disciples of the Yun Hai Sect. We recognized each other.\u201dThat was unexpected. Liu Fei had shook her head and said that indifferently. Then, she didn\u2019t look at him again and continued.\u201cShall we go inside.\u201d said Liu Fei and then they left while heading towards the Yun Hai Sect. The young man next to Liu Fei glanced at Lin Feng with slight killing intent in his eyes.Lin Feng frowned. He didn\u2019t understand what was going on. As far as he could remember, Liu Fei was rude and cruel, why would she let him go?\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 - Sword of NirvanaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHere is my regular release. I have now changed the schedule, releases will come tuesday instead of Monday. The main reason, because you all keep me up all weekend and I need my beauty sleep.If you ever make me fall asleep with make up on again. I will not be happy, my skin looks blotchy now!!Enjoy xoxox I will probably release the remaining two chapter today!\u201cForget it.\u201d Lin Feng didn\u2019t want to think too much about it. It looked like her status was much higher amongst those soldiers than he had thought. Their power was above his right now.\u201cI am not extremely strong and I do not have any troops to support me.\u201d thought Lin Feng while looking at the group from behind. Lin Feng was determined to do his best once he got back to the Yun Hai Sect and join the elite disciples.Lin Feng rode his horse towards the mountain. Two guards were standing there, their heads dropped to the ground and they did not look at him as he passed. These were the same guards he had met the first time, they had now learnt their lesson and had been humbled.As before, the Yun Hai Sect\u2019s atmosphere was filled with the feeling of power borrowed from heaven and earth. It was very inspiring and motivated Lin Feng even more to increase his strength. Especially since every year, there was the exam to become an elite disciple. The strongest ordinary disciples could join and possibly enter the Elite Disciples, which meant they could become real Yun Hai Sect disciples.Besides, it was also said that the top elite disciples could directly sit an exam and if they passed they would be able to join the Core Disciples of the Yun Hai Sect which made them the foundation of the sect\u2019s power.The Yun Hai Sect had a formidable influence in the Xue Yue Country. While they were not the strongest sect, they were still could not be easily trifled with. Those core disciples were considered the pride and glory of the sect. Even in cities outside of their territory, a Core Disciple of the Yun Hai Sect would be treated with respect and wherever he went. They were supported by the sect itself.It was also the case within clans. For example in the Lin Clan, the Honorable Elder or Lin Ba Dao also regarded Core Disciples of a Sect with respect. In the Lin Clan, they wanted Lin Ba Dao to be the Head of the Clan because they had hoped that Lin Qian could become a Core Disciple of the Hao Yue Sect. This would bring them great honor and greatly rise their status within the country. If Lin Qian progressed, she could even become a Elder in the Hao Yue Sect which would make the Lin Clan extremely influential.Unfortunately, Lin Feng who everyone was sure would become an outstanding figure in the future, wasn\u2019t a member of the Lin Clan anymore and there was still regret remaining over the events.When he arrived in the Yun Hai Sect, Lin Feng first decided to wash the dirt from his body as he had travelled for 10 days. He then put on a clean set of Yun Hai Sect disciple robes. It was now time for him to head to the Xing Chen Pavilion.He had now broken through to the Ling Qi layer. He needed a more advanced agility technique and a higher level martial skill. Only then, he would be to fully unleash his power during a battle.\u201cProtector Bei.\u201d Lin Feng saw the old man who had the same expression as he always had at the entrance of the Xing Chen Pavilion. He looked like he was staring blankly into the horizon.But Lin Feng was extremely happy to know that old man was a protector of the sect and when needed he would become extremely energetic and powerful. Lin Feng knew that the old man sitting in front of the Xing Chen Pavilion could look sluggish but that it was only one aspect of his personality. However, if Lin Feng hadn\u2019t seen it with his own eyes, he would hardly believe that the old man could actually be so powerful.Protector Bei\u2019s expression suddenly changed, he raised his head and looked at Lin Feng with sparkling eyes. He then smiled, which was extremely rare, and said: \u201cOh, you have finally come back.\u201d\u201cYes, I came to find a new Agility Technique to practice.\u201d said Lin Feng while smiling and nodding.\u201cGo to the first floor. Take your time.\u201d replied Protector Bei.\u201cThank you, Protector Bei, thank you for your help and sorry to bother you.\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s goal was to go to the first floor and gain advanced skills. According to the rules of the Yun Hai Sect, only those who had reached the Ling Qi layer or those who were Elite Disciples could go to the first floor. The disciples who had reached the Ling Qi layer but not yet joined the Elite Disciples would have a limited time when selecting skills, they could not take their time. They would also not have access to the second floor without becoming an elite disciple. There was an oil lamp which was lit when they entered the room and when that oil lamp went out, they would have to leave. During that short timeframe, they had to find suitable agility techniques and martial skills for themselves.The time these oil lamps stayed on was normally not enough time to find suitable agility techniques and martial skills. There were a myriad of martial skills and agility techniques in the Xing Chen Pavilion. It was very hard to find something suitable for one\u2019s self in a limited time as there was just such a large number. But rules are rules. Nobody dared violate the rules of the sect. Many Yun Hai Sect disciples wanted to become Elite Disciples to be able to fully access the skills and agility techniques on this floor and the second floor of the Xing Chen Pavilion. That way, they would be able to greatly improve their abilities and find the best techniques for their fighting styles.\u201cNo need to thank me or be sorry for bothering me. Just don\u2019t go to the second floor. You can stay as long as you wish on the ground floor and first floor.\u201d said the old man indifferently.Lin Feng was astonished, stupefied, stunned. Right after, he had a huge smile on his face. Lin Feng definitely was very lucky to have the protector watching over him.\u201cThank you very much, thank you, thank you esteemed protector.\u201dLin Feng became a bit more familiar at that moment when talking to the old man. He then entered the Xing Chen Pavilion and immediately after moved towards the stairs leading to the first floor.\u201cLittle fellow, I\u2019m just worried that your current level of cultivation wouldn\u2019t match those skills and techniques on the higher floors, otherwise I would have told you to go to the third floor.\u201d thought Protector Bei while looking at Lin Feng\u2019s silhouette and then shaking his head and smiling. He then whispered: \u201cThe Precipice of Zhangu\u2026 eight drums\u2026 You have changed the history of the Yun Hai Sect. You will always be able to enter my humble Xing Chen Pavilion as you please.\u201dProtector Bei had a great impression of Lin Feng but the other disciples of the Yun Hai Sect didn\u2019t think that way. When they saw Lin Feng, who was wearing the robes of the ordinary disciples and immediately went up to the first floor of the Xing Chen Pavilion, many people were stupefied.\u201cWho\u2019s that guy? How can he go past the ground floor of the pavilion?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know but he\u2019s clearly an ordinary disciple\u2026 and he is not one of the disciple known for breaking into the Ling Qi layer.\u201dMany people were envious and jealous. Not only could higher level agility techniques enable cultivators to greatly increase their speed and benefit cultivation but it also enabled them to greatly increase their overall fighting strength. It enabled them to use movements of a higher difficulty. In a battle, it could enable them to have a clear advantage in speed over their opponent. Who wouldn\u2019t want that?All the Agility Techniques and martial skills were divided into different levels: Sky level, Earth level, Xuan level, Yellow level\u2026 These skills and agility techniques were spread over four levels in the Xing Chen Pavilion. On the ground floor of the pavilion were yellow level skills and agility techniques, on the first floor were skills and agility techniques of the Xuan level and were extremely powerful.The first floor of the Xing Chen Pavilion was much more quiet than the ground floor. There were very few people on the first floor. They were all quietly looking for amazing skills and techniques suitable for themselves.At that moment, many people saw Lin Feng go upstairs and looked at him with disdain.\u201cThere are less martial skills and agility techniques than on the ground floor.\u201d Lin Feng thought while looking at all the skills on the first floor. No matter what, these skills and agility techniques were extremely valuable. They were obviously very hard to find, therefore there were less skills on the first floor than on the ground floor.\u201cLet\u2019s find an agility technique.\u201d thought Lin Feng while looking at all the books and then immediately started to read them and analyze the skills.\u201cPurity Technique, Xuan level, absorbs the energy of the power of heaven and earth to purify the body, regulates body functions and provides greater control over the body, practice to the highest level and your body will be faster, stronger and controlled with ease.\u201d\u201cPlease note that this skill is suitable for any spirit. It cannot be practiced very quickly as the muscles and vessels must first become used to the change within the body. Improving too quickly would have the opposite effects and the body would become exhausted and possibly damaged.\u201dThat was one of the techniques. There was a small note written on that book enabling those of the younger generations to understand it in more detail.\u201cI guess I will take this one\u2026\u201d said Lin Feng in a low voice. As if he hadn\u2019t seen the warning written by hand in the book, Lin Feng immediately chose that technique.Lin Feng didn\u2019t even look at the other techniques. He knew what he was doing.Everything about that Purity Agility Technique looked useless but Lin Feng thought it was great.\u201cLet\u2019s find some martial skills now.\u201d thought Lin Feng while moving towards to the skill shelves.\u201cDead Forest.\u201d\u201cScorching Apocalypse.\u201d\u201cDeadly Frost.\u201dLin Feng was looking at all these skills but found none of them satisfying.\u201cEight Strikes of Desolation. Xuan level. Eight extremely powerful strikes which cover the heavens and are almost impossible to dodge.This skill drew Lin Feng\u2019s attention.\u201cI will also take this one\u201d Lin Feng took that book but didn\u2019t leave, he needed another martial skill, it had been too long since he had practiced any new martial skills. So he needed to increase his battle power quickly.After a while, Lin Feng found a sword skill which was extremely powerful and of the Xuan level but it required a sword spirit to perfectly comprehend. It also required a perfect understanding of sword force. If someone did not understand the world and the elemental forces within, it would be impossible to comprehend this skill. It was called Sword of Nirvana.Many disciples had avoided this skill as the conditions to learn it were incredibly harsh. They would not only need to understand sword force, but the world around them and other elemental forces. They would need a great deal of comprehension.\u201cLucky, I have found another.\u201d Lin Feng was excited. It seemed like the Sword of Nirvana had been prepared especially for him. Requiring understanding of sword force and also requiring a perfect understanding of the world and the forces contained within. He could gain a perfect understanding of the world and forces within by using his spirit. It was a perfect skill for him.This skill was made for him.The requirement of having a sword spirit in order to learn the skill was a joke. Was someone who had a sword spirit more knowledgeable about swords than Lin Feng?\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 - The Top Ordinary DisciplePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cLet me have a look at that skill book.\u201d suddenly said a voice coming from the left.Lin Feng turned around and saw two young disciples. There was a young man who looked extremely evil while staring at the other disciple. Besides, his manner of speaking sounded like he was giving the other disciple an order.That other young disciple was called Chen Chen. Lin Feng had already seen him before. He was an ordinary disciple, just like Lin Feng. However, he was much more famous than Lin Feng.\u201cThis skill is mine.\u201d said Chen Chen while coldly staring at the evil looking disciple. It wasn\u2019t rare to see elite disciples despise ordinary disciples and this was clearly a case of an elite disciple trying to bully Chen Chen.\u201cHow insolent, for an ordinary disciple to dare refuse my request!\u201d shouted the young man furiously while releasing an extremely strong Qi from his body.\u201cPfff, Li Lin, don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t know who you are. You are one of the weakest elite disciples. You only dare show off in front of us ordinary disciples. This year at the upcoming elite disciple exam, I, Chen Chen, will remove that smug head from your body. I will make your head roll from the fighting stage into the dirt where you belong.\u201d said Chen Chen while emanating killing intent.\u201cLi Lin, you are an ordinary little boy, that\u2019s all you are. Haha. You\u2019re a joke.\u201dAll those who were on the second floor of the Xing Chen Pavilion were looking at them and laughing. Chen Chen was right, Li Lin was an elite disciple but he was extremely weak in comparison with the other disciples of the sect. In order not to feel inferior in front of other people, he regularly went and bullied ordinary disciples trying to use his authority and power to gain a feeling of superiority. He hadn\u2019t thought that today he would meet this kind of stubborn ordinary disciple who would actually refuse and insult him.Chen Chen was one of the top ranking ordinary disciples within the Sect. He had a flame spirit. All of his fire based skills were extremely powerful and he could gain insights into fire based techniques much quicker than other disciples. Nobody could compete with him. He was extremely strong. His main objective was to participate in the elite disciple exam of the Yun Hai Sect and become an elite disciple where he could gain extra resources for cultivation.Obviously, when Li Lin heard what Chen Chen said, he became furious. He had already heard Chen Chen\u2019s name and knew exactly how powerful he was. It really was his bad luck that he chose to bully the wrong disciple.\u201cThere\u2019s misunderstanding. Alright, I\u2019m not looking at that skill.\u201d said Li Lin whose facial expression had completely changed. He then retreated away from Chen Chen.Laughter could be heard amongst all of the disciples who were present on the second floor. They clearly thought that that Li Lin was a good for nothing elite disciple. He had just been terrified by an ordinary disciple. To have an elite disciple back down from an ordinary disciple was a humiliation in itself.\u201cWhat are you laughing at?! Laugh again and I will cripple your cultivation!\u201dLi Lin regretted his previous actions because he had humiliated himself in the end. He had the feeling that everyone was laughing at him, he needed to find someone so he could have relief from his fury, so his threat was directed towards Lin Feng.He couldn\u2019t afford to provoke Chen Chen more than he already had but he did have the abilities required to provoke other ordinary disciple?Lin Feng was about to leave the Pavilion, he was stupefied at the threat he had received. He did not even laugh and had just continued with what he was originally there for. Did he laugh without realizing?In fact, from the beginning to the end, he had remained expressionless. He had been annoyed by the confrontation that was happening but had remained expressionless. That guy didn\u2019t dare provoke the others, did that give him the right to treat Lin Feng as a punching bag?\u201cObviously. Fear the strong and bully the weak.\u201d thought Lin Feng with disdain. He was scared of Chen Chen and couldn\u2019t continue to bully him so he had come to bully Lin Feng.But Lin Feng wasn\u2019t in the mood to deal with this special kind of childishness. He had chosen his agility technique and martial skills and was satisfied with them. It wasn\u2019t necessary for him to stay in the Pavilion anymore so he decided to go downstairs.Lin Feng started walking in the direction of the exit.\u201cSTOP! You worthless ordinary disciple! How dare you ignore me!\u201d said Li Lin looking cruel. He had now run in front of Lin Feng to prevent him from leaving.Lin Feng smiled coldly. That guy obviously just wanted to show off in front of the others as he had just lost face.\u201cWorthless ordinary disciple? It looks like you\u2019re the one who just got humiliated by an ordinary disciple.\u201dLin Feng had said that in a joking tone. It clearly showed that Li Lin really had no sense of shame.\u201cYou want to die.\u201d\u201cIndeed, you\u2019re right.\u201d said Lin Feng coldly before adding: \u201cLi Lin, is that your name? I don\u2019t have time to waste on you. Let\u2019s meet at the Stormy Gorge in the Life and Death Arena before the elite disciple exam.When Lin Feng said these words, everybody around laughed again. Lin Feng was surprisingly challenging Li Lin as well, but that time with their life at stake. Could Li Lin reject the challenge after being humiliated to such an extent?\u201cInteresting.\u201d murmured some of the disciples watching from the sidelines. Li Lin looked perplexed. He didn\u2019t know what to think about what had just happened. Lin Feng had surprisingly challenged him to a fight to the death, knowing full well that elite disciples could kill ordinary disciples in the gorge. Would he be strong enough?\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll wait for you there.\u201d Li Lin said. Li Lin was caught between a rock and a hard place. Chen Chen knew that too. If he had been scared of an ordinary disciple again, he would have had to hide himself forever from all other disciples in the Sect. He couldn\u2019t afford to lose face again.Li Lin turned around and immediately left.Lin Feng smiled inside. He didn\u2019t look at his opponent. If he wasn\u2019t able to defeat the weakest elite disciple of the Sect, it would mean he hasn\u2019t made any progress and has actually stepped backwards on the path of cultivation. He had already battled an elite disciple when he was only at the eighth Qi layer.\u201cHehe, what\u2019s your name? To be able to come to this floor, it means that you\u2019ve already broken through to the Ling Qi layer. How come I\u2019ve never seen you before?\u201d Chen Chen asked. Chen Chen was ranked first from all the ordinary disciples. He knew all of the strongest ordinary disciples by name and had measured their strength against his own. He also knew who had broken through to the Ling Qi layer within the sect and how many ordinary disciples had broken through. He was getting prepared to join the elite disciple exam of the Yun Hai Sect and hoped to become an elite disciple. He made sure to know about everyone who he would be competing against.But Chen Chen had never seen Lin Feng\u2026\u201cLin Feng. I\u2019m not popular so it\u2019s normal that you\u2019ve never seen me.\u201d replied Lin Feng while smiling in a friendly way.\u201cLin Feng, you mean the rumored piece of trash!?\u201d Chen Chen was stunned. He had never seen him but he had already heard Lin Feng\u2019s name many times.\u201cHaha, it seems like one shouldn\u2019t believe rumors. How could a piece of trash have broken through to the Ling Qi layer?\u201d said Chen Chen while smiling and shaking his head. Then, he added: \u201cBut even though we are both fellow ordinary disciples, there is still a big gap between you and me. Actually, there\u2019s a gigantic gap between you and me, there is nothing comparable. Soon I will become an Elite Disciple, we are not the same.\u201dLin Feng was a bit surprised. Lin Feng understood what Chen Chen meant. He was referring to the fact that Lin Feng had said to Li Lin that he had been humiliated by another ordinary disciple.In Chen Chen\u2019s eyes, Lin Feng\u2019s sentence meant that he was saying that they were on the same level. Chen Chen thought that they had nothing in common. He was of course the strongest and Lin Feng was not strong enough to be his equal.\u201cIt seems like you are very self confident.\u201d replied Lin Feng, not losing his temper and still smiling in a friendly way.\u201cIndeed, at least when I am amongst ordinary disciples. I am the number one ranked ordinary disciple.\u201d replied Chen Chen.\u201cAlright I see. It is said that ordinary disciples need an oil lamp when they are on the first floor and then when it goes off, they must leave. You are indeed very strong, but do you dare exceed that amount of time?\u201d said Lin Feng while laughing.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to flatter me. Indeed, all of the ordinary disciples need that oil lamp on the first floor. However, I am an exception. Because of my strength, I am not bound by the rules. Who would dare say otherwise?\u201d said Chen Chen mocking that the rules were only meant for the weak.\u201cIs that so?\u201d Lin Feng was smiling and seemed to be very interested. \u201cWell, actually, I also can stay as long as I wish on the first floor but I try to follow the sect rules. You are the first ranked ordinary disciple, you are so strong. It\u2019s no problem for me to stay here as long as I wish so of course it would be even less of a problem for you right?\u201d\u201cAre you joking? You plan to stay longer than the time allocated by the oil lamp?\u201d said Chen Chen with a cold smile filled with disdain.\u201cCan you not see with your own eyes?\u201d said Lin Feng with a meaningful smile on his face. He then stopped paying attention to Chen Chen. He then started looking at another skill. He didn\u2019t intend to practice it but looking and learning was a wise thing to do.\u201cThat guy must be crazy. Continuing to stay on the floor\u2026\u201d All the Elite Disciples on the first floor looked at him with interest. They all started to pay attention to the scene that appeared before them. They wanted to see how long he was going to stay.\u201cHmph.\u201d Chen Chen groaned. Lin Feng had arrived before him so he wasn\u2019t in a hurry. Lin Feng\u2019s oil lamp would burn out before his and the lie would be exposed.The time for half a lamp to burn had already passed. Chen Chen was looking at a skill. He was frowning, he didn\u2019t have much time left on his lamp.He looked at Lin Feng and saw that, as before, he was leaning against the bookshelf looking sluggish and still looking at a skill book. He looked like he was absolutely unaware of the time that was passing. He didn\u2019t even pay attention to it.\u201cHow long can you keep playing your little game?\u201d Chen Chen wasn\u2019t even in the mood to look at skills anymore. He was soon going to be an elite disciple anyway, he would be able to spend as much as he wished on the first floor and could look at as many skills as he wanted. He was watching Lin Feng and waiting for him to make a fool of himself.But Chen Chen was disappointed. Some time passed again and Lin Feng didn\u2019t seem to be reacting at all. It seemed like he had completely lost the notion of time. He just continued to read the skills leisurely.\u201cAre you not leaving yet?\u201d asked Chen Chen unable to remain calm. He had almost no time left on his oil lamp. If he didn\u2019t leave, he would be severely punished by the Sect for breaking the rules.\u201cI\u2019m not worried, why are you worried? You are the top ranked ordinary disciple of the Yun Hai Sect! You are a genius!\u201d Lin Feng said in an indifferent tone but everybody understood that he was making fun of Chen Chen.Chen Chen suddenly became furious and said: \u201cYou want to die. I\u2019m not staying here with you. When you come out, I hope you can explain everything to me.\u201dAfter threatening Lin Feng, Chen Chen turned around and left the Xing Chen Pavilion.\u201cTop ranked ordinary disciple? He is just a fool, nothing more.\u201d thought Lin Feng while sneering at him which made Chen Chen who was looking at him even more furious and killing intent had appeared in his eyes.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 - Liu Cang LanPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChen Chen actually hadn\u2019t left the Pavilion. He wasn\u2019t in a hurry to leave. Instead, he was waiting at the entrance door.\u201cYou slightly exceeded the time limit. Next time, please pay attention.\u201d said Protector Bei while looking at Chen Chen and shaking his head.\u201cI slightly exceeded the time limit but there\u2019s another guy who\u2019s been in there for ages, way over the time limit. I want to see what will happen to him.\u201d thought Chen Chen waiting for Lin Feng to come down.Lin Feng didn\u2019t make Chen Chen wait for too long. A short time after, he also came down looking relaxed as if there was no problem at all.\u201cProtector Bei, here are the skills and agility technique that I chose.\u201d said Lin Feng while glancing at Chen Chen. Lin Feng handed skill and agility technique books over to the Protector Bei while smiling in a friendly way.\u201cPurity Technique\u2026 It will help you consolidate your agility basics. It is definitely worth learning.\u201d said Protector Bei while looking at the agility technique and skills which Lin Feng had chosen. He was nodding with agreement. He then added: \u201cEight Strikes of Desolation is at the bottom of the Xuan Level skills, yet, it is an extremely powerful skill. It is hard to learn and practice but considering your abilities, it should not be too much of a problem. Concerning the Sword of Nirvana, which is a triple strike attack, everybody can learn it but only a real genius can master it to perfection. People who manage to master it to perfection are really rare. You will have to make great efforts to achieve such a mastery of this skill.Protector Bei was still looking at the agility technique and skills that Lin Feng had chosen and continued to give his opinion: \u201cIf someday by any chance, you manage to carry out these three hits using the Sword of Nirvana at full strength, then don\u2019t learn another skill which is at the bottom of the Xuan Level or even an average Xuan Level\u2026 Directly move on and learn a high Xuan level skill. However, if you manage to master the skill, you will not have a problem even if it collides with a high level Xuan skill.Lin Feng was smiling when he heard what the old man was telling him. The gap between the different sub-levels of the Xuan level was colossal but if Lin Feng managed to master that skill, he would still be able to carry out amazingly strong attacks which could match a high level Xuan skill.At the side of the pavilion, Protector Bei and Lin Feng were talking and laughing cheerfully. The more they talked, the uglier and angrier Chen Chen\u2019s face looked. It looked like Lin Feng and Protector Bei were actually friends. No wonder Lin Feng took such liberties.\u201cHe was on the First floor for a long time, more than that allocated within an oil lamp.\u201d said Chen Chen interrupting them in the middle of their conversation which made Protector Bei smile. He then turned his head and looked at Chen Chen.\u201cI know.\u201d said Protector Bei calm and unperturbed.\u201cSince you know that he violated the rules of the Sect, shouldn\u2019t he be severely punished?!\u201d Chen Chen hadn\u2019t expected Protector Bei to admit it in such a straightforward way while looking like he was feeling completely at ease. He was feeling even more furious.Protector Bei looked at Chen Chen with a strict look. He shook his head and then said: \u201cI\u2019ve been here for many, many years. No matter who, elite disciples or even core disciples, have to go through me when they want to enter the Xing Chen Pavilion. What do you think? Are you implying that you are trying to teach me, with my many years of experience, how to do my job?\u201dProtector Bei was an extraordinary person. The Patriarch of the Yun Hai Sect, Nan Gong Ling, showed a lot of respect to him when he saw him. In his eyes, common ordinary disciples were tiny individuals with no power, nothing more. Even if it was the top ranking ordinary disciples, it was still a tiny individual with no power, a nobody who was not worth his time. It would even be a struggle for elite disciples to be considered less than a tiny insignificant power in front of this protector.Lin Feng was an exception. The first time he had met Lin Feng, he had had an extremely good first impression. He immediately had the impression that Lin Feng was polite and wise beyond his years. Later, he had also found out that Lin Feng was extremely gifted, especially when he had made the eight drums beat. Therefore, he held Lin Feng in the highest of esteem.What did Chen Chen think? How could he allow himself to interrogate the old man like he had done? How could Protector Bei treat him with esteem?When Chen Chen heard Protector Bei\u2019s words, his face started looking demonic. He then said in an extremely cold way: \u201cYour only job is just to guard the Xing Chen Pavilion. You dare not apply the rules of the Sect. That is a very serious crime against the sect, how dare you.\u201d\u201cEh\u2026\u201d Lin Feng was speechless and shocked by Chen Chen\u2019s words\u2026 No wonder he was such an imbecile when it came to cultivation and relied on his spirit to achieve minor results. That guy didn\u2019t have the least bit of wisdom in his heart. What did that guy think he was doing when threatening Protector Bei and accusing him of having committed a serious crime? The top ranked ordinary disciple\u2026 that guy was living in a dream. He was so used to thinking he was a valuable and noteworthy talent that he had forgotten his place.Protector Bei looked at Chen Chen in a way which clearly showed how ridiculous he thought Chen Chen was. The old man had worked there for a great many years and had never experienced such a thing. He also never got angry\u2026 and then at that moment, an ordinary disciple had dared come to him and interrogate him and then tell him that he had committed a crime.Protector Bei was shaking his head. He started opening his mouth but looked like he was still thinking about what to say when his facial expression suddenly changed and shouted: \u201cGet lost!\u201dAfter saying these two words, an insane strength burst out and crashed onto Chen Chen\u2019s body. At that moment, Protector Bei\u2019s eyes were filled with a sharp killing light. His body was unleashing an extremely strong Qi.Chen Chen had just felt the extremely strong power against his body and had ended up kneeling down on the ground shaking from head to toe.Chen Chen wasn\u2019t the only one who was shaking from head to toe with fear, people inside the Xing Chen Pavilion had also been shocked by the loud shout. Some of them had come to see what was happening and saw the protector\u2019s body surrounded by such a strong and powerful Qi. They all kept quiet with fear. As it turned out, that old man who looked sluggish was actually as strong or even stronger than the elders within the sect and looked like a powerful deity to the disciples.The old man\u2019s strength was genuinely powerful without question.It was well known that when breaking through to the Ling Qi layer from the Qi layer, Cultivators acquired a mysterious and profound strength. When breaking through to the Xuan Qi layer from the Ling Qi layer, it was said that the Cultivator\u2019s three energies, the Qi, the Shen and the Jing, fused together which enabled the Cultivator to acquire a genuinely pure and immense power.The Qi inside the body became genuinely pure like the Qi of Heaven and Earth. A tiny bit of that pure power contained an extremely condensed Qi and when it was used in an attack, it could destroy an entire mountain.Protector Bei\u2019s shout had actually released that genuinely pure power. The power that had crashed onto Chen Chen\u2019s body wasn\u2019t immensely strong because Protector Bei had controlled his power perfectly but it had revealed the fact that he was an extremely strong Cultivator who had broken through to the Xuan Qi layer.Xuan Qi layer; that was an incomparably strong cultivation level. He could easily become an elder in the Yun Hai Sect.\u201cI will be taking my leave.\u201d said Chen Chen while pale but still looking at Lin Feng with an evil look and added: \u201cPiece of trash\u2026 relying on other people\u2019s strength\u2026 If you join the elite exam, at that moment, I will take good care of you.\u201dWhen saying those words, Chen Chen turned around and left with his head held high.Lin Feng shook his head while looking at Chen Chen. Even though that guy was the top ranked ordinary disciple, he was extremely arrogant and thought he was better than others. He didn\u2019t know anything else but the small place in which he lived and thought he had seen and knew everything. He really did not understand how large the world was and did not know that hidden dragons lay everywhere.Protector Bei\u2019s strength was immense, he wouldn\u2019t even spare a glance at a cultivator like Chen Chen who was ranked at the top of ordinary disciple. Why would he go out of his way to do favors for Lin Feng? If Chen Chen had even the slightest wisdom then he would come to the conclusion that he had met someone he could not offend.Besides, everything that had happened was all part of Chen Chen attempting to show his dominance over Lin Feng. By attempting to show off, he had humiliated himself several times.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I had to do something like this. I am much too old for things such as this\u201d thought Protector Bei. Then he said: \u201cXue Yue, when I leave, you\u2019ll be in charge of the Xing Chen Pavilion.\u201dAfter he finished talking, his body started shaking and wings of a crane appeared. Then, he flew high up in the air and disappeared.The crowd was stupefied. They had seen how he had suddenly vanished into the horizon. What a terrifying power. He could even fly. What kind of power was this old man hiding?That old man could travel over ten kilometers in the blink of an eye. That required an extremely profound power. The crowd had the feeling they were in a dream. The sluggish looking old man who guarded the Xing Chen Pavilion had suddenly shown his real power. At that moment, they hated themselves for not noticing and never asking the old man for advice. They had all ignored him, they had eyes but did not recognize Mount Tai.Lin Feng was stupefied as well. His heart was pounding in amazement. Protector Bei was a million times stronger than he was. Much stronger than he had originally thought.A middle aged man entered the Xing Chen Pavilion. That was the one Protector Bei had called before leaving: Xue Yue.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026At that moment, on the highest mountain on the Yun Hai Sect, in the room of a temple, a gigantic Qi was filling the atmosphere.Many people had gathered in that room and it looked like there were debating about something.\u201cFei Fei, I will consider this with great attention. You should stop worrying.\u201d Said the Patriarch of the Yun Hai Sect, Nan Gong Ling, while smiling. He was speaking to Liu Fei who was sitting next to him.Behind Liu Fei were a multitude of people wearing the same attire. They were all wearing noble red armor. They were precisely the people Lin Feng had seen at the foot of the mountain. They were the troops who were riding Chi Xue armored horses.When she heard Nan Gong Ling\u2019s answer, Liu Fei\u2019s beautiful eyebrows frowned. Nan Gong Ling hadn\u2019t replied happily, in fact it could be seen that he was not happy in the slightest. But Liu Fei could understand him. Letting some of the best disciples of the Yun Hai Sect leave with her was a difficult decision.Each of the Yun Hai Sect disciples would go on to have children who represented a great future for the Sect. How could Nan Gong Ling abandon any of them easily.\u201cUncle Nan Gong Ling, you know that my father is not a selfish person. It is fate and it is for the benefit of the Xue Yue Country. He will definitely let them come back to the Yun Hai Sect. He will treat them well. At that moment, they will all be able to assume a high status and will become pillars of the Sect.\u201dLiu Fei continued her argumentation.\u201cYour father and I practiced cultivation together, grew up together\u2026 We love each other like brothers. If he stayed in the Yun Hai Sect, he could have become the Patriarch of the Sect. How could I, Nan Gong Ling, not know what kind of man he is? The thing is that now, as the Patriarch of the Yun Hai Sect, everything I do, I must do it considering what is good and bad for the sect first. I cannot selfishly decide things myself.\u201dNan Gong Ling didn\u2019t elaborate more at that moment. He remembered all the things he and Liu Cang Lan used to do together without thinking of the consequences of their actions. They were two geniuses of the Yun Hai Sect. But these days, as the Patriarch of the Sect, he couldn\u2019t act irresponsibly anymore.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 - Holy Courtyard of Xue YuePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Liu Fei heard Nan Gong Ling\u2019s speech, she heaved a sigh. Actually, she could understand the difficult position in which Nan Gong Ling found himself. Yet, she was concerned about her father who also had to bear huge responsibilities, she was really trying her best to help him by any means possible.\u201cPatriarch, Nan Gong Ling, building the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue is an order of His Majesty. Could you refuse to obey His Majesty\u2019s orders?\u201d Said a young man who was next to Liu Fei while staring at Nan Gong Ling.\u201cWhen did I say that I wanted to disobey His Majesty\u2019s orders?\u201d Nan Gong Ling replied coldly while glancing at the young man. He then said: \u201cBuilding the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue is a project which I support wholeheartedly. I have no choice but to let a few outstanding disciples go and practice there.He paused for a moment and then continued in a cold tone: \u201cBesides, since when did you start to think it was good manners to poke your nose into other people\u2019s affairs and make criticisms? A little prince like you\u2026 What do you intend to do? Do you want me to call your father, Duan Tian Lang and have him teach you some manners?\u201dIn the Continent of the Nine Clouds, elders had to be respected. Nobles also had to be respected which was especially true of those with high status as they were extremely strong. These days, the Duan Clan had become the Imperial Clan because they were extremely strong. The Duan Clan had become the strongest clan in the entire Xue Yue Country. It wasn\u2019t just a matter of how much territory was controlled, it was a fact that they were the strongest.However, the Duan Clan still had to humble themselves to the Sects and act politely when speaking with them. Nan Gong Ling wasn\u2019t going to submit himself to a little prince of the Duan Clan. It did not matter to him how strong the Duan Clan was, his sect was not something that could be looked down upon by anyone.\u201cYou\u2026 Nan Gong Ling, I will tell my father about this.\u201d said the young man coldly while giving a glare filled with evil intentions.\u201cTell him whatever you like.\u201d replied Nan Gong Ling while looking relaxed and not surprised.\u201cI heard that little Fei Fei came back.\u201d At that moment, a voice came from outside of the room in the temple. It was Protector Bei who had just arrived while striding forward with head high.\u201cGrandfather Bei!\u201d When Liu Fei saw Protector Bei, she stood up. Protector Bei was actually her father\u2019s master.\u201cLittle Fei, how\u2019s your father doing?\u201d Protector Bei was looking at Liu Fei with affectionate eyes. The great elders and protectors of the Sect rarely had direct disciples. When they did, they developed deep and strong ties with them which would last a lifetime.\u201cHe\u2019s still in Duan Ren City\u2026\u201d said Liu Fei making a wry smile.\u201cPheww..\u201d sighed Protector Bei shaking his head and making a wry smile as well.\u201cLittle Fei, what brings you here? If you are looking for disciples then I have an amazing person in mind. You will definitely be happy.\u201d\u201cOne person?\u201d said Liu Fei making a wry smile again.\u201cDidn\u2019t your father leave the sect alone in the past? You don\u2019t need too many people. It\u2019s useless to take too many.\u201d said Protector Bei while shaking his head.\u201cGrandfather, who are you talking about?\u201d Liu Fei\u2019s eyes had a glimmer of hope. When she heard the old man, she had the feeling he was talking about somebody extremely important. Could it be\u2026.?\u201cYou will know when the right moment comes. Make those guys leave first. After the elite disciple exam of the Yun Hai Sect, I will personally accompany the person to the Imperial City.\u201d said Protector Bei while looking at the crowd of troops behind Liu Fei.\u201cAlright.\u201d said Liu Fei while nodding.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026In the mountains where he had first met Liu Fei, Lin Feng was sitting in a cave and cultivating. The Qi of heaven and earth looked like a cocoon which was surrounding him as he continued to cultivate. Lin Feng\u2019s body was wrapped up in the cocoon-like Qi. That white-colored Qi looked like an extremely dense fog which had almost become solid.At that moment, a terrifying attractive force emerged out of the deepest parts of Lin Feng\u2019s body which enabled the Qi of Heaven and Earth that surrounding his body to penetrate into his dantian.Inside Lin Feng\u2019s body, a powerful milky-white Qi was circulating and looked as if it was boiling. The strong Qi which circulated in and out of Lin Feng\u2019s body was extremely pure.After a long time, the Qi of Heaven and Earth was still uninterruptedly revolving around Lin Feng\u2019s body. At that moment, Lin Feng stopped cultivating.He opened his eyes and had a big smile on his face.\u201cThis Purity Technique has such strange effects on the body\u2026 but it definitely helped consolidate my cultivation basics. Now, I am much stronger than before, I can utilize my power much better than before. I can control my breathing much better than before as well.\u201dLin Feng thought that thanks to his increased breathing abilities, he would be able to endlessly fight. A continuous explosive strength required a great power and of course every fight required control over ones breathing.Lin Feng stood up, looked at a wall at the entrance of the cave, then thrust his palm forward into the air and whispered: \u201cEight Strikes of Desolation.\u201dAccompanying his words, a strong and explosive attack crashed into the wall in front of him.\u201cBOOM!.\u201d\u201cBOOM!.\u201d\u201cBOOM!.\u201d\u201cBOOM!.\u201d\u201cBOOM!.\u201d\u201cBOOM!.\u201d\u201cBOOM!.\u201dThe entire cave was vibrating. Seven clear and distinct marks could be seen on the wall which Lin Feng had taken as a target.\u201cAs expected, Eight Strikes of Desolation is an extremely strong attack.\u201dLin Feng was smiling. Eight Strikes of Desolation was one of the lowest skills of the Xuan level. It could have up to eight strikes. If a Cultivator managed to achieve five strikes, that was already extremely strong and proved that he had great talent. If he could manage to go up to six strikes, he was definitely a rare talent\u2026 but achieving seven strikes could only be done by a real genius.Lin Feng wanted to achieve eight strikes. Achieving eight strikes would fill the entire atmosphere with power. However achieving the eighth strike was extremely difficult and only real geniuses could achieve it. It usually required a lot of battle experience to fully comprehend the skill and master it to perfection.Xuan level skills\u2026 were not easy to practice and the higher the level and strength, the more difficult they became.However, as far as Lin Feng was concerned he could see no problem with practicing. When releasing his dark spirit, it gave him the amazing ability of increased comprehension and understanding. After one day, he had been able to master seven strikes. He just had to practice a bit more and he would be able to master the Eight Strikes of Desolation skill to perfection and achieve all eight strikes when using the skill.But Lin Feng wasn\u2019t satisfied at that moment. Elite Disciples had nothing in common with ordinary disciples and Lin Feng wanted to climb above all others. During the elite disciple exam of the Yun Hai Sect, there could be a real genius within the disciples\u2026Lin Feng didn\u2019t know how it was going to be, but the stronger his competition was the better.Sword of Nirvana would greatly improve his strength in a very short time as well.The Sword of Nirvana skill was actually a sword skill with three strikes which would grow in strength with the higher mastery of the sword. One strike could mean death, three strikes would mean certain death.A deadly sword.A fatal sword.A lonely sword.It could annihilate everything that stood in its way, so it had annihilated everything in its path. It had nothing left that was its equal and was therefore lonely.While reading the Sword of Nirvana skill book, Lin Feng was lost in thought. He looked at the text and the stances while gradually absorbing all of the knowledge. Lin Feng could rapidly understand everything. Lin Feng had started to release his spirit. Lin Feng\u2019s world became a world filled with darkness again. The Earth, the Sky, not a single color or light could be seen. There was only darkness surrounding everything. Lin Feng was calm and unperturbed in that world of darkness, nothing could disturb him and he was extremely calm.Lin Feng closed his eyes and the image of a person appeared in his brain. That person looked like a holy man and didn\u2019t stop wielding his long sword. One strike, another strike, repeating the same movement over and over again, he was practicing the Sword of Nirvana. The deadly sword.After a long time, Lin Feng opened his eyes. The twinkling sword lacerating the air disappeared.One step, one strike, the deadly sword.\u201cBOOOM!\u201dThe entire cave was shaking and trembling. The sword had left a large scar in the wall of the cave.The cave was shaking and trembling more and more, the rocks had been crushed into nothing but dust. Lin Feng was stupefied. Lin Feng had quickly retreated from the cave and not long after, the cave collapsed on itself with a violent rumble.The first strike was already so deadly. Combined with the Eight strikes of desolation he had completely destroyed the cave. He had only mastered the first strike of the sword of nirvana and the seventh strike of the Eight Strikes of Desolation, yet he had already collapsed a cave. These were indeed powerful skills. Lin Feng recalled his spirit back into his body. He was very excited. Xuan level sills were definitely extremely powerful, as expected. Was the power of all his skills going to be so incredible?What Lin Feng didn\u2019t know was that the first strike was already devastating because he also knew how to control forces. He had unconsciously controlled the sword force at a very advanced level and combined it with his strike.That deadly sword required a perfect fusion of his sword Qi, mastery of the skill and sword force. These three elements had to be in a perfect symbiotic fusion. Ling Feng\u2019s ability to comprehend and use the sword force so freely had made things much easier for him. That is why it wasn\u2019t that difficult for him to practice the skill. If it had been someone else, it would have been much more difficult, maybe even impossible to learn the skill in such a short period.\u201cWho?\u201d Lin Feng had come out from the cave, turned around and looked around him at the mountains where the sun rays shone through. He could see someone walking in the distance. When he recognized the person, Lin Feng felt a sudden urge to take revenge which he suppressed.\u201cLiu Fei.\u201d Lin Feng was surprised. He didn\u2019t understand what she was doing there. She had had the opportunity to attack him before and she hadn\u2019t seized it. Why?\u201cBastard, you took control over my territory. Today, you and me are enemies. You are the only one who has humiliated me to such an extent.\u201d Liu Fei was staring at Lin Feng with a deep and bitter hatred for him. Since she was a child, her father had taught her to stand alone and be independent. She had always been like that. She was more of a tomboy and didn\u2019t really act like a girl in the slightest. Besides, she had gone through a lot of hardships which made her even more proud and ambitious.But Liu Fei hadn\u2019t expected Lin Feng to be so shameless, he was a voyeur and had pounced naked onto her only to be beaten back and then when they next fought he had dared to say he wasn\u2019t interested in her anymore only because he had made great progress with his cultivation. Then, he had dared to steal her precious and beloved territory. How could she not be angry?\u201cNow, I have broken through to the Ling Qi layer, we will see if you still dare act so insolent towards me.\u201d Liu Fei thought tyrannically.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Thank you xoEnjoy xoxox\u201cI have already defeated you three times. Apologize to me and I might show mercy and let you off.\u201d Liu Fei said in an ice cold tone.\u201cDefeated three times? Show mercy?\u201d Lin Feng laughed, shook his head and said: \u201cJust leave already before it becomes too embarrassing for you to stay.\u201dLiu Fei and Lin Feng had already met a few times. Lin Feng knew how proud and arrogant that girl was, so she would not accept others help and would use her own power. Therefore, when Yu Hao, an Elite Disciple wanted to help her to kill Lin Feng, she refused even though she just had nod once and Yu Hao would kill Lin Feng. She still didn\u2019t do it.Then, at the foot of the mountain, with these cavaliers on Chi Xue armored horses, Liu Fei had said in a cold voice that they were fellow disciples within the sect. She didn\u2019t try to get her revenge with numbers.Therefore, even though Lin Feng thought that that girl was quite detestable, he didn\u2019t think that she was evil or malicious. Maybe during the first time Lin Feng had come to her place, she had really believed that he was a pervert and that it was no accident at all.\u201cEmbarrassing?\u201d Liu Fei was looking at Lin Feng looking horribly self confident now she had a breakthrough.\u201cYou should go home. My father gave me a silver Xuan Bow. If you do not leave quickly then I will let you taste its arrows.\u201dLiu Fei grabbed the silver bow she was carrying on her back. It diffused a dazzling light and the sun was reflecting from every inch of the bow.She put an arrow into the bow, made a small step and bent down\u2026 her movements looked smooth and agile. Her beautiful body, her clothes and her movements were in perfect harmony. She looked very attractive\u2026 but that beauty was hiding her dangerous power.\u201cWhoosh\u2026.\u201dThe sound of a bowstring vibrating could be heard as the arrow shot through the air at incredible speed. Its dazzling light made it look like it was on fire. It was heading directly towards Lin Feng. Lin Feng was stupefied. The arrow was approaching so quickly that escaping seemed impossible.He quickly moved from the path of the arrow and struck his sword against the incoming arrow. The arrow flew past Lin Feng and crashed into the side of a cave which was behind him.\u201cBOOOOM!.\u201dBehind Lin Feng, rocks were falling from the cave and half of the rock face had been destroyed. It had been crushed by Liu Fei\u2019s arrow. That attack was quite violent and contained a great deal of power.\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Feng was surprised. He could feel the power from her Ling Qi layer\u2026 So Liu Fei had broken through to the Ling Qi layer, no wonder that she wanted to fight with him again.Liu Fei was very young and had yet already broken through to the Ling Qi layer. She was a really outstanding talent. She was about as strong as Lin Qian and Na Lan Feng. Considering these things her arrogance would be inevitable, however she was not as vicious and petty as Lin Qian and did not look down on others like Na Lan Feng. Also her status was much higher than that of Lin Qian or Na Lan Feng. One could notice it from the moment she was seen with the cavalry troop which contained troops much stronger than the ones he had slaughtered during the night before the annual tournament.\u201cAs expected, Sword skills are indeed very powerful.\u201d Her arrows were much quicker than before. She had also become much stronger as well. Her arrows could even exceed the speed of sound as they ripped through the air. The whistling sound of the arrow could be heard only after the arrow had reached its target or maybe the sound would be heard after the arrow had already pierced its opponent. Killing people with these arrows would be extremely easy for her.Bow and arrow techniques were terrifying and Cultivators who used them were extremely respected. Their attacks were fast and precise while carrying extremely powerful destructive force.Unfortunately for her, Liu Fei\u2019s strength was still not extremely developed. It was incomparable with that of some extremely advanced Cultivators who used bows and arrows.\u201cYou\u2019re lucky.\u201d Liu Fei said to Lin Feng while looking at him. She put another arrow in the bow and said: \u201cI\u2019ll give you another chance.\u201d\u201cNo need. I am not guilty of anything. I don\u2019t need to apologize or to beg you.\u201d Lin Feng said while shaking his head. He started walking towards Liu Fei.\u201cYou\u2019re bringing about your own destruction.\u201d shouted Liu Fei furiously. An arrow then pierced through the air.\u201cEight Strikes of Desolation!\u201dLin Feng raised his hand and thrust out three strikes which collided with the arrow and with each strike it gradually lost strength until it eventually fell helpless onto the ground.\u201cEight Strikes of Desolation, Xuan level skill, Ling Qi layer\u2026\u201d Liu Fei thought while shivering in fear. When she saw that Lin Feng knew the skill Eight Strikes of Desolation, she understand that Lin Feng had also broken through to the Ling Qi layer. No wonder he had remained so insolent.She had realized her mistake, she immediately turned around and started running at an incredible speed in the opposite direction.Lin Feng was baffled and had no idea what she was doing. Then, he saw Liu Fei bending over, her body had a perfect arch shape. That beauty was still hiding her killing intent and she would not let go of her revenge so easily.\u201cWhooosh\u201dAn arrow shot through the air with a whistling sound but this time it was even faster and stronger than a moment ago.Lin Feng wasn\u2019t scared. He was as confident as before. He started his Eight Strikes of Desolation attack again. This time, he used four strikes.\u201cDamn, how many strikes can that guy do using Eight Strikes of Desolation?!\u201d Liu Fei whispered as she swore at Lin Feng in her heart. She suddenly released her spirit. A beautiful and resplendent Golden Arrow spirit appeared. It looked very different from the last time. This time, there were three arrows behind her back. Her spirit was emitting such a strong Qi that it made Lin Feng shake.Besides, Liu Fei\u2019s spirit had been awakened as expected.Liu Fei\u2019s arrow spirit flew up in the air and following it, Liu Fei also jumped in the air.High up in the air, the arrows were accurately aiming at Lin Feng. At the same time, Liu Fei was holding her silver bow and had loaded it with three arrows as well. Three cruel and deadly arrows.\u201cMeteor Fall.\u201dLiu Fei looked serene and calm. Her body floated high up in the air as six arrows were shot and pierced through the air.The arrow spirit definitely had great advantages. Not only was it able to automatically aim at somebody but it was also able to aim at a specific body part.At that moment, Lin Feng had the feeling that the arrow spirit was aiming at his soul which made him feel like his very being was being suppressed by the arrows.\u201cThese arrows are so powerful.\u201dLin Feng was feeling gloomy and immediately he started his Eight Strikes of Desolation attack using both hands. Fourteen strikes had blotted out the Sky and covered up the Earth. moving straight towards the incoming arrows.\u201cBOOM, BOOM,BOOM!\u201dExplosion sounds filled the air and an extremely strong wind blew onto Lin Feng\u2019s disciple robes.After these apocalyptic attacks vanished, Liu Fei appeared again in a cloud of dust. She was crouching down and was breathing heavily.\u201cHow can he be this strong?\u201d Liu Fei was looking at Lin Feng and wondering how she would get her revenge. It seemed impossible. She was completely astonished. After she broke through to the Ling Qi layer, her father himself had assisted her in her training. She had been practicing everyday with no rest. She had greatly increased her breathing abilities and her combat skills. She had greatly increased her strength and her attacks now contained explosive power within each arrow. Thanks to her spirit she was now even able to shoot six arrows at the same time.She was extremely talented as a disciple of the first Ling Qi layer and not many people could defeat her but Lin Feng was still able to block all of her attacks. She had lost once again and was unable to put up resistance.He was a genius. He could use up to seven strikes of the Eight Strikes of Desolation skill and up to fourteen using both hands. He had managed to master it with both hands to such a level, such a thing was impossible. Was he really only at the first Ling Qi layer? How could his attacks be that horrifyingly powerful?When Liu Fei saw that Lin Feng was moving nearer and nearer with a weird smile on his face, she could feel a shiver run down her spine and while remaining vigilant she asked him: \u201cWhat are you planning to do?\u201d\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201d Lin Feng said nothing and just hummed as if he was thinking of what he would do. What kind of girl was she? She often used that delicate, charming and tender expression to fool others. She also looked very cute but he knew that deep down she was violent. If Lin Feng didn\u2019t have a strong willpower and determination, he could have ended up falling for her too.Lin Feng whose expression was barely discernible looked at Liu Fei with an evil smile on his face and asked: \u201cWhat do you think that I am going to do\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d Liu Fei had the blood rush from her face and she looked incredibly pale. She took an arrow from her back\u2026 and started pressing it against her own throat. She was extremely determined.Lin Feng was joking on purpose and at that moment was astonished. He wouldn\u2019t have thought that his joke would have such repercussions. He couldn\u2019t help but be completely shocked.\u201cIf I wanted to do anything to you, do you think I would have let you off last time?\u201dLin Feng had no choice but to speak. Could it be that he really looked and sounded like a pervert?Lin Feng\u2019s words suddenly relieved Liu Fei. She also put down the arrow that she was holding.\u201cIf you really want this place then I will leave it to you. From this point forward we won\u2019t need to meet anymore, it\u2019s too troublesome with you. You continue to shock me.\u201d Lin Feng explained while walking towards Liu Fei. When he arrived next to her, he stopped.Lin Feng bent over and looked at Liu Fei. He slowly sighed amazed by the beautiful skin of the girls in that world.Lin Feng who was above Liu Fei looked closely and attentively at her delicate face. He looked startled. Then he smiled and whispered: \u201cI have only just realized now that you are pretty cute after all.\u201dWhen he finished talking, Lin Feng left.Liu Fei was astonished for a while but she soon came to her senses.\u201cAh\u2026 that bastard\u2026.\u201dLin Feng sensed the stones of the mountains around him were shaking and the sound of Liu Fei\u2019s voice was echoing through the atmosphere into his ears. There was no need to react that way. Holding a grudge against somebody like this wasn\u2019t a pleasant thing after all. It was even scary to a certain extent.\u201cI guess this settles things between us.\u201dLin Feng had a resplendent and brilliant smile on his face. He looked like a happy and well rounded young man. Always taking things too seriously or always being too worried was pointless. Sometimes it felt good to relax and not worry.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 - Mo Xie is EvilPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLin Feng had left the mountains where he had just finally removed a thorn from his side. He saw some silhouettes on the horizon running at full speed which created a dust storm behind them.\u201cHey, what\u2019s going on?\u201d asked a disciple who didn\u2019t understand what was going.\u201cYou still don\u2019t know? There are too many ferocious beasts in the Black Wind Mountain. It looks like oceans of ferocious beasts have emerged. A countless number of ferocious beasts have gone into a frenzy. All the Yun Hai Sect disciples are going there now to stop the disturbance.\u201d\u201cA flood of ferocious beasts\u2026?\u201d replied the other one looking really excited. They immediately headed towards the crowd at great speed, while heading towards the Black Wind Mountain.The history of the Yun Hai Sect dated back a thousand years but the history of the Black Wind Mountain was even older than that. These floods of ferocious beasts weren\u2019t a rare thing but for the great majority of them, they were weaker beasts. Many disciples were heading there for treasures and for battle experience. This was something which did not occur frequently and could not be missed.A few hundred years before, there was a flood of strong ferocious beasts, the Yun Hai Sect was almost destroyed by this flood. Ordinary ferocious beasts and Ling level ferocious beasts were not a problem, they were ordinary and easy to kill\u2026 but during the apocalyptic flood from the past, there was a gigantic quantity of Xuan level ferocious beats which were extremely strong compared to cultivators at the same level. They were incredibly hard to kill which made them extremely dangerous. They made earthquakes with their movements and killed a multitude of people. The sect was almost completely destroyed.There were also rumors, at that time the leader of the ferocious beasts was a mutant beast which could change its shape, a celestial ferocious beast.Because it had happened such a long time before the information that people knew about it was limited. However, everybody knew that these floods of ferocious beasts were very dangerous but that they were also a great opportunity.Cultivators would give their best efforts to obtain as many precious items as they could.Fighting against ferocious beasts would quickly increase the battle experience of the disciples.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought that the Yun Hai Sect disciples would go there before the elite disciple exam.\u201d Lin Feng thought. He then started walking and decided to head straight to the Black Wind Mountain.Lin Feng didn\u2019t walk for a very long time. Liu Fei also came out of the mountains and was also heading to the Black Wind Mountain.On the highest mountain of the Yun Hai Sect were sitting a group of mysterious people looking down at the surroundings. They were watching Ling Hu He Shan, the top ranked Core Disciple of the Yun Hai Sect.\u201cHow strong. It looks like this time the number of ferocious beasts is quite large.\u201cLing Hu is extremely strong as expected. He looks like one of the eight high officials of the country\u2026\u201d People thought while looking at Ling Hu He Shan\u2019s silhouette. They all knew that the high official, Chu Zhan Peng had come to the Yun Hai Sect. They had seen how arrogant he was. It had moved Ling Hu He Shan\u2019s heart a great deal and he had now placed orders to control who came in and out of the Yun Hai Sect.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The Black Wind Mountain looked like an apocalyptic battlefield. Sect Elders and disciples were moving together towards to the Black Wind Mountain.The entrance of the Black Wind Mountain was surrounded by the strongest Cultivators within the sect. The ferocious beasts were roaring loudly at the base of mountain. There were also many disciples killing ferocious beasts on the outskirts, it was a real bloodbath.At that moment, Elder Mo Xie was standing on a huge monolith, his long sleeves were fluttering in the air.\u201cElder Mo Xie, these disciples are quite strong. It looks like the ordinary disciples are all capable of advancing really quickly within the sect.\u201d said an Ordinary Elder standing next to Mo Xie.\u201cHaha, this is actually so easy for us to handle. There is no danger that we fear on this mountain. This is just a warm up before the elite disciple exam. It\u2019s quite fun actually.\u201dMo Xie laughed when saying this. He sounded like there was absolutely no ferocious beast flood where disciples were fighting to the death.\u201cElder Mo Xie, Elder Mo Xie\u2026.\u201dAt that moment, more and more people were gathering. They all came to Mo Xie and were bowing in front of him. They were extremely polite.At that moment, a silhouette passed by Mo Xie at full speed towards a ferocious beast.Mo Xie looked pale as if he had seen a ghost. There was a loud thunderous roar and suddenly a level eight ferocious beast died on the spot.The thunderous roars came from Lin Feng\u2019s sword. They were making the entire atmosphere vibrate heavily. He threw himself at wild enraged rhinoceros and smashed its head, then the beast collapsed and died.Lin Feng used his sword to remove the precious core and other valuable items while placing them in his bag. These precious items were extremely expensive and valuable for him. He would be able to exchange them within the sect for useful tools which would increase his strength and increase his cultivation.Mo Xie, who was still standing still on the huge monolith, couldn\u2019t help but feel like he had a weight placed on his heart when he saw Lin Feng. That was precisely that disciple who had made him lose face in the presence of many other people. He had really humiliated him in front of everyone. He would have never thought that Lin Feng could improve his sword skills to such an extent in such a short amount of time.\u201cYou have become quicker and stronger but you, an ordinary disciple, dared to humiliate me. You should just die.\u201d Thought Mo Xie full of hatred. He hadn\u2019t forgotten that day. The memory of those events were still fresh in his mind.\u201cSTOP.\u201d shouted Mo Xie while looking at Lin Feng. He sounded like a madman and his shout was filled with anger. He had shouted so loud that it surprised Lin Feng. He stopped what he was doing, turned around and saw Mo Xie.\u201cElder, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d asked Lin Feng.\u201cBastard, stop killing all the ferocious beasts! You\u2019re doing this only so that the others don\u2019t get the precious items, you selfish bastard. Good thing that I\u2019m here to pay attention and think about your fellow disciples of the Yun Hai Sect.\u201dMo Xie was still shouting with anger. There was someone standing next to Lin Feng. He was an Elder who followed Mo Xie. He was sent there by Mo Xie as he could easily kill Lin Feng with a flick of his wrist.\u201cElder, I don\u2019t see what precious items you are talking about.\u201d said Lin Feng while smiling coldly. Last time, Mo Xie had put Lin Feng in an almost fatal position. It was a death trap. He wanted to hand Lin Feng over to Chu Zhan Peng. Lin Feng wouldn\u2019t have thought that Mo Xie would still hate him though. Lin Feng had never directly offended him. Mo Xie had been wrong to try and frame Lin Feng. He thought this Elder had already learnt his lesson\u201d\u201cBastard, how dare you talk to an Elder that way?\u201d shouted the Elder standing next to Lin Feng. He sounded furious.That Elder wasn\u2019t weak and had relied on Mo Xie to become an Elder. Of course, he wasn\u2019t going to miss an opportunity to show in front of his benefactor.\u201cI\u2019m saying that you stole the precious items, do I need to repeat it once again?\u201d said Mo Xie smiling coldly. Lin Feng wasn\u2019t doing it on purpose. It was easy to misunderstand though. Mo Xie was once again accusing Lin Feng of made up crimes and then everybody would attempt to kill Lin Feng on the spot.If Lin Feng died, who would say anything? He was just an ordinary disciple. Two Elders were there as witnesses. Two Elders in charge of enforcing the rules within the sect. There would be nothing strange if they killed Lin Feng.\u201cLittle Boy, be very careful, will you dare humiliate an Elder?\u201d Said Mo Xie ad he was laughing on the inside. In his head, Lin Feng was already dead.\u201cYou really are a shameless Elder.\u201d Lin Feng cursed loudly. He had first accused Lin Feng of stealing items from the others and then started adding other crimes to the list. Mo Xie was in charge of enforcing the rules in the Sect\u2026 How could he abuse his power like this? Even if some others didn\u2019t agree, they would protect Lin Feng if he was having issues with an Elder\u2026 and Mo Xie was trying to create a conflict between Lin Feng and the other Elder.Lin Feng had no way to defend himself. If an Elder said he had committed a crime, then he had committed a crime.\u201cMo Xie, I know you want to kill me. You don\u2019t need to invent false crimes to accuse me. Just admit it honestly, like someone with a backbone.\u201dLin Feng looked at Mo Xie and smiled coldly. He sounded extremely self confident and arrogant.\u201cHuh?\u201d Mo Xie frowned. Lin Feng dared be that impertinent?\u201c\u201dMo Xie, I am just an ordinary disciple. You are an Elder, what are you afraid of? If you want to kill me, then go ahead and try to kill me. I am right here waiting for you.\u201dLin Feng saw that Mo Xie was frowning and continued to talk. He didn\u2019t restrain himself at all. He didn\u2019t care about Mo Xie and continued to humiliate him.\u201cNo wonder\u2026\u201d Mo Xie remembered that day. He had been extremely scared of the shadow which took hold of him when he attempted to attack Lin Feng.Indeed, that shadow had protected Lin Feng during those events. How could Mo Xie be sure that the shadow wouldn\u2019t protect Lin Feng again? Was Lin Feng was not acting this way to make him attack so the shadow would act?He remembered that frightening shadow as it completely dominated his body. Mo Xie couldn\u2019t help being terrified at the thought. He was clearly trembling in fear.He looked at Lin Feng with an evil look. Lin Feng looked back while remaining insolent and not scared at all.\u201cHe Chong, let\u2019s go, help me capture him.\u201d Said Mo Xie to He Chong who was standing near Lin feng. He didn\u2019t say \u201ckill\u201d, only \u201ccapture\u201d.\u201cAlright.\u201d replied He Chong.\u201cAsshole.\u201d Lin Feng said while glancing at He Chong. The insult had spontaneously burst forth from his mouth. It was completely unexpected by the people watching from the sidelines.\u201cWhat did you say???\u201d said He Chong growing extremely furious. An ordinary disciple had suddenly dared insult him in front of the entire crowd, that was ridiculous absurd, impossible. That was truly outrageous.\u201cMo Xie doesn\u2019t dare to touch me and wants you to attack me, haven\u2019t you thought of the consequences?\u201dLin Feng was smiling coldly while looking at He Chond and then added: \u201cI\u2019m not just insulting you though. The same also applies Mo Xie. He abuses his power as an Elder. When you look at Mo Xie trembling in fear, Are you sure that you still feel like attacking me?\u201d\u201cMo Xie doesn\u2019t dare attack me. He wants you to do it, you\u2019re a scapegoat and you\u2019re even excited to obey his orders. Even if I say you are an asshole, am I wrong with what I say?\u201dLin Feng\u2019s tone was cold but calm. It made He Chong furious. He didn\u2019t hesitate and immediately started moving towards Lin Feng.He secretly glanced at Mo Xie and saw Mo Xie was extremely furious as well but as before, he was not moving towards Lin Feng at all. It was incredibly strange.\u201cMo Xie is extremely strong and influential. Does he want me to act as a scapegoat?\u201d He Chong thought. He thought about the conversation Mo Xie and Lin Feng had had. The more he thought about it, the more he thought Lin Feng could be right. Besides, Mo Xie\u2019s father was standing behind them, so if something happened then Mo Xie would be helped by his father. However, if something happened to He Chong, who would protect him?At that moment, a large group of Yun Hai Sect disciples were surrounding them and had seen everything. They couldn\u2019t help but be stupefied. An ordinary disciple had only said a few words and had terrified two Elders of the Yun Hai Sect.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 - Imaginary DemonPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cI tell you to hurry up and kill me but you still don\u2019t dare, what sort of Sect Elders are you?\u201d said Lin Feng sneering at the, then he turned around and beheaded a sly python with his sword. His sword was extremely sharp and precise.Lin Feng had an evil smile on his face which made He Chong even more hesitant to attack. He surprisingly already believed Lin Feng\u2019s words and did not want to act rashly. Mo Xie didn\u2019t dare take risks either so both elders were frozen in place, unmoving. The last time he made a move against Lin Feng, the evil shadow had defended him and had scared Mo Xie to death. Even just thinking about the shadow sent chills down his spine. It had been a deep psychological trauma for Mo Xie.The flood of ferocious beasts was getting more and more intense. There were also more and more disciples who were joining in the fights. Each of them looked crueler than the other rushing into the multitude of ferocious beasts which actually gave the impression they were bloodthirsty beasts themselves.Liu Fei had also arrived. She saw that Lin Feng was in the middle of all these ferocious beasts and that it seemed easy for him to kill them. His sword was bathed in blood and rivers of blood flowed under his feet. Lin Feng wasn\u2019t using his full strength so it was hard to tell he was at the Ling Qi layer. He was using the strength of the ninth Qi layer to kill the incoming ferocious beasts. However every movement of his sword was precise, powerful, accurate and quick. His swordsmanship was on a whole new level.Lin Feng had complete control when using his sword and every movement was perfection. He was quick, accurate and powerful. People were unable to tell how powerful Lin Feng was but they knew he must be strong.\u201cThis damned guy again\u2026\u201d Liu Fei insulted Lin Feng in her thoughts. She took her bow and arrow from her back and immediately shot an arrow through the skull of a ferocious beast that Lin Feng was about to kill.Lin Feng turned around and saw Liu Fei\u2019s ice cold eyes glaring at him. He smiled at her in a friendly way and ignored her killing the ferocious beast. He believed their debt had been settled already.\u201cRaaawwwwwwrrrr.\u201d a furious roar spread throughout the atmosphere and echoed through the air. The ground started violently shaking. Everyone had the impression the ground was collapsing under their feet. Everyone\u2019s face suddenly became much more serious than before.\u201cAn extremely powerful ferocious beast is coming.\u201dMany people started moving back scared of the ferocious beast which was heading in their direction. A black fog was filling the air in a distant location and was gradually moving nearer. The crowd could just see the fog moving forward and trees getting split into pieces and blown away.\u201cHow scary!\u201dThe crowd was still retreating backwards. That kind of monstrous power must be at least at the Ling level of ferocious beasts. If an ordinary disciple went to try to kill it then they would certainly die.When Lin Feng noticed that such a powerful ferocious beast was approaching, he started retreating as well. He wasn\u2019t confident that he could easily kill such a powerful ferocious beast. Until that moment, he had been killing only low level ones and had never engaged in battle with a ferocious beast of the Ling Level.While Lin Feng kept retreating backwards, a sudden oppressive force crashed onto his body. That oppressive force made his body go completely stiff and started to push him forwards and prevented him from moving back.\u201cAnimal!\u201d Lin Feng shouted furiously looking at Mo Xie who was behind him. He didn\u2019t need to ask himself who was doing this to him, it was obvious that only Elder Mo Xie was able to do that, especially with such strength. He didn\u2019t dare attack him so he just prevented him from retreating away from danger.Mo Xie turned a deaf ear to Lin Feng\u2019s insults. He had an evil smile across his face. He had been humiliated by that worthless ordinary disciple a few times, he had completely lost face. But more and more he started to think that he was wrong about the shadow which was supporting Lin Feng. How was that possible that the possessor of that Shadow Spirit was always with Lin Feng? Besides, he had just looked around carefully and had seen no shadow at all. He had decided that if he was going to act, now would be the best chance.Of course, Mo Xie wasn\u2019t absolutely convinced that the shadow wasn\u2019t in the area. Therefore, he had only tried to harm Lin Feng using sly and indirect methods. He would have the rampaging beast kill Lin Feng for himThe extremely powerful ferocious beast was moving nearer and it seemed like there was an earthquake every time it moved. The crowd could only see a black fog filling the air. Around that black fog, there was a large group of extremely strong ferocious wild beasts. Each of them diffused such a strong Qi that the disciples who saw had felt their hearts jumping from their chests.\u201cHe\u2019s dead. Elder Mo Xie willingly put him in such a situation. He\u2019s definitely screwed.\u201dEverybody was running back and saw that Lin Feng was alone unable to move backwards in retreat. Mo Xie was also standing away from the crowd and had firmly placed himself behind Lin Feng. The crowd had clearly understood what was going on. They couldn\u2019t help but insult Lin Feng for his foolishness. They didn\u2019t understand what the situation was actually about. This was the result for insulting an Elder of the Sect.\u201cThat ferocious beast is extremely powerful. If you force me into fighting it then I will most likely die in an instant\u201d said Lin Feng who was still oppressed and shouted furiously. He wanted to go back but Mo Xie had blocked him.\u201cPfff, it seems like this time the Shadow Spirit isn\u2019t with him.\u201d Mo Xie thought cruelly. Then, he said loudly: \u201cAbandoning others before a large battle, this disciple is the shame of the Yun Hai Sect.\u201dWhen Mo Xie finished talking, an extremely thick vine suddenly burst out of his body threw itself at Lin Feng at an incredible speed.Lin Feng body was burning under the pressure of the force that was oppressing him and in the blink of an eye, he was then constricted by thick vine plants which surrounding his body. It had moved extremely quick and looked like a Boa. At that moment, Lin Feng was absolutely unable to move.\u201cSpirit\u2026 It\u2019s his spirit. Mo Xie has a Boa Vine Spirit!\u201dThe crowd was shaking with roars of surprise. It looked like Mo Xie was determined to make sure that Lin Feng would fall into that death trap and die. If an ordinary disciple actually dared confront an Elder of the Sect, he was doomed.However, there were some people who didn\u2019t really agree with such a thing. They thought it wasn\u2019t fair to attempt killing an ordinary disciple, especially when the one attempting to murder them was a powerful Elder in the Sect. They thought that it was quite shameless for Mo Xie to act as he did but nobody would dare to say anything. Who would dare to provoke Mo Xie?Lin Feng howled furiously. His sword was glowing but it was constricted by the thick Boa Vine Spirit like the rest of his body. There was nothing that he was able to move.Even though Lin Feng was a genius who was extraordinary and could definitely easily defeat cultivators of the same level or even of a much higher level than him, he was unable to defeat Mo Xie who was an Elder of the Yun Hai Sect. The gap between the two was gigantic. At that moment, Lin Feng was powerless.\u201cImpressive for an Elder to bully a disciple\u2026 you\u2019re really shameless.At that moment, an ice cold voice shouting was heard. Everybody in the crowd was surprised and stupefied. Surprisingly, the one who had said that was\u2026 Liu Fei. The beautiful Liu Fei\u2026 who was desired by an incredibly huge amount of sect disciples.\u201cHuh??\u201d Mo Xie frowned and looked at Liu Fei. He groaned but he didn\u2019t dare attack Liu Fei either. He knew Liu Fei\u2019s status and background. The funny thing is that Mo Xie\u2019s father, Mo Cang Lan had the same name as Liu Fei\u2019s father, Liu Cang Lan. But Liu Cang Lan was of course much more popular and famous than Mo Cang Lan. Everybody knew the stories Liu Cang Lan in the Yun Hai Sect. Mo Xie\u2019s father paled in comparison.The bow wielding genius, Liu Cang Lan and the Patriarch of the Sect, Nan Gong Ling were extremely arrogant yet popular when they were young. They cared a lot about their fellow disciples in the sect. They were both the best cultivators within the Sect, they were geniuses. Their friendship was also very deep and sincere, they were truly like brothers.Liu Fei released her spirit and grabbed her silver bow from her back. She prepared three arrows in addition of the three arrows of her spirit and aimed at the Boa Vine Spirit.Liu Cang Lan was extremely strong. Liu Fei envied her father\u2019s strength and power. Even though she bitterly hated Lin Feng, she couldn\u2019t bear the sight that was happening in front of her. Mo Xie was a very tiny personage, shameless and disgusting.Liu Fei didn\u2019t know if that attack was going to be of any use but she still tried. As before, the Boa Vine Spirit didn\u2019t move at all.Lin Feng looked amused for a second. He wouldn\u2019t have thought that Liu Fei would surprisingly be the one trying to help him in the last moments of his life.\u201cI have taken useless risks. I was too negligent. It\u2019s my fault.\u201d thought Lin Feng depressed. He wouldn\u2019t have thought that he would come across Mo Xie and he had even less expected that Mo Xie would do such an evil and shameless thing.Besides, at that moment, Mo Xie was much stronger than him so nobody was helping him. Liu Fei was an exception but she wasn\u2019t strong enough. She tried to help but in vain.\u201cRRAAAAWWWRRRR\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d The roar of the ferocious beast sounded violent and fierce. The beasts around it were also extremely quick, but there was still that gigantic black fog to be careful about. Nothing could resist it. The gigantic black fog was swallowing everything on its way through the forest. It was extremely strong, unimaginably powerful.\u201cIt\u2019s so strong! It must be an Imaginary Demon! It\u2019s at least level seven!\u201d Mo Xie could sense that terrifying power getting nearer and nearer. That monster was at the seventh Ling level which meant that it had the strength of a cultivator of the seventh Ling Qi layer. That strength was coupled with its natural strength as a ferocious beast which meant he was even more powerful than a cultivator of the seventh Ling Qi layer. Cultivators had to practice to acquire a basic strength whereas beasts already had a natural born strength which was added their level.Mo Xie was observing Lin Feng and looking forward to seeing him die.\u201cMo Xie, you bastard!\u201d shouted an extremely loud voice which seemed to be thundering through the air. The person to whom the voice belonged was nowhere in sight.Mo Xie\u2019s face immediately changed into a look of disbelief. His Boa Vine spirit suddenly released Lin Feng and surprisingly went towards the group of ferocious beasts.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 - The Strange MetamorphosisPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHow dare you!\u201d shouted an extremely loud voice which made the ground tremble. That extremely violent and furious shout terrified the entire crowd. They were all trying to guess to whom that voice belonged and who could be that powerful within the sect.There was a flying crane which appeared in the air above then transformed into a bright light. Its light was so blinding that the light from the sun was completely blotted out. The light immediately began attacking the ferocious beasts.It seemed like these ferocious beasts could sense that the person who had arrived was insanely powerful. They all started neighing, roaring and emitting other noises but that Imaginary Demon didn\u2019t seem to be affected as much. Lin Feng was about to get absorbed by that black fog when the Imaginary Demon suddenly rolled away as if he was suddenly trying to escape.Ferocious beasts of the Ling Level were not only able to absorb the Qi of Heaven and Earth but they were also very intelligent. They could feel and sense forces as well as powerful energies. It seemed like the imaginary demon had been affected by the force and energy emanating from the crane, which made it want to escape.The wings of the crane starting emitting a brilliant and dazzling silver light. It then immediately flew through the crowd of ferocious beasts and suddenly, a river of blood seemed to be flowing down the mountain.These terrifyingly strong and powerful ferocious beasts had surprisingly been defeated by the mysterious person. The possessor of crane spirit was extremely powerful. It was impossible to judge exactly how powerful he was.After all these ferocious wild beasts were destroyed, the black fog of that Imaginary Demon started dispersing through the atmosphere and turned into grey ashes. Lin Feng had vanished.\u201cImaginary Demon\u2026 as expected, it\u2019s power is incredible.\u201dSome people in the crowed thought while looking at the Imaginary Demon. It was turning into a multitude of smaller Imaginary Demons. It didn\u2019t have a real body. Even if you were stronger than an Imaginary Demon, it was still very hard to catch.Suddenly, the wings of the crane started shaking very violently which created a hurricane. Everybody in the crowd was falling down onto the ground from the pressure. Right after, the crane flew away and disappeared leaving behind a massive amount of dead ferocious beasts lying down on the ground.How strong! Everybody was speechless.Chu Zhan Peng who had come to the Yun Hai Sect not so long before was also able to fly and had a Legendary Roc Spirit. Even though he had similar skills and was also extremely strong, in comparison with this Crane Spirit, Chu Zhan Peng was a weakling. In a fight between the Legendary Roc and the Crane, the Legendary Roc would not be able to withstand a single blow.A great majority of the people who were present had never seen such a strength before. They were very excited. They were wondering who that person was and how he was related to the sect. He was so strong that not a single ferocious beast could have given him a hard time.\u201cOur Sect has existed for about a thousand years. We are really the Sect of the millennium\u2026 even in periods of great prosperity, there are always hidden cultivators of amazing strength which have hidden amongst us.\u201dEverybody was extremely excited after watching such a display of power. They all hoped that one day they would have the chance to become that strong.At that moment, two people were moving through the sky. Even though their agility abilities were extremely developed, they were moving through the sky in a way which gave the impression it was an easy thing for everyone to do. These two people were surprisingly the Patriarch Nan Gong Ling followed by Mo Cang Lan.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d asked Nan Gong Ling while falling from the sky onto the ground before landing in front of Mo Xie.\u201cMo Xie has been trying to kill one of our disciples. He pushed him towards the ferocious beasts so that he would get slaughtered by the monsters.\u201d said someone who was standing next to Liu Fei, whose eyes were filled with hatred.Liu Fei hated Lin Feng but she hoped that she could become strong enough someday to regain her dignity and defeat Lin Feng. She didn\u2019t like to see Lin Feng treated in such an unjust way. Lin Feng was a real genius, he was even stronger than her and no one could treat him that way. Lin Feng could become a pillar of the Yun Hai Sect. Liu Fei was sad to see an Elder treat Lin Feng that way.\u201cPatriarch, this is untrue. There is one ordinary disciple who was killing all the ferocious beasts and stealing all the precious items. Then, when the stronger ones arrived, he deserted. Damn him!\u201d said Mo Xie who was, obviously, not going to admit what he had done. Lin Feng was already dead anyway. Even if he didn\u2019t admit that he had killed Lin Feng, who would say anything?\u201cAlright, today, you clearly wish to die today!\u201dAn extremely loud and aggressive voice emerged. A hurricane was rolling through the air blowing almost everyone away and no one was able to stand steadily on their feet.Mo Xie\u2019s face changed drastically. A terrifyingly powerful Qi appeared and was surrounded by a radiant light. It then flew threw the air and crashed into Mo Xie\u2019s body.\u201cBOOM! BOOOM! BOOOOM!.\u201dThe rock on which Mo Xie currently standing exploded into a thousand pieces and Mo Xie\u2019s mouth spurted blood like a fountain. That single attack was extremely powerful.The Elder Mo Xie had been defeated in a single strike, he was bleeding endlessly and all of this was done in the presence of his father, Mo Cang Lan.The crowd had the impression they were watching a dream. They couldn\u2019t believe that it was really happening before their eyes.Then, the crowd looked again to see who had done that attack and saw an old man. Everybody recognized him.\u201cHuh? That\u2019s the old man who is the entrance guard of the Xing Chen Pavilion.\u201dEverybody was stunned. As a disciple of the Yun Hai Sect, everybody had already been to the Xing Chen Pavilion. It had to be the old man. Who couldn\u2019t recognize Protector Bei?They were not used to seeing him like this though. They were used to seeing him looking almost asleep or lazy at the entrance of the Xing Chen Pavilion. They would have never imagined that he could be so monstrously strong.At that moment, Protector Bei\u2019s eyes were filled with murderous intentions and he was moving slowly towards Mo Xie. He then said in an ice cold tone: \u201cYou\u2019re an Elder of the Yun Hai Sect in charge of enforcing the sect rules and yet you dare to kill a young disciple, a junior, of the Sect\u2026? If I don\u2019t kill you, it means that the sect holds no place in my heart.\u201dMo Xie\u2019s face was deathly pale. He wouldn\u2019t have thought that, suddenly, someone would kill him just because of a simple disciple.A silhouette appeared before Mo Xie and seemed to be vigilant. It was precisely Mo Cang Lan.\u201cProtector Bei, don\u2019t you think that you are exaggerating a little bit?\u201d\u201cExaggerating? Mo Cang Lan, have you not educated your son.\u201d said Protector Bei extremely sharply which made Mo Cang Lan completely lose face. He then shouted: \u201cGet the hell away!\u201d\u201cProtector Bei, do you have to be this furious?\u201d asked Nan Gong Ling who came in front of Protector Bei at the same time.Nan Gong Ling, of course, knew what kind of person Mo Xie was but when it came to the sect, he was still an important person. Besides, there was still Mo Cang Lan. He was extremely strong and in charge of the elders. Therefore, attacking Mo Xie would cause trouble amongst those standing at the top within the Sect.\u201cPatriarch, let me handle this business, I am about clean up the Sect today.\u201d said Protector Bei ignoring everything which had been said until that moment. He regarded Lin Feng as the bright future of the sect. He thought Lin Feng was a gift bestowed upon his sect by the gods\u2026 and Mo Xie had fed him to the ferocious beasts.\u201cProtector Bei!!!!\u201d shouted Nan Gong Ling extremely loud attempting to make Protector Bei regain his calm.\u201cDon\u2019t kill Mo Xie, think about the sect above all!\u201d said Nan Gong Ling to Protector Bei.\u201cThink about the sect above all?!\u201d said Protector Bei with a sort of smile on his face. He thought that killing Mo Xie was particularly important for the sake of the sect.\u201cNan Gong, do you know who that young man was?\u201dProtector wasn\u2019t shouting anymore. His voice was low and sounded it was filled with emotions.Nan Gong Ling was stupefied. He had no idea, there were so many young disciples in the Sect.\u201cIf Protector Kong was here today, Mo Xie would be dead already!\u201d said Protector Bei. That sentence was filled with meaning. His eyes were filled with pain and sorrow, he then said: \u201cThink about the Sect first\u2026 Nan Gong\u2026 In your life as Patriarch\u2026 We will never be blessed with a talent like that again\u2026 \u201dWhen he finished talking, Protector Bei transformed into a Crane again and suddenly vanished leaving a hurricane behind him.\u201cProtector Kong\u2026\u201d Nan Gong Ling couldn\u2019t believe he had heard the old man pronounce that name. He was shaking from head to toe. Nan Gong Ling obviously remembered and understood everything. That shadow which had protected Lin Feng last time was precisely Protector Kong\u2019s spirit. He had protected Lin Feng. He then remembered the eight sounds of drums from the Precipice of Zhangu which had filled the entire atmosphere of the Yun Hai sect.\u201cBOOM\u201d Nan Gong Ling\u2019s heart started pounding, his thoughts were flowing at full speed. He was getting more and more furious. He was starting to find himself being overwhelmed with murderous thoughts.\u201cMo Xie!!\u201dMo Cang Lan could feel that the Patriarch wanted to kill his son and that he was growing furious. What had happened? What had Protector Bei told Nan Gong Ling?Mo Cang Lan glanced at Mo Xie. That bastard of a son\u2019s behavior was really worse and worse. He was insolent and acted selfishly and relentlessly without thinking.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Lin Feng had been wrapped up in that black fog and immediately after he had had gone through a mystical event. It had seemed like his body had been transported through the universe. He didn\u2019t know where he had landed.An extremely cold Qi started to oppress his body and to dig into his flesh and bones. He wanted to struggle but he didn\u2019t know what or how to fight against this QiHe realized he was extremely weak in comparison.When confronted with death, Lin Feng released his twin spirits. His eyes became pitch black and he became aware of all the universe that was surrounding him. However, as before, he was immersed in a world of darkness.\u201cCelestial Spirit.\u201dLin Feng said in a low voice. A brilliant and resplendent light appeared. It was dazzling and mystical. Lin Feng suddenly saw two piercing cold eyes of a ferocious beast which was staring at him as if he was a prey.\u201cWhat\u2019s that? Is that a real ferocious beast?\u201d Lin Feng saw cruel eyes and a hideous face. It looked truly horrible.Many tentacles were approaching him as if they wanted to wrap themselves around him. At the same time, a tentacle had touched his spirit. His strange small snake spirit as well as his celestial spirit were being swallowed.Lin Feng was feeling so weak that he even thought that some of his vitality was slowly being consumed as well.At that moment, something very strange happened to Lin Feng.Something that had never happened before happened. His small snake spirit had moved for the first time, the snake was starting to move!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That small snake was becoming full of black fog.His snake spirit continued to swallow the black fog. The more it ate black fog, the bigger it grew. It was gradually growing larger and larger.Tentacles started to move towards the snake but it didn\u2019t have any effect on the snake spirit. Strangely, the snake was swallowing them as well. Lin Feng was astonished. His snake spirit was consuming everything.Lin Feng had been utterly helpless when facing the ferocious beast of the Ling layer and thought he was about to die. He would have never thought that his small un-awakened spirit, which was the reason for his nickname as \u201ctrash\u201d would start moving so suddenly.There was something strange about the ferocious dark eyes as if there was something wrong. There was a small twinkle which appeared in the eyes which were half filled with worry.Then a formation of dark tentacles and the black fog started to move away but the snake threw itself towards them.\u201cRrraawwww\u2026.\u201dLin Feng was utterly stupefied. His snake spirit looked excited. It opened its huge and ferocious mouth. Inside, there were a multitude of tentacles and black fog in the process of being swallowed.It was not enough for his snake spirit. The previously little snake was growing bigger and bigger. From an initial size of a third of a meter, it had grown to a meter in length. It seemed like it was a gluttonous snake trying to consume the world.The Imaginary Demon groaned and roared as it was fighting against the snake but its body was still being gradually eaten by the snake spirit.The Imaginary Demon released Lin Feng and the black fog slowly disappeared.\u201cRawwwrrrr\u2026..\u201d the snake made the same sound as the Imaginary Demon had made. It then swallowed as much black fog as it could and went back to Lin Feng\u2019s side.The snake spirit had become small again but was still much bigger than before. Then it rolled itself around Lin Feng\u2019s shoulder and fell asleep.\u201cIt swallowed the imaginary demon?\u201dLin Feng\u2019s eyes were wide open with shock. The black fog of the Imaginary Demon had completely disappeared without trace.That\u2019s\u2026 That was\u2026..The trash spirit\u2026?Lin Feng was speechless. At that moment, he had the sensation an immense strength was invading his body and a loud buzzing noise was resonating in his brain. He felt his vision grow blurry and he collapsed, completely losing consciousness.Lin Feng didn\u2019t know how much time had passed when he regained consciousness. When he opened his eyes, he was in a cave. It looked like that of a ferocious beast.\u201cBOOM!\u201dSuddenly, Lin Feng\u2019s body seemed like it was being crushed which terrified him. Panic filled his face and he felt pain that was indescribable.His heart was pounding. His dark spirit appeared along with his celestial spirit and suddenly, his mind began to become clear and undisturbed. His Celestial Spirit was also floating before his eyes in the form of a book.Immediately after, the small snake spirit also appeared. It was about one meter in length. Its body was becoming more solid and rigid. As before, it was still small and looked like it was asleep curled around Lin Feng\u2019s shoulder. It looked like it had a lot of affection for Lin Feng. From a glance they seemed to be very close and looked to have a deep connection.He had awakened his snake spirit!Something extraordinary happened which made Lin Feng tremble from head to toe. On his back a face had appeared. It had two ice cold, pitch black eyes.\u201cImaginary Demon\u2026\u201dLin Feng was still shaking and still trying to understand what had happened. How was this possible? At the moment when he had been swallowed by the Imaginary Demon, his snake spirit had suddenly appeared.A third spirit!?!Multiple spirits??\u2026 He was a real genius. He was truly gifted from the gods\u2026 On the continent, there was almost nobody who experienced such a thing. Out of a million of people, there was maybe one to who happened to have two spirits. Surprisingly, Lin Feng even had three. Was he a supernatural existence? A god?Three spirits. He would be able to terrify everyone at the mere mention of it. He would scare his enemies to death.There was an unceasing milky-white light circulating in and out of his body. It seemed to be the powerful Qi from heaven and earth. It was encircling him and circulating through his body.\u201cDid I just break through to the second Ling Qi layer?Lin Feng\u2019s brain was somehow short circuited with the shock of all these events. Even if he had released his spirit and was still able to remain calm to a certain extent, it was hard not to get excited considering the circumstances and the terrifying power of the things happening within his body.Lin Feng was using all off his mental focus to try and understand all the things that had occurred.\u201cIt looks like that small snake is able to swallow ferocious beasts and enables me to use them and their power. It also seems like it is able to absorb them into itself and use them to increase my strength.\u201dLin Feng was just conjecturing what was happening but a smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.Trash spirit?People laughed at him because they thought his spirit was useless but it was actually extremely powerful. If all those people who constantly laughed at him, bullied him and called him a piece of trash because of spirit, knew that he had such a powerful ability granted from his snake spirit, how would they react?\u201cDamn, I only narrowly climbed from my own grave. I have escaped from the pit and this will be the end of all the hardships I have suffered until now.\u201dLin Feng recalled his spirits back into his body. He looked up to the sky and uttered a long cry. He didn\u2019t know where he was at that moment though. He could only analyze the situation considering all of his past experiences and knowledge.\u201cCelestial Fangs. These Fangs can devour anything. That\u2019s a good name.\u201d Lin Feng whispered. That\u2019s the best name Lin Feng could think of to refer to his spirit, to that small snake. Celestial Fangs.\u201cMo Xie. If I don\u2019t kill you, I swear, I will make your life not worth living or my name is not Lin Feng.\u201dLin Feng stood up and his eyes filled with incredible killing intent.Lin Feng took a deep breath and as he did, the air in his throat tasted filthy. It tasted like a ferocious beast.Lin Feng looked carefully around him and it seemed like he was in the cave of a ferocious beast which made him feel extremely uncomfortable and nervous.Lin Feng quickly moved outside of the cave. Outside was a huge forest. Its trees were crushed into pieces. It seemed like its trees had been crushed by ferocious beasts that had trampled through the area. The smell of ferocious beasts still filled the air. He could even sense the ground shake under his feet at times. He could hear them roar and neigh in the distance.It seems like the flood of ferocious beasts hasn\u2019t stopped.Lin Feng had just encountered a large group of ferocious beasts where the Imaginary Demon was, but he knew that there were still other groups filled with extremely powerful ferocious beasts. The Black Wind Mountain was full of extremely strong ferocious beasts.He released his dark spirit. His eyes became pitch black. His sense of hearing and his vision became extremely well developed. He could see and sense everything in his surroundings. His brain was also processing all the data it received very quickly. It was as if he could sense and understand the whole area around him, as if he was looking down on a strategy map.At the same time, the strong Qi of ferocious beasts was revolving around Lin Feng\u2019s feet on the ground. It had started enveloping Lin Feng\u2019s body until it completely covered it. Lin Feng entered into a transcendent state of mind. Wrapped inside that Qi, it became impossible to see Lin Feng from the outside.It was the Imaginary Demon which had given Lin Feng its power. That Imaginary Demon was extremely powerful and its impression was enhanced. This was why it was impossible to see the Imaginary Demons real body. It was just a gigantic black fog as far as anyone could see. Lin Feng, thanks to his spirit consuming the Imaginary Demon, now had that ability too. The Imaginary Demon\u2019s skill was imprinted onto Lin Feng\u2019s mind and could be used naturally.In the Black Wind Mountain, there was an incredible amount of ferocious beasts. They were not only in one place but were everywhere in the territory. Because some ferocious beasts were extremely strong, Lin Feng had to be very careful. He could use his Qi to pretend he was a ferocious beast himself thanks to his new ability.These ferocious beasts were running madly everywhere in the Black Wind Mountain. As the number of ferocious beasts had greatly increased, they were running towards the outskirts as if trying to conquer new territory.At that moment, the Qi which surrounding Lin Feng really seemed to be that of a ferocious beast. Lin Feng started to walk.Some small and weak ferocious beasts passed by Lin Feng. Surprisingly, all these small ferocious beasts emitted small and cute sounds indicating that they were submitting themselves to him. The world of the ferocious beasts was even rougher than that of cultivators. It was ruled by the law of the jungle: The weak would become the food for the strong.Even some Ling level ferocious beasts were running away when they sensed Lin Feng\u2019s presence. Adult ferocious beasts of the Ling Level were at least level five which was quite terrifying. However, ordinary ferocious beasts of the Ling level could not compare themselves to the Imaginary Demon.\u201cThe depths of the Black Wind Mountain are really frightening.\u201dLin Feng realized how terrifying the depths of the Black Wind Mountain were and he couldn\u2019t help but think about before, when he was still at the Qi layer and dared come here without being scared at all. How ignorant was he? If they had met any of the ferocious beasts of the Ling level, they probably would have died.Of course, in the eyes of a ferocious beast of the Ling level, a Cultivator of the Qi layer was like an ant. Maybe these ferocious beasts wouldn\u2019t even have looked at them just like Lin Feng looks at ordinary low level ferocious beasts.\u201cThis is a great opportunity, why am I not hunting and killing ferocious beasts to gather precious items?\u201dLin Feng started being both nervous and excited. Ling Level ferocious beasts were not like ordinary ones. They could absorb the Qi of the earth and the precious items he could get from them were extremely valuable. If he gave these items to the Elders within the sect to trade, they could produce profound pills or weapons for the Ling Qi layer. Besides, some of the energies these ferocious beasts absorbed were also extremely useful in increasing a person\u2019s cultivation.Good Profound healing pills could cure injuries, including broken bones\u2026 It was even said that some pills could resurrect the dead.Good weapons could help greatly enhance one\u2019s attack and defense skills in battle.All of these items could be acquired and bought in exchange for precious items recovered from these ferocious beasts. This is why so many people took the risks to travel here and kill ferocious beasts. They wanted to acquire precious items to trade.Lin Feng had the feeling that he was far too poor. Apart from the soft sword, which was given to him by Protector Bei and the profound healing pills which Protector Kong had given to him, he actually had nothing of value. He had indeed never taken the time to consider his wealth and equipment.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 - Deadly SwordPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 64: Deadly Sword\u201cSome people have a high status in society and do not have to worry for money. It\u2019s also possible to use some profound pills to increase one\u2019s strength and move up in the hierarchy. I could use profound pills and trade for better weapons to increase my strength. As far as I am concerned, I do not have an influential background and I can only rely on my own strength.\u201d thought Lin Feng.His future on the path of cultivation was too important to him. There were many commitments he had in this life. If Lin Feng wanted to succeed, he had to put in more effort than anyone else. Effort was not all he needed though, some luck was also necessary. He also needed people supporting him if he wanted to advance quickly. It seemed like life was going to be full of hardships. In life there would be a great deal of injustice, not everyone and everything could be partial and fair. However to someone who put in more work than anyone else it would eventually show its rewards and eventually make life easier.If your natural abilities were too low, hard work coupled with perseverance and willpower, could be enough to lead a luxurious and comfortable life.However, not only were Lin Feng\u2019s natural abilities not low, he was an incredible genius with latent potential hidden within his body. Since this was the case, how could he not acquire great power and wealth to one day live a comfortable life?While thinking of all these things, Lin Feng started moving. Not so long after, he encountered an Abominable Rhinoceros eating a small ferocious beast. There was blood everywhere on the ground and the whole scene was painted red with blood. It was a gruesome scene.The ferocious beast Qi which was surrounding his body vanished and Lin Feng started walking slowly and carefully towards the scene.As if it was aware that something was approaching him, the Abominable Rhinoceros turned around. Its bloodthirsty eyes were staring at Lin Feng. It looked brutal, ferocious and bloodthirsty. Its pupils were huge and dark as its gaze pierced through Lin Feng.There was surprisingly someone in the world who was foolish and dared to step within its territory.The Abominable Rhinoceros was naturally strong, cruel and bloodthirsty. Once it had reached adulthood, it was a first class Ling Level ferocious beast. It could reach a length of two meters and a height of one meter. It was a giant but sturdy ferocious beast.That Abominable Rhinoceros looked like it had just reached adulthood. It was thus a first rank Ling level ferocious beast.\u201cThe Abominable Rhinoceros is quick\u2026 its horn is extremely sharp\u2026 but its strength lies in its natural defense abilities. An ordinary cultivator who is at the first Ling Qi layer could never defeat it.\u201dLin Feng was trying to remember all the characteristics of an Abominable Rhinoceros. It was impossible to easily break through its defense. Only with enough speed and a precise strike could a cultivator hope to defeat this ferocious beast, otherwise fighting it would lead to their death.At that moment, the Abominable Rhinoceros was stamping its foot on the ground. A hole appeared under its feet. It was getting ready to charge forward at any moment.Lin Feng was still incredibly relaxed as he watched the situation. A strong sword Qi was released from his body and had begun to fill the atmosphere. Before the ferocious beast could even start it\u2019s charge, Lin Feng had already thrown himself towards it.Following each of Lin Feng\u2019s step, the sword Qi which he was releasing increased and became stronger. A few steps later, the air was filled with a whistling sound.The hair which was covering the body of the Abominable Rhinoceros stood completely on end and suddenly it roared loudly and retreated.Ling level ferocious wild beasts were very intelligent and had advanced instincts. It sensed the incredibly powerful sword force which was hidden and knew that the human infront of him would be extremely dangerous to fight.\u201cMoonlight Feather Agility.\u201dLin Feng couldn\u2019t let it escape. He dashed through the air at full speed and his sword was glowing with a radiant light.\u201cOne strike, one life.\u201dThe sword force completely filled the atmosphere. A white light was being emitted from the tip of the sword.The running Abominable Rhinoceros had a cut which had appeared on its body but it continued to run forwards. Blood was rushing out of its body and left a long thick trial of blood behind it as it ran. It was badly injured and was losing large amounts of blood.Some poisonous Qi started flowing out from the body of the rhinoceros. Lin Fengs thrust his sword into the Qi and in an instant the Qi had vanished. The Abominable Rhinoceros was dead.Ferocious beasts were extremely sensitive to blood. In the Black Wind Mountain, there were too many extremely strong ferocious beasts. Therefore, Lin Feng would need to quickly kill the Abominable Rhinoceros and would then leave, otherwise the blood would attract too many ferocious beasts who would be attracted by the blood.Lin Feng was extremely satisfied with his sword skills and the power unleashed with each strike. Even though the Abominable Rhinoceros was extremely strong and its body was tough, its body had suffered lethal injuries from a single strike with Lin Feng\u2019s sword.As Lin Feng continued to move through the mountain. Lin Feng killed another Ling Level ferocious wild beast but this time it wasn\u2019t the Abominable Rhinoceros but an Earthshaking Bear. As before, Lin Feng killed it in one strike.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Two days later, on the outskirts of the Black Wind Mountain, a young man had appeared and all of his clothes were torn and dirty, he was filthy from head to toe. He was carrying a sword in his hand and in front of him, there was a gigantic snake.That snake was about twenty meters long. It\u2019s extremely thick body was slithering on the ground towards the young man. Its head was five meters up in the air. It looked hideous and ferocious. It looked like it was ready to strike at any moment.Its gigantic eyes were green and were filled with murderous light. Poison and blood was endlessly spraying from its mouth.\u201cA second level Ling ferocious wild beast is incredibly hard to deal with as expected.\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s robes had a large hole through which one could see his skin where he had been struck, he was bruised and the area had turned dark purple. Lin Feng was worn out from this fight. Lin Feng had been injured by fighting with that Python of Darkness.During these two days, Lin Feng had killed around a hundred ferocious beasts, all at the Ling Level. He had killed a few second level Ling ferocious beasts as well but it was the first time that he came across such a strong and dangerous ferocious beast.\u201cSssssss, ssssssss\u2026\u2026.\u201d Its huge tongue was flickering through the air while it continues to hiss. The snake was spitting out poison and Lin Feng would have to constantly avoid the poison from the snake.But at that moment, the huge Python of Darkness fell down and its head crashed into the ground. This was because its tail had been damaged and pinned by a tree which had fallen down onto it. The snake couldn\u2019t avoid it.Suddenly, a strong gust of wing had filled the air.If Lin Feng didn\u2019t have good agility techniques, he would have already been killed. The second level Ling Python of Darkness was incredibly strong and powerful.Suddenly, the space in front of Lin Feng filled with light and slashed down onto the python before vanishing from sight again.The snake emitted an extremely loud moan. Lin Feng had felt like he was being oppressed by the power of the snake. The Python of Darkness kept moving towards him.\u201cBOOM! BOOOM! BOOOM!\u2026\u201dThe trees were cracking as the python was crushing everything on its path. Lin Feng was like a shadow in the sun and was too fast for the snake to catch him. If there was an observer, he would think that the snake had gone mad and was chasing an illusion.Even though the Python of Darkness was only the second level of the Ling level, even an extremely strong cultivator of the third Ling Qi layer would find it difficult to escape with his life. They knew it would be extremely difficult to kill the snake and would never directly confront it. However, Lin Feng had just reached the second Ling Qi layer two days before and was not aware of how dangerous the python was.\u201cDeadly sword!\u201d shouted Lin Feng. At that moment, his extremely strong and powerful sword thrust towards the Python of Darkness which cut through its body leaving it severely bleeding.But this time it seemed like the snake hadn\u2019t felt the strike connect with its body. It wanted Lin Feng\u2019s life and had gone into a complete frenzy.\u201cI\u2019m not playing with you anymore.\u201dLin Feng had almost gotten killed by the Python of Darkness multiple times already. After two days continuously fighting within this mountain, his sword skills had already become much stronger than before. He had even more confidence in his own ability. He was convinced that he would be able to defeat almost any cultivator in the second Ling Qi layer\u2026 after all, how many cultivators of the second Ling Qi layer were stronger than the Python of Darkness?Lin Feng released the first layer of his Celestial spirit. His eyes became pitch black and he was surrounded by a world of darkness. Nothing could escape from his vision, he could see and feel everything. Even if the snake was extremely quick, its attacks seemed slow to the Lin Feng that now stood before it.The snake was about to attack from the side. Lin Feng was firmly holding his soft sword. Which emitted an ice cold light.A deadly sword Qi emanated from Lin Feng\u2019 body. It looked like it could destroy anything it touched.Lin Feng raised his head. He calmly looked at the Python of Darkness that was moving towards him. Lin Feng\u2019s eyes looked like that of a brutal demon. At that moment, he was extremely heartless and there was not an ounce of mercy left inside him.\u201cDeadly sword.\u201dLin Feng had faintly said those words. His mouth had barely moved. He wielded his long sword which was releasing a strong Qi as well as a strange grey Qi\u2026 It was a deadly Qi.\u201cTsss\u2026 tsss\u2026\u201dThe extremely powerful grey Qi moved very quickly and was accompanied by a long and painful screech. That strike had cut the snake cleanly into two halves. A cloud of dust rose into the air and the snake hit the ground.The body of the Python of Darkness was still writhing on the ground as if it did not believe it was dead. Lin Feng used his long sword to pierce through the python\u2019s skull and with that action it had completely stopped moving. The atmosphere had become calm once more.Lin Feng had managed to kill the Python of Darkness, a second level Ling ferocious beast!Deadly sword. Lin Feng\u2019s sword could truly be called deadly after being bathed in blood these two days in the Black Wind Mountain.Lin Feng stepped forward and picked up the precious items from the body of the Python of Darkness then left towards the sect.Two days and the flood of ferocious beasts had already strongly decreased to the point that it wasn\u2019t a flood anymore. It also seemed that the elite disciple exam was about to start in the upcoming days.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At the edge of the Black Wind Mountain there were only a few Qi Layer ferocious beasts and a great quantity of dead ferocious beasts.Of course, there weren\u2019t only carcasses of ferocious beasts, there were also human corpses which showed that some disciples had lost their lives while fighting against the flood of ferocious beasts. Streams of blood were flowing endlessly on the ground making a river of blood which was flowing down the mountain. It showed how terrible and fierce the flood of ferocious beasts had been to have caused such a scene.It had been mostly weaker ferocious beasts in that flood, if there had been a flood of stronger ferocious beasts, what would have happened to the sect?At the base of the mountain there was still a great deal of Yun Hai Sect disciples. The majority of these disciples were ordinary disciples who were fighting against Qi Layer ferocious beasts. They were using the battle to develop their skills while also gathering precious items.\u201cHaha, there is a ferocious beast of the Ling Level, try to prevent it from leaving and then I will kill it.\u201dAt that moment, a clear and bright voice spread throughout the atmosphere followed by an extremely loud laughter.Some people saw that there were two Yun Hai ordinary disciples were fighting together against a ferocious beast of the Ling level. Actually, they had an Abominable Rhinoceros in front of them.Between them and the Abominable Rhinoceros, there were carcasses of ferocious beasts. The two ordinary disciples seemed to be ignoring them. They were focused completely on the opponent in front of them and were filled with greed from the precious items they could receive from its body.\u201cThe Abominable Rhinoceros is extremely strong and its strongest point is its defense. Do you think you can kill it?\u201d said a thin young man. His name was Po Jun. He was staring at the Abominable Rhinoceros whose eyes looked bloodthirsty and violent.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Po Jun, don\u2019t you believe in my abilities?\u201dThe thin young man named Po Jun simply grinned at the other disciple. The other disciple seemed really confident in his abilities.\u201cThe only person I trust is myself.\u201d said Po Jun. But at the same time, he grabbed two rattans that he was carrying and threw them at the Abominable Rhinoceros to bind it in place.\u201cRrrrhmmpphh\u2026\u201d The Abominable Rhinoceros was enraged and tried to move around but it seemed to be unable to move freely, it was growing more and more furious over time. Po Jun was being whipped back and forth by the beast but he still had a calm composure. He was holding the rattans steadily trying to use them to bind the Abominable Rhinoceros. He was managing to lock the Abominable Rhinoceros in place.\u201cATTACK NOW!!\u201d yelled Po Jun. There was no need to shout this as his friend was already there attacking the Abominable Rhinoceros within the blink of an eye.The Abominable Rhinoceros was stamping on the ground heavily which made a cloud of dust rise into the air. It was going into a frenzy.Po Jun\u2019s friend carried out an extremely strong attack on the rhinoceros using both his palms. The Abominable Rhinoceros roared extremely loudly. One strike had been enough for the beast to meet a brutal and instant death.\u201cPo Jun, how was that? Was it a mistake to cooperate with me?\u201d asked the strong young man while smiling. At that moment, Po Jun had already stepped forward and started removing all of the precious items from the corpse.\u201cWhen you\u2019ve broken through to the Ling Qi layer, it\u2019s really a different level. Your spirit gives enough strength to deal with some opponents.\u201d thought Lin Feng who saw that Po Jun had used rattans. Obviously, that was his spirit. It was similar to Mo Xie\u2019s spirit. Of course, Mo Xie\u2019s strength and Po Jun\u2019s strength were not on the same level though.\u201cI would have never thought that this guy\u2019s strength had improved so much.\u201dLin Feng was smiling. He then moved forwards to the two young people who were picking up their precious items.\u201cWho?\u201dAt that moment, Po Jun quickly turned around. An extremely strong Qi quickly burst out of his body and his two rattans started moving towards Lin Feng.\u201cHuh?\u201dLin Feng was surprised, he hadn\u2019t thought that Po Jun\u2019s defense perimeter was so wide and that he\u2019d attack so quickly upon sensing someone moving closer to them.Lin Feng stepped aside really quickly and a strong sword Qi emerged from his body, directly crashing down onto Po Jun making him almost suffocate from the intense pressure.\u201cPo Jun, stop it, he\u2019s my friend.\u201dThe strong young disciple said quickly as he had turned around and saw the scene infront of him.At that moment, Po Jun recalled the rattans back and the Qi which was suffocating him had vanished as well. He remained vigilant and kept watching Lin Feng very closely.\u201cThat guy, he is incredibly strong!\u201d\u201cHaha, Lin Feng, you\u2019re finally showing yourself. I came to look for you more than a dozen times and I couldn\u2019t find you anywhere. I thought you had left the Yun Hai Sect forever\u2026\u201dIt turned out that that strong young disciple was Lin Feng\u2019s friend: Han Man.\u201cI just came back a little while ago.\u201d Said Lin Feng while smiling before adding: \u201cHan Man, you\u2019re now able to kill a ferocious beast of the Ling Level\u2026 You have progressed so fast!\u201dWhen Lin Feng had left for Yangzhou City, at that time Han Man was only at the eighth Qi layer. In that short amount of time, Han Man had surprisingly broken through to the Ling Qi layer. Lin Feng was astonished. He was, of course, also extremely happy for Han Man. He did not have many friends but he would definitely count Han Man as one of them.\u201cHaha, I\u2019ve broken through to the Ling Qi layer but I was just lucky this time.\u201d Han Man said while scratching his head and then continued: \u201cOh, anyway, How about you Lin Feng? You used to be much stronger than me. How strong have you become now?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just an average dsiciple.\u201d said Lin Feng with a big teasing smile on his face. Lin Feng was looking at Han Man\u2019s friend, Po Jun. That guy had an ice cold expression on his face. He looked like he was ready to strike Lin Feng if he made the wrong move. If that was the case, it could made things complicated and unpredictable for Han Man.\u201cOh by the way, I forgot to introduce the two of you. Lin Feng this is Po Jun. He\u2019s extremely strong but he\u2019s discreet and very reserved, unlike the ordinary disciples who consider themselves the best because of some ranking. He is also much stronger than them.Han Man said as he was smiling while introducing them to each other.\u201cPo Jun, this is Lin Feng. He is like a brother to me. I hope you can become good friends with him as well.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m first taking the precious items we have just obtained.\u201dSaid Po Jun while looking cold and indifferently. Then, he turned around and continued what he was doing. He took out a dagger and split the beast open to harvest the materials which could be traded into the sect.\u201cLin Feng, don\u2019t worry, Po Jun just has that kind of personality. He\u2019s a very cold person but he is a good guy.\u201dLin Feng ignored it and kept smiling. Po Jun and Lin Feng were not friends so it didn\u2019t matter if Po Jun did not interact with him. There was no need to get offended by a stranger\u2019s behavior.\u201cHan Man, everybody has started to leave, how come you are still out here fighting?\u201d\u201cMany of them have left because of the Elite Disciple Exam. As we were already here, we thought we should get some more precious items to trade with the sect. We are the only two remaining Ling Qi Layer in the surrounding area so there should not be a problem. All that remains are Qi layer disciples.\u201cAre you not getting ready for the Elite Disciple Exam?Lin Feng was stupefied and couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll join. I\u2019m not late yet. I still have some time to collect more riches. Hehe.\u201d Han Man was the same guy as before, always smiling and positive. Lin Feng sometimes had the impression he was talking to a simple minded person\u2026 but at least these kinds of people were honest and true to themselves. They were not the kind of people to have evil intentions in their hearts and they are easy to get along with.\u201cPo Jun, it\u2019s alright, there is nothing of value in the area and I doubt we have missed something.\u201dHan Man said while looking at Po Jun.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s leave.\u201dPo Jun said while nodding. He picked up the bag full of precious items and stood up.\u201cLin Feng, you should leave too. Let\u2019s go back together.\u201d said Han Man to Lin Feng and then asked: \u201cLin Feng, come on, tell me, how strong are you now?\u201dLin Feng thought for a while and then shook his head. He was actually unable to clearly identify his own strength. Maybe he had to fight against someone of the third Ling Qi layer to correctly judge his current level of strength.\u2026\u2026\u201cYou really enjoy being mysterious\u2026 and keep so many things secret from me. Can you cope with an Abominable Rhinoceros or not?\u201d asked Han Man whose curiosity had become unbearable. He needed to know.\u201cCope with an Abominable Rhinoceros alone?\u201d thought Po Jun when he heard Han Man ask that question. Lin Feng\u2019s strength was certainly of the Ling Qi layer. A moment ago, the Qi from Lin Feng\u2019s sword had almost made him suffocate and created immense pressure on his body. Po Jun would have probably been defeated by Lin Feng in an instant if they had fought and Po Jun was sure that he would not even be using his full strength. Po Jun could not measure how strong this young man was.Even though the Abominable Rhinoceros had extremely high defense abilities, Lin Feng had had no problem killing one using his sword.\u201cI should be able to handle it.\u201d said Lin Feng while touching his nose. Dealing with an Abominable Rhinoceros? He had required only one hit to deal a lethal blow on one previously, but even then it did not require him to use his full strength.\u201cHehe, you obviously have broken through to the Ling Qi layer. This time, we three will probably pass the Elite Disciple Exam and all become Elite Disciples. After that, we will be able to work hard and become pillars of the Yun Hai Sect.\u201d said Han Man joyfully with a big smile on his face. Three Disciples of the Ling Qi layer, they would probably be able to accomplish great things if they worked together.\u201cWork hard for the sect? Whose decision is that?\u201d asked Po Jun tactlessly. He thought that Han Man was really naive.\u201cWe should let Lin Feng decide. He\u2019s a real genius and he has a much greater potential than me. Even though he may be weaker than me now, he will probably surpass my power later. He\u2019s always been there to protect the weak\u2026 He saved my life. Whatever he says, I will always listen to him.\u201d said Han Man sounding extremely simple minded.\u201cWhat about me?\u201d asked Po Jun.\u201cYou and I are very strong but since I listen to Lin Feng, you should obviously listen to Lin Feng as well.\u201d said Han Man which sounded extremely simple and completely illogical. Lin Feng was speechless and was looking at him while stupefied. That guy was so naive and his thoughts were so simple. Po Jun would never be convinced by such naive statements. Who would?\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66 - Asking for TroublePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the Stormy Gorge, a huge crowd had gathered which almost seemed endless, the crowd had gathered in front of the Life and Death Arena. They were all young disciples of the Yun Hai Sect who were excitedly talking amongst themselves. There was such a larger number of disciples that they were all standing shoulder to shoulder. Looking down from above it looked like thousands upon thousands of ants.On the top of the cliffs surrounding the gorge there was also a large crowd of people looking down at the gorge. They were all staring at the people in the arena, these people all had sharp expressions on their faces. There was a powerful Qi which was filling the atmosphere around the arena.There were some people within the gorge who were extremely strong compared to the average disciple of the sect. They were the high level disciples of the sect. Nan Gong Ling, many years ago was one of those disciples. Nan Gong Ling sat in the middle of the high level Yun Hai Sect disciples and elders.Those participating in the Elite Disciple Exam were some of the most important disciples of the Yun Hai Sect. It was the first time in many years that there were so many ordinary disciples who would attend Elite Disciple Exam. Some of them were going to become Elite Disciples within the sect and some of the strongest participants could even become Core Disciples.Of course, some of them were going to be eliminated from the exam altogether.That was the rule: fight and win or be eliminated.Ordinary disciples who sat the exam might have to fight with the current elite disciples. The battles were randomly arranged. If the ordinary disciple won, he would probably be chosen to become an elite disciple. If an elite disciple lost, he lost face and reputation.On the same basis, if an elite disciple wanted to become a core disciple, he would then need to fight a core disciple and win. If an elite disciple could defeat a core disciple then he could become one of the core disciples and would definitely gain a lot of prestige and recognition from the high ranking members of the Yun Hai Sect.The rules were very simple. You would have to fight repeatedly, fighting an elite disciple would enable an ordinary disciple a chance at promotion. There were people at the Elite Disciple Exam who had big arrogant smiles on their face from winning and there were others who looked depressed as they were eliminated.It was the first time in the year that all of the ordinary disciples, elite disciples and the core disciples were present in one place.It was the second time this year that the ordinary, elite and core disciples were going to be ranked.No matter if it was an ordinary, an elite or a core disciple whose ranking was in the Top Ten, he would gain an infinite amount of prestige within the Sect.Furthermore, the disciples who showed the most potential and placed at the top would receive great rewards such as precious stones, weapons, profound pills or maybe even extremely powerful skill books.Obviously, the elite disciples and core disciples who would get eliminated or not obtain a good ranking would be humiliated. If the disciple had bad luck then the opponent could be very strong and humiliation would be inevitable. This is why all disciples would fight with their utmost power if they wanted to achieve the best results. Losing because of underestimating an opponent would bring shame and humiliation.Lin Feng and his group had arrived at the Life and Death Arena. When they arrived, the Elite Disciple Exam had already started. Coincidentally, ordinary disciples were challenging elite disciples.At that moment, two people were fighting on the rocky stage of the Life or Death Arena. The fight was very intense and the crowd continued to discuss the battle as they watched it very closely.\u201cIt\u2019s Liu Fei, she said earlier that she had broken through to the Ling Qi layer\u2026 obviously it\u2019s true. She\u2019s very pretty and on top of that she\u2019s incredibly strong and powerful. I wish she could become my wife in the future\u2026\u201dSaid Han Man who was looking at the battle of Liu Fei while laughing. Liu Fei was a dream for many of the young disciples. They all wanted her to become their lover. Liu Fei was famous for being extremely beautiful in the Yun Hai Sect. Many of the young disciples would spend their entire lives within the sect and would even take a wife from the sect. This is why many men were courting her, including some geniuses and even core disciples\u2026The rumors said that Liu Fei was pretty and that she was a real genius\u2026 in other words, she was amazing.\u201cHaha, go ahead and ask her to become your wife!\u201d Lin Feng said while laughing at Han Man. That simpleton had even dared to imagine such a thing. Liu Fei was too much of a tomboy for him. She was violent and stubborn, he would not last a second.\u201cHehe, I think that I\u2019m pretty strong but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d manage to court her.\u201d said Han Man while laughing and scratching his head. He then continued, while looking at Lin Feng and said: \u201cBy the way Lin Feng, I heard that you got along quite well with Liu Fei. She\u2019s very beautiful and you\u2019re very handsome, you are both geniuses, you would definitely be a perfect couple.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d asked Lin Feng with a shiver running down his spine. He shrugged his shoulders and shook away the feeling from that shiver. He was so scared that it may become reality that he would have trouble sleeping later that night.Lin Feng raised his head and looked at the people around. His attention focused on a particular person.\u201cMo Xie, during this elite disciple exam, I will take care of you.\u201d thought Lin Feng while smiling coldly. He had precisely rushed to the Exam because of Mo Xie.It looked like Mo Xie could feel a dark premonition and felt like darkness itself was staring at him. He stopped looking at the arena and observed the crowd, he was glancing at everyone trying to find the source of his premonition.At that moment, Liu Fei released her spirit and effortlessly won the battle. Her bow and arrows were radiating a brilliant light as she stepped out of the arena. Lin Feng was looking at her with news eyes.For Liu Fei, joining the elite disciples wouldn\u2019t be something which would make her extremely proud. She looked around her and heaved a sigh. She had broken through to the Ling Qi layer and her spirit had awakened, she had the same spirit as her father in the past\u2026 but she still couldn\u2019t beat the person on her mind\u2026Unfortunately, Lin Feng had gone to gather some precious items and had been killed because of Mo Xie.\u201cIf he was still here, I could learn so much from him and I would certainly be able to greatly improve my strength.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know why but Liu Fei, suddenly missed Lin Feng: that unconventional and unrestrained genius\u2026 but he did have some detestable aspects.If she had the choice, Liu Fei would prefer to be fighting against Lin Feng and winning against him to that of participating in the Elite Disciple exam and becoming an elite disciple.At the same time, back at the pavilion was Protector Bei who was staring blankly at the horizon while watching Liu Fei who had just won her battle.\u201cNot bad, Liu Fei\u2026 a real genius, but you still have a lot to do before reaching your father\u2019s level. It will be hard to achieve his power while not growing in the Imperial City.\u201dProtector Bei\u2019s thoughts were flowing at full speed. Imperial City\u2026 these two words made him shiver but they were very clear to him. It was a very crowded place. There were lots of political strategies which were involved in the day to day life of the city. This was a gathering place for many strong cultivators. Cang Lan was still there to protect her but if he wasn\u2019t, maybe Liu Fei would get into trouble.\u201cI wanted to let Lin Feng go to the Imperial City. Not only would he have become more important by moving up in the hierarchy but it would have also enabled him to fight against stronger cultivators. At the same time, he could have helped Cang Lan\u2026 and maybe, he would have met his destiny there\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhile Protector Bei was thinking these things, he started to grow furious and wanted to kill Mo Xie yet again. Because of Mo Xie who had killed Lin Feng, Protector Bei\u2019s slowly realized that his dream was impossible\u2026 and these painful thoughts flowed like a stream of blood as his face turned red with anger.Lin Feng didn\u2019t know that there were so many people that missed him. At that moment, he noticed someone else.\u201cLin Feng, you\u2019re here as well! What a coincidence.\u201d Jing Yun was walking towards Lin Feng. Her expression looked fresh and pure like spring.\u201cWhat a great coincidence.\u201d said Lin Feng while looking at Jing Yun and smiling. Han Man, Jing Yun and Lin Feng were finally together again after what seemed like an extremely long time.\u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence, it\u2019s called fate.\u201d said Han Man smiling. \u201cJing Yun, I am the biggest person in the group, how come you only saw Lin Feng and not me?\u201d\u201cEhhhh\u2026\u201d Lin Feng was glaring at Han Man. That couldn\u2019t be true.\u201cWho would know someone like you?\u201d asked Jing Yun while pouting.\u201cAlright, if you don\u2019t know me then I should just go. I am starting to remember that there was a young girl who was waiting for Lin Feng every day, wondering when she would see him again.\u201d said Han Man with a fake smile on his face. Lin Feng was speechless. Since when was there a girl like that?\u201cHow would I know something like that?\u201d replied Jing Yun while blushing. She looked so delicate and charming that it was touching. Han Man couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter.Po Jun who was standing next to them looked at Lin Feng with a wry smile on his face. He was truly heartless to join in and laugh at Lin Feng.\u201cYou guys, can you shut your filthy mouths?\u201dAt that moment, a cold voice had shouted at them which had destroyed their good mood.They all looked at the person who had spoken. It was an elite disciple carrying a sword on his back and he was looking at them with a look of disdain.\u201cDoes it look like we were talking to you?\u201d Han Man said furiously. That guy was incredibly impolite so Han Man could not hold his temper.\u201cYou are courting death.\u201d said the disciple carrying a sword on his back. A strong Qi suddenly emerged from his body.\u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d said Lin Feng. It was really a huge coincidence. Lin Feng recognized that disciple. It was the elite disciple who had helped Liu Fei during their fight in the stormy gorge. It was Yu Hao, the one who said he would kill Lin Feng if Liu Fei asked it of him. He had actually almost killed him twice with that sword on his back. He was extremely strong.Yu Hao was stupefied when he heard Lin Feng. He attentively looked at Lin Feng and then remembered him. He then smiled and said: \u201cLast time, you were lucky that I didn\u2019t kill you. Are you that impatient that you want to die now?\u201d\u201cImpatient?\u201d said Lin Feng while smiling coldly. He just regretted that he hadn\u2019t broken through to the Ling Qi layer on their last meeting otherwise he would have unsheathed his sword and beheaded Yu Hao.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 - Attracting AttentionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cI am very impatient when it comes to living my life, I have such a long life to live after all.\u201d said Lin Feng smiling coldly with a strangely evil look on his face.\u201cHehe, Have met many pieces of trash in the past but I\u2019ve never met a piece of trash who was so impatient to die.\u201d said Yu Hao with extreme arrogance. He then added: \u201cSince you really want to die, I will help you achieve your goal. Wait until the end of the Elite Disciple Exam and then I will deal with you.\u201dAn ordinary disciple was worth nothing to most people within the sect. They could be killed at a whim and nobody would care, especially when in the Life and Death Arena of the Stormy Gorge.\u201cI will give you an opportunity to kill me before the end of the Elite Disciple Exam.\u201dLin Feng said while nodding his head as if he had come to a decision. Yu Hao was lost and didn\u2019t know what Lin Feng meant. Immediately after, Lin Feng started walking towards the Life and Death Arena.\u201cLin Feng, what are you doing?\u201d Jing Yun shouted as she could feel the fear gripping her heart.\u201cJing Yun, you have to trust Lin Feng. That guy is always full of surprises.\u201d said Han Man to Jing Yun trying to reassure her. Even though they hadn\u2019t been friends for a very long time, Han Man really admired Lin Feng. He was beyond insane, but he was truly a genius. He would fight anyone at the drop of a hat when it came to his friends. Each time they met, Lin Feng did something unpredictable.Jing Yun tried not to worry but she could only make her heart grow slightly calmer. She looked at Han Man and nodded. That\u2019s right, it looked like Lin Feng was going to do something dangerous and unpredictable again.Jing Yun couldn\u2019t help but be worried about Lin Feng. Going into the Life and Death Arena and challenging an elite disciple wasn\u2019t something one could do easily. If you wanted to become an elite disciple within the sect then you first had to have an incredible strength, luck was of no use. To become an elite disciple, the only way was to be stronger than a former elite disciple.\u201cHuh?\u201d Yu Hao frowned. He hadn\u2019t replied yet. Han Man and Jing Yun understood what Lin Feng wanted to do because they were friends with him and could understand him\u2026 Besides, Yu Hao was extremely arrogant, how could he imagine what Lin Feng wanted to do?Yu Hao smiled at Liu Fei who had already made her way out of the arena. He moved towards Liu Fei. Such a beautiful girl needed attention and who better than him to give it to her.The Life and Death Arena was huge. Disciples could fight against other disciples on different rocky fighting stages. While the battles were randomly picked, they could also fight each other as they wished.However, it seemed like there was an unwritten agreement between everybody to not step onto a fighting stage if there were already too many people fighting. This was also beneficial for the observers as they could only focus on a certain amount of action at once. If everyone started to fight then it would quickly become chaos.Of course, no one had any plans to step onto the highest stage. Ordinary disciples didn\u2019t want to seem too self confident in their abilities. Overestimating their own powers would give the seniors of the Sect a bad impression. Only real geniuses, the most talented Disciples, would dare climb onto the highest stage and amaze the entire crowd.At that moment, Wang Mang stepped onto a stage within the Life And Death Arena.But at that moment, he saw that someone else wanted to get onto it as well.\u201cHey, friend.\u201d shouted Wang Mang while smiling at Lin Feng to get his attention. He was the third ranked ordinary disciple. He was extremely strong and had the arrogance of a ranked disciple who had not seen the world. He assumed that Lin Feng would notice he wanted to get on the stage and would let him go first.But what Wang Mang hadn\u2019t planned is that Lin Feng stared at him and nodded to return the greeting while looking indifferent, he then continued walking towards the fighting stage. It really did look like Lin Feng wasn\u2019t going to let him go first.Wang Mang frowned. He was extremely famous amongst all the ordinary disciples. He wouldn\u2019t have thought that Lin Feng wouldn\u2019t give him face and let him go first. He wanted to open his mouth but he was speechless. He was too stupefied at what had happened. He opened his mouth to speak but no words could come out.\u201cCrazy moron.\u201d said Wang Mang in a low voice filled with anger. He immediately went back to where he was standing before. That other disciple was heading towards the central fighting stage. How insolent! This was the first time that someone dared to go onto it.Wang Mang wasn\u2019t the only one who was surprised but the entire crowd was stupefied to see someone go on that particular fighting stage. Their eyes were wide open. The crowd burst into an uproar and was wondering who that guy was.\u201cIt\u2019s him. So he wasn\u2019t devoured by the Imaginary Demon\u2026? He\u2019s surprisingly still living!\u201d said someone who had seen Lin Feng at the moment when he had been consumed by the black fog of the Imaginary Demon. The person was stupefied to see Lin Feng living and breathing before him.\u201cOh my\u2026.. He is insane\u2026..\u201d Han Man, Jing Yun as well as Po Jun were all astounded. Lin Feng did not fail to surprise them.However, Han Man had a big smile on his face. He had the feeling that Lin Feng was stronger than him, much stronger than him. He even had that feeling when he hadn\u2019t seen Lin Feng. He really admired Lin Feng and believed that he held an incredible strength.In the Stormy Gorge, Mo Xie was stupefied. How was this possible? How could Lin Feng still be alive?He was just an ordinary disciple and he had been eaten by an Imaginary Demon\u2026 how could he come back alive?\u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201d Like everybody else, Nan Gong Ling was also astonished. His face showed how relieved he was. Now he would be able to tell Protector Bei and Protector Kong that Lin Feng was alright and the punishment of Mo Xie would not be so harsh.\u201cHaha, that young man never dies!\u201d said a voice coming from the pavilion where an old man was sitting. It almost sounded like he was cursing but he was actually very cheerful.\u201cYou continue to surprise me, young man.\u201d thought Protector Bei smiling. The first time that he had met Lin Feng, he had already had a good impression. The second time, Lin Feng had made the drums of the Precipice of Zhangu beat which had stupefied Protector Kong and Protector Bei\u2026 and this time, he had been eaten by an Imaginary Demon and then returned without a single injury on his body. He really was the king of miracles.At that moment, Yu Hao arrived next to Liu Fei. He looked at Lin Feng who had stepped on the fighting stage and said while laughing: \u201cFei Fei, that piece of trash surprisingly dares go onto the fighting stage. He really wants to die.\u201dLiu Fei frowned. She didn\u2019t like Yu Hao calling her by a nickname. She was in a bad mood because of this. Then, she looked at the fighting stage and her expression immediately changed, her beautiful eyes were filled with delight.\u201cHe is not dead!!!\u201dLiu Fei was astonished and then a beautiful and resplendent smile appeared on her face.\u201cYou\u2019re not dead\u2026 that\u2019s a good thing, I will beat you myself. I will humiliate you.\u201dYu Hao saw that Liu Fei was smiling and looked enchanted but he didn\u2019t seem to understand. Then thinking that he could be her hero, he said: \u201cFei Fei, just like last time, you just need to open your mouth and I\u2019ll go kill than piece of trash when he\u2019s done with his challenge. \u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll kill him?\u201d Liu Fei asked while looking at Yu Hao. Even though Yu Hao had a Sword Spirit and was quite strong, he hadn\u2019t progressed for a year because he hadn\u2019t been practicing. He was still at the first Ling Qi layer. If he fought against Lin Feng, did he even stand a chance?Besides, what Liu Fei wanted the most was to defeat Lin Feng herself.\u201cYes, you only have to nod your head and I\u2019ll put an end to his life.\u201d said Yu Hao while smiling.\u201cYu Hao\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dYu Hao was still smiling when the sound of an annoyed voice went straight into his ears.\u201cYu Hao, Where have you run away? Come and fight me, damn you!\u201dLin Feng was standing on the highest fighting stage. He raised his head and looked at everyone who was observing from above on the cliffs of the Stormy Gorge. He wanted to go to the highest place, the most craziest of places and look down on the world.Yu Hao was still smiling. He hadn\u2019t gone to the fighting stage. He hadn\u2019t understood what Lin Feng had meant a moment ago. He did not understand that Lin Feng was actually challenging him to a fight. However he really wanted to fight with Lin Feng.During the Elite Disciple Exam, being challenged was a humiliation because it meant you were weak. If you were weak, people wanted to fight against you.But at that moment, Yu Hao was being challenged. On top of that, he was being challenged by the one he wanted to kill to win the affection of Liu Fei.However, he hadn\u2019t thought that Lin Feng would challenge him right after he finished talking. Obviously, he had just been humiliated in front of a countless number of people. He had the feeling he had just been slapped in the face.Yu Hao\u2019s expression looked like that of a demon. He was staring at Lin Feng with a cruel expression.\u201cFei Fei, that guy wants to challenge me, that\u2019s great. I\u2019m going to kill that shitty piece of trash.\u201dAs before, Yu Hao had no doubts about his own strength. He started walking towards the stage while still looking evil.The entire crowd was amazed. Lin Feng was truly insane.Not only had Lin Feng immediately stepped on the highest fighting stage but he was also challenging Yu Hao.Yu Hao was far from being one of the weakest Elite Disciples. Before the Elite Disciple Exam, ordinary disciples had already checked the profiles of the different elite disciples. They had access to a list which contained detailed information on their strength levels. Yu Hao was far above the weak elite disciples. He had a Sword Spirit and he was very talented and strong. He was much stronger than most of the average elite disciples. Nobody would have thought of challenging him.Yu Hao hadn\u2019t expected someone to challenge him either.As he moved onto the fighting stage, Yu Hao while still looking like a demon, said: \u201cI wanted to let you live a bit longer but you already want to die\u2026So impatient\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in no hurry to deal with you, wait until I am done.\u201d said Lin Feng while smiling. He stopped looking at Yu Hao and turned to the crowd.\u201cLi Lin, get your ass onto the damn fighting stage as well.\u201dLin Feng continued to spit insults in the faces of elite disciples. Li Lin while in the Xing Chen Pavilion hadn\u2019t dared to confront Chen Chen, so he had decided to take it out on Lin Feng. Lin Feng still remembered and planned to settle his grudge.Everybody in the crowd was astonished at his actions. Li Lin\u2026 That was the name of another elite disciple, what did he intend to do by challenging two elite disciples at the same time?\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 - The Sword MasterPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDuring the first round of the Elite Disciple Exam everyone had to be in attendance, elite disciples as well as core disciples, because they could be challenged at anytime by another disciple within the sect.Li Lin was no exception to this rule.When Li Lin heard that he was being challenged by Lin Feng, his heart was pounding. That guy had probably broken through to the Ling Qi layer and wanted his revenge.But then Li Lin tried to relax because Lin Feng hadn\u2019t only called his name instead he had called two: his name and Yu Hao\u2019s.Yu Hao was infinitely stronger than Li Lin. He had a overpowering Sword Spirit and he was known as a genius. Lin Feng had even dared to challenge him but he was probably going to die because he could not fight against Yu Hao.When entering the Life and Death Arena, Li Lin started to get nervous. When he saw that everybody was looking at him, he could feel his heart pounding in his chest.\u201cWhat are you doing? Why are you making him come onto the fighting stage as well?\u201d asked Yu Hao glancing at Li Lin. He was puzzled. Besides, he despised being associated with a weakling like Li Lin.\u201cI will fight both of you at the same time.\u201dLin Feng didn\u2019t reply to Yu Hao and just said these words in a cold tone which made Yu Hao frown in anger.Insanity\u2026Madness\u2026In the entire history of the Yun Hai Sect which dated back a thousand years, nobody had ever dared challenge two higher ranked disciples at the same time during the Elite Disciple Exam.Lin Feng, a simple ordinary disciple had challenged two elite disciples to fight against him. To make things even more shocking, one of them was an extremely strong cultivator who had a Sword Spirit. Lin Feng had broken a new record of insane behavior.\u201cThat ordinary disciple is so arrogant and clearly overestimates his own power, even if he is incredibly strong, is it right to act in such a way?\u201dMo Xie had said that in a cold and belittling tone. Not only was Mo Xie very strong but he also had a high status within the sect. Besides, his father Mo Cang Lan was standing behind him. Therefore, he was trying to regain some of the face he had already lost.Nan Gong Ling was coldly looking at Mo Xie but remained expressionless. It was impossible to tell what he was thinking.Regarding Protector Bei, he was just laughing and shaking his head: \u201cThis young man really has no limits!\u201d\u201cTogether? Who do you think you are, you piece of trash?\u201dYu Hao\u2019s face twisted in anger and revealed a hideous expression. What kind of person was he after all? A sword master with a strong Sword Spirit and he was an elite disciple?Yu Hao despised Lin Feng. He thought that Lin Feng was an insolent piece of trash, he thought that comparing the two was the difference between earth and heaven. Yu Hao thought that it was an honor for Lin Feng to call a noble person such as himself onto the stage.But Lin Feng had not only called him onto the stage. He had also called someone else. Surprisingly, he wanted to fight against two people at the same time. Wasn\u2019t Yu Hao being humiliated from his actions?\u201cExactly! What are you thinking? Suddenly challenging both of us at the same time. Yu Hao has an extremely strong Sword Spirit, he\u2019s very powerful and can kill you with a single strike. How can you be so arrogant?!\u201dLi Lin was licking Yu Hao\u2019s boots and trying to gain favor from Yu Hao. Then, Yu Hao would do all the work alone and defeat Lin Feng while he could just stand and watch. Then he would not have to fight at all, this was obviously the best choice for someone like him who was incredibly weak for an elite disciple.Yu Hao seemed to enjoy being complimented by others. A big smile had appeared on his face and he then said: \u201cHaha, Li Lin, you\u2019re entirely right. It\u2019s not worth unsheathing my sword for such a worthless ordinary disciple\u2026 you help me take care of him.\u201d\u201cOf course. But for such a worthless ordinary disciple to dare to challenge Yu Hao, he should be humiliated. Fellow disciple Yu Hao should show him how big the difference is between you and him.\u201dWhen Li Lin heard Yu Hao\u2019s words, he got frightened that he would have to fight. He didn\u2019t know if Yu Hao wanted him to fight so he did his best to lure Yu Hao into fighting alone. He really did not want to engage in a battle with Lin Feng.\u201cThat guy is such a disgrace for our mighty Sect. He\u2019s making all of the members of the Yun Hai Sect, lose face.\u201d said members of the crowd while looking at Li Lin. He was so shameless. But that guy actually had to defend his point of view.\u201cYou are so pathetic.\u201d Lin Feng was sneering at Li Lin. \u201cLi Lin, when I was looking for skills in the Xing Chen Pavilion, you attacked Chen Chen and then you ended up being scared to death by him causing everybody to laugh at you. Coincidentally, there was another ordinary disciple there so you decided to pick a fight with me. You also threatened me that you would kill me. You insulted me several times and called me a piece of trash. Now, I challenge you and you seem to be terrified, how come?\u201d\u201cYu Hao, you who have a mighty Sword Spirit, what a genius! You attacked me without any reason on that day. You said that you could kill me anytime but it seems like you were just bullying me and trying to humiliate those weaker than yourself. Now, I am standing in front of you willing to fight but where is your sword?\u201dLin Feng said in a very cold tone. Everybody in the crowd understood what had happened. These two elite disciples were very pretentious. They had both provoked and bullied that ordinary disciple but now that he had become stronger, he wanted to get his revenge.Yu Hao\u2019s face grew vicious and he said to Li Lin: \u201cI will give you three seconds, if you don\u2019t attack him within that time, I will cripple your Cultivation.\u201dLi Lin was furious. He was gnashing his teeth in hatred for Yu Hao.On that day, Yu Hao had bullied Lin Feng and treated him as if he was an insignificant existence. At that moment, Lin Feng\u2019s behavior towards him was strangely similar.\u201cAlright, I will start and then you finish him.\u201dLi Lin said against his will\u2026 He was really forcing himself to fight. He then started moving towards Lin Feng.Lin Feng shook his head. His style looked incredibly laughable. Lin Feng really wondered how that guy had managed to become an elite disciple.\u201cGet lost\u2026\u201dLin Feng then thrust his palm into the air and used his Eight Strikes of Desolation. Four strikes immediately broke through the air and crashed onto Li Lin\u2019s body.\u201cBOOM!\u201d\u201cBOOM!\u201d\u201cBOOM!\u201d\u201cBOOM!\u201dLi Lin was one of the weakest elite disciples. His strength was so low that he could not match some ordinary disciples. Lin Feng had hit him with a single skill while not even using his full strength and that had made him fly through the air and heavily crash outside the Life and Death Arena main stage.Lin Feng ignored Li Lin after that and said to Yu Hao: \u201cSo what are you waiting for? I thought you were going to kill me.\u201d\u201cFour strikes\u2026.That\u2019s all? That\u2019s only half of eight strikes, how laughable.\u201dYu Hao knew what attack Lin Feng had used. In the Yun Hai Sect many people had learnt and practiced it to a similar level. Most elite disciples who had practiced it had managed to do four strikes and some talented individual had done five. But there were very few people who managed to do more than four strikes within the elite disciple. It was extremely rare to see someone talented enough to break through four strikes.Lin Feng had only used four of the eight possible strikes but he could freely control how many strikes he used. He did not want to use his full strength when dealing with Li Lin.\u201cEven though I said I would kill you, today is the Elite Disciple Exam\u2026 even though we are in the Life and Death Arena, we are not allowed to directly kill. So today I will just cripple your Cultivation and break both of your arms. You will be half dead when we finish this battle.\u201dYu Hao was already very cruel to begin with and now he had hatred towards Lin Feng.While talking, Yu Hao was unsheathed the sword that he was carrying on his back. His sword was already glowing and its light was radiant. The glowing light looked like the water of a river as sunlight shone down upon it. It was a truly dazzling light. An intangible Qi started spreading through the air.That wouldn\u2019t be enough though. Yu Hao released his sword spirit. It was an extremely sharp sword shadow which appeared behind him. It was pointing towards the Heavens as if it was about to cut down the heavens themselves.\u201cEven though those who possess a sword spirit are not weak, Lin Feng is also dangerous.\u201dThe disciples in the crowd who were close to the arena could sense the strength and power contained within the sword Qi. They had the sensation that they were being pressured by the power of Yu Hao which made them feel dizzy and uncomfortable. However Lin Feng who was standing much closer had no reaction.\u201cI know that you like to rely on your sword spirit so I will show you what it really means to be a sword master.\u201dLin Feng said with a voice filled with killing intent. He then unsheathed the sword he was carrying on his back and a powerful Qi spread through the atmosphere moving towards Yu Hao\u2019s sword. The pressure within the atmosphere suddenly increased greatly.\u201cWhat, he\u2019s also a sword user. Does he have a Sword Spirit?\u201dEverybody was shaking when they sensed the Qi contained within Lin Feng\u2019s sword. Yu Hao was also stupefied. Everyone was shocked because Lin Feng had unleashed this pressure without releasing a sword spirit. Lin Feng had a faintly discernible smile on the corner of his mouth.\u201cWhy would he use sword skills if he doesn\u2019t have a sword spirit?\u201dYu Hao made a step forwards. Suddenly, a whistling noise spread throughout the atmosphere. The devastating sword Qi was growing more and more powerful. The Sword Spirit behind his back was also glowing brighter and brighter.Yu Hao\u2019s sword Qi was getting stronger and cutting through the atmosphere moving straight towards Lin Feng.\u201cDo you necessarily need to have a sword spirit to use sword skills? Can the cultivators who possess a Sword Spirit only use sword skills?\u201d asked Lin Feng looking extremely calm. He stepped forward and said: \u201cEven with your sword spirit you don\u2019t understand the basic principles of wielding a sword.\u201d\u201cBOOM!\u201dSuddenly, an extremely strong Qi shot towards Yu Hao. Even his own Qi was retreating from the Qi which had been unleashed.Lin Feng had started to gather sword force into the tip of his sword. The power which was released was incredible.\u201cForce, he is using sword force.\u201dPeople in the crowd seldom saw cultivators who had knowledge of forces and when they saw some, they were usually battles between elite disciples and core disciples. Everyone had started to sense the immense power that was contained within his sword, the crowd was growing more shocked.\u201cSo that\u2019s sword force.\u201d\u201cHow powerful!\u201dThere was an infinite amount of Qi which was also released from the sword. This had allowed Lin Feng to utterly suppress Yu Hao.\u201cOh my\u2026 He\u2019s only an ordinary disciple who just broke through to the Ling Qi layer and he already controls his sword force to perfection. What a genius!\u201dSome people knew that forces were extremely hard to understand and control, especially at Lin Feng\u2019s level. Even some cultivators who had reached the peak of the Ling Qi layer were not necessarily able to control forces to the extent of Lin Feng, but Lin Feng seemed to master the forces to perfection.Of course, some of the ordinary disciples didn\u2019t even know what a force was and were asking other disciples how Lin Feng had such a powerful and oppressive sword.\u201cHe\u2019s the one who beat the drums at the Precipice of Zhangu. He\u2019s so young and already extremely powerful. I could only dream to be that strong at his age. He definitely deserves a high status within the sect. He truly deserved the title of a true genius. We should take good care of him and honor him. He will become the future of the sect.\u201dNan Gong Ling understood what Protector Bei had been talking about previously and now understood why Lin Feng was so important. He was a pillar of the Sect. A solution had to be found so that Mo Xie wouldn\u2019t attempt to kill him again. That young man was a genius.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 - FuryPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNan Gong Ling felt happy but Mo Xie was not happy in the slightest. He had an evil look covering his face.\u201cThat young man is too outstanding\u2026 He should have been killed at birth.\u201d Mo Xie thought evilly. Lin Feng had humiliated him so even if he was a genius, he had to be killed and Mo Xie couldn\u2019t afford to wait until Lin Feng grew up as he would become too strong.In the middle of the crowd, Han Man felt at ease. He had a smile on the corner of his lips: \u201cHe really has become so strong already. He even managed to convince me that I might be stronger.\u201dWhen he saw that Lin Feng was stronger than him, he was really happy for his sworn brother.Jing Yun, who was standing next to him, also had a brilliant smile on her face. She looked like a lotus flower in blossom. Her smile looked so pure and innocent, it could charm any man who saw.Po Jun, who was standing next to them, had a sparkle in his eyes while looking at Lin Feng on the fighting stage. He thought: \u201cNo wonder he was able to react so quickly against me and with such a terrifying strength\u2026. He was this powerful.\u201dInside the Life and Death Arena, Yu Hao\u2019s face was turning deathly pale. His face had become so pale and cold that he already looked like a corpse.\u201cEven with your sword spirit you don\u2019t understand the basic principles of wielding a sword.\u201dLin Feng had destroyed his honor and dignity. He had no choice but to agree with his statement and he was not the only one. Everybody in the crowd had agreed. Yu Hao didn\u2019t understand basic sword principles. Compared with Lin Feng, he looked like a child holding a toy sword.Who was it that said, only those who had a Sword Spirit could become amazing sword masters?Every single trace of sword Qi emerging from Yu Hao\u2019s body was vanishing as fast as it had appeared. It was crumbling and disintegrating each time he tried to release it. Controlling forces like he did, Lin Feng wasn\u2019t consuming much energy and the sword force was growing extremely powerful.\u201cI give up. You can become an elite disciple.\u201dYu Hao had been struggling with his pride but had finally said those words. He just had the feeling that he had been truly humiliated and that the entire crowd was laughing at him for thinking he was so powerful.\u201cGive up?\u201dLin Feng was smiling coldly. Could he really be let off so easily?When Yu Hao thought his victory was certain and he would easily overpower Lin Feng, he had wanted to cripple Lin Feng\u2019s cultivation. He wanted to break his arms and leave him half dead. It was impossible for him to be crueler than that.At the moment when Yu Hao found out that he couldn\u2019t compete with Lin Feng, he thought that one sentence was going to be enough to purify the hatred between them. Was that how things really worked?Well Lin Feng didn\u2019t agree.\u201cDo I need to accept?\u201d said Lin Feng making fun of his actions. Lin Feng continued moving forwards and the sword force became even more powerful. It was oppressing Yu Hao\u2019s body so much that he could no longer breathe.\u201cI said I give up! What do you want me to do?\u201dYu Hao\u2019s face changed. Lin Feng didn\u2019t stop moving closer. How terrifying.\u201cWhat do I want? That is very simple. I want you to do to yourself what you had said you would do to me.\u201d said Lin Feng with an ice cold smile on his face. Yu Hao was shaking from head to toe. Lin Feng wanted him to cripple his own cultivation and break his own arms. This was a death sentence; he wanted him to commit suicide.\u201cThis is the Elite Disciple Exam of the Yun Hai Sect, how dare you?\u201d shouted Yu Hao.\u201cYou may not dare to kill me, but shall we see if I dare to kill you.\u201dLin Feng was moving closer while replying to Yu Hao. His sword slightly shook. A terrifyingly strong sword Qi invaded the entire atmosphere and shot towards Yu Hao while piercing through the air.A deadly sword which existed solely to take the life of others. In the blink of an eye, Yu Hao\u2019s blood sprayed everywhere. His body collapsed lifelessly on the stage. His eyes were still wide open as if he was shocked at his own death. It looked like he couldn\u2019t believe that Lin Feng had actually dared to kill him.\u201cPhewww\u2026\u2026\u201d It seemed like the atmosphere had become tense. The entire crowd was holding their breath in shock. The arena had become so quiet that they could almost hear each other\u2019s heartbeat.Lin Feng had set a new record in the entire history of the Yun Hai Sect: he had challenged and defeated two Elite Disciples at the same time. He had then ruthlessly killed one of them in front of the entire sect.Lin Feng had violated the rules of the Yun Hai Sect in the presence of every disciple, every elder and even the Patriarch of the Sect Nan Gong Ling. He had killed his opponent during the Elite Disciple Exam.\u201cAudacious!\u201dAn extremely loud shout spread throughout the area. It sounded like it was coming from above. The entire crowd was surprised and had the feeling they had been awoken from a dream as they could barely come to grips with what had just happened.\u201cIn the presence of every member of the Yun Hai Sect. You really have no respect for the rules and no respect for the Patriarch either. You are guilty of crimes for which even death cannot atone.\u201dThere was a loud shout. It sounded like that person really wanted to kill Lin Feng on the spot.The disciples in the crowd raised their heads and saw Mo Xie. Some people didn\u2019t understand what was going on but when they saw Mo Xie, it had become clear. Mo Xie and Lin Feng were enemies and Mo Xie wanted to take advantage of the fact that Lin Feng was still weak. He could not let that young disciple become someone important and grow stronger than himself, if he did then he would surely be killed. Therefore, he directly accused him of various crimes and then said that he had to die for his grave crimes.Lin Feng raised his head and saw Mo Xie. He just glanced at him for a second and then ignored him.He had joined the Elite Disciple Exam, stepped on the highest fighting stage and had amazed the entire crowd. He had challenged two elite disciples at the same time. He had use sword force and had killed Yu Hao on the spot.He had done all of this for Mo Xie!Lin Feng had willingly given Mo Xie an opportunity to find excuses to kill him. He had hoped that Mo Xie would use these excused to confront him. It was clear to Lin Feng that if he didn\u2019t do it himself, Mo Xie would continue to plot against him. Lin Feng had just delivered himself to Mo Xie with a neat ribbon. This was all part of his plan.When Mo Xie saw that Lin Feng was ignoring him, he became so furious that he was shaking from head to toe in anger. However in his heart he was smiling coldly. He shouted: \u201cEverybody, arrest this traitor and if he tries to resist, kill him on the spot.\u201dWhen the crowd heard Mo Xie\u2019s words they were disappointed. He was really beyond shameless. That elder\u2019s behavior was really impudent and cruel. It was clear that he was using his power in the sect to settle personal grudges.\u201cBastard!\u201d cursed Han Man. Everybody had heard him. Yu Hao wanted to cripple Lin Feng\u2019s cultivation then break his arms and leave Lin Feng half dead. Was anything that Lin Feng had done, unjustified?Jing Yun\u2019s face also turned livid. She was so scared for Lin Feng\u2019s safety.\u201cPfff, that Elder is really shameless, what a disgrace!\u201d cursed Liu Fei. Mo Xie had already used this trick once yet was he going to give it another try?A few silhouettes flashed through the air towards the fighting stage ready to catch Lin Feng.\u201cWait! Wait!\u201d shouted a voice which made the silhouettes, who were heading towards Lin Feng, immediately stop. The one who had stopped them was Nan Gong Ling.Everybody turned around and looked at Nan Gong Ling. They were all curious to see how Nan Gong Ling was going to handle the situation. Was he going to punish Lin Feng?\u201cPatriarch, that young disciple is presumptuous and arrogant. You don\u2019t exist in his eyes. You must punish him. It will be a warning for others as well.\u201dMo Xie had come next to Nan Gong Ling and was slightly bowing, showing him respect with the intention to persuade him. He also quickly glanced at the people standing next to Nan Gong Ling.\u201cElder Mo Xie is right. That ordinary disciple is too aggressive. He does not give the sect any respect. He will ruthlessly kill all his fellow disciples. We must kill him.\u201d\u201cPatriarch, his punishment should be death, we should kill him.\u201dA few elders were supporting Mo Xie. Mo Cang Lan had served the Sect for a longer period than Nan Gong Ling. In the Yun Hai Sect, all these elders wanted to give him face so they would obviously jump at the chance to support his son, Mo Xie.Nan Gong Ling raised his head. He looked at Mo Xie and all the elders who were getting involved. He then said indifferently: \u201cHave you finished talking yet?\u201dAll the elders were stupefied. They didn\u2019t know what Nan Gong Ling meant by those words.\u201cMo Xie, are you the Patriarch of this sect? Or is it me, Nan Gong Ling, who is the current Patriarch of this Sect?\u201dHe said that while paying no heed to anyone else but Mo Xie.Mo Xie was speechless. He then hastily replied: \u201cYou, of course. You are the Patriarch. I wouldn\u2019t dare\u2026\u201dHe was then interrupted again.\u201cWhat about all of you, am I the Patriarch of this Sect or is Mo Xie the Patriarch?\u201d asked Nan Gong Ling to the elders who were supporting Mo Xie.\u201cYou, of course.\u201d replied the elders feeling a slight chill run down their spines. Nan Gong Ling was a moderate person and never lost his temper. He had never talked to them in that way, but it was clear at this moment that he was angry.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d said Nan Gong Ling while nodding: \u201cThen I would like to ask you; who is in charge of the Elite Disciple Exam?\u201d\u201cThe Patriarch of course!\u201d replied Mo Xie and the others elders in unison. Their backs were soaked with a cold sweat. They had really picked the wrong time to support Mo Xie.\u201cSo you all know\u2026 Since you all know then I would like to ask you, Mo Xie, you say that in this young disciples eyes the sect is of no importance, then what about you? In my presence, in the presence of every member of the sect you are shouting loudly and trying to act like the Patriarch\u2026 and you even want to handle things of which I am responsible. How imposing! Elder Mo Xie, you tell me, do you even attach any importance to me or the Sect?\u201dNan Gong Ling\u2019s voice dropped in volume. It seemed like there was a cold breeze blowing in the air over the crowd. Mo Xie and the other elders felt that they were in a very bad position.The elders who had been supporting Mo Xie a moment before didn\u2019t say anything which was their only option at this point.Mo Xie thought that because his father was Mo Cang Lan that he could usurp all powers of the sect for himself. Mo Xie\u2019s behavior and words had finally made Nan Gong Ling furious.\u201cCRACK!\u201dA loud noise pierced the silent atmosphere of the arena. The chair on which Nan Gong Ling sat had shattered under the pressure.\u201cSpeak! I want to ask all of you elders, do you still see me, Nan Gong Ling, as the Patriarch of the Yun Hai Sect and am I of any importance in your eyes?\u201dNan Gong Ling stood up and shouted coldly at the elders. He had gone completely insane with anger. The elders felt their hearts drop and fear spread throughout their bodies. What role did they play in the Sect anyway? Could they compare with the patriarch?Everybody was looking at Nan Gong Ling who was furious. His eyes looked like he was calm which made it even more terrifying. His temperament was actually very good and he was never usually angry. What could have caused him to act in such a way? He had suddenly lost temper\u2026 and on top of that it was because of Mo Xie.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had to think carefully about what his next words would be. He bowed respectfully then said: \u201cPatriarch, Mo Xie admits his mistake.\u201dMo Xie and Mo Cang Lan had power in the Yun Hai Sect but Nan Gong Ling was the Patriarch. Nan Gong Ling had become furious at Mo Xie\u2019s actions. Mo Xie had no choice but to admit his mistake.\u201cMaybe I am too aggressive and too arrogant\u2026 Maybe I\u2019ve been disrespectful to the Patriarch\u2026\u201d said Mo Xie while insulting himself and acting humble.When Nan Gong Ling saw that Mo Xie acknowledged his mistakes, he started to calm down. He coldly glanced at Mo Xie and said: \u201cSince you acknowledge your mistake, let\u2019s forget about it this time. If this happens again then there will be no more chances.\u201d\u201cRegarding the disciple on stage, Yu Hao was the first to provoke him and state his intent. He threatened that he would cripple the cultivation of this young disciple then planned to break his arms. He showed no intention of having any mercy and only gave the impression of cruelty. This was then returned onto him.\u201d\u201cBut Patriarch\u2026.\u201d Mo Xie wanted to speak again. He hadn\u2019t understood the reason why Nan Gong Ling was furious after all.\u201cHuh?\u201d Nan Gong Ling glanced at him furiously. Mo Xie swallowed his previous thoughts and forced himself to say: \u201cPatriarch, you are wise and brilliant.\u201dNan Gong Ling groaned, he didn\u2019t really care about what Mo Xie had to say. He then looked at Lin Feng and said: \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201dLin Feng raised his head and looked at Nan Gong Ling. He looked incredibly calm at this moment.\u201cLin Feng.\u201d\u201cLin Feng, good job, you are now an elite disciple of the Yun Hai Sect.\u201d declared Nan Gong Ling. Nan Gong Ling was really impressed by Lin Feng\u2019s abilities and actions. He personally asked Lin Feng his name and personally gave him the status of an elite disciple. Many others would never have that privilege. The other disciples would need to check the results with the elder in charge of the Elite Disciple exam.Lin Feng was smiling from ear to ear. His smile seemed to be filled with a strange feeling which wasn\u2019t gratitude. His smile contained the feeling of accomplishment.\u201cOnly those who are strong enough can demand respect.\u201dNan Gong Ling hadn\u2019t forgotten that Lin Feng had once said words in that respect. At that moment, Lin Feng had showed that he held an extremely strong power and everyone had witnessed it. The question was as to how Nan Gong Ling was going to answer Lin Feng\u2019s actions. He had given Lin Feng the answer he had wanted.Mo Xie had tried to hand Lin Feng over to Lin Qian and Chu Zhan Peng. He hadn\u2019t gotten involved in the incident at that time. He had thought that an ordinary disciple wasn\u2019t worth creating a dispute with an elder. So he had just watched from the sidelines.But this time was different, Mo Xie had wanted to kill Lin Feng again and Nan Gong Ling had stopped him. It was only because Lin Feng had shown that he was truly a genius and proved it by returning with such an incredible increase in power. Nan Gong Ling now knew about the Precipice of Zhangu so he was always going to value Lin Feng. Protector Bei had told him about it when he had wanted to kill Mo Xie. Mo Xie had been humiliated but Nan Gong Ling had actually helped him in a way. Did Mo Xie really want to continue making this talented young disciple his enemy?But\u2026 was that enough for Lin Feng?Obviously it wasn\u2019t. Lin Feng was not satisfied at all. Would he really let someone who had made so many attempts on his life get away with only a slap in the face?When the ferocious beasts had attacked the sect, Mo Xie simply handed Lin Feng over to them without hesitation. Lin Feng didn\u2019t believe that Nan Gong Ling was not aware of these actions. Nan Gong Ling may have been able to overlook these incidents, but could the same be said about Lin Feng?Just a moment ago while in the presence of everyone, Mo Xie had wanted to kill Lin Feng again and Nan Gong Ling had seen it with his own eyes.Had Nan Gong Ling punished Mo Xie? Everyone had the impression that he had but in Lin Feng\u2019s eyes, he had just humiliated Mo Xie. Was Nan Gong Ling just trying to make Lin Feng feel grateful for this minor kindness and make him serve the sect?Lin Feng had never been a servile person. This was his second life and he had almost died at the hands of Mo Xie too many times. Were Nan Gong Ling\u2019s words enough? They were too far from being enough. An elder was an elder and an ordinary disciple was just an ordinary disciple but because Lin Feng had proved to everyone that he was a genius, he was now an elite disciple.\u201cThere is only one solution to this problem. If Mo Xie remains in this sect then I will make my own path, however if he is no longer within the sect then I will stay.\u201dThought Lin Feng. He knew that Nan Gong Ling and the Yun Hai Sect had to choose one person. If they chose him then he would dedicate his life to the Yun Hai Sect. If they chose Mo Xie then not only would he leave the Sect but he would return one day to take his revenge\u2026 because of the hatred that he held for Mo Xie there was no longer a peaceful solution. If the Yun Hai Sect was unable to choose him over Mo Xie. Then he had no other choice but leave the sect.Lin Feng didn\u2019t say what he was thinking. He had hoped that Nan Gong Ling would choose him when the time came. This was only the beginning of the grudge between them. During the Elite Disciple Exam, Lin Feng had already planned how to take care of Mo Xie.Lin Feng stepped down from the fighting stage and looked determined. Each of his steps were filled with firm determination.Nan Gong Ling was observing Lin Feng\u2019s eyes and thought that he looked very mysterious. It was not surprising that this young disciple would have some secrets as many exceptional talents did.\u201cHow strong and mysterious.\u201d\u201cIf I was that strong, I would act the same way that he does\u201d\u201cEven if there were ten disciples who would join me to fight against him, we wouldn\u2019t be able to win.\u201d\u201cLin Feng\u2026 I\u2019ll remember that name.\u201d\u201cWhy would you remember his name? He wouldn\u2019t even recognize you. He\u2019s on a completely different level to us. We are just ordinary disciples. Even the highest ranked Chen Chen is nothing in comparison with him.\u201d\u201cNone of the ordinary disciples are as strong as him. Lin Feng and Chen Chen are worlds apart.\u201dTwo disciples were talking loudly amongst themselves but didn\u2019t know that not far away was someone who looked furious. That person was precisely Chen Chen who was the top ranked ordinary disciple. He was the one who had provoked Lin Feng in the Xing Chen Pavilion and who had been humiliated by Lin Feng.\u201cI\u2019m the best amongst all the ordinary disciples.\u201dChen Chen was thinking about the words he had said to Lin Feng in the Xing Chen Pavilion. Chen Chen had nowhere to hide from the shame he felt from saying those words to Lin Feng. Even though these two disciples were harsh with their words, it was the truth. Chen Chen was nothing in comparison with Lin Feng.Yu Hao was an elite disciple with a sword spirit and he had been killed in a single strike.\u201cMaybe he has forgotten about me completely.\u201d thought Chen Chen feeling hopeless while trying to understand his situation. He was terrified that Lin Feng would seek him out and kill him.Lin Feng didn\u2019t attach any important to Chen Chen and had actually forgotten about him. An ordinary disciple who kept repeating that he was the best amongst all the ordinary disciples probably had limited mental abilities.\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2019re so much stronger than me that it\u2019s actually incredible!\u201d said Han Man who saw Lin Feng. Why was Han Man always so enthusiastic?\u201cLin Feng you are really incredible.\u201d said Jing Yun impressed. She was wondering how Lin Feng practiced and hoped she would get the chance to join him.The disciples surrounding them envied that little group of friends. Han Man and the others were all ordinary disciples but they were very close friends with Lin Feng. They were probably going to mutually benefit from Lin Feng\u2019s rise in status. Han Man and the others also felt happy to have such a friend. They were thinking that it was too bad that they hadn\u2019t met him sooner!Lin Feng shrugged and asked Han Man while smiling: \u201cWhen are you getting onto the fighting stage?\u201d\u201cHehe, good thing that there is nobody on the fighting stage because of your display. It seems like now it\u2019s my turn.\u201d said Han Man while smiling. He then moved towards the Life and Death Arena.Because Lin Feng had just created a huge uproar when he unleashed his power, Han Man felt less pressure to go onto the stage. Everybody was waiting to see what Han Man would do once he got onto the stage.The thing which shocked the crowd even more was that Han Man, like Lin Feng had no clue how to be subtle. He surprisingly stepped onto the highest fighting stage. Everyone, including Lin Feng, was shocked. What a brave guy\u2026\u2026\u201cI did not really think about these things beforehand. Does anyone of the first Ling Qi layer want to come and fight me?\u201dHan Man was standing on the fighting stage as he asked the crowd. His manner of speaking sounded so rude that everybody was speechless. He was either completely clueless or he was indeed another genius!!Lin Feng had challenged two elite disciples at the same time but he knew what he was doing and he had chosen his own opponents. Han Man was the complete opposite of Lin Feng, He didn\u2019t know any elite disciples names and was challenging anyone who wished to fight against him. This was the first time that such a thing had happened in the whole of the sects thousand year history.Lin Feng was speechless as he stared shocked at Han Man. His jaw had hit the floor and he was stupefied by Han Man\u2019s actions.\u201cHee Heee\u201d Jing Yun couldn\u2019t help but giggle. That big goofball was hopeless.The entire arena was completely silent for a while until an elite disciple stepped onto the fighting stage and said: \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll fight against you.\u201d\u201cThank you, my name is Han Man.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Wang Han.\u201d\u201cI like people who are quick to accept a challenge. Let\u2019s fight.\u201d said Han Man while laughing loudly.An extremely strong Qi emerged from the earth beneath his feet. In the blink of an eye Han Man\u2019s body had transformed and looked like it was made completely from compact earth. In the Life and Death Arena at this moment, he was one with Mother Earth and Mother Earth was one with him. He had completely fused with the earth and become a symbiotic force.\u201cBOOOOM!!!\u201dHan Man took a step forward and the entire arena began to shake under his feet. It sounded like a thousand foot giant was walking and each of his steps made the ground tremble. The disciples who were watching from the crowd felt their hearts begin to race, some with excitement and others with fear. An incredible force suddenly crashed onto Wang Han\u2019s body and it felt like he was being crushed.\u201cHe has mastered his use of force too!\u201d thought Nan Gong Ling whose eyes were sparkling with delight. There were no words to describe his shock and joy. It wasn\u2019t surprising that Lin Feng could use forces but that unknown ordinary disciple could use forces as well. Even though he had to rely on his spirit and clearly didn\u2019t understand forces to the same extent as Lin Feng, he could use and control them with an extraordinary strength. He could be regarded as another genius within the sect.\u201cHaha, it\u2019s incredible. It\u2019s fantastic. The Yun Hai Sect hasn\u2019t seen such strong young disciples for many years and now two shocking geniuses have appeared at the same time.\u201dNan Gong Ling felt an incredible surge of joy in his heart. This was without a doubt his best Elite Disciple Exam. The sect would actually rise to new heights within his generation.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 - Liu Fei\u2019s strange behaviorPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the Xue Yue Country there were a great number of sects and clans fighting for supremacy. Achieving power was not an easy thing to do as the competition was fierce.The Imperial Clan was the strongest clan that existed in the whole Xue Yue Country. They were so powerful that nobody dared to challenge their authority. There was no room to question the authority of the Imperial Clan.Apart from the Imperial Clan there are also some other extremely powerful clans in the Imperial City. There were the Yue Clan of the Imperial City, the Yu Clan and the Wan Shou Men Clan.Outside of the Imperial City there were also the extremely strong sects which held a great deal of power. The Yun Hai Sect and the Hao Yue Sect were both strong sects which were outside of the imperial city\u2019s borders. There was also the Luo Xia Sect as well as the Ice and Snow Mountain Village.There are eight high officials of the Xue Yue Country who represent the strongest and the most gifted young cultivators within the country. Everyone who is within those eight officials is incredibly strong and has advanced to a high level of cultivation. The future of the country was held by these eight young cultivators. The Yun Hai Sect was a great power, but it did not have anyone who qualified for a position as one of the eight high officials.Even though a high official was extremely powerful and had an incredibly high status, it wasn\u2019t enough to affect the foundation of a sect. However in ten or twenty years that may not be the case. The foundation may be strong, but over time it can be shaken.Nan Gong Ling clearly understood how things worked with the politics of the country. Even if there was no sign of a sect declining in power, what about its future prospects? What if there were no suitable successors to take the place of patriarch? What if the general power of the sect members declined? If these events happened over an extended period of time then the end of the sect was inevitable. The effects would not show in the short term, however in the long term it was clear that the sect would fade from existence.This was the case of the Yun Hai Sect at the moment. The general level of strength that the young disciples of the Yun Hai Sect possessed was clearly in decline. Over the years they were attracting less and less talented individuals. How could Nan Gong Ling not be worried in such circumstances? This was something which troubled him for every second of every day.The fact that Lin Feng and Han Man stood before him and unleashed such spectacular talent, he has once again regained hope. He could feel that the fate of the Yun Hai Sect was changing and it could possibly have a prosperous future.Lin Feng had incredible fighting power and his talent was truly unfathomable, he was a genius. With more time and dedication to practice, he could become one of the eight high officials. This would create a bright new future for the Yun Hai Sect, with him they would rise in power once again.The Yun Hai Sect was going through a period of prosperity during these peaceful times however if a conflict came about then they would be in a very dangerous position. The sect was currently in decline and its strength paled to that of the past generations.\u201cI hope that they can both climb to the top of the hierarchy within the Yun Hai Sect.\u201d thought Nan Gong Ling while looking at Han Man on the fighting stage. In the Imperial City, the construction of the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue had already started and he now had these talent to nurture, wasn\u2019t this a good omen?\u201cBOOOM!\u201dHan Man took another step. In the Life and Death Arena there were waves of yellow sand which were surrounding and covering Wang Han, he was struggling to breathe under such immense pressure. The Qi which was being released was so powerful that Wang Han felt like he was being buried alive where he stood.\u201cYou win. Congratulations on joining the elite disciples.\u201d Said Wang HanWang Han suddenly was able to breathe again. His body felt light and the pressure which was burying him had completely vanished. His eyes were half closed and voice was filled with disappointment in his lack of strength. He had been defeated. He had been humiliated but he had also gained valuable insight thanks to the battle with Han Man.\u201cHaha, brother, don\u2019t be so disappointed. I just exploited the fact that my spirit is very powerful.\u201d said Han Man while the Qi around his body was slowly disappearing. Han Man looked and sounded honest. It was very hard to find a grudge against such a simple person. He could instantly become friendly with anyone.\u201cThank you.\u201d said Wang Han while nodding at Han Man. He turned around and left the fighting stage. The final result was his defeat. That was a humiliation for any elite disciple and he did not want to stay in the spotlight any longer.Han Man quickly rushed back to Lin Feng and while looking incredibly happy with himself he said: \u201cHow was it? I earned everyone\u2019s respect right?\u201d\u201cNot bad.\u201d said Lin Feng while smiling and nodding. Han Man had a good grasp of forces which he could control with the help of his spirit. Against somebody of the same level, Han Man clearly had a huge advantage in power and understanding. It would be very hard to find a cultivator on his level which could fight equally with him. Only those who possessed incredible talent would have a chance to defeat him.Lin Feng and the others stayed at the stormy gorge and continued to watch the other battles. There was always the chance for a cultivator to gain insight from watching a battle. There is not always such a great opportunity to watch so many battles at once.\u201cI would like to challenge Tu Fu today. He is extremely strong. I hope that with my power I will be able to defeat him and join the ranks of core disciples.\u201dHan Man had eyes filled with awe at the end of the first round and he wasn\u2019t the only one. Many disciples were amazed at the battles they had the opportunity to watch. Tu Fu\u2019s battle was too amazing. Tu Fu was much too powerful, He had only used one punch which made even the heavens shake and the fight was already over.\u201cLin Feng do you have anyone that you would like to defeat within the core disciples?\u201d asked Han Man.\u201cMe?\u201d asked Lin Feng surprised. He then shook his head while smiling and said: \u201cI haven\u2019t thought that far ahead yet.\u201dLin Feng really hadn\u2019t thought that far ahead. A great majority of the ordinary disciples of the Yun Hai Sect were only at the Qi layer. If they wanted to become elite disciples then they would at least need to have broken through to the Ling Qi layer.The first Ling Qi layer was the minimum requirement for elite disciples. The elite disciples who had broken through to the third Ling Qi layer were exceptionally strong individuals. Those who had broken through to the fourth Ling Qi layer would have the qualifications to join the core disciples.However the core disciples of the fourth Ling Qi layer were considered weak compared to the other core disciple. Those who joined the core disciples also had had to go through the same process of defeating one of the current core disciples. However who were the core disciples? They were the foundation of the sect and defeating even the weakest of them was not an easy task.Every year, many disciples tried to advance during the Elite Disciple Exam. There was only a single chance for a disciple every year. This exam was the only chance they had to move to a new disciple ranking.There were many elite disciples between the first and the fourth Ling Qi layer. Only the ones with incredible talent or battle power could join the core disciples.Lin Feng had three spirits thanks to all the suffering he had been put through. He was thinking about difference between elite disciples and core disciples. Even if he joined core disciples, so what? Mo Xie was still an elder and held a huge advantage over him.The first round of the Elite Disciple Exam came to end and there were many lively discussions happening within the crowd. It was hard for many of the disciples to hold their excitement for the second round which would be in three days time.All the elite disciples and the core disciples would use all of their power in the upcoming battles as it would decide their rankings within the sect. Holding the highest ranking within the disciples was an honor for any disciple.Lin Feng didn\u2019t want to wait around any longer. He immediately headed towards the practice area for elite disciples. He was now an elite disciple. He needed to get his new disciple robes as well as a certificate of entry into the elite disciples. These were of symbolic of the status a person held within the sect.\u201cLin Feng.\u201dAt that moment, Lin Feng heard a voice coming from behind which made him stop. He turned around and saw such a beauty running towards him.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d asked Lin Feng to Liu Fei who was walking towards him. He was a bit surprised to see her.\u201cCan I talk to you in private?\u201dLiu Fei looked embarrassed when she looked at Han Man and the others.Talk in private\u2026Lin Feng was really puzzled. What could Liu Fei have to tell him that required to talk in private?Even though Lin Feng\u2019s opinion of Liu Fei had completely changed since she had tried to protect him against Mo Xie, his opinion had not changed to such an extent. Were they close enough that they could talk in private?\u201cHaha of course there would be no problem. Lin Feng, we have an important matter to handle now. We will head off first and you can join us later.\u201dLin Feng hadn\u2019t said anything yet but Han Man had already replied for him. He also hastily pulled Po Jun and Jing Yun away from the couple. Lin Feng was speechless. Since when had Han Man become so cunning?They had an important matter? What did he mean? Going to receive the elite disciple certificate and a new set of robes?Liu Fei was already standing next to Lin Feng and had become very embarrassed. She quickly said: \u201cLet\u2019s move to somewhere private where we can talk.\u201dLin Feng slightly nodded. He was really curious to know what Liu Fei could have to tell him.\u201cLin Feng, do you remember the first time we met?\u201d\u201cI remember. You almost killed me for no reason on that day.\u201d said Lin Feng. That girl\u2019s strength was incredible and there was something hidden deep within her. However she was really to rash and viscous.\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t tried to peep on me and do perverted things then would have I tried to kill you?\u201d said Liu Fei who was suddenly in a bad mood.\u201cI never peeped on you or had any perverted intentions.\u201d replied Lin Feng who was also growing angry at Liu Fei. On that day, when he had gone into the mountains it had really been a coincidence. How could she categorically state that Lin Feng was a pervert?\u201cYou\u2026..\u201d Liu Fei saw that Lin Feng wasn\u2019t going to admit it. That bastard was really evil.Lin Feng actually thought that Liu Fei was really beautiful but he did not even know she was there, that was a fact. She really was one of the most beautiful girls in the sect though so it was understandable that many people wanted to peep on her.\u201cAlright, I admit that I was wrong, I misunderstood you. I would like to apologize.\u201dLiu Fei was gnashing her teeth and had forced the words out from her mouth. If it was not for her father, she would never have come to Lin Feng.\u201cEhhh\u2026\u201d Lin Feng couldn\u2019t understand Liu Fei. He stared blankly at her while trying to understand what had just happened.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d asked Liu Fei.Lin Feng was still staring at her. She was embarrassed and she was blushing which had caught Lin Feng by surprise. Could it be\u2026\u201cDid you\u2026\u2026.\u201d Lin Feng was strangely looking at Liu Fei. He was gazing deeply into her beautiful eyes.\u201cDid you\u2026\u2026. fall for me?\u201d Lin Feng had finally managed to say what had come into his mind. He could not stop all of the thoughts that were rushing through his head. Liu Fei was incredibly strange and tomboyish, but she was beautiful and had an interest in Lin Feng. Lin Feng had never had a girlfriend so he couldn\u2019t help but feel very embarrassed at his current situation.Liu Fei was stunned. She had finally lost her temper and shouted: \u201cYou Bastard!\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 - ProvocationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLin Feng simply shrugged and smiled. He couldn\u2019t be blamed for thinking that way because Liu Fei was acting so strangely.Liu Fei was looking at Lin Feng and her heart was pounding in her chest. She couldn\u2019t help but gnash her teeth. She had never been so furious but she had to control herself.\u201cThere is something I would like to discuss with you.\u201dSaid Liu Fei, she then fell dead silent. Her face had turned red and she tried to open her mouth but there were no words coming out.\u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d asked Lin Feng surprised.\u201cDo you know who the strongest people are in the Xue Yue Country?\u201d asked Liu Fei.\u201cOf course I know, it\u2019s the Imperial Clan.\u201d Lin Feng replied immediately. Lin Feng knew that the Imperial Clan were the strongest and there was not a person who would dare contest that. This is why they so easily ruled over the country. Only the strongest person could become Emperor and only with power could they control the country. This was a fact.Liu Fei was surprised. She didn\u2019t know that Lin Feng was so knowledgeable about the subject. He had responded so quickly without even taking time to think.\u201cThat\u2019s right. In the Xue Yue Country the Imperial Clan is the strongest. Even though there are extremely strong clans and sects within the country like the Yun Hai Sect, there is not a single power that would dare to face against the imperial clan.\u201d Liu Fei explained. \u201cHowever, now the Emperor has requested some of the outstanding disciples of the Xue Yue Country to help develop the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue. They will receive the best cultivation resources available and the best teachers will be available to them. They will develop into incredible powers for the country and they will become leaders in the future.\u201dAt that moment, Liu Fei stopped talking and looked at Lin Feng\u2019s reaction.Lin Feng looked at Liu Fei while smiling and ask: \u201cWhat does that have to do with me?\u201dLiu Fei looked at Lin Feng with anger building up inside her. She was cursing at him under her breath. He was extremely smart and she didn\u2019t believe for even a second that he didn\u2019t understand what she wanted.\u201cSo you\u2019re not interested in going there? Are you not interested in getting the best profound pills, the best weapons, the best martial skills and agility techniques?\u201d said Liu Fei while trying to convince him.Lin Feng had understood what Liu Fei meant. She was being very obvious with her intentions. However what he was trying to figure out was Liu Fei and exactly what was in it for her. What was her relation with the Imperial Clan and why would she need to come and recruit on their behalf?When he thought of the day when he had seen Liu Fei with the Chi Xue armored horses, he believed even more than Liu Fei held an extraordinary status within the Imperial City.Liu Fei saw Ling Feng\u2019s eyes were sparkling with intrigue, she then smiled and said: \u201cSo, how does it sound? Are you excited?\u201dLin Feng scratched his head while looking at Liu Fei and said with a giggle: \u201cAre there any girls as beautiful as you there?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen Lin Feng saw that Liu Fei was blushing, he laughed and started walking away.\u201cEven though the Imperial Clan is extremely strong, there are also other clans who are very ambitious. The Imperial Clan wants them to hand over their best disciples and go to the Holy Courtyard\u2026 Do you really believe that it will be so simple?\u201dAfter these words left Lin Feng\u2019s mouth it caused Liu Fei to stare at him with a stunned expression. He really was much smarter than she had initially imagined. No wonder he had managed to advance his strength in such a short period of time. He was a real genius. But this bastard was making her lose face.Liu Fei was in a bad mood because of what Lin Feng had said. If she had the chance then she would definitely defeat that bastard and make him regret everything. That would be her revenge for constantly getting ridiculed by him. She had started following him as he left.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Nine Frost Mountain was the name of the place where the elite disciples lived.In the Nine Frost Mountain, there was a gigantic cave which was popular with the elite disciples because of a certain cliff.At the top of the precipice, engraved in the stone were a list of names. Those names were the names of the strongest elite disciples. There were eighty names in total which were carved into the stone.What intrigued people the most is that it looked like a chess board. Each of the eighty names was like a chess piece which could be moved across the board. Some names would be eliminated, while other insignificant pieces would cross the board and transform into powerful pieces.All of the elite disciples within the sect hoped that their name could be engraved on that board someday. It would mean that they had finally reached the top and would be respected by all.At that moment, Tu Fu\u2019s name which was at the top of the list was removed. They all understood what was happening. He was one of the first people to become a core disciple and he had even defending his right to be a core disciple.Then, a new name replaced Tu Fu\u2019s name on the list of the elite disciples.\u201cWen Ren Yan.\u201dHis name had appeared there suddenly like a comet which had crashed through to the top position. He had only needed a year and he was already at the top of the elite disciple rankings. Everybody knew of his strength. He had the power to join the core disciples but he decided to stay as an elite disciple. Everybody knew the reason why he had done such a thing. He did not want to join the core disciples because he was too arrogant and refused to be lowly ranked amongst the core disciples. He would rather rule over the elite disciples than be kicked around by the core disciples.Wen Ren Yan was sixteen years old. There were many young disciples in the Yun Hai Sect who were exceptionally talented. He had never been an ordinary disciple because he had directly joined as an elite disciple. Once he joined the elite disciples he had been fighting intensively and his name had constantly been rising up in the rankings. A year had passed and his name was already carved into the top stone on the board.Many people trusted Wen Ren Yan and believed in his power. He had achieved a great deal of accomplishments in the year he spent fighting his way to the top. He could even be compared to people like Ling Hu He Shan or Fu Tu.Outside of the cave a group of people had arrived. All of the disciples there were looking at this group with respect filling their eyes.\u201cWen Ren Yan has arrived.\u201dAmongst the group was a young man wearing a white Chang Pao. He looked incredibly arrogant yet powerful. He had deep blue eyes and had a strangely cold looking face. This young man was Wen Ren Yan.\u201cWen Ren, congratulations!\u201d said a disciple standing next to him while smiling.\u201cThe top ranking amongst the elite disciples\u2026 that\u2019s all I have achieved.\u201d replied Wen Ren Yan expressionless. He glanced at his name on the stone and said: \u201cChen Xing, considering your current strength, you should also have your name carved onto that ranking list.\u201d\u201cYes, I will do my best.\u201d said Chen Xing while nodding. Chen Xing was the elite disciple that had been defeated by Lin Qian in front of everybody when she came to the sect. Since then, Chen Xing had been practicing harder than he had ever practiced before. He wasn\u2019t far from breaking through to the second Ling Qi layer. He was also considered a young genius. He was quite respected amongst the elite disciples. Even Wen Ren Yan respected him and his determination.\u201cHehe.\u201d Wen Ren Yan smiled. Immediately after, he glanced at the crowd. His blues were sparkling with a strange light.\u201cFrom today, I declare that Liu Fei is officially mine. If anyone tries to flirt with her then do not blame me for being ruthless.\u201dEverybody sighed when they heard what Wen Ren Yan had said. He had been interested in Liu Fei for a while and now that he was the strongest within the elite disciples, he had wanted to prevent others from approaching Liu Fei.Wen Ren Yan was actually insane to say such a thing because everybody knew that he had only refused to join the core disciples because he wanted to remain as the top elite disciple. However there were many strong core disciples who were interested in Liu Fei. In Liu Fei\u2019s eyes, Wen Ren Yan didn\u2019t even exist.The entire crowd was speechless when suddenly a loud voice was heard within the crowd.\u201cHow can you say that Liu Fei is yours when what you say is of such little importance? We want to hear Liu Fei say it herself.\u201d Han Man knew that Lin Feng and Liu Fei were together at that moment. He got angry when he heard what Wen Ren Yan had so boldly declared.\u201cHuh?\u201d everybody was surprised.\u201cWho was that audacious guy who dares provoke Wen Ren Yan? Does he want to die?\u201dThe crowd was whispering amongst themselves. Not only was Wen Ren Yan extremely strong but he was also respected within the Yun Hai Sect. Even some of the core disciples didn\u2019t dare provoke him.\u201cVery good.\u201d said Wen Ren Yan while turning around. His blue eyes revealed his murderous intention. Immediately an image of a poisonous snake shot from his hand.\u201cBOOOM!\u201dHan Man\u2019s body was thrown against the wall of the cliff. Blood was spilling out of his mouth. His eyes had an insolent expression as if he wasn\u2019t going to obey.\u201cIf you say another word, I\u2019ll kill you where you stand.\u201dWen Ren Yan sounded calm and serene but also firm.\u201cPiss off.\u201d Han Man said while spitting out blood. He was staring coldly at Wen Ren Yan and said: \u201cDon\u2019t think that you\u2019re strong because you needed one year to reach the top of the ranking. When my brother arrives he will wipe your name from the list in no time.\u201d\u201cHuh? Who\u2019s your brother then? Tell me.\u201d Wen Ren Yan said as his words were filled with disdain.\u201cLin Feng, Liu Fei\u2019s boyfriend.\u201dHan Man had said this on purpose. After what happened during the Exam where Lin Feng had dared to kill an elite disciple in front of everyone including the elders, Han Man was convinced that no one would dare provoke Lin Feng so easily. He was also sure that Lin Feng would not need much time before he had surpassed Wen Ren Yan. Han Man was convinced that Lin Feng could defeat him in less than a year.\u201cWho\u2019s Lin Feng?\u201dWen Ren Yan said that indifferently. He hadn\u2019t bothered to go to the Exam on that day, he knew that nobody would dare to challenge him because he was one of the strongest elite disciples.\u201cSomeone who has just broke through to the Ling Qi layer but has already mastered forces. He is nothing compared to you.\u201dChen Xing said full of disdain.\u201cOh, is that really what you think?\u201dSuddenly a voice echoed through the silence as two figures appeared in the distance.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 - The PunishmentPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySuddenly, everybody gazed into the distance and tried to make out the figures of the people who were approaching.The beautiful Liu Fei was approaching. But who was that young man that she was following?What shocked everybody at that moment is that Liu Fei together with this young disciple and they had been alone together. This young man was actually Lin Feng. Many people had seen Lin Feng in the Life and Death Arena as he killed an elite disciple in cold blood and they made sure to remember his face. Many had made a mental note to not offend this young disciple in the future.The voice which had interrupted them was actually Lin Feng\u2019s voice.\u201cCould it be that it was true and Lin Feng is actually Liu Fei\u2019s boyfriend?\u201dEverybody was thinking about the words of Han Man and they were paying close attention to Wen Ren Yan.But Wen Ren Yan still had a calm look on his face as if he was not affected. His blues however were revealing his evil intentions. It was clear he would not let this matter rest.\u201cSo, you are the new little elite disciple, Lin Feng?\u201d said Wen Ren Yan with a hint of disdain in his voice. He was talking down to Lin Feng and attempting to humiliate him.What surprised him is that it seemed like Lin Feng had completely ignored his presence. He just glanced at him for a second and continued over to Han Man who was still in a bad condition.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d\u201cI just have a small injury. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d said Han Man while smiling and now he was also ignoring Wen Ren Yan.\u201cDon\u2019t start so many fights. I do not want to see you die.\u201d said Lin Feng glaring at Han Man. This simple minded disciple was a trouble maker, he could not stop himself from causing trouble. A moment before, he had said that Liu Fei was Lin Feng\u2019s girlfriend. Liu Fei would be furious after hearing such a thing.\u201cThat guy is insane. He\u2019s saying to everyone that Liu Fei belongs to him.\u201d said Han Man sounding angry. Liu Fei was furious and quickly glanced at Wen Ren Yan.At that moment, Wen Ren Yan was frowning. He could not believe that a disciple who had just broken through to the Ling Qi Layer could be as insane as to ignore him. Within the Yun Hai Sect nobody had ever dared to provoke him, not even the elders of the sect would ignore him when he spoke.\u201cLet me ask, have you been listening to what I have said?\u201d Said Wen Ren Yan.It suddenly seemed like the entire area was growing colder. Everybody was looking at Lin Feng. That guy was an incredible genius who was able to control sword force but he was far from being able to challenge Wen Ren Yan. It looked like Wen Ren Yan was going to have to teach him how large the world truly is.\u201cLet him continue to talk with himself. He has a big mouth so it is easy to ignore him when he speaks. It\u2019s unfortunate that you can only ignore him, it would be better if he would stop talking.\u201d said Lin Feng to the others while ignoring Wen Ren Yan. He continued talking to Han Man: \u201cWhen he says that Liu Fei is his? So what? That is none of my business.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHan Man was staring at Lin Feng and was shocked speechless. Han Man was doing this out of loyalty for Lin Feng. He knew that they were secretly a couple and he was still trying to hide it.\u201cI\u2026 want\u2026 to\u2026. ask\u2026. you\u2026 something\u2026\u201dWen Ren Yan had said this sentence very slowly emphasizing each word with a voice filled with anger. A strong Qi was spreading through the air. In front of the whole crowd, Lin Feng was still ignoring him and causing him to lose face in front of such a large crowd.\u201cI heard you.\u201d said Lin Feng turning around his head. He then looked at Wen Ren Yan and said: \u201cYou\u2019re asking me if I\u2019m Lin Feng, is that right?\u201d\u201cHmph, so you\u2019re not deaf.\u201d said Wen Ren Yan while smiling coldly.\u201cSince you ask me who I am, it means you don\u2019t know me, right?\u201dWen Ren Yan was staring at Lin Feng confused, he was asking such an obvious question. Did Lin Feng have a defect in his brain?\u201cSuch nonsense.\u201d Said Wen Ren Yan.\u201cNonsense? Maybe. Since we do not know each other. Why should I waste my time speaking with you?\u201d Said Lin Feng as he looked at Wen Ren Yan and added \u201cWhat are you going to do about it?\u201dWhen he finished talking an immense Qi emerged and filled the atmosphere.Madness!Everybody was stunned. Lin Feng was actually insane enough to fight with Wen Ren Yan. That guy was really crazy! He was courting death!Wen Ren Yan looked deathly pale. It was the first time that someone had dared to talk with him like that.\u201cLin Feng, You are dreaming if you think you can fight against Wen Ren, you will die for sure. You shouldn\u2019t have provoked Wen Ren.\u201d said Chen Xing while staring at Lin Feng.\u201cChen Xing, do you think you are a top ranked disciple? You obviously think that you\u2019re a genius but not so long ago you were defeated by Lin Qian when she had just broken through to the Ling Qi Layer. Everybody watched how you lost so pitifully and yet you call yourself a genius? You are far from a genius in my eyes.\u201dLin Feng said with a calm face as if he was talking normally but it had made Chen Xing furious. He had been badly humiliated by a nobody disciple.\u201cThat guy really has a big mouth.\u201d thought Liu Fei while looking at Lin Feng who had made both Wen Ren Yan and Chen Xing furious with his words. She was wondering why Lin Feng acted in the ways that he did.\u201cYou are insulting me and attempting to bully me because I only recently reached the Ling Qi layer. Well let\u2019s solve this problem in the Stormy Gorge in the Life And Death Arena. Do you dare?\u201dStormy Gorge, Life and Death Arena, did he dare?!Lin Feng was challenging Chen Xing to a battle in the Life and Death Arena where the rules were more relaxed. In the Arena they would forfeit the protection granted by the sect and could really lose their life.A strong Qi was constantly emerging from Lin Feng\u2019s body and he sounded extremely confident. Chen Xing was stunned at such actions. Chen Xing was at the second Ling Qi layer and was so strong that he would soon have his name engraved onto the ranking list. But Lin Feng\u2019 words had stunned him. How could Lin Feng be so self confident and arrogant?In the Life and Death Arena, did he dare?He was trying to relax but his heart was pounding.\u201cHow can you be so confident in challenging me? Is it because of your Sword force?\u201d asked Chen Xing.\u201cSword force is indeed extremely powerful. Yu Hao wasn\u2019t weak but he had been killed from a single strike. Even if Yu Hao had been stronger, the result would have still been the same.\u201d\u201cI cannot be sure that he used all of his strength during that fight. If he is much stronger than what he has already shown during the fight against Yu Hao, will I be able to fight against him?\u201dChen Xing\u2019s thought were racing and he was considering every possible situation. He had a weird expression on his face, he was straining his face and he looked like an idiot. He had already lost against Lin Qian in front of a large crowd. He could not afford to lose face again.\u201cSo ridiculous\u2026 and you used to be the top ranked ordinary disciple? You think you\u2019re important because you became an elite disciple with such little strength? You haven\u2019t made any progress and you are still weak in cultivation and willpower. A strong cultivator is firm and persistent. A strong cultivator takes the path of cultivation seriously. On the path of cultivation, relying on other people\u2019s success will never allow you to reach the top.\u201dLin Feng saw how ugly Chen Xing\u2019s face looked. The Qi surrounding Lin Feng\u2019s body shot towards Chen Xing and started to apply pressure on his body. Lin Feng started walking slowly towards him. He was walking very slowly, one step after the other. Chen Xing was scared to death. He could barely breathe under the pressure of Lin Feng\u2019s Qi and he could feel a deathly chill running down his spine.\u201cA strong cultivator is firm and persistent\u2026 is strong\u2026 and takes the path of Cultivation seriously.\u201d these words were resonating in Chen Xing\u2019s head. He used to work harder than anyone else to cultivate and everybody used to think he was a genius because of that. Then when he started to associate with Wen Ren Yan, his speed had dropped and he was slacking. He felt inferior to Wen Ren Yan and had lost his motivation to grow stronger.Was he able to regain his former glory and self confidence that he used to hold so dear?Chen Xing wasn\u2019t the only who felt affected by Lin Feng\u2019s words. Other disciples in the crowd who had heard his words were feeling bad about their own choices.\u201cHe is speaking very wise words and his words are having a profound impact on everyone who hears him.\u201d Liu Fei was also affected by Lin Feng\u2019s words. He really was a genius in so many ways. He was so unconventional and unrestrained, he really had nothing servile in his personality.\u201cChen Xing, come on. Are you not ashamed of yourself? Provoking others while being rude and then not daring to fight? If you refuse then not only will you prove that you are not a genius but you will also prove that you are a coward.\u201d Lin Feng said while he continued walking towards Chen Xing. An incredible force was oppressing Chen Xing\u2019s body and soul.\u201cCoward\u2026. Coward\u2026..\u201d that word was resonating in Chen Xing\u2019s brain and it was like torture for him. His face was completely distorted in pain.\u201cAahhhh\u2026..\u201d Suddenly, Chen Xing shouted loudly. Some disciples had to cover their ears.Everybody was staring blankly at the scene that was occurring in astonishment.How powerful was Lin Feng!Lin Feng didn\u2019t even need to fight. Chen Xing had only said a few words and was already about to collapse because of the pressure that Lin Feng was applying. How could he fight when he could not even speak under the pressure.At that moment, the entire crowd was looking at Lin Feng and only saw that he had a cold smile on his face. He looked like a dangerous ferocious beast. His eyes looked so dark that it gave the impression that he was no longer human.Lin Feng had abilities similar to that of the Imaginary Demon. He had a mystical power. He had used that power on Chen Xing.\u201cPiece of trash.\u201d said Wen Ren Yan. His azure blue eyes were staring angrily at Lin Feng.\u201cEven though you\u2019re a little bit stronger than Chen Xing, you\u2019re still extremely weak in comparison with me. You are nothing but a bug which I can crush at any time. Now, kneel down and beg me for mercy or I will crush you here and now.\u201dWen Ren Yan said in an ice cold tone filled with killing intent. Lin Feng had said that it was useless to rely on somebody else\u2019s power. He was going to teach Lin Feng a lesson and make him kneel down before him.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 - ConfrontationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt seemed like Lin Feng hadn\u2019t heard Wen Ren Yan. He actually didn\u2019t care about what he was saying. Lin Feng was used to people who talked big but in the end did not have the strength to match their arrogance.\u201cHan Man, is he the one who injured you?\u201d asked Lin Feng to Han Man. Wen Ren Yan was indeed the person who had attacked Han Man and caused him to be injured.\u201cYes.\u201d said Han Man while nodding. He then whispered in Lin Feng\u2019s ears: \u201cWen Ren Yan is not even close to the strength of Tu Fu. So now that Tu Fu has become a core disciple, he is currently ranked first within the elite disciples. He\u2019s strong and has a fierce temper. I\u2019m not in a hurry to get my revenge on him. I believe that in a short time, you will definitely be able to defeat him.\u201dHe was strong?An elite disciple who had broken through to the third Ling Qi layer could be ranked amongst the top disciples with no difficulty. Those who had broken through to the fourth Ling Qi layer were strong enough to fight against the core disciples of the sect. If Wen Ren Yan had broken through to the fourth Ling Qi layer then he definitely wouldn\u2019t have stayed as an elite disciple and would have become a core disciple. So at that moment he was most likely at the peak of the third Ling Qi layer. He would not have had a breakthrough yet to the forth Ling Qi Layer.A cultivator of that level was indeed very powerful but that did not mean that he was invincible and could provoke who he wished. Lin Feng was confident that if he had to fight with him then he would be able to win and if he was not able to fight against him then he could retreat unharmed.\u201cNo need to discuss any more. This is the only chance I will give you. Even if you\u2019re a genius, I can take your life at any time. Now kneel before me.\u201dWen Ren Yan thought that he was the strongest and his arrogance was clear. He truly did not know how vast the world was. He thought that because Lin Feng had just become an elite disciple that he was weak and could be bullied. To Wen Ren Yan who would even dare to fight against some core disciples he was really nothing but a bug. Even though Lin Feng understood a lot about forces, he was too weak. There would be no problem to defeat Lin Feng with a single thought.Wen Ren Yan had an extremely strong spirit. It would in no way be weaker than the sword force of Lin Feng. Wen Ren Yan had an unbreakable faith in the strength of his spirit.\u201cThere is no need to think it over.\u201d said Lin Feng while shaking his head and then while giving a cold smile, he said: \u201cEven though you want me to kneel down and beg you for mercy, I have no reason to obey you.\u201dEverybody was stupefied by Lin Feng\u2019s words. He was aggressive and would not retreat no matter who he faced. He truly had the demeanor of an emperor.Wen Ren Yan was the top ranked elite disciple. He was respected by everyone and feared for his strength. What did he think of Lin Feng? He only just become an elite disciple and was no better than those bugs called ordinary disciples.\u201cHehe. Alright\u2026 Alright\u2026.\u201d Wen Ren Yan said with an evil smile which was filled with hatred. His azure blue eyes were emanating a strong killing intent which made other disciples tremble in fear.\u201cThis is terrible! Wen Ren Yan has become furious.\u201dSome disciples in the crowd knew that this had become a very dangerous situation. They were very scared of Wen Ren Yan. Nobody dared provoke him because of his strength and also because of his temper.Lin Feng also sensed the cold air which was emanating from Wen Ren Yan\u2019s body. Lin Feng didn\u2019t sense it in the same way though. He felt that there was a diabolic and evil intention held within his eyes.\u201cWen Ren Yan, what do you intend to do? You are not in the Life and Death Arena.\u201d said Liu Fei while moving in front of Lin Feng to block the way.Wen Ren Yan said that Liu Fei was his and declared that no one else could attempt romance with her. In fact, they hadn\u2019t known each other for a long time but Liu Fei had already come to an understanding of what kind of person he really way. He looked strong and confident on the outside but he was like a venomous snake. He did not have the honor and morals which other had.Liu Fei still wanted Lin Feng to go to the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue. Therefore she didn\u2019t want him to die from his current situation. In Liu Fei\u2019s opinion, Lin Feng wasn\u2019t weak but could never fight against Wen Ren Yan. If he fought against him, he would surely die.\u201cYou are mine and yet you protect this young man, are you not afraid to make me angry?\u201dWen Ren Yan looked hideously evil at that moment. It looked like his azure blue eyes alone could kill if you gazed into them for too long. They clearly revealed his murderous intentions.\u201cI\u2019ve never said that I was your girlfriend or that I was your property. Stop dreaming. I would never be in a relationship with a guy like you. It\u2019s actually the opposite. Lin Feng is my boyfriend. If you touch him, I will never let you off.\u201dLiu Fei was staring at Wen Ren Yan looking extremely serious.\u201cOh my, so that\u2019s how it is. Liu Fei admits that she is Lin Feng\u2019s girlfriend. What a lucky bastard! He captured the heart of the most beautiful girl within the Yun Hai Sect!\u201dEverybody was staring at Lin Feng and were filled with envy and jealousy.Han Man, who was still injured, was looking at Lin Feng with eyes revealing an immense amount of respect. He looked like he truly worshiped and adored Lin Feng. He knew that Lin Feng not only had a strong body but his heart was the strongest that he had ever seen.Core disciples had never been able to conquer Liu Fei\u2019s heart and then suddenly Liu Fei admitted to being the girlfriend of his sworn brother!!! What great news!Lin Feng had no idea what was going on and had been confused by this whole situation. When had this all happened? When had they become a couple?Lin Feng then looked at the crowd who was surrounding them. They were looking at him with evil eyes. Damn it, that girl\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026once again she had caused him trouble.\u201cWell, I will just have to kill him.\u201d said Wen Ren Yan who looked even more furious than before.\u201cDo you dare?!\u201d shouted Liu Fei furiously.\u201cIn the Yun Hai Sect, there is nothing that I, Wen Ren Yan, don\u2019t dare.\u201dWen Ren Yan then laughed an evil laugh as if he cared for nothing in the world.\u201cIs that so? We will see about that.\u201d said a firm and steady voice.A silhouette which had appeared in the distance suddenly shot towards the cave of the elite disciples.\u201cHow presumptuous. Wen Ren Yan, do you think that you\u2019re the patriarch of the sect?\u201d said a voice which was coldly laughing. The man who had just arrived was looking at Wen Ren Yan with a look filled with disdain and anger.\u201cYue Xue, this none of your business and doesn\u2019t require you to get involved.\u201dWen Ren Yan was also looking at the man with disdain in his eyes.\u201cWen Ren Yan is really presumptuous and audacious! How dare he disrespect an elder?\u201dSome disciple who were watching the scene were shocked. Xue Yue was an Elder of the ordinary disciples. There were not many within the elite disciples who dared to disrespect him.\u201cPfff, Lin Feng and his friends came to receive their Elite Disciple Certificate and their new disciple robes and you suddenly threaten to kill him. What would other people think of our Yun Hai Sect? I am an elder, how could I not care?\u201d\u201cIndeed, this territory is under my control so you have nothing to do here.\u201dAn ice cold voice was heard inside the cave and then a middle aged man wearing an indigo chang pao suddenly appeared from the shadows.\u201cElder Lu.\u201d said Wen Ren Yan to the man wearing the indigo chang pao. He was also an Elder. He was responsible for giving the Elite Disciple certificates as well as the Elite Disciple robes to the new disciples. He was also in charge of the rankings within the disciples.Lu Yuan nodded at Wen Ren Yan in a friendly way but he wasn\u2019t as friendly to Xue Yue.\u201cXue Yue, you should stay where you belong. What are you doing here causing trouble ?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Xue Yue while staring at Lu Yuan.\u201cWhat do I mean? This is my territory. We don\u2019t need you to concern yourself with our affairs.\u201d\u201cYou mean that within your territory, Wen Ren Yan can kill other disciples as he wishes, including other elite disciples?\u201d\u201cEven if he killed a few weak ones, who would even care? Here the weak do not deserve to live and only the strong can survive. Xue Yue, you\u2019re causing too much trouble by being here.\u201dEverybody was surprised. They wouldn\u2019t have thought that the issue between Lin Feng and Wen Ren Yan would lead to an argument between two elders of the sect. However, elder Lu\u2019s words were harsh and cruel.According to elder Lu, Lin Feng was inferior to Wen Ren Yan so even if he got killed by him, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem at all. He was even saying that Lin Feng did not deserve to live. How laughable.Lin Feng also understood what Elder Lu meant. The though had made him smile but his heart grew colder than ice.He had become an elite disciple and had to come pick up his certificate and his robes but the one who was in charge of giving him these things ended up saying he wasn\u2019t strong enough and deserved to die for being inferior to Wen Ren Yan. What was that supposed to mean?Regarding Xue Yue, the first time Lin Feng had seen him was when Protector Bei had passed the responsibility of protecting the Xing Chen pavilion onto him. He was clearly one of Protector Bei\u2019s trusted friends.\u201cElder Xue.\u201d said Lin Feng suddenly. Xue Yue turned around and looked at Lin Feng.\u201cThank you.\u201d said Lin Feng while smiling.Lin Feng then looked at Wen Ren Yan and Lu Yuan and said: \u201cElder Lu, Lin Feng came to pick up his certificate and new disciple robes.\u201dLu Yuan glanced at Lin Feng with a look of disdain. He then looked at Wen Ren Yan. Not only was Wen Ren Yan very strong but his background was also terrifying.Because he appreciated Wen Ren Yan, he also decided that he was Lin Feng\u2019s enemy.\u201cElder Lu, Lin Feng came to pick up his certificate and new disciple robes.\u201dLin Feng said it even louder than before sounding extremely strict and firm.\u201cYou really don\u2019t know who you are talking to.\u201d said Lu Yuan while glancing at Lin Feng and then shouted: \u201cGet Lost!\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Lu Yuan, you\u2019re really being unfair. Lin Feng is now an elite disciple of our Yun Hai Sect, you must give him his robes and his certificate. This is a rule within the sect. Would you be daring enough to break the sect rules so blatantly?\u201d said Xue Yue in an ice cold tone.\u201cElder Xue.\u201d Lin Feng said in a soft voice. Xue Yue turned around and looked at Lin Feng.\u201cToday, I have come to pick up my certificate and robes as an elite disciple but Elder Lu doesn\u2019t want to let me. He insulted me and told me to get lost. Elder Xue had witnessed all these things as they happened, right?\u201d asked Lin Feng.\u201cIndeed.\u201d said Xue Yue nodding. He didn\u2019t understand Lin Feng\u2019s point.\u201cSince I now have a witness that I am being treated unfairly, I have had enough.\u201d said Lin Feng while smiling coldly. \u201cIf they refuse me entry into the elite disciples, it means that the sect has chosen to abandon me.\u201dWhen he finished talking, Lin Feng quickly turned around and went towards Han Man. The whole crowd was stupefied and didn\u2019t understand what Lin Feng meant.\u201cPfff, don\u2019t think that you can run away because Xue Yue is here to defend you. Next time that I see you, I will kill you.\u201d Wen Ren Yan knew that he couldn\u2019t kill Lin Feng in front of Xue Yue but next time they\u2019d meet alone, he\u2019d definitely kill Lin Feng.\u201cI\u2019ll wait for you to try.\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s words were clear even though the distance between them had grown. He had already started walking away and his silhouette was gradually disappearing.Xue Yue frowned. He looked at Lu Yuan with an ice cold glare and said furiously: \u201cLu Yuan, I cannot believe your ignorance today! You will truly regret your actions today, you will do nothing but regret these actions.\u201dWhen he finished talking, Xue Yue brushed the dust from his sleeve and left. How ridiculous was Lu Yuan acting? Did he really think that supporting Wen Ren Yan was the right thing to do? That it would be useful to him in the future? Did he not understand how greatly the protectors and the patriarch valued Lin Feng? If he had truly known the situation then he would not have had the same attitude when dealing with Lin Feng.\u201cI never regret anything that I do.\u201d said Lu Yuan showing everyone that he was not scared of any repercussions and then said to Wen Ren Yan: \u201cwhat a pity that we had to let him go.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he will die sooner or later.\u201d said Wen Ren Yan. His words were like those a venomous snake. He was gazing with a venomous stare into the distance where Lin Feng had left. When Lin Feng left, Liu Fei had surprisingly followed him. Saying that Liu Fei was his girlfriend and his possession had caused him to be humiliated after everything that Lin Feng and Liu Fei had said.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cLin Feng\u2026\u201dLiu Fei quickly caught up with Lin Feng and shouted out to him.\u201cHaha, I just remembered that I had things to do and that I had to leave with Po Jun.\u201dWhen Han Man saw that Liu Fei was coming towards them, a huge smile appeared on his face then he quickly pulled Po Jun and ran ahead to give the couple some privacy. Judging from his actions, you would hardly believe he had been injured only moments ago.Lin Feng\u2019s eyes rolled. That sneaky guy\u2026\u2026. how could he suddenly have become so crafty?\u201cLin Feng, please be careful next time. If you see Wen Ren Yan, please avoid a conflict with him. Stay away from him at all costs. That guy is very dangerous.\u201d Liu Fei warned Lin Feng.She knew that Wen Ren Yan would try to kill Lin Feng if he had the opportunity in the future.\u201cI thought that you hated me. How come you suddenly care about me now?\u201d said Lin Feng while laughing as if he had ignored Liu Fei\u2019s warning.Liu Fei was speechless. That guy was surprisingly in the mood to make jokes. She knew how terrifying Wen Ren Yan was and the status that he held.\u201cI just don\u2019t want you to die because you have to go to the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue, that\u2019s all.\u201d said Liu Fei while staring at Lin Feng.\u201cIs that so? But I have never said that I was going to the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue.\u201d Lin Feng continued: \u201cNow that I think about it, I do remember that you said something about you being my girlfriend?\u201d\u201cI just said it because of the situation.\u201d said Fei resolutely while staring at Lin Feng without blinking. That guy had dared to bring up an embarrassing situation again. She just wanted to show to everyone that Wen Ren Yan was a liar. She wanted him to stop creating lies about her and humiliate him at the same time.\u201cCan you really just say such things just because of the situation? asked Lin Feng whose eyes were rolling. His hands started moving towards Liu Fei.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dLiu Fei felt a chill down her spine and vigilantly looked at Lin Feng.That guy\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201cYou\u2019re my girlfriend now. I should start behaving like a proper boyfriend would with his girlfriend. As your boyfriend I have certain duties to fulfill.\u201d Said Lin Feng as he was moving towards Liu Fei in a peculiar motion.\u201cYou bastard! Dream on!\u201dLiu Fei\u2019s face was flushed completely red. She was furious and embarrassed. She immediately stormed off.That bastard\u2026\u2026 what did he mean by \u201ca boyfriend has duties to fulfill\u201d? \u2026and he then dares say he\u2019s not a pervert.Lin Feng observed Liu Fei as she walked away. Her body was incredibly graceful with each movement. He had a tender smile on his face. His impression that Liu Fei was a bad person was disappearing with each day. He now had a very good impression of her and had started to grow fond of her. She was actually very cute. There was no one who could deny that she was incredibly beautiful and grew more attractive with each day.\u201cHow come I never noticed this before?\u201d Lin Feng thought with a smile on his face.When he had first arrived in this world, he thought it was a very cold and ruthless world. His determination, willpower and strength were the only things he could rely on.Now he was beginning to feel familiar in this world and he was gradually becoming more relaxed. Sometimes, he was a bit unconventional or a bit insolent\u2026 but he had to make others respect him through force or he would be bullied for the rest of his life. He has chosen to never serve beneath anyone and be bullied again.Lin Feng\u2019s determination and willpower was truly incredible for a cultivator. He was proud of his sword skills and there was a determination to improve his sword skills while growing stronger. He wanted to grow stronger.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026A pleasant and warm light was illuminating the ground.On that day, the Yun Hai Sect looked absolutely desolate. There was almost nobody that could be seen.But in a distant place it wasn\u2019t desolate at all: within the Stormy Gorge.The Stormy Gorge was filled with all members of the Yun Hai Sect. Again they looked like a colony of ants, they were all being pushed shoulder to shoulder.The Elite Elders and the Ordinary Elders were not sitting inside the gorge, they were now upon a high seating area which could see the Life and Death Arena from above.This seating area was grand and imposing to all those who looked upon it. It was entirely made out of stone. The view made Lin Feng sigh in admiration. He remembered the stadiums in his previous life and thought that the seating area in the Stormy Gorge was even more fantastic. The Yun Hai Sect usually didn\u2019t use this seating area often, but this time they wanted to show everyone how important the Elite Disciple Exam was.It was the beginning of the second round of the Elite Disciple Exam. The ordinary disciple ranking list had a hundred names, the elite disciple list had eighty one and the core disciple list only had thirty six names.But it was clear to everyone that the ordinary disciple ranking list would lose a great deal of power when the strongest ordinary disciples joined the elite disciples. Indeed, the ordinary disciple ranking list would lose the strongest disciples. This is why people particularly enjoyed watching the elite disciple and core disciple ranking.By looking at the ranking lists, it was possible to understand how powerful each of the disciples were. By understanding how powerful the disciples were, it was possible to know how strong the sect currently was. After all, the disciples were the future of the sect.Nan Gong Ling had suddenly stood up. Everyone had quickly become completely silent.Nan Gong Ling slightly smiled and then started talking. But at that moment, he looked surprised and frowned.He was staring into the distance at a storm of violent clouds on the horizon. There was a strangely violent air approaching. The sea of violent clouds rushed across the sky like a wave crashing into the ocean.\u201cNan Gong Ling, that is Chu Qing from the Hao Yue Sect. He is carrying a group of people with him.\u201dThe clouds were crashing through the sky and making terrifying booms. The air was shaking with the pressure. The sound of crashing was so loud that it entered the ears of the disciples and seemed to pierce through into their souls.\u201cHow terrifyingly powerful!\u201dEverybody was staring in amazement looking at the group of people who were approaching. They looked like there were surfing on the violent clouds.At the same time, the sky was growing cloudy and snowflakes seemed to be falling from the clear sky above.\u201cHan Xue Tian of Ice and Snow Village Mountain has come to pay a visit.\u201dThere was a powerful voice which was echoing through the snow. The voice was accompanied by a sudden strong snowfall. Everyone started feeling cold.Han Xue Tian was the Patriarch of the Ice and Snow Mountain Village.\u201cDuan Wu Tian and Teng Wu Shan have also come to pay a visit.\u201dMore voices were heard within the snow. A storm of raging clouds was heading towards them on the horizon and snow was filling the atmosphere around them. Everybody was shaking from the cold and also the fear of the power which was being displayed .The scariest was that that cold air was filled with a terrifying sword Qi. It was extremely sharp and seemed like it was ready to pierce through flesh at any moment. However the source could not be seen.In the distance there was a black shadow moving through the sky, it was a colossal monster which was completely black from head to toe. With each flap of its wings it created a vacuum in the air.That colossal pitch black monster had a length of a few dozen meters and about 4 meters thick. The people who were riding it were wearing chang paos which blew elegantly in the wind.That wild beast was a Python Fish which could fly through the sky and swim to the deepest ocean. Its scales were pitch black and it had gigantic wings on its back. It was a very strange creature and mysterious creature.\u201cWhat a horrible looking monster!\u201dEverybody was stupefied staring blankly at that Python Fish. It was swallowing clouds and blowing out a dark fog with each breath.What terrified the crowd even more was that around his huge wings was the same incredible amount of sword Qi. No one knew where this terrifying sword Qi was coming from.Suddenly everyone could see a gigantic sword flying in the air, there was a silhouette standing atop the sword with an arrogant smile.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 - BrutalityPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNan Gong Ling\u2019s expression was gradually becoming ice cold. The expression in his eyes was as sharp as a sword as he looked at the crowd in front of him.Chu Qing was the Patriarch of the Hao Yue Sect. He was Chu Zhan Peng\u2019s father.Han Xue Tian was the Patriarch of the Ice and Snow Mountain Village.Teng Wu Shan was the Vice-Patriarch of the Mo Shou Sect.Duan Tian Lang was the prince of the Imperial Family and was also Duan Han\u2019s father who had come to the Yun Hai Sect recently and been thrown out.All these people belonged to some of the most powerful Sects and Clans. They had come during the Elite Disciple Exam and it did not feel like they had come with good intentions.\u201cPatriarch Nan Gong Ling, all of these people coming to visit on the same day, this is a bit strange.\u201dDuan Tian Lang was the person standing on the gigantic sword. He was wearing a magnificent plate of armor which made him look like a majestic ruler. The gigantic sword began to lose altitude and moved towards the viewing platform accompanied by the sound of the atmosphere tearing under its pressure.At the same time, Chu Qing and Han Xue Tian were also slowly moving down to the platform while looking extremely condescending.Next to Duan Tian Lang, Duan Han was staring at Nan Gong Ling looking indifferent. Nan Gong Ling had recently humiliated him and told him to leave the Yun Hai Sect. Now he held a grudge against Nan Gong Ling and wanted to teach him a lesson.\u201cOh hehe, it is an honor for me to receive Duan Tian Lang within the Yun Hai Sect. Please feel at home.\u201d said Nan Gong Ling with a cold smile across his face and he then added: \u201cIt is only that we didn\u2019t expect you to bring so many people. What brings you all to my Yun Hai Sect?\u201d\u201cNot so long ago, that boy, Duan Han already visited you. The purpose of his visit was also very clear to you. His Majesty sees the things that we cannot. Therefore, he is preparing to finish building the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue. Thus, he requires some of the most outstanding disciples within the country. All of the sects have already replied and chosen some of their disciples except for the Yun Hai Sect\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen he finished talking Duan Tian Lang smiled and didn\u2019t add anything else.\u201cHuh?\u201d Nan Gong Ling was making a strange face. Chu Qing, Han Xue Tian and all these people were extremely powerful. Their children were also extremely talented. If they sent disciples there then they would be under the control of the Imperial Clan and as a consequence, would not belong to the Yun Hai Sect in the future.But Chu Qing noticed that Duan Tian Lang had been talking in a very calm and soft tone which was why, Nan Gong Ling hadn\u2019t understood what he meant.\u201cAlright, what does Duan Tian Lang propose to do?\u201d asked Nan Gong Ling.\u201cSince Nan Gong Ling hasn\u2019t been willing to hand over some of his best disciples, I personally came on behalf of His Majesty to select some myself. Today is the day of the Elite Disciple Exam within the Yun Hai Sect. I\u2019ll be able to see your strongest disciples with my own eyes and select them one after the other.\u201d said Duan Tian Lang in a strict manner.The facial expression of every member of the Yun Hai Sect suddenly changed. How savage! What kind of place did they think the Yun Hai Sect was? What gave them the right to choose geniuses as they pleased?\u201cWhat happens if I don\u2019t agree?\u201d said Nan Gong Ling as his voice grew colder.\u201cNan Gong Ling will agree just like all the other Patriarchs had to agree.\u201d said Duan Tian Lang as he was filled with confidence. He was talking as if his word was law and no one could refute him.\u201cNan Gong Ling isn\u2019t hurrying to select disciples because of the Elite Disciple Exam but he shouldn\u2019t disagree too fast either. The Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue will not accept mediocre disciples. It will only accept the best and most outstanding disciples of the entire Xue Yue Country. They will give them access to the best profound pills, the best weapons and the best teachers available. Resources will be almost endless.There will also be the possibility to learn the most powerful skills available. They will be able to choose between an enormous amount of martial skills and they will truly become the pillars of the country.\u201dDuan Tian Lang was saying those words to all the disciples of the Yun Hai Sect. He was trying to tempt them with the vast wealth. Gaining access to an unlimited quantity of weapons, pills and skills\u2026 all disciples of the Yun Hai Sect would obviously tempted, who would refuse such a wonderful opportunity?They came to the Yun Hai Sect for the sake of Cultivation. They wanted to become powerful. If the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue could provide them with a better cultivation environment as well as much better cultivation facilities, what reasons did they have to stay in the Yun Hai Sect?At that moment, many disciples became restless. Many disciples were prepared to give their utmost to be accepted into the Holy Courtyard.\u201cHow despicable.\u201dNan Gong Ling cursed. Duan Tian Lang who was trying to cause a rift within the Yun Hai Sect. It was truly a cunning and ruthless plan.What Nan Gong Ling found even more intolerable is that they were clearly provoking the Yun Hai Sect with these actions.\u201cI\u2019m curious to see who would dare to oppose the Yun Hai Sect.\u201d thought Nan Gong Ling. He then looked at Duan Tian Lang and said: \u201cSince Duan Tian Lang wants to watch the Elite Disciple Exam, I will allow you to stay and watch.\u201d\u201cThe ranked battles for the ordinary disciple and the core disciples are postponed for another day. Today, only elite disciples can fight.\u201dThe crowd burst into an uproar when they heard Nan Gong but a short instant after, they understood why he had made that decision.The ordinary disciples were too weak so the Yun Hai Sect would lose face. The core disciples were the heart of the Yun Hai Sect and he could not afford to lose these disciples. There wouldn\u2019t be much time before a core disciple could become a new pillar within the Sect. In addition, it wouldn\u2019t be wise to show the strength of the core disciples to the unwelcome guests. Therefore, showing the elite disciples was the most suitable decision.Duan Tian Lang was smiling. Would Nan Gong Ling\u2019s actions make any difference?\u201cElite disciples, go into the Life and Death Arena and make a line in the order as indicated by the ranking list.\u201d Said Nan Gong Ling.The elite disciples, whose name was in the list of the ranking list composed of eighty one disciples. The entire crowd was staring at them with admiration. They would have the chance to bring honor to themselves and the sect.\u201cI will also change the rules of the second round of the Elite Disciple Exam. If you want to be in the ranking list, you must challenge someone who is already on the ranking list. If you win, you will be ranked. No disciple can be challenged twice.\u201dNan Gong Ling continued to talk. The crowd burst into an uproar again. A multitude of people was disappointed and had given up all hope. This round was a chance for disciples to test themselves and their own strength. However because of the new rule the exam had changed. Many disciples would no longer have the chance to test themselves against the elite disciples.\u201cThese battles will all be fought to the death. There are\u2026\u2026 no restrictions.\u201d\u201cBoooom.\u201d That shocking sentence was like a bomb exploding in everyone\u2019s head. No restrictions\u2026.to the death\u2026If they challenged the stronger of the elite disciples then they could lose the battle and their life along with it. There was no option to give up, they would be slaughtered.A victory meant being able to see one\u2019s name in the elite disciple ranking list. Losing had serious consequences to the extent that an opponent without mercy could end your life. That was a big price to pay for losing.\u201cDangerous.\u201d\u201cGambling with one\u2019s life at stake is too dangerous. I\u2019ll just try again next year.\u201dA countless number of disciples were shaking their heads after the previous statement. Many of them agreed on the fact that risking one\u2019s life in order to join the ranking list was not a worthwhile risk.\u201cLin Feng, the Patriarch is really cruel. I just joined the elite disciples but I am also only at the first Ling Qi layer. On that list composed of eighty one names, the weakest have already broken through to the second Ling Qi layer. I have no chance for winning at all.\u201dHan Man was smiling wryly. He thought he was going to get the chance to fight as much as he could during the Elite Disciple Exam but hadn\u2019t expected that things would turn out this way.Lin Feng had a different feeling. These new rules would probably lead to incredible battles. Not only were those who were going to join brave, but they would also be the most outstanding members of the sect. Only those outstanding disciples would risk their life. That is what Nan Gong Ling wanted to see. He wanted to show these people how strong his disciples were.\u201cAll the eighty one disciples on the ranking list are now on the fighting stage in the Life and Death Arena. Now you can challenge any of them and go onto the fighting stage of the middle.\u201dWhen Nan Gong Ling finished talking, he sat down and observed Duan Tian Lang.\u201cLuo Lie is willing to challenge You Lin to a battle.\u201dA silhouette stepped onto the fighting stage. Because it was impossible to challenge the same person twice, the first person had a huge advantage over the other disciples as he could challenge someone who was very low in the rankings. You Lin was the eighty first ranked disciple.At that moment, You Lin had an ugly facial expression. Being the first one to be challenged\u2026 that was such a humiliation.\u201cWhoever chooses to challenge us ranked disciples, death will be your punishment.\u201dSaid Ren Wen Yan who was standing in front of everyone else on the fighting stage. He had made it clear to all disciples with his cold tone that the ranked disciples would kill all their challengers.\u201cAgreed.\u201d Said You Ling as he jumped onto the fighting stage. He immediately started to unleash all of his skills using his full power. Even if Wen Ren Yan hadn\u2019t said, You Lin had already planned to kill his opponent.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The Stormy Gorge became particularly calm.The crowd was watching the fighting stage within the Life and Death Arena. The fighting stage was entirely red with blood. Lying on the fighting stage was a pile of corpses. All of these corpses were the corpses of the challengers. They had all lost and been killed without exception. They did not remove the corpses but left them there as a reminder to anyone who issued a challenge. This would be the place where they entered their eternal rest.Losing your challenge would mean certain death.The lesson was cruel and bloody. Gradually, those who were eager to challenge these ranked disciples were slowly dwindling.The disciples who had been challenged were the ones at the bottom of the ranking. From that moment, if someone else wanted to challenge these ranked elite disciples, they had to challenge those who were even higher in the ranking list.As expected from the ranked elite disciples, none of them was mediocre. Even You Lin who was ranked eighty one was exceptionally strong.Nan Gong Ling was still sitting indifferently looking at the fighting stage. That bloody lesson was going to show these young disciples how hard, cruel and brutal the path of cultivation was.On the path of cultivation, only those who had a persistent heart, as well as a determination and willpower as solid as rock, could march forward courageously. Those who had a fear of blood would not last long on the path of cultivation. Those who were too kindhearted would be killed for their foolishness. This was not a world to be underestimated with light heartened ideals.\u201cA bunch of crappy cultivators trying in vain to be ranked is enough to make you all so desperate and hopeless?\u201dWen Ren Yan said while pointing at the five corpses on the stage. He then glanced evilly at the entire crowd looking extremely. He was mocking every elite disciple who was not within the ranking.He was the top ranked elite disciple and none of these five people were worth his time.All the elite disciples were furious but at the same time they felt powerless. They couldn\u2019t believe Wen Ren Yan\u2019s harsh words but he was a genius whose power was acknowledged by everybody. There were very few people who would dare to provoke him.\u201cPatriarch, I think that you can establish the new ranking list now. They are all pathetic and hopeless.\u201dWen Ren Yan was looking at Nan Gong Ling as he hurled insults at the other elite disciples to make himself look better.Nan Gong Ling looked around at the crowd and slightly nodded. Wen Ren Yan was really highly arrogant but he was right, the Yun Hai Sect didn\u2019t have that many geniuses. Inevitably, he would sooner or later become one of the pillars of the sect.\u201cRidiculous, you truly are laughable.\u201dA loud voice was heard spreading through the atmosphere. It made the crowd shiver.Wen Ren Yan was surprised. He looked around to see who had said these words to him.\u201cYou again.\u201d Said Wen Ren Yan with murderous intentions in his eyes. \u201cWhat is so ridiculous?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the top ranked elite disciple. Yet you are still extremely presumptuous. You look down on other disciples while calling them names, calling them crap\u2026 but at the beginning when you started practicing cultivation, were you as strong as now? Were you born as an unrivalled master of the Lin Qi Layer? Have you ever considered that to others, you might be the crappy cultivator?\u201dLin Feng had a cold smile on the corner of his mouth as he continued to hurl insults. Wen Ren Yan was extremely arrogant. Lin Feng had said these words to make him aware that the world is bigger than what he knows. Wen Ren Yan was like the frog stuck in the well, he did not know how vast the sky was.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 - The Yun Hai Sect is Polluted!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCrappy Cultivator? Suddenly, someone dared insult Wen Ren Yan and call him a crappy cultivator?The entire crowd was staring deeply at Lin Feng. They were stupefied because Lin Feng was still wearing the clothes of an ordinary disciple. Could it be that he was still an ordinary disciple?Nan Gong Ling was also surprised. He had taken great pleasure in openly announcing to the sect that Lin Feng had become an elite disciple. Why was he still wearing the clothes of an ordinary disciple?Within the Yun Hai Sect Nan Gong Ling had a lot of admiration for four disciples: Ling Hu He Shan, Tu Fu, Wen Ren Yan and Lin Feng.At that moment, Ling Hu He Shan was constantly impressing him with his actions. Fu Tu was becoming stronger and stronger with each passing day. Wen Ren Yan seemed to have an infinite potential. Regarding Lin Feng, he was still a bit weak but he had made a display of his abilities and his future was certainly going to be brilliant.These disciples also regarded Nan Gong Ling as a good Patriarch. Therefore, Nan Gong Ling hoped that there were no tensions between them. The tensions existing between Lin Feng and Wen Ren Yan would probably not be to his liking.\u201cWhat gives you the right to talk to me like this? In front of me you will always be a crappy cultivator and like before a piece of trash.\u201dWen Ren Yan azure blue eyes were evilly staring at Lin Feng.\u201cYou\u2019re really narrow minded. You\u2019re that kind of person who doesn\u2019t know who is good or bad, who has abilities and who doesn\u2019t, especially who to call names and those you should never dare to call names.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s words were getting more and more profound as well as harsher which somewhat amused the entire crowd. They found him fascinating. He could not see the difference between heaven and earth. Wen Ren Yan was respected by everyone and he surprisingly dared disrespect him. He was truly reckless and immature.\u201cAre you trying to say that you are more qualified than me?\u201d asked Wen Ren Yan as if he had just heard the funniest joke of his life.\u201cI may not be more qualified than you but I don\u2019t go around randomly insulting people and calling them \u2018piece of trash\u2019. I am careful of who I offend.\u201d said Lin Feng slowly walking towards the Life and Death Arena, towards the central fighting stage. He looked extremely calm and serene.\u201cYou\u2019re the top ranked elite disciple and you despise the other elite disciples. You say that they are hopeless. If there was a core disciple here to call you trash, would you dare still act so arrogantly?\u201d\u201cPffff, core disciples are obviously stronger than me but I will surpass them eventually so they don\u2019t have the qualification to call me trash. People like you will never be able to surpass me or even catch up to me.\u201dWen Ren Yan was endlessly arrogant. The Yun Hai Sect disciples felt so furious that their cheeks were burning in anger. They were not strong enough to rebuke him as much as they had wanted to. Wen Ren Yan was an incomparable genius within the sect.\u201cRidiculous.\u201d Lin Feng had already arrived on the edge of the fighting stage of the Life and Death Arena. He then climbed up onto the stage.\u201cIn the eyes of many people, you are indeed a once in a lifetime genius. However in my eyes, you are a fool and nothing more. I don\u2019t understand why the Yun Hai Sect respects you and even attaches even the slightest of importance to you.\u201dWhen Lin Feng finished talking, everybody was stupefied. Not only was he humiliating Wen Ren Yan but he was calling into question the actions of the sect. How audacious!\u201cYou really want to die!\u201dWen Ren Yan had a demonic expression in his eyes and he slowly started walking to the fighting stage. Very slowly, one step after the other. He looked like a demon ready to unleash his fury.\u201cNobody slacks when it comes to the Elite Disciple Exam. They all want to become ranked for the glory that comes with it. Those who are not ranked rely on the weaker disciples to become ranked. Those who are ranked rely on those at the top of the list to protect order. This is the way that things worked. This is the way of the world. Even if they lose while attempting to rise to new heights, it is not a humiliation. There\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of, but Wen Ren Yan you are evil. You don\u2019t even respect those who died today. You\u2026 are truly heartless.\u201d\u201cBeing the top ranked elite disciple and insulting the other elite disciples\u2026 calling them worthless even after their death. That is a cruel humiliation for our fellow disciples who died attempting to rise to glory. That\u2019s unfair.\u201d\u201cHeartless, cruel and unfair\u2026 The Yun Hai Sect, including all of our fellow disciples has helped you become what you are now. If the Yun Hai Sect ever has a big problem then will it be able to trust you considering that you don\u2019t care about killing your fellow disciples or seeing them murdered? The most important thing is that even if you are extremely strong, will the Yun Hai Sect even be able to benefit from it?\u201dWhile Lin Feng was saying these profound words, the atmosphere had gone completely silent and still. A cruel, heartless and unfair yet extremely strong disciple, did the Yun Hai Sect need him?\u201cBOOOM!\u201dA violent and ice cold Qi emerged like waves on the fighting stage. The temperature rapidly began to drop.\u201cSo ashamed that you cannot control yourself? Too bad, I\u2019m not done talking yet.\u201dLin Feng wasn\u2019t frightened at all and was smiling coldly. Lin Feng moved forward to the center of the fighting stage and looked at Wen Ren Yan with disdain.\u201cThe Continent of the Nine Clouds is so incredibly vast. Wen Ren Yan, what other places have you even ever been to? How many real geniuses have you met in your life? And you dared to talk like you were unrivalled under the heavens. You dare to be extremely arrogant and humiliate other people while being so insignificant. A Cultivator of the third Ling Qi layer is considered as relatively weak compared to the rest of the world. In the Xue Yue Country, there are cities filled with stronger cultivators than you with talent that you could only dream of. I don\u2019t understand how you are more qualified than anyone else, I do not understand what gives you the right to act in such a way.\u201d\u201cWen Ren Yan you are like a mouse which can only see an inch, a frog at the bottom of a well\u2026 that\u2019s all. You really know nothing about the world. You know not how vast the sky is or how deep the ocean is. You know nothing.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s words astonished everyone. Even Nan Gong Ling and Duan Tian Lang were moved by Lin Feng\u2019s words. Everything Lin Feng said was profound and showed how wise he truly was.Wen Ren Yan was shaking from head to toe with fury. Lin Feng\u2019s words were piercing to the extent that even his soul was shaking in anger. He could see that everyone was staring at him with looks of disdain.It seemed like Lin Feng was determined to punish him using his words.He was gazing into the distance. Lin Feng had not said a single lie and had revealed the truth of his nature.\u201cAn unfair and cruel young disciple like this\u2026 adored and respected by other disciples\u2026 respected by the elders\u2026 a source of inspiration for ordinary disciples\u2026 Could it be that the Yun Hai Sect was only worth this much?\u201dWas the Yun Hai Sect only worth this much?Everybody in the crowd felt awkward. Lin Feng said that Wen Ren Yan was arrogant. What about him? Saying that the Yun Hai Sect was only worth so much, wasn\u2019t saying this very arrogant of him?\u201d\u201cWhat an audacious ordinary disciple. Daring to humiliate the entire Yun Hai sect. You really want to die!\u201d said an Elder while looking at the fighting stage. That was precisely the elder, who had humiliated Lin Feng refusing to give him his elite disciples robes and certificate: Lu Yuan.\u201cThere are many people like you in the Yun Hai Sect. It is becoming more and more polluted each day with your stupidity.\u201dSaid Lin Feng who wasn\u2019t scared and just smiled coldly. He then said to Lu Yuan: \u201cSo, you think that ordinary disciples are not worthy and that elite disciples are above others because they are strong?\u201d\u201cYou five, you consider yourselves to be strong and powerful. Yet you dare to ruthlessly murder your fellow disciples. How powerful you must be to murder an already defeated opponent! Have you ever thought of the fact that there are people who are much stronger than you and they might treat you in the same way? Have any of you stopped to consider that before you murdered a fellow disciple for wanting to become stronger?\u201dLin Feng was staring at the five ranked elite disciples who had just killed their challengers. \u201cEven though the Yun Hai Sect has rules, they are still useless as they are not enforced. All that is enforced is to destroy fellow disciples and humiliate them. I challenge you five murderers, I think that nobody will have any problems with this. Shall we listen to what the Patriarch has to say.\u201dLin Feng stopped talking. At that moment, everybody was stupefied. Lin Feng wanted to challenge five ranked elite disciples.Madman!Lin Feng was obviously insane!Even though Lin Feng understood how to use sword force, these five Cultivators were of the second Ling Qi layer. They could kill him with a single strike.But Lin Feng surprisingly dared to challenge five ranked elite disciples at once. How insane was he?Han Man\u2019s mouth was wide open. He was speechless. That guy\u2026.At that moment in the crowd, Liu Fei was also shocked. Her beautiful eyes were staring at Lin Feng looking worried. She thought that even though Lin Feng was powerful, he was still much weaker than the geniuses standing before him. That\u2019s why she wanted Lin Feng to take his time and practice. With time he could become an incredibly powerful person. His name would definitely appear on the ranking list in the future, however if he fought right now he may lose his life.But was Lin Feng going to achieve a miracle? That bastard, how could he challenge five ranked elite disciples at the same time? Could it be that he didn\u2019t know the difference between their strengths.\u201cBastard.\u201d Liu Fei was cursing secretly in her heart. She was incredibly worried about Lin Feng\u2019s safety. There was no chance of them letting Lin Feng leave the arena alive.As far as Nan Gong Ling was concerned, he was very surprised. Suddenly challenging five ranked elite disciples? Did he not even understand that this might not go the way he planned?He had personally declared Lin Feng as an elite disciple, how come he was still wearing his ordinary disciple robes?\u201cFive is too many. Start with one first.\u201dNan Gong Ling didn\u2019t want Lin Feng to take such great risks. He was also worried about two of the disciples that he respected the most. The tensions existing between the two of them was not to his liking.\u201cNo need. The five of you, hurry and climb up onto the stage.\u201dLin Feng sounded like he was an immature brat who knew nothing of the world. He was talking down to his opponents as if they were nothing.\u201cYou want to die, I will show you.\u201dOne of the five was laughing. Lin Feng was already dead in his mind. He had dared challenge the five of them at once.\u201cQuickly get up there. I am sick of looking at his smug face.\u201dWen Ren Yan interrupted him. He kept thinking about what Lin Feng had said, that he was cruel, heartless, arrogant. That he would be of no use to the sect\u2026 He had a deep and bitter hatred for Lin Feng.The five disciples hurried up because of what Wen Ren Yan had just said.The five silhouettes climbed up onto the fighting stage. Suddenly, a strong Qi pressed down onto Lin Feng.\u201cRemember the name of the one who is going to kill you: Yue Yang.\u201dAn enormous flame suddenly appeared illuminating the entire arena. It was growing much bigger and hotter as if it was being fueled by everything around it, to endlessly burn everything.Another Gigantic flame emerged out of his head and rose into the atmosphere. The other four disciples all started using their own skills, each more powerful than the last. This was the combined strength of five disciples of the second Ling Qi layer. Even if they didn\u2019t release their spirit, their combined strength was absolutely enormous. Even people who were not on the fighting stage could sense it.It looked like Lin Feng was going to be killed by the pressure enveloping his body before they even had a chance to attack.\u201cBOOM!\u201d\u201cBOOM!\u201d\u201cBOOM!\u201d\u201cBOOM!\u201d\u201cBOOM!\u201d\u201cBOOM!\u201d\u201cBOOM!\u201d\u201cBOOM!\u201dEight extremely powerful strikes covered the sky and crashed down onto the atmosphere shattering it instantly. Each strike rushing forward looked like a stampede of armored horsemen.\u201cThe Eight Strikes of Desolation mastered to perfection.\u201dThe crowd was amazed by the attack and its boundless strength and power. The sound of the five disciples\u2019 attacks colliding with Lin Feng\u2019s attack filled the atmosphere.\u201cDie.\u201d Yue Yang threw himself towards Lin Feng. Flames were unceasingly coming out of his body even stronger and hotter than before. When he had seen Lin Feng using the Eight Strikes of Desolation, he was surprised as he hadn\u2019t thought that Lin Feng was so strong. But he thought that a perfectly mastered Eight Strikes of Desolation, when facing the combined power of five ranked elite disciples, it was still far from being enough to compete with them.\u201cDie.\u201dThe whistling sound of the sword spread throughout the atmosphere. The atmosphere was glowing with the power of sword force. It looked resplendent.It was so quick that it all that could be seen was a trace of light between them. Before the light slowly faded to the sound of Lin Feng sheathing his sword.Yue Yang\u2019s body was still diffusing an immense flame. He even had a flame coming from his head. Suddenly, in the blink of an eye, a small line had appeared on his neck out of which blood started to endlessly spill.Sword unsheathing.They had all almost forgotten that Lin Feng\u2019s strong point was when he was using his swords. He was better at using swords than his fists.There was an incredible amount of sword force contained within the arena and the sword was still glowing with power.Lin Feng\u2019s Eight Strikes of Desolation attack a moment ago had been very powerful but he had relied on the strength of the first Ling Qi layer and had attacked all of the five ranked Elite Disciples. Yue Yang seemed to have forgotten that Lin Feng was an expert at using swords and that he could use both hands. That was the price to pay for forgetting that. For underestimating Lin Feng the small price of a head would be collected.\u201cWas that sword unsheathing?!\u201dQuite a lot of disciples knew the attack. They were astonished though because they thought sword unsheathing was a useless skill\u2026 but in Lin Feng\u2019s hands, it was so powerful. It was fast as light. In his hands it was an incredibly destructive skill.That sword! How breathtaking! How stunning!\u201cNo wonder Protector Bei appreciates him so much. Give him any skill and he can accomplish miracles with it.\u201dLin Feng was now even higher within Nan Gong Ling\u2019s esteem. He was most likely only at the first Ling Qi layer and could already master Eight Strikes of Desolation to perfection as well as Sword Unsheathing. It was hard to believe that he had just become an elite disciple when looking at his skills.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Standing side by side, they were looking at the dead body lying on the fighting stage yet they all were still calm.Yue Yang was ranked seventy first. He was the strongest of the five disciples but Lin Feng had killed him with a single strike. If it had been any of the other four, they would have been unable to withstand that strike.Lin Feng, who was stronger than Yue Yang had the potential to kill each of them.When thinking about what had just happened, they were paying more attention while staring deeply at Lin Feng. A slight murderous chill had filled the air and as it was carried by a small breeze, on contact it would make the disciples shiver.\u201cWhen I take your life, don\u2019t forget to remember that you cruelly took the life of others before. You will equally be killed by someone stronger than you. This was the fate chosen by you. You will now have to deal with the consequences of your actions.\u201dLin Feng finished speaking and started to walk forwards.Sword energy had started to fill the atmosphere and condense on the tip of his sword.A cold sweat ran down the backs of the four elite disciples. They could feel exactly how powerful the sword force contained within the sword was. Was Lin Feng already a sword master? How could he master sword force to such a high level?A strong Qi filled the air within the arena and with each step it was growing stronger. The four disciples could feel that the terrifying sword force and Qi were growing stronger with each step made by Lin Feng. It seemed like this force was absorbing the Qi from the atmosphere.\u201cWe cannot delay this for even a second longer, my Qi is getting weaker while the sword force and the Qi contained within his sword continue to grow stronger. If we wait too long, we are doomed.\u201dThe four of them were looking at Lin Feng vigilantly and understood that the situation was getting incredibly dangerous. At the same time they had all started rushing towards Lin Feng from different directions.\u201cDie.\u201dAn incredibly violent sword force started to press down against the four other disciples. His hand slightly moved and suddenly a radiant light shot through the atmosphere.Suddenly two sprays of blood shot into the air like bloody arrows and turned into an endless stream. His sword was so deadly that with each move another life was taken.Two bodies fell heavily onto the ground making a soft thud. When rushing towards Lin Feng, the remaining two disciples had chosen to move slightly slower than the others who had just died. They had betrayed them and used them as a shield.But did they think that they were going to survive?Everybody in the crowd was shaking in fear, especially some of the elite disciples. How? How had Lin Feng become so strong? Not only was the Qi he was using of the first Ling Qi layer but he had also managed to kill ranked elite disciples with a single strike. He was fighting five elite disciples and rather than being at a disadvantage, he had already killed three of them.\u201cSword of Nirvana\u2026 It\u2019s an average skill of the Xuan level. That skill enhances the power of each sword strike and also enabled the cultivator to greatly increase his power when using sword force.\u201dMany people were looking at Lin Feng and his swordplay. It seemed like he had chosen skills which are usually ignored by other disciples. Many people thought that the Sword of Nirvana was a useless skill. However they didn\u2019t know that the Sword of Nirvana was actually an extremely powerful attack which had the potential to match that of a high Xuan level skill. However it required an advanced understanding of the world and elemental forces. It was a very hard skill to practice. This was the reason why so many people had not considered this skill.But Lin Feng could already master that skill to perfection and fully benefit from the enhanced power contained within his sword.\u201cEscape.\u201dThe remaining two thought to themselves. Escape was the only thing which remained within their minds. They couldn\u2019t fight against Lin Feng anymore. They both turned and attempted to retreat into different directions.\u201cDie.\u201dLin Feng\u2019 eyes were very sharp. His sword started to glow and an extremely powerful sword Qi spread throughout the atmosphere and then pierced down through the atmosphere. It was aiming directly at each of the remaining two disciples. When the Qi pierced through their bodies, they both heavily collapsed onto the floor.The names of these five Disciples had now disappeared from the stone on which the ranking list was engraved.\u201cSword of Nirvana\u2026 how powerful. What a terrifying sword force! how strong!\u201dMany of the ordinary disciples and even elite disciples were looking at Lin Feng with adoration filling their eyes. No wonder that he had dared to provoke Wen Ren Yan. Lin Feng abilities and natural talent was much higher than that of Wen Ren but his cultivation was lower due to less time practicing. With enough time he would definitely be stronger than Wen Ren Yan.Liu Fei\u2019s pretty eyes were wide open. She was shaking at what he had just witnessed. That bastard had killed five ranked elite disciples?\u201cIt seems like I\u2019ll never be able to get my revenge and defeat him.\u201dLiu Fei was thinking. Her main goal was to get stronger and defeat Lin Feng. But she wouldn\u2019t have thought that the lowly bastard was even stronger and more talented than she had initially thought. It seemed like it would be impossible for her to take her revenge in this lifetime. But Liu Fei refused to stop working hard as one day she might have the chance to gain the advantage again.Nan Gong Ling was making a wry smile while looking at the fighting stage.\u201cThat guy\u2026 killing five extremely talented ranked elite disciples without any hesitation\u2026\u201d\u201cPatriarch, even though they were fairly strong disciples, they were exterminating their fellow disciples so ruthlessly. Maybe they would be a calamity for the sect in the end.\u201dMo Xie moved and whispered something to Nan Gong Ling.Nan Gong Ling looked at Mo Xie and seemed to be really disappointed. He then said: \u201cWhen these five disciples slaughtered their fellow disciples and when Wen Ren Yan approved it, why didn\u2019t you say anything at that moment?\u201d\u201cPatriarch, how could Lin Feng\u2026.?\u201d started to ask Mo Xie.\u201cAlright, I have a pretty clear idea of everything that is going on at the moment.\u201d Nan Gong Ling was annoyed for being interrupted Mo Xie. Mo Xie had no choice but to step back. He couldn\u2019t help but look at Lin Feng as he still hoped in his heart that he would get the chance to kill him. Mo Xie wanted to kill Lin Feng more with each passing day. He couldn\u2019t bear being in the Yun Hai Sect while Lin Feng was still breathing.\u201cLin Feng.\u201dNan Gong Ling was looking at Lin Feng who was standing on the fighting stage with a smile on his face.\u201cPatriarch.\u201dLin Feng turned around and looked at Nan Gong Ling who was standing up.\u201cIt was already clear to you that your strength would enable you to win these ranked battles. But before joining, wasn\u2019t there something you needed to do?\u201d asked Nan Gong Ling with a smile on the corner of his mouth. Lin Feng made him feel even more gratified each day. Not only was Lin Feng extremely strong, powerful and naturally gifted, but he was also polite. He wasn\u2019t arrogant at all. Lin Feng was stubborn but he fought for his convictions. Considering how talented and strong he was, he still acted as if he was an ordinary person.On the other hand, he could understand things and draw conclusions, like when he had said that Cultivators who had reached the Ling Qi layer were actually weak when considering the whole Continent of the Nine Clouds.Lin Feng was also thinking about his future and thought that he could climb up within the hierarchy at some point and occupy a high position in the country or even in the continent.\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Lin Feng.\u201cPut on your elite disciples robes.\u201dNan Gong Ling laughed. Lin Feng was really an unconventional genius\u2026 wearing his old ordinary disciple robes in the presence of extremely important people such as Duan Tian Lang wasn\u2019t appropriate.\u201cHehe.\u201d Lin Feng had a smile filled with a hidden meaning on his face. He shook his head and said: \u201cI will not put on the elite disciple robes and I will also not become a ranked elite disciple. If I fought on the fighting stage of the Life and Death Arena, it was just to show these few people how ignorant they were.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Nan Gong Ling frowned. He was puzzled and thus asked: \u201cWhat is that supposed to mean? Can you please explain?\u201d\u201cPatriarch, ordinary disciples don\u2019t count as genuine disciples of the Yun Hai Sect and they are able to leave the Sect as they wish, correct?\u201dLin Feng\u2019s words made Nan Gong Ling\u2019s heart pound like mad. He was very confused but didn\u2019t show anything and just said: \u201cCorrect.\u201d\u201cPatriarch, I hope that you can forgive me for this but from this point forwards I am no longer a member of the Yun Hai Sect.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dLin Feng\u2019s words stunned a great multitude of people. Lin Feng wanted to leave the Yun Hai Sect?!What kind of joke was that? Lin Feng was standing on the fighting stage within the Life and Death Arena like a warlord adored and respected by everyone\u2026 but then he suddenly said he would leave the sect. How were people supposed to feel after hearing these words? How could they not be stunned?Everybody wanted to understand why Lin Feng would act in such a way. They needed explanations.\u201cHahahaha\u2026\u2026..\u201d an insane laughter emerged. Duan Tian Lang was laughing and laughing. He then looked at Nan Gong Ling and said: \u201cThe Yun Hai Sect has to go through some hardship I see. How horrible for you to have to say goodbye to such an amazing disciple. How amusing! It\u2019s really funny.\u201d\u201cLin Feng, right? You can come to the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue where you will receive everything that you need to become an even stronger cultivator.\u201d\u201cLin Feng, my sect, the Ice and Snow Mountain Village usually only accepts cultivators who possess an ice or snow spirit. Today, I can make an exception and accept you. If you are willing to join us, I will make you a core disciple right away.\u201d\u201cSame for our Hao Yue Sect, if you want to join us then I can arrange that you will be a core disciple.\u201dA few of the powers were trying to make Lin Feng join their sects in the presence of the entire Yun Hai Sect which made them furious. The cheeks of the Yun Hai Sect members were burning. They found themselves feeling incredibly humiliated at such actions.\u201cI will think about it.\u201d said Lin Feng in a detached tone while smiling.\u201cWhat a little bastard! If he doesn\u2019t die now then the entire Yun Hai Sect will be humiliated as well as its dead disciples!\u201d shouted Mo Xie furiously. He was smiling coldly in his heart though. Lin Feng was going to get in trouble because of his own actions.\u201cShut the hell up!\u201d shouted Nan Gong Ling furiously which stupefied Mo Xie. Mo Xie was stunned when he saw that Nan Gong had a cold smile on his face.\u201cLin Feng, three days ago, I personally made you an elite disciple. You used to be eager to become an elite disciple. What has happened? Why would you want to leave the Yun Hai Sect and rebel against it?\u201dNan Gong Ling was struggling to remain calm. It wasn\u2019t easy to see a genius who wanted to leave the Sect. Could it be that other members of the sect had threatened him that if he didn\u2019t leave, they would kill him?\u201cRebel against it and leave? Patriarch, the word \u201crebel\u201d is not really appropriate. In fact, it is the Yun Hai Sect which has already abandoned me. In the sect, it seems impossible for me to earn my place.\u201d\u201cExplain.\u201d said Nan Gong Ling who was full of doubts.\u201cFirst, I would like to ask the Patriarch a few questions, is it possible?\u201d\u201cOf course, you can.\u201d\u201cPatriarch, as an ordinary disciple, one has nobody to learn from. One can only rely on one\u2019s self. Is that right?\u201d asked Lin Feng.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d said Nan Gong Ling while nodding. In fact, this was the way it had always been. Even elite disciples who received cultivation teachings from elders were extremely small in number.\u201cPatriarch, as an ordinary disciple, one can only access the first floor of the Xing Chen Pavilion if one wants to learn new skills and agility techniques. All of these skills and agility skills are of the yellow level. One can access these skills and agility techniques anywhere else. Many places provide these skills and techniques. Is that right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019 right.\u201d said Nan Gong Ling nodding again.\u201cSince it\u2019s that way, everything that I\u2019ve been learning until now, all the progress that I\u2019ve made on the path of Cultivation, would it be wrong to say that it is all only due to my hard work and that I learnt everything alone? Therefore, since there are no strong ties between the Yun Hai Sect and me, would it be wrong to assert that the Yun Hai Sect means almost nothing to me? That it is almost useless for me to be a Yun Hai Sect member?\u201dWhen Nan Gong Ling heard Lin Feng\u2019s words, his face changed and he went pale. The entire crowd also found themselves pale at the thought, but nobody could deny what Lin Feng had said.At that moment, Nan Gong Ling nodded again and said: \u201cYou are right, the Yun Hai Sect means almost nothing to you but you are a Yun Hai Sect member after all. Leaving because the Yun Hai Sect has given you nothing is the wrong reason. It\u2019s illogical. However, if you want to leave for other reasons, because of your own personal interests, then it would definitely be ungrateful.\u201d\u201cPatriarch, please wait until I finish talking.\u201d\u201cGo ahead.\u201d said Nan Gong Ling.\u201cThe first time that you and I met was here in the Life and Death Arena. I was unpopular and nobody knew me. I was a nobody. Chu Zhan Peng came with Lin Qian. They wanted to take me away and because I was only an ordinary disciple, Elder Mo Xie wanted to hand me over to them very quickly. At that moment, you didn\u2019t know that I wasn\u2019t as weak as everyone thought. If I hadn\u2019t been able to stop you from expelling me from the sect then I would most likely no longer be a sect member. Is that right?\u201d\u201cI made a huge mistake on that day.\u201d said Nan Gong Ling admitting his fault. Everyone was touched and moved.Nan Gong Ling was an open minded individual.\u201cPatriarch, when the flood of ferocious beasts happened, while I was there hunting and not bothering anyone, Mo Xie, who profoundly hates me, attacked me again because I was a mere ordinary disciple. He tried to hand me over to the extremely dangerous ferocious beasts. He tried to kill me. When people saw that I hadn\u2019t died, they started to believe in my strength\u2026 but Mo Xie, as before, didn\u2019t get punished at all because I was a simple ordinary disciple. I am a bit weak. I\u2019m not worth it. Is that right?\u201dNan Gong Ling was speechless. That was indeed the second time that he had made a big mistake. If Lin Feng hadn\u2019t been strong enough, he may have died because of Mo Xie.At that moment, Nan Gong Ling was staring at Mo Xie. Lin Feng wanted to leave the Yun Hai Sect and Mo Xie looked like he was refuting any responsibility.\u201cThat was my second big mistake.\u201d admitted Nan Gong Ling for the second time. \u201cLin Feng, I want you to know that Protector Bei was furious because of that issue. He even injured Mo Xie because of that. He almost killed Mo Xie at that moment. You have a privileged place in Protector Bei\u2019s heart. I think that he would be devastated if you left the Yun Hai Sect.\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 - No CompromisePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayProtector Bei cared so much about Lin Feng that he had nearly killed Mo Xie?Nan Gong Ling wasn\u2019t trying to avoid talking about taboo subjects as there was too much at stake right now. When he said that, many Elders made a strange face. They all knew what kind of person Protector Bei was and surprisingly, he cared so much about Lin Feng?Not too far behind Nan Gong Ling, there was another Elder who made a very strange face. It was Lu Yuan.\u201cFool, no wonder Xue Yue had protected Lin Feng in front of the ranking list. No wonder he took action to stop me.\u201d Lu Yuan was making a depressed face. He would have never thought that Lin Feng had such a terrifying background. He was protected by Protector Bei. He suddenly understood why Xue Yue had told him that he was going to regret his actions of that day.Lin Feng was also moved. He didn\u2019t know that after what had happened with the Imaginary Demon, Protector Bei had become so furious that he had tried to kill Mo Xie. Lin Feng felt bad because he was unable to return the favor and the one person that he really appreciated was Protector Bei.Lin Feng was reluctant to leave the Yun Hai Sect because of the protectors who had shown him such kindness. He also had some really good friends such as Han Man, Jing Yun, Protector Bei as well as Protector Kong and he would miss Liu Fei a little too.\u201cEven with the matter concerning Protector Bei, Mo Xie is an Elder who believes that he is above everybody else and frequently abuses his power. This is a fact.\u201d\u201cIn addition, three days ago when I went to pick up my Elite Disciple robes and my Elite Disciple certificate. Wen Ren Yan tried to kill me and he attacked my friends. Wen Ren Yan is also a Yun Hai Sect disciple. I will of course not blame the Yun Hai Sect for this but Elder Lu Yuan was there and did nothing to prevent it from happening.\u201d\u201cBut Lu Yuan is a Yun Hai Sect Elder. Not only did he not try to prevent it from happening but he also said I should die because I wasn\u2019t as strong as Wen Ren Yan. Is everyone in the sect, who is not as strong as Wen Ren Yan or even stronger supposed to die? All of this is the truth. When the confrontation was over, I asked for my Elite Disciple robes and certificate twice but Lu Yuan just replied with one phrase: get lost.\u201dWhen Lin Feng finished talking, everybody understood what he meant. It was all because he was still considered as an ordinary disciple and because he hadn\u2019t been able to get his Elite Disciple robes and certificate. This had all happened because of another Elder within the sect abusing their power to punish him. Lu Yuan had used his power as an elder to attempt to win favor with Wen Ren Yan by oppressing Lin Feng.At that moment, everybody was staring at Lu Yuan. He was shaking from head to toe in fear. His entire body felt like a giant weight was pressing down on him. Would he have acted the same if he had known that this would happen?\u201cLu Yuan, is what Lin Feng said true?\u201dNan Gong Ling\u2019s tone was indifferent but he still sounded firm and imposing. He would not tolerate if Lu Yuan lied in this situation.\u201cPatriarch.\u201dLu Yuan was looking down at the ground. He didn\u2019t dare look at Nan Gong Ling. At that moment, he infinitely regretted what he had done. What had happened because of him? He had provoked Lin Feng because of Wen Ren Yan. However was Wen Ren Yan going to help him today? He had to face the consequences of his actions alone.When Nan Gong Ling saw Lu Yuan\u2019s reaction, he immediately understood what had happened. There was no need for more explanations, everything that Lin Feng had said was true\u2026 and he even kept calling himself an ordinary disciple. What a tragedy!\u201cAlright\u2026 Alright\u2026 You have a lot of authority but I respect everyone who can become one of the elite disciples with their own power. When you told him to get lost, you were indirectly telling me to get lost, right?\u201d\u201cI would never dare.\u201dLu Yuan couldn\u2019t help but lower his head and look down at the ground. He felt a cold shiver run down his spine. He was only an ordinary Elder within the sect, he did not hold any special rank or status. He wasn\u2019t as strong as other Elder\u2019s either. Mo Xie and Lu Yuan were not comparable, Mo Xie would try to kill Lin Feng every time he laid eyes upon him.\u201cI will never forget this.\u201dNan Gong Ling sounded indifferent which made Lu Yuan panic. He did not know what Nan Gong Ling intended to do with him which is why he was terrified. He feared the unknown punishment he would recieve.Nan Gong Ling looked at Lin Feng and couldn\u2019t help but reveal a wry smile on his face. Each time they had met, someone had wanted to kill Feng and an Elder of the sect had wronged him.\u201cPatriarch, today, you have to understand me and what I had to go through. I don\u2019t know when Mo Xie will try to kill me again. I also don\u2019t know exactly how many people like Mo Xie and Lu Yuan there are in the sect. Even if an elite disciple is a high status within the Yun Hai Sect, it is still lower than that of an Elder. Much like all the times before, if an Elder wants to kill me, he can do it freely whenever he wants, as if I am nothing but a piece of trash that they can dispose of at any time. This is all that we disciples mean to the sect. \u201dEvery single word Lin Feng said was resonating deeply in everyone\u2019s heart. Everything was true so nobody could deny anything that he has said. Nan Gong Ling was also unable to refute anything which was just said.\u201cLin Feng, what do you want me, Nan Gong Ling, to do?\u201dNan Gong Ling was intently staring at Lin Feng while saying these words.Everybody was astonished. Because Nan Gong Ling wanted Lin Feng to stay, it seemed like he had completely put aside his status of Patriarch. It even sounded like Nan Gong Ling was begging Lin Feng to stay.\u201cIn fact, all of this is not happening because of you. It is happening because in this world, strength and power are the most important things. Without strength or power then your life is not valued. This is exactly where the problem lies and it has deep roots within the sects.\u201dWhen Lin Feng saw how Nan Gong Ling was handling the matter, he had a good feeling. As a Patriarch, he forgot about prestige and glory and was losing face, but he didn\u2019t care. He knew that apologizing a few times and admitting one\u2019s faults was the right thing to do. That way, Nan Gong Ling showed that he loved and cherished all of his disciples. He did not protect his face and understood he had been wrong.\u201cPatriarch, you already told me that only those who are strong and powerful can be respected and are considered as important members but have you ever thought that outstanding disciples, just like everyone else had to start from the bottom while being called worthless? Everyone within this world, no matter how powerful was at one point a low leveled cultivator. All of us never stop progressing and each person has their own pace. Imagine if low level cultivators with an incredible potential think that they are not important at the beginning because they did not progress as fast as others. If they think they mean nothing to the Yun Hai Sect then how discouraged will they be in their future cultivation? How are they supposed to have faith in the sect once they become strong? How can they believe they will ever been considered as important and that they will be cherished?\u201dLin Feng\u2019s words made Nan Gong Ling think about the sect itself. Indeed, strong disciples had also all started from the very basics but they were noticed by the sect only once they made a display of their own abilities, only once they stood out. Some of them were considered so weak initially that they were targeted much like Lin Feng and even when they became strong, those who hated them continued to target them.\u201cThe same punishments are applied no matter who breaks the rules, regardless of whether it is an ordinary disciple, an elite disciple or even an Elder who breaks the rules. That\u2019s the only way to live in harmony and advance together. There should be many cases where Elders have randomly killed disciples. If the rules are broken, the violator, no matter who he is, should be punished.\u201d\u201cDisciples and Elders should be punished the same way. The violator, no matter who he is, should be punished.\u201dNan Gong Ling looked perplex. Indeed, in the Continent of the Nine Clouds, strong cultivators also had to abide by the rules even if they had higher status or power. Why did this not apply within the Yun Hai Sect?Nan Gong Ling realized that he had made a lot of mistakes. Outside of the Sect, there were rules for everyone but what about the Yun Hai Sect? If it did not change then the same as what happened to Lin Feng would happen again. There were a few cultivators who were not respected when they were weak but actually had an infinite potential. Once they were strong, how were they supposed to respect the sect if they hadn\u2019t been respected before?\u201cThat guy is really a genius. He\u2019s so fascinating and wise. He has a lot to teach.\u201dThought Nan Gong Ling as he was looking at Lin Feng and then said in a very solemn tone: \u201cYou have just taught me and made me realize a great deal. Lin Feng. If someday, you were to be one of the leaders of the Yun Hai Sect, it would definitely enter a period of prosperity and glory. I really hope that you will stay.\u201dLin Feng, would someday become one of the leaders?Everybody was puzzled. Did Nan Gong Ling\u2019s words have a hidden meaning with further implications?Lin Feng shook his head. He didn\u2019t really care about these things, he just wanted to make everybody understand the error of their ways. He had a certain potential and could understand a lot of things but it maybe wasn\u2019t all that was needed to become a good leader.\u201cPatriarch, I don\u2019t feel like leaving the sect. I just want everybody to understand how ignorant and cruel they are behaving. I also want to have a reason to stay.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s words weren\u2019t as cold and sharp as before. Even Nan Gong Ling, Mo Xie and Lu Yuan felt calmer at that moment. Even if he stayed in the Yun Hai Sect, Lin Feng wouldn\u2019t devote himself to the Sect in the future. However, he admired and had a lot of esteem for Nan Gong Ling for the actions that he had taken today. Besides, leaving the Yun Hai Sect wasn\u2019t required. He just needed a reason for him to stay.\u201cLin Feng, I will prevent others from bullying and threatening you again. No need to say that I will even more do my best so that they don\u2019t try to kill you or that they make false charges against you.\u201dNan Gong Ling promised.\u201cThis is for the future. What about what happened before? All those people who have bullied and threatened me?\u201d said Lin Feng. Was this really justice?\u201cMy words were not devoid of substance. I will cripple Lu Yuan\u2019s cultivation and he will not be an Elder anymore. He will also be expelled from the sect.\u201dNan Gong Ling\u2019s words were sharp and poignant. Everybody was astonished. Nan Gong Ling was going to cripple an Elder\u2019s cultivation because of Lin Feng. This was a clear warning to everyone within the sect that things were changing.\u201cPatriarch, please forgive me!\u201d said Lu Yuan who turned deathly pale when he heard Nan Gong Ling\u2019s words. Crippling his cultivation and expelling him from the sect would make him turn into an existence even weaker than a normal person. How was he going to survive? He would have no reason to live anymore.\u201cYour crimes are unforgivable.\u201d said Nan Gong Ling firmly. Lu Yuan\u2019s cultivation had to be crippled for Lin Feng to find his peace of mind.\u201cWen Ren, save me!\u201dLu Yuan knew that Nan Gong Ling wasn\u2019t going to take back his words. He was unable to make Nan Gong Ling change his mind so he shouted these words to Wen Ren Yan.But at that moment, Wen Ren Yan was trying to find a way to deal with Lin Feng. How could he care about Lu Yuan? He coldly glanced at Lu Yuan and then ignored him again which made Lu Yuan feel like he had been betrayed.\u201cHeartless and unfair!\u201d thought Lu Yuan.Lu Yuan understood what Lin Feng had meant. Wen Ren Yan did not care for anyone but himself and was not someone who would care about any past ties. Lu Yuan had now understood that it was useless to back Wen Ren Yan, but he had made Lin Feng suffer a lot and it was too late for regrets.\u201cLin Feng, are you satisfied now?\u201d asked Nan Gong Ling.Lin Feng looked at Nan Gong Ling with a calm face and shook his head.\u201cPatriarch, it seems like you continue to forget about someone.\u201dNan Gong Ling smiled wryly while looking at Lin Feng. This guy was really stubborn.Everybody was stunned at what they had just heard and then they all looked at Mo Xie. They obviously understood that Lin Feng meant Mo Xie should be the next person to be punished. If it wasn\u2019t Mo Xie, who else could it be?But many people had thought that Lin Feng would be satisfied just because Nan Gong Ling had taken action on his behalf. Nan Gong Ling had asked him if it could be considered enough, which was a hint that he should consider the whole problem as solved.After all, Mo Xie was an important person within the sect. Not only is Mo Xie an Elder with extremely high status but his father was a Great Elder. He had a lot of power and influence within the sect. If Nan Gong Ling punished Mo Xie, he would indirectly be punishing his father as well. Nan Gong Ling was in a very critical situation.But for Lin Feng, there was no compromise. His words were like a sword which intended to behead Mo Xie.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 - The Sword ForcePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMo Xie looked at Lin Feng with an ice cold look which was filled with killing intent. This brat really didn\u2019t know anything about power and status. Did he think that just because he was a genius that he could get Mo Xie into trouble?\u201cThat is ridiculous.\u201d said Mo Xie firmly.\u201cPatriarch, Duan Tian Lang and the others are here to watch our Elite Disciple Exam. We should continue without delays.\u201dMo Cang Lan had been sitting there all along and finally opened his mouth. His eyes had a certain chill emanating from them. He remained silent about the events as the situation was still not clear to him. Protector Bei had tried to kill Mo Xie? He was furious? After all the years that he had spent in the Yun Hai Sect, Protector Bei had tried to kill Mo Cang Lan\u2019s son because of this disciple?Could it be that Nan Gong Ling wanted Mo Xie to kneel down and admit his faults in front of everyone that was present just because of that young disciple?When Nan Gong Ling heard Mo Cang Lan, he could not help but continue to smile wryly. If Mo Cang Lan hadn\u2019t been there, maybe that Nan Gong Ling would have punished Mo Xie but Nan Gong Ling had joined the Yun Hai Sect after Mo Cang Lan. Mo Cang Lan was a senior member of the Yun Hai Sect. Nan Gong Ling could penalize Mo Xie to make Lin Feng feel better but he wouldn\u2019t dare to interfere with Mo Cang Lan.Nan Gong Ling was in a dilemma.As a Patriarch, he really had to think and properly analyze situation. He was caught between a rock and a hard place.\u201cLin Feng, let\u2019s continue with the Elite Disciple Exam and discuss that problem later, alright?\u201dWhen Lin Feng heard Nan Gong Ling, he clearly understood that his status was still not high enough. An Elite Elder who had a father who was a Great Elder\u2026 they were more important than a junior disciple even if he was a never seen before genius. But Mo Xie needed to be punished for what he had made Lin Feng go through\u2026Did Lin Feng still have to submit to humiliation and keep being bullied because he was weak?If Mo Xie didn\u2019t get punished then he would continue to humiliate and threaten Lin Feng or even try to kill him, because he knew that Nan Gong Ling would never do anything against him because of his father.Lin Feng shook his head. He looked more determined than ever. Even though he was weak, he was still a human being and a disciple of the sect. He deserved dignity and honor like everyone else.Mo Xie definitely wanted to kill Lin Feng and he had tried to kill him a few times already. If Nan Gong Ling didn\u2019t try to do what Lin Feng wanted then Lin Feng would continue to be bullied by Mo Xie and other with high status within the sect. Mo Xie would keep thinking that he could do anything without having to bear the consequences for his actions.\u201cPatriarch, I understand that Mo Xie\u2019s status is high within the sect and that his father is even higher and more important, but does it mean that they can keep bullying and threatening me? Why would I stay within the Yun Hai Sect if I am to remain in constant danger?\u201dLin Feng was being extremely firm on this point. Mo Xie had to be punished for his actions. There was no other alternative that Lin Feng would accept.The atmosphere in the Stormy Gorge was completely silent. Everybody was watching the events occurring in suspense. Lin Feng or the Elite Elder Mo Xie, everyone wanted to know whom Nan Gong Ling was planning to choose.\u201cHow stubborn.\u201dMany people were smiling wryly inside. Lin Feng was being so firm and determined that Nan Gong Ling had to decide then and there. How stubborn!\u201cThis is ridiculous!\u201dAn extremely loud voice spread throughout the atmosphere. It was an elite disciple who was also present at the current events. He was actually a ranked elite disciple and he was ranked twenty first within the power rankings.\u201cIt\u2019s really a bunch of nonsense, Lin Feng! Elder Mo Xie has an important status in the sect and he\u2019s extremely strong. What do you think you can do? Mo Xie humiliated and accused a simple ordinary disciple of crimes, so what? You still dare open your filthy mouth and talk nonsense. I am really ashamed to be a member of the same sect as you. I feel dirty and humiliated.\u201dThe young man had an ice cold tone and dared say that Lin Feng\u2019s words were nonsense.When Mo Xie heard that disciple speak, he had a big smile on his face and looked at that disciple with a look of approval.\u201cLei Bo, there is no need to lower yourself to the same level as this foul mouthed little brat. The Patriarch is a wise man. I know that his decision will be fair and partial.\u201d\u201cElder, I obviously know that the Patriarch is a wise man but that little brat who regards himself as a genius is just too insolent. If I came across him during the Elite Disciple Exam, I would definitely kill him.\u201dLei Bo said to Mo Xie. They both said that Nan Gong Ling was a wise man to flatter him, if Nan Gong Ling punished Mo Xie, then obviously this would be the actions of a fool.\u201cI see that Mo Xie raised many stray dogs. No wonder that he is respected by so many and allows himself to murder so many disciples of the sect.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s words were extremely sharp. He was looking at Mo Xie in a mocking way. Lei Bo had wanted to protect Mo Xie and he was about to pay the price for it.\u201d\u201cWhat a filthy mouth.\u201dMo Xie cursed at Lin Feng and glanced at Lei Bo indicating that he was happy to receive his help.\u201cPatriarch, I, Lei Bo, am an open minded and kindhearted person but Lin Feng has insulted and humiliated me. He called me a stray dog. He\u2019s an animal. I would like to challenge him to a battle in the Life and Death Arena. I hope that Patriarch has no objection.Lei Bo was furious and asked Nan Gong Ling for permission to challenge Lin Feng.Nan Gong Ling frowned. Lei Bo was ranked twenty first and he had already broken through to the third Ling Qi layer. He was extremely powerful within the elite disciples. Even a cultivator of the second Ling Qi layer could never compete with him. Even though Lin Feng was extremely masterful when using his sword, the cultivation gap between them was gigantic. It would be too dangerous for Lin Feng to fight against him with only the first Ling Qi Layer.When Nan Gong Ling was about to refuse, Lin Feng started speaking.\u201cPatriarch, I am an open minded and kindhearted person but Mo Xie humiliated and bullied me. Then this little stray doggy of his dares say I have a filthy mouth\u2026 there is no need for him to ask the Patriarch for permission to battle against me. Let\u2019s just do it!\u201dLin Feng raised his head and looked at Nan Gong Ling in an indifferent way. Lin Feng was so confident with his words that Nan Gong Ling\u2019s heart started to beat faster.Could it be that Lin Feng had hidden his real strength?When Nan Gong Ling thought that Lin Feng may have hidden his true strength, he became really curious to see and couldn\u2019t help but say: \u201cI allow you to battle.\u201d\u201cThank you, Patriarch.\u201d said Lei Bo while looking at Nan Gong Ling, who actually seemed to be really excited. He then moved towards the central fighting stage and climbed up onto it. He was then facing Lin Feng.\u201cThis battle is a Life and Death battle. We both need to put our lives at stake. The Patriarch said it himself. Lin Feng, today everybody will see you die like a dog.\u201dLei Bo said these words in an aggressive tone as if he feared that Nan Gong Ling would go back on his words concerning the life and death battles.Lin Feng\u2019s words before were very aggressive. Mo Xie was unable to get out of this extremely embarrassing and awkward situation. If Lei Bo was able to kill Lin Feng then Mo Xie would take him as his personal disciples and help him improve his cultivation.\u201cYou are very confident.\u201d\u201cOf course. You just became an elite disciple. You\u2019re just a little brat. You may have natural abilities and a high potential but in front of me, a cultivator of the third Ling Qi layer, you are just too weak. I will not even need to release my spirit to kill you.\u201dWhen Lei Bo finished talking, a strong Qi was released from his body. It was so extremely powerful that the audience could feel the pressure from him releasing it. His body started releasing sparks into the air and even the dust that approached him exploded. As he moved the sound of thunder roared from his body.The different between a cultivator of the first and the third Ling Qi layer was colossal. Even a genius couldn\u2019t compete with a much stronger cultivator. Even if Lin Feng had mastered sword forces, it was still impossible for him to win.\u201cI can tell you, my spirit is a Thunder Spirit. I am as strong as thunder itself. My attacks are extremely powerful and quick. But you will not have the honor to see me release my spirit.\u201dLei Bo held his right hand up in the air. It started diffusing a dazzling light. It looked like he was using something extremely powerful.Possessors of a Thunder Spirit could carry out extremely strong attacks. Besides, each of their attacks was incredibly swift and skillful. Lei Bo hadn\u2019t broken through to the third Ling Qi layer for a long time and already had his name on the elite disciple ranking. He was ranked twenty first but he would soon be ranked twentieth.\u201cEight Strikes of Desolation.\u201dLin Feng didn\u2019t feel like talking to Lei Bo much longer. He thrust out his hand and six powerful strikes shot toward Lei Bo.\u201cHmph.\u201dLei Bo smiled coldly. Lin Feng\u2019s six strikes, at the moment when they had crashed into his thunder attack, disintegrated themselves in the blink of an eye.\u201d\u201cForce.\u201dLin Feng took a step forward and an extremely powerful sword force began to invade the entire atmosphere. The atmosphere was absorbed by the sword Qi and the sword force completely.He thrust his hand out again and another six strikes emerged and shot towards Lei Bo.But Lin Feng clearly knew that these attacks wouldn\u2019t affect Lei Bo too much. He suddenly dashed forward with incredible speed and a whistling sound quickly spread throughout the air. The entire atmosphere was filled with sword Qi and sword force as if his sword was the only thing which mattered in the entire arena.What was even scarier is that the sword force was getting more and more powerful as it absorbed the energy around it. The sword force was even stronger than what he had used to kill the other five ranked elite disciples.An incredible force started oppressing Lei Bo\u2019s body. Lei Bo had the feeling that he was being strangled and could hardly breathe. It was very painful as if his bones were about to be crushed from the pressure.\u201cSecond Ling Qi layer.\u201dLei Bo was stupefied and he then shouted: \u201cYou are not at the first Ling Qi layer, you are at the second Ling Qi layer!\u201dThe entire crowd was stupefied. Lin Feng had, once again, hidden his real strength! What a monstrous power! Not so long before, there was almost nobody who knew who Lin Feng was. In a very short time, Lin Feng had repeatedly made a display of his abilities and was now at the center of everyone\u2019s attention.Now with his mastery of forces coupled with his strength of the second Ling Qi layer he was definitely able to compete with a cultivator of the third Ling Qi layer. No wonder he had accepted to fight against Lei Bo without hesitation.\u201cThat young man is really a genius\u2026 and the speed at which he learns and masters skills\u2026\u201dNan Gong Ling felt like his body had gone numb. He still remembered the first time he had met Lin Feng. Lin Feng was still at the Qi layer. He was so weak. Even Lin Qian of the Hao Yue Sect could humiliate him back in those days. In such a short time, he had become so strong.Lin Feng had broken through to the Ling Qi layer and had killed five ranked elite disciples. At this moment, he was battling against a cultivator of the third Ling Qi layer and it looked like he had a great advantage over his opponent.\u201cYou just talk shit. You are too weak to be my opponent.\u201dLin Feng started moving so fast that it looked like he had disappeared. His sword tore through Lei Bo\u2019s clothes and Lei Bo felt an intense pain as if his flesh was being split apart piece by piece. The sword force was terrifying, it was the first time that Lei Bo felt such a strong force. He was terrified.\u201cDie!\u201d shouted Lei Bo.Thunderous roars started unceasingly spreading throughout the atmosphere and as they collided with the sword Qi they started releasing sparks. It looked like an incredible storm was being released from Lei Bo\u2019s body.Lin Feng thrust his palm forward.\u201cEight Strikes of Desolation.\u201dA terrifying attack was launched from Lin Feng\u2019s palm. His strikes were so powerful that they consumed the sky and covered the whole arena with a domineering power.\u201cDivine Thunder!\u201dLei Bo shouted extremely loudly and suddenly an extremely powerful thunderous roar came out of his hand and started bombarding the atmosphere. The whole crowd was blinded by the sight of such a powerful attack. It seemed like the deadly power contained within that lightning was endless. In the blink of an eye, it had disappeared as it struck against Lin Feng\u2019s eight strikes.\u201cSword unsheathing.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s strikes hadn\u2019t fully disappeared yet and his sword was already overflowing with an endless amount of sword force.Sword Unsheathing was a skill was a skill which required the utmost speed. The quicker it was, the more explosive its power was. It was a truly terrifying attack.Lin Feng\u2019s sword force was extremely powerful as it pierced through the atmosphere and consumed everything in its path.\u201cDivine Thunder of Wrath!\u201dLei Bo shouted extremely loudly and looked like his entire body was becoming a thunderstorm. Both his hands raised to strike against the atmosphere with all the power contained within a thunderstorm.\u201cBOOOOOOM!!!\u201dThe thunders collided with the sword Qi and the sword force. A dazzling light blinded the entire crowd and a scorching heat rushed outwards from the collision. The power of the shockwave was so strong that it would sting the disciple\u2019s skin and they couldn\u2019t even open their eyes.Lei Bo felt an incredibly intense and sharp pain come from his body. He would have never thought that Lin Feng could be this powerful.What terrified him was that the sword force contained within each of his strikes was growing stronger each time.That sword was surrounded by an incredible amount of sword force. Not only was it not weakening but it was also growing stronger which gave Lei Bo the impression that he was going to collapse under the weight of the sword force.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 - Pure InsanityPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cRoaring Thunder.\u201d Shouted Lin Feng.He then thrust his sword towards Lei Bo.The sword force which he unleashed started to combine with thunderous roars in the atmosphere. The atmosphere was being consumed by the immense power of the attack. In Lin Feng\u2019s hands, that yellow level attack coupled with sword force was as powerful as a Xuan Level skill.Roaring Thunder was filling the atmosphere with an incredibly explosive force.Lei Bo\u2019s hands were still unleashing a powerful thunder Qi. He had managed to block Lin Feng\u2019s Roaring Thunder but he was sent flying backwards while groaning in pain.Lin Feng\u2019s sword force started to consume more energy and grow even more powerful.\u201cI give up! I do not want to fight anymore.\u201dLei Bo shouted extremely loudly. He knew that he couldn\u2019t win against Lin Feng and on top of that, he was already wounded from attempting to block the last strike.The twenty first ranked elite disciple, who was at the third Ling Qi layer, suddenly wanted to give up when fighting against Lin Feng?The crowd sighed. Lin Feng who had only shown his power 3 days ago, he seemed to be invincible. He continued to shock people with his incredible strength.\u201cIf you look at him, it seems like he is around fifteen or has just turned sixteen.\u201dThe crowd was trying to guess how old Lin Feng was compared to his battle ability. They were even more stupefied when they thought about it. He was still sixteen years old and could defeat a cultivator of the third Ling Qi layer who was on the elite disciple rankings\u2026 How was that possible? Was he really human?Lin Feng stopped moving, his sleeves were swaying with the breeze, but the Qi and the sword force which filled the atmosphere were still omnipresent and just as oppressing as before. Lei Bo\u2019s body was still feeling the immense pressure crushing down on his body making it hard for him to breathe.\u201cGive up?\u201dLin Feng had a cold smile on the corner of his mouth: \u201cThis is a fight in which we both put our lives at stake. If I live, you die\u2026 and if I die, you live.\u201d\u201cWe are fellow disciples of the Yun Hai Sect and we don\u2019t hate each other so why do you need to kill me?\u201d said Lei Bo hoping to make Lin Feng change his mind.\u201cHow ridiculous! You think that I will fall for that? Could it be that you forgot what you said before this battle? You said that you could kill me whenever you wanted? You even said that you didn\u2019t even need to release your spirit to kill me. Have you also forgotten that this battle is a battle where our lives are at stake? You said it yourself. If you were stronger than me, would you still say that we are fellow disciples and let me live?\u201dLin Feng was disgusted by Lei Bo\u2019s words. Saying so easily that they were fellow disciples and that they didn\u2019t hate each other after everything that he had said before, he had to be insane.\u201cLin Feng, you are extremely strong but it would be impossible for you to kill me. Even if you defeat me, you will have to bear the consequences for it.\u201dLei Bo knew that Lin Feng wasn\u2019t going to let him off so he tried to threaten him.\u201cOh, is that so? Watch me then.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s eyes suddenly started to fill with killing intent and a smile appeared on his face. His sword released even more force coupled with thunderous roars.Lei Bo started to rub his eyes as he could not believe what he was seeing. He couldn\u2019t see Lin Feng anymore. Instead of Lin Feng, there was only a huge sword in front of him. That sword was glowing and coupled with the extremely bright light was a dark fog. In that dark fog, so many lights were sparkling that Lei Bo had the impression that a million swords were hiding within it. The black fog had started to move in his direction.Extremely loud thunder sounds spread throughout the atmosphere.Lei Bo shouted extremely loudly. Even more powerful and intense thunder emerged from his body. His body was coated in a Qi which was yellowish-blue, it contained the power of thunder and lightning.When they saw the light surrounding Lei Bo the crowd was surprised. What was Lei Bo doing exactly?Lin Feng\u2019s sword was more suited to battle. He didn\u2019t need to consume too much energy in order to carry out powerful attacks and he could also use it for protection. It gave the impression that Lin Feng was like a fortified mountain.The crowd didn\u2019t understand what was going on. The crowd could not see Lin Feng\u2019s sword the same way Lei Bo did.In Lei Bo\u2019s eyes, there were a million swords whose lights were dazzling and which were trying to kill him. Sword lights were shining everywhere inside the black fog and could take his life at any time.\u201cIt\u2019s the end for you.\u201d Said Lin Feng in a cold voice which stupefied the entire crowd.\u201cSword of Nirvana\u201dSword of Nirvana made his sword turn into a deadly sword. Each strike would take a life and it power defied the heavens. His sword descended from the heavens themselves towards Lei Bo.It seemed like his sword had pierced the heavens themselves. From a distance it could be seen that a hole was pierced through the clouds and the heavens had been pierced.It looked like his sword would destroy the entire universe if it stood against him.It was over with this strike. Lei Bo was finished.The entire crowd was blankly staring at that wonderfully mystical sword.The millions of swords as well as the black fog disappeared from Lei Bo\u2019s vision but his face revealed that he had given up all hope because there was a terrifying light which kept moving towards him. It was most likely the last light that he would see in his life.\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026\u2026.\u201dLei Bo\u2019s shout resonated everywhere in the Stormy Gorge but his body could not move. He was still stood on the stage motionless.After what seemed to be an eternity, a thin mark appeared between his eyebrows. It was a thin bloody mark which slowly started to pour with blood. His body fell heavily onto the fighting stage within the Life and Death Arena.That\u2019s what the Life and Death Arena was about: life and death!Did he die? The twenty first ranked elite disciple who had a Thunder Spirit had been killed?Lei Bo had wanted to protect Mo Xie. He had wanted to kill Lin Feng and gain the Elders favor. He would have never thought that he would become Lin Feng\u2019s stepping stone. At that moment, the Patriarch was secretly afraid that Lin Feng would start his verbal assault where he had left off.Even though the Elite Disciple Exam was about fighting, not many disciples had participated in it. This kind of event was unprecedented in the history of the Yun Hai Sect\u2019s Elite Disciple Exam. It had however been an extremely enlightening event and many disciples were forced to look deeply at their actions until now. There was not a single person who regretted watching these events unfold.The crowd of the Yun Hai Sect had realized that they were witnessing the rise of an incomparable genius.\u201cI want that young man!\u201dDuan Tian Lang\u2019s eyes were glowing. He then quickly glanced at Duan Han. Lin Feng\u2019s abilities and power were infinitely higher than that of his son, of whom he was already intensely proud.\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t join me, I will make sure he dies today. I will not allow him to rise up or let him become more powerful. He could become an extremely large obstacle.\u201dThe Patriarch of the Hao Yue Sect, Chu Qing, as well as Bing Han of the Ice and Snow Mountain Village thought the exact same thing. If Lin Feng continued becoming more and more powerful, he would definitely become one of the eight high officials!Lin Feng couldn\u2019t understand all these people\u2019s thoughts. He wasn\u2019t even as strong as Mo Xie. He was unable to kill Mo Xie but he definitely wanted to make him understand that he could not bully and threaten him as he wished.Since he hadn\u2019t showed all of his abilities so far, the sect did not recognize him. Then he just had to show them more.Holding his soft sword in the hand while his robes were swaying in the air, Lin Feng slowly glanced around at the Stormy Gorge.\u201cMo Xie, because he is an Elder, he dares to behave unscrupulously. He dares to try and kill disciples in cold blood. He is the shame and disgrace of the Yun Hai Sect. My current strength doesn\u2019t enable me to kill that scum of the sect. What I want is for that degenerate to get expelled from the sect.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe entire crowd was stunned, astonished, stupefied! Lin Feng had wild ambitions! He suddenly wanted Mo Xie to get expelled from the sect!That was almost impossible! If Mo Xie was expelled from the sect, Mo Cang Lan would completely lose face!\u201cThat guy really is insane.\u201dLiu Fei was looking at Lin Feng. She was speechless. She couldn\u2019t stand Mo Xie either but she had never thought of trying to get him expelled from the sect, not even in her dreams! It was impossible for an elite disciple to get an elite Elder expelled from the sect, but Lin Feng was not sparing any efforts in his attempt to remove Mo Xie.Mo Xie, who was sitting on the viewing platform looked ghastly pale. In his eyes, a mere disciple was less than a bug to him. They didn\u2019t even exist in his eyes and suddenly, there was a disciple on the fighting stage of the Life and Death Arena accusing him of various things and calling him the shame and the scum of the sect, and on top of that, he wanted to get him expelled from the sect. He had never been so humiliated in all of his life.He used to be the one who demanded that other people would be expelled from the sect. He used to be the one who expelled lowly disciples from the sect. However these things were now happening to him.If these things had happened at any other time before then he would have killed Lin Feng without the slightest hesitation.But that was almost impossible now because of Nan Gong Ling.As the Patriarch of the Yun Hai Sect, he had to give consideration to all parties. Mo Xie was an elite Elder and his father, Mo Cang Lan was a Great Elder. They were both given the great honor of enforcing the rules within the sect.As far as Lin Feng was concerned, he was one of the most extraordinary geniuses that the Yun Hai Sect had ever had. Wen Ren Yan would never be able to achieve the same level as Lin Feng, they were worlds apart. Lin Feng was also protected by Protector Bei.If he wanted Mo Xie to be a little bit penalized, that could possibly be arranged, however Lin Feng said that if Mo Xie was still in the Yun Hai Sect, then he would leave. Lin Feng\u2019s terms for staying within the sect was to expel Mo Xie from the sect.\u201cI know that Mo Xie\u2019s status is high and important, he is an Elite Elder. I also know that his father, Mo Cang Lan is a chief figure in the Yun Hai Sect and that he has dedicated his life to serving the Sect. I am also aware that I am currently a nobody within the sect and that my words carry little weight. I know that if Mo Xie commits crimes, I cannot do much but Mo Xie tried to kill me on multiple occasions. Even after being almost killed by Protector Bei he still had thoughts on taking my life. If he is not severely punished for his crimes, how am I supposed to put my mind at rest and stay within the sect?\u201d\u201cI just have my sword to show everyone what I am really capable of. This is my only way of proving to the Yun Hai Sect that having me is ten times, no, a hundred times better than having Mo Xie.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s words were inspiring. Lin Feng was even crazier than Wen Ren Yan but was in no way weaker than him.Everyone however was wondering how Lin Feng could prove that having him was a hundred times better than having Mo Xie.Nan Gong Ling was curious as well to know how Lin Feng could prove that.At that moment, Lin Feng, who was still standing on the central fighting stage of the Life and Death Arena, was just looking at many elite disciples sitting on the sidelines and declared: \u201cToday is the Elite Disciple Exam. I, Lin Feng, am now challenging any elite disciple who is willing to fight against me. Anyone can come and challenge me. No matter what kind of battle, normal or life and death battle, no matter how many I need to fight against, I will fight with anyone under any terms.\u201d\u201cWhat?!!\u201d people in the crowd were stunned. You could hear everyone\u2019s heartbeat start to intensify.\u201cHe\u2019s a madman. That guy is insane. He wants to challenge every elite disciple?!\u201dHow insane! Wen Ren Yan could even compete with core disciples. Even some of the disciples within the top ten elite disciples could fight with core disciples. They all had unique skills and abilities. They were much stronger than Lei Bo. Lin Feng suddenly dared to look at these elite disciples as if they were weaklings. What was going to happen?The crowd was just speechless. Could it be that Lin Feng was really insane? Had he lost his mind after defeating Lei Bo?But if he was able to defeat any of the elite disciples, then wouldn\u2019t he really prove to the Yun Hai Sect that having him was better than having Mo Xie. If he could defeat any elite disciple under their own terms then wasn\u2019t it even greater than a hundred times the worth of Mo Xie.\u201cThis bastard\u2026\u201dLiu Fei\u2019s magnificent eyes were wide open. Lin Feng was way too crazy. A short time before, he was only a simple ordinary disciple and nothing more.Han Man couldn\u2019t help but giggle. He was so proud to see Lin Feng, who was like a brother to him, on the fighting stage of the Life and Death Arena while issuing the challenge. He had a big smile on his face.Nan Gong Ling was also shocked beyond belief. He was completely stunned. Lin Feng wanted to challenge all of the elite disciples?Even though Lin Feng was naturally gifted, had he really become so terrifyingly strong?\u201cActually, as far as I can remember, he has not been using his spirit.\u201dNan Gong Ling suddenly had a realization; he realized that he had never seen Lin Feng release his spirit. He was extremely curious and he was excited to find out what Lin Feng\u2019s spirit was. Considering he had already mastered sword skills and sword forces, could it be that he had a sword spirit? If he had a Sword Spirit then he would probably be able to make his sword force even more powerful.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82 - The Rise of a GeniusPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCurrently there were some elite disciples whose eyes had lit up, especially the twenty at the top of the rankings.They all regarded themselves as geniuses. They were arrogant and prideful. But Lin Feng, who was on the fighting stage of the Life and Death Arena dared to talk conceited nonsense and challenge every elite disciple to battle against him.But many of them were worried about how strong Lin Feng really was, especially those close to Lei Bo within the rankings. Lin Feng was so strong that he had managed to kill Lei Bo and was even threatening all of them at that moment.What made them even more worried was that many of these geniuses had noticed that Lin Feng hadn\u2019t released his spirit at all. If he had a Sword Spirit, his strength would probably be monstrous. That would definitely be terrifying and incredibly dangerous to step on the same stage as him.Nobody had dared to reply to Lin Feng as many were deep in thought. The atmosphere was drowned into absolute silence. That silence was broken a few times by some of the sword Qi, which emanated from Lin Feng\u2019s body, ripping through the air.\u201cWen Ren Yan, you called me a piece of trash, a nobody and said that you can easily kill me. Do I need to come down and beg you to kill me? Now that you have an opportunity to kill me, what are you waiting for? Are you currently not scared to challenge like those you called worthless before? \u201dLin Feng was looking at Wen Ren Yan. When everyone heard his calm voice as he spat insults into Wen Ren Yan\u2019s face, they were all stupefied.Lin Feng was definitely someone who continued to surprise.He suddenly dared challenge the top ranked of all the elite disciples.Wen Ren Yan was at the peak of the third Ling Qi layer. Even though Lei Bo was at the same Ling Qi layer, nobody would dare compare Lei Bo and Wen Ren Yan. They had nothing in common at all.Cultivators of the same Ling Qi layer were not necessarily comparable. For example, Lin Feng was at the second Ling Qi layer but could defeat and kill Lei Bo who was at the third Ling Qi layer. The skills practiced and battle experience played an extremely important role regardless of the layer reached.Wen Ren Yan was also similar to Lin Feng. He had broken through to the third Ling Qi layer but many core disciples of the fourth Ling Qi layer didn\u2019t dare provoke him.\u201cYou are overestimating your abilities. Just because you killed Lei Bo doesn\u2019t mean that you can compete with me. Lei Bo was nothing in comparison with me. In my eyes, Lei Bo was the same as you, a piece of trash, a nobody.\u201dWen Ren Yan, was looking at Lin Feng with eyes filled with disdain. Lin Feng wasn\u2019t weak but challenging Wen Ren Yan was like committing suicide. Strength is strength. In Wen Ren Yan\u2019s eyes, Lin Feng was a weak piece of trash.\u201cYou talk so much shit. Is it because you want to show off in front of everybody?\u201dLin Feng didn\u2019t understand what Wen Ren Yan exactly meant. Lin Feng then added: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be like that. Since you are so powerful and that you consider me as a piece of trash, as a nobody, then just climb up onto the fighting stage immediately. Show everybody how strong you are and kill me. Show everybody your real power. Actions will always be better that the drivel from your mouth. Everybody will believe you when you come onto this fighting stage and prove your words or you can continue to hide there and talk big.\u201d\u201cEverybody can talk big. Lei Bo also called me a piece of trash before I killed him. He said he was stronger than me. What happened in the end?\u201dLin Feng\u2019s words were straightforward and he was clearly provoking Wen Ren Yan but what he was saying was actually the truth. Anyone can talk big but it only matters if your actions can prove what you say.If Wen Ren Yan climbed onto the fighting stage of the Life and Death Arena, he would gain infinite glory. He would be regarded as an amazing talent by everyone in the sect. But he wasn\u2019t doing it at all.Not only didn\u2019t he climb onto the fighting stage but he kept talking and talking, bragging about how amazing he was.In his eyes, Lin Feng was just a nobody, an insect which he could crush at anytime. Since Lin Feng could be crushed at any time, why did he need to fight? Talking and humiliating Lin Feng was enough but was that enough to be regarded as a strong cultivator?Wen Ren Yan glanced at the people standing next to him who were still looking as arrogant as ever.\u201cYou guys go and kill him. I will give you the glory of killing him.\u201dMany people\u2019s eyes were glowing with killing intent when they heard Wen Ren Yan. Wen Ren Yan was considered a great cultivator by everyone. The glory for killing him\u2026 they all know what it meant.Wen Ren Yan had a lot of profound pills. There was a profound pill which he had in abundance: a sort of pill which had a deadly attraction force.\u201cI\u2019m going to kill him.\u201d said a silhouette while moving towards the fighting stage. It was a young man aged seventeen, no older than eighteen. He gaze was as sharp as a dagger. He looked to have an extremely brutal nature.\u201cTong Shou, the blade master.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s him. Lin Feng is in trouble.\u201dThe young disciple came out from the crowd. When Tu Fu had become a core disciple, there were two extremely respected and strong elite disciples: Wen Ren Yan and Tong Shou.Even though Tong Shou was ranked sixth on the elite disciple rankings, nobody had doubts concerning the fact that Tong Shou was much stronger than the four others who were above him in the rankings.That was because Tong Shou\u2019s spirit was a Blade Spirit. If Tong Shou only had a blade spirit, people wouldn\u2019t have so much faith in him but he was similar to Lin Feng with his mastery of force, he was able to control blade forces.Tong Shou wasn\u2019t able to master blade forces like Lin Feng mastered sword forces. There was actually a huge gap between them as far as forces were concerned. However, Tong Shou had already broken through to the third Ling Qi layer which would bridge the gap in strength between their forces.Tong Shou versus Lin Feng, it should be a very balanced battle.\u201cAlright, go ahead. Don\u2019t immediately kill him. When the time of his last breath comes, make him kneel down in front of me so that he understands before he dies that I am much stronger than him. The difference between him and me is colossal.\u201dWen Ren Yan said that in an indifferent tone.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I understand.\u201dTong Shou slightly nodded and then went up onto the central fighting stage. He was facing Lin Feng and looking as if he had already won.He then grabbed the long knife that he had on his back then said in a voice filled with hatred: \u201cI have used this knife for a long time. Being killed by it should be an honor for you.\u201d\u201cIf I properly understand, you\u2019re implying that you choose to have a battle where one of us must die, correct?\u201dLin Feng asked that question in an indifferent tone.\u201cDo you think that I have time to play with you?\u201dTong Shou was looking at Lin Feng in an evil way. His expression was sharp and poignant like his knife. His body was radiating killing intent.Tong Shou grabbed his long knife and caressed it as if it was his beloved girlfriend.\u201cThe knife is an extremely powerful weapon. It\u2019s the best of all bladed weapons. The Blade Spirit is also an extremely powerful spirit.\u201d Said Tong Shou.\u201cI\u2019ve always hard that swords were the best bladed weapons. It\u2019s really the first time that I have heard that a knife is the best of all bladed weapons.\u201dLin Feng was calling in question what Tong Shou said.\u201cWhat do you know about such things? A blade from a sword is too heavy. Sword force is also much harder to control. How could you even compare a knife and a sword? Today, I will show you what a knife is. You will understand that it is the best bladed weapon ever.\u201d Said Tong Shou.A powerful energy emerged from his long knife and spread throughout the atmosphere like a fierce flood. It seemed like it was cutting everything in its path.\u201cBlade force.\u201dLin Feng was surprised. How could that guy brag about his knife? Lin Feng also mastered forces and the force of that knife was quite weak in comparison.Lin Feng\u2019s sword emitted a whistling sound. The atmosphere was filled with two opposing forces. The forces on the fighting stage were extremely sharp and were piercing and cutting everything within their path.\u201cBlade force against Sword Force\u2026 How terrifying!\u201dMany people who were close to the fighting stage were projected back by the forces which had just been released. Many could feel the oppressive nature of these forces. They were too close. They had the feeling that they were going to be cut and pierced by the confrontation of the two forces.\u201cBut it seems like Tong Shou\u2019s knife will be much stronger. After all, he is a cultivator of the third Ling Qi layer. He\u2019s much stronger than Lin Feng. It looks like Lin Feng was unlucky this time.\u201d\u201cSo, do you still think that swords are better than knives?\u201dTong Shou was arrogantly looking at Lin Feng.\u201cIgnorant.\u201d snorted Lin Feng.Lin Feng didn\u2019t reply to Tong Shou\u2019s question and was sneering at him.\u201cI\u2019m ignorant? Alright, I will show you who the ignorant one is.\u201dWhen Tong Shou finished talking, the force released from his knife became even stronger and more powerful. It seemed like it was going to completely envelop the sword force and Qi.\u201cCelestial Spirit!\u201d thought Lin Feng.Lin Feng released his spirit but didn\u2019t say anything. Everything around him started to change into a world of darkness.The entire world was now covered in complete darkness. He became omniscient. He could feel and sense every single bit of blade force and sword force around him. He knew where every single particle of energy was situated and exactly how they were moving around in the atmosphere.Lin Feng\u2019s eyes had turned completely pitch black. They looked like black holes.\u201cThe knife is the best bladed weapon. It is too powerful. A sword is not even comparable with such a magnificent weapon.\u201dTong Shou took a step forward and suddenly the color of the atmosphere changed. It was filled with the horrifying blade force from his knife.Tong Shou moved towards Lin Feng and he looked like he was invincible. An incredibly powerful strength seemed to fall from the sky onto Lin Feng\u2019s body and then started oppressing Lin Feng.\u201cLaceration!\u201dTong Shou shouted extremely loudly as he stabbed forward with his knife. It seemed like even the sky could not stop itself from being lacerated.Lin Feng looked as calm and serene. He remained absolutely fearless as he stood there. It seemed like he completely disregarded the power of Tong Shou\u2019s knife.The glowing light of his sword started rising into the air towards the atmosphere where Tong Shou\u2019s blade force was the weakest.\u201cBOOM!\u201dNan Gong Ling\u2019 heart was pounding. Tong Shou\u2019s knife was like a hot knife cutting through butter. It was as fast as lightning with its attack. Lin Feng\u2019s sword force kept being lacerating by the force contained within the knife. It seemed like Lin Feng\u2019s body could get lacerated at any second. Instead of dodging, Lin Feng had used his sword to counterattack, why?Even though Lin Feng could use his sword in an extremely skillful way, the force of his sword wasn\u2019t as strong as Tong Shou\u2019s blade force. If Lin Feng could get rid of Tong Shou\u2019s blade force then there probably wouldn\u2019t be any problem but that seemed impossible. If Lin Feng didn\u2019t dodge the attacks then Lin Feng\u2019s body would be cut into two.During that extremely short amount of time, Nan Gong Ling had a million thoughts rushing through his mind. That young disciple who certainly would be able to rise up someday\u2026 was he going to get killed that easily and that quickly?Lin Feng had gotten much too excited. He should have controlled himself better.Tong Shou was smiling coldly. He wouldn\u2019t have thought that it would be this easy to kill Lin Feng. What alternative was there? Lin Feng had put himself into this situation. If Lin Feng had known earlier then he wouldn\u2019t have said that blade force was weaker than sword force. Besides, wasn\u2019t the knife much quicker than the sword?Ignorant!Tong Shou could already see Lin Feng\u2019s body being cut into two.The crowd was also already imagining that. Everybody had stopped breathing. They were speechlessly staring at the fighting stage and had the impression that there was nothing on it but a knife and a sword.Finally, the deadly light of the knife vanished. It seemed like time had stopped.Tong Shou\u2019s knife was twenty centimeters above Lin Feng\u2019s head and Lin Feng\u2019s sword was now held at his waist.What was happening? Their two bodies had frozen in that strange position.A small breeze was blowing in the air. Somebody coughed breaking the terrifying silence that had consumed the whole arena.\u201cWho won?\u201dSuddenly, somebody asked the question. It was not clear to them who had won the battle. Everything had been too fast. They didn\u2019t even know where to look.Tong Shou seemed like he was about to speak. Everybody was stupefied. Had he really killed Lin Feng?\u201cHow did you do that?\u201dThe one who asked that question was Tong Shou. It seemed like he couldn\u2019t believe what had just happened.At that moment, Lin Feng spoke slowly and unhurriedly.\u201cBlade force and sword force are the same, they are force. A force is a good way to enhance your attack power as well as other abilities necessary in a battle. A knife has many different uses in life, it is a tool created to aid us. My sword is different, the sword is made for the sole purpose of killing.\u201dLin Feng was standing straight with his head held high. Tong Shou was had blood pouring from his chest. Blood was flowing endlessly from his body onto the ground. Everybody was just staring at the amount blood in shock.\u201cI understand\u2026\u2026\u201d said Tong Shou while his eyes slowly closed themselves. Then, his body also slowly collapsed onto the ground.Immediately after the crowd could not believe their eyes. Lin Feng had thrown the body into the crowd of disciples. He refused to let it remain on the stage in disgrace.Tong Shou had lost, another genius had been killed by Lin Feng!\u201cHow terrifying!\u201dEverybody had the impression that they were in a dream when looking at Lin Feng. It was like he had supernatural powers. He was like a death god as he stood on the main stage. It seemed like nobody was able to defeat him. No matter how strong his opponent was, Lin Feng was always stronger.\u201cPheewww\u2026\u201d Nan Gong Ling took a deep breath. He didn\u2019t know what to think though.Another valued genius of the Yun Hai Sect had died and it was only because Lin Feng wanted to prove how powerful he was.Nan Gong Ling did not want to pay that price.But even though Nan Gong Ling regretted losing so many disciples, he still felt gratified to have a disciple such as Lin Feng. He was also happy to see the rise of a real genius.That kind of strength, that kind of power, who could compete with it?He was starting to believe Lin Feng. Lin Feng just needed a little bit more time and nobody could stop him. Even a hundred Mo Xie-like cultivators wouldn\u2019t be able to defeat Lin Feng.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 - Confrontation of GeniusesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLin Feng turned around and looked at the elite disciples once again.\u201cDoes another one of Wen Ren Yan\u2019s delegates wish to come onto the fighting stage and die in his place?\u201dNobody dared to reply, not even those who were above Tong Shou in the ranking list.Tong Shou\u2019s knife was extremely powerful. Even if they wanted to win, they thought it wasn\u2019t worth the risk as they may lose their life in doing so. Once again, Lin Feng had used his sword to strike only once and Tong Shou\u2019 blood had been spilled.What had scared them even more is that they didn\u2019t know if Lin Feng had really shown all his strength. He had only required a single strike which was not enough to measure his power. Each time he would increase the power depending on his opponent.Tong Shou had been killed in a single strike. Exactly how much of his strength was still remaining hidden? He was always stronger than his opponent, how was that possible?Everybody was staring at Wen Ren Yan as if they thought that Wen Ren Yan was the only one who could defeat Lin Feng.\u201cToday\u2019s Elite Disciple Exam could almost be entitled \u201cThe Rise of Lin Feng\u201d\u201dSome people in the crowd were smiling wryly as someone made that comment. The Elite Disciple Exam had gone completely off track. The original purpose was completely forgotten. There was only a single person at the center of their attention. They were focusing on that genius who was named Lin Feng.Almost everybody without exception was intensely staring at Wen Ren Yan. Wen Ren Yan frowned as his face twisted with anger and he looked like a demon with hatred filling his eyes.Lin Feng had been demonstrating extraordinary talent every time he fought. Each time, Lin Feng was surprising everybody even more. Therefore, at that moment, Wen Ren Yan had the feeling that he was being slapped in the face by every single person who was staring at him because he had kept humiliating Lin Feng over and over again calling him a nobody and a piece of trash. His own words had come back to humiliate him in front of the entire sect.At that moment, no other elite disciple would dare to fight against Lin Feng. Only Wen Ren Yan could fight against Lin Feng. However at this point many people were scared that Wen Ren Yan had talked to big and was not Lin Feng\u2019s match.Lin Feng was extremely strong and had hidden his power to such a great degree. He hadn\u2019t talked big and he had not lost face yet. How could anyone call him a nobody or a piece of trash?\u201cWen Ren Yan, are you not supposed to prove to everybody that I am a piece of trash and a nobody now? I think that\u2019s what you should do.\u201d Shouted Lin Feng which broke the silence and echoed throughout the arena.Lin Feng was also staring at Wen Ren Yan and quickly glanced at Han Man who had been injured by Wen Ren Yan. Lin Feng really wanted to kill Wen Ren Yan when he had found out about him injuring Han Man. He had built up a great deal of killing intent just thinking about it.Wen Ren Yan had lied and said to everybody that Liu Fei was his girlfriend. Lin Feng, because Liu Fei had now said that she was his girlfriend, wanted to kill Wen Ren Yan even more. Because of Wen Ren Yan he was once again stuck with Liu Fei.Wen Ren Yan was more arrogant than strong.\u201cSince you are stronger than me, come and kill me, otherwise it means that I am stronger than you and you are just courting death.\u201dLin Feng was secretly had a cold smile in his heart. Wen Ren Yan and Mo Xie were the same. They had to die because of what they had done to him and his friends.If Lin Feng didn\u2019t kill them, whenever they would have an opportunity to kill Lin Feng, they would do so without hesitation.\u201cHow ridiculous. How pathetic.\u201dsaid Wen Ren Yan as he started walking towards the highest central stage of the Life and Death Arena.In the blink of an eye, everybody\u2019s expression changed. They could not hold back their excitement. They couldn\u2019t wait to watch the battle of these two geniuses.Wen Ren Yan was the top ranked elite disciple who could even fight with core disciples. He was ranked first from all the powerful elite disciples. Before Lin Feng appeared, Wen Ren Yan was considered as the junior disciple with the greatest future potential. He was considered as a treasured genius within the sect. Of course, his strength hadn\u2019t reached that of Ling Hu He Shan or Tu Fu.The rise of Lin Feng seemed like it had started. Lin Feng was killing all the arrogant disciples because they had humiliated him or threatened him. The ordinary Elder Lu Yuan\u2019s cultivation would be crippled and he would be expelled from the sect because of Lin Feng. Lin Feng also wanted Mo Xie to be expelled from the sect.These two disciples were considered as outstanding geniuses in the Yun Hai Sect. Who could dare criticize them?\u201cYou think that just because you defeated Lei Bo and Tong Shou, you can compete with me?\u201dWen Ren Yan said with his usual arrogant and aggressive tone and then added: \u201cIf I want to, I can crush you like a bug. You\u2019re just a nobody, an insect, in my eyes. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth fighting against you but you are insisting so much that I have no choice but to prove you how ridiculous your provocations are. How pitiful for you that you are so over confident.\u201d\u201cI will use your death to prove to everyone that my abilities are endless.\u201dHe was arrogant, aggressive and thought he was the best cultivator in the world. However he was indeed strong and respected within the sect.\u201cThe only thing which is endless is your ability to talk shit.\u201d Shouted Wen Ren Yan as he grew even more angry.The more Wen Ren Yan heard Lin Feng talk, the even more hideous his face looked.\u201cAlright.\u201dWhen the two disciples were both on the fighting stage, Nan Gong Ling started talking.\u201cYou are the geniuses of my Sect. The Yun Hai Sect will need you both in the future. You are the successors of those in charge of Yun Hai Sect. Please let\u2019s make this battle an educational one for yourselves and everybody who is present. There will certainly be a lot to learn from your battle. So please, this time, do not fight until the death.\u201dNan Gong Ling thought that Wen Ren Yan and Lin Feng were outstanding geniuses within the Yun Hai Sect. The Yun Hai Sect could be proud to have such disciples. If any of them died then it would be too much of a loss for the Yun Hai Sect.Nan Gong Ling hoped that none of them would die or get severely injured, or to be more precise, he hoped Lin Feng wouldn\u2019t die or be injured.That was because Nan Gong Ling perfectly knew how powerful Wen Ren Yan was. His strength was way too monstrous. Besides, Wen Ren Yan had a very rare spirit which was more powerful than an average spirit.\u201cPatriarch, that piece of trash has been provoking me over and over again. How could I not hate him bitterly for that? This will be his grave.\u201d Said Wen Ren Yan.Nan Gong Ling was unable to convince Wen Ren Yan. Nan Ren Yan definitely wanted to kill Lin Feng. If he didn\u2019t, he wouldn\u2019t be able to prove everyone that he was the true genius of the Yun Hai Sect.Lin Feng was just a nobody and could not be compared with the mighty Wen Ren Yan. This was Wen Ren Yan\u2019s current though process.\u201cLin Feng, please refrain from this fight.\u201dNan Gong Ling couldn\u2019t help but beg Lin Feng to not fight.Lin Feng was slightly smiling and said, while looking at Nan Gong Ling: \u201cIt seems like the Patriarch still isn\u2019t convinced of my abilities, could it be that I have not shown you enough yet?\u201dNan Gong Ling smiled wryly and said while shaking his head: \u201cLin Feng, Wen Ren Yan has broken through to the third Ling Qi layer and has a Blue Bamboo Beast Spirit. Even though you are very strong, you still need more time before you are able to catch up with him.\u201dBlue Bamboo? Blue Bamboo Beast Spirit?Lin Feng eyes shrunk. In his memories, the blue bamboo beast spirit was a sort of snake who was small yet very venomous. It had blue eyes and was as fast as lighting. Besides, it was capable of dodging attacks very efficiently. Its power was horrifying and just the mention of it made many people cower in fear.\u201cThat\u2019s why his eyes look so hideous when he was angry. Sometimes, they look like they\u2019re blue. That comes from his beast spirit.\u201dLin Feng was thinking about Wen Ren Yan\u2019s hideous blue eyes. They really looked like that of a snake and made people feel very uncomfortable when looking at them.But would Lin Feng lose only because Wen Ren Yan had a Blue Bamboo Beast Spirit?\u201cPatriarch, don\u2019t impose restrictions on them. That little brat keeps humiliating my disciple over and over again, he must die. If he doesn\u2019t die then it would make me lose face. Do not put them under any restrictions in this fight.\u201dAt that moment, a cold and high pitched voice spread through the atmosphere. A woman was on the top of the gorge. She had called out as she was slowly descending into the gorge. Her body looked lithe and graceful. In the blink of an eye, she landed onto the viewing platform.\u201cWho is she? Wen Ren Yan is her disciple?\u201dThe crowd was staring at the woman who had just appeared. She looked haggard and the little hair she had on her head was hanging loosely which gave people a gloomy impression. She looked like she had come straight out of a horror story.Besides, she dared to talk to the Patriarch in such a way which meant that she certainly had a high status.There were also a certain number disciples who recognized her. They wouldn\u2019t have expected her to intervene. Things were not looking good for Lin Feng with the arrival of this woman.\u201cTeacher.\u201dEven though Wen Ren Yan was normally extremely haughty and arrogant, he was acting very courteously in front of this woman. He was even more polite to her than to Nan Gong Ling.\u201cHm.\u201d the woman slightly nodded while looking cold and detached. She glanced at Duan Tian Lang and then said to Nan Gong Ling: \u201cPatriarch, we should not get involved in this issue, otherwise, that would make these two disciples lose face.\u201dNan Gong Ling was making a wry smile. He hadn\u2019t thought that this woman would appear there. It seemed like things were getting worse and worse.\u201cOld woman, you come here and tell the Patriarch that he shouldn\u2019t get involved, but what are you doing yourself?\u201dA silhouette which was high the air said as its wings created small whirlpools in the atmosphere.\u201cProtector Bei.\u201dNan Gong Ling was even more surprised with each passing minute. The conflict between Wen Ren Yan and Lin Feng made two of the protectors get involved.\u201cLin Feng, what do you think?\u201d said Protector Bei\u201cI agree to a battle to the death.\u201dLin Feng had obviously understood what Protector Bei meant. If he said he didn\u2019t agree, Protector Bei would protect him. He had to fight in order to settle his grievance.If Wen Ren Yan knew what even one of Lin Feng\u2019s spirits were then he would immediately refuse this battle and escape. Even if he was entirely convinced by his own strength, Lin Feng also had powerful spirits which were much stronger than his own. Lin Feng would not back down from this fight.Protector Bei said: \u201cIf you really want to fight in a battle to death, this is your own decision and I will not intervene but you have to remember that you might regret it later.\u201d\u201cNo need to think about useless things.\u201d Said Lin Feng who shook his head. He was already determined to kill Wen Ren Yan.\u201cOk.\u201d Protector Bei felt gratified and was nodding, he then said: \u201cOnce you have won, I will help you have Mo Xie expelled from the sect.\u201dWhen they heard what Protector Bei had said, the entire crowd was stupefied. Protector Bei was planning to help him expel Mo Xie from the sect? It looked like the old man of the Xing Chen Pavilion was an incredible figure within the sect. Who else could make such a promise to Lin Feng? He was also incredibly sure of Lin Feng\u2019s victory.Mo Xie\u2019 face looked hideous and evil intentions filled his mind. If Lin Feng won this fight then Protector Bei would expel him from the sect, what a bastard!Mo Xie hated Protector Bei so much at that moment. The difference between their statuses within the hierarchy was like heaven and earth, Protector Bei was even higher in status than his Mo Cang Lan. Mo Xie could only hope that Lin Feng would die in the upcoming battle.\u201cOld woman, if Lin Feng is defeated, I will not get involved however if Lin Feng wins, will you get involved?\u201dProtector Bei was looking at the woman as he asked his question.\u201cWhy would I do that? Besides, my disciple will not lose.\u201dThe old woman was looking at Protector Bei with eyes full of confidence in her disciple. Protector Bei was also very proud of Lin Feng and believed that this would be his victory.Protector Bei nodded looking indifferent.\u201cSince it\u2019s like that, you may now fight.\u201d Said the old woman.Nan Gong Ling was smiling wryly. Now that the old woman and Protector Bei had appeared, nobody was listening to him anymore.So, after this battle, there would be only one genius disciple left?Nan Gong Ling was extremely reluctant but what choice did he have?Lin Feng and Wen Ren Yan\u2019s battle was inevitable.Both of them were standing on the fighting stage of the Life and Death Arena. Wen Ren Yan was looking at Lin Feng and said: \u201cI really don\u2019t understand why Protector Bei has any confidence in you. He surprisingly believes that you can defeat me. He will soon find out that he has overestimated your abilities.\u201d\u201cIn front of me, you are just a miserable insect. In front of me, people will think that your abilities are pathetic and miserable. I will prove to everyone that I am the only genius within the Yun Hai Sect.\u201dWhen Wen Ren Yan finished talking, an evil Qi emerged from his body. From his back, a small snake appeared and floated behind him. Even though the snake was only a shadow, people had the impression that it was a real venomous snake. This was Wen Ren Yan\u2019s Blue Bamboo Beast Spirit.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 - The Real ThreatPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe small Blue Bamboo Snake slithered up onto Wen Ren Yan\u2019s body until it finally sat atop his head. Its blue eyes looked incredibly evil.\u201cLin Feng, look into my eyes.\u201dWen Ren Yan was speaking loudly. Lin Feng was staring at Wen Ren Yan\u2019s evil blue eyes. They looked like torrents of lightning. Lin Feng was so absorbed in Wen Ren Yan\u2019s eyes that he was absent minded for a second.Wen Ren Yan had an evil smile on his face. He suddenly moved as fast as lightning and landed in front of Lin Feng in the blink of an eye. He thrust out his hand directly towards Lin Feng\u2019s head.\u201cHow quick!\u201dEverybody was stupefied. Not only did Wen Ren Yan\u2019s eyes look really evil but he was also extremely quick and agile. When Wen Ren Yan released his spirit, his entire body looked like a snake. Looking directly into his eyes for even a few seconds could lead to your death.\u201cThis looks bad.\u201dLin Feng had been absent minded for only a brief moment and had quickly used his sword to block the attack. In the blink of an eye, an extremely powerful energy struck against Lin Feng\u2019s sword and sent him into the air. His soft sword was zigzagging in the air and it looked like he was going to fall heavily on the ground because of Wen Ren Yan\u2019s attack.\u201cMoonlight Feather Agility.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s body started to twist in mid air and he managed to land steadily on both his feet.Wen Ren Yan didn\u2019t even try to come close to Lin Feng. He was still at the same place and said with an evil smile: \u201cYou see the colossal difference? You may be a genius, but in front of me, you are nothing. If I want to play with you, I can play with you. Even if I don\u2019t attack you, my speed alone would make it impossible for you to even touch a hair on my body.\u201d\u201cAs expected, Lin Feng is strong but the difference between Wen Ren Yan is gigantic. Lin Feng is unable to even touch him. Wen Ren Yan is way too powerful. Even the second of the ranking list would be unable to compete with him.\u201dThe crowd was convinced that Lin Feng couldn\u2019t do anything. Wen Ren Yan\u2019s attacks almost couldn\u2019t be blocked. Lin Feng would quickly get discouraged and end up losing his life.Lin Feng\u2019s eyes shrunk. He didn\u2019t dare look at Wen Ren Yan\u2019s blue pupils again.When Wen Ren Yan released his spirit, his eyes were filled with an evil light. If you looked at them even for even a second, you could be paralyzed. Lin Feng hadn\u2019t forgotten what had happened just a moment ago.What the Blue Bamboo Beast spirit allowed Wen Ren Yan to do was extremely frightening. It granted him incredible speed and the ability to paralyze an opponent.It was a wonderful natural ability. Some geniuses had such amazing spirits that they had a clear advantage over many people. Wen Ren Yan was one of those people with an amazing spirit.\u201cCelestial Spirit.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s cold look disappeared and was replaced by a pair of pitch black eyes which looked extremely evil. He gradually became aware of every single movement within the atmosphere as if the world was moving in slow motion. His brain was processing the data at an incredible speed.His sword was diffusing an extremely powerful Qi and sword force was gathering. The entire fighting stage was filled with the power from his sword. The smell of blood was still fresh on the fighting stage, however the sword was emanating an aura of death. It felt like whatever the sword attacked would be cursed to death.\u201cSword force, oh isn\u2019t that terrific?\u201dWen Ren Yan was smiling coldly. He was motionless and suddenly an extremely violent energy spread through the atmosphere and attacked Lin Feng. The energy was being released from Wen Ren Yan\u2019s hand in an attempt to crush Lin Feng. This energy was so strong that it did not compare with Wen Ren Yan\u2019s previous attack.Lin Feng managed to break free while looking as agile as the wind.The energy being released by Wen Ren Yan\u2019s hand was shaking the atmosphere.\u201cPhewww\u2026.\u201dWen Ren Yen took a deep breath and tried to attack Lin Feng again.But it seemed like Lin Feng already knew in advance what attack Wen Ren Yan was attempting and where his attack would target. With graceful and effortless movements, Lin Feng dodged the incoming attack. His body moved like the wind, looking light and agile. It seemed like Lin Feng hadn\u2019t required any effort to dodge the attack.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe crowd was observing Lin Feng with the greatest attention. Lin Feng\u2019s body looked so graceful and agile. Could it be that Lin Feng had learnt and practiced an agility technique to dodge attacks?\u201cWhat kind of agility technique could make him so quick and agile?\u201d\u201cCould it be that it\u2019s not an agility technique and that it\u2019s just an illusion?\u201d\u201cIf Lin Feng is able to create illusions, then that\u2019s really terrifying.\u201dMany people in the crowd were talking about that move Lin Feng had just displayed. Wen Ren Yan who was extremely quick and agile had suddenly been unable to reach Lin Feng. Lin Feng had been able to dodge his attacks very easily.Lin Feng was effortlessly dodging attacks and moving with a calm look on his face. Even though the move he had done a moment before looked like an agility technique, it wasn\u2019t one but his Celestial Spirit allowed him to move without wasted movements. His spirit made him omniscient and aware of everything surrounding him which enabled him to dodge to perfection. Besides with his spirit unleashed, Wen Ren Yan was moving in slow motion for him. Lin Feng also felt more relaxed which made it easy for him to dodge Wen Ren Yan\u2019s attacks with a calm demeanor.\u201cGet lost.\u201d Snorted Lin Feng.Lin Feng\u2019s sword started glowing and he elegantly moved the sword through the air. The force diffused by the sword seemed like it could annihilate anything in its path. Wen Ren Yan immediately jumped back to a safe distance and did not want to approach Lin Feng. They were both moving incredibly quick.\u201cHow can you be so quick?\u201d said Wen Ren Yan, whose evil blue eyes were staring at Lin Feng in shock.\u201cI thought you wanted to play with me, why are you suddenly retreating? I thought I was nothing compared with you, what\u2019s wrong? Why do you keep running away?\u201dLin Feng\u2019s tone was ice cold. Wen Ren Yan\u2019s blue pupils and Lin Feng\u2019s pitch black eyes both looked demonic but at that moment Wen Ren Yan couldn\u2019t help but stare at Lin Feng\u2019s black eyes with a hint of fear.\u201cWhy have his eyes also changed? Could it be that he has a spirit similar to mine?\u201dWen Ren Yan was wondering what was going on while looking at Lin Feng\u2019s eyes. He had noticed that Lin Feng\u2019s eyes had changed. They were ice cold a moment ago but now they seemed expressionless, lifeless and contained endless darkness. In Wen Ren Yan\u2019s opinion, it could only be due to some sort of skill or a spirit. This would be the only thing which could explain Lin Feng\u2019s eye transformation.\u201cSkill or spirit, it doesn\u2019t matter. I will kill you anyway.\u201d Wen Ren Yan thought that deep in his heart. He kept staring at Lin Feng and then said: \u201cLin Feng, look into my eyes.\u201dWen Ren Yan\u2019s normal aggressive and cold look was mixed with his beast like eyes. This time when Lin Feng stared at Wen Ren Yan\u2019s pupils nothing happened. His eyes still looked like two endless black holes.\u201cAs expected, it is a skill. It\u2019s impossible to paralyze him.\u201dWen Ren Yan looked surprised. It seemed like his two blue eyes were going to be useless against Lin Feng.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I was just playing with you. Since you seem so impatient to die, I will help you achieve your goal.\u201dWen Ren Yan raised his head. He held his hand out in front of him. His blue eyes were refracting the light around him. An ash-grey Qi emerged from his palm. The Qi was carrying a deathly stillness and the smell of death filled the entire arena.The Blue Bamboo Snake, apart from being extremely quick when dodging attacks, it was extremely venomous and touching it would be fatal. There was no cultivator who would risk the poison contained within the Blue Bamboo Snake.Wen Ren Yan had used his spirit to practice demonic skills which allowed him to channel the poison of the Blue Bamboo Snake.The venom was as powerful as an average Xuan level attack. It enabled Qi to transform into a venomous Qi. This type of attack was extremely powerful. It was also able to paralyze the opponent from pain. Touching it would lead to death or immense suffering.These kinds of skills were also extremely hard to practice. Only extremely talented geniuses could learn such skills. Besides, they required spirits which could be considered as rare and mysterious. For example, Wen Ren Yan could learn such skills because he had a Blue Bamboo Snake Spirit. His spirit was a perfect combination for these types of skills which enabled him to carry out monstrously powerful attacks.Wen Ren Yan\u2019s silhouette flashed in the atmosphere. His velocity was as quick and agile as before. In the blink of an eye he was already in front of Lin Feng.He then cruelly attacked Lin Feng with his deathly Qi. Lin Feng was surprised by this action. He had been already been touched by the Qi which suddenly made him move much slower than before.However, Lin Feng was still very quick and agile when dodging the attacks. He jumped and his body suddenly looked like it was floating in the air. He suddenly thrust out with his glowing sword.Wen Ren Yan\u2019s movement abilities were also extremely good. He was moving like an extremely fast and agile snake. Suddenly, Lin Feng\u2019s sword made a whistling sound when it passed next to Wen Ren Yan\u2019s body. He had successfully dodged the sword strike from Lin Feng.\u201cNo wonder that Wen Ren Yan is so arrogant. He is indeed extremely strong.\u201dLin Feng was feeling gloomy for a second. Wen Ren Yan\u2019s blue pupils as well as his venom were enough to carry out extremely powerful attacks. Besides, his speed when dodging was also extremely good. He could move his body to dodge attacks like a snake. And finally, his speed remained unchanged. It seemed like Wen Ren Yan had no weakness.If Lin Feng didn\u2019t have his Celestial Spirit, he wouldn\u2019t be able to cope with Wen Ren Yan\u2019s speed of attacks. Because of these things, there was probably no other elite disciple who could compete with Wen Ren Yan. If they fought against him, they would be in quite a terrible situation.\u201cI\u2019ll see how long you can endure this.\u201dWen Ren Yan said that while smiling coldly, he was looking down on Lin Feng more than ever. All of a sudden, an incredible Qi consumed the entire atmosphere.\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d shouted Lin Feng.\u201cDeadly sword.\u201dAn incredible quantity of sword force emerged from the tip of his sword. It also seemed like it illuminated the entire arena with its glow. Wen Ren Yan venomous Qi was progressively being pierced and chopped off into pieces by Lin Feng\u2019s sword force. Lin Feng stopped using his sword force and prepared to use his Sword of Nirvana.\u201cA moment ago you said that you were playing with me. I still have seen how you intend to play with me though. The top ranked elite disciple, a peerless genius? Please stop talking such nonsense when standing before me.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s voice resonated throughout the Stormy Gorge.Wen Ren Yan thought that he was playing with Lin Feng but how was that even possible? Lin Feng hadn\u2019t even been slightly harmed by any of Wen Ren Yan\u2019s attacks. He had been able to easily dodge all of them without taking even a scratch.\u201cStop talking nonsense and you are nothing. You are just pathetic and childish.\u201d Said Wen Ren Yan whose tone was filled with disdain.\u201cStop talking nonsense? Do you not have eyes in that head or do you have no brain? Do you think that you are the only one to possess a spirit?\u201dWhen Lin Feng finished talking, a black shadow appeared behind his back. What stupefied everybody was that within that shadow, there were two pitch black eyes. They looked extremely evil and demonic.\u201cThat is the first time that Lin Feng has released his spirit. It looks like it is extremely powerful.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of spirit is that? I have never such a thing before.\u201dMany people were stupefied when they saw Lin Feng\u2019s spirit. That\u2019s right, Lin Feng hadn\u2019t released his spirit until now. They obviously didn\u2019t know that Lin Feng had actually already released the first layer his Celestial Spirit during the battle however it could not be detected.\u201cOh my\u2026 Is that Lin Feng\u2019s spirit? I remember that everyone said Lin Feng had a small snake spirit and that it was completely useless. Since when does Lin Feng have such a spirit?Someone had sighed while saying that. The crowd quickly glanced at him and then ignored what he had said. It was an ordinary disciple who was extremely weak. He was obviously misinformed.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I remember Lin Feng\u2019s useless and crappy snake spirit. Could it be that Lin Feng has two spirits? Otherwise, how could he have this spirit as well?\u201dAnother ordinary disciple said. Only the ordinary disciple knew that Lin Feng used to be bullied and humiliated by everyone because of his spirit. Almost all the ordinary disciples remembered that he was known to be a piece of trash.It seemed like Lin Feng had become a completely new person. In such a short time, he had progressed become so powerful that he was respected by many of the other disciples.Unfortunately for these ordinary disciples, even though they had said the truth, nobody believed them. They believed that these ordinary disciples were just idiots making up rumours.Dual Spirit? How could it be that simple? Dual spirits were extremely rare. If Lin Feng had a double spirit, considering that he was already a genius then it would mean that he is not a genius but a monster!Many of the ordinary disciples were absolutely fascinated by Lin Fen and had become completely captivated.\u201cWen Ren Yan, I will show you my real power now.\u201d Lin Feng sounded completely emotionless which made everybody shiver with fear.Lin Feng hadn\u2019t been using his full strength at all until now?How strong was he?A black fog emerged from his body and started to cover the fighting stage. Lin Feng\u2019s pitch-black eyes were looking more and more frightening and cruel than ever before.He was holding his sword in his hand out of which was emanating a huge quantity of sword Qi.\u201cCelestial Ability.\u201dWhen Lin Feng said that, a small white light flashed in Lin Feng\u2019s dark pupils. They looked even more dangerous than Wen Ren Yan\u2019s blue eyes.Lin Feng had already released his spirit but it was the first time that he was using spirit ability: Celestial Ability.Wen Ren Yan was somehow paralyzed. Suddenly, Wen Ren Yan\u2019s spirit had appeared in front of his eyes and was using his own skull against him. That was a refraction.Wen Ren Yan had a strange sensation at that moment. He had the impression that, in that darkness, he was running but that his body was not moving at all.\u201cMoonlight Feather Agility.\u201dLin Feng started to step forwards, Lin Feng was extremely fast and he suddenly appeared in front of Wen Ren Yan and thrust out his deadly sword.Wen Ren Yan dodged the attack and retaliated with the poison from the palm of his hand.But at the same time, a black Qi emerged absorbed the poison into the black fog. The sword started to glow again and sword force became extremely thick and powerful.\u201cRetreat!\u201dWen Ren Yan tried to retreat but he found that Lin Feng was closely following him like his own shadow. No matter what he did he could not escape from Lin Feng.The dazzling glow from the deadly sword swallowed the entire atmosphere once again.As Wen Ren Yan retreated he continued to be met with Lin Feng\u2019s sword and it was getting harder and harder to dodge his strikes.Wen Ren Yan gnashed his teeth. He was confused because he could see the glow from the sword attacking him from every angle. No matter where he moved, he would be in danger.What astonished Wen Ren Yan the most though is that Lin Feng was attacking continuously without break. It seemed like he did not have to think about anything and was reacting and attacking instantly.\u201cHow is this possible?\u201dWen Ren Yan was really astonished. How terrifying. It was as if Lin Feng knew exactly what Wen Ren Yan was going to do at any moment. Just a moment before, Lin Feng had actually aimed his strike where Wen Ren Yan was planning to dodge. It seemed like Lin Feng already knew exactly what Wen Ren Yan would do before he did it.Maybe it has something to do with the oppressing force in the atmosphere?Wen Ren Yan\u2019s face looked ghastly pale. Lin Feng\u2019s sword was glowing again ready to attack.Wen Ren Yan was exhausted and felt hopeless. He tried to release more poison but it immediately got absorbed by the strange black fog. It seemed like Lin Feng was able to completely dominate Wen Ren Yan\u2019s strength and abilities.\u201cLin Feng is surprisingly able to put Wen Ren Yan in such a dire situation?\u201dEverybody\u2019s face looked as rigid as wood. It seemed like Wen Ren Yan was no longer at an advantage but was actually in danger. He was just defending himself from attacks. No matter where he dodged, he would be attacked again. Each attack was growing more and more dangerous. It looked like he could be killed at any moment.Was it really Wen Ren Yan who was playing with Lin Feng or the opposite? It more looked like Wen Ren Yan was in serious trouble.Everybody was fascinated by Lin Feng. He was so powerful once he released his spirit. He was a real genius and his power was terrifying. The entire crowd envied his power and his talent.At that moment, they all understood that Lin Feng was hiding another terrifying power. It seemed like he had another horrifying yet sensational power. How frightening! It seemed like Lin Feng was able to block all of Wen Ren Yan\u2019s senses and abilities.\u201cHey, genius! Why are you having such a hard time dodging and continue to spend your time running away?\u201d Lin Feng said these words with an emotionless tone which sent shivers down everyone\u2019s spine.Lin Feng surprisingly looked like he wasn\u2019t tired at all. It almost even looks like he had more energy than at the beginning of the battle as if he had just finished his warm up. The entire crowd was so stupefied that they had mixed feelings: they were both excited and scared of Lin Feng at the same time.Lin Feng\u2019s tone and voice had sounded just like that of Wen Ren Yan before the battle when Wen Ren Yan believed he was just toying with Lin Feng. The crowd was looking at Lin Feng like he was an absolute monster.In the end, who was the true genius?\u201cWen Ren Yan, didn\u2019t you say that there was a huge different between you and me? I believe you said that I\u2019d be unable to reach a hair on your body? Yet now you just keep running away and blocking my attacks. Aren\u2019t you feeling ashamed of yourself by now?\u201dLin Feng unsheathed his sword while saying these words which stabbed deep into Wen Ren Yan\u2019s pride. He was going insane from the humiliation he was suffering.\u201cWen Ren Yan, were you not supposed to prove everybody that you were an amazing genius? Is this how you intend to prove it?\u201dLin Feng did not look like he was going to let Wen Ren Yan off at all. He was humiliating Wen Ren Yan as he continued to attack him endlessly. Wen Ren Yan\u2019s thoughts were getting more and more confused. He was going crazy from the humiliation and Lin Feng continued attacking him over and over again.\u201cYou insult others and call them \u201ca piece of trash\u201d. Well, it seems like you are a piece of trash yourself. Can you feel it? It is called humiliation, but you are a shameless person so I guess that you do not understand how to feel shame.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s words continued to bombard Wen Ren Yan\u2019s pride and arrogance. He stopped dodging attacks and started to gather a large quantity of poison which threw itself straight at Lin Feng while looking like a snake. Wen Ren Yan was finally brave enough to challenge death.\u201cYou should wait until I am done. Then death will come to collect you.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s pitch-black eyes were expressionless. The sword force was getting more and more intense. It was consuming everything within the atmosphere and growing in power.\u201cDeadly sword.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s sword illuminated the atmosphere. It was thrusting towards Wen Ren Yan whose heart was pounding.\u201cRetreat!\u201d A voice shouted from the crowd. Wen Ren Yan, without hesitation, retreated backwards while focusing all of his remaining power on escaping.\u201cDie!\u201dThat word spread throughout the atmosphere and Lin Feng\u2019s deadly sword begun to pierce through the atmosphere annihilating everything in its path.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 - Selected GeniusesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cBOOOM!.\u201dA deadly whistling sound spread throughout the atmosphere. Wen Ren Yan would probably be exterminated in the blink of an eye. Wen Ren Yan\u2019s face turned deathly pale and blood started to drip from his mouth under the pressure. That sword was incredibly powerful.\u201cDisperse!\u201dAt that moment, a strong and pure Qi came from the sky and collided into that deadly sword Qi. The rumbling noise caused by their collision was unceasingly resonating in the entire gorge. Besides, a silhouette had landed in front Lin Feng. It was the old woman who was Wen Ren Yan\u2019s teacher.\u201cIt\u2019s enough. You won.\u201d said the old woman in an indifferent tone yet sounding like she wouldn\u2019t tolerate any resistance.Lin Feng\u2019s pupils shrank. How ridiculous. Was that all? He had won? But Wen Ren Yan could continue behaving like before if he didn\u2019t die.\u201cOld woman, have you forgotten our agreement?\u201d said Protector Bei sounding annoyed.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I haven\u2019t forgotten about it but Wen Ren Yan is my only disciple. Even if I am losing face now, I cannot even bear the thought of losing my only student and seeing him die.\u201dThe old woman\u2019s words deeply moved the crowd. However, she said to Protector Bei that he didn\u2019t have to worry and that she hadn\u2019t forgotten their agreement. She had interrupted Lin Feng and Wen Ren Yan\u2019s battle and had saved Wen Ren Yan. Wasn\u2019t that a bit contradictory?But the whole crowd didn\u2019t pay attention to that. They were still lost in thoughts recalling Lin Feng\u2019s sword a moment before. Lin Feng had definitely defeated Wen Ren Yan, the top ranked elite disciple.At that moment, Lin Feng actually became the strongest of all the elite disciplesNan Gong Ling had already stood up. He was staring blankly at the fighting stage of the Life and Death Arena. He was stupefied but in his heart, he felt extremely gratified by that amazing young disciple.Lin Feng was just amazing.\u201cAlright, the Elite Disciple Exam is over for today. Everybody can leave.\u201dProtector Bei was waving at people. He also didn\u2019t argue with the old woman which surprised a multitude of people.The Elite Disciple Exam was over?Everybody was staring at Nan Gong Ling. Nan gong Ling was staring at Protector Bei who was just nodding.\u201cHehe, brilliant. The Elite Disciple Exam is fascinating. There is no need to finish that early.\u201dAt that moment, Duan Tian Lang said these words while scratching his ear which made Nan Gong Ling frown.\u201cPatriarch, let the crowd disperse. Dissolve the entire sect.\u201dProtector Bei suddenly sounded so solemn. The entire crowd was astonished. Disperse the crowd\u2026 and dissolve the sect?What was going on?Many people in the crowd suddenly had a bad premonition and then Duan Tian Lang\u2019s laughter spread in the atmosphere.\u201cNo need to waste time. Those at the periphery of the mountain are already dead. Nobody can leave. The best option is to stay here.\u201d\u201cDuan Tian Lang, what do you mean?!\u201dNan Gong Ling suddenly seemed extremely strict and firm. He was intensely staring at Duan Tian Lang.\u201cWhat do I mean? Nan Gong Ling, do you think that I have come here only to watch the best Elite Disciples of the Yun Hai Sect fighting at the Elite Disciple Exam? You are way too naive.\u201d said Duan Tian Lang coldly and then said: \u201cI said it already. I came here today because last time, the Yun Hai Sect refused to hand over some of its best disciples. I came here personally as a delegate of His Majesty.\u201d\u201cBoom\u2026.\u201dHis words were detonating in people\u2019s brain. The ground was faintly shaking which stupefied everybody.Besides, it seemed like it was shaking more and more. Not too long after, it seemed like the entire gorge was about to cave in. The noises were becoming louder and louder, more and more intense and were probably covering the entire area of the Yun Hai Sect.\u201cPffffff\u2026.\u201d Protector Bei sighed in a sorrowful way. He realized that these people had actually come to the Yun Hai Sect with harmful intentions.The ground kept shaking and a huge cloud of dust was rising up in the air. At that moment, the crowd looked up in the air and saw a great number of Chi Xie armored cavalry at the top of the gorge. They were carrying bows on their back and looked like they were ready to attack at any moment.\u201cChi Xie armored cavalry.\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s eyes shrank. How come the armored cavalry were suddenly surrounding the area?Lin Feng glanced at the armored cavalry and then glanced at Liu Fei but at that moment Liu Fei seemed as surprised as him.What was going on? What had happened?Liu Fei also glanced at Lin Feng. These were her father\u2019s personal army and they were surprisingly surrounding her father\u2019s sect.\u201cCould it be that my father gave them orders himself? Is it even possible? Liu Fei was thinking and looked extremely perplexed. She thought that it would be ridiculous. Nobody could understand her father better than her\u2026 and her father would have never ordered such a thing.What was going on?\u201cDuan\u2026 Tian\u2026 Lang\u2026\u201d Nan Gong Ling looked enraged and furious. His eyes, filled with murderous intentions, were fixedly staring at Duan Tian Lang.\u201cNan Gong Ling, no need to stare at me like this. These Chi Xie armored cavalry are your dear friend\u2019s, Liu Cang Lan\u2019s, personal army. If there is a problem, talk to him, not to me.\u201dDuan Tian Lang was smiling evilly.The ground was still shaking. In an instant, the top of the Stormy Gorge was full of Chi Xie armored cavalry. There were so many of them that not a drop of water could trickle through.The Stormy Gorge was completely surrounded by Chi Xie armored cavalry and the situation really looked critical and dangerous.Many disciples of the Yun Hai Sect were scared and shaking. What did these people want to do?In the Stormy Gorge, around the Life and Death Arena, the beginning of a great turmoil was about to happen.Wen Ren Yan was in a dire situation as blood dripped from the side of his mouth. He was injured from that strike and if this battle continued then he would surely lose his life. However events had unfolded to his advantage.Suddenly Duan Tian Lang started to move down from the viewing platform. All eyes fell onto him as he slowly stepped down.Chu Qing, who was next to him, looked at him anxiously. He surprisingly was moving towards the fighting stage of the Life and Death Arena.He was extremely powerful. It seemed like each of his steps made the entire atmosphere vibrate. He was slowly moving towards the Life and Death Arena and then stepped on the highest fighting stage.He was walking slowly as if he was having a peaceful walk in a flower garden.\u201cPeople of the Yun Hai Sect, please listen.\u201dDuan Tian Lang glanced at everybody and said in a loud voice: \u201cI, Duan Tian Lang, represent His Majesty. My duty is to select some outstanding disciples who will join the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue. However, your Patriarch has refused to help his Majesty\u2019s aim. These days, His Majesty is furious and wants the Yun Hai Sect to disappear.\u201dDuan Tian Lang\u2019s harsh words penetrated into everybody\u2019s soul. He wanted the Yun Hai Sect to disappear from the Xue Yue Country?How could he make such a powerful sect as the Yun Hai Sect disappear? There was only one solution\u2026 exterminate everybody within the sect.These people wanted to exterminate every single member of the Yun Hai Sect!!Everybody was panic stricken. The Yun Hai Sect members had joined the sect for the sake of cultivation to become stronger. Being killed for no reason would be an injustice.\u201cHowever, His Majesty is willing to show mercy. He\u2019s giving a chance to every single one of you, ordinary disciple, elite disciples as well as core disciples, whose names are on the ranking lists to accept our offer and leave the Yun Hai Sect to join the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue. The others will not be required.\u201dDuan Tian Lang\u2019s words detonated in everybody\u2019s brain. The crowd felt numb after hearing these words.Leave the Yun Hai Sect? Only those who were ranked disciples?Those who were not ranked felt frustrated in their own lack of power. They wouldn\u2019t have the chance to enjoy the best weapons and skills. They may even die here because of the sect they had chosen.Nan Gong Ling, who was sitting on the viewing platform didn\u2019t look happy to hear this announcement. They wanted to exterminate his beloved Yun Hai Sect? Did he hear them correctly?The Yun Hai Sect had already been existing for a thousand years. It had gone through many great crises but probably never as serious as the current situation. These were earth shattering events for the sect.The Hao Yue Sect, the Ice and Snow Mountain Village, the Mo Shou Sect as well as Duan Tian Lang had come to the Yun Hai Sect to completely wipe its roots from the Xue Yue Country.Obviously, all of this originated from the Imperial clan. They were the ones who had assigned Duan Tian Lang to carry out these tasks. The Yun Hai Sect had become the Imperial Clan\u2019s prey.\u201cWhy choose our sect, the Yun Hai Sect?\u201dNan Gong Ling sounded cold as ever. He was intensely and fixedly staring at Duan Tian Lang wishing he could tear apart his flesh and bones. Would the Yun Hai Sect disappear under Nan Gong Ling\u2019s reign?\u201cNan Gong Ling, you really don\u2019t understand?\u201d said Duan Tian Lang while smiling coldly.\u201cIf you say that this is because I offended your son, I will not believe it. I think that even you wouldn\u2019t believe it. The Hao Yue Sect, the Ice and Snow Mountain Village\u2026 you all came for such a stupid and absurd reason.\u201dNan Gong Ling glanced at Chu Qing and Han Xue Tian and met their gazes.\u201cHehe, you\u2019re right. The Hao Yue Sect also refused the request at the beginning but I told them that I would make the entire Yun Hai Sect join me or be destroyed. Then, they immediately accepted.\u201dDuan Tian Lang\u2019s stupefied everybody in the crowd. Make the entire Yun Hai Sect join him or be destroyed?\u201cI knew it.\u201d said Nan Gong Ling with a sad smile on his face. When all these people had come, Nan Gong Ling had tried to guess why Chu Qing would also come along.\u201cThen, why the Yun Hai Sect? It\u2019s easy to guess, because the Yun Hai Sect is the weakest and the easiest to defeat from all of the great powers. You just have to let some of your best disciples of the sect leave to join me then I may show mercy upon your sect.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a liar.\u201dA soft voice said spread in the air. It came from a lithe and graceful silhouette in the crowd which was slowly moving towards the fighting stage of the Life and Death Arena. Her facial expression revealed intense and bitter hatred.\u201cDuan Tian Lang, you\u2019re lying.\u201dLiu Fei\u2019s beautiful cheeks suddenly seemed very pale. She was filled with anger and indignation.\u201cIf you chose the Yun Hai Sect, Duan Tian Lang, it\u2019s because you are jealous of my father. You envy him. You envy his strength and talent. That is why you chose the Yun Hai Sect and plotted against it. You lied and made the Chi Xue armored horses come with me beforehand. All of this is because you want my father to suffer because you are jealous that you can never be his match.\u201dLiu Fei was filled with hatred and then she added coldly: \u201cDuan Tian Lang, you are shameless. You\u2019re disgusting.\u201dMany people were astonished when they heard Liu Fei\u2019s words. In the Yun Hai Sect, nobody knew exactly what Liu Fei\u2019s status really was or who her father was. From what Liu Fei was saying, it seemed that her father had a really high position within the country, especially if amazing and famous cultivators such as Duan Tian Lang envied him.Besides, what were the Chi Xue armored horses? They were the private troops of Liu Fei\u2019s father?\u201cThe Divine Arrow, Liu Cang Lan.\u201dMany people said that together. In the Xue Yue Country, it was said that there was a man even more glorious and famous than Duan Tian Lang. That man could only be Liu Cang Lan and his divine arrow.At some point, Liu Cang Lan was the leader of a huge army composed of thousands of cultivators and they had saved a city from destruction. They had killed tens of thousands of enemy troops.An arrow on his back, one man\u2026 he had led an entire army on his own. He had killed a huge amount of enemy soldiers and when he had come back, he was covered with blood and fell into a coma.The divine arrow was a symbol of the Xue Yue Country. Besides, the Chi Xue armored horses made enemies panic stricken and terrified.What made everybody proud was that Liu Cang Lan was a member of the Yun Hai Sect and even though he had been helping the Imperial Clan, he had always been loyal to the Yun Hai Sect and had always been proud of being one of its members.Liu Fei\u2019s family name was Liu. Many people would adore her even more for that.\u201cFei Fei, how can you even possibly think that way of Uncle Duan Tian Lang? Your father and I are bosom friends. We\u2019re like brothers. How could I be jealous of him?\u201dDuan Tian Lang was shaking his head and smiling. He was looking at Liu Fei with eyes full of affection. That made everyone feel even more scared.Liu Fei\u2019s father and he were bosom friends? Nan Gong Ling thought that Duan Tian Lang was being extremely treacherous. It made him want to vomit.\u201cYou and my father are bosom friends, like brothers? Yet you want to exterminate the Yun Hai Sect and all of my father\u2019s friends and fellow members?\u201dLiu Fei\u2019s eyes, which were filled with disgust, were staring deeply at Duan Tian Lang.\u201cFei Fei, that is what His Majesty wants. If I exterminate the Yun Hai Sect, it will be only because His Majesty has ordered it. This is nothing personal. The Yun Hai Sect of today is not the Yun Hai Sect of tomorrow. What it wants to do now would just be hindering some disciples\u2019 progress, especially the geniuses. Leaving would be a great opportunity for them to learn and benefit from the best resources available.\u201cBesides, I firmly believe that they will all be pleased. If you don\u2019t believe me, just come and look.\u201dDuan Tian Lang had a smile on the corner of his mouth. He turned around and look at the entire crowd. His facial expression became ice cold.\u201cWhat I said was all true. Ranked disciples, who are willing to leave the Yun Hai Sect, please immediately move over there to the Chi Xue armored horses. Please remember that you don\u2019t have much time.\u201dThe entire crowd suddenly became very agitated.A lot of people were looking at Nan Gong Ling and the Elders of the sect.\u201cThose who are willing to leave, please go already. Don\u2019t stay within my Yun Hai Sect.\u201dProtector Bei had suddenly said that while waving his hand.\u201cProtector Bei.\u201dNan Gong Ling was looking at Protector Bei as if he couldn\u2019t understand what the old man meant.\u201cPatriarch, this is their own decision.\u201dProtector Bei looked sad as if his heart was broken. It was hard to abandon ranked disciples. They were all extremely talented. Besides, someday, they were likely to rise to even greater heights. What a pity!\u201cAlright.\u201d said Nan Gong Ling who knew how sad Protector Bei felt. Therefore, he didn\u2019t refute and then nodded.\u201cThank you Patriarch and Elders of the sect.\u201dMany people, when they saw Nan Gong Ling nod, started moving towards the Chi Xue armored horses.In the blink of an eye, hundreds of disciples were moving towards the Chi Xue armored horses. Besides, the number of disciples moving towards the horses was way above the number of actually existing ranked disciples. Many unranked disciples were trying to pass themselves as one of the ranked disciples of the Yun Hai Sect.\u201cStop there.\u201d Duan Tian lang had a big smile on his face.\u201cFei Fei, you see? These people understand that I\u2019m giving them a great opportunity and they cherish and appreciate it. Therefore, they are happy to leave the Yun Hai Sect for something better.\u201dNan Gong Ling looked sad. He had the feeling that he was being abandoned by too many people.\u201cLin Feng, you were right. When Yun Hai Sect\u2019s disciples are weak, they are not treated well enough. We don\u2019t attach enough importance to them. Only when they become strong enough, we attach enough importance to them, for the glory of the sect.\u201dNan Gong Ling was staring at Lin Feng. His voice was filled with sorrow. He hadn\u2019t realized these things until he saw all these disciples willing to leave. His heart was broken after watching all of the disciples who had wanted to leave.Hard times were the best moment to see who would remain loyal to the sect and who would attach no importance to it at all.\u201cUnfortunately, I found that out too late. If I had found that out ten years earlier, maybe things would have been different. I would already have accomplished great things like Liu Cang Lan.\u201dAt that moment, Lin Feng was expressionless. He also wouldn\u2019t have thought that things would turn out this way.However, Lin Feng admired Nan Gong Ling. Nan Gong Ling cared about the Yun Hai Sect more than himself.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If he wishes to go to the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue then we would welcome him with open arms.\u201dDuan Tian Lang was looking at Nan Gong Ling and Lin Feng. He knew that Lin Feng was a real genius. In comparison to all of the other disciples of the Hao Yue Sect and the Yun Hai Sect, Lin Feng definitely stood at the top. He was such a talented disciple that he had to go to the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue.Of course, there was still Wen Ren Yan as well. Even though he had been defeated by Lin Feng, he was still extremely strong and his fighting style was indeed lethal. If Lin Feng hadn\u2019t been there then Wen Ren Yan would have been the most outstanding disciple of the Yun Hai Sect.\u201cEven if they destroy the Yun Hai Sect, they will never kill Lin Feng. He\u2019s way too important. He\u2019s a unique genius which is only seen once.\u201d\u201cLin Feng has a bright future with endless possibilities.\u201dEverybody was amazed by Lin Feng\u2019s talent and envied him. What did they have to do to be as respected by others as Lin Feng?Besides, it really seemed like the situation was as Lin Feng had described. In the Yun Hai Sect, those who were weak were bullied and threatened. So the Yun Hai Sect had nothing to offer to those whose strength hasn\u2019t manifested itself yet.\u201cYou two, you just have agree to my terms and the doors of the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue will open themselves for you. There is no need to repeat myself, but statement that the training conditions will be much better than in the Yun Hai Sect is a fact.\u201dDuan Tian Lang was looking directly at Lin Feng and Wen Ren Yan.\u201cThat Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue again\u2026\u201dLin Feng thought about the fact that Liu Fei had already solicited him a few times and wanted him to join the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue but he still hadn\u2019t given his reply.He wouldn\u2019t have thought that somebody would ask him to go there again and in such a short period of time. He definitely never thought it would be under these conditions.Wen Ren Yan looked rigid, he then glanced at the old woman who was standing on his side and then at Duan Tian Lang. He had a evil smile on his face.\u201cMy teacher is great and the Yun Hai Sect respects me\u2026 would it be right for me to leave?\u201d Thought Wen Ren Yan.The old woman had prevented Lin Feng from killing Wen Ren Yan. Wen Ren Yan could finally repay all of the things she had done for him.\u201cWen Ren Yan is extremely strong and there is no doubt to his talent. Staying here would just be a waste of his talent. He should definitely go.\u201d\u201cEven though he was defeated by Lin Feng, there is nothing to be ashamed when comparing such geniuses.\u201dThe whole crowd was looking at Wen Ren Yan who was furiously looking at Duan Tian Lang.\u201cThe history of the Yun Hai Sect dates back a thousand years and you want to destroy it in the blink of an eye. How tragic, how pitiful! The Yun Hai Sect\u2026\u2026..\u201dWhile saying this, Wen Ren Yan had released his Blue Bamboo Beast Spirit.At full speed, he launched himself at Duan Tian Lang while shouting loudly.\u201cThe Yun Hai Sect\u2019s will live on through me. I will become stronger than anyone within the sect has before!\u201dWhen he finished his sentence, Wen Ren Yan had already landed next to Duan Tian Lang while looking as evil as always.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe entire crowd was surprised. They didn\u2019t know what Wen Ren Yan was doing and they only saw an evil look in his eyes. He was going to betray the sect and join the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue.\u201cWhat a shameless person!\u201d\u201cHe really doesn\u2019t care about losing face. How can the sect create such disgusting and shameless person?\u201dMany disciples and elders were cursing at him.\u201cHaha\u2026.\u201d Duan Tian Lang paused and then said while smiling: \u201cA wise man submits to circumstances. Wen Ren Yan, do not worry because in the future you will never be forced into such a sorry state.\u201d\u201cEvil little monster!!!\u201dThe old woman looked furious and released an extremely cold Qi and then she rushed towards Wen Ren Yan.At the moment when the old woman was passing next to Duan Tian Lang, he swung down towards her using his gigantic sword.A loud thunderous impact spread through the Life and Death Arena. The body of the old woman was thrown back to where she was initially standing and she couldn\u2019t help but feel a sensation of fear fill her heart.\u201cTeacher, don\u2019t worry. In the future, I will become much stronger than you ever could. I will never disappoint you.\u201dWen Ren Yan was looking at his teacher with eyes filled with arrogance. The old woman who was forcefully repressing her injuries could not help but spit out a mouthful of blood after hearing these words. It had been a long time since she had seen the sight of her own blood.\u201cDon\u2019t be impatient.\u201dDuan Tian Lang was staring at the old woman while watching her movements closely and then looked at Lin Feng and said: \u201cWhat about you? Will you accept my offer like Wen Ren Yan? The Yun Hai Sect has made you suffer greatly, is there even any reason for you to give it face?\u201dLin Feng looked at Duan Tian Land with a calm look as if everything that had happened did not affect him in any way. It was impossible to remove the serenity covering Lin Feng\u2019s face.Everybody in the crowd was staring at Lin Feng while impatient to hear his answer.\u201cLin Feng, he\u2019s right. The Yun Hai Sect has made you suffer so much. You should go with him. I will not try to prevent you from leaving. Nobody in the Yun Hai Sect will blame you for leaving after everything that has happened.\u201dNan Gong Ling had spoken these words as he stood motionless on the viewing platform. Wen Ren Yan had accepted so it would be normal for Lin Feng. Wen Ren Yan had been treated completely differently to Lin Feng. He had received a lot of attention from the sect at the beginning. He had been protected, admired and respected by all of the elders. He had also become the direct disciple of a powerful teacher.Lin Feng was different. He owed nothing to the Yun Hai Sect. Nan Gong Ling hoped from the bottom of his heart that Lin Feng would stay but he also could blame him if he wanted to leave\u2026 because he had no reason to stay.Even if Lin Feng accepted Duan Tian Lang\u2019s proposition, Nan Gong Ling wouldn\u2019t blame him but he would definitely be depressed..\u201cYou are asking Wen Ren Yan and me at the same time, do you think that I would reply positively knowing that he might go as well?\u201d said Lin Feng with a cold tone. Lin Feng\u2019s reply stupefied Wen Ren Yan. Wen Ren Yan could not suppress the hatred which had appeared on his face when he heard the words from Lin Feng\u2019s mouth.\u201cIn this world, enemies cannot be enemies forever. Even if you hate him, I will give you both the same chance to join the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue and the possibility to advance your cultivation in such an amazing environment, where you will receive the best resources. In few years, you can kill him if that is your wish. I will stay out of personal grudges. All that matters is if you have the strength to achieve your goal.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d said Lin Feng while shaking his head: \u201cIf you have me then you don\u2019t have him, if you have him then you don\u2019t have me.\u201dLin Feng was strict with his words which made Duan Tian Lang frown.\u201cWhat do you want then?\u201d said Duan Tian Lang.\u201cI want to kill him, right now.\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s ruthless words had surprised Wen Ren Yan\u2026 that bastard\u2026\u201cAre there no other solutions?\u201d asked Duan Tian Lang.\u201cNo other solution will ease my anger. This is the only option.\u201d replied Lin Feng.Duan Tian Lang was surprised and after a small moment said: \u201cAlright. But first, you have to promise that you will join us. Once you have joined our side and agreed to my offer then I will kill him where he stands.\u201d\u201cBOOM.\u201d Wen Ren Yan had the impression that a bomb had detonated in his brain. Lin Feng just had to agree for Duan Tian Lang\u2026.. to kill him?He was betraying the sect which had nurtured him and what was going to happen in the end?! How ridiculous.Everybody watching felt a cold shiver run down their spines. Surprisingly, Duan Tian Lang attached so much importance to Lin Feng that he suddenly was ready to kill Wen Ren Yan to make Lin Feng join them.It looked like Wen Ren Yan was going to die a miserable death.\u201cNo. You must kill him first.\u201d replied Lin Feng shaking his head as firm as before.\u201cIf I kill him, will you go back on your promise?\u201d said Duan Tian Lang while shaking his head as well: \u201cAre you trying to use me?\u201dLin Feng smiled when he heard Duan Tian Lang\u2019s words: \u201cYou are very smart but you are also very heartless. You are good at manipulating others to your will, I don\u2019t like those types of people.\u201d\u201cSo do you mean that you are refusing my offer?\u201d said Duan Tian Lang in a slightly angry tone.\u201cIndeed.\u201d Said Lin Feng as he indifferently nodded which made everyone watching astonished.Lin Feng had surprisingly refused to go to the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue. He had even tried to trick Duan Tian Lang into killing Wen Ren Yan.Everybody was looking at Lin Feng with a perplexed expression. Nobody understood why Lin Feng would act in such a way.\u201cWen Ren Yan, did you see? You are a piece of trash. When you are not needed anymore, nobody will hesitate to throw you away. Even if you stay alive, you are doomed to forever live in my shadow.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s words were like sharp blades which cut Wen Ren Yan\u2019s pride into tiny little pieces. His arrogance and pride had just been crushed, he would never forget this moment.That\u2019s right. Lin Feng just had to nod once and Wen Ren Yan would be killed. How laughable was his situation.\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d said Duan Tian Lang who was now in a bad mood after being used. Staring at Lin Feng, he said: \u201cI admire your courage but could you give me your reason for refusing my offer?\u201dDuan Tian Lang thought that Lin Feng hated the Yun Hai Sect because of everything that he had said. He could easily kill Wen Ren Yan at any time if it would convince Lin Feng to join them.\u201cEven though the Yun Hai Sect itself doesn\u2019t mean much to me, I have a debt of gratitude owed for Protector Bei\u2019s recognition and appreciation. He cares about me deeply and has continued to protect me. Besides, in the Yun Hai Sect, I have friends who are like brothers to me. How could I ever abandon them for worldly items?\u201dLin Feng still had a very calm look on his face. He then added with an indifferent tone: \u201cI, Lin Feng, have my own talents and my loyalty cannot be bought.\u201dHis voice wasn\u2019t loud but everybody heard and understood him clearly.\u201cProtector Bei cares about me.\u201d\u201cHow could I ever abandon them for worldly items?\u201dThese were sentences that the entire crowd of disciples would never forget just like the sound which came from the drums on the Precipice of Zhangu. This would be something which they would never forget in their lifetime.Although they sounded like simple words, it was not something that just anyone could have said under these circumstances.At that moment, many people thought of Protector Bei and realized how important he was to the sect.Protector Bei was really proud of two things in his life. The first one was that he had accepted Liu Cang Lan as his student and the second was Lin Feng.That young disciple\u2019s words had profoundly touched him.\u201cProtector Bei, you don\u2019t make mistakes. I have eyes but I did not recognise Mt. Tai and now I realize that we have such a wonderful disciple within the sect.\u201dNan Gong Ling could not help but praise Protector Bei and scold himself.The old woman was also looking at Protector Bei and said: \u201cYou have a much better eye than I do. I\u2019ll remember our agreement.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d said Protector Bei while nodding which made a bunch of people curious. They were all wondering what these two protectors were talking about. People could hear about their agreement but still didn\u2019t know what they were talking about.At that moment, Duan Tian Lang had a furious look on his face.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 - Cold BloodedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHehe, to be honest, I am surprised by your decision.\u201dDuan Tian Lang had a cold smile on the corner of his mouth as he stared at Lin Feng.\u201cYou are a genius. I really appreciate your talent and battle ability. I offered you a great opportunity but you are not willing to seize it. It is very important for you to understand that because you are a genius, you will not be treated like other people who refuse this opportunity, if you refuse, I will have no choice but to act rashly. I will not let you off and I will not be able to let you continue living.\u201d\u201cIf you refuse, you are doomed.\u201dDuan Tian Lang suddenly filled with killing intent as a strong Qi was released and shot towards Lin Feng.Lin Feng\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change from his usual calm expression. He obviously understood what Duan Tian Lang meant but he had already understood the consequences of his choices. Some decisions in life needed to be chosen carefully as it could lead a person to their own death.\u201cDuan Tian Lang, I will not allow you to touch him.\u201dAt that moment, Liu Fei suddenly jumped in front of Lin Feng to prevent Duan Tian Lang from attacking Lin Feng. She looked extremely furious at his actions.She had always thought that Lin Feng was a pervert with hidden intentions. She hadn\u2019t thought that Lin Feng could say such touching and moving things while his life was at stake. He had now shown his true character. Everything he had said so far had deeply moved Liu Fei. She had discovered a new aspect of his personality that she had never noticed before.Lin Feng was such a great talent that he couldn\u2019t die. It would be such a pity if he died here under these circumstances.At that moment, the situation was critical for the Yun Hai Sect. Liu Fei was using her own life to stand up for the sect and protect it. She had hope that she could avoid the worst possible outcome.\u201cFei Fei, he must die.\u201dDuan Tian Lang sounded really firm in his resolution.\u201cI will not allow you to touch him.\u201d said Liu Fei as she grew more and more furious. She stared at Duan Tian Lang with evil eyes.\u201cFei Fei, why do you care so much about him? What does he mean to you?\u201d Duan Tian Lang\u2019s son, Duan Han, was staring at Lin Feng. He had recognized him from their earlier encounter. On the day which he came to the Yun Hai Sect with Chi Xie armored cavalry, they had stopped because Liu Fei knew him. However she had said they were only fellow disciples of the same sect and nothing more.But at that moment, Liu Fei was protecting Lin Feng with her life. Duan Han was troubled. He was a genius and had always hoped that Liu Fei would become his wife.\u201cOur relationship is none of your business.\u201d Liu Fei said while intensely staring at Duan Han. Then she glanced at all the Chi Xie armored cavalry and sighed: \u201cYou should all listen to me, I don\u2019t care about who you are, your status, or even whose orders you are acting upon. I will not allow you to touch him, otherwise I will inform my father and his army will come to take care of you.\u201dDuan Han\u2019s face looked extremely ugly at that moment. He then said in an extremely cold tone: \u201cFei Fei, do you like this young man?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d said Liu Fei furiously. Whom she liked was none of Duan Han\u2019s business.Duan Han was stupefied. His expression changed from shock to a face which resembled an evil demon. He then said in an ice cold tone: \u201cAlright. Alright\u2026 Now there is a second reason for him to die\u201d\u201cLin Feng, you\u2019re always saying long and righteous words, what the hell are you doing now hiding behind that girl?\u201dLin Feng was smiling wryly\u2026 Liu Fei was always protecting him.Lin Feng moved in front of Liu Fei, took her hand and whispered: \u201cYou\u2019re my girlfriend, how could I let you protect me?\u201d\u201cHmphh\u2026\u201dLiu Fei looked embarrassed but a smile had appeared on her face. That bastard, when had he learnt to be a gentleman?But Duan Han\u2019s face became even uglier as he shouted: \u201cYour girlfriend?! What gives you the right to say that Liu Fei is your girlfriend? Lin Feng, do you dare to come and fight with me!\u201d\u201cLin Feng, don\u2019t!\u201d Said Liu Fei with a hint of worry.Liu Fei pulled on Lin Feng\u2019s sleeve to stop him. She clearly know how strong Duan Han was. His power was even more frightening that that of Wen Ren Yan. His sword was infinitely more powerful than what Lin Feng had displayed earlier.But\u2026 How could Lin Feng retreat now?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you dare?\u201d Laughed Duan Han.Lin Feng moved towards Duan Han. Duan Han was about eighteen years old. Even if he was extremely strong, there was no reason for Lin Feng not to be able to fight against him.\u201cHmph, alright.\u201d Snorted Duan Han.He had an evil covering his face. As he held his sword a great quantity of sword Qi emerged and was released in the atmosphere.That sword Qi was getting more and more intense while it violently whistled through the atmosphere. Slowly it started to gather another power.\u201cSword force.\u201dThe entire crowd was stupefied. That was sword force which he was using. Duan Tian Lang\u2019s son, Duan Han, was using the same force as Lin Feng. The sword force he was releasing was cutting through the atmosphere and filling the entire arena. The Qi from his sword was even stronger than that of Lin Feng but Lin Feng\u2019s sword force was much more powerful than that of Duan Han.Lin Feng was surprised. He unsheathed his sword and just like Duan Han, he released his sword force.\u201cTsk, a sword master doesn\u2019t necessarily need to use his sword, pay attention.\u201d Said Duan Han.Suddenly, Duan Han moved his hand and it seemed like his sword Qi was suddenly mixing with the Qi contained within the earth and the heavens. His sword was glowing as Qi qould circulate in and out of his sword.The crowd was stupefied. It looked like pure Qi was being released from his sword. How could Duan Han be so monstrously powerful?It had to be a skill, an extremely strong and powerful skill.\u201cSword.\u201dDuan Han shouted loudly. An extremely powerful yet pure Qi was emerging out from the palm of his hand while emitting a radiant light.The sword Qi in the air took the shape of a sword and looked like it was aiming directly at Lin Feng.At that moment, all the sword Qi and Sword force had combined, and was starting to pressure Lin Feng\u2019s body.The energy sword thrust itself towards Lin Feng at incredible speed.Lin Feng could dodge but had to be careful as by dodging the sword created from energy he would be open to other attacks.Duan Han was a genius sword master. He had learnt and practiced many sword skills. Lin Feng had no choice but to recognize that Duan Han was a sword master. Lin Feng didn\u2019t think that way about all the sword users he had met before, even if they had a sword spirit, however Duan Han was different.\u201cDeadly sword.\u201dWhen Lin Feng saw all the combined sword energy, he grabbed his long sword and released an incredible amount of Qi to block the incoming energy sword.An incredibly huge amount of sword Qi started to cover the entire arena. However, it seemed like Lin Feng\u2019s sword Qi was unable to compete with the sword energy which was released by Duan Han.\u201cHow powerful!\u201d His pupils started to dilate. At that moment, he could already feel the sword energy released by Duan Han growing closer which suddenly made Lin Feng feel imminent danger. He could not help but groan as he was in a dangerous situation.But the most terrifying thing was the sword energy which continued to thrust at Lin Feng.\u201cBOOOM!!\u201dLin Feng was projected back several steps and blood started to drip from the corner of his mouth. A bright red blood was dripping down his chin.Lin Feng\u2019s robes were ragged and his body was riddled with wounds.Liu Fei who wasn\u2019t far behind him ran straight towards him and offered her hand to help him stand.\u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201d said Lin Feng indifferently while shaking his head. All the sword Qi and sword force started to combine into another energy sword. Even though Lin Feng was defeated, he would still remain brave until the end.\u201cHow Powerful!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not that much older than Wen Ren Yan but he\u2019s much stronger!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s another genius, a genius sword master!\u201dThe crowd was thinking all sorts of things. A sword master was extremely powerful, much more than expected.\u201cDo you see now? You cannot even withstand a single attack. We have nothing in common. You will forever be chasing my footprints.\u201dDuan Han was staring at Lin Feng and looked extremely cold. He then raised his hand and shouted: \u201cRAISE YOUR BOWS!\u201d\u201cHahhhhh!!!\u201dThe loud shout spread throughout the entire atmosphere of the gorge and then all the cavalry mounted on their Chi Xie armored horses raised their bows. They had filled the cliff at the top of the gorge completely.A terrifying Qi filled the air above the Life and Death Arena.\u201cI just have to speak once and everybody will fire their bows. They will kill anyone with just a single word from me. How could you even think that you can compete with me?\u201d\u201cYou may lower your bows\u201d Duan Han had told them to lower their bows and all the cavalry instantly lowered their bows.\u201cYour strength and my strength are not even comparable. You cannot master forces to the same level as me. What makes you think that you can be intimate with Liu Fei when I cannot?\u201dDuan Han said with an ice cold tone.\u201cDuan Han, you are a shameless asshole!\u201d shouted Liu Fei furiously cursing at Duan Han.\u201cIf you are so strong now, it is because of the clan in which you grew up, which descends from the Imperial family. You don\u2019t know what it is to lack great teachers and resources. Why are you doing this to Lin Feng? Besides, Lin Feng is an expert at learning martial skills and agility techniques. Haven\u2019t you noticed that his skills have the power of highest quality Xuan Level skills? He has gained everything by relying on his own power. Are you not ashamed to show off the power you gained from your clan in front of Lin Feng?\u201d\u201cAll you have learnt and all the power you have is because your family and because you have a high status. You have never had to rely on your talent, do you even have any?\u201d\u201cYou cannot deny, however, that I perfectly master all of these skills. You cannot deny that I am now an extremely strong cultivator. Lin Feng and I really have nothing in common.\u201d said Duan Han disagreeing with Liu Fei.\u201cEven if that\u2019s the case, what\u2019s your problem? Don\u2019t forget that you are older than Lin Feng as well. In two years, he will be much stronger than you. You are pathetic and shameless.\u201dLiu Fei was shouting and everyone was nodding in agreement with what she was saying.That\u2019s right. Everything that Liu Fei said to Duan Han was actually justified.Because Duan Han came from such a powerful family and had such a high status that didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t gifted or couldn\u2019t use forces properly. However was he more gifted than Lin Feng?Lin Feng\u2019s background wasn\u2019t as good as Duan Han\u2019s. Lin Feng could only rely on himself to gain his power. If Lin Feng switched places with Duan Han, he would probably be many times stronger than him. Besides, Lin Feng was still very young. He was two years younger than Duan Han. Two years was enough for Lin Feng to exceed Duan Han even without the same resources. Lin Feng was much more talented than Duan Han.\u201cNo matter what you say, strength is strength, weakness is weakness. Today, he will die.\u201d Said Duan Han furiously.\u201cAlright, we don\u2019t need you to get involved, Fei Fei. Sooner or later, you will become a member of my family so come and stand next to me.\u201dDuan Tian Lang had said that while looking at Liu Fei. It sounded like he was convinced that Liu Fei would someday become the wife to his son.\u201cIn your dreams! I, Liu Fei, will never be a member of your family!\u201d Screamed Liu Fei in disgust.\u201cHmph, Liu Fei, don\u2019t say such things in front of me. That\u2019s a great offense. Don\u2019t forget that the Duan family is also a part of the Imperial Clan.\u201dDuan Tian Lang moved his arm. Immediately after, all the cavalry on their Chi Xie armored horses once again raised the bows that they had just put down.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I am offering you a great opportunity but you don\u2019t know how to appreciate it. Since you have decided to act this way, then\u2026..\u201dDuan Tian Lang suddenly stopped speaking and then raised his hand.He waved his hand down as a signal and then a storm of arrows began whistling through the air while releasing a strong Qi.\u201cThey\u2019re attacking!\u201dThe whole crowd had now realized that they were in danger. After that they saw Duan Tian Lang wave his hand again and say the following words; \u201cTotal extermination!\u201dThese two words resonated in everybody\u2019s mind as if the words were said by a terrifyingly evil god.\u201cWhoosh\u2026Whoosh\u2026Whoosh\u2026\u201dWhistling sounds filled the entire atmosphere. What seemed like an endless shower of arrows was piercing through the atmosphere above the Stormy Gorge. However no arrows were aimed at the stage of the Life and Death Arena where Duan Tian Lang was standing, this was the only location which was not a target for arrows.The whole crowd was looking at the arrows flying above their heads and were terrified. Most of them had already given up all hope of escaping alive.There were so many arrows and each of them was as swift and powerful as a meteor crashing down from the heavens. The cavalry on the Chi Xie armored horses were definitely incredibly powerful.Horrible shrieks could be heard and resonated through the entire gorge. Some of the Yun Hai Sect\u2019s disciples had been hit by arrows in the head, shoulders, chest and arms\u2026 Bright red blood was filling the gorge like an ocean.Only the strongest cultivators within the gorge had managed to avoid the arrows. It was already difficult to dodge the arrows and this was also only the first wave of arrows.Nan Gong Ling was looking at the arrows flying above his head. He was still standing on the bleachers. Some arrows flew above his head but he managed to disintegrate them into dust which then continued flying past him. An immense sorrow could be seen in Nan Gong Ling\u2019s eyes while he was looking around at the current scene. He then closed his eyes because he couldn\u2019t stand seeing all his precious disciples being killed before his eyes. All these disciples admired him and worshipped him as the Patriarch. In front of that spectacle, he felt absolutely powerless.The Elders of the sect were feeling the same as they watched the bloody spectacle before them. They would have never expected that the Yun Hai Sect would ever go through such horrible hardships. This truly felt like a nightmare. They would never have expected the total extermination of the Yun Hai Sect would occur on this day.The first wave of arrows had finally come to an end. The blood from all the dead disciples created a small river of blood which was flowing through the gorge which was drowned in silence.Lin Feng, who was standing inside the Life and Death Arena, was calmly looking at the blood flowing through the gorge. The sunlight was shining down on his skin yet he didn\u2019t feel any warmth at all. He just felt an endless coldness running through his veins.In the Stormy Gorge, some people had entered deaths embrace while some others were still struggling against death even in their last moments. Those who were about to die were crying tears of regret while staring at the heavens and screaming in pain.If this was the previous world, there were many disciples who were still very young and would have still been going to school.They had parents, brothers and sisters\u2026 Their future was still filled with endless possibilities.They had come to the Yun Hai Sect to become stronger and to receive an education in cultivation. They had come hoping to improve their lives and allow their families to have better living conditions.But after Duan Tian Lang\u2019s voice resonated in the atmosphere, their future of endless possibilities had turned to dust. Death was already here for them and their bodies were already floating within a sea of blood.Lin Feng\u2019s heart had never felt so cold. He felt so cold that he had the feeling his heart was losing blood through stab wounds. These young disciples were just like him: made of blood and flesh. They still had a long life before them. Many of these young disciples had done nothing wrong and were just trying to improve their families well being.\u201cPsssshhhhhhhhh\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dLin Feng took a long and deep breath of the desolation before him. He then looked closely at a thicker artery of that bright red river of blood with his eyes wide open and had the feeling that he was drowning in an endless pit of sorrow.The strong cultivators could steal the future which belonged to the weaker people of this world\u2026 They could slaughter them and exterminate them as they would do to bugs.That was the cruel and sad reality of this world. Those who were not powerful were like insects to be crushed by those stronger cultivators.\u201cFire\u2026..\u201dDuan Tian Lang\u2019s voice spread throughout the atmosphere again making the stones of the gorge tremble. Sharp and deadly arrows started piercing through the air again like evil spirits falling from the sky.Horrible shrieks spread throughout the atmosphere. There was nothing to be done though. The ordinary disciples who were particularly vulnerable could only stare on in despair.\u201cAHHHHH\u2026\u2026\u201dA horrible shout filled with pain and agony filled the gorge.Liu Fei was kneeling down on the ground looking at the corpses while grabbing her beautiful long hair with such power that it ripped some from her head. Her delicate cheeks no longer had a rosy complexion and she stared on lifelessly.The ones killing these people were the cavalry on the Chi Xie armored horses\u2026 her father\u2019s own army.Those who were being killed were the Yun Hai Sect\u2019s disciples\u2026 they were her fellow disciples\u2026 but also her father\u2019s fellow disciples.She like many others could only stand there and watch the slaughter with broken hearts while unable to prevent the massacre from happening.\u201cDuan Han, bring her over here.\u201d Duan Tian Lang had said with a cold tone while looking at Liu Fei.Duan Han slightly nodded and moved towards Liu Fei.But at that moment, an extremely quick and agile silhouette quickly landed in front of Liu Fei. It was Lin Feng.\u201cGet lost. If you want to die, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s only a matter of time.\u201d Duan Han said while looking expressionless.But Lin Feng seemed like he hadn\u2019t heard Duan Han\u2019s words. He was only staring at him with his pitch black eyes. He was looking at Duan Han with a cold and calm expression.How ruthless would someone need to be to remain calm while thousands of people had been and were being salughtered?\u201cHuh?\u201d Duan Han frowned and look at Lin Feng\u2019s eyes which looked incredibly evil.These cold and evil eyes suddenly made Duan Han shiver.\u201cSince you want to die right now, I will finish you off.\u201dDuan Han shouted while his face twisted in anger. He was furious because he had shivered from fear while in front of Lin Feng and Duan Han felt humiliated.Even though he didn\u2019t deny the fact that Lin Feng was a genius with incredible talent, he still thought that Lin Feng had no right to humiliate him because he was just a nobody from no name clan.The sight of Lin Feng and Liu Fei caring for each other made him especially furious. He wanted Lin Feng to kneel down at his feet. He wanted to show Liu Fei that Lin Feng was a weakling and a nobody. He could never compare with the majestic blood which ran through his veins.Duan Han\u2019s sword started to glow. He had a Sword Spirit and had been learning sword skills since he was a child. Swords had almost no secrets from him. His sword skills were so advanced that he didn\u2019t even need a sword in order to use his sword skills. In his hands, almost anything could become a sword.An extremely powerful sword Qi emerged from the palm of his hand and created a strong wind moving towards Lin Feng.Duan Han wasn\u2019t using any specific skill. He wanted to show Liu Fei that he was extremely powerful and could kill Lin Feng with a simple wave of his palm.\u201cPierce.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s body moved gracefully towards the attack. He grabbed his sword and pierced towards Duan Han\u2019s sword Qi aiming exactly at its weakest point.Duan Han immediately understood. He perfectly understood that the Qi that he was using had taken form. It was very clear to him which part of it was stronger and which part was weaker.\u201cPssshhh!\u201dDuan Han\u2019s sword Qi vanished in an instant.Lin Feng\u2019s sword which was filled with a deadly Qi was still moving towards Duan Han at an incredible speed.Duan Han was surprised but reacted quickly. He raised his right hand and released a strong Qi which shot towards Lin Feng\u2019s sword with a whistling sound.However this Qi still wasn\u2019t enough to stop the attack. The sword which was rushing toward him did not even slightly slow down. The sword was still filled with a deadly Qi which smelt like death and destruction.Duan Han frowned. He was a cultivator of the fourth Ling Qi layer. He was much stronger than Lin Feng, but why did Lin Feng\u2019s sword give him such a bad premonition.Duan Han raised both his hands to stop the extremely powerful deadly Qi but it didn\u2019t work. His body was projected backwards by Lin Feng\u2019s powerful attack.\u201cDie!\u201dLin Feng said with a calm and ruthless tone. The Qi from his long sword was giving the feeling that death itself was contained within the sword.His sword force was also emerging endlessly from his long sword. The Qi and force emerging out of Lin Feng\u2019s sword looked so natural as if it was absorbed directly from the power of heaven and earth.\u201cHow is that possible?\u201dDuan Han stared onwards and could not believe his eyes. The sword force, that sword, everything had merged into perfect harmony. Even with his years of training he was unable to perform such a feat.That sword was as fast as lightning and its power was incredible. Duan Han had absolutely no time to counter an attack with such power. He had no choice but to dodge.\u201cHe\u2019s probably using his Sword of Nirvana. Being able to keep up that power even during a second attack is really incredible. Lin Feng is a genius when it comes to learning skills. His power is really terrifying. He will definitely not die today.\u201dProtector Bei\u2019s attention had been on Lin Feng from the beginning. Everybody in the Yun Hai Sect could die except for Lin Feng.Protector Bei wasn\u2019t being cruel or merciless when thinking that everybody could die except for Lin Feng. He just thought that if only one person survived, it had to be Lin Feng because he was the only hope of a future that the sect had. Protector Bei even thought that if he had to die, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem as long as Lin Feng stayed alive.\u201cShadow Steps\u201dDuan Han started moving at full speed. His entire body looked like a shadow while it tried to escape Lin Feng\u2019s deadly sword.He then stopped and looked at his clothes. They were torn and ragged from almost taking that previous attack. When he saw that, his face changed and he looked hideously evil.Lin Feng had surprisingly almost injured him and had managed to tear his clothes.If he had been a single step slower then that deadly sword would have directly pierced into his chest.Duan Han could only feel extraordinary shame and humiliation. He, who had broken through to the fourth Ling Qi layer, had suddenly almost been injured by Lin Feng, who had only broken through to the second Ling Qi layer. Just like a moment ago, he had been humiliated by Lin Feng again.\u201cYou are very lucky but now I will have to get serious.\u201dDuan Han was trying to hide his anger and remain calm. He was, of course, not going to admit that he had almost been injured by Lin Feng because of his own arrogance. He would rather attribute it to Lin Feng\u2019s luck.\u201cYou have broken through to the fourth Ling Qi layer. I have broken through to the second Ling Qi layer. You are apparently extremely strong and apparently I\u2019m not even worth the effort of fighting. Yet I almost injured you and then you attribute it to luck. I see you must not have been serious when you just ran away with your tail between your legs. Duan Han, don\u2019t you think that you are shameless pretending to this extent?\u201dLin Feng had a smile on the corner of his mouth. His pitch black eyes were radiating killing intent. His words were ridiculing Duan Han.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 - A Lonely SwordPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHow can you be so shameless here?!\u201dLiu Fei had moved closer to Lin Feng. She was looking at Duan Han with an icy stare, her eyes were filled with hatred and contempt.Duan Tian Lang and his son had destroyed the Yun Hai Sect. She would make sure that these two disgusting people were going to regret it for their entire life.When Duan Han heard that Liu Fei was insulting him, his face looked really ugly. Duan Han had always thought that Liu Fei would become his wife and seeing his future wife insult him and protect another man had made him furious.\u201cI am shameless? That piece of trash is not even able to defeat me and I am shameless?\u201d said Duan Han while coldly looking at Lin Feng and then said: \u201cFei Fei, I will show you the gigantic gap that exists between him and me. The difference is way too big.\u201d\u201cI am at the second Ling Qi layer and you are the fourth Ling Qi layer. You are obviously very strong but bragging in front of me can definitely be described as being shameless.\u201d Said Lin Feng who wasn\u2019t scared of Duan Han in the slightest. He then added: \u201cIf you are brave enough then try and attack me.\u201d\u201cHmph, I will just show you that I don\u2019t even need to move from where I stand to defeat you.\u201d Shouted Duan Han.Duan Han was furious because of Lin Feng\u2019s sharp tongue. He stood in the same position while waiting for Lin Feng to make the first move.Lin Feng\u2019s dark eyes revealed a slightly happy expression for a second.Lin Feng suddenly closed his eyes and had a feeling of absolute peace and serenity. He felt at peace in this world made of darkness.The loudest noise would not have been able to disturb Lin Feng at that moment. In Lin Feng\u2019s mind, there was only a dark world filled with coldness and the smell of death.Lin Feng had the feeling that there was no sword Qi existing in this world and the Life and Death Arena was absolutely calm inside this world of darkness.At that moment, a grayish black shadow emerged out of Lin Feng\u2019s sword slowly filling the atmosphere. It looked like the shadow of death which had come to claim the dead.Death is cold. Death is dark. Death is here.Lin Feng opened his eyes and they were filled with an indescribable darkness which made him look even more heartless than before.Lin Feng started moving and the grayish black Qi which was emerging out from his long sword started to follow him.His sword looked like it could annihilate all of the ten thousand things within creation.He then began another strike using the skill Sword of Nirvana.\u201cLonely sword.\u201dThe force diffused by the sword was much weaker than before. The Qi didn\u2019t make whistling sounds as it pierced through the air. The sword this time seemed lonely and silent.The sword carried the smell of death as if it was going to annihilate everything within the world to make itself the only thing remaining; a lonely sword.Duan Han\u2019s face drastically changed. It was as if he understood the danger of the sword which was in Lin Feng\u2019s hand. He was surrounded by such a terrifying energy which smelt like death and battle, he could not help but tremble in fear.\u201cCelestial Propulsion!\u201dDuan Han used a high quality skill of the Xuan Level. An extremely powerful essence appeared in front Duan Han\u2019s body while he started to retreat.\u201cCrrrr\u2026.\u201dA small sound was heard. The lonely sword had the power to annihilate all things within creation. Even Duan Han\u2019s high quality Xuan level technique had vanished when it touched the energy emitted by Lin Feng\u2019s sword.\u201cGet lost.\u201dAt that moment, a loud shout spread throughout the atmosphere. A dazzling sword broke the Qi from the lonely sword. Lin Feng\u2019s body was projected back like a leaf in the wind but the attack eventually reached its destination and Lin Feng coughed out several mouthfuls of blood.The one who had attacked was Duan Tian Lang. His face had grown extremely cold. He looked like he was ready to murder Lin Feng on the spot.Sword masters were in perfect fusion with their swords to the extent that they could exchange energy with each other.This was called unity force. Unity force enabled sword masters to move but powered by the sword force granted by their swords. It also enabled them to carry out even stronger and more powerful attacks which no longer relied on Qi.Only real geniuses could learn to master their force to such an extent. They would need to be at a minimum of the Ling Qi layer to use unity force. However the force was much more efficient and powerful when cultivators had broken through to the fifth or sixth Ling Qi layer before using it.Duan Han, Duan Tian Lang\u2019s son, at the moment when he had broken through to the third Ling Qi layer had learnt how to use unity forces. He was a real genius.The sword Qi and sword force released when using unity force is not easily dispersed. Unity force was thickly condensed with power and several times stronger than normal forces. Only sword masters who were geniuses could comprehend the power behind unity force before having reached the Xuan Qi layer.Lin Feng who had only broken through to the second Ling Qi layer had managed to trick Duan Han. Lin Feng had started using unity force a moment ago but he couldn\u2019t control it which is why Duan Tian Lang had time to interrupt his attack.At that moment, Lin Feng had blood spilling out of the corner of his mouth but his dark eyes were still revealing a happy expression.\u201cFather and son fighting together against a single disciple. We really do have nothing in common. I could never be that shameless.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s words were so sharp that Duan Han had the feeling he was being stabbed through the heart.\u201cYou shut the hell up!\u201d said Duan Han extremely furious which made him look like a demon. He hated Lin Feng from the bottom of his heart.\u201cDuan Han, what\u2019s the point in arguing with someone who is already dead?\u201d Duan Tian Lang had said that in a loud yet indifferent voice and then started moving straight towards Lin Feng.\u201cDuan Tian Lang, attacking junior disciples is really the worst thing a wise senior cultivator could do. You are a worthless person.\u201dNan Gong Ling and a few elders fell from the sky and landed in the Life and Death Arena just in front of Lin Feng.Duan Tian Lang stepped forward however when he saw all the elders who were accompanying Nan Gong Ling he hesitated. Suddenly, an extremely powerful Qi filled with the atmosphere and the sky looked like it was going to collapse under the pressure.\u201cWe will slowly kill these old guys over time but first we must kill Lin Feng.\u201dDuan Tian Lang had said this with a neutral tone as if he had said nothing special. He had brought along some outstanding cultivators to support him and did not fear the power of the Yun Hai Sect: the Patriarch of the Hao Yue Sect, the Patriarch of the Ice and Snow Village Mountain as well as the one of the Mo Shou Sect. They were all monstrously powerful cultivators in their own right. They had also brought along their elders and disciples as support. They were a much stronger fighting force than the Yun Hai Sect.At this time, their goal was to annihilate the Yun Hai Sect, take everything that belonged to them and then share it equally between them.That was actually one of the reasons why Duan Tian Lang had managed to convince all these Patriarchs to join him and help him get outstanding disciples to send them to the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue.There were many things to take from the Yun Hai Sect: amazing treasures, profound skills and agility techniques, as well as these outstanding young disciples.\u201cChi Xie armored cavalry troops, slaughter them all.\u201dDuan Tian Lang made a wave of his hand. Immediately the cavalry on the Chi Xie armored horses started galloping towards the inside of the gorge.\u201cDuan Tian Lang, I am the Patriarch of the Yun Hai Sect, if you want to destroy it then you will need to fight against me.\u201dNan Gong Ling started moving with extreme speed and a gigantic Qi which contained elements of force shot straight towards Duan Tian Lang.\u201cWhy would I be scared?\u201d said Duan Tian Lang while smiling coldly and then, his body immediately rose into the air.Nan Gong Ling followed him into the air. High up in the air, Duan Tian Lang\u2019s sword started glowing and hr tried to attack Nan Gong Ling with an extremely powerful sneak attack.\u201cBOOM!!\u201dThe gigantic Python Fish had its wings wide open and the Patriarch of the Mo Shou Sect was sitting atop it looking evil. The eyes of the beast were extremely terrifying.\u201cHow evil.\u201dProtector Bei released his crane spirit then it flew up at the speed of lightning and threw itself at the flying Python Fish. Everybody else was choosing an opponent and a large scale battle began to take place.It was a huge battle field filled with blood and power. It was like a hurricane was moving from place to place and leaving behind destruction and bodies.On the ground, in the air, no matter where it was within the stormy gorge there were battles taking place.The fighting stage of the Life and Death Arena was shaking so much that it looked like it was going to collapse under the pressure.Lin Feng\u2019s pitch black eyes were looking around at the huge battle. Lin Feng had the feeling that the Patriarch, Protector Bei and these elders of the sect were fighting for him. Lin Feng would have never thought that these people would try to annihilate the Yun Hai Sect. He especially never thought that so many people would fight for him.An extremely cold feeling invaded his heart like a waterfall of ice. Lin Feng felt a sudden sense of belonging within the Yun Hai Sect, people were fighting for him. They were risking their lives to protect him.Nan Gong Ling, Protector Bei as well as other elders were very powerful. They might have the power to win this battle or scare the opponent from the fight without risking their lives. Nothing was certain but at least there was still some hope to be found. However they were all fighting with their life on the line because of him, a disciple of the Yun Hai Sect.\u201cThe Yun Hai Sect.\u201dLin Feng whispered the name of the sect while looking at the sun light that was shining down on the river of blood.\u201cLin Feng.\u201dAt that moment, a voice spread throughout the atmosphere. Lin Feng turned around and was surprised.He only saw someone with a cold look who was moving towards the fighting stage. The eyes of this person looked like they were ready to murder.It was Mo Xie!\u201cFilthy Animal.\u201dLin Feng saw Mo Xie\u2019s cold smile getting clearer and clearer as Mo Xie was approaching him.In such a horrible and desperate situation, Mo Xie who was an Elder wasn\u2019t fighting for the Yun Hai Sect but was moving towards Lin Feng to settle personal grudges. In that chaotic and apocalyptic situation, Mo Xie had decided he would use the opportunity to kill Lin Feng.\u201cWhy would you kill me now? What\u2019s the point? Wouldn\u2019t it be better to try surviving now?!\u201dLin Feng was looking at Mo Xie who was moving towards him with a cold murderous look.\u201cWell, do you think that if I hand you over to Duan Tian Lang, he will still want to kill me? In such circumstances, I will not need to struggle to survive and can live comfortably.\u201dMo Xie had a particularly evil smile on the corner of his mouth. Lin Feng was astonished to hear such shameless words leave the mouth of an elder. It was already impossible to be more shameless and despicable than Mo Xie.\u201cI really admire you. Being so incredibly shameless and on top of that being able to smile with happiness while you watch your sect be destroyed.\u201d said Lin Feng.\u201cWhy? Why not just consider winners to be great and losers to be trash? Losers in my eyes are always in the wrong. Duan Tian Lang is powerful and if he wants to annihilate the Yun Hai Sect, then it is useless to go against his will. Those risking their lives for the Yun Hai Sect right now are stupid and ignorant losers.\u201dNot only was Mo Xie cruel and heartless but he also sounded extremely arrogant. It really seemed like he had no values at all.\u201cSince it\u2019s like that, come, I will end your pitiful life.\u201dThese words had come directly from Lin Feng\u2019 heart. It seemed easier said than done but Lin Feng already looked like he was ready to kill Mo Xie.Mo Xie frowned and suspiciously stared at Lin Feng.A second later, Mo Xie looked relaxed again as if he was worrying for no reason. Even though Lin Feng was a genius, it was impossible for him to kill Mo Xie.\u201cSuch a pity\u2026 I will kill you like an insect between my two fingers. I will make you die slowly and painfully.\u201dMo Xie released his Boa Vine Spirit and immediately vines emerged beneath Lin Feng\u2019s feet.Mo Xie was attacking Lin Feng with a surprise attack even though they greatly differed in power. Lin Feng was suddenly wrapped up in the vines from the sudden attack. Surprisingly, Lin Feng was not attempting to resist.Mo Xie hadn\u2019t noticed that Lin Feng had a smile on his face.\u201cIt looks like you have already given up. Don\u2019t worry, I will kill you very slowly and use your head as a trophy.\u201d said Mo Xie while looking extremely cruel.At that moment, a shadow was climbing up Mo Xie\u2019s body.That shadow was intangible. It was almost invisible and did not look like something that should exist within this world.\u201cIs that so?\u201dSuddenly, Mo Xie stopped moving. His body was no longer under his control. He shivered from head to toe in fear.It\u2019s him!!!Mo Xie would never forget that day when that black shadow had completely oppressed him.At that moment, there was a shadow that was preventing him from moving.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 - Sorrow and TragedyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cLin Feng, you already knew about this, right?\u201dMo Xie had the feeling that his body was completely frozen. He was unable to move. Lin Feng, a moment before, hadn\u2019t dodged his attack but he had allowed himself to be attacked willingly.But that shadow hadn\u2019t appeared since the last time so how could Lin Feng have any idea that it would appear?\u201cElder.\u201dMo Xie said that to the shadow but didn\u2019t dare try to move. He was scared because his life could end in a single moment.\u201cThe sect has such degenerate Elders like you remaining, this is such a disgrace.\u201dThe voice came out of nowhere. Suddenly, a dark green light flashed through the air with incredible speed. No silhouette was seen, only a light as it flashed through the air. When the light vanished, the silhouette had finally appeared. This person was wearing a black cloak which seemed to hide part of his face. Suddenly, the silhouette took out a dagger which had bright red blood dripping from the tip.That blood was obviously Mo Xie\u2019s.Mo Xie was still standing at the same place as a moment before and was still completely motionless.His eyes were wide open as if he couldn\u2019t believe his eyes, he still could not believe that within that split second that elder had ended all his chances of life in this world.Blood suddenly started spilling out from his throat and his body collapsed heavily onto the ground.\u201cI would have never thought that, someday, I would use this dagger against an Elder of the sect. How lamentable.\u201dThe old man\u2019s voice sounded desolate.\u201cProtector Kong.\u201d said Lin Feng to the old man in the black cloak.So that\u2019s how it was. That shadow belonged to the old man who protected the Precipice of the Abyss.\u201cHow did you know that I was here?\u201dProtector Kong looked at Lin Feng while nodding. When he used his Shadow Spirit, there was only a shadow. A moment ago, Protector Kong hadn\u2019t revealed that he had arrived and yet Lin Feng had willingly lured Mo Xie into attacking him.\u201cPerception.\u201dLin Feng replied calmly. His spirit enabled him to sense the world. He didn\u2019t need his eyes to observe it. He could sense and perceive all things and their movements.In Lin Feng\u2019s brain, that world of darkness was actually extremely clear as if he was the creator of the darkness. Everything that surrounded him was known to him and appeared with total clarity.Even though Protector Kong had been using his shadow, Lin Feng had surprisingly been able to sense his presence. Lin Feng then understood that the shadow was the one that had protected him last time he had been attacked by Mo Xie.Protector Kong then nodded.\u201cLin Feng, you are the most extraordinary young man that I have ever met. You are a true genius. Leave this place and go far away. Go as far as you can and let\u2019s hope that someday, the Yun Hai Sect will be reborn again.\u201d Protector Kong\u2019s voice was filled with sadness. He was a protector of the Yun Hai Sect and on that day, the sect which he was protecting, was being exterminated.\u201cIf I am alive, I will definitely bring the Yun Hai Sect into the future.\u201dLin Feng solemnly nodded as a sign that he was making a promise to the old man. However he still had to get out of that massacre alive.Duan Tian Lang would never let him off.\u201cAaaaahhh!\u201dIn the sky, blood was raining down. Someone wearing dark clothes had been killed. It looked like an Elder of the Yun Hai Sect.\u201cKong Ming, I\u2019ve been waiting for you for a while.\u201dThen a silhouette fell from the sky and landed in front of Protector Kong.Protector Kong was speechless and he was shaking in anger. His facial expression suddenly drastically changed and he vanished in the blink of an eye. There was only his shadow remaining on the ground.At that moment, a silhouette in the sky was looking at the blood and then at Mo Xie\u2019s cadaver on the ground. That person\u2019s face was filled with hatred.\u201cYun Hai Sect, I have done so much for you and in the end, you end up killing my only son. How could you!\u201dMo Cang Lan had gone insane. He turned around and looked at Duan Tian Lang and Nan Gong Ling who were fighting.\u201cDie!\u201d thought Mo Cang Lan evilly. His silhouette then flashed through the atmosphere and landed next to Nan Gong Ling and he wholeheartedly started fighting on Duan Tian Lang\u2019s side against Nan Gong Ling.Nan Gong Ling didn\u2019t know that Mo Xie was dead so he didn\u2019t understand what was happening. Mo Cang Lan\u2019s attack projected Nan Gong Ling straight towards Duan Tian Lang\u2019s sword.Suddenly, blood gushed out of Nan Gong Ling\u2019s left arm and mixed with the bright light released by the sword. Nan Gong Ling\u2019s left hand had been completely cut off by the sword.\u201cMo\u2026. Cang\u2026 Lan!\u201dNan Gong Ling fell down onto the ground but didn\u2019t even look at his hand which had been cut off. Instead, he was staring at Mo Cang Lan who had pushed him into the attack\u2026 Mo Cang Lan, his friend and a Great Elder of the Yun Hai Sect.\u201cThis is my revenge.\u201d said Mo Cang Lan coldly while looking at Mo Xie\u2019s corpse lying on the ground.Nan Gong Ling then noticed Mo Xie\u2019s corpse, and his own wound\u2026 then at Protector Kong in the middle of a fight.Mo Xie had been killed by Protector Kong.Nan Gong Ling was obviously able to understand what had happened.\u201cIt is good that he finally got what he deserved.\u201dNan Gong Ling said while sounding indifferent. He then looked around him. He saw that many Elders were in weak positions and that the opponents still had many people who hadn\u2019t even gotten involved in the fights yet. They were just there to prevent people from escaping.\u201cAll the members of the Yun Hai Sect, gather around me immediately.\u201dNan Gong Ling had shouted these words very loudly and suddenly, a multitude of people were coming from all sides towards the fighting stage of the Life and Death Arena.More and more people stopped fighting against their current opponents; they left them behind and joined Nan Gong Ling on the highest fighting stage.Apart from Nan Gong Ling who had had his hand cut off, many other people were injured and covered with blood. Lin Feng was standing behind the crowd. He looked calm but his eyes were filled with sorrow in front such a tragedy.\u201cDo you know what to do now?\u201dWhile blood was unceasingly spilling out of Nan Gong Ling\u2019s arm, he was fixedly staring at Duan Tian Lang.Everybody in the crowd didn\u2019t need explanations. They all nodded as a sign that they had understood what Nan Gong Ling meant.\u201cProtector Bei, Take him.\u201dNan Gong Ling had said that to Protector Bei in a solemn tone.Protector Bei nodded solemnly. His Crane Spirit, amongst all the people who were present, was the strongest and the quickest of spirits. Immediately after, Protector Bei landed on Lin Feng\u2019s side. He released his spirit, spread his wings and grabbed Lin Feng.Lin Feng had finally understood what Nan Gong Ling meant. They wanted\u2026\u2026Everybody, including all of the Elders were staring at Lin Feng. All sorts of expressions could be seen on their faces but a few of them revealed\u2026 hope!Everybody was looking at Lin Feng with hope. Lin Feng was their only hope.Lin Feng had a big headache. He had the feeling that he had just received a mountain of pressure on his shoulders. These strong people wanted to give up their lives to make sure that Lin Feng escaped alive. They wanted to sacrifice themselves for him. All these lives\u2026 to save a single life. Many of these people were strong enough that they might be able to survive if they attempted to escape alone.While there was no bond between Lin Feng and many of these people, they had all chosen to entrust the future to him. Because Lin Feng did not have strong ties to the sect, they did not know what he would do if he escaped alive, but they all still had relieved expressions as if they had done all that they could.The only one who wasn\u2019t looking at Lin Feng was Nan Gong Ling. He was observing the opponents.\u201cI, Lin Feng, have my own talents and my loyalty cannot be bought.\u201dHow could he not have faith in the person who said these words? Nan Gong Ling had only thing in mind, let Lin Feng escape while they cleared a path for him.\u201cGo!\u201dNan Gong Ling shouted extremely loudly, he then immediately jumped into the air again and prepared for battle.Everybody started moving at the same time as Nan Gong Ling.\u201cThe sect is being destroyed under my reign\u2026 Yun Hai Sect, please forgive me! I\u2019m so sorry!\u201dAn extremely powerful Qi was released from Nan Gong Ling\u2019s body and he threw himself into battle to clear a path without hesitation. This was the greatest regret of his life, that in his time the Yun Hai Sect had been reduced to such a sorry state.\u201cYou will die!\u201dA loud shout filled the air and suddenly a glowing sword whistled in the air accompanied by multiple different attacks.\u201cBOOOM!\u201dNan Gong Ling\u2019s body turned into nothing but ashes.The youngest Patriarch in the history of the Yun Hai Sect\u2026. had perished!Nobody seemed to feel sorry for him or was crying loudly, all the Elders of the Yun Hai Sect were calmly looking at his dead body. They were being attacked from all sides as well as they distracted the enemies from chasing Lin Feng. This was not how things were supposed to be.Some elders were still trying to dodge the incoming attacks and to fight against the enemies of the sect. They didn\u2019t care about dying for the sect but they were still hoping to survive long enough to kill their opponent.\u201cDie!\u201d\u201cDie, die, die\u2026.\u201dA strong wind was blowing over the arena. Each and every Elder tried to survive as long as they could and fight sparing no effort while using their full strength. The opponents were only attacking and didn\u2019t even need to defend themselves.Each and every single of these Elders was falling down under the various attacks. This was the last chance that they had to show their will and determination. Lin Feng was looking at them and didn\u2019t blink even once. All these people who were fighting to the death would turn their head around and have one last look at Lin Feng before they died.\u201cLet\u2019s go\u2026\u201dProtector Bei finally started moving at full speed like a comet moving towards the horizon.The wings of the crane were creating whirlwinds as they flapped through the air. The power of these whirlwinds was painful to Lin Feng like blades striking his skin, but at this moment his heart was in even more pain. His fellow disciples, his friends and even those elders that owed him nothing, but they still gave their lives for him. They were all going to die while he would have to live on.\u201cWhere do you think you are going?\u201dA loud voice spread throughout the atmosphere. It was just as incisive as ever. A dazzling sword appeared. It was the old man which was stood next to Duan Tian Lang.\u201cPiercing shadow, die!\u201dA loud voice spread throughout the atmosphere but seemed to come from nowhere. Only a dark green light flashed but that light, everybody saw it.The possessor of a Shadow Spirit could kill without moving. He could pull out other people\u2019s souls out of their body and take their lives.\u201cHow dare you!\u201d shouted a voice extremely loudly. The shadow and the gigantic dazzling sword collided into each other. For a second, it seemed like they were both attempting to swallow the other. The old man was injured and blood started to flow from his chest.At that moment, the shadow appeared while the arm and the dagger had disappeared from sight.Protector Bei hadn\u2019t even seen what had just happened and continued flying towards the horizon.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 - The Ancient TemplePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cYou cannot leave.\u201dAnother voice spread throughout the air behind Lin Feng and Protector Bei. The Python Fish was spitting in and out a thick smoke. It suddenly opened its gigantic mouth and took a deep whistling breath which resonated in the atmosphere while releasing a strong Qi.At the same time, a Legendary Roc spread its gigantic wings and flew towards Lin Feng and Protector Bei.The strong Qi and the air currents in the atmosphere slowed Lin Feng and Protector Bei\u2019s escape. Lin Feng had the impression that his body was going to be swallowed by the beasts chasing him.If Protector Bei wasn\u2019t firmly controlling the situation, Lin Feng would have already been eaten by The Python Fish.The Legendary Roc was a Xuan level beast. It was extremely powerful. Only cultivators of the Xuan Qi layer could control them. A single breath could release an incredible amount of energy and Lin Feng, at that moment, would be unable to withstand even half of a breath.\u201cSuppress them!\u201dTeng Wu Shan was on the body of the Legendary Roc and was shouting. He took out some pitch-black chains and threw himself at Lin Feng while attempting a surprise attack.\u201cGet lost!\u201dA loud shout was heard. The pitch-black chains had been intercepted by someone and that person was the old woman.\u201cGo! I will kill this evil animal!\u201dThe old woman\u2019s voice was calm but Protector Bei solemnly nodded. There were only two people who were strong enough to catch up with him: one of them was the old man carrying a huge sword and the other was Ten Wu Shan who was riding the Legendary Roc. These two people had both attempted to intercept him with their attacks.The old man had been injured by Protector Kong so if they managed to kill the Legendary Roc, nobody would be able to catch up with Lin Feng.Concerning what the old woman had said, Protector Bei had doubts and suspected she wouldn\u2019t have the power to kill the roc.\u201cI still remember our agreement. Please remember to tell Liu Cang Lan, that little bastard, that I forgive him. As far as Wen Ren Yan and Liu Fei\u2019s wedding is concerned, let\u2019s forget about it, Lin Feng is suitable for this position.\u201dThe old woman said calmly. Protector Bei laughed but didn\u2019t reply.\u201cHmph, you are not allowed to brag until you have actually killed my legendary roc.\u201dTeng Wu Shan said that while smiling coldly. He then made the pitch-black chains shake so much that the old woman almost lost balance. As she looked like she was about to fall, the legendary roc was ready to swallow her whole.Xuan level beasts were extremely intelligent, thus when the old woman said that she wanted to kill it, she had earned the hatred from the beast.\u201cAn animal is animal!\u201dThe old woman shouted extremely loudly in a cold tone. Her long hair was floating in the air. Then, a viper shadow appeared behind her back. It then seemed like her entire body had transformed into a snake. Immediately after, she threw herself straight towards the open mouth of the legendary roc.That\u2019s right. She didn\u2019t resist and instead she hurled herself straight into the mouth of the legendary roc. At that moment, she was inside its body.When Lin Feng saw that, he was extremely moved.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Protector Bei said indifferently. They looked behind them one last time and flew away at the speed of light.They only heard a tremendous roar fill the air from a distance away as they continued to move into the horizon. Lin Feng had already guessed what had happened to the legendary roc.As far as the tensions between Lin Feng and Wen Ren Yan were concerned, Lin Feng didn\u2019t hate the old woman at all for having saved Wen Ren Yan. He could understand her and why she had saved her only student. The old woman didn\u2019t care about losing face to save her only disciples life.In the Yun Hai Sect, she was a protector. She was also ready to sacrifice her life for the sect.That old woman was really ugly and had terrible judge of character but was definitely worthy of respect.At that moment, nobody was able to catch up with Protector Bei. The wings of his crane spirit were flashing through the air at the speed of light and in the blink of an eye, they had disappeared from the Stormy Gorge without a trace.Protector Bei and Lin Feng finally escaped from the Yun Hai Sect alive but they didn\u2019t have any happy emotions from surviving the catastrophe. They knew that their lives had been saved because of all the blood that was flowing down the Stormy Gorge.At the Precipice of the Abyss, there were only cliffs and precipices, nothing else. Apart from the passageway leading to these precipices, the only other possibility to access or leave the place was by flying there.At that moment, the silhouette of a crane was flying towards the Precipice of Zhangu and was about to land by the square room filled with drums.Lin Feng recognized this place, he was surprised. Actually, he even had doubts. Protector Bei hadn\u2019t brought him far away from the Yun Hai Sect, rather he had brought him to the precipice of Zhangu.\u201cWe\u2019re going down.\u201dProtector Bei looked at the Precipice of Zhangu and immediately after they landed there. They were surrounded by a dense fog.\u201cDo you remember this place?\u201d asked Protector Bei to Lin Feng.Lin Feng didn\u2019t really understand why the Protector Bei was asking him that but he nodded and said: \u201cI remember this very well.\u201d\u201cYes, walking from passageway to passageway and precipice to precipice, you just end up here.\u201dWhile talking, Protector Bei tapped a stone three times and suddenly a stone wall started moving and a door appeared.These cliffs and precipices really constituted another world but also offered a scenery of exceptional charm.\u201cLet\u2019s go inside.\u201d said Protector Bei while bringing Lin Feng in. Then, the door closed itself making a loud slamming noise.The place that they entered looked like a temple. It looked like an extremely temple within a palace. It was filled with an antique type of Qi.In the middle of that temple, there was a painting of a dragon and a phoenix. There were a multitude of pillars as well which were supporting the walls of the ancient temple. On these pillars, there were a myriad of carvings representing different ferocious beasts. Surprisingly, Lin Feng had never seen many of these ferocious beasts. He was shocked that he did not know of the beasts on the carvings.\u201cThe Yun Hai Sect didn\u2019t build and established itself here for its physical features. It actually established itself here because they had discovered this temple.Protector Bei\u2019s voice was resonating in the temple and he then continue to introduce the place to Lin Feng: \u201cExtremely strong cultivators in the past must have regularly come here in the ancient times to practice cultivation. Of course, this place may have also been an ancient sect. Some of the most powerful and mysterious skills and techniques that you can find in the Xing Chen Pavilion were actually brought from here. Before we found these skills and techniques, the Xing Chen Pavilion didn\u2019t have that many extremely powerful skills. But because news spreads quickly and there are many people with bad intentions, this place is kept secret from everyone within the sect. Only protectors of the Yun Hai Sect know about this place. Even the Patriarch does not know that this temple exists.Extremely strong cultivators of the ancient times came to practice here? Even the Patriarch didn\u2019t know that place?Lin Feng was touched by the fact he had been told this secret. Surprisingly, only protectors of the sect were allowed to come here.Lin Feng was observing the temple with all of his attention. It was imposing, gigantic and the Qi flowing in the air was extremely powerful. The temple was filled with all sorts of treasures, skills, techniques and weapons. Even though they were covered in dust, they were all very old and probably extremely powerful.\u201cLin Feng, come with me.\u201dProtector Bei started walking and brought Lin Feng into the depths of the temple. A short instant later, they found themselves in front of the entrance of a small room. In the middle of that room, there was a brown wood carving. There was also a bookshelf in which there were many books. Even though they were covered with dust, they were perfectly arranged and sorted which meant that someone had tidied this place recently.\u201cWe\u2019re going to take all of the skills and techniques of the Xing Chen Pavilion. They are all handwritten copies. The lowest skills and techniques are of the Xuan level. The highest skills and techniques are of low quality Di level ones. There is an incredible amount of books but they are extremely hard to learn and many cannot be practised. Even the protectors found them difficult to learn. Practicing them even a little bit already enables us to carry out extremely powerful attacks. You can choose an appropriate skill for yourself to learn.\u201dIf Lin Feng had come to this place before, he would certainly have been overjoyed but at that moment, he couldn\u2019t express the slightest sign of happiness. All the events that had occurred were uninterruptedly appearing in his mind. He couldn\u2019t get rid of these horrible images.\u201cLet\u2019s go and check another room.\u201dProtector Bei wasn\u2019t done showing things to Lin Feng. He then brought him to another antique room.\u201cWeapons.\u201dThe floor made of stone was diffusing an extremely old yet strong Qi which made Lin Feng feel shivers.These weapons all had spirits.These weapons had spirits, they were spiritual weapons.\u201cYou can call them weapons but it would be more precise to call them spiritual weapons.\u201dProtector Bei, continued his explanations while sounding solemn: \u201cWeapon is a word used to describe ordinary weapons but these weapons here have spirits. They are extremely powerful and unique.\u201dProtector Bei walked towards an ancient sword and grabbed it. He then said to Lin Feng: \u201cGive me the sword that you\u2019re carrying on your back.\u201dLin Feng slightly nodded and handed his long sword to Protector Bei.Protector Bei didn\u2019t use any skill or technique but Lin Feng\u2019s long sword flew into the air towards Protector Bei and collided into the other sword.\u201cCLANG!\u201dAn incredibly clear and melodious sound resonated in the room. A sword then moved straight into Lin Feng\u2019s hand. That sword was extremely sharp and looked beautiful and shiny.\u201cAll of these weapons are not ordinary weapons. They are all spiritual weapons\u2026 an ignorant man can quickly become a criminal\u2026 but treasuring a jade ring is also a crime. We have never let the weapons see the real world but from today, all of them will belong to you.\u201d\u201cBelong to me?!\u201d Lin Feng was astonished. Protector Bei was still there alive but he was giving everything to Lin Feng?!\u201cIndeed, everything that is here now belongs to you.\u201d stated Protector Bei solemnly while nodding. He then took a stone which was laying amongst all the weaons. It looked ordinary.\u201cThis is an ancient Na stone. It is empty inside. If you put a drop of blood on the top, the space which is inside that stone will open itself for you.\u201dProtector Bei explained the things to Lin Feng while handing the stone over to him.Lin Feng used his sword to cut the tip of his finger. He then let a drop of blood fall onto the stone. His blood was slowly flowing on the stone and then something strange happened.The Na stone diffused a bright and dazzling light. Lin Feng\u2019s blood became extremely red and slowly started spreading through the stone.At that moment, a wonderful sensation and emotion welled up in Lin Feng\u2019s heart. It was if Lin Feng and that stone had created an indescribable and unbreakable connection.Lin Feng had the feeling that his entire consciousness had connected with the stone. Inside of that stone, there was an incredibly huge space which was full of items.A strangely familiar smell invaded Lin Feng\u2019s nostrils which suddenly made him shiver.\u201cIs it\u2026?\u201dLin Feng\u2019s pupils were dilated and staring at Protector Bei.\u201cYou are right. This is Nan Gong Ling\u2019s Qi. When he was still alive, everything that belonged to him, everything that belonged to the sect was stored in that stone. Now, you are the owner of that stone.\u201d declared Protector Bei solemnly. Then, he fixedly stared at Lin Feng and said: \u201cLin Feng, from today, you are the new Patriarch of the Yun Hai Sect.\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 - Deadly Cross ShadowPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cLin Feng, from today, you are the new Patriarch of the Yun Hai Sect.\u201dProtector Bei was speaking in a solemn and quiet tone. Lin Feng was trembling from head to toe while staring blankly at Protector Bei.\u201cLin Feng, even though the Yun Hai Sect probably has nobody left, I don\u2019t want it to let it disappear forever. That was Nan Gong Ling\u2019s wish as well. In the future, if you have the chance then I hope that you can rebuild it and revive the Yun Hai Sect.\u201dWhile looking at the myriad of wrinkles present on the old man\u2019s face, Lin Feng nodded solemnly and respectfully.\u201cIf I, Lin Feng, don\u2019t die, I will definitely revive the Yun Hai Sect.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dProtector Bei smiled and tapped on Lin Feng\u2019s shoulder with his right hand.\u201cLin Feng, there is something else I have to tell you.\u201d\u201cProtector Bei, please tell me.\u201d\u201cIn the past, Fei Fei\u2019s father, Liu Cang Lan and Nan Gong Ling were the most outstanding disciples of the Yun Hai Sect which gave endless hope to everybody within the sect. Before Nan Gong Ling became the Patriarch of the Yun Hai Sect there was Nan Gong Ling\u2019s teacher and former Patriarch. Actually, he would have preferred to make Liu Cang Lan become the Patriarch. He also wanted to give him his only daughter for marriage.\u201d\u201cBut after that, Liu Cang Lan decided to leave the sect abandoning everything behind him. He wanted to let Nan Gong Ling become the Patriarch but what Liu Cang Lan didn\u2019t know is that the Patriarch\u2019s daughter had already fallen in love with him. Because she had been abandoned by Liu Cang Lan, she was feeling so desperate that\u2026. she committed suicide. Because of the death of his daughter, the Patriarch at the time suffered so much. One day he left the Yun Hai Sect and never came back. Nobody knows whether he was dead or alive.\u201d\u201cSince that moment, Nan Gong Ling became the Patriarch of the sect. Besides, Liu Cang Lan had completely lost face so he couldn\u2019t come back to the Yun Hai Sect. As an apology, he made Fei Fei join the Yun Hai Sect\u2026 He wanted to apologise to the former Patriarch and to his daughter, even more to the former Patriarch\u2019s wife. Her beloved daughter had passed away and her husband had disappeared without leaving trace. Therefore, the old woman had a deep and bitter hatred for Liu Cang Lan. She became Wen Ren Yan\u2019s teacher and dreamed of seeing her student getting married with Liu Cang Lan\u2019s daughter, Fei Fei. That is why Wen Ren Yan had dared to act such a way in the Yun Hai Sect.\u201dWhen Lin Feng heard all of these things, his heart was pounding. He was astonished. He wouldn\u2019t have thought that the Yun Hai Sect had such secrets. No wonder Wen Ren Yan was so arrogant and dared say that Liu Fei was his. No wonder that the old woman had seemed so eccentric. That explained everything.\u201cLin Feng, did you hear the old woman when she told me to tell Liu Cang Lan that she forgave him? She also said that she had no objections to you getting married with Fei Fei. However, this is your private life and I\u2019ll let you arrange the things yourself.\u201d Protector Bei was speaking honestly, pouring out the content that was locked away in his heart and then continued: \u201cLiu Cang Lan should be in Duan Ren City now. You can go and look for him. He is an honest man. He is afraid of fighting with Duan Tian Lang though. If something happened to Liu Cang Lan, please take good care of Liu Fei.\u201d\u201cProtector Bei, there is nothing happening between Liu Fei and me.\u201d said Lin Feng while smiling wryly. The old woman had only said that Lin Feng was better suited for Liu Fei than Wen Ran Yan, did that mean that he had to marry Liu Fei?\u201cWhat the old woman said was a suggestion. You have to go tell Liu Cang Lan that Liu Fei is still in the Yun Hai Sect. Duan Tian Lang, considering Liu Fei\u2019s status, would never dare kill her\u2026 but if Liu Cang Lan fell from power or died, things would be different. Therefore you must take good care of Liu Fei. Besides, Liu Fei is also an outstanding young woman. You two are a perfect match.\u201d\u201cAlright, we have talked enough for now. The temple is yours. Dispose of it as you wish. Don\u2019t forget to go and find Liu Cang Lan.\u201d\u201cProtector Bei.\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s voice was firm. Protector Bei\u2019s tone of speech made Lin Feng have an ominous premonition.\u201cOn that side, there is an exit\u2026 It leads to the Black Wind Mountain. Please be careful. Of course, you can also practice in the temple. You can wait to become a little bit stronger and then go out.\u201d said Protector Bei while scratching his ear. When he finished talking, he turned around and headed to the exit.\u201cProtector Bei, you\u2026\u2026..\u201d Lin Feng\u2019s facial expression drastically changed. He ran after Protector Bei and wanted to shout and ask him to stay.\u201cLin Feng, I am a Protector of the Yun Hai Sect. While the Yun Hai Sect still exists then I can live, however if it were to be destroyed then how can I continue living without protecting it?!\u201dWhen he finished talking, Protector Bei was already leaving. The large stone door opened making a rumbling noise. Protector Bei didn\u2019t turn around and left Lin Feng alone within the temple. Lin Feng stared at Protector Bei\u2019s back as he left.Lin Feng had the feeling that lightning was surging in his heart. He was standing there while gazing blankly into the distance. While the stone door was closing itself, Protector Bei\u2019s silhouette was gradually vanishing. This would probably be the last time he saw Protector Bei.Lin Feng understood clearly that this temple didn\u2019t only separate him from the rest of the world\u2026 It was a spiritual separation like the Yin and the Yang. It was the key to eternal life.Lin Feng stood there alone at the same place for a long time while staring blankly into the distance and then finally started moving again. He closed his eyes and took a deep sorrowful breath which resonated throughout the temple.\u201cPatriarch, Protector Bei, Protector Kong, Old Woman\u2026 these noble elders\u2026 they sacrificed themselves to save my life. They fearlessly handed themselves over to those despicable people to protect me\u2026\u201d\u201cThey are not here anymore\u2026 but I am still here\u2026 and I have so many things to do.\u201dLin Feng was talking to himself. His sad expression had turned into a determined expression full of willpower.It required an extraordinary strength to change destiny. Lin Feng wanted to make these people who had given their lives for him a chance to find peace in death. He would make them proud and they would not die in vain.\u201cHao Yue Sect, Ice and Snow Mountain Village, Mo Shou Sect, Duan Clan, Han Xue Tian, Teng Wu Shan, Duan Tian Lang, Duan Han, Mo Cang Lan, Wen Ren Yan.\u201dAll these names, all these treacherous people. They were deeply engraved in Lin Feng\u2019s memories. He would never forget about them. He would one day get revenge for the events which had happened today.Lin Feng turned around and walked towards the first room he had visited.In that room, there was a huge bookshelf full of agility techniques and martial skills. It was divided into sections. One section was dedicated to agility techniques and one section was dedicated to martial skills.\u201cBlade Cadence, low Di level agility technique, produces pure and sharp energy to propel oneself.\u201dLin Feng looked at an agility technique but it didn\u2019t suit him at all. The best was to possess a Blade Spirit when using that agility technique. Of course, Lin Feng was too weak at the moment to use the energy required. He couldn\u2019t learn and practice such agility techniques. After getting stronger and after breaking through to the Xuan Qi layer, he would be able to control pure energy which was extremely powerful.Lin Feng put the book back into the bookshelf and checked two martial skill books.\u201cSwift Leaves\u2026 skill of the low Di level. Leaves emerge out of the palm of the user. These leaves are faintly discernible and extremely quick. It seems like they have no power, but they can actually penetrate directly into the opponent\u2019s body causing internal damage. These leaves are extremely powerful and can go almost unnoticed.\u201dThat looked like a skill suited to a female cultivator. It didn\u2019t look that strong but if the opponent underestimated that skill, they would probably die in horrible conditions. A female could easily get close and kill her opponent without anyone seeing an attack.Besides, that attack was faintly discernible which made it almost impossible for opponents to block it.Lin Feng put it down and looked at another skill.Deadly Cross Shadow\u2026 low Di level skill. Suitable for people whose spirits enable them to become invisible. It is divided into three movements: Vanishing Shadow, Dark Shadow and Deadly Cross Shadow.\u201cThis is similar to Protector Kong\u2019s skill!\u201d thought Lin Feng. His heart bounced for a second. It seemed like Protector Kong had only learnt the first part of the skill and had combined it with other skills. Besides, it was a perfect skill for his Shadow Spirit. It was extremely strong.Too bad that Protector Kong hadn\u2019t been able to practice until Dark Shadow Pierce, otherwise, he could have been really invisible.As far as the last part of the skill was concerned, Deadly Cross Shadow, it was indeed extremely powerful making you almost undetectable by the enemy.\u201cMy Celestial Spirit enables me to release a special cloaking Qi and the illusionary demon makes my opponents suffer of hallucinations. Combined with my spirit, that Deadly Cross Shadow should be perfect.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s heart was racing. That skill had no strength requirement. A cultivator of any Qi layer could learn and practice it as long as they could understand the complexity of the skill.That skill was only a tool though, a way to complement one\u2019s other skills. Bringing Deadly Cross Shadow into play could strongly enhance a person\u2019s other abilities.Lin Feng then continued looking at other skills. He didn\u2019t find any other skill which was appropriate for him. He then put all the skills on the bookshelf into the Na stone.Apart from Lin Feng, the Protectors hadn\u2019t told anybody else about that place. These things should be safe in the bookshelf but if Lin Feng had a problem, it was probably better to have them near him, especially in case of emergency.Lin Feng then went to the other room where there were the spiritual weapons. He also began putting them inside the Na stone.There were a lot of purity stones in the temple, Lin Feng also put them all in the Na stone.Purity stones contained pure Qi like that of heaven and earth. Any cultivator who had at least, broken through to the Ling Qi layer, could use these to enhance their cultivation. It was a very valuable item.How could Lin Feng not take these precious items with him?Lin Feng walked around in that vast temple, he made a few rounds and noticed that on the pillar situated at the both ends of the temple, the ferocious beasts engraved into the stone were exactly the same.Only by looking at the drawings of the ferocious beasts, Lin Feng could feel an extremely strong and powerful Qi. It was much stronger than that Xuan level Python Fish.But Lin Feng was more concerned with something else. There was a greenish door made from carved jade which was emanating a strong Qi. Lin Feng tried to push it in vain. No matter what strength he put into it, it wouldn\u2019t move. Furthermore, there also seemed to be no hidden lever or switch to open the door.\u201cWhat is the secret of that door? Maybe the one who built this temple has left hints behind. Too bad that I can\u2019t open it.\u201dLin Feng frowned. Protector Bei hadn\u2019t opened the door for him. Maybe none of the Protectors of the Yun Hai Sect had ever opened this door before.\u201cNever mind. If I have the opportunity and I am strong enough, I will come back and try again.\u201dLin Feng said these few words while finally giving up. In the history of the Yun Hai Sect which dated back to a thousand years, nobody had ever opened that jade door. It was obviously very hard to open and it would be a waste of time to stay there for too long trying to open it.These days, the most important thing was to become stronger. Strong enough to protect himself and strong enough to protect those who are close to him.Lin Feng had broken through to the second Ling Qi layer which was extremely rare for his age but if he had to face cultivators who had cultivated for a few years longer then he would be in a critical situation, no matter their talent. He needed to become strong.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 - Girl Inside The IllusionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThere was a bed made of stone which was appropriate for the practicing of cultivation techniques. Lin Feng sat cross-legged on that bed and entered into a state of meditation. He was absorbing pure Qi from the purity stone. However he quickly opened his eyes with a perplexed look.On the path of cultivation, sitting and meditating wasn\u2019t enough to advance to the next Qi layer. Knowledge was also necessary as well as enlightenment on the path of cultivation.Lin Feng had the feeling that he had absorbed enough pure Qi in order to break through to the third Ling Qi layer. It was enough Qi at that moment to condense into the next layer but he had yet to breakthrough. He would break through to the next Ling Qi layer at the right moment. When the water comes, a channel is formed.\u201cIt feels like a week has passed since I entered the temple.\u201dLin Feng tried to estimate the time he had spent in the temple. He then immediately stood up and walked towards the exit.Considering Lin Feng\u2019s strength, it was impossible for him to leave the same way he had arrived, he could not fly. He had no choice but to walk through the long and narrow passageway towards Black Wind Mountain.Lin Feng was convinced that this passageway had been constructed by the previous generations of the Yun Hai Sect. It was impossible for the ancient cultivators who owned the temple to spend so much time digging in the rock to create such a long passageway to go to the Black Wind Mountain. Why would they need to do something so hidden?The ancestors of the Yun Hai Sect had created that place for the members of the sect to take refuge. They would have never thought that the Yun Hai Sect would never get the chance to escape from an attack and that they would be slaughtered leaving behind a river of blood.Lin Feng had walked for a while when he arrived at the end of the passageway. At that point, the passage was so narrow that he had to crouch down to exit.It was really extremely dark and Lin Feng observed the sky for the first time in over a week. It was night and the full moon was brightly lighting the sky. The air was chilly and Lin Feng could sense the cold in his lungs and throat.This place was the summit of a chain of mountains.\u201cSurprisingly, this is where the passageway leads to. It\u2019s a very safe route.\u201d thought Lin Feng filled with admiration for those who had created the passageway. This place was a part of the Black Wind Mountain and it seemed like no humans had ever been there. This place was mainly occupied by ferocious beasts. Ferocious beasts in that part of the Black Wind Mountain were much larger than average so even if they found the entrance of the passageway, they\u2019d never be able to gain access because the passageway was very small and narrow.Apart from ferocious beasts, even if human beings found the entrance of the passageway, who would be willing to crawl through the dark passageway for such a long time without knowing where it led?A small rock which was hanging above of the entrance of the passageway fell down and rolled across the floor.Lin Feng sat on that rock and stared at the full moon. His eyes revealed disappointment\u2026Lin Feng felt extremely lonely.Back in the days, he had been riding his horse from Yangzhou City towards the Yun Hai Sect crossing a wide range of landscapes including lakes and rivers. Back then, he would have never thought that the Yun Hai Sect would give birth to lakes and rivers\u2026 of blood. Lin Feng was thinking about that bloodbath and replaying the massacre over and over in his head.He had no choice but to hope for a better future.It was a cold and windy evening. Lin Feng\u2019s robes were flowing in the wind but Lin Feng remained motionless like a statue.At that moment, the Qi of heaven and earth had started fluctuating in a strange way. It suddenly started rushing towards Lin Feng as if it was going to pierce into his bones and flesh. It was both marvellous and intriguing at the same time.Lin Feng wasn\u2019t really paying any attention to the events happening before him. He just kept looking at the moon with a look of sorrow on his face. At that moment, Lin Feng wanted to forget everything. He had really lost too much.\u201cHuh?\u201dLin Feng had just been sitting on that rock for a little while and something incredibly strange happened. Lin Feng was astonished.A milky pure energy was floating around his hands. It was more condensed than what Lin Feng had ever experienced before.\u201cI broke through to the third Ling Qi layer?!\u201dLin Feng was dumbfounded. He wouldn\u2019t have thought that sitting on that rock for a little while would make him break through to the next Ling Qi layer. He attributed the event to his previous meditation but mostly to his own luck.\u201cThird Ling Qi layer\u2026 that coupled with all the cards I now hold, if I meet Duan Han now, I should definitely be able to defeat him.\u201dWhen Lin Feng remembered Han Man, his eyes formed into an icy glare. Duan Han and his father all had to die\u2026 for having exterminated the Yun Hai Sect. They had exterminated his closest friends\u2026\u201cWHO DARES??\u201d shouted Lin Feng extremely loudly. He turned around and his pupils shrank.At that moment, a silhouette appeared in front of him but Lin Feng had the impression it was a hallucination.It was an extremely beautiful silhouette. The moon was shining upon that exquisite silhouette allowing Lin Feng to clearly see some of her physical features.What a beauty. Lin Feng had the impression that he was dreaming. She was wearing thin white robes. Anyone who saw her would feel like protecting and hugging her but would certainly not feel enchanted.\u201cSuch perfection!\u201dLin Feng was stupefied. Even if he felt determined and had a lot of willpower, when seeing this young girl, he could only, be amazed at the beauty of the women in this world. They all looked so beautiful and delicate, much more than in the previous world. Many of them even looked like goddesses.Liu Fei was extremely beautiful and she was incredibly strong. Lin Feng had realised that beauties of this world were on another level.The girl who was in standing front of Lin Feng looked like an illusion. She actually looked like\u2026 a painting!\u201cWho are you? What are you doing here?\u201dThe incredibly beautiful girl opened her mouth and her voice sounded out, breaking the illusion. She wasn\u2019t an illusion but she was so beautiful that she didn\u2019t look real.\u201cMy name is Lin Feng. How did you find your way to this place?\u201dLin Feng was too perplexed and intrigued when looking at this young girl. It was at night in a lost corner of the Black Wind Mountain and suddenly a beautiful girl had appeared from out of nowhere. Lin Feng was utterly confused at how this had happened.Lin Feng moved towards the girl to see her better and as expected, that girl didn\u2019t look weak. She even looked remarkably strong.\u201cLin Feng\u2026\u201dThe girl whispered Lin Feng\u2019s name again for herself and then immediately said: \u201cI\u2019ve always lived here. Suddenly, you come here and ask me what I am doing here?\u201d\u201cI also don\u2019t know how I found this place.\u201d Lin Feng shrugged and replied but it was unlikely that she would believe him.\u201cSince it\u2019s like that, please leave.\u201d said the girl giving a cold stare.\u201cBut I don\u2019t know where I am or how to leave.\u201d said Lin Feng smiling wryly. He only knew where the entrance of the passage way was but he didn\u2019t know where he was at that moment and where to go from there. He didn\u2019t know where he was exactly.\u201cAre we in the Black Wind Mountain?\u201d asked Lin Feng.The girl stared at Lin Feng. He surprisingly didn\u2019t even whether it was the Black Wind Mountain or not.\u201cIndeed, this is the hinterland of the Black Wind Mountain.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Lin Feng was stupefied. This was the hinterland of the Black Wind Mountain?\u201cProtector Bei probably never walked here before.\u201dLin Feng was smiling wryly. On the outskirts of the Black Wind Mountain, there were strong ferocious beasts but inside the Black Wind Mountain, there were even more powerful ferocious beasts and they were constantly running wild. If Lin Feng wanted to get out of here then it wasn\u2019t going to be easy.If Protector Bei had known this before then he probably would have never left Lin Feng alone in the temple and would have never shown him the passage way.\u201cYou just said that you\u2019ve always been living here?\u201dLin Feng just realized what the girl had said. He was stupefied. There were people living in the Black Wind Mountain?\u201cIndeed. I\u2019ve been living here with my mother since I was a child.\u201dThe girl was nodding her head confidently.\u201cHave you never been out of here?\u201d asked Lin Feng.\u201cNever.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Lin Feng didn\u2019t know what to say but he was thinking that it was better for such a beautiful and delicate woman to never venture outside. She was so beautiful that she would cause great trouble wherever she went. She looked lovely enough that she might just cause the downfall of the country.\u201cMaybe her mother is as beautiful as her and this is why they enjoyed living in seclusion.\u201d thought Lin Feng.He then asked her: \u201cAre there no ferocious beasts in the area?\u201d\u201cNo, there aren\u2019t any.\u201d said the girl shaking her delicate head.Lin Feng slightly nodded. No wonder that she could live here all of her life, if there were no ferocious beasts in that area it wouldn\u2019t be very dangerous.\u201cDo you want to leave here?\u201dThe girl suddenly asked Lin Feng while staring at him. Her eyes were sparkling.\u201cOf course, I want to leave tomorrow morning.\u201d Said Lin Feng.\u201cI\u2019ll help you leave here and I\u2019ll come with you.\u201dThe girl opened her mouth again but this time Lin Feng had a weird feeling. She would bring Lin Feng out of this place on her own?In the Black Wind Mountain there were many dangerous ferocious beasts. That girl didn\u2019t seem to be a weak cultivator but she also seemed to be about as young as Lin Feng which meant she couldn\u2019t be that strong. How could she walk through the Black Wind Mountain so easily?Lin Feng\u2019s spirit smelt like that of the Imaginary Demon so that made things easier for him in the Black Wind Mountain. He could disguise himself as one of the ferocious beasts and walk freely around the mountain.\u201cYou don\u2019t trust in my strength?\u201d asked the girl as if she could read Lin Feng\u2019s thoughts?\u201cOf course I don\u2019t. The Black Wind Mountain is extremely dangerous, do you think that it is easy? Besides, you said that you have never left here before.\u201d\u201cEven though I have never left here, I know the Black Wind Mountain better than anyone. I even know where to go in order to avoid ferocious beasts. It is very easy for me come and go as I please.\u201dThe girl said while sounding indifferent and also looked at Lin Feng expressionless.Better than anyone? She knew how to avoid ferocious beasts?Lin Feng was stupefied. He was looking suspiciously at that beautiful young girl. If she could really avoid fighting while navigating the mountain then it would indeed be safer.\u201cDo you agree to help me leave?\u201d asked Lin Feng.\u201cYes, I have never left here but I would like to see how it is on the outside. If I get out of the Black Wind Mountain, I will also need your help.\u201d said the young girl very honestly.\u201cWell, your mother\u2026..\u201d\u201cShe went out. I still don\u2019t know when she\u2019s coming back. No need to worry about her.\u201dLin Feng was a bit confused but it would be very hard alone in the Black Mountain Forest with all these extremely powerful wild beasts.Lin Feng nodded and asked: \u201cThen when should we leave?\u201d\u201cNow.\u201d replied the young girl.\u201cAright, I want to go to the Yun Hai Sect. Do you know it?\u201d said Lin Feng as he stood up.\u201cI know. I know everything in the Black Wind Mountain\u2026 but if I leave the Black Wind Mountain, I\u2019ll be lost.\u201dThe young girl replied honestly showing that she was extremely na\u00efve.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 - I will just show youPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe tops of the trees was still covered with early morning fog. Some people could already be seen walking past the gate leading into the territory of the Yun Hai Sect at the foot of its mountain. Most of them were going to the Yun Hai Sect. Very few people were walking away from the sect.At that moment, a young man and a young woman were walking towards the Yun Hai Sect. They were looking at the mountain where the Yun Hai Sect was and they both smiled.\u201cGirl, this is the Yun Hai Sect. Duan Tian Lang really is an incredibly powerful man. He completely destroyed the Yun Hai Sect within one day\u2026 that\u2019s why everybody admires him in the Xue Yue Country. Nobody will ever dare provoke him or his family in the future. Besides, I heard that he has an enemy in Duan Ren City. His enemy has a Divine Arrow Spirit. When he heard what happened to the Yun Hai Sect, he started coughing blood. It seems like he is seriously ill.\u201dWhen the young man wearing luxurious clothes told the young and beautiful girl these things, they both laughed wholeheartedly.\u201cBesides, now that the Yun Hai Sect has disappeared our Qing Yi Sect has expanded faster. Nobody in the surrounding area will dare to attack us.\u201d\u201cIndeed. If the big sects of the country don\u2019t come attack us, this entire area is ours.\u201dThe young girl laughed and said: \u201cEvery day is different. The Yun Hai Sect used to be extremely powerful and now it is nothing but dust. Over time everything would eventually fall. The sect became so strong that many people are now frightened of you. Core disciples could maybe compete with you but elite disciples are worthless. Besides, you\u2019re only seventeen years old and you\u2019re already so powerful. You\u2019re a genius. Your future is filled with endless opportunities.\u201d\u201cHaha, our Qing Yi Sect is much stronger now. It can\u2019t be compared with the Yun Hai Sect of the past. We have so many geniuses. They only had a few good skills and techniques, that\u2019s all. The Yun Hai Sect was a bunch of crappy cultivators. If we keep improving our stock of skills and techniques, we\u2019ll become much stronger than they ever were.\u201dWhen the young man wearing the luxurious clothes heard the young girl praise him, he felt extremely proud of himself and laughed arrogantly.\u201cIs that so?\u201dAt that moment, a voice came from behind. The young girl and boy turned around and saw two people.But the young boy and girl didn\u2019t even look at one of them. They directly stared at the young girl wearing white robes. They were fascinated by her beauty.They had the impression that nothing else existed in the world other than her beauty. They could only see that beautiful girl wearing white robes. She made all the material attractions of that world utterly unimportant. One only wanted to look at her forever. She didn\u2019t look like any other person in the world.The boy wearing the luxurious clothes and his fellow disciple were staring at the beautiful girl and had the feeling they were looking at a spirit.In the world, there were surprisingly people who could be that beautiful.The girl who was standing next to Lin Feng, when she noticed that these people were staring at her, couldn\u2019t help but smile wryly and shake her head.The girl had done exactly as she had promised Lin Feng. They had left the Black Wind Mountain and what surprised Lin Feng the most is that they really had encountered no ferocious beast at all. They had managed to avoid fighting all together.Lin Feng had started to think that the Black Wind Mountain wasn\u2019t actually as terrifying as the rumours described. There were certain paths that were incredibly safe, it was just that very few people knew of these paths.\u201cOf course, the Yun Hai Sect is a crappy sect. Otherwise, how could they have been annihilated so easily?\u201d Said the arrogant young man.The girl who was with the young man couldn\u2019t help but dully stare at the other girl. She didn\u2019t feel at ease because that other girl was much more beautiful than her.She had a lot of self-confidence when it came to her appearance and believed that she was extremely beautiful but at that moment, she had the feeling that she didn\u2019t exist when standing next to that other beautiful girl. That girl was infinitely more beautiful than her.\u201cSince the Yun Hai Sect is a crappy sect then why are the disciples of the Qing Yi Sect, so afraid of going near the Yun Hai Sect disciples? Why do you all keep a distance of a few hundred meters from the sect even now? Why do you all look at the Yun Hai Sect\u2019s disciples with such reverence and respect?\u201dLin Feng said that while smiling coldly. The Qing Yi Sect was an extremely small sect. They suddenly dared criticize the Yun Hai Sect because it had been annihilated. It seemed like they had forgotten that they used to bow down before the Yun Hai Sect\u2019s disciples. They were really a bunch of shameless people.\u201cThat\u2019s because there are rumours which say that the Yun Hai Sect has a great multitude of great skills and techniques, that\u2019s all. I am happy that they are all dead. Besides, we are proud of our sect. We\u2019ve never bowed in front of Yun Hai Sect\u2019s disciples. They\u2019re just a bunch of trash.\u201dThat young arrogant disciple suddenly regained his composure and stopped staring at the girl. His eyes suddenly looked incredibly evil.Lin Feng was accompanied by an extremely beautiful girl who looked like a goddess. How was it possible not to be jealous of him? Such a beautiful girl should be given to the Patriarch of the small Qing Yi Sect as a wife.Suddenly, the young arrogant disciple paused and started looking at Lin Feng with eyes filled with killing intent.\u201cHuh?\u201dLin Feng frowned. His heart felt cold. That young man was suddenly looking at Lin Feng as if he wanted to kill him.The weak are the prey of the strong\u2026 the law of the jungle was the law of this world. If someone wanted to kill someone else, he would have no compassion and do it without hesitation.\u201cIf I understand you properly, the Qing Yi Sect\u2019s disciples are much stronger than those of the Yun Hai Sect, is that right?\u201d asked Lin Feng coldly.\u201cDefinitely. How could the trash of the Yun Hai Sect compare themselves with the great disciples of the Qing Yi Sect?\u201dThe young man becoming more and more aggressive. He wanted to make the beautiful girl accompanying Lin Feng impressed by his confidence and strength.\u201cHehe, I challenged an elite disciple of the Yun Hai Sect one day and I lost. You seem to be even stronger though considering what you are saying. Shall we have a look!\u201dLin Feng had a naive smile on the corner of his mouth making him look harmless and weak.\u201cHehe, elite disciples of the Yun Hai Sect are so crappy. They can\u2019t even be compared with me. But since you are curious, I will show you what a strong cultivator is and how weak you are in comparison.\u201dThe young man wouldn\u2019t have thought that Lin Feng would take the initiative to challenge him. He couldn\u2019t help but be overjoyed. Lin Feng was going to die in such a pitiful way.\u201cBesides, what is a piece of trash like you doing with such an amazingly beautiful girl. When you die, she will stay with me and I will take care of her.\u201dWhile saying these words, the young man in luxurious clothes took out a long sword and waved it through the air. He released his Sword Spirit and started moving towards Lin Feng looking extremely over confident.\u201cSecond Ling Qi layer\u2026 and you think you are going to kill me. That\u2019s surprising.\u201d said Lin Feng on a cold and indifferent tone.Lin Feng raised his right hand and an extremely powerful and strong sword Qi suddenly emerged from his palm and invaded the atmosphere. The young man almost immediately collapsed when he was hit by the pressure. His face turned deathly pale with fright.\u201cThe fact that you use a sword is a humiliation to all swords.\u201dLin Feng said in a cold tone. The young man was already frozen by the pressure of the Qi which Lin Feng released. A thin mark of blood appeared on his throat and with his eyes looking immensely frightened, he collapsed heavily onto the ground.The girl who was accompanying him also looked terrified\u2026 How had her fellow disciple been killed?How strong! How powerful! There was a gigantic gap between Lin Feng and her fellow disciple.When the girl saw that Lin Feng was staring at her, she could not help but start shaking with fear.\u201cI don\u2019t even need to use a single skill to kill trash from the Qing Yi Sect.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s cold expression made him look evil, like a ferocious beast.\u201cTell me your purpose for coming to the Yun Hai Sect.\u201d\u201cThe Yun Hai Sect was completely annihilated. We came here to test our luck and see if we could find a few good skills and techniques. We are not the only ones, many other people want to come here for the same purpose.\u201dThe young man hadn\u2019t died yet and hastily replied to Lin Feng.\u201cWhat about those who exterminated the Yun Hai Sect? Haven\u2019t they stolen everything already?\u201d\u201cThose who exterminated the Yun Hai Sect stayed here for three days after the battle. They stole almost everything but maybe they didn\u2019t care about some skills and techniques which might prove very useful to us. Besides\u2026.\u201d the boy who had just been defeated by Lin Feng looked ashamed. He was being humiliated.\u201cBesides what?\u201d\u201cBesides, in the Stormy Gorge, there are many corpses\u2026 maybe they were carrying things which we could take no that they have died.\u201d\u2026.Lin Feng was shaking in anger from head to toe. These animals wanted to violate the dead bodies of his fellow disciples and elders.An extremely strong and sharp sword Qi invaded the atmosphere.The young man suddenly looked deathly pale again. That sword Qi was so powerful. How strong was Lin Feng?!\u201cCripple your own cultivation and then piss off.\u201dLin Feng sounded extremely cold blooded. He was initially thinking of letting these people off but when he heard that they wanted to steal things from the dead of the Yun Hai Sect, he didn\u2019t feel like being merciful anymore.These two disciples were shaking in terror.\u201cI will let you take three breaths from now, if you don\u2019t cripple your own cultivation, you will not breathe a fourth.\u201dLin Feng had said he would kill them with a commanding tone.\u201cIf I cripple my own cultivation, isn\u2019t it like dying?\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll finish you off now then.\u201dLin Feng released an extremely strong sword Qi which oppressed them so much that they could feel the pressure was ready to crush them. The two young disciples were stunned.\u201cAlright, alright, I\u2019ll cripple my own cultivation.\u201d said the two young people while gnashing their teeth. They raised their hand and stabbed their dantian. They became so weak that they could not even stand, they fell helplessly onto the ground.\u201cMeng Qing, let\u2019s go.\u201dLin Feng said that to the girl who was accompanying him. Lin Feng had helped her find a name because she had told him she didn\u2019t have one.That was the only name that had come into Lin Feng\u2019s mind because Meng meant dream and Qing meant lover and any man would have dreamt of having that girl as a lover. That was the only name which Lin Feng could come up with that would match her.Of course, the girl didn\u2019t know why Lin Feng had chosen that name for her. Actually, the outside world was completely unknown to her.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you kill them?\u201dMeng Qing suddenly asked Lin Feng that question which surprised Lin Feng. He was blankly staring at her.\u201cWhen I look at their eyes, I feel like vomiting.\u201dMeng Qing had replied to her own question. Her face revealed that she wasn\u2019t used to speaking with other people.\u201cWhen you look into my eyes, what do you feel? I will just show you.\u201dLin Feng was stupefied. Meng Qing\u2019s expression seemed like she suddenly had a great idea and she ran forward.Meng Qing didn\u2019t really understand Lin Feng\u2019s feelings but Lin Feng found her to be cute and charming. Unknown warmth filled his heart.Lin Feng was observing Meng Qing. He was in admiration of her beauty. She looked so delicate and so cute. There was absolutely nothing detestable about her. Her thoughts were also pure and innocent. Lin Feng found it easy to get close to her.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95 - Each Step Brings DeathPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLife and Death Arena, Stormy Gorge, Yun Hai Sect.A bright red river of blood was flowing through the Stormy Gorge. Even though seven days had passed, the river of blood was still flowing.There was a legion of corpses lying on the ground. The corpses hadn\u2019t started decomposing yet due to the cold temperature.The strangest thing was that many people were walking around the corpses and didn\u2019t look disgusted by all the blood. They did not seemed disturbed my the scene before them and in the contrary looked overjoyed. Each of these people had eyes filled with greed.\u201cThe Yun Hai Sect deserved the title of a great sect. Even if these corpses only belonged to disciples of the sect, they still have a great deal of items on them.\u201dA male cultivator was kneeling down next to a corpse and took a high quality Yellow Level skill from it. He then looked around him carefully, as if he was scared to be noticed by someone before he picked it up.He wasn\u2019t the only one, there was a multitude of other people just like him stealing things from the corpses within the gorge. They were all disciples of the smaller sects. When they heard that the Yun Hai Sect had been completely annihilated, they had rushed here to see if they would be lucky and could find some treasures hidden on the corpses.At that moment, there were two silhouettes stood at the top of the Stormy Gorge and were about to throw themselves into the gorge.One of them looked fascinatingly beautiful. The other was wearing a mask which had a bronze look. This mask had the capacity to increase Qi.These two people were obviously Lin Feng and Meng Qing.Lin Feng was too famous. All the great sects of the country were looking to kill him. He obviously had to be careful. Therefore, he had taken that mask from inside the temple.When she saw all the blood and smelt the putrid odor released by the corpses, Meng Qing started feeling dizzy. She felt like vomiting when she saw the scene.\u201cWhy did we come here?\u201d asked Meng Qing looking at Lin Feng but she noticed that Lin Feng was absolutely motionless. An extremely cold aura was surrounding his body.\u201cThese animals\u2026 not even letting the dead rest in peace.\u201dLin Feng saw someone who was searching a dead body and when he finished, he kicked it which made the body roll away. Lin Feng was indescribably disgusted at the actions of these cultivators.When she saw Lin Feng\u2019s change in aura, Meng Qing stopped talking. She didn\u2019t want to disturb Lin Feng.Lin Feng spread his arms looking like a bird spreading its wings and jumped down into the gorge.Down in the Stormy Gorge the cultivators who were looting the dead bodies of the Yun Hai Sect members could feel a bad premonition. Something was about to happen. They all started to look around and then looked at Lin Feng who was jumping down into the gorge.\u201cHere comes somebody again\u2026\u201dEverybody then stopped looking at Lin Feng and continued what they were doing.\u201cHelp yourself but let\u2019s not bother each other.\u201dThe cultivator who had just kicked one of the corpses away said to Lin Feng who had just landed next to him. His manner of speech was indifferent.Nobody replied. An incredibly powerful sword Qi emanated from Lin Feng\u2019s body which stupefied the cultivator who had just spoke to Lin Feng. He started to shake from head to toe with fear.\u201cWhat are you doing? There are many people here. Could it be that you refuse to share the items with anyone else?\u201dWhen that person sensed the Qi released by Lin Feng, he shouted that really loud trying to draw the attention of everyone in the area.Obviously, when the crowd heard that somebody had arrived and wanted all the items for himself, they all turned around and stared at Lin Feng with angry expressions.But they only saw the glow from a sword. It was a bright and resplendent light but it looked deadly. That glow appeared and disappeared in the blink of an eye.Then the cultivator who had spoken loudly was immediately beheaded by Lin Feng. Lin Feng hadn\u2019t pronounced a single word. When everybody saw that, their eyes began to fill with indignation.Because he was an extremely powerful cultivator, that guy wanted to take all the treasures here for himself?!\u201cYour Excellency, everybody has come here with the same purpose. There is no need to be cruel and merciless, otherwise, it would make a powerful man such as yourself look rude rather than your usual elegant self.\u201dA cultivator who wasn\u2019t far from Lin Feng had said with a cold tone.Lin Feng turned around. Lin Feng\u2019s eyes, hidden inside the mask were extremely evil to behold. He didn\u2019t feel like showing mercy to anyone any longer.Lin Feng\u2019s silhouette vanished in the blink of an eye and appeared as quickly in front of the man who had just spoke to him. He then activated his deadly sword.Cruel? Merciless? Rude?This despicable cultivator was stealing various treasures from dead bodies and suddenly talked about cruelty, mercy and rudeness?Lin Feng\u2019s sword started to glow again. The other man\u2019s face turned deathly pale. He was terrified when he saw the display of such power.\u201cSurprisingly, you are the type of person to enjoy spending time with the corpses here, so I will help you become one of them.\u201dThis was the first time that Lin Feng had spoken during the whole event. His voice was filled with cold and merciless killing intent. His mask hid his face which made people even more scared of him.Lin Feng made one step and with a single strike he sent another head toppling to the ground.It was clear that Lin Feng was not playing around. However, it seemed like he was killing these fellow cultivators without any reason.\u201cWhat does he think he is doing? Could it be that he wants to kill everybody within the Stormy Gorge?\u201dWhen the crowd saw that another person had just died, they were all terrified.\u201cStop!! What are you?\u201d said a cultivator who saw Lin Feng walk past him.\u201cI am the one that will take your soul.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s sword started to glow again and as his final word was heard a dazzling light filled the air. The cultivators stared in shock as another headless body hit the floor.All the people who were in the gorge looting from the corpses suddenly stopped and started staring at the strange cultivator wearing the bronze mask. Each time he took a step, another cultivators head would be separated from their body.At that moment, Lin Feng had already killed more than a dozen of the grave robbers already. They didn\u2019t even know what they had done to make Lin Feng so angry.\u201cThis does not look good, we have to find a way to stop him. Otherwise, he\u2019ll end up killing us as well.\u201dSome of the cultivators had understood that the situation was getting more dangerous. When that person finished talking, those surrounding him were all nodding in agreement.\u201cLet\u2019s fight him together as a group. We shouldn\u2019t give him a single opportunity to attack.\u201dThe whole crowd started moving towards Lin Feng as a group and were getting ready to attack him. His sword was too dreadful. It seemed like Lin Feng would behead anyone he encountered on his way.Lin Feng was still moving from place to place and beheading people when he noticed the crowd moving towards him. These people sensed the Qi emanating from Lin Feng\u2019s body and it was growing stronger and stronger.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of him. He cannot deal with this many of us. Even if he is quite strong, there is no way he can defeat this many people at once.\u201dThe closer they got the better they could sense Lin Feng\u2019s Qi, many cultivators had tried to reassure the others. Although it looked like these words were said to reassure themselves before the others.Lin Feng slowly started walking towards the approaching group. The sword Qi was growing stronger and stronger which gradually destroyed the confidence of the cultivators in the crowd.\u201cI don\u2019t want any of the treasures here.\u201dFinally, one of the cultivators who was in the middle of the crowd gave up because he could sense the strong Qi which Lin Feng was emitting. He then turned around and tried to escape. He had the feeling that even this many people couldn\u2019t defeat Lin Feng.\u201cDeadly Sword.\u201dLin Feng took a few steps forward and brandished his long sword. At that moment, a deadly sword Qi invaded the atmosphere and created a hurricane-like wind annihilating everything in its way.\u201cPfff, pfff, pfff\u2026..\u201dThe people in the crowd were breathing heavily. The nearer they were getting to Lin Feng, the more scared they were becoming. They had almost stopped moving and were looking at Lin Feng in terror.At this moment every single cultivator within the group looked down at their chest and saw a small hole which had been pierced.\u201cWhy?\u201dEach and every single one of them started to collapse on the ground one after the other. Even while dying, they still didn\u2019t understand what was going on. Lin Feng was extremely strong, why was he attacking them?\u201cBecause you all deserve death.\u201dLin Feng was holding his sword and turned around and looked at the horizon. There was nobody left. The last remaining grave robbers were running away.Lin Feng had become extremely strong. A moment before, whether it had been a dozen or a hundred cultivators, nobody would have been able to avoid his sword. The only solution would have been to run far away.\u201cWhat cruel behaviour.\u201dSuddenly on the top of the Stormy Gorge, a loud voice could be heard heard. Three cultivators were jumping down into the gorge.\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked the one who seemed to be the leader of the group of three. He was a handsome young man who looked arrogant.Chen Xing was an elite disciple but his name wasn\u2019t carved into the ranking list. He had been very scared of being killed by Duan Tian Lang.Fortunately, Wen Ren Yan had been there to protect him. After having been tested by Duan Tian Lang, he had been recognized as a talented cultivator and he had been assigned to guard the Yun Hai Sect.Wen Ren Yan was extremely strong and Duan Tian Lang attached great importance to him. Duan Tian Lang had thus sent Wen Ren Yan to the Imperial City to join the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue. At that moment, Wen Ren Yan was in the Imperial City and everybody respected him, many had started to worship him.When Wen Ren Yan left the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue, he would become a very important person within the country. Chen Xing didn\u2019t dare provoke Wen Ren Yan and wanted to gain his favour.Wen Ren Yan was extremely strong, he was a genius. Since Duan Tian Lang had also started taking care of him, Wen Ren Yan\u2019s destiny could only be extraordinary.\u201cWell, Lin Feng\u2019s power is even scarier than that of Wen Ren Yan. If he had agreed to leave with Duan Tian Lang, I probably wouldn\u2019t even be alive now.\u201dWhen thinking about Wen Ren Yan, Chen Xing remembered Lin Feng and how scary he was. Even when Lin Feng spoke, it was terrifying.When Lin Feng saw Chen Xing, a light flashed through his eyes under the mask. His eyes looked even more ruthless and evil than before.How shameless. Chen Xing had betrayed the Yun Hai Sect and was acting arrogantly again. He was again treating others like they were beneath him and had obviously not learnt his lesson. How quickly he returned to his old ways.\u201cSince the Holy Courtyard has been created, Duan Tian Lang is extremely busy and has no time to come here and take care of everything. I am here to handle things on his behalf. Everything here belongs to me. If you want to take things from these corpses, do as you please, but don\u2019t make trouble\u2026 otherwise, I will kill you like a worthless dog.\u201dChen Xing was shouting loudly at Lin Feng. His voice was resonating throughout entire gorge. He was still using the same arrogant tone he had before when he spoke to Lin Feng. His voice carried a clear killing intent. Chen Xing thought that he was stronger than anyone from the smaller sects who would come here to loot. He thought that everyone was beneath him and even dared to look down on Lin Feng.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 - A Dreadful NightPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Lin Feng heard what Chen Xing had said, he was even more furious.Before, he was a disciple of the Yun Hai Sect and was respected by everyone. These days, he despised the Yun Hai Sect.Because he was only interested in saving his neck, he had betrayed the Yun Hai Sect. So he had gone and sought refuge with Duan Tian Lang and to make thing worse he let anyone violate the bodies of his former fellow disciples.Chen Xing was a beast, an animal. He did not deserve to live.\u201cDuan Tian Lang is not worried about letting a piece of trash like you manage the Yun Hai Sect?\u201dWhen Chen Xing heard the evil and cold voice that came from behind the mask, he was stupefied. He stared at Lin Feng and asked: \u201cWho are you calling a piece of trash?\u201d\u201cChen Xing, you used to be the best of all the ordinary disciples. however you betrayed the Yun Hai Sect and allowed others to humiliate and violate the bodies of your former sect member. What gives you the right to look so proud and arrogant?\u201dLin Feng had spoken with an ice-cold tone which made Chen Xing shrink back. He was fixedly staring at Lin Feng.\u201cWho are you?\u201dBecause of the bronze mask, Lin Feng\u2019s voice sounded a little different. Lin Feng\u2019s body gestures were a bit different as well. Therefore, Chen Xing was unable to recognize Lin Feng even though he was standing before him.\u201cYou betrayed the Yun Hai Sect and now you\u2019re trying to act like a little boss here. Do you even have a sense of shame?\u201dLin Feng questioned him yet again. His sword started to glow while releasing a strong Qi which created a whirlwind.When that Qi reached Chen Xing\u2019s body, he started shaking violently. His pupils shrank and he was breathing heavily and very quickly.\u201cLin Feng. That\u2019s Lin Feng and he surprisingly still dares to come back to the Yun Hai Sect.\u201dChen Xing was stupefied. Almost all the elders and Nan Gong Ling had died in the battle in order to save Lin Feng\u2019s life. Chen Xing would have never thought that Lin Feng would dare to come back. Duan Tian Lang was looking for Lin Feng everywhere, if he found him, he would make him die in the most horrible conditions.But because everybody thought that Lin Feng would never dare come back to the Yun Hai Sect, Duan Tian Lang hadn\u2019t bothered staying there. He had just asked Chen Xing and two other cultivators of the first Ling Qi layer to stay there and guard the territory of the Yun Hai Sect.These days, all the strongest cultivators had gone to the Imperial City to join the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue. Duan Tian Lang was excited by that major event.Lin Feng was strong enough to walk freely within the territory of the Yun Hai Sect.A horrifyingly strong Qi crashed onto Chen Xing\u2019s body. His back was soaked with cold sweat.\u201cIt seems that you want to know who I am.\u201dWhen Lin Feng saw Chen Xing\u2019s reaction, he laughed evilly. It seemed like he was becoming more and more evil. The two people standing next to Chen Xing were oppressed by Lin Feng\u2019s sword Qi as well but were not brave enough to retaliate in any way.\u201cLet me off. I do not have the power to do anything.\u201dChen Xing was begging Lin Feng. He was terrified by the idea that he would die here after escaping the massacre.\u201cYou can\u2019t do anything? But you did manage to betray the Yun Hai Sect. You also managed to let the smaller sects come to humiliate and disrespect the corpses of your former sect. You had the power to stop them but you didn\u2019t. How can I tolerate such disgrace?\u201dLin Feng took a step forward while his sword started glowing with a magnificent sword force.\u201cI don\u2019t want to\u2026\u201dChen Xing\u2019s weak voice spread in the atmosphere. Suddenly, Lin Feng\u2019s sword disappeared from sight and three different trails of blood gushed up in the air.Nobody had been able to resist to Lin Feng\u2019s sword.\u201cSigh\u2026\u2026..\u201dWhen Lin Feng looked at the three corpses, he exhaled a deep breath.All of those who had come to steal items and treasures from the corpses of the sect had left or were among the corpses. Only Lin Feng was left alive while surrounded by the endless corpses.Lin Feng looked around at all the corpses of his former sect members. He was looking at these corpses lying on the ground with eyes filled with sorrow. Some of them had had their heads split in two, some had been attacked multiple times in the back as they retreated\u2026 the more Lin Feng looked, the more his determination increased.Lin Feng had decided to take the risk to come to the Yun Hai Sect to see these corpses for one last time\u2026 and to see the setting sun refracting on that river of blood.He never wanted to forget that the blood was flowing because of hatred, jealousy and other evil intentions.He wanted to remember that the weak were bullied and killed and that the strong ruled in the world. Lin Feng was furious and anger welled up within his heart.Lin Feng definitely wanted to avenge all the deaths of his former sect members. He would never forget that these people had sacrificed themselves to save his life. He was bearing the weight of too many people on his shoulders. All these dead people had put endless faith in Lin Feng.\u201cBroom vroom, broom vroom vroom\u2026.\u201dAt that moment, the ground started to shake. It was even shaking more and more intensely. The sound of the shaking ground was also getting louder and louder.\u201cChi Xie armored cavalry!\u201dLin Feng\u2019s pupils shrank. Without hesitating, he quickly moved towards the edge of the gorge. He could hear the sound of the incoming heavy cavalry.\u201cMoonlight Feather Agility.\u201dLin Feng stabbed his sword into the cliff in order to propel himself to the top faster. In the space of a few deep breaths he reached the top.\u201cLet\u2019s go quickly.\u201dWhen Lin Feng sensed the ground shake even more, he was stunned. These Chi Xie armored horses were so quick. It seemed like they needed only one breath to gallop over a dozen meters.Lin Feng couldn\u2019t afford to think too much. He grabbed Meng Qing\u2019s little hand and left at full speed.When she felt Lin Feng\u2019s hand holding her hand, she had a strange sensation but considering Lin Feng was anxious and in a hurry, she let him take her hand.Lin Feng had reacted quickly. However there was no way to escape. At that moment, Chi Xie armored horses were arriving at full speed. Lin Feng stopped in his tracks.The cavalry on the Chi Xie armored horses were also wearing armor which looked imposing.When Lin Feng saw the Chi Xie armored horses move nearer, he held Meng Qing\u2019s little hand even tighter. She also held Lin Feng\u2019s hand tighter. But Lin Feng didn\u2019t pay attention to that, he didn\u2019t even notice it. What troubled him the most is that he hadn\u2019t expected the Chi Xie armored horses to come to the Yun Hai Sect and especially at full speed like this.\u201cCould it be that they know that I have returned?\u201d thought Lin Feng.The Chi Xie armored horses were moving closer and closer. They hadn\u2019t stopped galloping at full speed.\u201cHow handsome.\u201dWhen Lin Feng looked at one of the riders, he couldn\u2019t help but be amazed.It was a middle aged man. He looked handsome and had the most dashing eyebrows. However, he looked extremely sad like something sorrowful was haunting his heart.He was wearing a beautiful armor plate which looked quite spectacular. His grey hair was floating in the wind. He looked slightly strange though.The Chi Xie armored horses galloped past Lin Feng and surprisingly didn\u2019t even look at him. Lin Feng couldn\u2019t help but be a bit scared. Maybe he was wrong after all and they were not here for him. They possibly didn\u2019t know that he was Lin Feng.When he thought about it, Lin Feng relaxed a little. When he turned around and saw the Chi Xie armored horse neigh and then jump straight down from the top of the gorge. That looked extremely dangerous.\u201cAmazing\u2026\u201dLin Feng was impressed by the Chi Xie horse\u2019s power. He then turned around and went back to the edge of the gorge and looked down at the scene.At that moment, Lin Feng saw the man with the grey hair stand on the highest fighting stage of the Life and Death Arena. He looked like a statue. He was calmly looking at all the corpses.His gray hair was still floating in the wind. He looked lonely and sad.\u201cCrash.\u201dLin Feng was stupefied. The gray-haired man suddenly kneeled down on the fighting stage of the Life and Death Arena and while kneeling down, his knees had made a loud crashing sound when they slammed into the arena floor.\u201cGeneral!\u201dA loud voice had interrupting him, the voice was spreading through the air and making the atmosphere shake.Immediately after, the other cavalry all got off their Chi Xie armored horses and stared at their General. Some of them kneeled down. He looked like he was injured and his eyes revealed an immense sadness.Lin Feng\u2019s heart was pounding.Lin Feng found it amazing that the other cavalry seemed to care about their General so much.Lin Feng suddenly thought about a name. If the rumors were true, he really looked like that.\u201cDivine Arrow, Liu Cang Lan!\u201dLin Feng was sure that it was Liu Cang Lan. Except for him, who would kneel down in front of the dead disciples of the Yun Hai Sect. Besides, wasn\u2019t he one of the generals within the army?No wonder Protector Bei felt proud each time he mentioned Liu Cang Lan\u2019s name. Such an outstanding student definitely deserved such recognition.\u201cThis is my own business. Stand up everyone.\u201dLiu Cang Lan\u2019s voice was loud and resonated in the gorge. His voice didn\u2019t sound imposing or bossy. On the contrary, it sounded friendly and clear so that everyone could hear properly.\u201cGeneral, please take good care of yourself.\u201dWhen Liu Cang Lan had learnt that his army had been ordered to exterminate the Yun Hai Sect, he had disregarded everything and headed to the Yun Hai Sect. He had immediately put the harness on his horse and had ridden it for three days and three nights without sleep to arrive at the Yun Hai Sect as soon as possible.All the other cavalry wanted to follow him on their own free will.\u201cI order you to stand up.\u201dLiu Cang Lan\u2019s voice was still calm. When they heard him, the cavalry stood up.They would never disobey Liu Cang Lan.\u201cWhen I was seven years old, I joined the Yun Hai Sect. I received a teacher and was respected but then I left and abandoned them for the sake of the Xue Yue Country. I will never forget the affection I received from other Yun Hai Sect members. I will never forget my dear teacher either. But now, the Yun Hai Sect has been destroyed and my army has played a big role in that massacre. I will never forgive myself for that.\u201dWhen Liu Cang Lan finished talking, he started kowtowing in front of all the corpses and hitting his head against the ground of the fighting stage. Suddenly, a noise emerged.\u201cGeneral, Duan Tian Lang had been premeditating this event for a long time. We have all been fooled!\u201dOne of the cavalry troops said that to Liu Cang Lan.\u201cI know that Duan Tian Lang is a monster. He even ordered Fei Fei to convince the best disciples of the Yun Hai Sect to go to the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue. But it is useless to try and find excuses, I have played a big role in this affair as well. I have been unfair to the Yun Hai Sect and played a part in it\u2019s destruction.\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They felt powerless and hopeless in front of their General who was suffering so much.The cavalry troops all felt very close to their general. If a soldier was attacked even if he was low ranked, Liu Cang Lan wouldn\u2019t hesitate to protect them\u2026Liu Cang Lan didn\u2019t kneel down in front of anything or anyone. He didn\u2019t even bow in front of the Emperor but at this moment, he kowtowed more than he ever had in his entire life.\u201cThe Yun Hai Sect has given everything to me but I escaped. How shameless can I be?\u201dLiu Cang Lan looked desperate which filled all the soldiers with emotion. They shouted in unison: \u201cGeneral!\u201dA strong Qi was released into the atmosphere and he raised his arm in preparation to cripple his own cultivation. The soldiers were staring at him and suddenly, there was no movement. Liu Cang Lan was as motionless as the corpses surrounding him and there was complete silence in the gorge.\u201cCoward!\u201dA cold and indifferent voice filled the entire gorge. When everybody heard the voice, they looked stupefied.Coward? Was Liu Cang Lan a coward?\u201cSince you abandoned the Yun Hai Sect, you also played a role in its destruction. You must pay with your life.\u201dThese words made the soldiers extremely furious. Lin Feng was the person who had said those words to Liu Cang Lan. Since he had insulted Liu Cang Lan, he had to die.\u201cPssshhhhh\u2026.\u201dAt that moment, an incredible force and Qi moved straight towards Lin Feng\u2019s body.The soldiers on the Chi Xie armored horses were releasing such a strong and powerful energy. Lin Feng felt completely oppressed and had the sensation his bones were going to explode. Only these cavalry troops were able to release such a strong Qi.Lin Feng was almost collapsing under the weight of that Qi but he remained calm as before looking at Liu Cang Lan on the fighting stage of the Life and Death Arena.\u201cYou are already a walking corpse. Duan Tian Lang achieved his aim long ago. No need to try and escape again. He just used you and doesn\u2019t need you anymore.\u201dAll the soldiers were furious but Liu Cang Lan raised his head and looked up at the top of the gorge.\u201cYou are ready to die and your daughter, Liu Fei, can now become a member of the Duan family. You don\u2019t need to worry about her.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s words were like a sharp sword that cut into Liu Cang Lan. Liu Cang Lan was stunned. Was his daughter Liu Fei going to marry Duan Han?!\u201cWhen you die, maybe all those that have died for the Yun Hai Sect will be able to rest in peace because they will know that they have died for nothing. There was no hope for you.\u201dEach and every single word that Lin Feng said was like a sharp sword. Liu Cang Lan closed his eyes and slowly put his hand down.That\u2019s right. Liu Cang Lan had abandoned everything and everyone. Could it be that Liu Fei was really going to become one of the Duan\u2019s though? What was to be done if she married Duan Han? They had exterminated the Yun Hai Sect\u2026 So who was left to protect Liu Fei?When they saw that Liu Cang Lan had put his hand down, the soldiers didn\u2019t feel angry at Lin Feng anymore. They were grateful because they understood that Lin Feng had been using these harsh words to stimulate Liu Cang Lan to prevent him from crippling his own cultivation or even ending his own life.Good that Lin Feng was here, otherwise Liu Cang Lan would have probably killed himself here.But Lin Feng\u2019s words had been really harsh. Each time, they had resonated in Liu Cang Lan\u2019s heart and only increased his sorrow.\u201cTake care of your General. The Yun Hai Sect doesn\u2019t hate or blame him. Protector Bei was always worried about him. The wife of the former Patriarch also respected and admired him. She also forgave him for everything that happened in the past. Make sure that he remembers this.\u201dLin Feng had stopped looking at Liu Cang Lan and had walked towards the cavalry seated on the Chi Xie armored horses and while still holding Meng Qing\u2019s hand, he said these words to the soldiers.A while after Lin Feng left, Liu Cang Lan opened his eyes and a sharp and determined light flashed through them which made his army delighted. Their General was back.\u201cEverybody help me bury my fellow sect members. Let\u2019s allow the dead to rest in peace. This is an order.\u201dLiu Cang Lan\u2019s voice was calm but still firm.\u201cFrom today onwards, you have to guard the territory of the Yun Hai Sect. Without my permission, don\u2019t let anybody into its territory. If they try to enter by force, kill them without mercy.\u201dLiu Cang Lan was strict with his commands. When he finished talking, everybody shouted in unison: \u201cAt your command!\u201dLiu Cang Lan looked expressionless. He climbed back up onto the top of the gorge and gazed into the distance as if he was looking for Lin Feng.\u201cGeneral.\u201dAt that moment, a soldier walked towards Liu Cang Lan and stopped in front of him.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Liu Cang Lan.\u201cGeneral, that young man earlier told me to tell you that the Yun Hai Sect doesn\u2019t blame or hate you. Protector Bei was worried about you every day and that the wife of the former Patriarch forgave you for everything. She also admired and respected you at the end.\u201dLiu Cang Lan was standing while speechless and motionless.He raised his hand and looked at the sky. That powerful and battle hardened man\u2026 had tears flowing from his eyes.\u201cForgive this unworthy disciple\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026After a while Liu Cang Lan took a deep breath and stopped crying. He could see a silhouette on the horizon.\u201cLin Feng!\u201dLiu Cang Lan had never seen Lin Feng but Liu Fei had told him a lot about him. He wanted to know what kind of young man had inspired so many people in the Yun Hai Sect\u2026 and also why he had just saved him from ending his own life.At that moment, Liu Cang Lan gradually started to understand that Lin Feng was probably not an ordinary person.If Lin Feng was an ordinary person then could he have used such words when talking to Liu Cang Lan?If Lin Feng was an ordinary sixteen year old teenager, could he have resisted the Qi of the cavalry on the Chi Xie armored horses without collapsing?If Lin Feng was an ordinary teenager, he wouldn\u2019t have come back to the Yun Hai Sect, rather, he would have left and never come back. After all, Duan Tian Lang and many others wanted to kill him.Lin Feng didn\u2019t leave the Yun Hai Sect even though Protector Bei had told him to go to Duan Ren City to look for Liu Cang Lan. He was never planning to leave the corpses of his sect to be defiled; he would stay and protect them so that the dead could rest easy. However now that he had seen Liu Cang Lan arrive with his troops, he had decided to leave because Liu Cang Lan\u2019s army would be more capable of protecting the Yun Hai Sect territory than him. They were all extremely powerful and there were such a large number of them.Lin Feng, knew that the Imperial Clan was the strongest within the Xue Yue Country. But in the Continent of the Nine Clouds, there were people who were even stronger than the Emperor.There were people in the continent that could destroy the entire Xue Yue Country if they wished to.Lin Feng wanted to reach such heights.At that moment, Lin Feng and Meng Qing were standing on a huge rock. Lin Feng saw Liu Cang Lan\u2019s silhouette descending the mountain at full speed.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d They jumped from the big rock and took a small road. They starting moving farther away from the approaching Liu Cang Lan.\u201cAren\u2019t there many questions that you would like to ask me?\u201dLin Feng asked Meng Qing in a low voice.\u201cIf you don\u2019t tell me, I will not ask.\u201d replied Meng Qing in an indifferent tone. It seemed like her heart had never been moved before. Lin Feng wanted to know if she ever smiled or laughed.\u201cMy mother says that when a man is sad, the best is to let him keep his thoughts to himself and not to ask anything.\u201dLin Feng wasn\u2019t expecting her to continue speaking. She was staring at Lin Feng. It seemed like she wanted to verify her mother\u2019s statement and check its authenticity.\u201cEverything that you know of the outside world is what your mother has told you?\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d said Meng Qing while nodding.\u201cWhat else has your mother told you about men?\u201d asked Lin Feng. Lin Feng had the feeling that he knew nothing about the world even though he had memories from two different worlds and Meng Qing, she only memories of the Black Wind Mountain.\u201cMy mother also said that\u2026 well, none of these things are good.\u201d replied Meng Qing.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Lin Feng was surprised. He looked at Meng Qing, his eyes filled with curiosity. It seemed like Meng Qing was about to tell him some private things. Could it be that her mother had decided to live in seclusion in the hinterland of the Black Wind Mountain because she had been emotionally hurt in the past?\u201cShe told me how horrible and disgusting men were but you seem to be a really good man. What my mother told me doesn\u2019t apply to you.\u201dHer beautiful face looked so cute as if she didn\u2019t understand what she was talking about. She was definitely very curious to discover the world, which is why she secretly escaped with Lin Feng.Lin Feng could not help but let out a laugh. It really felt good to laugh after everything that happened.\u201cAre there other things? What else did your mother tell you?\u201d\u201cShe told me a lot of things.\u201d said Meng Qing while nodding. She then looked at Lin Feng and said: \u201cbut I\u2019m not telling you these things.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Imperial City, the Xue Yue Country\u2026 both were extremely vast.Billions of people were living in the Imperial City but it never looked overcrowded.The Imperial City had huge roads. Several Hundreds of people could walk side by side on some of its large roadsIn the Imperial City, there were mostly pedestrians. Even those who had horses often didn\u2019t ride them in the city but led them by hand.In the Imperial City, there were multiple incredibly strong cultivators who had become rich. They could gather many items by killing extremely strong ferocious beasts and had slowly gathered a fortune. Many of them had extremely expensive horses.A few days later, it would be the inauguration of the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue. All the strongest disciples of the biggest sects of the country would be there. The Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue was greedy and was always longing for more geniuses.Many young cultivators, from the age of six to the age of eighteen were hoping to be able to join the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue. In such conditions, they probably would be able to become a great cultivator in the future. The Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue was going to be the best cultivation academy in the history of the country.At that moment, some silhouettes were walking on the main road. They attracted everybody\u2019s attention. Amongst the group of people, there was a girl who was wearing red robed. She looked very beautiful. An ice and fire Qi was emerging endlessly from her body.\u201cThese people all want to become members of the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue\u2026 but what they don\u2019t know is that it is extremely hard to join it. Only geniuses can gain entry. How many people have what is required to join?\u201dA teenager said in a low voice. It made the girl in the red robes smile coldly. That girl wearing red robes was Lin Qian.\u201cI heard that Na Lan Feng has returned to the Imperial City too. I heard that the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue is really interested in her. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not.\u201dLin Hong who was standing next to Lin Qian said this which had stupefied Lin Qian. The last time they had seen other, they hadn\u2019t been able to battle properly to find out which of them was stronger.Lin Qian remembered the annual tournament in Yangzhou City. She couldn\u2019t help but recall that piece of trash that had been expelled from the Lin Clan.He had surprised everybody at the annual tournament. He had even scared everyone with the power he held. He was truly a terrifying genius.But in Yangzhou City, a myriad of people still didn\u2019t even know Lin Feng\u2019s name.She remembered how Lin Feng had been able to leave Yangzhou City by simply taking Na Lan Feng as a hostage in front of everybody.\u201cNow that the Yun Hai Sect doesn\u2019t exist anymore, he is probably dead.\u201dLin Qian didn\u2019t know if that was a good thing though. She did not understand why she had mixed feeling after hearing of his death.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It only had about a few thousand inhabitants.It was said that in that small town, there was a noble in decline whose family name was Duan. He apparently belonged to the Imperial Clan but had been expelled because of internal conflicts. After having been expelled, he moved to his small town.Of course, the people that lived in the small town did not believe the rumours. How could a member of the Duan clan end up in such a small town?That noble had a large courtyard in front of his house in the small town in front of which there were two huge carriages. It looked like they were getting ready to go on a long journey.\u201cSister, let\u2019s go.\u201dA young boy, who was about fourteen, said to a gorgeous girl who was stood in front of him.That gorgeous girl looked as if she was going to cry. She was gazing at the horizon. She was staring in the direction of the Yun Hai Sect and her eyes had revealed a great sorrow.She would have never thought that when she left the Yun Hai Sect, it would get annihilated. Everybody had died\u2026 everybody.\u201cAlright.\u201dWhen the girl heard the boy, she tried to smile and slightly nodded. She then said: \u201cI\u2019m getting into the carriage now, let\u2019s leave.\u201d\u201cSister, don\u2019t worry. Wait until we arrive in the Imperial City. Our brother will introduce you to some handsome and talented boys.\u201dThe girl shook her head and nearly laughed at the idea.\u201cEverybody is waiting, we should make our way.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d said the young boy while nodding and walked over to the gate.\u201cJing Yun, you and the young master should take this carriage.\u201d said a young guard hastily while looking at Jing Yun. He was thinking that Jing Yun was growing more beautiful. He wished she could become his wife, but knew that he could only dream.\u201cIndeed, Jing Yun, you need to have a rest. Old Wang and I are outside.\u201d said another young man while smiling.\u201cSister, they are right. Let\u2019s sit.\u201d said the young master whose family name was Duan while pushing Jing Yun inside the carriage. Even though Jing Yun had been a servant in their family since she was a child, the young master was like a sibling to her.Jing Yun didn\u2019t refuse and went into the spacious carriage.At the same time, Lin Feng and Meng Qing arrived in Yun Yang.\u201cI hope that we\u2019ll find a horse or a carriage which we can use.\u201d said Lin Feng.He felt desperate since it would be unlikely for him to find a horse or carriage for sale in such a small town. He couldn\u2019t help but force a wry smile. His goal was to go to the Imperial City which was a great distance from that small town. Travelling there by foot wasn\u2019t a realistic option. Lin Feng had completely neglected that aspect when leaving the Yun Hai Sect. He did not plan ahead and instead started to travel towards the capital on foot.\u201cIs that a carriage over there?\u201dMeng Qing was pointing to a place in the horizon and asked Lin Feng with her usual indifferent tone. Lin Feng raised his hand and looked to where she was pointing. He saw a few carriages coming towards them.\u201cWhat a coincidence.\u201dLin Feng smiled and started walking towards the carriages. When they saw the youth approaching the carriages, the carriages were brought to a stop.\u201cWho are you? Let us pass.\u201d shouted a young man furiously at Lin Feng who was blocking the way.\u201cMy friend, you are only using one carriage and you still have others. Could we borrow one of them? I would happily give you a huge sum of money in exchange.\u201dLin Feng was smiling at the young man and remained very polite.Inside the carriage, Jing Yun anxiously opened the curtains when she heard the familiar voice. When she saw Lin Feng, she couldn\u2019t but feel overjoyed.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, we will need them later, we cannot let you use them.\u201d replied Old Wang while pulling on the reins.\u201cExactly. Get out of our way this instant. We don\u2019t need your money.\u201d shouted a young man wearing black robes which surprised Lin Feng a little. There was no need to get that angry over something like this, after all Lin Feng had remained polite. It wasn\u2019t a problem if they couldn\u2019t give him a positive answer, but they had no need to be rude.\u201cLin Feng.\u201dA voice came from inside the carriage. Jing Yun rushed out of her carriage to speak with Lin Feng. She had a big warm smile on her face. He hadn\u2019t died. The Yun Hai Sect had been annihilated but Lin Feng had surprisingly survived.\u201cJing Yun!\u201dLin Feng was stupefied when he saw Jing Yun. She looked as resplendent and beautiful as she did before. She looked as fresh as a spring breeze.\u201cJing Yun, who is that?\u201dAt that moment, the young man in black robes moved down from his horse and stood in front Lin Feng. He then arrogantly looked at Lin Feng.\u201cLin Feng, you\u2019re really alive! What happened to the Yun Hai Sect?\u201d said Jing Yun as if she couldn\u2019t believe her eyes. She quickly moved next to Lin Feng which made the young boy in black robes grow terribly angry. His expression became extremely cold.Lin Feng was looking at her in a very strange way and then said: \u201cJing Yun, you really don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cI really don\u2019t know. When the second round of the Elite Disciple Exam took place, I had to leave because the young master wanted me to come back and go to the Imperial City. I had to accompany him as it is my duty. I thought that I would go back to the sect a few days later but\u2026 but\u2026\u201d Jing Yun was unable to keep speaking. She had been worries to death at the event, it was like a nightmare for her.\u201cI see.\u201d Lin Feng was happy that Jing Yun hadn\u2019t been there on that day, otherwise\u2026\u2026..\u201cJing Yun, who is that?\u201dAt that moment, the coach driver, Old Wang, asked Jing Yun again.\u201cUncle Wang, this is my friend, Lin Feng. He is also a disciple of the Yun Hai Sect.\u201dJing Yun pulled Lin Feng and introduced him to Uncle Wang.\u201cI see.\u201d replied Uncle Wang while slightly nodding his head.\u201cPfff, the Yun Hai Sect has been destroyed. How can he still be alive?\u201d said the arrogant young man in black when he noticed how enthusiastic Jing Yun and Lin Feng were. Jing Yun was surprised at his response.\u201cWan Qing Shan, what\u2019s the problem?\u201dJing Yun said with an ice-cold tone. She was actually angry that he was acting this way.\u201cYou should know what I mean.\u201d continued Wan Qing Shan angrily while staring at Lin Feng.Jing Yun was just an ordinary disciple of the Yun Hai Sect. Since Lin Feng was Jing Yun\u2019s acquaintance, he was probably an ordinary disciple as well. He had probably reached the eighth or ninth Qi layer. Of course, Wan Qing Shan wasn\u2019t going to pay attention to someone as weak as Lin Feng.Besides, the Yun Hai Sect had been destroyed so Lin Feng was probably drifting and living without purpose like a beggar.Lin Feng shook his head and decided to ignore Wan Qing Shan.\u201cJing Yun, are you going to the Imperial City?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d said Jing Yun while nodding her head.\u201cVery good. I am heading there as well. Can you lend me a carriage? We can travel together.\u201d\u201cReally? Let me ask the young master. There should be no problem with you joining us.\u201d When Jing Yun heard that Lin Feng was going to the Imperial City as well, she felt delighted.\u201cJing Yun, it doesn\u2019t look too good.\u201dUncle Wang said that to Jing Yun on a cold and detached tone.\u201cUncle Wang, Lin Feng is also a disciple of the Yun Hai Sect. He is quite strong. He can also help the guards.\u201d\u201cExactly, I could help the guards.\u201d nodded Lin Feng.\u201cThe Yun Hai Sect has been exterminated and even if he\u2019s strong, we don\u2019t need more guards.\u201d said Wan Qing Shan coldly.\u201cJing Yun, you know what our purpose is. It\u2019s not very convenient to have him with us but letting him accompany us on a part of the journey is no problem.\u201d said Uncle Wang after considering the situation. The other carriages were ready to use anyway. Besides, if there was a problem, Lin Feng could indeed be useful.He eventually accepted Lin Feng into to escort party.\u201cUncle Wang, it\u2019s alright, let him come with me.\u201dAt that moment, the young master came out of the carriage and said while smiling at Lin Feng: \u201cMy name is Duan Feng.\u201d\u201cLin Feng.\u201d replied Lin Feng while slightly nodding his head and smiling. His name was similar to Lin Feng\u2019s but it had a different meaning.\u201cYoung master\u2026..\u201d said uncle Wang while looking at Duan Feng who wanted to say something but Duan Feng interrupted him and said: \u201cUncle Wang, I am with Jing Yun in the carriage, there will be no problem. Of course, our new fellow Lin Feng can sit with us so that we can all speak together.\u201d\u201cYoung Master, how can you accept such a thing?\u201d asked Wan Qing Shan surprised to see that Duan Feng allowed Lin Feng to sit with them. At that moment, he didn\u2019t seem very happy. The other guard also pulled a long face.\u201cYoung Master\u2026 your status\u2026 how can you sit with such people?\u201d said the other young man who also didn\u2019t agree.\u201cWhat\u2019s the relation between my status and\u2026? Ah, never mind. Stop talking now. If I say he can, then he can, is that clear?\u201d said Duan Feng strictly and then added: \u201cLin Feng, big brother, please come into the carriage.\u201cWait, wait, I still have a friend.\u201dLin Feng turned around and saw that Meng Qing was still standing behind. He then called her loudly: \u201cMeng Qing!\u201dWhen she heard him, Meng Qing slowly came to Lin Feng and then stayed behind him.When these guards saw the extraordinarily beautiful Meng Qing, they were stupefied. They found her absolutely gorgeous. They thought that her beauty was infinite.\u201cWhat a beautiful young girl!\u201dA moment before, nobody had paid attention to Meng Qing. The old man Wang was also astonished.Jing Yun was also a beautiful girl but next to Meng Qing, she was obviously invisible. Meng Qing could make most men lose their soul to her beauty. She was infinitely beautiful.At that moment, Jing Yun noticed Meng Qing. When she saw Meng Qing standing behind Lin Feng, she couldn\u2019t help but pull a long face.\u201cThat girl is very beautiful. Lin Feng, big brother, since she is your friend, she can obviously join us.\u201dDuan Feng was a very warm and enthusiastic person.\u201cIndeed, Lin Feng, let\u2019s sit down inside the carriage.\u201d said Jing Yun while smiling and nodding.\u201cLet\u2019s go inside.\u201d said Lin Feng to Meng Qing. Then, they immediately went into the carriage.Wan Qing Shan was extremely jealous when he saw that beautiful girl.\u201cThat little boy\u2026 I have to show him\u2026 Pfff, a disciple of the Yun Hai Sect\u2026 is that a joke?\u201dWan Qing Shan envied Lin Feng who was sitting inside the carriage with two amazingly beautiful girls.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 - The Celestial AcademyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe three Qian Li Xue horses were galloping at full speed down the large road.Inside the carriage, Duan Feng and Jing Yun were sitting next to each while Lin Feng and Meng Qing were sitting next to each. Both pairs were sat face to face.\u201cLin Feng, how did Meng Qing and you get to know each other?\u201dJing Yun was staring at Meng Qing but Meng Qing remained expressionless since the beginning. It seemed like the muscles on her face hadn\u2019t moved at all. The fact that she was expressionless though actually made her even more beautiful. Her beauty was truly breathtaking.Jing Yun didn\u2019t ask Lin Feng how he had survived the massacre of the Yun Hai Sect because she was scared to touch on Lin Feng\u2019s fresh wound. It was obvious that he was still greatly wounded in his heart. It was strange though, Lin Feng had survived and all the others had died.Of course, Jing Yun wasn\u2019t going to blame Lin Feng for that. On the contrary, she was very happy that Lin Feng had survived. The fact that he was alive was the most important thing to her right now.\u201cWe met in the mountains.\u201dLin Feng vaguely replied to Jing Yun because Meng Qing might not have appreciated if Lin Feng shared her past with others.\u201cOh, well, why are you heading to the Imperial City then?\u201d asked Jing YunThe Imperial City was full of extremely strong cultivators. It was the place which held the best cultivators of the Xue Yue Country. There were also a great deal of them looking for Lin Feng.\u201cBecause there are a great many people in the Imperial City.\u201d replied Lin Feng but Jing Yun didn\u2019t hear him.\u201cAnd you, Jing Yun? Why are you going to the Imperial City?\u201d asked Lin Feng while looking at Jing Yun and Duan Feng. From what Jing Yun had told Lin Feng before, it seemed that Duan Feng had asked for her to accompany him to the Imperial City and that he was going there because he had people to meet. Duan Feng had to leave immediately and travel all the way from his small town without stop which meant the people he had to meet were most likely not ordinary people.Jing Yun glanced at Duan Feng who was sitting next to her. Duan Feng was laughing and said: \u201cLin Feng, big brother, Jing Yun is accompanying me to the Imperial City because my big brother wants me to go there to practice cultivation at a cultivation academy.\u201d\u201cAcademy?\u201d said Lin Feng looking perplexed and then asked: \u201cThe Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d said Duan Feng while shaking his head: \u201cThe Celestial Academy.\u201d\u201cThe Celestial Academy?\u201d Lin Feng was surprised. He had never heard of the Celestial Academy.\u201cIndeed, the Celestial Academy.\u201d Duan Feng said while nodding and then added: \u201cThe Celestial Academy is not very famous. Not many people know about it. Actually, it doesn\u2019t accept external applicants. Someone who is already there has to recommend you which is why my big brother recommended me.\u201d\u201cRecommend? Not external applicants?\u201d Lin Feng was surprised. Were academies like sects but with a slight difference?In a sect, like the Yun Hai Sect, there was a countless number of disciples. They were then separated into different classes: ordinary, elite and core disciples. Then, there were the ordinary and the elite elders. The hierarchy was extremely strict and disciples had to rely almost exclusively on their own abilities to climb up in the hierarchy and to receive consideration from the sect.Academies were something new in the Xue Yue Country. They only accepted young people who were extremely talented. They had cultivation teachers and received the best weapons and other resources. Teachers helped the juniors to become strong cultivators.Before, in the Xue Yue Country, there were no academies. It was a concept which had come from another land. Therefore, there were very few academies in the country and they were not famous at all. They couldn\u2019t be compared with the foundation of the large sects.The establishment of the Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue enabled some of the most outstanding and talented young cultivators to receive instruction. The Holy Courtyard of Xue Yue was being established to counterbalance the importance of sects and less popular academies within the country.\u201cLin Feng, brother, you are a Yun Hai Sect disciple. You\u2019re probably just as strong as Jing Yun. When the right moment comes, I\u2019ll talk to my big brother and see if there\u2019s a way for you to join the Celestial Academy.\u201dDuan Feng was smiling sincerely. Even though he was still very young, he was already very mature. Besides, he had a strong personality considering the way he had talked to these arrogant guards.\u201cOh yes! Lin Feng, you should come to the Celestial Academy.\u201dJing Yun\u2019s expression started to brighten. The Yun Hai Sect had been annihilated so if Lin Feng joined the Celestial Academy then it wouldn\u2019t be treason against the sect. Besides, Jing Yun didn\u2019t even ask herself if Lin Feng was strong enough.During the first round of the Elite Disciple Exam, Jing Yun had seen with her own eyes how strong Lin Feng was. He had killed an elite disciple with a single strike from his sword and had then become an elite disciple.Lin Feng was laughing but didn\u2019t reply. Even though the Yun Hai Sect had been annihilated, Lin Feng was the new Patriarch of the Yun Hai Sect!\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The carriage was already far away from the small town. The evening sun was shining down on the earth. Inside of the carriage, Lin Feng, Duan Feng and Jing Yun were unceasingly chatting while Meng Qing was quiet and had closed her eyes. She looked like she had fallen asleep. She looked extremely peaceful and serene as she rocked back and forth with the carriage.Lin Feng took off his top and wrapped it around Meng Qing\u2019s shoulder. The temperature was quite low and Meng Qing had put on such light weight robes.At that moment, Jing Yun made a weird face.A short while after, Meng Qing opened her eyes, looked around her and noticed Lin Feng\u2019s top wrapped around her shoulder. She looked very surprised. She had never experienced such a thing before so she found it quite strange.\u201cBroom vroom vroom\u2026.\u201d the carriage suddenly started shaking.At that moment, Uncle Wang pulled on the reins and stopped the carriage. The ground was still shaking. It was getting more and more intense.\u201cUncle Wang, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d asked Duan Feng from inside.\u201cYoung master, there are thieves. Don\u2019t come out. I will negotiate with them.\u201d said Uncle Wang strictly.Uncle Wang then went towards the thieves to negotiate with them.\u201cAhhh\u2026\u2026\u201dA short moment after, a horrible shriek was heard which scared those inside the carriage.\u201cSend me someone who knows how to talk!\u201d shouted an extremely aggressive voice.\u201cI\u2019m going to see.\u201d said Duan Feng hastily. He then immediately went out of the carriage followed closely by Lin Feng and Jing Yun. Meng Qing didn\u2019t follow them and stayed inside the carriage.Not far from the carriage there were a few dozens of thieves who didn\u2019t look very friendly.\u201cI\u2019m going to see .\u201d said one of the guards as he walked towards the thieves.\u201cEverybody, we\u2026\u2026\u201d said the young guard.These thieves were riding horses. One of them, who was holding a dagger in his hand, jumped off his horse and threw himself at the young guard.The young man was extremely surprised, he suddenly grabbed his spear and thrust it towards the dagger.But at that moment, the thief had already reached the young guard and slit his throat with the dagger. Blood was gushing from the young guard\u2019s throat as he fell lifelessly onto the ground.Jing Yun was stupefied. Because of all the blood which was so close to her, she was overcome with nausea. Her face turned deathly pale.\u201cI said, send me someone who knows how to speak! That girl doesn\u2019t seem too bad!\u201dThe thief was pointing at Jing Yun with his dagger. At that moment, all the other thieves laughed evilly.\u201cIndeed! Yes! We want to talk to that pretty girl!\u201d said the thieves in unison while thinking of other obscene things.When Jing Yun heard what these thieves were saying, her face looked even more livid.\u201cJing Yun, get into the carriage.\u201d said Lin Feng to Jing Yun while pushing her towards the carriage.\u201cLittle boy, you surprisingly dare hide the girl, you want to die\u2026\u201dEvery single thief was looking at Lin Feng furiously.\u201cIndeed, we have to kill that guy and take the girl to make us happy!\u201d\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201dWan Qing Shan was furiously shouting at Lin Feng. He was furious.Lin Feng was stupefied and coldly looking at Wan Qing Shan. What was he doing? It sounded like Wan Qing Shan wanted him to hand over Jing Yun to the thieves.\u201cYou little piece of trash. You\u2019re causing trouble. Now, this is your problem and if you want to escape, don\u2019t count on us to rescue you. We won\u2019t help you.\u201dWang Qing Shan was expressionless. He was curious to see what kind of disciples the Yun Hai Sect had.\u201cI don\u2019t need your kind of help.\u201d replied Lin Feng coldly before running towards the thieves.\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you guys for a while.\u201dLin Feng was standing close to the leader of the bandits as he spoke with a cold tone.\u201cYou want to die!\u201dA thief with a long dagger jumped towards Lin Feng while stabbing with his dagger, which emitted a whistling sound as it pierced through the air.Suddenly there was a dazzling light which filled the air. Lin Feng had unsheathed his soft sword.No one had seen his movement and he slowly began to sheath his sword. Suddenly blood splashed everywhere from the thieves throat. The thief was dead.Lin Feng\u2019s speed had greatly increased and his speed alone proved that Lin Feng was an extremely powerful cultivator. Therefore, he could carry out attacks very quickly. His sword skills were extremely high and he would often kill people with a single strike from his sword.How was this possible? How had that thief been killed with a single movement?\u201cHe was no good, Give me someone else to talk too, alright?\u201d said Lin Feng indifferently towards the thieves. Lin Feng had noticed how young some of them were.It seemed like only one sword strike had been enough to scare the majority of them.Wan Qing Shan was stupefied. He wasn\u2019t happy because Lin Feng had killed a thief, on the contrary, he was unpleasantly surprised to see that Lin Feng was so strong.They were unable to guess what Lin Feng\u2019s cultivation level was as he had only used a single quick strike. They only knew that he could use his sword extremely quickly to deal lethal strikes.\u201cMy friend, this thing has nothing to do with you. You don\u2019t need to get involved.\u201d said the leader of the thieves in a low voice to Lin Feng which showed how terrified he was. Lin Feng was stupefied.Lin Feng was suspicious though and said: \u201cDidn\u2019t you want to kill me a moment ago? I\u2019m waiting for you.\u201d\u201cHmph, since you are being like this then don\u2019t blame us for being impolite.\u201dThe leader of the thieves looked at all the other thieves and said: \u201cKill him.\u201dThree thieves headed towards Lin Feng at full speed. Lin Feng was surrounded by the attacks from three different people.\u201cDie.\u201dA thief had thrust his long dagger which was diffusing an extremely strong Qi towards Lin Feng\u2019s body. It was the same sensation as in the Stormy Gorge when he faced the soldiers Qi. However the difference between their strengths was like heaven and earth.\u201cDie.\u201dAnother voice filled the air. A long dagger was spinning in the air which looked incredibly dangerous.All the thieves on their horses were simultaneously moving towards Lin Feng to kill him.Lin Feng suddenly jumped up in the air. While it looked like he was seemingly floating in the air, he adopted a strange position. At that moment, he was at the same height as the thieves sitting on their horses.\u201cDeadly sword.\u201dLin Feng\u2019s sword was glowing and releasing a dazzling light into the atmosphere. It released an incredible amount of deadly Qi which created a vortex in the air. In the blink of an eye, the thieves were surrounded by an incredible amount of Qi.Lin Feng\u2019s deadly sword Qi suddenly had the shape of a magnificent arc as it slashed through the air. The horses were going insane and neighing. All the thieves were falling down lifelessly from the back of their horses one after the other.With a single sword strike, all of them had been killed!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - Traitor or notPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA strong smell of blood invaded the atmosphere. Everybody was calmly staring at the horses that were running around with nobody on their back.The leader of the thieves was looking at all these horses without anyone riding them with complete shock. He then looked at all the corpses that were spread across the floor and could not believe it. Only one sword strike and they had all died. That powerful attack was a masterpiece that killed everyone who stood in Lin Feng\u2019s path.\u201cLing Qi layer.\u201d Wan Qing Shan and the other young guard were stupefied. Lin Feng was way too strong. Provoking him was a mistake. No wonder that Jing Yun was particularly friendly to him. He was an extraordinary young man with amazing strength.Wan Qing Shan\u2019s back was covered with a cold sweat. He was provoking Lin Feng earlier. If Lin Feng had attacked him the same way as he attacked these few thieves, he would probably be\u2026\u2026\u2026..Uncle Wang still sitting at the front of the carriage was stunned. He was blankly staring at Lin Feng\u2019s back.\u201cFriend, aren\u2019t your methods a bit cruel?\u201d said the leader of the thieves looking furious.\u201cWhen you kill people and rob them on the roadside, do you care about the fact that you might be cruel?\u201dLin Feng\u2019s tone was ice-cold. Thieves were the kind of people who never felt bad when they killed other people but became furious if one of them was killed. They thought that killing was like a game but they didn\u2019t like losing.Lin Feng started walking forwards. A strong energy enveloped the leader of the thieves which made him shiver from head to toe.\u201cFriend, take one more step and you\u2019ll die.\u201d said the chief of the thieves threatening Lin Feng.\u201cOne more step? But there are still more steps between us.\u201d said Lin Feng while running towards him releasing an incredible amount of sword Qi.The leader of the thieves did not expect him to not even hesitate and started to grind his teeth in anger. He took out his long dagger and suddenly the strong and violent Qi invaded the atmosphere.\u201cHe is also at the Ling Qi layer.\u201d thought Wan Qing Shan who was stupefied. A thief had surprisingly reached the Ling Qi layer. But none of them would be able to defeat Lin Feng anyway.Lin Feng groaned. It seemed like thief\u2019s long dagger was shaking in fear because of the energy of Lin Feng\u2019s sword. Lin Feng\u2019s sword was moving towards the thief at full speed. Even though it wasn\u2019t diffusing any light, his sword contained an incredible amount of energy. There was no light because Lin Feng was condensing the energy of his deadly sword skill back into his sword.\u201cPssshhhh\u2026.\u201dA whistling sound spread in the atmosphere. Lin Feng\u2019 sword was moving towards the thief\u2019s throat at full speed. His long dagger hadn\u2019t blocked the attack at all.Lin Feng was getting more and more familiar with his sword each day. He was becoming more and more agile as well as quicker and quicker. The thief heavily fell on the ground with a look of shock covering his face.\u201cEven a cultivator of the Ling Qi layer can\u2019t stop Lin Feng. How incredibly strong!\u201dEverybody was astonished by Lin Feng\u2019s strength. He was way too strong. Lin Feng had killed that thief, who had broken through to the Ling Qi layer with a single stroke of his sword. It had looked like it had taken no effort from him.Lin Feng didn\u2019t even look at the corpses, he just turned around and walked back towards his group.\u201cLin Feng, big brother, you are very strong.\u201dDuan Feng was smiling at Lin Feng with admiration.\u201cIt is perfectly understandable why Lin Feng was in one of the largest sects. We wouldn\u2019t ever be able to achieve such a thing. He is so strong\u201dWan Qing Shan was walking towards Lin Feng while flattering him.If someone was only slightly stronger than him, he would envy them and bully them with his status, but if somebody was much stronger than him, he was either scared or filled with admiration.\u201cSomeone who survived the extermination of a great sect has to be strong.\u201d replied Lin Feng with a detached tone. He looked a little disdainful as well.Lin Feng had never considered himself as merciful. When Wan Qing Shan still thought that he was weak, he didn\u2019t hesitate and humiliate Lin Feng. It is not out of mercy that Lin Feng hadn\u2019t attacked him but because Jing Yun, Duan Feng and the others were there. After all, he was the guest.Now that he had shown that he was strong, Wan Qing Shan wanted to make friends with him but Lin Feng didn\u2019t feel like it.When Wan Qing Shan heard Lin Feng\u2019s cold tone of speech, he became angry again but kept it to himself this time. Provoking Lin Feng again would be a reckless act. Lin Feng was able to easily kill cultivators of the Ling Qi layer. Provoking him would be too dangerous. If he made Lin Feng angry, Wan Qing Shan might not take another breath.Wan Qing Shan moved away in a bad mood.\u201cLin Feng, let\u2019s go.\u201d said Duan Feng ready to get back into the carriage.\u201cYoung master.\u201dAt that moment, Uncle Wang was in front of the carriage and called Duan Feng which surprised him. Duan Feng asked: \u201cUncle Wang, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cYoung Master, it is not appropriate to travel with Lin Feng. Give him a carriage for him and his friend.\u201d said Uncle Wang which surprised everybody.He suddenly wanted to get rid of Lin Feng? \u2026but having a cultivator of the Ling Qi layer with them was perfect protection from most bandits and thieves. It would make their journey much safer. After all the greatest threat they would meet on the road would be Ling Qi Layer thieves and bandits.Lin Feng\u2019s eyes were wide open in shock. He didn\u2019t understand what the old man meant.\u201cUncle Wang, what\u2019s wrong? Lin Feng and I making friends. It is a stroke of luck as well as a pleasure to be able to travel with Lin Feng.\u201d replied Duan Feng who didn\u2019t understand.\u201cYoung master, don\u2019t be naive. There are dangerous things. There are things which you cannot understand because you are too young.\u201dUncle Wang was shaking his head and sighing.\u201cLin Feng, let\u2019s do it this way. You can have one of these carriages\u2026 you can even have both of them if you feel like it. This is a present to thank you for saving us. What do you think?\u201d said Uncle Wang while looking at Lin Feng.Lin Feng frowned and asked Uncle Wang: \u201cWhat are you implying?\u201dDangerous things? What was he talking about?\u201cYoung Lin Feng asks many questions but understands what I mean deep in his heart.\u201d said Uncle Wang while shaking his head.\u201cI understand nothing of what you\u2019re saying. Give me a hint.\u201d\u201cYoung man, since you are insisting, I will tell you. Don\u2019t blame me.\u201dUncle Wang paused and then continued while staring at Lin Feng: \u201cYoung man, these thieves were not weak. If they had attacked us, they would have easily defeated us but they were looking for someone to talk. Maybe it would have worked but you immediately killed them.\u201d\u201cYou would want to talk to these thieves.\u201d Lin Feng was puzzled.\u201cThis is only my opinion but it is wrong that Lin Feng killed all of these thieves without trying even a single time to negotiate with them.\u201d added Uncle Wang aggressively.Not even trying to negotiate?That time, Lin Feng understood what Uncle Wang meant. He could help but smile coldly and say to Uncle Wang: \u201cWhat you are trying to say is that I am just like these thieves, that I kill for pleasure? and maybe that I\u2019m a thief too?\u201d\u201cA moment ago, the leader of these thieves was calmly talking to Lin Feng but we didn\u2019t hear what he was saying.\u201dUncle Wang didn\u2019t immediately reply to Lin Feng and carefully replied. Lin Feng was stunned. He dared to say that the leader of the thieves had talked calmly!\u201cWell, are there other things you would like to blame me for?\u201d said Lin Feng while smiling coldly.\u201cExactly! Lin Feng is right! Uncle Wang, you\u2019re way too heartless. Treating Lin Feng as if he hadn\u2019t tricked himself to help us. Thanks be to him, we are still alive and still have all of our things. How can you criticize Lin Feng like that?\u201dDuan Feng said while coming down of the carriage.\u201cYoung master, you are only a child. You cannot distinguish good and bad.\u201d said Uncle Wang while shaking his head and sighing.\u201cYoung Master, if I am talking to you like this, it is because I want you to understand who you are and how people will attempt to use your status. You are going to the Imperial City which in some ways is your heritage. You are not just anybody.\u201d\u201cOf course, I know!\u201d replied Duan Feng while nodding.\u201cSince it is like that, young master, I want to ask you, does your family have anything to do with Duan Tian Lang?\u201dDuan Feng was surprised. Why would Uncle Wang suddenly talk about Duan Tian Lang? What did he have to do with that whole story?\u201cI know that he is also part of my Duan clan. I also know that our relations are not harmonious.\u201d replied Duan Feng.\u201cYoung master, since you know that, think again. Isn\u2019t it Duan Tian Lang who annihilated the Yun Hai Sect? Then shortly after, Lin Feng arrives in our small town of Yun Yang when he suddenly comes across us. Wasn\u2019t it too much to be a coincidence?\u201dLin Feng was speechless when he heard Uncle Wang\u2019s words. Uncle Wang thought that Duan Tian Lang had made Lin Feng betray his sect and then sent him to the small town to find Duan Feng.\u201cUncle Wang, you think too much. Lin Feng could have already easily killed us.\u201d\u201cAlright\u2026 but young master, remember that your big brother asked you to come to the Imperial City and then, suddenly Lin Feng appears from nowhere and then kills an army of thieves to save us\u2026 doesn\u2019t he want us to return the favour in some way?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201dsaid Lin Feng coldly to Uncle Wang who kept talking over and over again. Uncle Wang\u2019s goal was obvious. He wanted Lin Feng to leave. He could talk as much nonsense as he wished, all of his words served one single purpose.Lin Feng looked inside the carriage and said to Meng Qing: \u201cMeng Qing, we are leaving.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d replied Meng Qing while nodding and coming out of the carriage.\u201cLin Feng, let me convince Uncle Wang!\u201d said Jing Yun hastily.\u201cLin Feng, you and Meng Qing get back into the carriage. I trust you!\u201d begged Duan Feng.\u201cNo need. I would be humiliating myself.\u201d said Lin Feng while glancing at Uncle Wang. He then looked at Duan Feng and Jing Yun and said: \u201cLet\u2019s meet in the Imperial City.\u201dWhen Lin Feng finished talking, he pulled Meng Qing sleeve and started leaving.\u201cLin Feng, maybe that it is only a coincidence and I have misunderstood you. What I said a moment ago is still valid, you can choose any of these carriages, as you please.\u201d said Uncle Wang.\u201cNo need. Thank you.\u201dLin Feng refused the old man\u2019s proposition. Lin Feng wasn\u2019t shameless. He wasn\u2019t going to use the carriages of people who had just humiliated him and suggested that he might be a traitor to his sect.He had just killed all these thieves, weren\u2019t there enough horses to use?\u201cCan you ride a horse?\u201d asked Lin Feng to Meng Qing.\u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d said Meng Qing while shaking her head.\u201cBut do you want to teach me how to ride?\u201d asked Meng Qing to Lin Feng\u201cMe, teach you how to ride a horse?\u201d said Lin Feng surprised: \u201cyou want me to teach you how to ride a horse?\u201dMeng Qing was staring blankly at Lin Feng which made Lin Feng smile.Anything Meng Qing would ask, Lin Feng would agree. At that moment, he said: \u201cAlright.\u201dWhen Lin Feng finished talking, another surprising thing happened!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
